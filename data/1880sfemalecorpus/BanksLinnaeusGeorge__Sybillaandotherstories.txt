CHAPTER I.

THE NEW HOME, AND THE OLD WHEEL.

HE ancient manor of Timperley,
on the north-east border of
Cheshire, has not been held by
a Timperley for more than two
centuries, so long is it since it was carried
by co-heiresses into other families, only to
be finally merged in the estate of Dunham-massey.
And though the old black and
white Hall still clings to the soil, and to
the name of Timperley, and stands within
its own demesne, it has no longer a lordly

VOL. I. A

tenant, and is but one of the scattered
homesteads now inhabited by merchant
traders from the great commercial city
within a brief railway ride. For here and
there, besides the few small farms and cottage
homes these old places dot the undulating
landscape, almost lost amid their
own oaks and sycamores, and hard to find
amid the maze of winding lanes and
streams, o'er which the willow and the ash
wave graceful foliage. Fortunately for
pedestrian wayfarers, bridges, mostly of
stone, span these flowing waters ; ay, and
waters that are not flowing, for over the
serpentine lakelet, which separates the
picturesque garden ground of the Oak-lands
from the meadow-land, more than
one bridge has been thrown for private
convenience.

Neither, though tinted by time, dates
back to the far antiquity of the manageable
homestead, and one may have arisen
under the same artistic hand that added to
the quaint old place so lovingly in consonance
; but the other, lying back to the

north-east of the dwelling, half hidden
among trees, has, Hke the abode itself, a
far-away history for the telling.

The village proper has but one wide
street, with a few diverging alleys — one
shop for diverse commodities, one school
which flourishes under the winof of the
church ; which church, with its oddly-shaped
spire, stands as a landmark within
a green churchyard, on the top of a broad
knoll in the rear of the Oaklandss ; the
one solitary spot of rising ground in the
rich, if somewhat level landscape. The
cosy vicarage looks out on its own beds of
old-fashioned, sweet-scented flowers, and
on wide-spreading market-gardens which
flourished all around.

It was otherwise in 1740, when Elizabeth
Coppock, the former owner of the Oak-lands,
having died a spinster, her executors,
John Coppock, of Timperley, a tanner, and
Esther Leicester, widow, the brother and
sister of the deceased, disposed of the house
and lands to Thomas Venables, of Prest-bury,
gentleman, a widower with a long

pedigree and one child, a fair-haired
maiden of seventeen, ^vhose name was
Sybil.

At that period the country roads hereabouts
were little better than cart tracks,
the lanes mere packhorse or bridle-paths ;
the hall, the farm, the tannery, and a few
cottages represented the village ; the nearest
market was at Altringham,* more than
two miles away ; the nearest church at
Bowdon, a like distance ; and the road
which came direct through the village from
Baguley Moor, was crossed by Fairy Well
Brook before it reached the Oaklandss or
Timperley Hall, and again by Timperley
Brook ere it branched off right and left in
an acute angle to Altringham^ and Bowdon.
There was no canal then even projected
for Altringham, the bridges were unbuilt,
and whoso would pass over a stream must
ford it as best mio^ht be. But use is second
nature ; the peasantry would go fearlessly
through the water barefooted or shod with
thick wooden-soled clogs ; and even dainty

• Now spelled Altrincham.

misses would tuck up their skirts and trip
across the slippery stepping-stones on their
way to church or market.

Then, too, the lands and the homesteads
thereon were mostly in the hands of gentlemen
or of yeomen, who cultivated their
own grounds from father to son ; and
though the tatler, John Coppock, was a
man of substance, and his wife disputed
precedence with the Widow Leicester in the
church porch, they both made way for the
wives and daughters of acknowledged
gentry with becoming reverence.

With a difference — that is. Mrs Leicester
had a snug cottage and an income of her
own, had buried the trade which had provided
both, along with her dead husband,
and having no occupation but the cares of
her widowhood, on the strength of his
name claimed for her dead husband some
sort of affinity with Sir Peter Leicester's
family, and held her head somewhat high.

Mr Venables had certainly bought the
Oaklandss at a very low figure ; and it was
said that had not Mistress Leicester's voice

outweighed that of her brother in striking
the bargain for her dead sister's property,
he would not have obtained possession so
cheaply. And it was hinted by her sister-in-law,
in the privacy of the tannery house-place,
that the widow had shown favour
to the widower, who was "a personable
man and a gentleman," with the ulterior
object of quitting her white-washed cottage
for the Oaklandss, and so taking precedence
of her, Joan Coppock, at once and
for ever.

But whether Mr Thomas Venables was
obtuse, or Mistress Leicester did not take
his fancy, or he was content with his state
of widowhood, or she had no such views,
the result was the same. He came and
went many times before the purchase
was fully completed, but he evinced no
disposition to give the place any mistress
but his daughter Sybil.

She had lost her mother quite two years,
but her father had not cast his mourning
suit ; indeed, he was quitting Prestbury for
Timperley partly to rid himself of old

associations and painful memories. Leavings
behind the old church wherein the
public benefactions of his immediate ancestors
were recorded, and where his own
good wife lay buried.

There were censorious persons who said
that his wife had been a soft creature,
crushed under his arbitrary rule ; and that
remorse, not aching affection, had driven
him to let his paternal estate to strangers
and make a home for himself elsewhere.

However this might be, he set no bounds
to his love for her child, the one only
blossom of their married life ; and it might
be that there was some truth in the rumour
that as one covers up a honeypot from the
flies, so he had removed his sweet Sybil
from rash admirers in Prestbury, lest he
should lose her also.

Only the one ! Only the one ! " had
been the cry of the married pair whensoever
Illness dimmed the blue eyes of their
darling ; " Only the one ! " had been the
excuse when sterner fathers or mothers
blamed them for overmuch indulgence of

the girl God had given ; for family discipline
in those days was something rigid
and awe-inspiring, and woful things were
predicted if the cherished Sybil was allowed
to have so much of her own way.
And as she grew up tall and graceful, and
beautiful and winning with the growing
years, the parents were content, and only
loved her the more as they made little concessions
to her fancies or her inclinations.
Not so much Mrs Venables as her lord, who
rejoiced to see in Sybil a shadowing forth
of his own resolute and determined will.

A true Venables is Sybil ! " he cried,
none of your puny weaklings without a
will of their own."

And the mother quietly acquiesced, well-content
that it should be so, having a
notion that she herself would have fared
none the worse had her own self-reliance
and determination been a trifle stronger.

But with the true Venables' spirit and
strength of will, Sybil had inherited the
clinging, sympathetic, affectionate nature
of her mother also, and by this she won

her way Into the hearts of others — and
others into hers. And when her mother's
faint health threw the burden of household
cares on younger shoulders, it was
the union of these qualities that enabled
her to control even those old servants most
inclined to resist her delegated authority.

Certainly it was admitted in the servants'
quarters, even by bent and wrinkled old
Josh, who had been groom and gardener
when the master was a boy, and by waddling
Ursula, who ruled the roast and kept
the maids in order, that young Mistress
Sybil was not ill-qualified to govern.
There had been controversy on the point,
and some show of rebellion at first, but in
assembled conclave so much was deliberately,
if reluctantly, conceded.

They were quite right ; she was not ill-qualified.


Her mother's indulgence had not comprehended
luxurious idleness. The distant
boarding-schools of the period had not been
thought of for the maiden. Teachers had
been found nearer to their own door ; and

the gentle mother herself, well skilled in
home-accomplishments, had kept her young
fingers busy, on the principle that

Satan finds some mischief still,
For idle hands to do."

She could not only use her sewing-needle
well, but she could make wines and
confections, clear starch the kerchiefs and
ruffles of father and mother, knit mittens
and hose, embroider cushions and covers
in tent stitch, lull her sire to sleep with the
music of her spinet, and, thanks to the
instruction of the vicar, she could write a
letter in a fair round-hand and tolerable
English, and keep the domestic accounts
with a clearness and accuracy by no means
common in that day and generation, even
amongst gentlewomen.

A mere child when her father first set
her on horseback, she learned to ride alone
(without a pillion and supporter), a fearless
horsewoman regardless of rough roads.

But Sybil's chief accomplishment was
spinning. Not that spinning was deemed

a mere accomplishment. From the fireside
of the cotter or the farmer, to the halls
of the landed gentry, spinning was yet considered
part of a woman's daily occupation ;
and the country damsel who had not spun
the linen for her future use and home, was
regarded as an thrift, and scarcely
worthy to marry. But Sybil's dainty
touch had converted the common art into
an accomplishment, and the even fineness
of her thread was discussed, and commended
on many a hearth as an exemplar
for other maidens.

It must be remembered that there was
no Muche in those days to send relays of
novels in boxes by the carrier, the books
on Mr Venables' shelves were not altogether
inviting, and winter evenings were
illuminated only by candles, so that knitting
or spinning, which required little light,
and did not interfere with conversation or
meditation, was congenial employment for
feminine finders.

Whatever motive urged the widower to
quit Prestbury for Timperley, Sybil's

fame must have preceded her. When she
and her father on a chilly morning in
spring alighted from their horses at the
Oaklandss, and found Mrs Leicester waiting
in the porch to surrender the keys and
show the young lady over the house,
which she saw for the first time, and which
the widow had effusively volunteered to
air for their reception, the obsequious
dame's salutations proclaimed it.

"Welcome to the Oaklandss, sir ! Welcome
to your new home, Miss Venables !
and, meaning no offence, I would say I'm
proud my sister Bess is like to have so
gradely a successor in the old place."

Sybil's face was shadowed by her
riding-hat, but she raised her head and her
eyelids somewhat as she adjusted her disordered
skirts, and their questioning was
as clear as her father's audible " How so,
good dame ? "

Well, sir," and the " good dame " kept
a watchful eye on the young face under the
black beaver's broad brim as she led the
way through a small queerly-shaped 

and other passages to a wider
apartment already provided with a table
and chairs, and an appetising repast for
the travellers by their attentive cicerone, —
"Well, sir," she repeated, "my dead and
gone sister, Bess Coppock, was counted
the finest wool-spinner in these parts ; and
I've been given to understand the young
mistress here is a match for the best
spinner in all Cheshire," and the same
furtive look went towards the fair face
under the beaver's brim.

Ay, so 'tis said," was the complacent
answer of the well-pleased father. " But
'tis overtaking to flatter young maidens so
openly. You have brought blushes into
her cheeks already."

Ay ! but it is none for the flattery she
is blushing, food lack ! I warrant miss
guesses where I got to hear of her fine
spinning," was the sly thought of the
knowing widow. Her open reply was, —
"Nay, it's more like the keen March wind.
I hope it's given Miss Venables an appetite
as well as a colour."

Right, Mrs Leicester, there's nothing
like a brisk ride on a cold morning to paint
cheeks and sharpen appetites. The refreshments
your civility has provided will
be welcome, and I thank you for both of
us, since Sybil seems too shy." And,
hanofine his three-cornered hat on a knob
of the chair's high back, he took his seat
at the table with the ease of a man in his
own house, to whom such attention was
due, and made a sign for Sybil to do the
same.

She had removed her travelling cloak or
cardinal, but not her hat, and had thanked
the widow before she took her seat ; but it
was with an air of reserve, which protested
against a stranger's familiar observations
and attention, rather than the gracious
acceptance of courtesy.

Meanwhile Mrs Leicester had so much
to say for the pastry and the home-brewed,
the honey, the cheese, and the wheaten
bread, all of which were pressed upon them
as due to her own skill, or that of her "dead
sister, Bess Coppock," that soon Mr Enables

became as weary of her fussy attendance
as his daughter. The hasty luncheon
over, Sybil rose to inspect her new home,
the widow volunteering her services as
guide, while Mr Venables went out to inspect
the stables.

She knew every nook and corner of the
old place, she said, though she never thought
it would be her duty to hand it over to a
stranger, and again she launched out into
praise of her dead sister, and encomiums
of her living successor as a wool-spinner.

You are mistaken, Mrs Leicester. I
am not much of a wool-spinner. I have
principally spun flax," was the somewhat
distant acknowledgment of Miss Enables,
as she hastened to follow her guide o\"er
the curious and intricate abode, before the
was^^ons laden with their goods and chattels
should arrive.

Well now, only to think of that ! " exclaimed
the other, as they turned midway
the sharp angle of the oaken staircase.
And there, I wouldn't let John Coppock
or his wife disturb sister's wheel. I said

they might make away with the maid's
wheel in the house-place if they liked, but
I told them that maybe Mr Venables
daughter miorht choose Bess's room for
her own, seeing that it had two doors, and
was handy for keeping the lazy servant
lasses in order, being nigh both the front
stairs and the back.'

Oh, is it?" interjected Sybil, with justa
faint show of interest, and scarcely a
second balance at the arose wheel left asa
fixture against the wall.

"Ay, and I said you might be glad to find
a good wheel set up ready to your hand, for
all the folk about here spin wool, mostly
for the Manchester weavers, an' I'll warrant
there's no better wheel i' all Timperley.
A rare lot of fine yarn did Bess spin with
it ; and a vast lot of fine hose and kersey
did Hugh Furnival get from his aunt, for
she was a knitter as well as a spinner, miss;
and there's a weaver nigh at hand on the
moor, should you happen to want one."

Sybil had listened idly whilst taking a
critical survey of the apartment or apartments,

mentally resolving, for various
reasons, to take the hint given, and make
them her own ; but as Hugh Furnival's
name fell from the widow's lips there was
the slightest possible start, and her colour
visibly changed. She turned to a window
to hide it, but not before the watchful Mrs
Leicester had seen all she wanted, unobservant
as she appeared.

The latter went on, without waiting fora
response, " Well, to be sure, I thought
the wheel would be just the thing for you,
and sing as merry a tune to your turning
as it did to our Bess. And, after all,
I reckon you won't want the wheel ? "

This last was half an interrogation, and
she looked more than a little disconcerted
by Sybil's lack of appreciation.

So perceptible was this that the young
lady, having regained her own composure,
came to her relief and said, without turning,
Thank you, Mrs Leicester, for your good
intent. The wheel can be left where it is,
at least for the present. Perhaps I may try
my hand at wool occasionally for a change.

VOL. I. B

It would be ungrateful to neMect such a
thoughtful provision. I will mention it to
my father. But here come the pains. We
must complete our survey quickly."

And without another word, or a token
of interest in Hugh Furnival, Bess Cop-rock's
nephew, or the hose spun and
knitted for his use, she passed through the
opposite door, and from room to room,
looking into cupboards and presses by
the way, and went down the retired back
staircase to the house-place and kitchen,
in advance of the loquacious Mrs Leicester.

The servants had come aloncr with the
heavily-loaded waggons ; Josh on horseback
with a maid on a pillion behind him,
whilst fat Mrs Ursula and another woman
were softly seated on the feather-beds at
the back of the last waggon. Soon all
was bustle and excitement ; Mrs Leicester,
quite unsolicited, hurrying hither and
thither, proffering her services as guide to
the premises with rather more zeal than
discretion.

Ere long the grave gentleman in black

raised his three-cornered hat and said,
"Many thanks, Mrs Leicester, but you
need not trouble. My daughter can direct
the men and maids. I leave all domestic
arrangements to her." And Sybil herself
hinted later on that she was not wanted,
by saying, " Our old servants are shy of
strangers."

She had had enough of Mrs Leicester,
and Mrs Leicester saw it.

She trudged home through the green
lane, shaking her head as she went, and
muttering to herself, "If Hugh Furnival
is good enough for the company of
miss, surely Hugh's aunt might be; and
for all some folk hold their heads so high,
pride may have a come-down some day.
And what can a chit of a girl know of
household management ? I should like to
know ! "

She had frequent opportunities to learn,
for on any excuse or no excuse, Mrs
Leicester obtruded her society and services
at the Oaklandss, most anxious lest
Mr Venables or his household should lack

anything at the hands of Sybllla, that her
more mature experience could supply.

But Sybil Venables had already proved
her capacity for reigning alone. If she
could spin a fine thread with a dainty
hand, she could rule the domestics with a
firm one ; and her pride did not comedown
readily to familiar intercourse with vulgar
Mrs Leicester, whatever might be her
relations with the encroaching widow's
nephew.

Still less did the new master of the Oak-lands,
who wrote himself down " Thomas
Venables, Gentleman," feel disposed to
accept favours or familiarity from the
tanner's sister. And had he known of
any relationship existing between the
Coppock family and Hugh Furnival, he
would have closed his doors against her
entrance.

THE FATHER AND THE LOVER.

jO to your wheel, girl, and let me
hear no more of Hugh Fur-rival
! " had been the command
of Thomas Venables to his
daughter six months before she dismounted
at the Oaklandss ; "and, prithee,
think no more of wedlock until a worthier
man comes a- wooing to thee — a gentleman
and no Jacobite ! "

I am afraid, sir," she answered, '* you
are blinded by prejudice. It is not right
to judge of a man's worth by his politics
or by his position."

You are of no age to judge what is

right, Sybil, and I am not wont to brook
reply. Go to your wheel, and learn patience
and docility therefrom."

Thus dismissed, after a sharp lecture,
she had gone to her wheel, but the thread
she spun was neither so even nor so fine
as usual. Her father's tone had been unwontedly
harsh and severe ; there was
neither patience nor obedience at her
finger-tips ; and there was something which
miofht become rebellion in her heart.

He is worthy as I — and I love him,"
was all she could say or think, and the
wheel took it up like an echo, and went
round and round to the tune.

And now let us look on this Hugh Carnival,
who had furnished " Thomas Venables,
Gentleman," with a crowning motive for
uprooting his house-tree and planting it
elsewhere ; a motive so strong as to bar
the door against all who were of the young
man's kith and kin. Was he so notoriously
a black sheep .'*

His own father did not think so ; the new
vicar did not think so ; and if he had not

watched the farmer's son grow from boyhood
to manhood, his predecessor had
voluntarily led the youth through the
intricacies of Greek and Latin, and the
Rev. Joseph Ward found him an intelligent
companion where such companions were
few. The squires and farmers round about
Prestbury said freely enough that he had
been educated beyond the need or the
general run of farmers' sons, and that
Farmer Furnival would rue it ; but he
only laughed and said, Hugh had as much
right to learning as had the two sons of
his cousin Coppock, the Manchester tailor,
both of whom had gone straight from the
Manchester Grammar School to college,
and taken honours there.

Hugh Furnival had a well-knit frame,
stood five-feet ten in his stocking-feet,
wore neither powder nor periwig, perhaps
not so much because they were unsuited
to his condition, as because he knew his
own chesnut curls were a better setting for
his handsome face, and matched his dark
brown eyes, so full of fire and feeling.

Then, never a squire in the county was a
better shot, or could ride to hounds against
him ; and where was the countryman who
could throw him at a wrestling-bout, or
keep an unbroken crown when he had the
handling of a quarter-staff? And if he
did aspire to wear gold-lace on his best
three-cornered hat, there was none on his
deep-flapped, buff waistcoat, or on his long-skirted
coat, and only on Sundays did he
buckle his breeches' knees and his shoes
with silver instead of steel. Yet his father
said he looked " as fine a fellow as ever
stepped across a farm — or won a girl's
heart."

Reasons these perchance for the blushes
and prepossession of Miss Sybil, but
scarcely for the prejudice of Mr Venables
against Hugh's very kith and kin, or for
his assertion that he was " unworthy."

Yet the gentleman was not a man of
rash judgment ; and had the damsel shown
no tendency to blush at Hugh's approach,
Thomas Venables might have regarded
him as a passable young fellow, a likely

successor to his father on the Spring-Holm
Farm, and not have troubled himself about
either his property, his pedigree, or his
politics, not being given to meddle in what
did not concern him.

But no sooner did a rumour reach him
that " the fine young fellow " had been
observed to visit the new vicar on the days
Miss Venables went to the old-fashioned
parsonage for instruction, than he put a
sudden stop to the lessons, on a plea that
she had " learning enough for a woman,"
and was wanted indoors now her mother
was gone.

It was no new things to see the son of
Farmer Furnival uncovered in the ivy-clad
church porch when they and the other
gentry passed out into the ancient graveyard,
or for himself and daughter to
acknowledge the customary deference with
becoming courtesy. But it was new to
observe glances cross, and faces flush, as
civilities were exchanged, and to catch the
echo of a whispered word in passing.

At once the gentleman drew his daughter's

listened arm within his own, and held it
there, as if he felt another hand was waiting
to pluck it forth and bear her away ; his
brows contracted, and he flung at the presumptuous
young farmer a look of haughty
indignation, that said, with never a word
spoken, " How dare you ?"

And, as if in answer to a challenge, the
younger eyes shot back their bold " I dare ! "

Being taken to task, Sybil admitted
that HuQfh Furnival had been wont to
carry home her books from the vicar's and
from church, when she was otherwise
unattended ; that he had now and again
brought her posies from Spring-Holm ;
and that once they had strayed for half-an-hour
alonpf the winding banks of the River
Bollin ; but she would not admit that he
was an improper associate for her father's
child, even though she heard him stigmatised
as a " lowborn lout" and a "traitorous
Jacobite."

Scarcely reasons these to move a maiden
of seventeen over whom the love of a
handsome man had cast a glamour. Yet

Thomas Venables weighted them with his
will, and expected them to serve her and
the lover also into whose teeth he flung
them discourteously two days later as an
answer to his suit.

Nor did the vicar fare better when he
essayed to put in a word for the young
people.

The Furnivals are rank Jacobites, sir!
The whole family, root and branch ! " was
the irate answer. " Would you have me
fling my precious Sybil away on a plotting
Jacobite, who may be hatching treason
even now ? Would you have me fling the
girl's fortune into the Pretender's pouch ^
And there it would go if it got into Hugh
Furnival's fingers, if he did not fling it
into the gutter beforehand. Let him turn
to the plough and marry the dairymaid,
like his grandfather before him, instead of
racing after the hounds as if he had gentle
blood in his veins, or seeking a mate above
his degree."

Consider his education," urged the
reverend gentleman mildly.

Consider what ? The art of agriculture
is education for a farmer, sir ! What have
Greek and Latin done for Hugh Furnival
but teach him to despise the honest industry
of his parents, and set him agog
to wield a sword — another Hector or
Achilles. Say no more, sir. I can have no
fellowship with upstart coxcombs, nor with
Jacobites. Say no more, or I may suspect
you to be tarred with the same brush."

The vicar, possibly conscience smitten,
drew a quick breath, but said never a word
more for the rejected suitor. It was dangerous
even to be suspected, so bitter was
the feeling of the time, so sharp the treatment
of convicted Jacobites, as the adherents
of James Stuart, the Pretender,
were opprobriously called by the upholders
of the House of Hanover and its representative,
George the Second.

It was after this conversation with the
vicar, which had somehow reached the
ears of Sybil, that she ventured a remonstrance
with her sire, to be answered in
the words with which this chapter opens.

And it having reached his ears that
Hugh Furnival haunted the green lanes
of Prestbury, and met his treasured Sybil
in spite of his interdict, he decided on
doing promptly that which he had contemplated
from the sad time of his wife's
death.

He took all precaution to keep the
whereabouts of his new estate secret, even
riding ahead of the laden waggons as a
guide, with Sybil beside him. But he
overlooked the necessity for hiring other
waggons to supplement his own, and forgot
that the drivers went back to their
respective farms with the news. And he
had made the mistake of pitching his tent
too near the old encampment ; and though
defective roads, and want of roads, might
double the distance between Prestbury
and Timperley, what were eight or nine
miles to one who could ride his horse
bare-backed over hedge or ditch almost as
the crow flies, when his spurs were love
and exasperation.

To Sybil, whose uneasy mind had

magnified the unknown miles they travelled
so slowly, this removal seemed like
transportation. She could only think of
Hugh and his despair on finding that she
had been spirited away ; and, mingled
with thoughts of Hugh, came bitter condemnation
of her father's " cruelty " in
severing them.

And as if aware of all that was working
in the girl's mind like yeast, Thomas Enables
strove to chase the shadows by
cheerful allusions to their new home, and
all he meant to do to make it pleasant.

He described to her the many-gabled
house, the well-wooded lands, the winding
water overhung with alder and willow,
over which he proposed to throw a bridge
for communication with the meadow
and pasture beyond, of the great oaks
which gave their name to the place, of the
garden for her flowers, and that for kitchen
produce, of the stables, the dairy, and all
that could be supposed to interest a young
housekeeper.

Then he spoke of neighbours at the

Halls of Timperley and Baguley, Ridding
and Wythenshaw, of guests to be invited
to a hospitable hearth, where she was to
preside as queen ; but he scarcely won her
from her own unpleasant reflections on
that forced separation from Hugh ; and
though she listened, it was with a spirit of
resentment rather that satisfaction.

Mrs Leicester unquestionably startled
her. But she thought the woman vulgar
and intrusive, and it was not until afterwards
that she learned to tolerate her as a
livings link between herself and distant
Hugh. She was scarcely conscious how
much the familiar mention of his name,
and the knowledge that he had relations
so close at hand, served to soften her
harsh judgment of her really kind father,
and contributed to the interest she took in
the painting and stenciling, the arrangement
of draperies, china, glass, and
pictures ; especially in the rooms which
had been given up to her on request.

Pleased with her activity, glad to show
that fatherly affection had alone been his

prompter, he had acquiesced readily enough,
though a single apartment had served her
hitherto.

Well, well, Sybil, if you prefer it to
a sitting-room downstairs for your own
work or study, when my company or that
of my friends is undesirable " (a needful
provision when to "drink deep " was the
privilege of a gentlemen), " I am content,
so long as you do not indulge in melancholy.
But you will need more furniture for
the room than the old spinster's wheel.
How persistent Mrs Leicester was in
pressing the wheel upon us as a gift, as
though I could possibly accept such a
favour from a mere stranger, and an
inferior. The woman is well-meaning, no
doubt ; but she is ill-bred, and mistakes
her own position."

So I thought, sir, at first ; but I fancy
she only means to be civil and obliging,
and I like her better than I did ; " and
Sybil proceeded with her arrangement
of china punch-bowls and silver drinking-cups
on the oaken buffet in the diningroom

in silence, mentally asking herself
whether she could have tolerated Mrs
Leicester, apart from her association with
Hugh Furnival ?

Mr Venables was too reserved and
proud to dine in the common hall with his
servants at the same board as his predecessor
at the Oaklandss had done, and as
had been the wont with his own forefathers
at Prestbury. Indeed, the custom was still
so general that he was looked upon as an
innovator, and his " pride " contemned accordingly.


They had been some seven weeks in
Timperley, and Sybil had begun to fancy
her father had forgotten his promise ; the
last paint brush had done its work ; his
few fine pictures had found places on the
panelled walls ; his books — classical, historical,
and controversial — were on their
shelves ; the great clock had been set
going in the hall ; the servants' quarters
were in order likewise ; every pewter
dish and platter was freshly polished, and
in its place ; every wooden trencher scrub-vol.
I. c

bed white and in array ; the oaken settle
shone as brightly in the house-place as the
chairs and tables in the dining-room and
parlour ; the servants had gone to bed
(along with the sun), and Sybil was
saying " Good-night " to her father at the
head of the front staircase, when he held
her hand for a moment, and, with a smile,
said, —

Busk yourself for a ride in the morning,
Sybil. You know that Tuesday is the
Altringham market-day, and as it bids fair
to be fine, I intend you to accompany me to
select the furniture for your private sitting-room.
Josh will have the horses at the
door by the time breakfast is over."

Sybil's eyes had been heavy of late,
but they brightened as she thanked him ;
and seeing that she was pleased, the stern
man, from whom such signs of affection
were rare, pressed a kiss upon her brow,
smoothed a hand over her falling hair, and
murmured " God bless thee ! " A spontaneous
outburst of repressed emotion,
saying much for the inner feelings of the

father, at a period when it was not considered
seemly to display parental attachment
openly. It was supposed that familiarity
with a child led to contempt and disobedience.


He turned into his chamber, well satisfied
and content, in that she was pleased.
She passed on to her own room softened
and elate, and stood looking out of the
window, whilst the shadow deepened over
the landscape, in a better frame of mind
than had been hers for many a day.

Her father's caress had been more to her
than the promise he had made, and that
held elements of delightful anticipation.

What young lady would not have been
gratified by such marks of kindness even
in these days when parents concede so
much to their offspring, and varying
fashion clamours for frequent changes.
Then, the furniture of one generation was
handed down to the next, to be again transmitted,
and this entirely new fitting up for
her sole use was an event indeed.

Ay, an event on which hung events

6 Sybil.

unforeseen either by father or daughter, or
neither would have sat down to breakfast
so serenely.

Josh had the horses groomed and in
readiness ; Ursula stood in the porch to
receive the last orders of her young mistress,
and to assist in the modest adjustment
of her small riding-hoop, which projected
over the hips like a pair of panniers,
with no lower frame-work ; and she having
drawn her black silk mantua closer round
her shoulders, rode off beside her father,
with as sunny a smile under the brim of
the flat hat she wore tied down over her
ears as he himself could wish.

He had unbuttoned two flaps of his
three-cornered hat, to shield his eyes from
the sun, and from under the brim he
watched every change of her speaking
countenance, proud of her grace and beauty,
glad for her gladness, and rejoicing in the
success of his scheme to blot her unsuitable
lover from her memory ; and he smiled
upon her in his grave manner as he gazed.

INIrs Leicester's cottage lay on their

route just where the road branched off to
Altringham and Bowdon. It was a veritable
bower of honeysuckle and roses ; and,
before they reached the low wooden gate,
they saw the dame by the side of her beehives,
hooped and hooded as if equipped
for a walk, but apparently watching her
bees as they went and came industriously,
dived into the nectary of a flower, or
brushed the pollen from their coats to fill
their little pockets — and it might be, her
big ones.

Come, Sally, lass, how long don't mean
to be ? " called in no measured tones, told
that she was simply waiting for a stout
serving woman, in a blue linen overgrown
and petticoat, who made her appearance
with a huQ^e wicker-basket on her arm.

The muffled beat of hoofs on the dusty
road had not been heard until they were
all close to the garden gate, where they
made a pause, and she seemed well-pleased
to street them — the master of the Oaklandss
and his daughter, who travelled with a
man-servant in their rear.

J

I am wanting some good wool. Pray
can you tell me where I can be best
served ? " asked Sybil, before they rode
away.

Well, you're off to Altringham, I reckon;
so I'll maybe meet you in the market, and
I can take you to th' wool-comber's where
Bess got hers. You'll happen put your
beasts up at th' ' Unicorn,' sir ? "

Mr Venables assented.

Well, four legs go faster than two, and
I've my markets to make when I get there,
but after noon I'm at your service, miss,
and we can keep a look-out for one another,
and maybe you'll find me ttseftcl before the
day's out."

She was thanked and they rode on,
Mr Venables remarking, affably enough, " I
think the brood dame is 
somewhat too free in her manner."
But Sybil fancied there was some hidden
meaning in her concluding words, and
wondered if they covered a rebuke or a
sarcasm.

Only for a moment did Mrs Leicester

look after them, with her brown hand shading
the peculiar expression of her grey
eyes. Then, snapping the gate behind
her, she followed at a brisk pace, regardless
of the heat, urging on her attendant.

The scene was new to Sybil, who
patted the sleek neck of her horse when
under her father's pilotage he had carried
her, uncared by the noise, in safety
through the crowd and hubbub to the stone
horse-block by the " Unicorn," a good inn
at the wider end of the triangular marketplace.
There the obedient animal's head
was held by Josh, and drawn alongside
that his mistress might alight. Gracefully
she stepped from the saddle to the stone,
and stood erect in her proud beauty.

For a moment she looked around as if
in quest of someone scarcely hoped for.
Then pressing her lips close to keep back
a sigh, she came down the steps of the
block, with a firm resolve to dismiss that
"someone" from her thoughts, and obey
the father who was doing so much to prove
his love for her.

Josh led away the horses, and she, holding
fast by her father's arm, traversed
with him the lively market - place and
made sundry purchases ; then went from
one tradesman's shop to another to order
or select furniture of the newest mode, including
curtains and a square of carpet,
and that other luxury a Venetian glass, ina
walnut-wood frame, to hang between
the windows ; all, in short, that could make
her sitting-room bright and pleasant ; the
presence of the large spinning - wheel
fastened against the wall as a coach-wheel
on an axle, not being then considered an
incongruity.

There were s^reetin^rs in the marketplace.
Cheshire is noted for its landed
gentry, its stalwart men, its good-looking
women ; but amongst them Sybil
seemed to attract peculiar attention,
whether as a stranger or for her especial
comeliness.

Yet of the many jolly squires and yeomen
who accosted Thomas Venables, he
presented but two to his daughter. These,

he told her, were neighbours. Squire
Gerard, of Riddingss, a moaned grange outside
Altringham, of which the young squire,
who had been on his travels, had recently
taken possession ; and young Tatton, of
Wyvenshaw, an historic old mansion beyond
Timperley, both of whom seemed
inclined to cultivate the acquaintance.

Many years had gone by since Mr
Venables had attended a market encumbered
with a female ; his wife had
been a stay-at-home, and he found his
daughter somewhat of a charge, as well
as a fetter on his own free movements,
proud as he was of the attention she
attracted.

He appeared no little relieved when
after luncheon he espied Mrs Leicester
from one of the windows of the " Unicorn,"
as she came bustling up, as fast asher
inflated hoop would allow. Very
gladly did he then resign Sybil to
her care, whilst he went about business
of his own.

I ween he would have left his own

Sybil.

business undone could he have had an
inkling of Mrs Leicester's business.

Surely enough she led Miss Venables to
the wool-comber's, and helped her to choose
and bargain for her wool, as she had
promised.

And as surely, there too, was found a

fine

young

farmer, with fleeces for the

wool-comber, and the young farmer was
Hush Furnival.

o

SYBILLAS SUITORS.

iYBILLA had eaten her luncheon
at the " Unicorn " in the best of
spirits, and although somewhat
abashed by the attentions of
Squire Gerard, who had accompanied them
thither, she could think only of her father's
lavish outlay for her gratification, and of
her own grateful duty towards him.

Overpowered by his affectionate generosity,
taken too by surprise, she was
brimming over with dutiful affection and
wise resolves to brine her own will into
subjection to her good and loving father's
in the one matter wherein they were at

variance, and sat in the window seat with
her elbow on the ledge and her cheek upon
her palm, deciding that she would see
Hugh Furnival no more — when, alas! for
her resolution, Mrs Leicester came in sight,
broke the thread of thought, and carried
her away.

Innocently and unsuspiciously she entered
the wool-comber's. Their talk by
the way had been of the market prices of
wool and flax, and such matters. When
Mrs Leicester opened the half-door (the
upper half was hooked to the low ceiling),
she walked as it were into a trap. She
saw only the dealer in wool, and with the
aid of her guide made her purchase, and
had turned to ^o when HuQ^h's handsome
face met hers.

There was a conflict between love and
filial obedience, a special pleader within to
second the eloquent eyes and low-toned
voice of Hugh, as he urged that he should
grow reckless and rush to destruction If
she abandoned him, promising to wait
patiently until her father withdrew his

interdict, if she would only meet him now
and again to keep hope alive — meet him
at his aunt Leicester's.

And surely there can be no harm in
that, miss," put in the wily feminine matchmaker,
whose sharp ears had been on the
alert.

No harm in deceiving my father ? "
murmured Villa, shrinking back.

"It would only be for a time, sweet one ;
he loves you too well to withhold consent
for ever."

Ah, yes, he doth love me well ; but — "
only a sigh finished the speech, and, if her
hand was in his warm clasp, her eyes
sought the ground, afraid to look up into
his beseeching ones.

"You cannot wish to break my heart ?"
whispered Hugh, bending near to her.
Separation is worse than death to me ; I
cannot live without a word or sight of you,
my dearest one. You will kill me with denial.
If you love me do not say me nay.'

And with such pleading, in tones meant
for her ear and heart alone, she was won

over, Mrs Leicester keeping the wool-comber
discreetly apart, bundling up the
wool for convenience of carriage the
while.

Sybil had entered the low shop fearless
and free. She left it fettered with stronger
bonds and burthened with a secret, and a
sense of treachery towards the father who
had only that very day loaded her with
favours.

The homeward ride late in the afternoon
had none of the morning's cheeriness.
Grey masses of cloud seemed to rise up
behind and follow them, and their steeds
being turned towards the west, the setting
sun sent a crimson glare into their faces
from between long bars of purple and
black. There was scarcely a twitter from
the trees or hedge-rows ; now and then
was heard a faint cricket-like chirp, but
whether from the golden-crested wren or
the lively insect, it could not be distinguished
for the beat of hoofs. Either a
black-cap or a nightingale hushed its evensong
on their approach, but the air was

close and still, and the leaves had scarce a
quiver. A ghost-moth from the meadows
flew across their track, and now and then
a brimstone-moth fluttered about, as if
waking for the night. But Sybil noted
none of these. She was lively and depressed
by fits, and sat her horse somewhat
wearily.

Thou art over-tired, Sybil, lass. It
has been an exciting day for thee," remarked
her father kindly, attributing her
long stretch of silence to fatigue.

A sigh accompanied the faint " Ay,
father," of her assent.

Ah," said he, " the air is close and
oppressive. I think we are threatened with
a storm. It is well we are nigh at home."

They were at home ; and Sybil, pleading
" fatigue " (the suggestion of her father),
had retired to rest after their early supper,
before the elemental storm burst over
Timperley ; but another storm threatened,
which might be longer in gathering, yet
would be far more scathing and destructive
to the inmates of the Oaklandss.

Sybil had retired to her room, but not
to rest. She paced the floor in unwonted
agitation. She had given a promise to
Huo;h in defiance of her father's will and
open interdict. And she could no longer
justify her disobedience with the pretext of
parental cruelty. Had she not found him
most kind and indulgent in all but where
Hugh Furnival was concerned. She knew
she had done wrong, and had not strength
of mind or will to right it.

The storm without seemed to mock the
tumult in her breast. She shrank from the
blinding lightning flashes, and huddled on
a chair, covered up her head to shut them
out, with a sort of fear that the angry voice
of God was thundering: to her.

But she never threw herself upon her
knees to beseech pardon, or to ask for
guidance, or to be delivered from temptation
; and morning found her little more
composed.

At the breakfast-table the next mornings
her customary platter of oatmeal-porridge
and bowl of new milk went away almost

untasted. She drank the coffee, which
was there as a luxury, Hke one who feels
the need of a refreshing draught ; but
rejected alike the hung beef and the brawn
with which her father heartily supplemented
his porridge.

"What ails thee, Sybil ?" cried Thomas
Venables at length ; " squeamish appetites
are not for healthy country maidens, and
thought pecking like a bird," and he looked
across at her with much concern.

The storm kept me awake last night ;
and I have a headache," was her excuse ;
but it was not made without hesitation or
change of countenance, for though the
headache was real enough, the plea was
not, and she was new at deception.

"Then give thy orders to the maids, Syb,
and come out of doors with me. The fresh
air will do thee good, and thou canst tell
me how thou wouldst have thy garden laid
out. It was all very well for a thrifty
farmer like spinster Coppock to turn every
rod of land to account, and plant nothing
thereon but what would serve for the pot

VOL. I. D

or the market. But a young lady of fair
estate and good breeding must have her
sweet-smelling posies, her stocks and her
cauliflowers, her roses and lilies, her lawn
and summer-bower, her shady walk when
the sun is hot, and evergreens to cheat
winter of its gloom. Is it not so, Syb ? "

Sybil was reaching her garden hat
from the antlers in the hall, and he saw
not her face as she answered, " Ay, father,
ay," with something rising in her throat,
as if to choke her.

I will join you directly in the courtyard,
when I have spoken to Ursula," she
said, turning into the house-place or
servants' hall, whilst he passed out at a
door, near the back stairs, to the courtyard
in the rear.

She found him in the garden with Josh,
who was lamenting the overgrowth of
weeds, and explaining the necessity for
employing a younger back than his own
or that of his assistant, to stoop and grub
them up.

There's a sharp little chap hanging

about th' gate now, as 'ud be glad o' th'
job, master ; an' he'd be downreet weel
paid wi' a penny an' some o' them parties
you're groin' to lev dug up to mak' th'
lawn, they'd half o' them goo to th' pigs."

Who is the lad ? " asked Mr Venables.

Who, he says as his feather's a waiver,
an' lives o' th' Moor, an' they're nigh
chemin', for he donna' get warps enow
for his loom sin' Bess Coppock died. Yo'
see, mester, there bent spinners enow
to keep th' wavers a-going', nether here
nor i' Manchester ; and if they canna' get
th' woo' they canna' work."

Sybil, standing by her father's side,
had heard Josh's adroit plea to serve the
lad and save his own back at the same
time ; and shocked at the word " clem-min',
" wondered that her father should
hesitate a moment between feeding the
pigs with the spare potatoes and a family.
Potatoes had not come to be reckoned the
porker's proper food — parings and refuse
only fell to their share ; to give them more
would be deemed waste.

^^-^

As she said so, she added, " There may
soon be work for the weaver if I and the
maids are industrious."

Right, Syb," answered her father ;
right ! Encourage industry, and pay well
for work done ; but don't encourage idleness
with too much charity. Call the lad
in, Josh, and if he be willing to work, he
shall be paid both with pence and potatoes.
Neither we nor the hours will miss them."

o

A barefooted, ragged urchin, not more
than eight years old, whose hair was
bleached by hapless exposure to the sun,
and whose cheeks told their own tale of
short commons, answered the sharp " Hi,
thee ! " of Josh, and the beckoning wave
of his arm.

He was a little fellow to be set to work,
but he seemed glad enough of the chance ;
he shrank from the hard questioning of Mr
Venables, but when Sybil sent him to
Ursula for a breakfast of brown bread and
buttermilk, with a pitiful smile on her face,
he thought her little less than an cano-el.

And when, after a hard day's weeding,

Billy Barnes went home, with as many-new
potatoes as he could carry, and the
young lady compassionately added a silver
groat to the penny he had earned, and
sent a promise of future work for the
father, he could only describe her as " like
an angel out o' church winder."

But he had his day's weeding before
him when Thomas Venables led his
daughter over the o-rounds, still wet with
the late rainfall, noting what improvements
he designed, and — marvel for him — seeking
her opinion thereon. They had
reached the pea and potato plot, lying
between the side of the house and the
water, and had decided on the space to be
converted into a grassy lawn or bowling-green,
and then he turned, saying, —

And now, Sybil, whereabouts should
we have the bridge ? It micrht save thee
wetting thy feet in crossing to thy flower
garden and the meadow beyond, and I fear
the stepping-stones are slippery and unsafe
for thee. The heavy storm has laid them
under water now."

At every step fresh proofs of his desire
to beautify the Oaklandss for her had been
apparent ; and this last token of thoughtful
care in the parent she had been led to
regard as arbitrary and severe, was more
than she could bear, and conscience became
urgent.

Two minutes more and she would have
made confession of her error. Ah, how
often a life's destiny hangs on one moment,
one unspoken word !

Her father's " Hill! who's here ?" arrested
the words ere they reached her lips,
and they were never so ready again.

Squire Gerard, who had come riding
down Wood Lane at a trot, stopped his
horse at the gate, doffed his gold-laced
hat, and bowed low in salutation.

He was hospitably invited to enter. His
apologies for splashes contracted in the
muddy lanes and turbid streams were
accepted.

Josh called an underling to take charge
of the gentleman's horse, and soon the
master of Riddingss was seated at a table

covered with grass-bleached damask of
Sybil's own spinning, evidently thinking
more of the graceful hostess than of the
game-pie, or capon, or Cheshire cheese, or
the well-filled silver tankards, or any other
adjunct of that early luncheon.

Then followed a stroll through the
grounds v/ith Sybil in company. He
listened to his host's detail of intended
improvements ; had something to say of
the land, and the crops it would bear ;
suggested a line of shrubbery on the far
side of the water, between the flower-beds
and the meadow ; and put in a word for a
durable bridge of stone or brick for general
use, rather than the wooden one in Mr
Tenable's mind ; but his glances followed
Sybil's movements, and from time to
time he drew her into the conversation,
as if it were a pleasure to hear her
speak.

He was a man little, if any, older than
Hugh Furnival, had travelled much, and
was a conversable companion ; but he had
not the like attractions of form and feature,

and there was more of sadness than of fire
in his deep-set eyes.

As he said, he had known much sorrow ;
had returned to the Riddingss after long
absence, to find that he was the last of his
race ; and the face of his father's old
friend, in the Altringham market-place,
was a welcome sight to him. But Gerard
looked as if the old friend's daughter had
been a still more welcome sight. His
glance seemed to follow her every movement,
as if fascinated.

He lingered, as if loth to depart, until
indeed the arrival of a cart with the purchases
of the previous day warned the
young squire to take leave.

That visit was but the precursor of many
more, a hearty welcome from Mr Venables
being sure to greet him, even if Sybil
was not always to be seen.

Young Tatton also came riding across
the moor from Wyvenshaw ; but his fox-hunting
proclivities were not much in
accord with the grave and studious habits
of Mr Venables, and his reception was

of another sort than was accorded to
Gerard.

He not only came often, but he stayed
long, and was a favourite, especially with
the father, in whose improvements he took
all the interest of a fellow landowner ; then,
he was always ready in an afternoon or
evening to play a game at backgammon
with him, in hope of a song from Sybil,
or a tune on her spinet, and well content
to watch her knitting-pins flash or her
spinning-wheel revolve, under the impulse
of her slender fingers, if so be he could
only win a word or a smile from her sweet
lips by times.

Yet as only the brightly-polished flax-wheel
was portable, and as the wool-wheel
was a fixture against the wall of her private
sitting-room, the one being a mere toy compared
with the other, and as she had taken
to wool-spinning with an earnestness which
Thomas Venables construed into forgetfulness
of Hugh Furnival, it often served to
excuse her absence from the household-room
when the two men were occupied with

politics, or the backgammon board, or the
popular game of fox and goose.

And this occurred more frequently than
either approved, and generally when Mrs
Leicester happened to have stepped in to
see Miss Venables.

By this time the portly widow had contrived
to obtain a familiar footing in the
house ; her offer to improve Sybil's acquaintance
with her new wheel having
opened the path. Mrs Leicester was
always obliging, she was a near neighbour,
and Mr Venables was well pleased that his
daughter should take interest in anyone
and anything — except Hugh Furnival —
and he tolerated the widow for the sake of
his child, hoping that companionship would
prevent brooding over the past.

He would have preferred a younger
friend for her, either Miss Tatton, or Miss
Legs from Baguley, but he did not interfere
with the girl's choice ; and was rather
pleased than otherwise that she carried her
portly person and free manners where they
did not jar on his personal sensibilities.

He had no suspicion, not he, that when
Sybil carried her sewing or her knitting
to Mrs Leicester's cottage now and then,
or when the latter came to the Oaklandss,
and, after a gossip, retreated with Sybil
to her own room, whence the musical hum
of the big wheel could be heard by all in
that portion of the eccentric and rambling
house, that either was a cover for a
meeting with Hugh Furnival. Still less,
that the beguiling widow artfully kept
the humming wheel in motion once or
twice whilst Sybil, at her suggestion,
slipped down the secluded and rarely-used
staircase, close by her room door, for a
hurried interview with the nephew, waiting
under the shadow of the twilight and the
trees.

Had the young creature, so ignorant of
the world, so easily led by her affections,
but confessed to her father the promise
extracted from her in a moment of surprise
and weakness, he would have kept Mrs
Leicester and her false advice at bay, would
have been at once adviser, shield, and support

to his child. But at the time Sybil's
heart prompted the admission of her error,
she could not overcome her awe of his outward
austerity, and no such opportune
moment ever came again.

As it was, that first meeting with Hugh
at his aunt's cottage — in itself a surrender
of filial duty and obedience — served to
undermine resolution and riorht feelings
all at once, but one meeting; led to
another, and another followed that.

Mrs Leicester, in her nephew's interest,
argued away the girl's right-minded scruples,
and impassioned Hugh, who came rushing
across country at the risk of his neck for
half-an-hour's speech with her, either in the
grounds or at his aunt's cottage, was
hardly to be gainsaid.

Do you think a woman of my years
would sanction anything that was wrong .'* "
was asked by the cunning and unscrupulous
widow as an argument for these clandestine
meetings.

It is cruel to deny me a few minutes,
when I come so far and love you so dearly,"

was the lover's plea ; whilst the arm round
her waist and the eloquent lips and eyes
had other arguments as strong.

You can meet that fellow Gerard at
Bowdon church, walk home by his side,
listen to him, talk to him, sing to him, yet
you grudge me a stolen half-hour after
weeks of pain and absence. If I do not
see you, I can hear of it, and there are
times in my desperation I feel as if I could
shoot the fellow, so happy in your smiles,"
he said, when ere long jealousy added fuel
to the fire of Hugh's passion.

Few and weeks apart were these stealthy
interviews, and chiefly in the shady parlour
behind the beehives at Mrs Leicester's ;
but letters came and went, and not always
through the same feminine courier.

Little Billy Barnes, who now rejoiced ina
pair of clogs and a warm suit of homespun,
and who flourished under the united
patronage of Josh and Miss Venables, and
who somewhere or somehow had imbibed
a wholesome dread of her stern and dark-browed
sire, carried more than one billet

in his breeches' pocket ; and the Httle lad,
who worshipped the flaxen-haired beauty,
would have died rather than betray his
trust even to his own father, whose loom
was once more at work ; for Ursula kept
the maids at their wheel as busily as their
mistress at hers.

Then when with the waning year night
shadows crept on, and outdoor labour
ceased earlier, Hugh urged that there was
less fear of observation, and then she might
surely meet him more frequently. I will
not say Sybil had no misgivings, but they
were silenced.

Not altogether. In the solitude of her
own sitting-room, brightened by her father's
care, when the large wheel of her predecessor
hummed its loudest, and she stepped backward
and forward drawing out and twining
her delicate line of woollen yarn, there was
often an undertone of reproach in its music.
Or when seated in the glow of the fire on
the open hearth, opposite to her father,
engrossed in a book or his accounts — or in
the summer bower he had delicately created

for her pleasure — she knitted in silence,
there was often a voice in her heart accusing
her of duplicity in knitting hose for her
father in his sight, and for her lover in the
privacy of her own room. It was as though
she alternated between two loves, or it maybe
between love and duty.

And so the seasons came and went, and
with them guests to the Oaklandss ; but none
so frequently as Squire Gerard, the one
of whom her secret lover was so jealous.

Ay, long before that summer evening,
when Sybil's father laid down his volume
and broke the silence with a composed
announcement that their gallant neighbour,
who had been her devotee so many months,
was desirous to make her the mistress of
Riddingss Hall.

She started to her feet. Her knitting
dropped to the floor and became the kitten's
prey.

You cannot mean it ! Oh, father, remember
Hugh ! "

Remember the scheming Jacobite ? I
thought thou hadst forgotten him ere this? "

Forgotten Hugh ! Oh, sir, that is impossible
! " she murmured, holding by the
tall chair-back for support.

Her father's dark brows contracted, and
the old stern look she had not seen so long,
came back to his face. Yet was there a
curl of doubt on his lips as he said, " Nothing
Is impossible. Calf-love is not eternal.
Hugh Furnival has forgotten thee,
and the new wooer will make amends for
the old one."

A denial of Hugh's inconstancy rose to
her lips, but died away in a faint " Nay,
nay !

And I say yea, Syb. So look your
best when the squire comes for his answer,
and speak to him kindly, like a good and
dutiful daughter."

She always did look her best in the
bewildered eyes of the young squire, until
that bright morning in August, when she
met his stammering love-suit with an
agitated entreaty that he would not persecute
her.

He had been prepared for some reserve,

which would wear away in time ; and all
he could answer was, " I do not want to
persecute or hurry you, Miss Venables ;
I would not trouble your mind for the
world. Give me but the shadow of hope.
I can wait."

This was more than she could do, but
still he hoped — and waited.

Patience and a good cause win in the
long-run. The lass is only shy," was the
solace Thomas Venables gave to the disconcerted
suitor as they stood together on
the red brick bridge, which had superseded
the old stepping-stones, and Gerard looked
ruefully on his own melancholy visage in
the smooth water below. " Take my word
for it, Sybil will consent to be thy wife
before this year's swallows take flight."

And for lack of better assurance, the
devoted suitor took what comfort he could
from the confident father's word, and
waited with tolerable patience.

Squire Gerard's horse could have
brought his master to the Oaklandss blindfold,
so often was he stabled and fed there

VOL. I. E

before the swallows took winof. And the
patient wooer came and went, or lingered
by the side of Sybil, whether she tended
her flowers or sat silent sewing a seam ; content
so long as he met with no open rebuff.

But long before the first swallow plumed
its wings for flight, another bird had flown
its parent nest.

The loud neighing of a horse in the lane,
and the barking of the mastiff by the gate,
had roused Mr Venables out of his first
sleep one night, at the close of September ;
but the horseman rode off, and he turned
on his pillow and went to sleep again, only
thinking some of his neighbours kept late
hours.

Miss Venables was wont to rise with the
lark. When Ursula went to her room for
the keys in the morning, no Sybil was
there — only a letter.

Trembling and quaking in every limb,
the old servant carried it at arm's length
to her master, and as she toke Josh afterwards,
" I thought he'd ha' stiffened to
stone at the sight on it."

He had crushed the tear-stained letter in
his strong grip, as he set his teeth behind
close lips ; but then he smoothed it carefully
out, not relaxing a muscle of his rigid
face ; and, when Gerard came a few hours
later, it was flung to him in answer to his
inquiries for Miss Venables.

It was the deluded father's only explanation.
Then he tore the letter into shreds.
Of pursuit he would not hear.

By this time she has ceased to be
Sybil Venables, and no longer belongs
to me," was said, sternly.

He locked the door of the rifled room
upon her spinning-wheel and all besides,
saying, as he turned the key, —

Disobedience brings its own punishment.
Let me never hear the ingrate's
name assail under this roof. I have closed
the door of my heart as I have closed the
door of this room, never to be opened
more."

It was spoken as the mandate of a despot.
Indisputable and irrevocable, as a
decree of the Modes and Persians.

LIFE AT SPRING-HOLM FARM.

Under the rule of Cromwell and
the Commonwealth the English
law of marriage was most stringent.
At the Restoration —
with many another law for the preservation
of order — it was relaxed, until it became
so loose that all the formality necessary
to make a marriage binding was the
performance of the ceremony by a man
in holy orders ; it mattered not when or
where. Gross abuses led, in 1753, to
Parliamentary enactments against clandestine
marriages, and since then other
Acts have been passed to regulate and
define a legal marriage.

But when Sybil Venables, after long
hesitation, allowed herself to be overpersuaded,
and stealing down the secluded
back staircase like a ghost at midnight,
and across the deserted courtyard in the
full light of the harvest moon, and only
paused to reflect for one moment on the
bridge built in fatherly love, as she crossed
it in her flight to the meadow gate, well
away from the restless mastiff — when she
thus quitted her confiding father's roof in
silence and secrecy, there were no such
restrictions.

There were, however, restrictions upon
intercourse and correspondence. Only the
larger towns could boast the luxury of a
post-office ; and, albeit a market-town, with
a staple trade, and governed by a mayor,
Altringham, which had no church of its
own, was scarcely likely to have a postoffice.
Even half-century later it had
only a receiving-house for the post at
Knutsford, eight miles away. Those few
who had the need and the ability to write
letters were compelled to entrust them to

private messengers or the public carriers ;
and, when addressed to an out-of-the-way
place like Timperley, have them left at
some ordinary house of call, and trust to
the chapter of accidents for delivery when
unexpected — and, consequently, unasked
for.

Thus, the packet containing the respectful
and apologetic letters of Hugh and
Sybil Furnival — written the very day
after their marriage at Prestbury Church,
and carried to Altringham by Hugh the
following market-day — remained for weeks
where it was stuck, along with others, in
the leaden frame-work of the glass screen
round the bar of the " Unicorn."

Hugh had depended on Mrs Leicester
to become the bearer of this packet, and
had sought her out for the purpose ; but,
although she had done her utmost to bring
matters to this issue, she discreetly declined
to make her complicity known. Nay, she
went so far as to say that Hugh had been
precipitate, and had carried matters further
than ever she had expected ; and, when

brought shortly to book by her nephew,
boldly declared she thought he would
have asked the old gentleman's consent,
and not have carried his treasure off on the
sly. She had disclaimed all knowledge of
the affair to Ursula, she owned, and it
would never do to carry their letters and
prove herself a go-between at last.

Hugh stood aghast at her barefaced
double-dealing. With a muttered something
that was not a blessing, he turned on
his heel in search of another messenger ;
and, finding no one sufficiently trustworthy
who was willing to undertake the embassy
and brave Thomas Venables' displeasure, he
carried the bulky missive to the " Unicorn,"
and paid the customary fee for its display
against the dim pane, nothing doubting it
would reach his new father-in-law in a week
or so.

Farmers came in week by week, and
country squires, who read the superscription
and shrugged their shoulders, for the
story of the runaway match had spread far
and wide ; but Thomas Venables had never

crossed the threshold of the inn or shown
his face in Altringham from the day his
idolised daughter had disgraced herself
and him by her flight.

He kept within his own grounds and
excluded visitors, a stern, self-contained
man, whose contracted brows alone told
the pain within.

To Squire Gerard alone were his gates
freely open, and to him not so much for
converse as for companionship. They had
both loved the same object, and lost. Her
name was never mentioned between them,
but they looked in each other's faces,
grasped each other's hands, and knew
their sympathy was mutual.

There had been the like sensitive disinclination
for "greetings in the market-place,"
and the free questions and comments of
other men. For those were days of coarse
jest and badinage, when no wound was
sacred from rouo-h handling.

The younger man was by nature the
more elastic, and the sooner inclined to
seek relief in crowds. It was he who

found the packet addressed to "Thomas
Venables, Esquire," in the bar window of
the " Unicorn," a month after it had been
placed there, and volunteered to carry it
to the Oaklandss.

But the intelligence conveyed in the
long-delayed missives — that Sybil was
the wife of Hugh Furnival, had been
united to him in Prestbury Church by his
cousin, the Rev. Thomas Coppock, who
had journeyed from Manchester to perform
the ceremony — had been rudely anticipated,
and all there was of deferential
entreaty for reconciliation was lost. It
was too late.

Altringham's one lawyer was closeted
with Mr Venables in his library, when the
squire — who bore his own disappointment
manfully — entered. A marriage certificate
and other papers lay on the table.

"See, Gerard," cried the old man bitterly,
that harpy Furnival has not long waited
to lay his claws on the three thousand
pounds her uncle left the girl ! " He did
not say " Sybil." " Well, she has flung

herself 2i\N2iy ; let the money go after her.
And tell them, sir" (to the attorney), "to
make the most of it, for not one penny-piece
will she have of mine, now or ever !
The ingrate ! "

I found this at the ' Unicorn,' sir. It
has been lying there a month at least," said
the squire, with a stifled sigh, handing him
the package. " I think it is from — from
her."

A bright fire was blazing between the
brass dogs on the hearth. Barely was the
superscription glanced at when the unopened
package was flung into the flames,
and all that might perchance have softened
his austerity smouldered to ashes.

The intervention and remonstrance of
the other two were of no avail.

Gerard's love was of a noble order, and
he endeavoured to effect a reconciliation.

He might as well have tried persuasion
to a rock.

The certificate was pushed across the
table to the squire of Riddingss.

Coppock ! " exclaimed he ; " surely not

the young parson I saw at the tanner's a
while back ? "

Ay," answered Mr Venables grimly ;
a nephew of his, the son of the man who
made my coats when I cared to pay for
fashion. The nephew of the woman whose
house I now hold."

Was not Mrs Leicester a Coppock ?"
put the squire meditatively, the paper still
in his hand.

Ay," jerked out the exasperated father ;
"and I hear, now it is too late, that they
are kin to the Furnivals. There has been
a plot, a vile plot, to rob me of my child's
duty and affection ; and that woman Leicester
coming and going, with her smooth
face, has been the prime mover from first
to last ! Sic comes here no more." There
was a brief pause ; then, turning to the
lawyer, he went on, in changed tones,
slowly and deliberately, as if delivering a
fiat, — " In three days, master lawyer, have
the transfer-deed in readiness, and a quittance
for all that is hard cash. I will
trouble you to make my will at the same

time — and here. Good day ! " and the
lawyer was dismissed.

By the following Saturday SylDilla's own
fortune had passed into the hands of her
husband, and her father had disinherited
her ; had made a will which did not even
contain her name.

If Mrs Leicester had any ulterior motive
beyond love for her own nephew, she had
made a mistake, had done her own business
effectually. The gate of the Oaklandss
was barred against her, Mr Venables
passed her by in the lanes, or in the church
porch, without recognition, though she
curtsied low ; and, to her further mortification,
the tanner's wife was there to see !

To Sybil it was all heartbreaking. She
had run counter to her father's will, deluded
into the belief that his love was too strong
to cast her off; that she had only to sue
for forgiveness and obtain pardon ; that
she would be recalled, and Hugh with her ;
and that all would end happily as a fairy
tale.

With the making of her father's will, and

his stern message, all her bright hopes of
reconciliation died out, and she stood
aghast with dismay.

Her first impulse was to gallop off to
Timperley and force herself into his presence,
but Hugh restrained her.

Why should you abase yourself only to
be spurned ? " he asked, " Would you goto
hear your husband maligned ? Leave
him alone. He will come round in time.
So show a brave front, Sybil mine ; " and
with his kisses and caresses he strove to
chase her compunctions.

He assured her he loved her, not her
money, and cared little if her father cut
her off without a shilling. There would
be good days coming ere long, when he
would carve a fortune for her, and, may be,
win the Oaklandss to boot, in spite of
parchment. A covert allusion to the return
of the exiled Stuartss to the throne,
which she well understood.

Sybil was somewhat bewildered between
her father's loyalty to the king upon
the throne, and her husband's loyalty to

the king without a kingdom ; but the fire
and enthusiasm in Huo-h's handsome face
and glowing speech carried her with him,
if not to conviction.

They were still living at Spring-Holm
farm when Hucjh came home from Altering
ham laden with coin and credentials for
the remainder of his wife's three thousand
pounds ; and there is no doubt the cash in
hand tended to soothe the irritation and
ill-humour visible in Farmer Furnival and
his dame at the disinheritance of the " lady-wife
Hugh had brought home to them with
no more clothes than would fill a pair o'
saddle-bags." But their equanimity was
speedily disturbed.

So long as Sybil could build on a recall
home to all her possessions there, she resisted
her husband's offer to replenish her
scanty wardrobe. But now that the last
hope was dispelled, and that he had means
of her own at command, she was as anxious
to equip herself as any other bride.

A horse was saddled, Hugh mounted
Sybil on a pillion behind him, they forded

the bright Bollin, where is now a bridge of
many arches, and rode off to Macclesfield
the next market-day to visit the mercer's,
and mantua - maker's, and cordwainer's.
And so proud was he of his bride, and so
anxious that she should not feel she had
married beneath her, that he was lavish
rather than wise in the choice of materials
and habiliments, over-ruling her better
judgment.

Moreover, Sybil rode back to Spring-holm
on a horse he had bought for her
own use, with a fine new saddle.

There were glum looks in the farm
kitchen that night.

Marry come up ! Would nothing suit
my lady but a horse to ride, and silks and

furbelows, as if she had married the

•\ J)
squire :

She brought the money to buy them,
and has a right to have them," answered
Hugh testily.

You'll soon gallop the money away,
my lad, at the pace thought going," his
father put in.

Ay ! and plain linen and linsey might
serve the turn of a farmer's wife, if she had
a tabinet for Sundays, without fal-lals.
An' be those fine shoes, with roses and
high heels, to carry her into the shipping
a-milking ? " questioned the dame sarcastically.


Sybil milk ! That's Betty's work ! "
cried the young man sharply.

And why not Sybil's. Be she too
fine or too proud to milk a cow ? "

Neither too fine nor too proud to be
useful. But I'll not have her asked to
milk the cows."

Hoity-toity, now ! A farmer's wife and
not milk a cow ! Thou's brought thy pigs
to a pretty market."

This was the first altercation between
Hugh and the old people over his "lady-wife,"
but by no means the last. And they
were not carried on in undertones to spare
Sybil's ears ; and not all Hugh's fondness
or all his care could shield her from rude
shocks.

There is a good deal of rough and slopping

work about a farmhouse, and Sybil
did not care to handle a mop and pail, anymore
than to carry a brimming milk-pail
on her head to the dairy ; and the good
dame thought her squeamish.

She would have helped the dame with
her cookery ; but there her very skill was
at fault. " What good be kickshaws for
hungry men ?" was asked ; and her delicate
pastry was pronounced " nothing to bite at."

Get to thy wheel, lass ! " the old woman
would say ; " thought fit for nothing in the
Vassal world but to spin."

And Sybil, who had ruled so proudly
and ably her father's household, with servants
to do her bidding, and friends to say
Well done ! " sat down to spin her flaxen
thread, or pace backwards and forwards
drawing out the yarn of wool, with a monotonous
hum and burr-r-r in her ears that
was no longer a song of hope or joy, buta
dreary, wearisome drone, which seemed
like a wail for the years that were gone
and the home she had forsaken.

There she was loved and respected, her

VOL. I. F

own mistress and that of others, to whom
her word was law ; there she had a private
room for work or recreation (she did not say
devotion ") ; there were more books than
she cared to read ; there was her sweet
spinet wherewith to while away a vacant
hour, and so win her father's thanks ; there,
too, she had the constant interchange of
thought with a man of birth and breeding ;
there she was courted and admired.

Here all, save Hugh, were coarse and
unmannerly, and her very refinement was
held in contempt ; here her domestic arts
and accomplishments were rated as below
the skill of the lowest drudge on the
farm ; books and music were not — she had
been told " the best spinet was a cheese-press
; " here she was a wife without a wife's
authority, something between mistress and
maid, yet neither. And, worst of all, here
there was no privacy, not even for long-neglected
prayer and self-communion. Not
even at church could she feel herself alone,
for there she occupied another seat, was
made to feel her lowered rank. The benefactor's

name writ up in letters of gold was
no longer hers. Hats that had been lowly-doffed
at Miss Venables' approach barely
left their wearers' sconces ; gentry, who
had formerly chatted familiarly on their
way through the churchyard, passed herby
with a bare recognition.

All this and more the big wheel seemed
to burr-r-r in her ears, until half wild she
would tear away the bunch of loose wool
from her waist (for the wool-spinner
wrought much as does the rope-maker
still from a bunch of hemp or tow at
the waist), and rush out into the garden
or meadows to rid herself of its monotonous
drone and suggestive undertones.

Or she would rush to the stable and, if
Hugh was not at hand, saddle her horse
herself — she had now no obsequious serv-inhuman
at command — and set off at a
gallop to shake her rebellious heart into
its place, and school herself into the lesson
she was learning so late — submission.

As you make your bed so you must
lie," Dame Furnival had said to her before

her marrlaofe was three weeks old ; but she
was finding the bed harder every day, and
it was not softened by the reflection that
it was of her own making.

Only in Hugh's love had she any hope
or comfort, and even he seemed another
man on the farm and away from it. He
was no more his own master than she was
mistress there, and they were both made
to feel it.

There was evidently some disappointment
either in the girl herself or her endowment,
and there was a quarrel between
the farmer and his son because he refused
to hand over more than a third of
her cash into his keeping.

Indeed, quarrels were not infrequent,
for the father was as hot-tempered and impetuous
as his son, and often some shortcoming
or fashion of Sybil's caused the
first word. The hours she wasted on
horseback, and the extravagance of keeping
a horse for neither cart nor plough,
were standing grievances.

Hugh was fiery in defence of his beloved

and beautiful wife ; but a wife Is
never the better loved for needing defence
against her husband's kin, and Sybil
began to fear this.

She had another cause for apprehension
a vague something, she could not tell
what.

His cousin, the Rev. Thomas Coppock,
had long been gone from Spring-Holm,
but letters, mysteriously delivered, which
came from him to Hugh, were at once
destroyed, and were answered as secretly
and mysteriously, or she thought so. At
such times she would observe the heads of
Hush and his father close together as if
in earnest conference, but always out of
earshot.

Her father's bitter invectives against
Hugh as a 'plotting Jacobite' now recurred
to her, and she trembled lest some
harm should come to him with all this
mystery.

She upbraided Hugh with having secrets
she did not share, reminding him of his
oft-repeated vows to share every thought

of his heart with her ; but he only patted
her on the cheek, and answered, laughingly,—


Ah ! I was a lover then, Sybil, I ama
husband now ; and, dearest, if it was
wise and needful for thee to keep a
secret from thy father, may it not be as
wise and as needful for me to keep a
secret from my wife ? "

It was lightly and gaily spoken, and the
argument was conclusively sealed with a
kiss on her brow, for Hugh was as masterful
as her father ; but he had roused a
thought never to slumber again.

He, who had prompted and urged her
to deceive her father, was the first to
retaliate, if not taunt her with it. She
was told she could expect no more confidence
from her husband than she had
rendered to her parent ; and in anguish
and bitterness she asked herself over andover
again, " Was it either wise or needful
to have secrets from my father ? " The
unwisdom had become painfully apparent.

Not that Hugh loved her less, but that

others loved her not, and he did not trust
her wholly.

She began, too, to feel that her father
had known more than he had told ; and
that, if prejudice had blinded him, prepossession
had equally blinded her.

Sybil had been married little more
than six months, yet she had begun to
repent her disobedience and precipitation,
and to long ardently for her old home
and the good father she had so unwisely
quitted.

Now and then Hugh had met his Aunt
Leicester in the Altringham market-place,
and had even been passed by Thomas
Venables with a set face and darkening
brows ; but he never brought her back
any cheering news or any prospect of
pardon, and he refused to take her with
him on market-days, lest she should encounter
her father and be as sternly met.

For some time she had turned her deft
hand to butter-making on the farm, but
she had not brought down her pride to
stand in the market and offer it for sale, as

did other farmers' wives. And Dame
Furnival was as strongly against her "going
on an idle jaunt" as was Hugh in his
care for her.

At last, unable to bear her own pain,
she mounted her horse one fine spring
mornings when the laburnums were shedding
their golden tears, and the lilacs began
to fade ; and, heeding not the bird-melody
of the season, she patted the neck of
Chevalier, and was off through the intricate
network of green lanes, and along a highway
almost as green, to the beloved old
home at Timperley, resolved to throw
herself at her father's feet and entreat
forgiveness.

She had only memory as a guide ; memory
of the flitting when she rode so unwillingly
on by her father's side — memory
of a starlit ride by the same route on a
pillion behind Hugh to meet the Rev.
Thomas Coppock in Prestbury Church,
when the vicar warily held aloof, and the
clerk who brought the keys and signed the
book as witness seemed half afraid.

All that and more came back to her
in that long rough ride, at least sixteen
or eighteen miles (Hugh, riding across
hedges, ditches, brooks, or rivers, had
been wont to halve it, spurred by love).
She rode on regardless of fatigue, with
her brain at high pressure, rehearsing
as she went all she would say to
soften her father's heart, her own the
while beating faster than Chevalier's
hoofs.

A new brick wall, a solid oaken gate,
had arisen to shut her out of the Oak-lands,
and no prayer of hers could
move a bar. Josh looked out through
a tiny trap, muttered " Oi daurna!" and
then shut it in her face.

Faint, sick, dizzy, she attempted to turn
her horse's head, then, reeling in the
saddle, urged him on.

A poor weaver, who had a cottage on
the confines of Baguley Moor, to the north
of the Oaklandss, found her lying on the
sward by the wayside half-a-mile from
Thomas Venables' gate. A riderless hon-^

Sybil.

flying past with bridle loose had led him to
look for her.

The canvas poke which had held warp
and weft for his loom was thrown down
in his haste to succour. Many a piece of
homespun had filled his loom for Miss
Venables ; many a coin had found its way
to his pocket from hers ; many a gift to
his children ; many a kind word had she
said to cheer them. And her luckless
love-match had been the talk of the
country-side.

FORTUNES WHEEL.

HEN Chevalier found his way
back to Spring Holm without
his mistress, all was already in
commotion. Sybil's absence
from the mid-day meal had brought down
on Hugh the free comments and sharp
censure of his mother on the wife he had
chosen, and he answered hotly, as usual,
the father striking in, regardless of the
listening men and maids at the common
table.

Already stung by his mother's taunts,
the empty saddle drove Hugh Furnival
almost frantic. Half mad, he flung himself

across his own fresh horse, barebacked,
to scour the country in search of his wife,
all the men on the farm turnings out likewise.


Night fell before he found her, lying
unconscious and helpless in the weaver's
lonely cottage ; a bare-legged lad despatched
by Barnes to Mrs Leicester —
no other than sharp little Billy — having
met him by the way, his grimy face all
streaked with the course of tears.

It was a sorry sight for Hugh Furnival,
when he bent his head to the low doorway
of the hut, built at some time by Barnes
himself from turf and stones found on the
moor. Bare enough was the room, in
which the loom by the broad low window
was the chief furniture. A roughly-made
table, with three legs, and a bench as
rough made up the list, if we except a
stool or so. The floor was simply of clay,
hardened and smoothed by long trampling.

On the bench, where a bundle of weft
had been placed for a pillow, lay his fair
Sybil, her flaxen hair all in disorder, a

J

spot of unnatural red on either cheek, and
a strange, incoherent medley of words on
her tongue.

The weaver's wife, whose linen mutch
was white and clean, though her blue linen
over-gown and homespun petticoat were
none of the newest, was endeavouring to
make her swallow a soothing potion she
had concocted from herbs, bunches of
which decorated the rafters of the low,
thatched roof.

Barnes had found her apparently lifeless,
and all his wife's homely skill had
been exercised to restore animation.

Hugh's hand was an open one, and both
the weaver and his wife had reason to
rejoice over their humanity.

Poor young thing," said they, " it was
little enough we could do for her ; didn't
she save us fro' chemin', an' help to keep
the loom aofoin' } "

The sward had been soft, and the
mental shock had been worse to Sybil
than that of her fall. Barnes had gone
to Altringham himself for an apothecary.

The patient was at once " blooded " by the
man of lancets and boluses ; and, before
night, was pronounced out of immediate
danger.

But Sybil never went back to Spring-holm,


She was carried with care and caution
to Mrs Leicester's for recovery, and then
Hugh severed his connection with the
farm, and bore his wife off to Manchester.
There his Uncle Coppock, the fashionable
tailor of Short-mitigate (the chief thoroughfare
from the Market Place to the Collegiate
Church), opened his doors to receive
them, at the instance of his son, the Rev.
Thomas Coppock, Bea,, who had married
them.

Whether any inkling of this disastrous
occurrence — almost at his own gate — ever
reached the ears of Thomas Venables, was
unknown. He had forbidden the utterance
of his daughter's name, and he made
no sign.

Squire Gerard heard, and his sad eyes
grew sadder.

In Manchester a new world seemed to
open out to Sybil Furnival ; and her
Hugh also seemed to become another
man. It was not alone that he cast the
slough of his country garb and came out a
full-blown beau, with wide coat-skirts and
ruffled wrists, snuff-box, periwig and gold-laced
hat. He had also cast aside his
country manners and conversation, talked
more of swords than of scythes, and discussed
matters with his uncle's many
visitors, which Sybil feared were fraught
with danger.

And much Sybil wondered at the
number and character of those visitors to
John Coppock, the Mitigate tailor — customers
they could scarcely all be, though
she knew tailors did occasionally work for
women as well as for men.

Sedan chairs set down dignified, long-stomacher
dames, with jacques of silken
damask or tabinet over enormous hoops,
with hoods to cover their powdered heads
and screen their faces. Men of fortune
and position also came, exchanged a word

or two with John Coppock or his sons,
shook hands with Hugh warmly, and went,
only to re-appear another day.

Amongst these a certain Dr Byrom was
the most prominent, and Sybil liked him
well, for, though only a teacher of a shorthand
which he had invented, he was a wit
and a poet ; his humour was overflowing,
and he had always a verse or an epigram
at command.

He was a man about fifty three, with a
kindly, intelligent face under his full wig ;
and he took quite a fatherly interest in the
young couple, the secret of which is easily
told. He belonged to an old, proud and
wealthy family, owning large estates near
Manchester ; and, marrying his cousin
without his father's consent, had been
abruptly discarded, and never received
into favour.

His wife and daughter were introduced
to Mrs Furnival, and after that she was a
welcome visitor at the house of the Barons
in Hanging-Ditch (a ditch only perpetuated
by name) ; little Mrs Byrom entering fully

into her anxieties, well remembering the
sorrows and struggles of their own early
married life. Her sympathy was very
cheering to Sybil, but even she seemed to
have a mysterious air of reservation at times.

Now and again a card-party would gather
under the roof of the Coppices, but there
was more of conversation than cards, and
much of the former was enigmatical to
Sybil. The introduction of a bowl of
punch and another of water was the signal
for these parties to break up. Every glass
was then filled to the brim, the hand that
held it was extended over the water-bowl.
"To the King!" was said, loyally, and in
honour to the toast every glass was emptied
to the dress.

On the first of these occasions to which
Sybil was admitted, she, who knew that
none but friends of the exiled Stuartss were
there received, expressed her surprise.

"The king?" said she.

Tush ! my child," explained Dr Byrom,
do you not see, we drink the king — over
the water. God bless the kine ! "

VOL. I. G

Then you mean the Pretender ? " added
she, innocently enough.

Hush ! my dear, I mean — " and he
nodded significantly, —

God bless the king — I mean our faith's defender ;
God bless — no harm in blessing — the Pretender ;
But who pretender is, and who is king,
God bless my soul, that's quite another thing'"

And, with a flourish of his hat, he bowed
himself out.

Her father was right. Hugh and his
friends certainly were Jacobites, but she
had not altogether learned to think with
her husband that the Georges were
usurpers, or that it was the duty of every
right-minded man or woman to strive to
bring the banished Stuartss back.

Meanwhile they were living merrily,
and she had no suspicion how rapidly her
three thousand pounds were melting.
Hugh was always sanguine, and spoke of
buying a commission in the army, as if
that were a certain provision for the
future ; and she, in her ignorance, believed
him.

During this time there was a boy born
to them ; and the pair, who agreed that
he was a perfect marvel of a babe, had
a warm dispute concerning his name.
Nothing less than that of the exiled young
prince would do for Hugh, and Sybil
was as steadfast in adopting that of her
own father. It ended in a compromise.
When the child was baptised by the Rev.
Thomas Coppock, he named it Charles
Thomas ; but those around noticed, as the
child drew, that the father called him
Charlie, the mother always Tom.

It was apparently a slight difference,
but it was a difference, and told of a deep-seated
yearning for the father and the
home she had lost, for which her marriage
had not compensated.

The child had seen the light three
months when 1745 opened its tearful
eyes ; and, as the months went round, so
did he grow and thrive, and still they
lingered at the fashionable tailor's, free
with cash and no burden to their host.

Summer had ripened its harvests in the

field when another harvest began to ripen
for the field, and first whispers, then
rumours, confirmed that Charles Edward,
the young Pretender, had landed in Scotland,
and that there was a general gathering
of the clans around him.

There was a general stir among the
Manchester Jacobites, and sure in the
Coppock house, where was a constant
coming and o-oina-.

Hugh Furnival and Thomas Coppock,
the one on his own horse, the other on
Sybil's, rode away on secret embassies,
and brought back news of the Prince's
glorious advance, the proclamation of King
James, the success and ovation of his progress.
Then that Sir John Cope, sent to
oppose him, was defeated near Edinburgh,
at Prestonpans ; and all was glee and
enthusiasm at the Coppices'. Only
Sybil had forebodings.

The year had travelled on to the closing
days of cheerless November. The Prince
who had certainly wasted time in Carlisle
was in Preston, within thirty miles of

Manchester, and the bridges over the
Mersey were broken down to arrest his
progress south.

On the morning of the 27th, a single
sergeant, who had without orders marched
from Preston during the night, entered
Manchester with one drnmnier and a
woman, wearing the white cockade, and
beating up for recruits — and he got them,
if not in the numbers he had counted on.

At nightfall came Prince Charles with
the vanguard of his army. A fine brick
mansion, standing back from Market-Stead
Lane, was requisitioned as his palace. A
bellman went round the town — not a
very large town then — to give notice of
levies to be exacted, and of quarters required
for the soldiers of King James, and
all the place was in an uproar. The loyal
inhabitants shook and trembled, and parted
with their coin on compulsion.

The Jacobites, in high feather, illuminated
their houses, and pressed forward to do
homage. And from the high double steps
of the "palace" the Prince harangued the

multitude assembled in the open area in
front. There Colonel Townley proudly
drew up his Manchester regiment, three
hundred strong, to which the Rev. Thomas
Coppock had been appointed chaplain, and
in which a younger brother, John, and
Hugh Furnival had obtained commissions ;
though how much of Sybil's money had
gone to the purchase she, poor girl, never
knew.

When, on the list of December, the
Manchester regiment marched, with one
division of Highlanders, through Altringr-
ham, en route for Derby as a stage towards
London (having bridged the river with
felled poplar trees and planks), Sybil
mounted on Chevalier, with her boy before
her, rode alongside the marching regiment,
keeping as close to her husband as circumstances
would permit, sad enough at heart.
She saw the wool-comber looking out over
the half-door of his shop, and drew in her
breath with a gasp.

The boy clapped his little hands at the
music, and just then Sybil's eyes encountered

those of her father, standing sternly
erect by Squire Gerard's side.

A look of mingled sorrow, scorn, and
shame crossed his fine face, and then he
turned away.

She would have cried out to him, but
her tongue seemed tied ; another moment,
and he was gone.

How keenly the contrast smote her
between this ride through Altrino^ham
market-place and that other when she was
Sybil Venables ! It was overpowering,
for she had been reared in allegiance to
the reigning dynasty, and had not even the
enthusiasm of a righteous cause to uphold
her. Her child's prattle scarcely roused her.

The weather broke. The boy became
weary, uncomfortable, and restless ; she had
much ado to keep her cloak around him.
Hugh gave his " bonnie Charlie " a caressing
word now and then, himself elate ; but
her heart sank.

There was a halt at Macclesfield for rest
and refreshment, the gathering in of stragglers
and recruits ; but when they reached

Derby on the 4th, Sybil was utterly worn
out, and so was the poor little fellow in
her lap.

Wet, hungry, fatigued — they were by no
means alone in their discomfort — yet
neither shelter nor food was provided. The
mayor had flown, and not until an alderman
(too lame to decamp) was forcibly
made to proclaim " King James," could free
quarters be exacted ; and then the people
were unwilling to receive them. Hugh,
coming with the advance, in white laced
blue uniform, with scarlet vest, at last
secured a large house for the ladies ; but
the troops pouring in six a-breast, many
with disordered dress, and dirty, footsore,
and exhausted, were marshalled in the
market-place under their drooping standard
— St Andrew's red cross on a whitefield
— to await the coming of the Prince ;
the bagpipes playing to keep their spirits up.

Not until dusk did the Prince arrive —
a tall, straight, handsome man, wrapped ina
Highland plaid, with a broadsword by his
side, and a white bob-wig under his gold-laced

green bonnet — and not until then
could the soldiers be billeted or dispersed
to find quarters for themselves ; many huddling
together in sheds and passages,
wherever there was the shelter of a roof,
scrambling and almost fiorhtinor for food.
The Prince himself found quarters at Lord
Exeter's house, at the end of Full Street.

Levies and exactions in the name of
King James " were the order of the night
and of the morrow, but of these Sybil was
ignorant. She saw little of Hugh or of his
cousins, until drum and bagpipe summoned
her with the rest to All Saints' Church at
six in the evening to hear the young army
chaplain preach, as he had preached to
them in the Old Church, Manchester.
There was rest and repose for her in
the service until the fiery eloquence of
Thomas Coppock roused and excited her.
He has the fiery zeal of a martyr," she
whispered to Hugh, little thinking how
many martyrs were gathered under that
sacred roof, martyrs to a hopeless cause.

It was a sermon to inspire flagging and

drooping men ; for even on that Thursday
night there were doubts and fears in the
breasts of many that the projected encampment
on Finchley Common would never be
reached. The people did not rise as expected.
French and Welsh levies did not
appear ; and on the morrow dissatisfaction
reached a climax; even sanguine Hugh
advocating retreat before Kine George's
forces rendered it impossible.

After a solemn council of war, " retreat "
was the word. And if advance meant
discomfort, what must retreat have meant.

Manchester was entered in very different
array and spirits on Monday the 9th.
There was no cordial reception from even
a section of the community. The wise
and merciful policy of the chief merchants
alone prevented hostilities and loss of life ;
they were harassed and pelted by the mob
as they went ; and had not Sybil been a
good horsewoman she would never have
kept her seat and guarded her boy, her
steed, though jaded was so harried.

Such a revolution had set in that even

John Coppock, the tailor, was almost afraid
to receive his sons and the Furnivals
under his roof, and refused point-blank to
take charge of Sybil and her child, whom
Hugh was not only anxious to leave in
safety, but had begun to feel burdensome.

Something of this she had seen in Derby,
when the difficulty to obtain quarters for
the officers' wives had disconcerted him ;
their after discomfort, no less than his own,
and the fretful restlessness of his boy stung
him to irritability, and he blamed her
angrily for her inability to " keep Charlie
quiet."

During the hurried retreat she had seen
little of her husband, and when she did
there was little comfort to be p-iven. Footsore
and weary with the hasty march, he
was scarcely disposed for sympathy with
the fatigue of one on horseback, and the
sorrow he expressed for bringing wife and
child into such straits was as much for
himself as for them.

Loth as Sybil was to separate from her
husband, all the mother spoke within her

when John Coppock, having refused more
than temporary shelter, she went with her
boy in her arms through the rabble in the
streets, to seek a home with the Barons,
whilst Hugh went on with the troops.

Compassionate enough was Mrs Byrom,
but her answer was, '''' I dare not ! Byrom
will have to flee and hide himself. If I
were known to harbour and shelter the wife
and child of what they call ' a rebel ' in
arms, I should bring destruction on ourselves.
/ dare not, my dear, for the sake
of my own daughter and our home, much
as I feel for you both."

Then there is nothing for us but to pfo
forward," said Sybil despondingly, "and
hope for the best. But I fear we shall
be a sorry drag on Hugh, and how poor
little Tom will bear the cold and wet, I
know not ! "

What would the young wife have given
now for a father's heart and home to flee
to for comfort and shelter ? The recollection
of the abundant stores and warm
fireside she had wilfully foregone seemed

to mock her misery. How often did Dame
Furnival's harsh proverb recur to her.

She was finding the bed she had made
for herself woefully hard.

Pass we briefly over the hurried, anxious,
miserable retreat from Manchester to Car-isle
in the bitterest mid-winter, through
towns and villages where the populace were
either openly hostile, or afraid to show
favour or compassion — for it had come
to that.

Sybil was no modern fine lady. She
had been accustomed to brave the weather,
but not privation, and both had to be met ;
and, though a good horsewoman, had not
been trained to keep in a saddle day after
day, with barely an intermission ; nor yet
to carry a child fifteen months old on her
lap, huddled up in her cloak.

There was a halt and a day's rest on the
1 eth at Preston, whilst compulsory levies
were made on the inhabitants, or she would
have given in utterly.

She was too proud to complain, whilst
not only her dear Hugh, but women and

children marched on foot with shoes so
worn that people on the route were robbed
of theirs to supply the need. And what
became of the weariness of riding, when
first one and then another dropped out of
the line of march to perish of cold, hunger,
and fatigue by the wayside ; and strong
men fought and contended for the horses
of others.

No one was heard to envy the Prince
the black horse he bestrode ; but many a
covetous Dance and word was fluor on
S)billa and her black horse, with its one
white stocking hidden in mud.

Once or twice she voluntarily dismounted
to give a more weary mother a lift, and
she offered the like to Hugh and the Rev.
Thomas Coppock ; but the lieutenant said
he must march with his men, and the
chaplain that it was not for the soldier of
Christ to seek his own ease.

But the retreat had become a flight. Not
only was the small army of Highlanders
and English harassed by Georgian Rangers
as they fled, but the ruthless Duke of Cumberland

was following; fast with an overwhelming
force.

There came a rumour from the south
that the Pretender's French ales had
landed on the coast. It was a new aspect
of affairs, and the Duke stopped abruptly
for assurance.

It was only a brief respite, but a massacre
was doubtless saved ; and the followers of
Charles Edward, utterly worn out in crossing
the Westmoreland Fells, had thereby
a chance to bivouac at Slap. Few were
the cottages, and there was no place in
them for Sybil.

The ruined walls of an old abbey were
their only shelter from the bleak and cutting
north winds. Yet there, by such a fire as
soldiers make where wood is plentiful, she
accepted thankfully the coarse morsel of
food obtainable, fed her ravenous boy, and,
with him in her arms, slept on a wisp of
straw, with the sky for a canopy. Fatigue
was stronger than fear or caution, and
Hugh slept likewise.

There is a blast from the bagpipes. Up,

sleepers, up ! The Duke is again on the
march ; there is no time for slumber or
delay. Delicate women or hardy men must
alike be on the move. And now it is a
panic !

But where is Chevalier ? Stolen whilst
his owners slept !

There was no seeking the horse in the
skurry. The wife of the lieutenant and
of the private were on a level now ; she
must foot it with the rest, and be thankful
she had good shoes to her feet for the
tramp before her.

Ten miles of the rudest road, and
Egmont Bridge was crossed and Penrith
gained. But there was no pause. Terror
gave her strength to carry her boy, who
whimpered now and then, but never cried
aloud. Cold and hunger and fatigue had
overmatched the little one's strength and
spirit.

Eighteen more miles before them ere
they could reach the stronghold they
sought, whilst the roar of artillery and the
rattle of musketry in their rear were telling

how the brave Macpherson were laying
down their Ives to give them a chance to
make good their retreat.

And now across the cultivated plain the
battlemented towers of Carlisle cathedral
and castle loomed in the distance, on the
high hill-tops, through the morning mist,
and hope awoke again, though every mile
seemed three to weary, blistered feet.

And now the English gate is open, andover
the bridges and up the hill stream the
motley and ragged regiments, and Sybil
whispers to her boy, —

Now, Tom, we are safe. We can rest
at last." — Safety and rest ! Ah, me !

Carlisle was about as well prepared for
this second visitation of Charles Edward's
army as any other garrison town with a
roomy castle in its midst could be ; yet, for
all that, the inhabitants had to turn out of
their beds to supply the more urgent needs
of the newcomers.

Sybil did not trouble herself whence
it came when she lay down on one of the
requisitioned beds in the castle itself, with

VOL. I. H

little Tom in her arms. She could only
think that the strong walls of the city and
of the castle lay between them and their
foes.

She resigned herself to repose with a
delicious sense of security, and slept long.
With some ado Hugh obtained from the
bao^o-aore a change of raiment for his wife
and boy ; and, after a sadly-needed wash,
she felt refreshed and cheerful.

The child, too, laughed, and in its formless
speech expressed its satisfaction.

Yet, even then, a council of war was
being held on which hung the balance of
fate.

Lord George Murray — he who had
driven back the English advance at Clifton
in the darkness of the night to cover the
retreat — he counselled the abandonment of
Carlisle and the destruction of the castle,
but other counsels prevailed ; and Colonel
Townley, with many an oath, in his excess
of loyalty vowed that he and his Manchester
regiment would hold Carlisle for King
James, until Prince Charles should return

with reinforcements to relieve him of his
trust.

There was a sharp debate, but the voluntary
sacrifice was accepted. And a
sacrifice it was — or blind infatuation.

Deeply touched with this devotion,
Charles Edward at once appointed Colonel
Townley, Governor, and nominated the
chaplain, Thomas Coppock, Bishop of
Carlisle.

Then, after an address to the assembled
garrison, the Prince, who had led his army
in at the English gate on the 19th, left
Carlisle by the Scotch gate on the 21st,
and his army with him — not all, some few
Highlanders and Lowlanders and French
were left to strengthen Colonel Townley's
forlorn hope. A forlorn hope indeed !
The Manchester regiment had shrunk and
dwindled before Lancashire was traversed,
and the whole garrison left to hold the city
against veteran troops did not far exceed
three hundred men. Three hundred men !
So many were the Spartans at Thermopylae
!

THE PHANTOM SPINNER.

HE new Governor depended on

the strength of the city walls

and the Duke of Cumberland's

want of artillery, Alas ! the

walls were old and decaying, and the

vigorous Duke obtained artillery from

Whitehall.

Until then Lieutenant Furnival had
shared the sanguine faith of his more experienced
colonel, and had represented to
Sybil that city and castle were all but impregnable
; and she, only too thankful to
rest her exhausted limbs day after day,
was well content to watch the gambols of

her boy, and kiss his father for the glad
assurance. Nay, she laughingly held up
Tom's little feet and one of her own, and
asked if it was not time they had new shoes.

In reply, Hugh drew forth his pocketbook,
and handed to her a bank-note, with
the admonition to be careful.

She looked up in his face with surprise.
When had Hugh been " careful," or
suggested care to her ! But as he closed
his pocket-book, she remarked its diminished
bulk, and wondered how much remained
therein.

And then as he turned to oro, she looked
at the note in her hand. It was for twenty
pounds, the lowest issued at that period.

Stifling a sigh, she dressed herself and
boy, and, taking the little toddler by the
hand, went forth from the castle in search
of a cordwainer.

Her own wants were the sorest, and
soonest supplied, but then came a difficulty
about the bank-note, on which the man of
leather and vanstone fixed a rueful stare.

** Have you no change ? " asked Sybil.

Ou, ay ; bud happen bank's broken ! "

Rumours of the run on the Bank of England
must have reached Cumberland, and
the shoemaker stroked his bristly chin and
scratched his red head long before he produced
his bag of guineas and counted out
her change, minus half-a-guinea for the
risk he ran.

The half-guinea seemed less to Sybil
^/len than the supply of her immediate
needs, and she went on, carrying her boy,
to make one or two other purchases for
Hugh's comfort as well as theirs, in which
two or three of the guineas melted.

Wool and knitting-pins were amongst
the things she bought, and then she sat
down in tolerable content to knit warm
hose for her husband and child.

The calm was but the prelude to the
storm.

On the 27th, the dreaded Duke began to
batter down the crumbling walls in answer
to Colonel Townley's refusal to surrender.

On the 31st, the hopeless garrison Ad
surrendered. The only terms granted

being that the rebels should be reserved
for the king's pleasure — not put to the
sword.

At the sound of the first gun, Sybil's
heart had sunk within her. She had
snatched up Tom, and would have flown
in quest of Hugh, but — "orders were peremptory
that the ladies must keep to their
quarters," There, shut in out of sight,
but not of hearing, they crowded together,
adding to each other's terror. Only the
new bishop came to their relief, and told
the progress of the siege, and strove to
cheer them with his own bright faith.

When Hugh came, with white and weary
face, all was over.

*' My love," said he, with a sob, as he held
her and Tom clasped in a close embrace,
"they will not, cannot harm you, but they
will separate us, and — oh, I was surely
mad to plunge you into this misery ! —
there is no time to lose, you must quit the
castle, and seek shelter in the town."

I will not leave you," she said, with
mournful resolution, clinging to him in

agony. " I am punished for leaving my
father, but I will not quit you in your
extremity."

She had no choice. The castle was ransacked.
The frightened women, robbed
of their valuables, were driven by the
brutal soldiery into the castle-yard, to behold
their nearest and dearest stripped of
watches, rings, money, uniforms, shoes, and
pinioned together like malefactors, driven
half-clad through the streets in coarse derision
to the cathedral on the opposite hill,
with the new Bishop of Carlisle at their
head to " lead his flock."

Blows and hideous jests were not spared,
and Sybil thought her brain would have
turned, as Tom, stretching out his little
arms, shrieked " dada " to his father, who
was struck with the butt-end of a firelock
for turning his head to reply.

A poor widow, finding her fainting on a
doorstep, with the child crying in alarm,
took compassion on them and gave them
shelter.

There was no communicating with the

prisoners huddled together, half-naked, in
the cold cathedral. Sybil could only-wait,
and wait, and strive to still her throbbing
pulses by some active work.

It so happened that Widow Fell got her
living by spinning wool. Sybil set down
her boy on the floor, took her place at the
wheel, and stepping to and fro, on and off
the treadle, kept it in motion, and from the
tuft of wool at her waist spun so fine a
yarn that the widow could only look on in
wonder.

Ten busy days and restless nights, and
then there was a stir throughout the city.
The cathedral doors were thrown open,
and the prisoners brought forth.

The Rev. Thomas Coppock and several
of the Highlanders were marched across
the town to the castle, there to abide the
rebels' doom.

But Sybil, with the hood of her cloak
drawn over her gipsy hat, and her boy in
her trembling arms, watched only, with
gasping breath, for Hugh — her Hugh.

And she saw him, but with the rest of

the officers on horseback, with legs tied
together underneath the girth, and arms so
pinioned that he could barely hold the reins.
As for the poor privates, they were strung
together with ropes, and driven forth on
hopeless feet.

Sybil pressed forward to exchange a
parting word with Hugh, but was roughly
driven back ; and she could only shriek his
name, as the mounted dragoons, with flashing
swords, kept back the crowd, and led
their ill-clad prisoners away through the
English gate, the head of one horse tied to
the tail of the former.

There was no rest for Sybil now, she
must follow — but whither .-*

The compassionate widow, well known in
the town, ascertained that Colonel Townley
and one or two others were bound to
London,

London ! And no horse, and little
money, and my boy to carry. Oh ! what
shall I do ?" and she wrunor her hands in
helpless impotence.

The thoughtful widow came to her aid.

T' roads are dangerous for meddles.
You must goo as a pair boddie. Strap t'
lad on yer back, and tak a basket wi' summit
t' eat o' t' road, an' knit as yo goo
along. T' fwoak at farms '11 gie yo bite
an' sup ; an' yo can pay weel for lodging'
wi' a spell at th' spinning-wheel."

She would take no coin in payment for
her service or the shelter she had afforded.
She said she had had a lesson in spinning
which would repay her all her life through.

Ah, my friend," said Sybil, " your
wheel has been my safeguard. But for
that I think I should have gone mad."

The woman took the proffered guinea,
but only to get it changed and buy a
basket and so forth.

Then, professing to have herself an
errand out of the town, she took up a
huge bundle of yarn, as if for a weaver,
and bearing Sybil company, managed to
get her out through the guarded city gate.

Happen turf-cutters here and there '11
gie t' lad a ride in t' panniers ; or yo may
get a lift i' t' stage waggon. But cinna

show t' colour on your money an' yo can
help."

And so, with tears and thanks, they
parted, Sybil with a load on her back
and in her breast, and the length of England
to traverse on foot.

Of the dangers of the road she had
heard, but hardly knew. She soon found
that her occupation and her poverty were
her security. Though more than once
when her pockets were searched, and
found almost empty, she had trembled for
their lives, yet was she allowed to pass unharmed.
And though she rarely got a
better bed than a litter of straw or a nook
in a hayloft, she seldom found hospitality
denied. Her offer to pay for accommodation
by the work of her hands won her
respect even where it was rejected. Here
and there she was allowed to rest more
than a night ; her manners, her sorrowful
beauty, her early motherhood, winning
favour with some, though from others they
brought down only scorn and reviling.
Occasionally she got a lift for her boy, or

both of them, on a packhorse, or in a cart
or a stage-waggon ; for the last by payment.


But she learned to be sparing of her coin.
In the country it was seldom needed ; the
bowl of milk, the hunch of bread, the scrap
of cake were freely given.

In towns it was otherwise. There she
had to pay, or be treated with contumely
as a strolling vagabond. Yet was she afraid
to touch her hidden store, the first tradesman
to whom she had offered a guinea
having roundly accused her of theft, so
little did her appearance justify its possession.
Her tears and what she told of her
pitiful story to save herself from the watch-house
disarmed the baker, who changed
her coin, and bade her show no more of
the colour if she valued her freedom or
her life, for the roads swarmed with
footpads.

That was at Lancaster, under the very
shadow of John Gaunt's castle, where the
man himself a Jacobite, told her in a whisper
several of the rebels were then imprisoned.

There, too, she obtained certain information
that Hugh and his colonel had been
carried farther south ; and the man, as
respectful as he had been harsh, recommended
her to a decent lodmno- for the
night, and freed her a stage in the waggon
next day.

After that, she depended more on the
mittens and hose she knitted. At first she
had found Tom such a load on her back
that she could scarcely use her knitting-pins,
but necessity and a little time made it
easier. Then she set him down to stretch
his limbs and run by her side betimes.

And so she went forward after her unfortunate
husband — in what hope or fear
she hardly knew herself — wounded to the
core by the brutal jests on the rebels and
their probable fate which everywhere fell
on her ears, and enduring hardships, indignities,
and anguish, of which she could
only thank God her little son could know
nothing. He could feel hunger and inclement
weather, but, to the best of her poor
ability, she guarded him from them.

She reached London at last. But she
found the walls of Newgate harder, colder,
and more pitiless than the weather. Grim,
grey, and unresponsive they rose between
her and Hugh,

Yet scarcely harder, colder, or more pitiless
than the strange city in which she stood
homeless in the month of March, with few
coins about her, a name she dared not own,
a helpless child to keep, and no means
of support but her knitting-pins. What
wonder if visions of the far-off Oaklandss,
its glowing fires, cushioned chairs, rich
clothing, appetising viands, floated before
her, and smote her with self-reproach, as
she staggered away from the prison gate,
refused admission, and not knowing whither
to turn for hope or shelter !

Was this all for which she had forsaken
father and home ^.

• ••••«••

The fields of Cheshire were ripened
unto harvest, kine were lowing in the pastures,
sickles were sharpened for the rustling
corn, the flaunting poppies nodded

carelessly, orchards bent beneath their
load of fruit, in the dairies churns and
cheese-presses were full and at work.

Another harvest was being gathered in.

In the great kitchen of the Oaklandss,
where the rows of pewter platters and
dishes shone like silver against the whitewashed
wall, and the wooden bowls and
trenchers were ranged, as fresh and clean
and tempting, Ursula — fat, fussy, and self-important,
as she thought it behoved her
to be — watched a preserving-kettle hanging
from a crane over the hot fire on the
open hearth in the huge chimney, alternately
wiped the moisture from her forehead
and scolded the younger maids, who
were stripping currants and shelling broad
beans, and whispering low their wonder,
What would become of poor Mrs Fur-rival
? "

Out in the grounds the master of the
Oaklandss stalked moodily to and fro ; now
slowly, as if lost in thought ; now hurriedly,
and with a sort of fierce light in his eye,
and a grip of his closed hand, as if ani



enemy was crushed within it. At such
times he held his head erect as of yore,
but his shoulders had contracted a perceptible
stoop, and his hair was no longer
black, but iron-grey.

There was a sound of hoofs in the lane,
a pull at the great bell of the closed gate ;
Josh hobbled round the corner of the house
to open it, and Mr Venables, who had
crossed the bridge he had built for Sybil's
convenience, turned back and stood with
one hand upon the parapet to await his
visitor,

Well, what news ? " said he, as Squire
Gerard came towards him, with a curious
expression on his long, melancholy visage.

News ? Terrible news, I call it. The
rebels in London have been tried, and
their leaders executed — barbarously."

They were traitors, and deserved their
punishment," said Mr Venables sternly.

Ay, punishment if you will, but not
torture ! The horrid sight killed Jemmy
Dawson's sweetheart, poor lass ! I saw
the heads of Townley and Deacon spiked

VOL. I. I

atop of the Manchester Exchange yesterday."


And what of—"

Gerard filled up the pause, —

Furnival ? — he is one of those reserved
for transportation."

The traitor ! they should have hanged
him too ! " and Thomas Venables set his
teeth on the words,

The blow will fall heavily enough on
her as it is," said his gentler companion
sadly ; then adding, as he drew a soiled
letter from his pocket, " I found this lying
at the ' Unicorn' as I came through Walsingham
this morning. It is from London,
from—"

Then let it fall ! she cast in her lot with
traitors, and deserves no pity ! "

As the words burst from the inflexible
old man, his glance fell on the superscription
of the letter. For a moment his hand
shook, and his face paled.

Then the unread missive was torn hastily
up into shreds, and cast forth over the
water.

The breeze blew pieces of the paper
back. One fell at Gerard's feet, another
on the stone parapet of the bridge, close to
his hand. A word or two caught his eye.

He started, picked up the scrap at his
feet, regardless of ceremony.

Snow Hill, Lord — " was upon it.

"If your love has turned to gall, mine
has not,' he said, in bitter reproach ;
Sybil stands in sore need of a friend,
and she shall at least have one. I shall
start for London ere daybreak tomorrow
Josh, my horse."

His horse was brought back. His foot
was in the stirrup.

Have you no word for her ? "

There was no answer. Gerard galloped
off, with a face as set and determined as
the one he had left behind, but it was set
to a kinder purpose.

The harvests of rebellion had been
reaped on the field and on the gallows.

The harvests of Cheshire had been garnered
; geese feasted amid the stubble ;

the aftermath was mown and stacked ;
the potatoes dug on Bowdon Downs ; the
hazel nuts in Wood Lane tempted the village
boys ; beech and oak were dropping
mast and acorns within the precincts of
the Oaklandss ; leaves — yellow, red, brown
hung limp upon the trees, or, crisp and
sear, littered the pathways, and driving
before the wind, tapped at the windows of
the house, whose master, sitting alone by
his fireside, had a something tapping at his
breast, just as the leaves tapped on the panes
and conscience was the driving wind.

Walking moodily through his own
meadow that afternoon, he had looked
over the hedge, where it skirted Wood
Lane, to rebuke some children who were
roughly tearing down the brambles to
gather the ripe blackberries. He knew
them for the younger children of Barnes,
the weaver ; but in their midst stood a
white - headed ragged urchin some two
years old, who looked up at him with
large blue eyes, and a mouth all stained
with the fruit.

That face was haunting him as he sat by
the fire at eventide, with his book of philosophy
unread — sat until the moon rose,
and the bats came out and flapped against
the casement louder than the leaves.

Why did it haunt him so ?

Such a child might have been Sybil's
had she borne one ! — and they called it
Tom'' whispered conscience.

Gerard has not returned. I have
neither friend nor child by my hearth.
Might I not have had child and grandchild
both, had I been more forofivino- ? "

And so conscience tapped, as there he
sat, the shadows deepening around him,
the curtain undrawn, no candles lit.

In the bright kitchen, Ursula sat instate
in her blue camlet gown and farthingale,
directing the maids, who were
busy sorting damsons for wine, picking
stray leaves from elder berries, and preparing
the evening meal. Josh, with a dog
at his feet, and a red handkerchief over
his head, sat dozing by the fire. Candles
in tall mahogany silver-mounted candlesticks

stood unllghted on a waiter, with
snuffers and tray by their side.

"Strange, master has not rung for his
candles," said one.

"Hush!" exclaimed another, in a frightened
whisper. " There it is again ! Don't
you hear it ? "

Hear it ! the dog heard it, and Josh
heard it and wakened up ; and Ursula
heard it, and clasping her hands, uttered
a pious ejaculation in her fear.

God save us all ! there it is again :
Miss Sybil's wheel going hard and
fast, and her door locked, and her faraway."


'• Ay, it be Miss Sybil's wheel, sure
enoof," put in Josh. " What be op ? "

An' this be th' third time ween heard
it," cried a girl.

Summit's happened to th' young
misses, an' yon's her ghost ! " said Josh,
in an oracular whisper.

The musical hum of the wheel was
certainly clear and distinct as a song.
Silence fell on the white-faced listeners.

I wonder if master hears it ? " asked
one, below her breath.

Master, he seems to hear nowt, nowadays,"
muttered the old man.

A bell rang.

There's master ringing for his candles,"
cried Ursula.

But no one stirred. And still was heard
the monotonous hum-m-m-m.

Again rang the library bell. In fear
three maids together threaded the passages
with the lighted candles. Nothing was
to be heard at the library door, and no one
dared speak of Sybil's spinning-wheel to
their master.

The servants were afraid to go about
the house alone, or to pass the door of the
deserted room, on their way to bed, for the
drone of the wheel did not cease. And it
drove sleep from their pillows.

Mr Venables used the other stairs, and
heard nothing more than what he took for
the sighing of the wind.

Night by night the sound was heard ;
only on the Sabbaths was it silent.

Rumour went abroad that the house was
haunted. The timid maids at length refused
to pass the doors of Sybil's rooms
on their way to bed, and Ursula was no
more courageous. They preferred sleeping
as best they could on tables and settles in
the kitchen ; Ursula took possession of a
guest-chamber near her master's ; Josh
resumed his abandoned quarters above the
stables.

Only Mr Venables, occupied with his
own thoughts, walked about in unalarmed
ignorance ; yet even he was conscious of a
mysterious something in the air of his
household and of the village ; and he
began to speculate why Gerard did not
return.

Now and again he encountered the same
little fellow in the lanes with others, poorly
clad, but no longer in rags ; and once or
twice he stooped and stroked the child's
white head, and gave him a silver groat.
But he only went back to his solitary
hearth more moody and silent.

And still from twih'oht until dawn the

wheel was heard to hum-mem ; and whispers
went abroad of a mysterious figure
like Miss Sybil (always Miss Sybil)
seen in the dim light to flit under the dark
shadows of yews and evergreens and over
the bridge, and to carry a bundle with her,
as she must have done when she fled.

There was only one opinion, that she
was dead, and her unquiet spirit could not
rest — unforeseen.

With the coming of December came
back Squire Gerard.

In every line of his melancholy face was
seen disappointment.

He sat down in his old place, opposite to
Mr Venables, wearily.

He thought he saw a look of expectation
in the old man's face, and he noted that
his hair had become white as snow,

I have no tidings. No one bearing; the
name of either Furnival or Venables had
been heard of in Snow Hill. I tried
Southwark, whither the prisoners had
been removed, thinking she might have
followed her unfortunate husband ; but

though I heard of a poor, torn-down
wretch, who had shrieked out ' Hu^jh ' as
the prisoners were driven on board the
transport, I could find no trace of her, high
or low ; and I fear we never shall. God
help her!"

With his head bent low, his hands
clasped between his knees, Mr Venables
had listened in silence. But Gerard saw
his shoulders heave, and his whole frame
convulse with strong emotion.

Gerard made no stay. As Josh went
with him to open and secure the outer
gate, he told in awe-stricken tones how the
house was haunted, and the servants afraid
to stay.

Master heard the wheel himsel' last
week ; but he swore some on us weer
plain' him a trick, and only last night as
was, he nailed up th' door as shuts off them
rooms, and with his own hands, while th'
carry wheel wer buzzing its loudest. He
said he'd silence the spinner ; no tricks
should be played in his house. But lor,'
Squire, th' wheel went on just th' same."

Gerard rode away thoughtfully. He
was not without a tinge of the superstition
of the time ; and what he had heard but
confirmed his fears that his dearly-loved
Sybil was no more.

The morning, crisp and keen, saw him
once more at the Oaklandss.

He found the owner in the grounds
giving orders for the filling up of a gap
in the hedge that separated the meadow
from Wood Lane, and looking haggard,
though composed.

They strolled together by the water side,
talking of various matters ; but no sooner
were they out of earshot than Gerard adverted
to the rumour he had heard.

A dastardly trick, sir," cried the old
gentleman, through the ashen pallor of his
lips. "It was a sorry time and a sorry
jest to play on a childless man. But I've
silenced the wheel ; there was no spinning
last night."

But, sir—"

What further Gerard would have said
was cut short.

A little blue eyed child, coming through
the gap in the hedge, ran across the
meadow to meet them, followed at a distance
by Barnes the weaver.

"What 00 done wi' my mammy, grandad?
Mammy, 'at tum'to 'pin ? What 00 done
wi' mammy ? ' almost shrieked the little fellow
between his sobs.

Gerard gazed at the child, and then at
Mr Venables, who seemed struck dumb asa
statue.

I want my mammy ! " began the child
again.

"MrsFurnival, mester," explained Barnes
apologetically as he came up, ' she cam' op
here to spin i' th' noight-toime t' keep her
sen an' th' little chap ; an we hanna seen
her sin — "

A hoarse cry burst from the old man.
Flinging his arms wildly in the air, he
rushed over the bridge, and through the
court-yard, towards the house. But Gerard
was before him, armed with a gardener's
pick he had caught up by the way.

At the very back of the splintered door

they found Sybil prostrate with hunger,
cold, exhaustion, and despair.

For the first time Gerard's arms enfolded
her, and he bore her swiftly to the warmth
and life below, insensible, but living.

Kisses from little lips did almost as much
as Ursula's cordials to restore her.

She opened her eyes to see Tom on her
father's knee ; to feel her hand within that
father's clasp ; to hear his fervent " Thank
God ! she revives ! I have not killed my
darling ! " And, as in a dream, a soothing
sense of home, forgiveness, peace stole
into her soul, though her eyelids drooped
again.

Later, she had a hazy consciousness of
Gerard watching her with shaded eyes from
behind her father's chair, and of Ursula
and others hovering near.

And she heard, still dreamily, the voice
of Barnes as he related how he had found
her one stormy afternoon in October, sitting
half-dead with cold, want, and fatigue, on
Baguley Moor, huddled up to keep the lad
on her lap from the rain. He took her fora

beofSfar ; but he could not leave her to
perish. He chanced to have in his poke
some cake and elderberry wine, given him
at the Hall, where he had been with a web
of homespun. They helped the poor
creatures round, so that when he took
the lad she could just drag herself to
his cottage, where his missus set up a
shout, and called him a "thick-yet" for
not knowing who he'd brought home. It
was a poor shelter for such as she ; but
'twas better than none. And whatever
they had done for her, they had been paid
both beforehand and since, through Billy
and her spinning.

That neither Thomas Venables nor
Squire Gerard thought so, the humane
weaver and his family had ample proof
in the aftertime.

From Sybil herself they learned how
she had slipped in from the court-yard
before the doors were barred for the night,
and how, on findings her sittings-room door
locked, she passed through the open landing
door, found her bedroom door beyond

2/;^locked, and so had the range of both.
She had made use of her old wardrobe as
well as of the wheel, thus adding unconsciously
to the delusion of the ghost. She
had resorted to her wheel as a means of
support, and to relieve her preservers of
an extra burden. She had occupied by
day a bed they used by night ; and their
humble cot had been a peaceful haven.
Nothing could repay them.

There were sighs and self-reproaches on
both sides. Mrs Leicester and the Furnish
came in for their share of blame ;
but though Sybil expressed contrition for
her wilfulness and disobedience, and confessed
that she had soon found her ill-advised
marriage a mistake, she avoided
reference to Hugh. Her wifely love and
sorrow were sacred.

She was at home, at rest. The love of
her boy and his grandfather was hers ; the
friendship of Gerard — of whose fruitless
quest she had heard ; but there was still
the canker of grief at her heart, and neither
love nor friendship could overcome the

Sybil.

effects of anguish and privation in her
wanderings.

They laid her to rest in the spring, and
Sybil's Spinning Wheel was silent forevermore.


In eighteen months Thomas Venables
lay by his daughter's side, and little Tom
was left as a sacred trust to the squire. At
least so he regarded his executorship ; and,
when he died in fulness of years, " Gerard
of Riddingss, last of his name and race,"
was inscribed on his tomb. He had
never married.

CHAPTER I.

ON THE BRIDGE.

F all sleepy country towns, surely
Sandwich, on the Kentish coast,
is the very drowsiest. Let us
admit it is, at the same time,
one of the cleanest.

On the hottest summer day the quaint
irregular buildings spread cool shadows
over the narrow streets, where Progress
fell asleep more than two centuries agone,
and never prince or peer with magic kiss
has wakened her again. The very wasps

VOL. I. K

and flies seem to have forsaken the spot ;
the few that Anger float about as if imbued
with the universal somnolence, not
daring to disturb the repose of the people
by buzzing and humming too busily.

Few are the carts or carriages rumbling
through the streets to break their silence
save on the market days ; no seamstress
sits by the open window to look out ; no
eager young faces peer over blinds ; there
is nothing new to be seen, nothing to be
expected. Besides, respectability forbids
vulgar curiosity ; and the whole place is
eminently respectable, as a small town,
ruled by a mayor and corporation, and
the clergy of three churches, and boasting
two foundation hospitals and a grammar
school, must be as a matter of course,
even though the venerable grammar school

o o

be neglected in its dotage, a building only,
without a master and without scholars.
You may see grass in the thoroughfares,
but no beggars and no rags.

When the womenkind do their shopping,
or their visiting, is a puzzle for the

speculative. They do not meet or jostle
on the narrow footpaths ; do not flutter
their finery before admiring throngs ; —
there is no one to admire.

Of late years, a railway, passing the
town at a respectful distance on the
western border, has brought a something
of vitality, under cover of modern
brick and stucco, to the suburb ; and now
and then a train may land there an adventurous
visitor from bustling Deal, or an
inquisitive antiquary, fresh from Rich-borough,
may stray thither to pore into the
recesses of its ancient churches, examine
its gateways, and other relics of the past,
in order to establish some historic fact, or
knock down some opponent's theory. Or,
maybe, an artist, with a love for the
antique, lounging lazily through his holiday,
strolls past the new villa residences
with scarcely a lifted eyelid, and coming
fresh upon the quaint old place, falls
straightway in love with its " cool tones,"
the picturesque buildings thronging its
winding ways, with here an arch of ancient

masonry, there an overhanging window ina
high-pitched gable, or a front of overlapping
plank, relics of the past both in
churches and quiet nooks, and so, being
dreamily inclined, may be beguiled into a
brief sojourn there until Sandwich, as he
sees it, finds its way into his portfolio in
sketches of still life.

For, of the active life of Sandwich in
its palmy days, before the sand silted up
and the sea retired, when it was chief of
the Cinque Ports, and furnished its quota
of war-ships to the king in his need, the only
memory lies outside the ancient Fisher-gate,
and the Barbican, amongst the line of
old warehouses and wharves on the waterside,
where still a few schooners, and other
vessels of broad build and light draught
load and unload, or across the river Stour
and the long swing bridge, where a clink
of hammers in a shipbuilder's yard (backed
by rapidly disappearing green woods),
mayhap gives token that the black hull of
some damaged schooner or lugger is undergoing
repair.

Such was the case a few years before
the railway hove in sight, when just such
a stroller, dressed in a loose blouse, and
with one of the newly-introduced soft felt
hats upon his head, turned his back alike
upon the smooth dusty road trending towards
Ramsgate, and on the verdure of
sward or shrubbery on either hand, and,
propped against the trunk of a tall elm
near the bridge (one of a line, skirting the
road), sketched bridge and Barbican gateway
and surroundings, at his leisure, under
shadow of the foliage.

A vessel, newly-laden either at the great
Kent Brewery, or some other storage to
his right, was working its way down the
sandy Stour with the outgoing tide ; and
an old seafaring man or bridge-keeper,
pipe in mouth, leaned with both arms on
the parapet of the bridge, watching its
approach,

Now, if there was only a pretty girl oran
old woman to occupy the foreground,
the picture would be complete. The old
salt is all very well for the middle distance,"

said the artist to himself, as he put a fresh
dab of colour on his sketch, " but — "

As if conjured up by the wish, a young
girl, between fifteen and sixteen, wearing a
straw bonnet with an open brim, a clean
but well-washed printed frock, which fell
to her instep in full soft folds, and a small
shawl-handkerchief, laid lightly over her
shoulders, came along the sandy footpath,
under the shadow of the high hedge and
the wooden palisade of the shipyard, to
make her way over the bridge.

Hill ! here she is, by Jove! " almost
burst from the lips of the sketcher, as,
unobservant of him or his occupation,
she pursued her way, bearing an open
basket on her arm and a parcel in her
hands.

Now, if she would but stop and turn
her face. Egad, Pierce ! you are in luck's
way this morning. And, good heavens !
what a face, and what eyes under that
poor straw bonnet ! What lucky chance
swung the bridge open for that overgrown
barge to pass, just as she came up.

Pierce, my boy, you must make the most
of your moments,"

Oh, dear, what a pity I was not across
before the bridge was opened, I shall be
kept such a while ! " was the inaudible
ejaculation of the young girl, as the centre
of the bridge, answering some mechanical
leverage under command of its keeper,
swung back to let the approaching vessel
glide slowly through the gap, " I may as
well put my basket and parcel down, a hot
day like this," she further communed with
herself, as she deposited the flat open
basket at her feet, and laid the good-sized
paper parcel lightly on the top ; " it's best
to wait patiently. Mother would call this
stoppage ill luck, seeing the hurry I'm in.
But what's the use, as Mrs Rye says, of
making every small hindrance into a real
misfortune with grumbling, I catch myself
at it more than is o-ood for me. As
for poor mother, one needn't wonder if
her great misfortune does make her fret at
small ones. She never seems to get it
out of her mind. I wonder if ever — "

and here, as she rested against the stone
parapet of the bridge, with her Hghtly-
clasped hands hanging low before her,
thought wandered off in a haze of speculation
; her head uplifted, her large dark
eyes expanded dreamily, and she looked
across the bridge roadway and up the
river, seeing neither shipping nor warehouses,
nor trees, nor people, save those of
her own wonderland, and was only roused
at last by the noise the bridge-centre made
in its readjustment.

Meanwhile, crossing the open country
by the grass-grown Monk's Walk, a military
officer in undress had come upon the
scene. He was not apparently more than
three-and-twenty, slender for his height if
not for his years, with a face full of fire and
enthusiasm, of prompt decision and steadfast
purpose. He was clean shaven, but
there was a close crop of ruddy chesnut
curls under his military cap, and they had
sent their advanced lines down his fair
cheeks, as a protest against effeminacy.

Coming unheard over the thick grass, he

saluted the busy sketcher lightly, " So, my
knight of the brush, still at work ? How
long do — " and Captain Ainslie paused.

In stooping to take a sidelong glance at
the sketch, his gaze was attracted — not to
the picture of Sandwich harbour, but to a
face apart in a corner of the paper.

What wondrous eyes ! " he ejaculated,
Why Hathersage, my boy, that face will
make your fortune ! "

I've no objection. But hush. Captain,
or the owner may hear you," and Pierce
Hathersage looked up across the road
once more at his unconscious model.

She had heard only the clash of the
re-settling bridge. Involuntary was her
start, and slight, as was the sudden movement
of her head ; but it brought the tree
within range, and those beneath it.

In an instant she had picked up the
parcel and basket at her feet, and hurried
away over the bridge, and under the archway
of the Barbican Gate, with the crimson
flag of insulted modesty fluttering in
her face.

The momentary glimpse had revealed
two pairs of masculine eyes fixed upon
her ; and she needed no telling what the
sketch-book meant.

Ah ! modest as well as pretty, and
modesty eclipses beauty," exclaimed the
officer, as he watched her disappear under
the archway. "As rare a sample of a
Kentish maid as I have met. Poor, by
her garb. Alas ! for her, beauty and poverty
together form a dangerous heritage for a
girl. The interesting damsel bids fair to
play havoc with the hearts of despairing
swains when she grows to womanhood.
But rough labour and hard usage are
destructive to female charms, and at the
best she can but fall to the lot of some
clodhopper, tinker or tailor, incapable of
appreciating the prize he wins." And, ashe
spoke, a pair of shoulders that had not
as yet attained their full breadth, rose with a
significant shrug alike of contempt and pity.

"Nay, nay, Captain," argued the painter,
still working at the face whilst memory was
fresh, " I do not admit that. There are

poor men with as strong an appreciation
of beauty as the rich. Artistic taste maybe
cultivated, but the love of beauty is
innate ; witness the flowers flourishing in
broken crocks and blacking-bottles on 
in foetid alleys ; the botanists and
naturalists amongst our toiling masses ;
and of the painters, whose genius speaks
from the canvas of the past or present —
how many think you have been cradled in
the lap of luxury ? The girl may find a
husband in her own rank to love and admire
her as truly as any coroneted earl who weds
a reigning beauty. But, if I read aright,
those dreamy orbs hold no communion
with clodhopping.'

May be you are right ; every countryman
is not a Peter Bell ; and most likely
had we heard the rustic damsel speak, her
hroTkApatois would have dispelled the charm
of her marvellous eyes. But are you
ready ? And is that all you have to show
for a morning's work ? "

The artist was closing sketch-book and
colour-box. " I thought that face was to

make my fortune ! " said he, drily, with a
smile upon his lips. " And tJiat would
surely be a fair day's work. Yet, I have
something else to show. A sketch I took
from the centre of the bridge. Come with
me thither and compare the view with
this," and he presented his re-opened book
to the other.

See," he continued, with a nod of his
head towards the shipyard on their left,
I have brought that schooner's freshly-patched
black hull, and half the shipwright's
shed into the foreground, with just a fringe
of the overhanging Stonar shrubbery beyond
; and see, stretching far away into
the level distance, the meandering river
winding its tortuous way across the sandy
flats, with just a single sail to break the
monotony, and give life and emotion to the
silvery thread of river, the wide expanse of
reedy waste, and the faint line of sea on
the horizon. You see the river widens to
the forefront, where other craft lie moored
to wharves barely indicated on our right.
How like you it .-* "

Well, right well. The dappled sky,
the lights and shadows, have been admirably
caught for a sketch so slight, and the
perspective is beyond all praise. You
should make a fine picture from this. But,
I say, Hathersage, can your imagination
re-cover those flats with rolling billows,
and bring up to Sandwich Haven full
seas, in which the nation's fleet might
have safe anchorage ; or, going farther
back ere Sandwich was a port, can
you imagine what it was when the
galleys of Agricola made for the Haven ^.
We see only what lies before us, and
all the rest seems a myth, an old wife's
tale, and yet we cannot doubt that such
has been."

Ay, Captain, if I shut my eyes and
dream, I can see it all. See the painted
Briton's coracles before the Roman galley,
Elizabeth's cumbrous floating-castles, and
the old herring-fleets ; build up once more
the Priory, reinstate the abbot and set a
portcullis in Sandown Gate. Imagination
is the faculty of painter and of poet. We

see with the inner sense, and I much misdoubt
if history owes not half its charm to
the same faculty."

No doubt, no doubt," assented the captain,
with a light laugh. " But will your
fertile imagination set a luncheon before a
hungry man ? "

It has had to do so before to-day,"
quoth the other, with a peculiar something
in eye and lip ; " but I scarcely think the
famous fruit of Apelles would be as satisfactory
at this moment as a mouthful of
ordinary bread and cheese, with a glass of
Kentish ale to wash it down. We are not
likely to get anything better at a moment's
notice in this ' deserted village,' though its
inns be legion, but, if you are not dainty
regarding accommodation, here at the gate
is an ' ancient hostelry ' ready to welcome
us."

Ah ! the Bohemian instinct ! For my
own part, I should prefer a less ancient
flavour of salt and tar in ' mine inn,' but
as you will." And the captain looked up
at the long, low corner inn, where the one

upper-floor overhung the lower, with no
great favour.

The assent was given in answer to a
whispered suggestion, which Boniface,
chatting with the bridge-keeper in front of
his own door, might have overheard.

At all events, he gave a nod of intelligence
to the " old salt," as he turned
lead to the way through the low portals of
the " Crispin " to the sacred precincts of
the bar-parlour.

There was a smell of spirits and tobacco-smoke
about, but otherwise the room was
clean, cool, cosy, and private. Boniface
himself bustled about to supply their wants.

Well," said Captain Ainslie to his companion,
as he sat down in a round-backed
arm-chair, with an angular seat, " the shade
is at least refreshing after the hot sun, and
who knows but I may have to put up with
worse quarters and worse fare if Nicholas
and Menschikoft^ carry out their little programme
against ' the sick man.' I smell
sulphur and gunpowder in every despatch,
and all Europe is on the qui vives

Ay, ay," assented the other, holding a
tall glass of ale in his uplifted hand, " but
is a dismal anticipation of war and its discomforts
needed to olive a zest to nectar
such as this, after a long walk under a hot
sun ? / feel the need to fortify myself
against the six miles back. ' there's to
the face that is to make my fortune ! ' " and
when the glass was put down it was
empty.

Nay," amended the officer, " say rather,
To the modest Kentish Maiden, with the
wondrous eyes ! ' " and his own ale went
down without any wry face, though it was
not champagne.

As a reason for another class when I
have despatched the ambrosia men call
bread and cheese, I accept your toast,
Captain, though I have a weak leaning to
my own, for its sweet prophetic ring. If
I could find the girl, and cajole or bribe
her to give me a sitting, I should think I
had taken a step on that same road to fortune,
I'll have a try for it."

And fail. Nay, Hathersage, you must

be content to make a picture from the
sketch you have, and I will be the purchaser."


"All right. Step the first. Now for
step the second."

A tug at a primitive bell-pull brought
the landlord into the room so quickly that
he must have been pretty near at hand.
And if he had looked mysterious when he
ushered them into the room, he was doubly
so then. His ordinary manner was unknown
to his customers, so the change
passed muster, even to his hesitation over
the reckoning.

Do you know a Kentish damsel hereabouts
like that, or that ? " and the artist,
opening his book, pointed to a roughly-outlined
figure standing on the bridge, and
to the more finished face in the corner.

No more I don't. Dere be no Kent
maid anewst* Sandwich had de blot of dat.
Wull, she come from Ramsgate now ? " and
Boniface shook his head as if in utter
ignorance.

Anewst — nigh to. t Ably — look.

VOL. I. L

Outside, the artist tackled the bridge-keeper.
The man was quite as oblivious,
and had no memory to be stimulated by
silver shillings.

Nor had a couple of thirsty loiterers by
the inn-door.

Had the strangers, who avoided the
steep hill appropriately called the High
Street, but looked over their shoulders as
they crossed the road and turned into the
narrow thoroughfare at the back of the
river warehouses called Strand Street, with
their faces towards Knightrider Street and
Deal, they might have seen other faces at
the inn windows and at the door — gripped
hands and angry faces ; and Fine-ear's gift
might have told them they were taken for
foreign spies, and that all Barbican Gateway
exercised to learn why they wanted to
"cajole" or "bribe" '' Our Hetty T

THE HAVEN.

UR Hetty ! " Who was Hetty ?
And why did so many different
rough voices claim her as
ours ?'"

The ever-restless, cruel, and insidious
sea, the sea which, smiling, hides so much
and tells so little, which makes so much
work for geologists, and plays such pranks
with our coast line, which centuries ago
left historic Sandwich high and dry behind
a long stretch of sandy flats, very much
nearer to our own time, took the law into
its own strong wet hands, and, marching
with long strides up the shrinking beach,

closer and closer to Sandown Castle, built
on the bare coast between them and Deal,
at length took possession of the fortress,
almost within sight of useless Sandwiches.
Took possession, as any other powerful
enemy, to have and to hold at will, to work
destruction withal. The castle, with its
four rounded bastions, might have looked
over the Downs defiantly, as if mocking
Neptune's might too long ; and sometimes
with a whisper, and sometimes with a roar,
his challenge was proclaimed. The great
giant was weary of soft beds of sand, his
prey escaped too oft. He determined he
would have the castle, hard and firm as a
rock, to batter oak, or teak, or iron upon.
Let it stand there awhile to look picturesque
when tides were low and waves were
merciful, so long as it was ready to hand
when in his wrath he and the winds fought
together for men's lives.

More than eleven years before the sunny
day when " Our Hetty" stood waiting and
dreaming on Sandwich bridge, for the unsuspected
behoof of a wandering artist,

during the highest of hiQ;h tides, a terrible
tempest had burst upon the eastern coast,
bringing wreck and desolation.

Great masses of purple cloud had darkened
the sun at noon-day, and over the
Downs and the whole North Sea the
wildest of wild winds had come tearing
from the north-east and held a witches'
carnival. They beat and buffeted the sea
in scorn, and the furious waves rose in
their might to claw at the mocking winds
and driving rain ; and, failing impotently,
fell foul of all that was near and helpless in
their tremendous clutch. How many a
fishing-smack, how many a merchantman,
went down, or was disabled in that terrific
storm will never be revealed ! The Good-wins
are as silent as remorseless.

One, a fine, fast-sailing barque, well
manned and officered, laden with wine
and fruit from Lisbon, and bound for the
port of London, was caught in the swirl of
winds and waves, and, after a desperate
struggle for the mastery, was hurled
against the hard front of Sandown Castle

(then standing firm, and proud of its own
strength), as the first proof what they
meant to do hereafter.

There was terror in the castle and on
the shore at the invasion lone ere this
occurred, for the dungeons and the moat
had been filled by the tide ; now there
were shrieks from ship and shore, but
the shrieks of men and women were
lost in the shrieking of the blast, and
only blanched faces could tell the common
dread !

Back swept the imperious sea, and with
it swept the barque, her bows crushed, her
bulwarks shattered ; and then, as another
huge billow came rolling on, bent on destruction,
some supreme act of seamanship,
some derisive shifting of the wind, carried
her out of the huge triton's grasp, and sent
her reeling and tumbling out into the open
Downs.

Not to safety — that one blow against
Sandown walls forbade — only to doom ascertain.
Masts were snapped, cordage
rent, timbers riven, and the waters washing

in and rolling over, made a speedy end of
the fast-sailing barque Eureita."

What of her freight ? of the human lives
she had had in her keeping ?

Who could tell ? 'Twas not the only
barque that had gone to pieces in that
storm. Bodies were washed ashore and
reverently buried, casks of wine were found
afloat by the Deal boatmen in their stout
luggers and claimed as flotsam ; others,
drifted shorewards by the tide, in less frequented
spots, were broached where they
lay, without a scruple of ownership, and
wine was cheaper in seaside cottages than
milk or ale. Whilst, as if in mockery, for
many a day the waves played at ball with
oranges, and as they went bobbing up and
down, or tumbled in with the tide, lads and
lasses ran bare leQfcred into the surf to
rescue the golden fruit.

Those said brave and sturdy Deal boatmen
had gone forth, almost in the teeth of
the storm, to rescue life and property, and
earned the gratitude of many a thankful
soul. But their harvest did not end with

the storm. The sea was strewn with
wreckage, and amongst their many gleanings
was a painted figurehead ; a woman
with a sky-blue flowing robe, and her name
in golden letters on her belt — " Euretta."

A young military cadet from Sandhurst,
whose name was Paul Ainslie, happened to
be in Deal at the time. He had been at
once awed and fascinated by the storm ;
and all the following day he seemed to
haunt the shore in restless excitement, nowhere,
now there. Standing in the evening
on the spot whence a wooden pier was to
run four years later,. he watched the lugger
Saucy Jane come in with the figurehead
and other drift in tow.

Lad-like, he joined the curious crowd
upon the beach, as the entangled mass was
hauled up; the first cry being it was "a
drowned woman."

He it was who read the peculiar name
out aloud to them, whilst an old fisherman,
learned in his calling, but not in bookish
lore, spelled the letters slowly one by one,
and boggled at the word " Euretta."

There were officials busy on the beach
to whom the name and figurehead served
as a clue for communication with Lloyds'
and the luckless owners.

The boy, Paul Ainslie, listening to speculations
anent the Etiretta, her crew and
cargo, rolled the semi-classic word upon
his tongue, and carried it away with him
to Sandhurst, not to be foro-often whilst
the previous night of storm and wreck was
remembered ; and its impression was ineffaceable.


In the early light of morning, after the
wind had spent its fury, a broad, flat-keeled
vessel, built on the coast for the Dutch
trade, made its well-known way, after a
prolonged tussle with the spirits of the
storm, into the Sandwich Haven, when
any gayer craft, not Deal or Dutch built,
must have come to Pfrief on the sands.

Besides her carse of butter and cheese,
The Lass of Kent had on board a woman
and a child, found together alone and adrift
in an open boat.

When discovered, the woman was sitting

almost up to her knees in water that
threatened to swamp the boat, her arms
clasped round the child on her lap, which
was closely wrapped in a seaman's waterproof.
And, lest the mother's strength or
clasp might fail, they were lashed together
and to the seat, and swathed in rugs and
covers, over all, like one great mummy.

All skill and care had been given to
their warmth and security, but whether the
boat had capsized and righted itself, or
had shipped seas, and their long exposure
to driving spray and rain had served to
drench them, could only be imagined.

They had been rescued from their perilous
position, during a brief lull in the
tempest, and then only at the hazard of
men's lives.

It was a daring feat to swing at a rope's
end into the tossing boat and make it last
to The Lass of Kent, the poor half-drowned
mother being; too numb with cold and wet,
too dazed with fright to put out a hand to
save herself had she been free and not fast.

It was almost as hazardous to attempt

her release whilst the boat rocked and
swayed on the unquiet sea, but binding
knots were severed with a knife, and they
were hauled on board together as they
were, as helpless as logs ; only the wail of
a child proclaiming animation. The boat
broke away almost at that instant, their
deliverer saying " it was a close shave," ashe
scrambled on deck.

Fortunately, the wife of Kit Blean, the
skipper, was on board ; a woman strong of
voice and limb and nerve, full of human
sympathy, but not helplessly tender.

Mrs Blean's cabin was not large, and
the floor was far from level as a drawings
but she had a stout heart and a stout
pair of sea-legs, and when the half-dead
mother and child were surrendered to her
keeping — not a man of the small crew
could be spared below — she did all
for them her humanity and experience
prompted.

She tried the efficacy of unadulterated
Hollands as an inward and outward application
on mother and child both, and, finding

that under the oilskin wrap the latter's
body was comparatively dry and warm,
she handed it over to a big lad of her own,
with a charge to chafe its cramped limbs
till it cried, a charge he obeyed to the
letter.

Meanwhile Dinah herself was not idle.
The gasping of both at the strong liquor
had been an assurance of vitality. At
once she set about to remove the mother's
drenched outer wraps, and to wring the
wet from soaking skirts. To change garments
was impossible with the floor at all
angles and her own equilibrium so insecure ;
but she stripped her berth of its blankets
and rolled them round the helpless form
with an instinctive knowledge of a " water-cure
" process not derived from books.

The cabin was close and warm, the
blankets were thick, the Hollands a potential
specific, and ere long the saturated clothes
of finer texture than Mrs Blean's — ceased
to chill, and beQfan to warm. It was not,
however, until the little one, roused by
rough kindness to a perception of strange

faces and strange surroundings, cried for
Mamma ! " that the quivering of Hps and
eyelids betokened returning consciousness.

The child's piteous cry had stirred the
feeble heart and given the sinking pulse
the fillip that was needed.

There," cried the good woman, as she
watched the white face by the light of the
swinging lamp, " that's just what I wanted.
Give the little lass that, Christ, she be
hungry," and a piece of roughly-buttered
bread was put into the little one's trembling
hand, to appease at once its hunger and its
anxieties. It was more than bread and
butter could do.

All this while the rolling and straining
of the vessel, the dash of waters, the shrill
whistling of the wind had continued, with
now and then a temporary lull to give the
weary mariners a breathing space.

The fury of the storm was well-nigh
spent before Dinah's good offices were more
thoroughly rewarded. She had watched
uneasily for some time, with the child on
her own lap, when she saw, by the flickering

light of her overhanging lamp, a little
warmth come over the ashen-grey face, the
eyes open, the lips part, and soon a faint
voice murmur, " Etta, Etta."

Little arms outstretched at the sound,
and " Mamma, mamma ! " came in quick
response.

Thank God for all His mercies! She
be coming round," cried Dinah Blean fervently.


Straightway she placed the little one on
the bunk beside her mother, saying soothingly,
" Here, Hetty, kiss mammy. All
safe now, Hetty."

Hetty" was the rendering of the name
most familiar to Mrs Blean's ear and
tongue. The child was not skilled in
niceties of sound. The mother only answered
her soft kisses with " Etta, Etta ; "
and long before she was capable of explanation,
the aspirated version had been
adopted, and clung to the girl.

When at last The Lass of Kent had
navigated the Stour, and was safely moored
by the quay-side, the skipper was free to

go below and inquire about the castaways.
It was over sleeping "Hetty" he bent a
rugged but kindly face. And when townspeople
near the quay, kept awake by the
storm, came flocking round to hail their
safe arrival, it was as " Hetty " the pretty
child was shown to Fosse the bridge-keeper
(who lived beside the gate), to mine
host of the " Crispin," and also to the Rev.
Austin Ughtred and to Dr Cunningham,
both of whom had been drawn thither by
the swiftly-circulated intelligence that a
shipwrecked lady needed attention.

'* So you've turned the lady's wet clothing
into a sort of vapour bath ! Very good,
very good, Mrs Blean ; in fact, the best
thing you could have done under the circumstances.
In all probability she owes
her life to your care," said the doctor, who
had felt the garments steaming under the
blankets, and then had his fingers on an
intermitting pulse. " But the question is,
What is to be done with her ? She is in a
very critical state — no doubt owing to
the shock as much as to the immersion —

and, in fact, though scarcely fit to be removed,
is still less fit to remain here."

Indeed, she was utterly incapable of
giving a lucid answer to a question ; all
she could say was " Etta, Etta," whenever
the child was taken from her, as if she had
only an instinctive perception left.

There followed an immediate consultation
on deck, the result of which was the
removal of the helpless creature and her
child to the " Crispin," the clergyman and
the doctor between them guaranteeing expenses
to the landlord, in case friends did
not claim her, though it is only justice to
say he repudiated the necessity for such
guarantee as a stigma on his humanity.

Let us not speculate how much the lady's
finger-rings, or the heavy gold chain round
her neck, had to do with the care bestowed
on her by one and all ; let us give Christian
compassion full credit, and waive
human weakness into the background.

For, though there was a valuable gold
watch attached to the chain, and the chain
of the period was more than a yard long

and thick as a child's finger, they would
hardly have served as payment for all that
lady and her daughter required during the
long weeks in which she remained an unknown,
unnamed stranger, dependent for
food, physic, care, clothing, to the kindness
more than the expectations of others, seeing
that the watch had been ruined with seawater,
and that no friends had come forward
with claim or inquiry.

And long before it was known that she
was the wife (or widow) of Karl Fleming,
the commander of the ill-fated barque
Euretta, or that the child had been named
after his ship, the pretty little Euretta had
been petted and fondled by the wives and
daughters of doctor and clergyman, as well
as trades-people and fisher folk, the frequenters
of the innkeeper's bar-parlour, to
say nothing of good Mrs Blean and the
brave skipper, whenever The Lass of Kent
came into port. Then she ran about the gate
and the bridge under the watchful eyes of
Jack Fogge, lingered to prattle to his oldwife
in their neat parlour, which almost

VOL. I. M

seemed a part of the old stone barbican,
and, as if by general adoption and consent,
was dubbed " Our Hetty."

For that which gave permanence to
the pronoun we must crave the reader's
patience.

We have at least shown that when Boniface,
the bridge-keeper, and others disclaimed
all knowledge of "Our Hetty's"
painted semblance, as presented by Pierce
Hathersage, they had disregarded truth.
They had justified the malversation to
themselves, no doubt. They set up the
lie as a barrier between Hetty and a —
supposition.

MRS FLEMINGS FRIENDS.

HE "Bell," in Strand Street, was
a much larger inn than the
"Crispin." Under its roof King
Charles H. had been entertained;
it had stabling and accommodation for the
yeomen and farmers who drove into Sandwich
for the corn-market on Wednesdays ;
and it had a sort of frontage to the river,
its taproom standing broadly forth upon
the quay, whilst the " Crispin " had little to
boast of but its antiquity.

Anyone not in the secret might have
expected that "Hetty" and her mother

would have been borne straightway to the
nearer and larger hostelry.

But if the landlord was on the quay at
the time, he was not one of the special few
Kit Blean invited into his cabin, or he
might have been as ready to open charitable
doors to the castaways as mine host of
the smaller tavern. Indeed, he was heard
to say that he "thought the * Bell' would
have been a much fitter refuge for a lady
For when the lady and her child were
carried under the Barbican Gate to the low-roofed
"Crispin," it was expected that a
few hours' or at most a few days' rest and
quiet would set her up again.

It was also anticipated that when properly
conscious she would give some
account of herself, some clue to her connections,
or the ship whence she had been
cast adrift, so that her friends misfht be
communicated with.

That she had friends anxious for tidings
of her fate, friends who would rush to reward
her deliverers, and claim her and her
child with joy and gratitude, was taken for

granted. The texture of her linen, of her
full-skirted silken dress, of her shawls and
cloak, in which they were both enveloped,
no less than her jewellery, were suggestive
of abundant means, not to say wealth.
And the wealthy are seldom without
friends.

Then the imperfect prattle of the lovely
and artless little child was English, and
what more likely than a belief that friends
were English too, and, therefore, at hand.

But many weeks went by — weeks in
which torpor and delirium alternated.
Long immersion had brought on rheumatic
fever, and the shock to the nervous system
had acted on a brain never over strong.
Yet, though the fat and fussy little doctor
had rubbed his bald pate, and brushed
back with both hands the white hairs that
bristled up around his crown, and brought
out as a rarely-failing source of inspiration
the silver snuff-box, known as a tribute
from a grateful patient, when discussing
the " interesting case," in acknowledged
doubt and perplexity, with the benevolent.

but lank-bodied, lean-visaged clergyman,
who had been his joint-guarantee for "expenses,"
he never rubbed up the sublime
idea of advertising.

Nor did there seem more inspiration in
the many pinches of " lund-foote" he dispensed
to his intimates, for never a sandwiches
suggested what would now-a-days
be the first thought.

Forty years ago the newspaper press
had not obtained its present proportions —
had not entered so closely into the homes
and lives of the people. There were events
looming in the far distance which would
waken up the activities and test the powers
of the press, but the first stirring of the
whirlwind had not besfun to be felt. Then
advertising was regarded neither as a
science nor a fine art, and the "agony
column" had yet to be recognised as such.
Certainly it was not a known fact in Sandwich,
if at all.

Even when reason regained her seat,
and the sick lady was able to note her surroundings,
and answer her hostess that her

name was " Flemings," such an outburst of
passionate grief followed, that Dr Manningham
forbade further questioning.

Indeed a relapse, and more than a relapse,
might be expected to follow, he told
the innkeeper's wife.

Yes, you are curious, no doubt. So
are we all curious. But we must keep
our curiosity bottled up like wine, until it
is ripe for use. Mrs Fleming is low, very
low ; this agitation will throw her back considerably.
In fact, so prostrate is her condition,
that any premature reminder of
what she must have suffered or lost in the
storm might cause her to slip through our
fingers, Mrs Tilby — and — and — in fact, we
can hardly afford that." A significant tap
on the brown head of little Hetty, and a
glance as significant, pointed his speech,
as he bowed himself out.

"In fact, sir," said he to the Rev. Austin
Ughtred, whom he met in Strand Street,
not far from St Mary's Church, half-an-hour
later, rapping the lid of his silver
snuff-box with his well-covered knuckles

as he spoke, " though perfectly well meaning,
Mrs Tilby's curiosity is apt to outrun
her discretion, and it was needful to give
it a check. In fact, sir, we must not only
wait until the poor young creature is
stronger, but we must approach the subject
of the storm with caution. We know not
whom she may have lost, or what horrors
she may have witnessed. There is certainly
some great load on her mind. The
subject will have to be approached with
great tact and delicacy — when she can
bear it — and — a — in fact, I wish you, sir,
would undertake the office. I know no
fitter man for the task. A painful one it
is sure to be."

Suppose, doctor, we wait until Mrs
Fleming — I think you said that was her
name — until she questions tis ? " was the
reverend gentleman's reply. " Much interrogation
will not be necessary, I imagine.
She will be as anxious for our intelligence
as we for hers. I have seen how eagerly
and wistfully her eyes followed her lovely
little child, and then wandered round the

room as if in search of some missing face
or faces."

You are quite right, Mr Ughtred, sofar
" (with another dip into his box), " and I
advise waiting — but only until the patient's
nerves are stronger. And if we don't take
the initiative, someone else will who has
no tact. In fact, sir — and it's but human
nature, — the Tilbys are getting uneasy
about the bill running up, and are speculating
how far our hasty guarantee maybe
depended upon.'

Have they said anything ?" asked the
other gravely.

Not exactly, but I've seen it in their
faces, and in speculations on the value of
the poor creature's trinkets ; and — and — in
fact, though I'm as willing as any man to
forego fees in such a case, I'm a family
man — and, and — "

You would like to be satisfied who is
to meet the innkeeper's bill ? ' put in the
other, with a faint smile.

Well, — not exactly," replied the doctor,
unwilling to have his motives probed too

closely; "but I think Mrs Tilly is. She
said to-day, the people at the ' Bell ' were
glad to have missed the charge, and she
thought Mrs Fleming had no friends ! "

Then, doctor, it behoves us to prove
the contrary ! Good morning ; " and the
clergyman, who had walked back with him,
went his way up a woefully narrow and uninviting
road called Bowling Street,
where the houses were all of the poorer
class, to Vicarage Lane, a short lane shut
in by blank walls, without hedge or tree,
with its other outlet in Church Street,
and where the long, low, unpretentious
Vicarage was the only respectable abode.
And only the doorway gave distinction to
that.

He was a man not more than thirty-five
years of age, with a pale face, broad high
forehead, and deep-set serious eyes, which
seemed to have grown sad with looking on
the sorrows and sins around him. His
face narrowed to the chin, and already
pitiful lines were deepening around his
mouth — a mouth with tender and compassionate

curves and smiles, if it never
broke into broad laughter.

After the doctor's hint he left Mrs
Tilby small chance to satisfy impatient
curiosity to the injury of the patient, and
there were whispers in the bar-parlour that
"between doctor, vicar, and the vicar's
housekeeper, there would not be a rag of
carpet left on the stairs."

You see, Mrs Tilby had not been consulted
in the arrangement which placed an
invalid and a child in her chartres to be
nursed and tended for an indefinite period,
with indefinite results, and good nature has
its limits.

Her womanly instincts and her commercial
ones were at variance. She bes^an
to reproach her husband with his precipitation
and imprudence, but for all that she
never suffered her vigilant watch of the
invalid to relax, or made anything but a pet
of the child, who somehow reminded her
of a little one of her own, long laid to rest
under a green coverlet in St Clement's
Churchyard.

That she had fine fibres in her nature, and
that they had been stirred by Etta's forlorn
condition, was shown in the conversion of
a sacred little wardrobe laid up in lavender,
to the poor wee stranger's use, and in the
care bestowed on her glossy dark hair.

Of her time and toil she gave ungrudgingly
and without stint ; the limit of her
food nature was the cost — the cost in coin.

Mrs Tilby and Dr Manningham were
not so widely different after all, even in
the matter of curiosity, but his was kept in
check by scientific knowledge ; as was that
of the Rev. Austin Ughtred by a delicate
shrinking from the infliction of pain.

The landlady, as had been anticipated,
forestalled both of them, in spite of caution.
There were two entrances to the " Crispin."
One to the bar, the other nearer to
the Barbican, a two-leaved door opening
almost at the foot of the private staircase,
between the bar and a smoking-room to the
right.

Five or six days had gone by since his
conversation with Dr Manningham, when

the clergyman bent his tall head to enter
at this double door, but ere he could set
his foot on the first stair, which was barely
a stride for his long legs, Mrs Tilby darted
out of the bar to confront him, with a face
and tone of importance, in which habitual
awe of the vicar was lost.

"Lacus heart! sir, what do you think ? "
she began. " Why, the poor thing upstairs
was on board the barque that struck on
Sandown Castle, and her husband was the
captain. I only just asked if the figurehead
of his ship was a woman with a blue
skirt, and a queer name on her belt, when
she screamed out ' The Euretta ! ' and I
thought all had gone to wrongs with her
again. The doctor's with her, and I think
she's all to rights now, but I got feared."

"Dr Manningham advised you to be
cautious, Mrs Tilby," said the vicar, in
accents of rebuke.

But that was a week ago, sir, and one
cannot always have one's wits about one."

"So it would seem," he remarked, quietly.
*' What more did your wisdom suggest ? "

>

./

Why, sir, when she cried and begged
so hard to know the worst, I could not
help telling her that the barque had gone
to pieces, and not a soul had been saved
but her and Hetty."

And what then ?" he asked, gravely.

Why, she fell back in a dead faint ; and
Tilby ran off helter-skelter for the doctor.
But, lacus heart ! I meant no harm, no
more I didn't. I only said she might be
thankful she and Hetty were saved."

Ah ! and also thankful that her husband
was lost ? " and to the speaker's caustic
tone was added a keen, sideway glance at
Mrs Tilby's conscience-smitten countenance,
as, with his hand on the balustrade,
he put a second foot forward.

"No, sir! no more I didn't," she answered,
sharply ; " not but what some husbands
are better lost than found," and with
that she retreated to her customers in the
bar, leaving him free to join the doctor in
the room above.

It was a room with a window overlooking
Strand Street. Beneath this window stood

a small oaken chest of drawers, which did
duty as a dressing-table ; and close beside
stood the head of a four-post bed hung
with chintz of a by-gone pattern, the tester
of which touched the low ceiling.

Propped on pillows little whiter than the
face that pressed them, lay the fair-haired
woman for whom death had been fighting
by sea and on shore.

She did not seem more than five or six-and-twenty,
and might be younger. There
had been a certain kind of beauty in the
face, but there had never been strength or
power, and the sharpening fingers of pain
had left their marks upon it.

Little Etta, in a dark frock and pink
pinafore, lay coiled on the white coverlet,
with her brown head nestling ag-ain't the
fair one — her mother's only solace.

On a chair by the bedside sat the
doctor, a labelled phial and wine-glass on
the dressing-table behind him telling of a
draught he had administered. There, too,
lay a gold watch and chain.

As the vicar entered the room, head

foremost, with a stoop rendered natural by
long practice in low doorways, the doctor
held up his finger to bespeak caution.

Hush ! she is sleeping, and I think the
worst is over," he said, in low tones, as he
gave his hand to the other's clasp ; " she
will no doubt be calm and reasonable
when she awakes. In fact, that blundering
woman downstairs has done less harm
than might have been expected ; and she
has spared us a painful task."

Has Mrs Fleming said anything to
you :

Not much. But I have other patients
to see. Can you take my place so as to
be at hand if she awakes clear-headed ? "

The vicar assented. He took the
vacated chair, drew a book from his pocket,
and read to fill the time, and something
more, for ere long he lost himself in his
study.

An hour or more had gone by, during
which, it seemed as if the ordinary noises
of the house and the corner had been
thoughtfully stilled.

You are very kind, sir," said a faint
voice, from the pillows, breaking the stillness
; " all are very kind. I — know not how
I shall ever repay it."

Gather strength, my dear madam, and
that will repay us."

Ah, yes ; perhaps you, sir, you are the
clergyman ? But — but," and tears seemed
welling up into the blue eyes, " I have
been — ill a long time, and there is the
doctor — and — "

Oh, don't trouble about the doctor, he
only wants to get you off his hands."

And the — the person of the house, she
tells me we have been here for more than
six weeks. She will want us off her hands
too, and how am I to pay — "

You must not talk, Mrs Fleming.
Keep your mind easy. The Lord will
provide."

She was silent a few moments as if
pondering his speech. Then she began
afresh, —

Yes, yes — but I must talk, or how will
you understand. It is so miserable to lie

VOL. I. N

and think — and to be helpless " (she had
almost lost the use of her lower limbs), "and
friendless, twice wrecked as it were, and
not to know — " and here she been to sob.

The Eternal Friend who drew you and
your little one out of the deep waters, will
not leave you helpless if you seek Him.
And here am I, His servant, ready to write
to any relative you may desire to send for."

Oh, sir, the cruel waves have swallowed
up the only friend left to me ! " She burst
into fresh lamentation. "Oh, my poor Carl !
my dear husband ! torn from us so terribly!"

A little arm stole round her neck, a little
cheek was pressed to hers, and the child he
had thought asleep said pitifully, " Don't ky,
mamma, don't ky. Etta don't like to see
mamma ky." Deeply moved, he left her
grief time to subside. Then he asked,
gently, " Have you no brother, no father ? "

At the word " father," she clasped her
thin hands together, and cried, piteously,
Father? ah, the kindest, best ; but he has
discarded, disowned me. He cast me off
when Carl took me to sea with him."

Then had you married without his
consent ? "

No."

She put forth a thin hand and pointed
towards the watch and chain on the dress-unstable.


Father gave me ten thousand pounds
and that gold watch and chain on the
condition that Carl should make our home
in his, and that I should never be taken
from him, or to sea. Oh, it was an unlucky
promise ! "

"Unlucky in the making or the breaking?"
put the clergyman.

Both, said she," in a tone of distress.

And then, bit by bit, she told, with
many a sobbing interruption, how, after a
voyage or two, Carl had insisted upon
taking her with him, and how her father
had bade her make choice between the
two, and when she had clung to her husband,
her father had cast her off in a rage,
which had terrified her. But she did not
say how she had pined for her husband in
his absence, or how, on his return, her

fretful tears at a fresh parting had wrought
upon his affections — ay, to the forfeiture
of his word. And she could not tell what
Carl had done with her fortune. She did
not know.

But the vicar gathered that Martin Copeland,
the great city merchant, was a man
to whom a promise was as binding as a
sealed bond, and that his resentment was
against the man who had deceived him,
not against his only child. He felt assured
that he had only to write and lay before the
offended father a simple statement of the
condition in which his child and grandchild
were cast among strangers, and forgiveness
would surely follow.

Mrs Fleming was not so sanguine. Her
own appeals for reconciliation had been all
unanswered.

Perhaps, sir, if you enclosed your letter
in one to my aunt, Mrs Norreys, who came
to live with us in Russell Square before my
marriage, and if you gave my dear love to
her, and asked her, for little Etta's sake, to
intercede with him, he might be moved to

pity. If not " — here her eyes turned to the
jewellery on the table, — " will you please
tell me if the chain and rings would pay
Mrs Tilby if sold?" she sighed heavily;
I should not like to part with the watch,
unless — "

He did not say the watch was spoiled
and all but worthless, only " Time enough
for that, madam, when other sources fail.
Pray look forward cheerfully."

He pressed her thin hand reassuringly,
patted the brown head of Etta, nestling
against her mother's shoulder as if for mutual
comfort, and left the room to set Mrs
Tilby's fears at rest and her tongue in
motion, with the announcement that Mrs
Fleming's father was a rich London merchant,
with whom he was about to communicate.


A TUNE ON A VIOLIN.

HE vicar's letters were written
and despatched.

Mrs Fleming, more composed
now the first shock was over,
was gaining strength, and had been lifted
from the bed to an easy-chair, but was as
yet quite unable to use her feet, or to
stand. It is probable that she was reviving
under the influence of hope.

But as one day after another died out,
and no one either came or wrote, the wistful
eagerness with which she listened for
the postman's foot in the street, changed

to doubt and disappointment as hope died
with the days.

Then, weary of Mrs Tilby's wondering
and comments, she asked for pen and ink,
and herself made a pathetic appeal to her
father's heart for the sake of her " fatherless
Euretta."

The tear-stained epistle came back under
cover to the Rev. Austin Uijhtred, with a
few curt lines from Mrs Norreys, to say
that " Mr Copeland refused to hold any
communication whatsoever with his ungrateful
daughter. She had forsaken him.
No further appeal for or by her would be
regarded or answered. He was not the
man to change or waver. The five-pound
note enclosed was from her own purse, but
no more would be forthcoming, as she risked
her brother's displeasure in sending that, and
her private income was not a large one."

With these in his hand the good vicar
sought Dr Manningham, whom he found
on his own door-step in King Street.
What do you think of that ?" he asked.

Think ? " said the doctor, when he had

read the epistle, ' It is a case of unmitigated
barbarity. Unfortunately it is not
without parallel. In fact, I attended a
man who — But perhaps you are in haste,
and so am I, a man at the Black Mill has
broken his leg."

Then I will walk with you," said the
vicar, well accustomed to the doctor's in-completed
instances. " I wish to have
your opinion about the five-pound note.
My own inclination would be to send it
back, but I fear we cannot venture to do
that."

Send it back ! " cried the lite doctor
aghast, " when the poor creature has not a
penny, and Mrs Tilby is in a fidget about
her bill. In fact, she gave me a strong
hint yesterday that she wanted paying, and
said, if it had not been for little Hetty,
she could not have waited so long ; that it
was like Tilby's thoughtlessness saddling
her with a sick woman and child ; that the
Bell ' took most of the water-side custom,
and had a right to take such chances —
she had not."

Then you think this had better be
flung as a sop to the Tilbys ?"

Yes, yes ; but what then ? Even if
we amputate her bill, if there is no more
cash to follow, what is to become of the
poor woman ? We cannot treat her as a
common pauper."

Charity forbid ! " ejaculated the vicar.

And 1 fear she will be disabled for life,"
continued the other. "In fact, she will want
a pair of crutches out of that bank-note."

It is a sad case, a very sad case," ruminated
Austin Ughtred ; "a terrible fall
for one reared in luxury ; but I should
think she would have some claim on the
ship owners. At all events, we can but try
And, doctor, if you will lend me your cob,
I will ride over to Canterbury tomorrow,
and do my best in converting the poor
creature's few trinkets into coin, as Mrs
Tilby suggested to her long ago."

They had reached the curious old house
in Strand Street (recently rebuilt) where
Queen Elizabeth had lodged, and there
they parted, the one bustling off to the

Black Mill, which stood beyond the Walls
on the Richborough road, the other retracing
his steps thoughtfully with his hands
clasped behind him, until he reached the
Crispin.

The letter was a sad blow to Mrs Fleming's
new hopes, and she wept copiously ;
said her " aunt and father must both be
dreadfully changed ; " that " it was only
natural she should want to be with her husband,
and that her aunt had no need to be
niggardly with her bank-notes, they were
plentiful enough when she was at home."

It was some time before the vicar could
get her to look broadly into the facts of the
case, with reference to the future ; she
could but weep, lament her helplessness,
and her inability to see what was to be
done. She was one of those weak, clinging
women who, like the woodbine, need support
and training ; had been a pretty
inanity, petted, spoiled, and utterly unfitted
to combat with the world. One of those
women who expect everything to be done
for them — and get it too, as a rule.

She assented to every proposition, was
thankful to have a few pounds for Mrs
Tilby, was disconsolate at the prospect of
the crutch, and gave up her trinkets readily
if ruefully, retaining only her father's
watch and a brooch containing a portrait
of the lost captain, Carl Fleming ; it was
set round with opals, and in good preservation,
having been worn in her bosom.

The five-pound note was handed over
to Mrs Tilby intact, and a wonderfully
soothing influence it had. Loud were
her denunciations of "unnatural fathers who
could leave a sweet innocent like Hetty to
the mercy of strangers," and many her
protests that "the little darling should
never want a friend while she lived ; and
as for the clothes she had found her,
she should think it a sin to charge for
them."

Moreover, in private confidence she
imparted to her husband her opinion that
perhaps they had, as the vicar had said,
entertained angels unawares, so many profitable
customers had the child and her

mother brought to the " Crispin," either
out of kindness or curiosity.

Having put his hand to the plough, the
Rev. Austin Ughtred was not the one to
turn back. He argued that the very
heartlessness of Mrs Fleming's relations
made his duty as a minister of God only
the more urgent.

He journeyed to Canterbury with her
few trinkets ; he wrote at once to the
shipowners.

The result of his journey was ten
guineas ; of his letter to the shipowners
a bundle of clergy correspondence and
considerable delay.

It appeared that two seamen, one a
Portuguese, had been picked up from the
floating mainmast, and on claiming their
wages had severally made affidavit that
the loss of the Euretta was mainly due to
the captain's wife, who distracted his attention
from the charge of his ship to care for
herself and child. That, such being the
case. Captain Fleming was liable to forfeit
more than the moneys due to him.

This she denied, said that she and Etta
were not placed in the boat until all hope
of saving the barque was gone, and that
the Portuguese sailor had sent them adrift
in revenge on the captain, who had threatened
to punish him for disobedience and
laziness.

Her denial was duly attested and forwarded,
and then came, after some delay,
thirty pounds, not in acknowledgment of
any claim, but as a compassionate subscription
from the three partners in relief
of the widow's distress.

The utter helplessness and incapacity
of some women seems to touch the heart
of man like the helplessness of infancy.
Especially must it be so when the woman
is comparatively young and pretty, is refined
and well-bred, and has been overwhelmed
by a sudden calamity.

The vicar of St Mary's was never known
to turn a deaf ear to either ao^e or holiness
in distress, but he was man enough
to be unconsciously stirred by common
human influences, and he had never taken

up a cause with more earnestness than
when, as he said to the doctor, he felt as
if they had two children on their hands
to think and act for.

Sandwich, small as is the town, has
three parish churches, — St Peter's, St
Clement's, and St Mary's. The two latter
are now united under one vicar, but at
that time they were separate, and not very
magnificent livings.

It so happens that, although the "Crispin"
is situated at a corner of Strand Street,
and almost in a line parallel with St Mary's
Church, it lies within the parish of St
Clement's, a church in the opposite
direction.

It was no sooner bruited abroad that a
lady and her child had been rescued from
shipwreck and lay at the little inn, than
the vicar of St Clement's and his wife
called together, fondled the little girl,
made inquiries, but finding that the vicar
of St Mary's had " taken up the case,"
departed in a huff at the unwarrantable intrusion
beyond his own parish boundary.

They did not even console themselves
on being spared the trouble and cost, until
a few weeks later, when it reached their
ears that the lady had no friends, and that
the Rev. Austin Ughtred and Dr Manningham
had " passed their word for
Tilby's bill."

You are well out of it, my dear," said
the lady complacently. " I only wonder
what Mrs Manningham will say to it."

Her ' say' had not made the doctor too
comfortable over his impulsive generosity.


And not too comfortable did St Clement's
vicar feel when his brother cleric
of St Mary's called upon him in behalf
of the widow, at the modest red brick
house in Knightrider Street, near the
church, which served him in lieu of a
vicarage.

He sat stiffly silent, listening to the
earnest missionary's explanatory proem ;
but no sooner did he comprehend that he
was called upon as the vicar of St
Clement's to consider how the unfortunate

lady and her child could be provided for in
the future, than he comfortably washed his
hands of the whole business.

Yes, sir, the ' Crispin ' is in my parish,
you say ; but I do not see that these
strangers are in my cure. Moreover,
when you officiously intermeddled with my
parishioners, the Tilbys, and left your own
parish work to meddle with mine, I washed
my hands of the whole business."

Charity is of no parish," answered the
other, rising, " or I should not have intruded
on yours. Its domain is the world.
Good day, sir."

He was more successful with the rector
of St Peter's, though he, too, talked of
parish limits, and feared to intrude on his
neighbour's province ; but he did bestir
himself, and the two together waited upon
the mayor to discuss the possibility of
findlno- the widow and her child a home in
one or other of the old monkish hospitals
or almshouses connected with the town,
and in the gift of the corporation.

Their reception was cordial ; but though

the mayor confessed he was "willing' to
strain a point in such an extreme case," the
laxity of old rule was of the past, and
barriers rose on all sides.

Not merely her child, but her age (or
want of it), excluded Mrs Fleming from
St Bartholomew's, no brother or sister
being admitted younger than sixty.

I thought, Mr Mayor, that the ' harbinger
' of St John's, being chartered for
Pilgrims, might open its doors to the lady
and child both," said the rector ; " one
woman was admitted with her four children,
and is there now."

Yes, sir," replied the mayor ; " but that
was an abuse of the charity ; still, the
woman was the widow of a fi'eema7i, and
only such are eligible. The shelter for
pilgrims was only temporary, and has fallen
into desuetude in the lapse of centuries and
of pilgrimages. The shipwrecked lady
has no claim, either as a pilgrim or a native
of the town. I am sorry we cannot help
her ; but so it is. Can Mrs Fleming do
nothing towards her own support ?"

VOL. I. o

Until she can use her crutches, she will
be Unable even to wait on herself or child,"
was Austin Ughtred's reply. "But she has
had a good education; is, she tells me, a fair
gentlewoman ; was a good musician before
she went to sea, and, if she had but a
home, might in time earn her own living
if the mayoress and other ladies would
interest themselves to procure her work
and pupils. But the first thing is to find
her a home, and since no public charity is
open to her needs, I must see what can be
done in my own area."

You know she can have coals free, on
application to the churchwardens," struck
in the rector,

She will require much more than coals.
She will need a house and furniture, if she
is to keep a school, and at least food and
shelter until she can," said her thoughtful
advocate. " Then, save the change of
linen sent at the outset by the mayoress for
Mrs Fleming's use, she is almost destitute
of raiment. Mrs Tilby, good woman, supplied
the sweet little one with clothes from

a sacred store of her own ; and she declares
the mother's outer garments are utterly
ruined by the sea water ; indeed, that she
will want clothing, to be commonly decent."

"No doubt, no doubt! I'll name it to
Mrs Rolfe ; she knows more of such
matters than I, and will not require
prompting," responded the mayor quickly,
bowing them out.

Walking homewards, with his hands
behind him, as was his wont, the exigencies
of his new trust upon his mind, the vicar's
ear was arrested by the melody of Cowper's
solemn hymn, " God moves in a mysterious
way," vibrating on the strings of a
well-known violin, under the touch of no
uncertain bow.

The musician struck a chord he had not
anticipated.

The clergyman paused, smiled, as if a
difficulty was clearing away, and, instead
of crossing into Church Street on his way
home, turned the handle of a cottage door
opposite to the church porch, and stepped
without ceremony over the threshold.

Passing through a neat front parlour
over a clean rag carpet, he entered a back
apartment, one corner of which was occupied
with a very low stool, bundles of
osiers, and an unfinished basket. A middle-aged
woman, in a dark cotton gown, was
placing a saucepan on the fire ; and
standing by the table, in front of the
window, as if for the benefit of the light,
stood the musician in his shirt-sleeves
handling his bow, a man almost as thin
and tall as himself, one who had no need
of the light ; for he was sightless.

It was Will Ashurst, basket-maker, and
leader of St Mary's choir. There was no
organ in the church, and it was before the
day of harmoniums.

The wife, a homely woman, who wore a
spotless white muslin cap, primly frilled
around her plain but pleasant face, curtsied
respectfully, and hastened to dust a distress
chair with her check apron, touching her
husband on the arm as she passed.

Will, here be the vicar."

The bow quivered on the strings for an

instant, then was lifted, and the man whose
whole being had been surrendered to the
divine strain, lowering his instrument,
confronted their visitor, as if he saw
him.

Mr Ashurst," said the vicar, more respectful
than he might have been to a
different man nearer his own rank, "could
you contrive for a short time to make room
for the shipwrecked lady and her child now
at the ' Crispin,' or rather could your wife ?
For I must tell you she is likely to be very
helpless for some time, and, although quite
a lady, will now be compelled to sew or
teach for her own maintenance and her
child's."

Ay, ay, sir, and welcome," cried the
man impulsively.

"Well, sir," answered the woman, more
hesitatingly, " our poor place be never fit
for a lady, no more it don't — but — if, as
you say, she be reduced to get her own
living, maybe she could put up with it, and
a child in the house would be a God-send
to Will."

Ay, ay," interrupted he, " a blessing
comes with a child."

She could have the parlour and front
bedroom, sir. We could make shift with
the back, couldn't us, Will ? "

"Ay, ay, Matte."

Nothing had as yet been said about payment,
but before the vicar left he had
arranged for the reception of Mrs Fleming
and Euretta, on terms as creditable to
them as to herself.

Scrupulously clean was Mrs Ashurst's
little parlour ; but though the narrow
limits of a ship's cabin had familiarised
Mrs Fleming with want of space, no
luxury had been spared in the cabin's
adornment, and the poverty of her new
surroundings affected her keenly.

When Fogge and a man from the quay
carried her, well wrapped up, in an armchair,
straight from the street into her
parlour, without any intermediate passage,
she noted not the fire blazing in the old-fashioned
grate to welcome her, not the
cleanliness of the well-washed chintz cover

of the squab sofa and easy-chair surrendered
for her use, not the brightness of the brass
fender and fire irons, and the candlesticks
on the low mantelshelf — only the common
order of things, and the want of privacy ina
room opening direct on the street.

Her first ejaculation told it.

"Is this my room ? Is there no entrance-hall
? Oh. dear!"

Neither the words nor the heavy sigh
which followed were lost on Mrs Ashurst.
She, however, had a large fund of sympathy
to draw upon ; had been a domestic in a
great house before her marriage, so could
imagine what Mrs Fleming's loss had
been ; and, as she removed wraps, helped
her new inmate to the sofa, dismissed the
men, and set out her best teacups" on her
best tray, chatting the while to lively little
Euretta, who danced about delighted with
the novelty, she said to herself, —

Poor thing ! Lame, and lost all I Ita
fearsome blow for her. No doubt she
do feel the difference. We must be very
patient with her."

A good deal of patience was needed.
Never having been trained to self-denial,
Mrs Fleming had neither perception nor
knowledge of any self-sacrifice on the part
of those who had opened their door to
lodgers for the first time in their lives, and
who gave up their best of all things for her
use. She saw only meanness and poverty
in her surroundings. When the ship-brokers'
donation came, a few articles of
furniture were added to brighten her
rooms, but nothing would reconcile her to
her new life — not even the artless caresses
of her child. And had she foreseen how
many years she would have to exist under
that lowly roof, it is more than likely her
brain would again have lost its balance.

THE PINCH OF POVERTY.

H E traveller through Strand Street,
with his face set towards Canterbury
or Richborough, would pass
between the long, low, one-sided
church of St Mary on the left, and Will
Ashurst's modest dwelling on the rio;ht —
one of two with red-tiled gable-roofs — more
inclined to note the divergence of the
church from the parallel line of street, or
the " King's Arms " thrusting itself squarely
forth at the other corner of Church Street,
than any peculiarity possessed by the
modest dwelling occupied by the musical
basket - maker, unless he had an eye

for shining windows and well-washed
paint.

But blind Will might have told you that
from those windows you could look far up
Church Street and see when the vicar was
coming ; just as the admiring eyes of Mrs
Ashurst followed him when he crossed the
road, beaming with satisfaction at the
arrangement he had made.

I am glad that business is settled," he
said to himself, as his hands again went
behind him. "It is better than the almshouse
and the parish dole. We must
induce Mrs Tilby to accept another five
pounds in entire settlement of her claim.
That will leave a few pounds to maintain
the widow and orphan, until we hear from
the ship owners, or she can earn a living
by her own industry. And by payment
she will retain her own self-respect and
self-dependence. Dr Manningham will be
pleased to be released from his responsibility.
The little man's fidgetiness about
it of late has been quite amusing. I should
think Mrs Fleming would equally rejoice

to remove her little one to a purer atmosphere."


And so well content was he with his
morning's work, that neither the grumbling
of his housekeeper nor the happiness of
his over-cooked dinner had disturbed his
equanimity.

It was somewhat discouraging to find
that the impoverished and helpless lady,
on whose behalf he had taken so much
trouble, did not share his satisfaction.

He found her, on his first visit in her
new abode, lying on the sofa drowned in
tears, bewailing her misfortunes, whilst Etta,
Mrs Ashurst, and blind Will were all three
endeavouring to console her, and in vain.

The poor child was sobbing because her
mother cried, in sympathy for a sorrow
she could not comprehend.

At the entrance of the vicar, the basket-maker
and his wife retired to their own
interrupted employments, the former observing,
in a low tone, before he went, —

It is a great hardship for one who has
been a lady all her life to come down to

our common ways and humble rooms, sir.
It has put her all out of tune, just as if I
was to hang my fiddle up in the washhouse.
And no wonder, sir."

This was rather discouraging to the
Rev. Austin Ughtred, after he had
established the poor creature so much to
his own satisfaction, and not without some
little sacrifice out of his narrow income.
He had been moved by her tears, when
she wept for her husband's loss, for her
father and aunt's unkindness, for her inability
to pay Mrs Tilby, for her helplessness
and dependence on others, but he
was scarcely so sympathetic when she
began to decry the refuge he had provided
for her utter destitution.

It was not in his nature to be harsh,
but he felt that Mrs Fleming needed a
common-sense reminder of her duty, and
while he took the sobbing child on his lap,
and felt in his pockets for sweets to
comfort her, he asked the distressed
mother quietly, —

What is the matter, Mrs Fleming ? "

Oh dear, dear, I cannot bear it ! These
poor rooms, these common people, I
have never been used to — oh dear! the
contrast between my own home and this !
What have I done to deserve this hard
fate ? "

What has this Httle one done, that her
mother should cause her this needless
distress ? "

"Needless? Oh, Mr Ughtred, you
cannot understand — you — " she sobbed.

Nay, madam, it is you who do not
understand. Were you content to remain
at the inn, contracting a debt you had no
means to discharge ? "

Oh, sir, you know I was not, but this
place — "

Is it not clean ?" he asked, interrupting
her.

Oh, dear, yes ! " she assented, tearfully.


And quiet ? "

Yes."

Are not the people kind and attentive
1 "

Oh, yes, but—"

Do you not think the music of blind
Will's violin better for this little one's ear,
than the coarse songs and blasphemy of a
tavern ? "

There was that in his voice which
seemed to hold her sobs in check. She
assented faintly as one who faced a truth
for the first time.

"If Mrs Tilby had wearied of you and
turned you out of doors, had you anywhere
a shelter for your own head or this child's?"

"God help me! No."

Then, pray, Mrs Fleming, if you cannot
yet be thankful to God for a clean,
quiet home, with kind and pious people,
who surrendered their own bed and sittinc:"-
room to you, a stranger, do not, as a lady,
wound their feelings with reflections on
the poverty of a home which they have
regarded for years with decent pride."

She started ! Had she been doing or
saying anything unbecoming a lady ? She
began to take herself to task. She hardly
heard his further remark, —

v)

"And now let me remind you that we
cannot gauge the decrees of the Almighty
by our own deserts, real or imaginary, anymore
than we can gauge those deserts.
The blind man in the other room might
teach you a lesson of cheerful submission.
He was blinded twenty years ago by a
flash of lightning, which set fire to his
farm, and burnt up the corn he had
harvested. He has suffered and sorrowed,
but he utters no complaint. He is no
common man."

He left her calmer, and ashamed of her
own want of good breeding. She had
observed his courtesy towards these poor
people, and henceforth felt constrained, asa
lady, to accept their kindness and civility
with like courtesy.

But she did not feel one whit more
contented with her surroundings, and
"only put up with them as a temporary
necessity," until the receipt of Captain
Fleming's salary from the shipowners
should enable her to make a change.

Their first letter Mr Ushered had

withheld until she was sufficiently composed
to give it her attention. Their
final one, enclosing a benefaction of thirty
pounds, where she had expected a payment
of about three hundred, to her mind honestly
due, crushed her utterly.

She had no idea of the value of money
or the expenditure of small sums. Her
aunt had taken the cares of household
management off her hands ; on shipboard
all her wants were supplied.

Thirty pounds ! " she exclaimed.
Why, that will not even purchase a
pianoforte, and how can I teach music
without a respectable house and an instrument
? My father gave more than a
hundred pounds for mine."

It needed some argument to convince
her that her own plans were impracticable ;
that she would have to remain where she
was, and be content with a cheap secondhand
piano, if she would retain cash
for immediate use, and that until she
could obtain piano and pupils, she
had better employ her fingers on the

needlework the mayoress and others had
offered her.

It is needless to say that every concession
to common sense cost a shower of
tears.

A well-stocked work-table which had
belonged to Austin Ughtred's mother, and
been treasured as a sacred memorial, he
offered for her use, not without some pain
at its transfer ; respecting the piano he
enlisted the services of his friend, the
organist of Canterbury Cathedral, and
successfully. A square piano in a
mahogany case, which had seen its
best days but was not quite worn out, soon
filled the wall beneath the one window, like
a sideboard, and but seven of her few
sovereigns had gone in the purchase.

She thanked her good friend for every
kindness, in genuine, if stereotyped phrase;
but she let little Etta play with the fittings
of the well-kept work-table, and only
withheld the piano-keys from her busy
fingers, because " the very sound of the
old tin-kettle was excruciating."

VOL. I. p

Fashionable masters had made of
Margaret Copeland a brilliant pianist ;
but playing and teaching require very-different
qualifications, and Margaret
Fleming speedily discovered that not
only a poor instrument and want of
practice, but a deficiency of theoretical
knowledge barred her progress as a
teacher of music.

Her first pupil would have been a
failure, but for Will Ashurst, who, whilst
voluntarily bending his long back over the
piano to tune and set it in order, began to
converse with her on his favourite theme,
and soon discovered her ignorance of
fundamental principles.

If I were you, Mrs Fleming, I would
stick to my needle until I could pick up
what I had forgotten, before I began to
teach. You are out of practice " (so he
delicately put it). " I have never let my
bow lie idle a day. If you will condescend
to call me in when your memory fails,
perhaps I may be some little help."

She thanked him somewhat stiffly, but

she took his advice ; and the respect the
Rev. Austin Ughtred paid to his choir-master
somewhat softened the humiliation
of learning from him what her own highly-paid
masters had not sufficiently taught.

With all Mrs Ashurst's help in carrying
home her work, and her practical lessons
in frugality, Mrs Fleming's reserve fund
slowly melted, and she soon found sewing
for a living a trial alike of her strength and
patience.

She had to rise with the lark as did the
Ashursts, the " Morning Hymn " on Will's
violin being the signal ; and thus only did
she gain time for the musical study now so
necessary if she meant to live by it.

But she never crossed the threshold,
though she soon learned the use of her
crutches in the house ; and, had it not
been for others, Etta would have lost
spirit and elasticity. Fortunately her
peculiar introduction to Sandwich, and
her beauty, had made " Hetty," as she
was generally called, the child of many
friends. They came for her, they sent for

her — not only Mrs Tilby, but Mrs Blean
and the skipper — and there was always
some little thing to take home with her —
a Dutch doll dressed on shipboard, or a
pair of warm socks knitted. Mrs Tilby's
gifts mostly took the practical shape of
frocks and bonnets. Even Fogge would
have wonderful sea-shells, or an orange in
reserve for " Hetty " when she ran to renew
acquaintance. And so much had Dr cunningham
been asked about her and her
mother by Mrs Rye, at the Black Mill,
that honos before he had ceased his attendance
on the broken leg, he had stopped
his horse at the Ashursts' door, and carried
the delighted child off in triumph before
him, to be exhibited as " Euretta the
Mermaids." She came back in high
glee, with hands full of cakes and posies,
to talk of the wonders of the mill, the
pigs and the chicks, and the lady who
kissed her, and said she must come again.
The vicar, comines to and fro occasionally,
and always with a preliminary knock
at the door, would bring her a picture-book,

or smooth her brown hair, and talk
down to her ; but of all her friends and
companions she had none to be compared
with the blind basket-maker and musician.

Refined and soft as was the voice of her
mother, there was a mournful cadence in
its undertones far from inspiriting to a
child ; but the blind man's voice ever sang,
as it were, a ringing peal of jubilant life —
a swelling anthem of praise. And whether
she took his hand to be led across the road
through the porch to the choir of the
dilapidated church, and her questionings
were answered in a reverent whisper that
"in a terrible storm nearly two hundred
years before, the church tower was blown
down on the roof, and the long rows of
pillars smashed," or that he " cannot tell
why they put up fresh pillars only along
one aisle," or " why sham pillars of rough
wood were put up instead of nice smooth
ones of stone along the other aisle," it is all
cheery and kind.

And whether together they wandered
after service like two children along the

quay and the walls, stopping at the Barbican
for a chat with Fogge by the way ;
or strayed away past the Black Mill, and
he explained why the huge sails, then
keeping Sabbath, went merrily round
before the wind on other days, to grind
corn into flour ; or bade her listen to the
melody of the skylark rising from the
meadow In the bend of the river, or to
the blackbird on a bramble, or to the
croak of the frogs, or to the harsh cra-cra,
crac-crac of a stray gannet seeking the
sea ; or laid a discriminating finger on
the wild-flowers she gathered, and straightway
gave her their names, all was fresh and
charming to her whose world had been
a floating barque on a restless waste of
sea.

Her questions were endless, and grew
with her growth ; and when at home her
mother had "the headache," or was "weary,"
or " busy," or could not " attend to her," she
slipped into the next room, where the blind
man was never too busy — even to explain
why all the baskets he made were crooked,

though the answer touched closely upon
his infirmity.

As time rolled on, through months and
years, Mrs Fleming, who had begun to
walk with a stick, had, thanks to the vicar,
three or four music pupils to vary the
monotony of stitching, and help them to
live.

Unless Euretta escaped to the basket-maker
and his wife, she was compelled
to sit still and silent during these lessons,
sometimes sewing a weary seam, until one
of the girls compassionately imparted the
new art of crochet, and then the busy
little fingers never seemed to find the time
long. What a joy it was to carry her work
for inspection by Will's sensitive fingers
and Mrs Ashurst's eyes! It was so much
more to her than her mother's languid
praise. After a time, so many customers
were there for the pretty and durable
trimming, that Euretta's crochet-hook was
kept almost in incessant motion. But of
education, as the word is understood, she
was having none, unless the check her

mother kept on her manners and deportment
might be counted, and the scraps of
knowledge she picked up by her own
inquiries and intelligence.

Not that Mrs Flemings a mother was
either unloving or inattentive ; but the
drudgery of life had come very hard to
her, and she spent in lamenting the past,
and looking forth on a dreary future, the
time she had better have given to brightening
the present.

Will Ashurst had made for " Hetty" an
alphabet of osiers, and syllabic lore had
come to her in play. He did the same
with numerals, and so she learned to count
and calculate small sums as a childish feat.
By the same means he early familiarised
her \vith musical notation, illustrating
sounds with his beloved fiddle. But it
vas not until the girl's tenth birthday that
the vicar — who had of late grown chary
of intrusion — taking a hint from his choir-master,
remonstrated openly with Mrs
Fleminof on the " too much work found for
Euretta's fingers, and too little for her head."

Oh, Mr Ushered, how can I help
it ? You know every shillings is of importance,
and children must be kept out
of mischief."

Yes," said he, looking down on the
pretty young face no longer set in a
widow's cap, as he rested one hand on the
square piano, and held his hat behind him
with the other, " but not to the detriment
of health or future welfare. You have had
a liberal education yourself, and it would
cost you neither time nor money to hear
a few lessons every day. Suppose her
grandfather were to relent, even on his
death-bed, you would surely not wish to
present an ignorant girl to society as your
daughter.'

Her face flushed, then paled.

Ah, sir, I have given up hope in that
quarter ; but I would not neglect Euretta,
superficial as I know my own education
has been, if I had suitable books or the
means to purchase them. She will need

some education even to earn her own

11)
ivmg.

And her Interlocutor saw that the widow's
eyes were suffused with tears.

Well, well, we will see what can be done
about books," said he, in a different tone, ashe
bowed himself out, and betook himself
straightway to fussy but kindly Dr cunningham's.


Old school books ! Ay, enough to
stock a library. In fact, every child of
mine has wanted a fresh supply, and the
others have been dismissed to the nursery
shelves, In all the disgrace of dogs-ears and
dilapidation. The Mermalden Is welcome
to the lot."

The suggestion thrown out so adroitly
by the vicar took full hold of Mrs Fleming's
mind. Nevertheless Euretta's education
proceeded after a somewhat desultory
fashion, with now and then a music lesson
thrown In, which blind Will was ready to
supplement long before he obtained permission
for her entrance into St Mary's
choir, permission not given by the reduced
gentlewoman without many a sigh. And
though Austin Ughtred stepped in occasionally

to examine and assist the progress
oi\{\?> protege, setting more than one heart
in a flutter during his catechism, he could
but shake his head when Euretta had
crossed the threshold of her teens, and say-she
possessed but the rudiments of a good
education.

For as every year had increased the cost
of her attire and maintenance, so did the
girl's own handiwork become of greater import
; and little was the time to be spared
for study or practice, whatever the vicar
might say.

He, good man, grew more anxious on
this account, as the winning, artless child
grew into a wistful, dreamy girl, and he
heard " our Hetty's beauty " praised by her
first friends around the Barbican, as a
something for Sandwich to be proud of,
something to make the girl's own fortune ;
and he took her improvement on himself
as a duty, giving her hints and lending
her books to be read aloud either to her
mother or Will Ashurst when work was
slack. She was apt and diligent. In a

year or two he was ready to reverse his
dictum.

It so happened that the fortunes of
Euretta and her mother had occupied his
mind no Httle of late, and at the very
time Captain AinsHe suggested to Pierce
Hathersage that her painted face would
make the artist's fortune, the clergyman
was asking himself if he might not promote
the fortune of the Flemings both, by a
journey to London and a personal interview
with Martin Copeland either in his home
or his city counting-house. He could surely
inspire the rigid merchant and father with
some of the pity he felt.

CHAPTER VI.

IN THE AMBER SATIN CHAIR.

HEN poor Mrs Fleming instructed
the vicar of St Mary's to enclose
his appeal to her father in another
to-her aunt, she was as
blind as Will Ashurst.

Mrs Norreys was an officer's widow,
with two sons and a daughter, and a very
small property apart from her pension to
live upon, when her brother invited her to
take charge of his household in Russell

VOL. II. A

Square, and of his own motherless girl,
then seventeen.

His proposals were liberal. For her
eldest son, Cecil, he purchased a lieutenancy
in his dead father's regiment, and
offered a seat in his own counting-house
for the other — his namesake ; for her
daughter Clara, all the advantages enjoyed
by his own child.

She seemed to expand with gratitude, as
the recipient of his favours ; and certainly
the dignity with which she carried her
inches, made people forget how few they
were.

Her brother was not tall, but he too
carried his head as if he had only to order
and be obeyed ; not offensively, but with
a natural dignity which sat well upon him,
and did not belie the benevolence of his
countenance, set in a bush of light whisker
and loose curls, into which silver threads
were creeping.

As a business man, he had not his rival
in the city. His sister was just as clever
a business woman in the house. She vied

with the father in spring her niece, indulged
her fancies and caprices, caressed
her as affectionately as her daughter Clara,
but she never let the reins of government
out of her own hands for an instant.

From the first she had planned a nice
little family union between her son Martin
and her brother's daughter Margaret ; it
would consolidate business and property
so compactly.

She meant no ill to her niece, she only
loved her so well she desired to have her
for her daughter.

It was a blow to her cherished plans
when, in spite of covert opposition, Carl
Fleming, one of the few sea captains who
had a seat at the merchant's table, was
allowed to marry Margaret Copeland.

Even then she had a hand in fettering
the pair with a promise she knew would
be soon broken. I will not say she had
any wilful hand in the breaking, but it is
certain her attempts to mollify the anger
of the father only tended to irritate him the
more.

She had, however, full credit for her
goodwill

And it is quite true that the young wife's
loving letters to her father were destroyed
or refused by him.

The affectionate aunt counselled patience,
promised intervention, but her intervention
was no more than a perpetual fan to keep
his cano-er at white heat.

Still he never went the leno-th of disinheriting
his daughter in favour of any child
of hers.

Yet Mrs Norreys lived in hopes. The
business capabilities of her son Martin were
leading to rapid advancement. The assiduities
of Clara were rapidly filling up the
void in the bereaved father's breast.

When lo ! like a thunder-clap came the
news that the Euretta had gone to pieces
in the great storm, and every soul on board
had perished.

What would Martin Copeland not have
given then to have revoked his own words ?

The intelligence came upon him on
'Change.

He staggered as if struck by a heavy
hand, and would have fallen had not
Martin Norreys been at his elbow to support
him.

The livid hue which overcast his clear
pinky skin was the talk of half the men on
'Change, and all sorts of rumours spread
before the day was out.

To Lloyd's," he whispered, hoarsely,
with white lips ; and, leaning heavily on
his nephew's arm, they turned thither, only
to have the statement confirmed.

Brandy and water were brought to him
in the captains' room, and then a passing
cab was called to bear him home to Russell
Square, leaving Martin Norreys as his
substitute on 'Change. He was a young
substitute, but a shrewd one.

A ticket-porter was despatched to Finch
Lane for the head clerk, with whom to take
counsel and share responsibility.

The blow which had fallen on their
principal had not paralysed them. One
or two good strokes of business were done,
and no blunders were made.

For three days Martin Copeland kept
his room, invisible to all but Smiles, his
old butler ; and what he suffered in those
days was known to none.

He blamed no one ; he knew of no one
to blame, except himself If he had only
forgiven his child, he would have been
resigned. He had been a brute to destroy
her filial letters — unanswered ! He was
punished, and must bear it, was all he was
heard to say.

From the time his daughter had left him,
the clerks had noticed a hard set about his
mouth, a drawing in of the grey eyes. They
only noticed when he went back to business
that these signs were deepened, and his
face less florid.

He commended his nephew and head
clerk for their business tact and shrewdness
; thanked them for their inquiries from
ship owners and underwriters respecting the
Etirettcv and those on board ; and in appreciation
of his modesty in consulting an
older head, held out a prospect of early
partnership to his sister's son.

Not all the decent — it may be remorseful
grief of Mrs Norreys at " the terrible
fate of her beloved Margaret," could disguise
her elation at the coming elevation
of her son, and she could scarcely keep
her satisfaction in the background.

She began to look higher for Clara than
the Captain Bolan of the Guards she was
so ready to encourage a week before ; and
to congratulate herself that a match had
not been precipitated.

It is only right to observe that neither
her son nor her daughter had any inkling
of her plans or her schemes, and that sofar
she had not done any deliberate act to
usurp Margaret Fleming's place for her
own children. More than six weeks had
gone by ; the first gloss was gone from
their mourning ; the restraint of an interdicted
topic, uppermost in the minds of all,
had passed away. No one spoke of the
lost ship or the lost lives.

Sittings at luncheon too-ether in the massively
but richly-furnished dining-room,
Mrs Norreys began to wonder how soon

she might venture to Hghten Clara's mourning
and receive guests.

A footman in black entered and handed
her a large letter on a silver salver. She
took it, scanned the superscription, in a
strange hand, and laid it calmly down by
the side of her plate unread. " Some
charity seeking a subscription," she concluded,
as she went on with her meal and
her chit-chat with Clara.

If Miss Ainslie chooses to wear crape
an absurd length of time for the major,
that is her affair, she is no criterion for us.
Besides, my dear, there is all the difference
between a distinguished brother and a
cousin discarded by her family — all the
difference in the world."

"Is it true, mamma, that Miss Ainslie
is left sole guardian of her nephew, that
boy at Sandhurst ? "

Quite true. I only wish Paul Ainslie
was ten years older, for he will be immensely
^•ich, and a good catch for somebody, some
day."

A light sigh told how Mrs Norreys

regretted the ten years' barrier between
Clara and the " brood catch " that was to be
"some day for somebody"

The conversation was taking an unpleasant
drift — Clara brought it back.

I suppose, mamma, there can be no
doubt that cousin Margaret was drowned ? "

Mrs Norreys caught her breath.

Doubt ! Clara, what a suggestion !
Did not your brother make every inquiry ?
Did not the two sailors say the boat was
swamped ? I am surprised at you ! "

So saying, Mrs Norreys rose majestically.
With the one hand she flung out
the folds of her betrayed silken skirt, the
other closed on the unread letter with an
involuntary grip, as she swept from the
room, designing to read it at her ease by
the drawing-room fire — such ease as Clara's
uncomfortable suggestion had left her.

So faint was the Sandwich post-mark
that it had been so far unseen. If it had
would it have borne any significance ?

The padded back of her amber satin
lounge rose between herself and the couch

whereon Clara had thrown herself, with a
book, as an excuse for thinking of Captain
Bolan.

With careless indifference Mrs Norreys
broke the seal, and let the enclosure drop
idly on her lap. " Dear Madam," she began
to read through her eyeglass, but ere
she had scanned a second line her indifference
was gone. The paper rattled in her
hand, her lips contracted, a leaden hue
overspread her countenance, she seemed
to shrink upon her chair.

With that letter all her ambitious plans
and projects seemed to shrivel and collapse.
The dead had come to life. The father's
heart had already been softened to receive
his discarded daughter, she knew. What
now would become of Clara's dowry, of the
fortunes promised to her sons ? No influence
of hers would be wanted for Mrs
Fleming, if once that enclosed letter
reached Martin Copeland's hand. — But,
need it ? — What was to be done ?

The voice of Clara broke the gasping
stillness.

From whom is your letter, mamma ? "

No answer. The question was repeated.

Oh, from a stranger. About someone
who is ill," with a strained attempt at indifference,
and a thankfulness for the screen
of the chair-back.

Someone ill ! Who is it ? "

No one you know, my child," impatiently.
" Only an old servant. Don't ask
so many questions,"

Clara subsided, wondering why the letter
should have made her mamma so cross.
But she did not see the enclosure slipped
into the pocket of that mourning robe.
Did not know what an awful contest between
rio^ht and wrongs was behoof fought
in the gorgeous arena of that amber satin
chair. Could not have divined what a
terrible decision was precipitated by her
idle question. Could not have dreamed
how the interests of herself and brothers
were being weighed in the balance against
the unfortunate offspring of the sorrowing
uncle to whom they all owed so much.
Could not have dreamed the cruel wrong

that was being silently perpetrated, under
the plea of maternal solicitude, when the
odour of burnt paper filled the room ; or
what an aching head lay back on that satin
chair when the irrevocable deed was done.

And scarcely had Mrs Norreys dreamed
what a torment the postman's knock in the
square would be to her for weeks and
months to come, or what manoeuvring
would be hers to have the first sight of all
letters brought.

But Satan is always ready with a hand
to help his friends farther into the mire.
Mrs Fleming's own pitiful letter to her
lather was delivered to Mrs Norreys, in
the square, several paces from the Copeland
door-steps.

A letter like this would fall among-st us
like a bomb-shell. I must stop it at any
risk," she said to herself, as she paced her
own room, in restless desperation. " But
how ? "

She had settled the question finally
before the last dinner-bell rang, and every
step she took as she descended the stairs

to meet her brother Martin told it. Oh
that she had but had ears to hear what
that decisive footfall said !

But it was not until months went by
she ceased to listen for the postman's
knock with fear and trepidation. And she
never wholly recovered her composure.
She began to be troubled with palpitation
of the heart, which she ascribed to the
shock she had received, leaving the interpretation
to others.

And she no longer opposed Clara's
marriage with Captain Bolan, contenting
herself with the settlement of the bride's
dowry upon herself ; the dowry of many
thousands, from the generous hands of the
bereaved uncle, whose own daughter was
stitching for a bare subsistence.

Almost immediately the firm became
Copeland & Norreys,' and in less than a
year Martin Norreys took another merchant's
daughter to wife and settled in
Kensino-ton.

Very little persuasion was needed after
this to induce the white-haired Mr Copeland

to quit the home of so many sad
memories and migrate to Kensington also.
And then, when the Russell Square landmark
was destroyed, Mrs Norreys breathed
more freely.

If her conscience was not wholly at rest,
her mind was. She moved in good society ;
her brother held her in honour. Her children
were settled and well provided for.

To that, however, came after a time one
demurrer. Cecil, still a lieutenant, grumbled
in no measured terms at the " awful hardship
of having to take orders from a lad
like Paul Ainslie," when at nineteen the
latter was gazetted " Captain by purchase,'
over his head. Both their dead fathers
had held rank in the same Hussar regiment,
and Cecil could but remember how
as a youth he had domineered over the
little fellow Paul.

A hint from the clever mother brought
Lieutenant Norreys to Kensington on
leave, and it only needed a little judicious
grumbling in the ever-accessible ear of
Uncle Copeland, and another opening of

the well-filled purse, to place Cecil Norreys
on a level with Captain Ainslie, alike in
rank and in pocket, at least while Paul was
a minor ; and Cecil was not one of those to
whom extra length of service, and twelve
additional years of age, would impart no
sense of superiority or importance.

Cecil's captaincy and increased allowance
filled up the measure of Mrs Norreys' self-approval.


As the years slipped away, so seemed to
slip the burthen of her secret from her conscience.
She took her brother's gradual
withdrawal from business, the silvering of
his hair, the stoop of his shoulders, as due
to the advance of years, not of the pressure
of her own slender white hand. And when
at length his will was made, and its provisions
openly discussed, she justified her
own act — the act which kept her brother
childless — in the crowd fortune it had
brought her children, and her grandchildren,
for they were rising up round her to call
her — what ^ Still, conscience was not
wholly dead.

More than eleven years had gone by
since the odour of burnt paper filling a
wide drawing-room proclaimed a deed of
treacherous cruelty ; and save the one
immediate appeal stifled with a five-pound
note, not a sign had been made in protest.
The nightmare of detection no longer
haunted her pillow, but the odour of burnt
paper ever brought back her fears — turned
her ghastly white, set her gasping, and
doctors failed to account for the symptoms.

And ready as she was to visit her friend
Miss Ainslie, when the genial maiden lady
spent the season in town, no inducement
was strong enough to draw her to Ainslie
Holt, the ancient and picturesque home of
the family. It was a fine Tudor mansion,
surrounded by grand old woods, where the
axe was seldom heard, and within the house
and without was all that might make a visit
desirable. But it was situated within a
few miles of Canterbury, and, to Mrs
Norreys, all Kent was Sandwich. She
dared not risk a meeting with the county
people and clergy Miss Ainslie gathered

round her, lest the Rev. Austin Ughtred
should be of the number, and her name
bring recognition.

She could never leave her brother,
and she took care that, when her brother
sought change of air and scene, it was faraway
from the Eastern coast, as terrible to
himself almost as to her.

She had ceased to fear, when, on the 5th
of September 1852, her son Martin's son,
Martin, was eight years old, and a juvenile
party celebrated the birthday of the little
heir of the great commercial house. A
Shetland pony had been sent to the boy
by his great-uncle Copeland, to supersede
the wooden rocking-horse in the nursery ;
but the old gentleman declined to be
present. He preferred to stay at home
and sit alone thinking — thinking of the
grandchild under the waves, whom he had
never seen, and might have seen and
cherished.

Mrs Norreys, the elder, that day had no
thought of other grandchild than her own,
for whom so proud a position was assured ;

VOL. II. B

and in all the dignity of her rich black
brocade and costly lace presided over the
festivities well pleased, as any other well-preserved
"good grandmother" might.
All at once she sank into a chair and
turned ghastly pale. The odour of burnt
paper filled the air. Little Martin had
thrown the paper wraps of his many
presents behind the low fire, and set them
ablaze. The festival was spoiled for her.
Her daughter-in-law had brought aromatic
vinegar and sal volatile. The unaccountable
attack passed. She had recovered
her composure, was following the joyous
troop of youngsters into the tea-room,
whither her son's wife had led the way ; a
footman arrested her progress with a subdued
message from her son, who had come
home from business and desired her immediate
presence in the library. The man
added that his " master looked ill."

What strange prescience was that which
made her shiver as she swept across the
lighted hall to meet her prosperous and
well-beloved son }

THE RESULT OF AN EMBASSY.

[Sandwich may be small as a
town, but it was too large to
retain a special interest through
a lapse of years in two individuals
of so little importance as Mrs
Fleming and Euretta, after the romance
and excitement of their introduction had
passed away.

Growth and the graveyard had obliterated
the memory of the great storm, and,
save to a few individuals, Mrs Fleming
had ceased to be anything but a seamstress
who had seen better days, and gave cheap
lessons in music.

To say that she had become reconciled
to her lot would be untrue ; but she had
accepted the unavoidable, and ceased to
wail openly over her misfortunes (it maybe,
shamed into submission by sightless
Will's cheerfulness), and had grown accustomed
to the familiarity of people who
fancied themselves her equals, and to
the patronage of those who considered
themselves her superiors.

Only three persons remembered what
she had been, and treated her still with the
respect and deference due to a lady ; the
couple with whom she lived, and the vicar
of St Mary's.

Dr Manningham had been kind to her,
had kept guard over the health of Euretta
and herself, disclaiming all suggestion of
fees ; but the fussy little doctor bustled
in and out with his silver snuff-box as if he
had earned the right to do so ; the vicar, fearful
of intrusion on one powerless to resent,
never went unless he had a good and sufficient
reason, and his stay was always brief.
Work and pupils had come to her chiefly

on his recommendation, but he did not
presume on that account. .

She, poor lady, who had a hungry craving
for other topics of conversation than
gathers and guests, back stitching and
feather stitching, crotchets and quavers, not
only for herself but for her imperfectly-educated
girl, counted these visits all too
few and short, and whilst seated beating
time for a pupil, or cutting out work in
front of the window, frequently found herself
glancing up Church Street, disappointed
if she chanced to see the vicar
coming along only to enter the church on
the belfry side.

It so happened on that sultry day, late in
August 1852, previously referred to, when
Euretta had gone to Stonar House with
parcels of completed work, that she looked
up from the button-hole she was stitching,
and it was with quite a little nervous flutter
that she saw through the open window the
advancing figure of the vicar, as with bent
head and hands behind him he came down
Church Street, and, passing the churchyard

gate, crossed the dusty road as if he had
the cottage In view.

She heard voices at the door, and then
the handle was turned, and, before her
little flutter had subsided, he passed round
the end of the screen (manufactured by the
Ashursts with osiers and paper, In delicate
recognition of her claim to privacy) accompanied
by Euretta, whose flushed face bore
signs of recent discomposure.

As the widow rose by the aid of her
stick, and, with a smile on her yet pretty
face, put forth her right hand to meet his
extended palm, he watched her eye travel
towards her daughter, and his salutation
was followed by the remark, —

I find Etta has been annoyed by the
impertinence of two strangers, who, not
content with staring her out of countenance,
took advantage of a stoppage on the open
bridge to make a sketch of her — at least
so she fancies."

Mrs Fleming's colour rose, she sank on
her chair grievously annoyed.

Oh, Mr Ughtred, this is the misfortune

o

of poverty. Every Jackanapes thinks himself
at Liberty to insuh a poor girl. Had
Etta been attired as a lady, no one would
have presumed to take such a liberty. I
hope they did not venture to accost you ? "
this to Euretta.

"No, mamma. The housekeeper had
given me a parcel of fresh work she wants
in a hurry, and she had asked me if I
would like to take a situation in Canterbury,
and I was all in a hurry to tell you,
when the bridge opened and I had to wait.
I was thinking about you and the housekeeper's
question, and saw nothing of them
until the bridge righted, though they must
have been there all the while. The one
was busy with his pencil when I caught
sight of them. I was off in an instant.
They might see I was vexed ; " and Euretta
left the room to remove her bonnet, and
tell her annoyance to her blind friend.

No sooner had she gone, than the vicar,
who had noted the proposed " situation "
for the girl, dilated on the desirability of
leaving no stone unturned to open out a

better prospect for her future than that
which necessity was almost forcing upon
her.

"A little business of my own will take
me to London at the close of next week,
and if I could, at the same time, serve you
by a call at Mr Copeland's, it would give
me pleasure to lay your case personally
before him, and, if he has any human feeling,
move it in your behalf and that of his
grandchild. If he could but see Etta, her
youth and beauty might accomplish more
than my words."

Mrs Fleming looked at him, with her
hands all in a nervous quiver, her eyes
dimmed with starting tears.

Oh, sir, if you could only prevail on
my father to pardon me, and receive my
child, you would earn my deepest gratitude,
but I fear he would not receive you. And I
should scarcely forgive myself if your errand
entailed any unpleasantness on yourself."

Have no uneasiness on that account.
We must not shirk our duty because it
may be unpleasant. If time has not removed

Mr Copeland's obstinacy, it may
have—" removed him, he was about to say,
but he stopped short. " Well, we will hope
for the best."

As the vicar left the place and Mrs
Fleming, in a greater flutter than he had
found her, he ran full butt against Mr
Tilby, hurrying, all excitement, to tell the
widow to " keep our Hetty indoors," because
two Rooshian spies wanted to " bribe
her " to go off with them. They had taken
a picture of her, and wanted to make a
fortune out of her. It was clear they meant
to carry her off. How did he know they
were Rooshian spies ? Why, old Fogge
had seen the one make pictures of the river
and the quay, and he had heard them talk
of Nicholas and Menschikoff, and ships of
war, and fleets sailing up the river, and
landing. It was clear as daylight, and if
Mrs Fleming didn't want Hetty carried off
to Rooshia by them furrin' spies, she had
best keep the lass at home. Moreover, he
said he had "seen the picture, and it was
as like Hetty as two peas."

It was useless for the vicar to argue in
defiance of Mr Tilby's eyes and ears.
Rumours of spies taking surreptitious
sketches of our harbours and fortifications
were current at the time, and so far he was
justified.

I wish I had that picture of Euretta
Fleming here," said the vicar to himself, ashe
stood in the rain on the narrow and
muddy footway of Finch Lane, on the 5th
of September, and raised one foot to the
first stone step of the frowning edifice,
marked by huge brass plates on either
door-post as the mercantile quarters of
Copeland & Norreys." Did he expect
the picture of youth and beauty to work a
miracle there ?

The inner door, set with plate-glass, and
guarded with a network of polished brass,
swung open lightly as he pushed, and he
found himself confronted by a line of busy
clerks at a long, high desk, also guarded
along the top by a brazen network. Nods
and winks were exchanged, and his quick
ear caught the whisper, " Parson wanting a

donation for his church," as the young clerk
he addressed answered, —

•' Impossible to see Mr Copeland. He
is not here, sir,"

When am I likely to meet with him If
I call ao-ain ? "

Mr Copeland never sees strangers, sir.
If you will leave your card and your
business — "

My business is with Mr Copeland, and
is private,"

Maybe so, sir, but Mr Copeland sees
no strangers. If you have called on behalf
of any charity, our manager — or perhaps
Mr Norreys might — "

Oh, to be sure ! you have a Mr Norreys
in your firm ! Can I see Jiini ? There is
my card,"

The clerk scanned the card and the
clerical cut of the owner, and still hesitated,

Will you please to take that card to
your principal. He seems as inaccessible
as the Grand Llama!" cried Mr Ughtred,
in some irritation.

The clerk pricked his ears at the word

Llama," and vanished. Llama was a cloth
in the market, and had a mercantile sound.

Back he came presently.

As you come about llamas, sir, Mr
Norreys will see you."

With a smile at the misapprehension,
the vicar followed the young man through
the manager's room to a second, richly
furnished with polished oak and crimson
leather to match the Brussels carpet.
Papers and bank-notes lay on the writing-table,
before the occupant.

Mr Norreys, a well-built man, within a
year or two of forty, rose, bowed, looked
up, and waited to hear the other speak.

"Mr Norreys, I presume, and Mr Copeland's
nephew."

The bow was repeated as an assent.

My errand here, sir, will, I think, excuse
this intrusion, and, I trust, obtain mean
interview with Mr Copeland. I come
as an ambassador from Mrs Fleming."

Fleming ? What Mrs Fleming ? " was
asked, in the perfectly natural tone of one
who needed enlightenment.

The name was a common one, and how
could a prosperous city man, immersed in
business, be on the alert for the mention
of a cousin over whom the waves of the
ocean and of time had swept so long !
She had been utterly dead to him and his
for many years.

Astonishment sat on the brow of the
good clergyman as he answered, —

Need you ask ? Mrs Carl Fleming,
the widowed daughter of Mr Copeland."

Are you dreaming, sir, or are you imposed
upon ? Mrs Carl Fleming was
drowned nearly twelve years ago," replied
Mr Norreys, with some stiffness and
hauteur.

The vicar stood for a moment confounded
by the cool assertion, made in
evident good faith.

Are you not aware, sir, that Mrs Fleming
and her child were both providentially
rescued, at the risk of a man's life, and
carried into Sandwich Haven ?"

Mr Norreys looked bewildered. " Be
seated, sir," he said then, " this is news tome.

And, really, I am scarcely prepared
to receive it. We had certain assurance
of their fate ; the boat was found keel
uppermost — really, after all these years — "
and he stopped.

This is some sham clergyman come to
extort money — or a benevolent noodle
imposed on, I must be wary," ran the
merchant's thoughts.

"Is the ignorance of this, Mr Norreys,
real or assumed ? " asked the vicar of his
own discernment, as he drew himself up
and said, " I do not understand your ignorance,
sir, seeing that both Mr Copeland
and Mrs Norreys were acquainted with
Mrs Fleming's rescue by Kit Blean, the
skipper of The Lass of Kent, and her
whereabouts at the time."

The business man was schooled to keep
his features under control, but here was
something which caused him to stare
blankly in his visitor's face, and drop into
his own chair as he asked, sternly, —

Have you any proofs ?"

Yes, Austin Ughtred had proofs, and

laid them before him. The shipowners'
letters first, and then — that which sent
Martin Norreys' blood back to his heart —
the curt, cruel, lying letter penned by his
own mother in disregard of a good
brother's secret agony, only to rise up
after long years in condemnation before
her own son.

Finch Lane is not a noisy thoroughfare.
In the subdued murmur of the city was
silence in which might have been heard
the laboured breathing of a man, the faint
rattle of well-saved paper.

The short letter took long to read. The
man of unblemished integrity, the son of
a British officer, the father of a (growing
son, sat as if paralysed, so narrow was the
strait between two, so prompt and decisive
must be his action.

The clear ring of his voice was gone
when he asked, without looking up, " Has
there been no communication since ? " •

None. Your cousin " (how the merchant
winced) " is not a woman of spirit,
and she succumbed without further appeal.

She has eked out a poor subsistence by
music lessons and needlework, almost a
cripple for many years. A sad lot, sir, for
one nursed in affluence. It is for the sake
of her daughter, Euretta, a mostly lovely
girl on the verge of womanhood, that she
now breaks the seal of silence, and accredited
me as ambassador to her father."

It is useless, Mr Ughtred," said Mr
Norreys decisively. "That letter" — it
was folded with a sharp rustle as he spoke
"rises as a wall between Mr Copeland
and his daughter. Its tone is conclusive,
as conclusive as the fact that I myself,
his partner, have been kept in the dark.
In short, Mrs Fleming's name is never
breathed in my uncle's presence. Of my
own regret it is needless to speak. I cannot
countervail Mr Copeland's injunctions.
And I cannot comprehend Mrs Fleming's
poverty. She had ten thousand
pounds on her marriage. They cannot
surely have gone to the bottom with the
captain?"

His books and papers did, and the

widow had, unfortunately, no knowledge
how or where his money was invested."

That was unfortunate and without remedy,"
said MrNorreys, rising and glancing
towards a black marble timepiece on the
mantelshelf. He handed back the letters as
an intimation that the interview must close.

The vicar also rose, with a sad consciousness
of failure, and a vague impression
that the man of marble face, bowing
him out so icily, was not as stolid as he
appeared.

Stolid ! No sooner had the door closed
upon the unwelcome visitor than Martin
Norreys flung himself upon a chair, and
buried his face in his arms upon the table-desk,
in agony unspeakable.

Stolid ! Was that man stolid who
whilst his dear son's young guests kept
high festival, confronted his mother in his
own library, with such an ashen, tortured
face, and answered her startled question,
What's the matter, Marty ? " with so
much bitterness ?

Ruin and infamy to all of us ! And

VOL. II. c

your doing — yours ! Oh! that I should live
to say it of the mother I have loved and
honoured ! " And he paced the floor in
the wildness of frenzy, as she stood there
before him in her rich attire, aghast and
speechless with her own fear,

Mother," said he, with forced composure,
catching her by the wrist and drawing
her away from the door, "did you know that
Margaret Fleming, the heiress to all these
goodly things " (he cast his eyes around)
had been for nearly twelve years stitching,
stitching for daily bread to keep life in
herself and child — a poor cripple wailing
the song of the shirt,' whilst we have
battened on luxuries that should have been
hers?"

No, no, Marty ; no, indeed, I did not,"
she interjected, in hurried trepidation.

But you knew, madam, that she was
alive and helpless, and dependent on the
charity of strangers, when you sent her
five pounds. Five pounds to mock her
misery, and cut her off, O my God !
from the father who was benumbed with

sorrow and remorse ; who would have given
all his wealth to clasp her in his arms once
more. Yes," he continued, with subdued
vehemence, from which she shrank and
recoiled, " the worthy clergyman, who has
been the good Samaritan to the poor
creature who fell among thieves, has laid
your letter before me ! Before me, on
whom the news of Margaret's rescue fell
like a thunderbolt ! What was I to do,
madam ? "

You did not surely admit — " she half
shrieked, falling on her knees at his feet.

"No, madam, to my eternal shame be it
spoken. I spared my mother, at the cost
of my own Integrity ; my peace of mind ;
my cousin's hopes ; her daughter's fate ; my
uncle's happiness — but only for the time.
The wrong must be righted, or I can never
look my uncle, my wife, or my innocent
children in the face again."

"Oh-h, Marty, Marty!" Mrs Norreys
cried, in anguish, " your words cut like
knives ! Your fortune, Cecil's, Clara's, hung
in the balance when temptation came upon

me suddenly, and I yielded. And then —
then, there was no retreat."

And, still upon her knees, clinging as a
suppliant to her son, regardless of rich
brocade or costly lace, she told the story
of the burnt letter, and all that followed of
remorse and fear ; but she strove to palliate
her wrong-doing by her maternal devotion,
and to warp his sense of justice to preserve
her fair fame and the fortunes of the
family.

You will surely not destroy us all ?
Bring disgrace on my grey hairs, and ruin
to your own children ? Can you not help
Margaret without an exposure ? Do not
be rash, Marty. I implore you, on my
knees, to have pity on me. Your uncle
would cast us all adrift in dishonour.
Think of Cecil. Of your wife."

And so she argued and worked upon his
feelings, until the man of unblemished
name, swayed and tossed by conflicting
shames and interests, consented to spare
his mother and himself, at the cost of his
own peace and honour.

AT THE VICARAGE AND THE MILL,

F St Mary's quaint old vicarage
has not been the growth of successive
generations, the long,
low building must certainly have
been constructed in those days when domestic
architecture was original, if not occasionally
eccentric ; when there was no
danger of mistaking your neighbour's
dwelling for your own. and no judging
its internal construction from the exterior.
And it is probable that its cheerful frontage
then was to the pleasant garden on the
west, and that the bare, blank length of
grey wall passed by our sad, weary, and

bespattered vicar on his way to his own
door on the evening of his return from his
unsuccessful errand to London, had been
so left as a shield from the keen east winds
as they came careering over the level flats
from the sea.

Anyway, he put his foot on the step of
his door, and after traversing a couple
of square halls, parallel with the lane,
leaving his hat and carpet-bag in the
second, with just a glance at the fresh
greenery visible through open doors and
windows on his right, he entered the
homely library, which also presented its
dead wall to the lane. It was a long room,
with the fireplace and a solitary window
both on his right, and two sets of bookshelves
sunk into the wall on his left,
where windows might else have been ;
the lowest of these shelves being apparently
devoted to ponderous folios.

He passed these, and made his way
direct for a mahogany bookcase at the
extreme end, which seemed designed to
prop up the low ceiling with its raised

crest. Unlocking the escritoire beneath
the ecclesiastical glass-doors, he drew from
his pocket-book the letters handed back to
him by Mr Norreys. For a moment he
hesitated, and turned his head over his right
shoulder towards the remote fireplace, as
if he would have flung the useless papers
to the flames. Fortunately his return was
unexpected, and the fire unlit, though
the evening was damp and chilly, so he
only thrust the letters as they were
into a small drawer, as if he would
shut them out of sight ; and, rocking
the escritoire, threw himself into an old-fashioned,
chintz - covered arm-chain between
the window and the square centre-table,
wondering his housekeeper had not
appeared.

He looked around. The room seemed
in strange disorder ; chairs were displaced,
the table-cloth was awry, the window-seat
littered, and — a key in a lock where no key
should have been.

Half of one imposing row of seeming
folios stood out boldly revealed as a door,

the concealed door of a small press which
did duty as a cigarette.

What, again /" he ejaculated, a look of
mingled pain and displeasure contracting
his benevolent features, as he touched a
gong upon the table. A little handmaid
answered the summons, and all in a flurry-told
him the housekeeper was on the diningroom
sofa, in a fit of some sort.

He strode across the hall to the diningroom,
an airy, well-lighted apartment
spreading farther out at the back, and
odorous then with something that was not
the perfume of the flower-garden. No
second france was needed to confirm his
suspicions ; the false key, the open press,
the empty decanters had told what sort of
a fit his housekeeper was in.

It was not the first time his wine and
spirits had disappeared mysteriously ; not
the first time he had found her unfit for her
duties ; but it was his first discovery of the
false key, the first time she had made so
distrusting an exhibition of her degradation
before her young assistant. She had been

forgiven more than once, on penitential
promises, by the charitable man. He was
not then in a forgiving mood ; he felt her
presence a stigma and a disgrace to the
vicarage.

A month later Mrs Fleming was installed
at the vicarage in her place, and yet not in
her place, for she was a woman of neither
education nor refinement, and her place had
been the kitchen ; Mrs Fleming was qualified
to preside at his table and receive his
few friends, an intelligent companion as
well as a housekeeper. His solitariness
was at an end. Her pinching and humiliation
were of the past. Yet those years of
stern necessity had taught her economy,
fitted her to rule over the one domestic,
and manage limited means — had almost
dried the fretful fountain of her tears.
There was no mistaking her position. She
was a salaried dependant, but she was
placed at the head of his small household,
and treated with all the reserve and respect
due to a gentlewoman.

It had come about quite naturally.

Austin Ughtred had gone most reluctantly,
on the morning after his return, to
dissipate all hope of her restoration to father
and home.

He had expected nothing less than an outburst
of tears and lamentations. Her tone
of mournful resignation was new to him.

Ah, sir," said she, " I knew it was hoping
against hope. My father must be
woefully changed to cherish his bitterness
so long. Well, we know now we have only
our own exertions to depend upon."

It appeared that Mrs Fleming was even
then perplexed with two proposals for
Euretta's services. Mrs Rye, of the Black
Mill, had offered her a situation as nursery
governess to her three youngest children ;
and a lady from Canterbury, visiting at
Stonar House, had proposed (through the
housekeeper) to engage her as young
ladies-maid.

The word " service " jarred terribly on
Mrs Fleming's sensitive nerves, though
Euretta, reared under widely different conditions,
had no such feelings. Yet so long

as a thread of hope remained of regaining-her
birthright, neither proposal could be
entertained.

That thread snapped, only a choice
between the two offers remained ; plain-sewing
had proved so poor a dependence
for two.

Many arguments determined the choice.
The word " governess " soothed the poor
lady's lingering pride. The comparative
proximity of the mill allayed the mother's
fear of separation ; Mrs Rye was a favourite
with Euretta, and no stranger ; the miller
and his family were of St Mary's congregation,
and she need not quit the choir.
Finally there was the clergyman's opinion
that Euretta was too young and inexperienced
to be sent out into the world,
away from her natural guardian.

Euretta and Mrs Rye were content.
Not so the housekeeper at Stonar, she
was huffed, and declared that not another
stitch of work should Mrs Fleming have
from her.

The death of hope, the loss of her

daughter and of her chief customer all at
once — for the old housekeeper represented
the family patronage — put the widow into
great tribulation.

This came to the ears of the vicar,
through a casual word of solicitude and
sympathy from blind Will, after choir-practice
one evening at the vicarage.

The vicar pondered. At length —

I am losing my old housekeeper, Mr
Ashurst. Do you think Mrs Fleming
would be willing to accept the post ? "

Ay, right-down glad I'm sure, sir. I
believe she worships the very ground you
tread on, and she's in sad straits now."

A faint smile flickered on the vicar's
face. The smile was lost on Will, but not
the sigh which prefaced his grave reply,
I do not seek a worshipper, I only want
a faithful comptroller of household matters
under this roof."

Ay, ay, sir, I understand. But, heart-service
is better than eye-service, I take it.
I meant no harm."

So it came about that the basket-maker

and his wife lost their lodger, and Austin
Ushered saw his mother's work-table
back in the vicarage.

It was a serene haven to the doubly
shipwrecked woman, and as days and
months went by, peace smoothed away
the lines pinched in her face by the sharp
fingers of struggling necessity.

As for Austin Ughtred, well, he soon
learned the wide difference between heart-service
and eye-service.

Euretta, who had long dreamed of a
future when she, by her own endeavours,
limit relieve her mother's weight of care
and toil, was inwardly delighted at the
change ; though, not being demonstrative,
she said little beyond a few words of
thankfulness in the ears of her blind friend.

She said less of satisfaction at her own
change ; though in many respects it was
better for her than she knew. Mrs Rye
was a fresh, cheery woman, always looking
on the bright side of things ; there could
be neither moping nor melancholy in her
presence. The miller, too, was hearty and

genial, and so were his two stout sons who
worked in the mill with him, and thought
it good fun to tease " Hetty " whenever she
came in their way. Two girls were away
at school, but " Hetty " found the three
lively little romps in her charge quite as
much as she could manage. She had been
doubtful of her own competence to instruct
the eldest, aged eight, but she speedily
discovered that she was more of a nursemaid
than a " governess," and that lessons
were the least part of her duty. Active
and energetic Mrs Rye, bustling about
with her one plump maid-servant, with
poultry and pigs to feed, and a cow to milk,
seemed to think the hours devoted to books
so much time wasted. There was no room
set apart for study, and no sooner had
Euretta grouped the three around her ina
corner of the big kitchen, and secured
their attention, than there was a call for
Hetty " to go somewhere, or do something,
quite incompatible with teaching.

It counteracted the girl's somewhat morbid
tendency to sit and dream, if it did not

advance her pupils, and was a healthy reaction,
if not altogether what she had expected.
In any case, both mind and body
were invigorated with the chancre. Exercise,
abundant and good food, fresh air and
plenty of it, all did their strengthening
work.

Yet there were times during the winter
when so much of that same " fresh air "
came with a rush and a roar over the wide
expanse of meadow, marsh and river, to
tear at the sails of the tall, black mill, and
batter at the windows of the square, red
house beside it, as filled her with shuddering
remembrances of a child's terror, and
made her wish for calmer quarters, or at
least to escape the laughter of young
Reuben and Dan at her white-faced fear.

There was, however, not much danger
of her running away from the jests and
banter of the young men, so long as the
miller and his wife treated her with so
much homely kindness, and the children
returned her attachment so heartily — or,
while the really good pianoforte in the best

parlour was free to her fingers, and she was
granted leisure to practise day by day, on
the sole proviso that she taught " Nelly
her notes " — or while the good miller,
smoking his pipe by the fire on the long-winter
evenings after the children were put
to bed, asked her to sing and play for him
as if she had been one of the family, and
seemed to listen with pleasure — or while
she was permitted to go to the vicarage
week by week for choir practice, and Will
Ashurst, to whom the dark or the light
were as one, and for whom the wild road
had no pitfalls, invariably went as her
protector homewards.

There had been one drawback to
Euretta's content ; a great one to any
girl of her age, with any claim to respectability
— her appearance. Mrs Tilby had
long ceased to supply her with bonnets
and frocks. (She had worn her own last
garment, and shared the narrow bed of
her lost little one three or four years).
Mrs Fleming's slender means had not
kept pace with the girl's growth. She

had a general consciousness of shabbiness
when she went to church on a Sunday ina
faded coburg, all the more oppressive
from contrast to the over-trimmed satins
and merinos of the Eyes.

Her own earnings had not done much
to remedy the deficiency, and the half-worn
green merino gown Mrs Rye had
offered " Hetty " for translation before
Christmas was but a poor substitute fora
new one.

When lo ! as if by the touch of a fairy
wand, Cinderella was arrayed from head
to foot.

In Christmas week the postman brought
a letter for "Mrs Carl Flemino-l" The
first in all the years she had spent in
Sandwich.

A letter did I say ? Nay — a note !
a ^20 Bank of England note, folded ina
blank sheet of paper, with nothing but
the address on the envelope and the
London postmark as a clue to the
sender!

Mrs Carl Fleming, Sandwich, Kent,"

VOL. II. D

was all the address, and the handwriting
was unknown.

Conjecture exhausted itself on the compunction
of a trio — her father, her aunt,
her cousin.

Was it for her ?

The postmaster assured her there was
no second Mrs Carl Fleming in Sandwich.

Should she use it ?

'* Ay," said the vicar, "it is clearly your
own. Whether sent in compunction, or
compassion, or restitution, it is yours."

Plain and inexpensive was the new
attire of both mother and daughter, but it
was new, and seemed to impart a something
that had been wanting of self-respect
and self-command. That it gave freshness
to the face of the mother and set off the
youthful charms of the daughter goes without
telling.

It inspired the latter with sufficient quiet
firmness to secure a defined time and place
for lessons.

And either that or something else seemed
to inspire the miller's sons with an idea

that Hetty might prefer a younger escort
than blind Will on her way from choir-practice.


But "Hetty" clung to her old friend, and
either did not or would not see their drift,
although she remarked to him that " Colin
and Dan were more civil than they used
to be."

About her sixteenth birthday, in February,
another bank-note came as mysteriously,
again in April, again in June, in
September, and so on every two or three
months, whilst the year wore gradually
away, and the next took up the round,
briofhteninor Mrs Flemings fair face with
hope and expectancy. Years seemed to
have dropped from her in the months she
had spent under. the vicarage roof, and
since that first bit of crisp bank-paper filled
her eyes with wonder and tears of joy.

The years that had slipped from the
mother might have fallen on the daughter.
Not that in growing taller and older she
had grown less beautiful or graceful, but
that a singular reserve and retiring dignity

UNIVERSITY OF
tLLINOIS LlBKm

of manner seemed to Invest her as with a
mantle, and her natural stability of character
to become more pronounced. It was remarkable,
inasmuch as it came upon her
suddenly, and not by gradual development.


What makes you so sober this morning-hetty
} You have scarcely spoken a word
all breakfast time. It is not any of Colin
or Dan's nonsense, is it ?" asked Mrs Rye,
as she folded the table-cloth, and noted the
girl's abstraction whilst gathering her pupils
around her one sunny summer day, when
the perfume of roses, mignonette, and fresh
hay came in through the open windows
and doors.

Oh, no ; I've had a curious dream, that
is all."

All } And quite enough if it's to last
all day. You might be dreaming now.
Give yourself a shake, and waken up, my
dear. There's no heed to be given to
dreams," said Mrs Rye, with hearty good
nature, and without evincing any curiosity
respecting the nature of the dream.

And Euretta was not voluntarily communicative.


Have you been dreaming again, my
dear ? " asked Mrs Rye quizzically, a few
days later,

Yes," was the sole response.
The querist noted a faint flush on
Euretta's cheek, but whether at her own
unsympathetic " Umph ! " or at the dream,
she had no skill to determine.

Some time after that, like symptoms
caused Mrs Rye to say, —
Dreaming again, Hetty ? "
Yes ; and always the same dream,"
and there was no mistake now about the
flush upon the cheek.

Then I tell you what, you had best
take a dose of herb-tea, or go and talk to
Dr Manningham. When people dream
by day, and dream by night, and always
the same dream, it's a sign they want
physic. Unless — " and she looked intently
at the girl, " unless when lasses
have begun sweethearts. Perhaps you
have a sweetheart ? "

Oh, no," said Euretta calmly.

Mayhap our Colin or our Dan — "
put the mother apprehensively.

Oh dear, no ! "

And so conclusive was the " Oh dear,
no," that Mrs Rye could only move away,
muttering to herself, —

She micrht do worse, and so might
they. I wonder what the lass does dream
about."

But she never again asked the question,
and was never told.

Whatever it was, it exercised a potent
influence on the mind of the ripening
woman ; changed the tenor of her life,
and was, maybe, answerable at an after date,
for a convulsion in the family of the Eyes,

Her teaching had all along been a
labour of love — she was learning as well
as teaching ; and when lessons were over
she had been ready for a romp in the
meadows with the children, as if only an
elder child. But now she had always
a book in her pocket, or in the little fancy
basket Will Ashurst had made for her,

and read assiduously whilst they disported
themselves. The books came from the
well-selected library of the good vicar, and
were pored over in the early morning,
before even that early-rising family were
astir. Then she volunteered to read The
Kentish Gazette aloud to the miller whilst
he smoked his pipe, and, as she read the
momentous news of the time, others
clustered round to listen, and the two
young men watched her expressive countenance
with an interest not altogether
brotherly.

Dan, a corporal in the Kentish militia,
a good-humoured, frolicsome fellow, with
deeper feelings than anyone gave him
credit for, did not cease to plague and
banter her, hide her books, or laugh at
her studious fit, or upset her work-basket
(another of the blind man's gifts), run
down the stitches of her crochet, or pick
the labels off her cotton-reels ; but he no
longer did so without a sharp rebuke from
Colin, the grave and steady one of the
family, not always taken in good part ;

and she must have been blind not to perceive
that whithersoever she went, with
her pupils or without, one or other of the
young men was sure to cross her path, or
to follow her and linger.

Had she been a coquette, nothing would
have pleased her better ; as it was, she felt
more annoyance than gratification, and it
was anything but a pleasure to her to find
their eyes turned towards the low gallery
of the choir on a Sunday instead of towards
the pulpit. She was afraid it would
attract the attention of others, and be sure
to irritate the miller and his wife if they
were to notice ; yet, situated as she was,
she had no means of escape. The young
men seemed to think that long acquaintance
and her position under their father's roof
formed a ground for closer association than
she was disposed to permit, and each in
his own way resented her attitude of
persistent reserve.

All this made her uncomfortable,
although, unwilling to disturb her mother,
she kept her growing disquiet to herself.

One day, passing close to the mill, she
accidently overheard, through the open
upper door, the angry voices of Colin and
Dan in loud altercation, each accusing the
other of seeking her favour by underhand
means, and of prejudicing her against
himself.

I cannot stand this," she said to herself,
as she hurried on her errand ; " it will
never do for me to remain here and sow
dissension between too good brothers. It
would be making a very poor return for all
the kindness of Mr and Mrs Rye. If they
would only be content to treat me as they
did when first I came, it would be all right ;
but I am not inclined to be whispered to by
Colin, or to be kissed by Dan, and what
they call ' pride my mother would call
propriety.' They are both good-looking
young men and well enough in their way
but — a — well I don't think I am destined
to spend my life in a mill ; and it's no fault
of mine if I cannot fall in love with either
of them. But it would be a fault to stay
here now I know they are quarrelling about

me, seeing that I could never marry either
of them. Perhaps I have already stayed
too long, for my own sake as well as theirs.
Mother seemed quite distressed last Sunday
when she said that I was losing my little
refinement, through associating only with
under-bred people. I wonder if she was
right In thinking that my tone of voice
was altering. And, oh, I wonder if Dr
Mannintrham could recommend me to a
higher-class family ? or the vicar ? But
higher-class people require higher-class
qualifications ; and will very likely look
down upon me. Well, I cannot expect
to be treated as I am at the mill. I shall
be loth to leave them all, it has been like
a home to me, but — there is no help for It
I must go."

And so she cogitated as she went her
way along the brown road and over the
Delf-bridge and past the old Grammar-school
into the town, with a very sober
face that flushed and paled with varying
emotions, her lustrous, dark-grey eyes

more than once dim with moisture, though
it never rounded to a tear.

Yet she never wavered, and her purpose
grew and strengthened with every
step she took. She had a definite end in
view had the seventeen years' girl, though
the secret lay hidden in her own young
breast ; the question uppermost in her
mind was how to attain it, as, indeed, it
had been for many months.

A tiny ball came rolling to her feet that
very day as if by chance. She took it up
without hesitation, little wetting what
momentous issues lay coiled within its
sphere.

THE DAY DREAMER.

[Betty ! " cried Nelly, running
to meet her with outstretched
arms as she approached the
mill on her return about noon,
Hetty, mother says we may go to the
Castle blackberries, this afternoon, if you
will promise to keep us out of danger.
You will, won't you ? "

Nelly's younger sisters close at her
heels pointed the we, as they clustered
round "Hetty" in high glee at the
anticipated holiday.

Euretta gave the desired promise
'readily, but conditional on obedience and

good behaviour, and the assent of the
farmer who occupied the land,

Oh, Farmer Bradley has cut his
wheat, and father says he won't mind,"
said Nelly, and that was supposed to settle
the matter.

Richborough Castle was not more thana
quarter of a mile away from the Black
Mill on the north-east, and the wheat
which had been cut and carried had grown
upon the high cliff within the wide quadrangle
enclosed on three sides by the
ruined walls of King Ethelbert's palace,
walls so strongly built by Roman and
Saxon hands as to defy Time, had not the
ruthless torch and mattock of the Danish
invader done Time's work for him.

On the eastern side was no indication
of wall. When the Romans planned and
raised their stronghold, the tall cliff and
the sea which rolled almost to its very
base would be its best protection. But when
Euretta took her three little pupils thitherto
gather blackberries, the inland cliff was
clothed with a rich growth of bushes and

brambles, ash trees and birch, that had for
many generations served to charm the eye
and rob the hoary ruins of their grimness.

A dry and dusty road, which had forages
forgotten the wash of the sea, led
their feet below the high bank to the
picturesque farm-house nestling securely
under shelter of the once formidable walls
at the north-eastern angle, and when
Euretta and the children approached the
farm-gate, two open carriages were standing
before it. There she brought the
children to a standstill also.

A party of strangers stood on the other
side of the gate, and one middle-aged
gentleman was expatiating to the rest
on the probability that the farm-house
occupied the very spot " without the
walls " warily assigned to St Augustine
by King Ethelbert, where he and his
Woden-worshipping followers might listen
to the foreign monk's strange gospel, without
danger of the demoniac enchantment
possible under a roof. She and the children
listened to the earnest little antiquary

in polite patience, waiting until his party
had bent their backs to the steep ascent to
the ruins, and under his leadership, passed
between the double line of wall, before
they entered the farm-yard and obtained
from the farmer's wife the leave to "go
blackberries," which neither the miller
nor his wife had considered a necessary
preliminary.

The children grew impatient, for the
antiquary and his friends blocked the
narrow passage, whilst he, to prove his
theory that it had been a covered way easily
defended, pointed to hollows in the ivy-clad
grey walls where beams might have
rested ; but the same good breeding which
had withheld Hetty from stripping blackberry
bushes without leave, caused her to
hold the eager little girls in check, until a
gap in the wall on the right hand might
free them.

Before that occurred one of the ladies observed
them, and made way for the children
and their attendant to pass; at the same time
requesting a younger lady to do the same.

Thank you, ladies," said Hetty, as she
sent on the children in single file before
her, accompanying the simple words with
an inclination of the head so graceful as to
arrest attention.

That is a very polite young person,"
observed the elder and taller lady, who
wore a white Paisley scarf-shawl over a
black silk dress, and a row of old-fashioned
crisp curls under the white lining of her
black satin drawn bonnet. " Did you notice
how gracefully she acknowledged our little
act of courtesy ? "

Yes, Miss Ainslie, and how she keeps
those children in order, too," assented the
other, raising her gold eyeglass, and following
their retreating figures with an
aspect of perplexity. "It occurs to me I
have seen the young woman before, somewhere
; her features are quite familiar."

Well, she has a face not to be easily
forgotten," said Miss Ainslie. " There is a
kind of pensive beauty about it very uncommon.
Just the sort of face one sees
in a picture. By-the-bye, Paul showed tome

— Be careful, Mrs Bemerton, or
you will step on your thin dress and tear
it ! " The broken sentence remained unfinished,
and what Paul had shown her was
not told.

The caution was needed. They had
reached the confined key-shaped outlet,
where the Rye girls had disappeared, and
were stumbling between rugged walls, over
risings g-round so much more ruQ^cred as to
suggest the existence of steps in the dim
ages of antiquity. Then, the skirts of the
period were worn not only very full from
the waist downwards, but long enough to be
imperilled by an incautious foot ; and when
they emerged from the short angular passage
into the open area within the walls,
there was a long rent between the stripes
of the delicate white and blue gauzy bal-marine,
which hung like a stirrup in front.

Dear, dear, how provoking ! This
comes of joining Bemerton's antiquarian
expeditions."

"In unsuitable garments, my dear,"
quietly added her husband, who had been

VOL. II. E

close enough to overhear. " You can pin
it up for the occasion, and when we get
home I can add the dress to my museum
of antiquities."

Antiquities indeed ! It is a new
material ! "

Ah ! converted by a touch into an
old gown," quoth he, drily.

Matrimonial sparring would not repair
the damage. Three ladies could only
furnish a single pin, and when Mr Pemberton
carried off his male friends across the
stubble field to explore the subterranean
puzzle in the centre, known as St Augustine's
Cross, he left his wife, ruefully pinning
the one long loop into two short ones.

By this time Euretta and the children,
in their clean sun-bonnets, had crossed the
field, with their little baskets, and the
miller's walking-stick, which she had
brought to drag outlying brambles within
safe reach of little gatherers ; for, be it
understood, they grew on the verge and
steep of the precipitous bank, where a
careless step meant a dangerous fall.

Mrs Bemerton, In quest of pins, instinctively
glanced across at the blackberry
hunters, whose merry calls and laughter
she could hear. As Instinctively she
picked up the long loop of tattered skirt,
and hastened towards them.

Can you oblige me with a pin or two }
I have torn my dress," said she to Euretta,
who turned on the instant.

Certainly, madam ; but a stitch or two
would be better." Straightway, as if It
were the most natural thing in the world,
Euretta wiped her stained fingers on a dock
leaf, and with a word to bid the children
play In the field " until she was ready, she
took an old-fashioned 
from her pocket, and, kneeling on the
grassy border, repaired the disaster with
the neatness and celerity of a practised
gentlewoman.

As she rose to her feet, Mrs Bemerton,
who had eyed her curiously the while, after
thanking her, remarked, " Those children
are very obedient. Are you their sister or
their nurse ? "

"Their nursery governess," said Euretta,
with a sheet flush,

"Can we come, Hetty?" cried Nelly.
Are you ready ? "

"Hetty?" repeated the lady. "You
are surely not the young girl I saw at
Stonar House two years ago, when I
required a maid for my daughters ? "

Yes, madam. My mother thought me
too young then to go so far away. But
now, if such a situation were offered me, I
should be glad to accept it ; that is," she
corrected herself, " as soon as Mrs Rye
can supply my place. I have not yet said
I wish to change."

So, she is not being dismissed," thought
Mrs Bemerton, " and she was highly
commended to me. Rose does not suit
me at all, and this young person might be
willing to hear the little ones their lessons
now and then, as well as take charge of
the wardrobes of Florence and Maud. I
might dispense with a resident governess
then." And so, being like Johnny Gilpin's
wife, of "a frugal mind," she put the

question of willingness to " Hetty ; " to be
answered readily enough in the affirmative.

The children were becoming impatient,
and Euretta saw it. Respectfully, but
decidedly, she gave the lady, who continued
her catechism, to understand this.

Excuse me, madam, the children demand
my care. My time is not my own.
I must refer you to Mrs Rye of the Black
Mill for anything more."

The youngsters came back to the blackberries
; the lady returned to her friends,
simply remarking that Hetty would most
likely hear from her.

Children have sharp ears and ready
tongues. Nelly went back to the mill
with her head full of the lady who had
torn her dress, and "wanted Hetty to go
and live with her."

This precipitated an explanation, so far
at least as reo-added Euretta's desire to
leave the mill. Mrs Rye was angry with
the stranger for " unsettling the lass's
mind," and with "Hetty" for "being so
ready to leave old friends for strangers,"

Her mother and the vicar were equally
surprised, and advised her to remain where
she was ; but Will Ashurst, though he said
he " should lose the sweetest voice in his
choir if she left Sandwich," quite approved
her intention to quit the miller's roof. He
had not been her escort home so long without
an inkling that the miller's sons were
the primary cause of her desire for change.

They, in their eagerness to prevent her
departure and win her to remain, made love
to her in downright open earnest, and so
persecuted her in their different ways that,
if there had been no romantic ideal in her
own mind, they would still have defeated
their own aims. As it was, she hailed
with thankfulness the letter sent by Mrs
Bemerton, ten days later, which led to her
removal to Canterbury about the middle of
October. And Mrs Rye, whose eyes were
opened to the jealous rivalry and hopeless
attachment of her two sons, was no longer
anxious to retain her.

The girl had anticipated a flood of tears
and lamentations from her mother, whose

mysterious income was at the root of what
Httle opposition she made. Indeed, she
was hoping better things for both ; but
whether time had taught her composure,
or she had become accustomed to Euretta's
absence, or she was herself so content and
comfortable in all respects as no longer to
need the solace of her daughter's frequent
presence, she bore the parting, In the little
square hall of the vicarage, with more
equanimity than had been looked for ;
shedding tears of course, but not a deluge.

Her only insistance was that " there was
no longer a necessity for her daughter to
take an inferior situation."

The Canterbury coach took up Euretta
and her box at the end of the bleak road
leading to the Black Mill, and as she was
whirled away, she carried with her a vision
of friendly faces and waving hands ; so
many were there to see her off; Will Ash-hurst
and his wife amonof- the rest.

What she had left behind her she knew,
or thought she did ; what lay before her
she knew not. The sadness of many partings

began to oppress her, and she also
began to have miso;ivinors that she had not
been altogether wise in changing the known
for the unknown. But she leaned back,
looking out of the coach-window with that
old dreamy expression in her wondrous
eyes, as if questioning the far-off future, lost
to the present, and oblivious of her three
fellow-passengers, whose talk was all of the
war in the Crimea, and the movements of
our troops.

She had no vision, not she, of the fierce
strugfo-le between contending armies abroad,
or that other fierce struggle nearer home
between the miller's two sons, each accusing
the other of driving her away from the
mill. She could not see how words came
to blows, or how the light-hearted banterer
Dan, worked up to fury by the bitter taunts
of Colin, snatched up his floury cap and
without a word of farewell to father or
mother was off through the streets of Sandwich
as if spurred by demons, only pausing
to take breath when what had been Sandown
Gate was left behind, and he stood alone on

v)

the bare Deal road, and then kept doggedly
on, on, even through the town till the barracks
at Walter received him, to be heard
of no more until the Kentish militiaman was
a soldier, duly attested and enrolled.

She saw nothing of this, or it would indeed
have saddened her to think that the
step she had taken to preserve harmony in
the family of the Ryes, had only precipitated
the collision she feared. The attentions,
the love of the two brothers, so
differently shown, had filled her, not with
exultation, but distress, and, could she have
known of their final quarrel and its result,
she would have felt it a crowning disaster.
She had experienced nothing but kindness
from the miller and his wife, and she had
meant to do them a good turn — not an ill
one, in quitting them.

By-and-byher wandering thoughts came
home; she took note of things upon the road.
The tramp with his bundle on a stick, the
children by the cottage door, the itinerant
tinker at work, the loitering gipsies on
nooks of greensward, the thinning hedgerows,

the red and yellow leaves, the clouds
that flecked the sky and flung their shadows
over grass and stream were no longer lost
to her; and her ear was open to an animated
discussion of the relative merits of two
Hussar officers named Ainslie and Norreys,
who had distinguished themselves in the
recent passage of the Alma.

Captain Ainslie was evidently, from the
conversation, a Kentish landowner, as were
his two partisans, who maintained that
there never was a finer man nor a finer
soldier than old Major Ainslie, and that the
son took after him ; and that the airs
Captain Norreys had given himself when
his regiment was stationed at Deal the previous
year, needed some soldierly bravery
to carry them off. A taste of actual service
might take the conceit out of him, — and
so on.

One word had caught Euretta's attention.

Norreys! that was surely the name of
her mother's aunt, and she had a son in the
army, — could this Captain Norreys be her
own cousin?" It never occurred to her

simplicity that the name was common and
the army-Hst a long one. She listened to
one disparaging anecdote after another,
only the more convinced that he must be
one of those Norreys who had been so
cruel to her poor mother.

Presently the other passenger struck in, —

"You had Pierce Hathersage, the artist,
staying among you in Deal a summer or
two back, I understand. He brought
home a number of local sketches and commissions
from the officers at the barracks.
And now I hear he has been sent out to
the Crimea by one of the illustrated papers.
Well, he will be quite in his element."

Insensibly the listening girl associated
this Pierce Hathersage with self-sufficient
Captain Norreys, and the sketch made
upon the bridge, and her old indignation
revived within her. If she thought of the
Captain Ainslie so freely eulogised, it was
but to take for granted that he would not
have countenanced the artist's boldness.
What would have been her thoughts had
she known that even whilst she was being

bowled alone the Canterbury road towards
another phase of servitude, with her dreamy
eyes looking out on denuded hop gardens,
stacked poles, and queer-capped hop-drying
oats, and her memory was sent back
by strangers to an artist sketching on
Sandwich Bridge with an officer by his
side — that her grandfather Martin Copeland,
resting on the arm of his nephew
Martin Norreys, was standing in front of
a print seller's in Cheapside, London,
intently gazing on the finished picture ?

Yet by that duality, or affinity, or coincidence
which so strangely influences human
attains, it was so.

The white-haired city merchant had
taken to picture collecting of late years, to
fill up the vacuum in his heart and home.
He was given to scan the dealers' windows
as he passed.

His attention had been arrested by a fine
oil-painting, the central figure of which was
a young girl with a basket at her feet, leaning
back against the parapet of a long
bridge with her head upraised and large

dreamy eyes looking at something between
sky and river — that was neither. The
atmosphere seemed to glow with heat ;
there were other figures in the distance,
quaint riverside buildings, and a queer
old gateway that seemed half plank, half-stone,
and in the hazy perspective might
be caught a suggestive gleam of the .


But Martin Copeland for once saw none
of the accessories, he saw only a face, the
face of his long - lost Margaret, idealised
and beautified by the painter's art, but still
her face as he saw it framed before him in
the day, and nightly in his dreams.

It was useless calling his nephew's attention
to the strange resemblance, he either
did not or would not see it.

Nonsense, uncle, there is more power
and character in that face than in Margaret's
; besides, the hair and eyes are
darker ; " and he would have drawn his
uncle away.

Pshaw ! those are small matters ! I
tell you I have seen that expression upon

Margaret's face scores of times when Carl
was away at sea, both before her marriage
and after. The precise shade of eyes or
hair has nothing to do with the expression.
It has touched my heart, Martin, as if my
girl had come before me in a peasant's
garb. I must ascertain who is the artist,
and where he found his model."

Martin Norreys, the soldier's son, might
have told him had he been so minded.
Many a time and oft in his boyhood, when
his father's regiment was stationed at Deal,
had he and other officers' sons scampered
over the sand-hills to Sandwich, and
watched the bridge swing back to let a
vessel through.

All the benevolent vicar had told him of
his cousin's poverty and her daughter's
beauty came back to sear his conscience
as with a branding-iron. It was with a
feeling of desperation he followed his
uncle into the shop in order to hear the
worst, and make the best of it.

Mr Copeland was well known to the
dealers. As his questions were answered

one by one, his junior partner drew his
breath more freely.

"the Day Dreamer' is by Pierce
Hathersage."

We cannot tell where you will find the
artist now, sir. His studio is closed. He
has gone out to the Crimea with our army.
There is no telling where he found his
model or his scene. Mr Hathersage sent
the picture to us in a hurry, on the eve of
his departure, with a price upon it."

And that is— "

Seventy guineas, sir."

I'll take it. Send it home."

Had they asked a hundred Martin
Copeland would have thought it cheap.
His daughter Margaret seemed appealing
to him from the canvas, and he forgot
how years had sped since the same girlish
look was hers. All he cared to learn was
how the accidental likeness came there 'i
Who was the artist's model ?

DRAWING NEARER.

IAD a ghost risen up before Mrs
Norreys, she could not have
been more scared than when
Pierce Hathersage's picture was
sent home.

She felt like the prisoner in the mechanical
iron cell, seeing the walls and roof
shrink and grow nearer day by day, withall
the appalling presentiment of certain
doom.

Was not Sandwich bridge and gate as
well known to her as to her sons. If conscience
had slept long, had not Sandwich
been a hideous nightmare to her for the

past two years ? Was her memory such
that she could not trace the lineaments
and the parentage of the girl depicted
there so livingly ?

Was she not thankful no one else was
present when the dealer's man removed
the green baize covering and set the paintings
well in view ?

She was indeed. The eyeglass dropped
the quick hand to the heart — the
spasmodic contraction of face — the
whitened lips — the sudden collapse into
the nearest seat — were easier passed off as
of " no moment," " an attack too slight and
common to claim attention, the result of a
weak heart," than if Smiles or his master
had been there to observe.

Yet even they might have set the spasm
down to the best of affectionate remembrance
called up by the unexpected presentment
of a likeness so palpable ; seeing
how subject to such attacks Mrs Norreys
had become of late.

The wreck was an established fact ; the
drowning a foregone conclusion ; never a

VOL. II. F

ship could have sailed into Sandwich
Haven that carried merchandise for
Martin Copeland ; and the little drowsy
seaport was a terra-incognita alike to
master and man. What had she to fear ?

Yet the very coming of the picture
showed that there were latent forces arrayed
against her ; and, though she
schooled herself to meet her brother and
hear the story of its purchase with no
more than natural excitement, her nerves
were all in a secret quiver. The distinguished
bravery of her son Cecil at the
Alma had been followed by congratulations
in shoals. Who would congratulate
her in disgrace ^ She was paying a long
penalty for her hasty deed.

Like a reprieve to the condemned was
the hearing that " no information about the
picture could be had until the artist returned
from the Crimea." Perhaps he
might never return ! Some stray bullet
miofht — at least time was obtained for thinking
and planning. If the girl and her
mother could only be removed to a dish



tance ! And that horrid clergyman — but
that might be managed.

She Httle imagined that, even as she
caught her breath, and thought, and
planned, the girl was with strangers away
from Sandwich, almost within the shadow
of Canterbury Cathedral, assisting to remove
the travelling wraps of her own old
friend, Miss Ainslie.

From her mother and Mrs Ashurst
Hetty " had received copious instructions
with regard to her new duties and deportment
in a large establishment, and Mrs
Bemerton's own maid had consented to
indoctrinate the novice in the mysteries
of her calling. She had not expected to
be placed on the familiar footing with the
family she served, as heretofore ; but as
little had she expected to be a mere wheel
among other wheels in a complex domestic
machine, required to work together without
friction, but having no more sympathy
with each other or with those they served
than had the sails of the mill with Mrs
Rye.

It checked the warm currents of her
heart, and made reserve again a necessity.
Only in the schoolroom with the youngsters
did she feel at ease.

There was very little sympathy between
the heads of the family, so how could it be
expected with domestics ? Changes were
frequent.

Mr Bemerton, much older than his fashionable
wife, was a man of learning, given
up to antiquarian research and literature.
The string of honourable capitals after his
name might be likened to the tail of a
comet. Men of cognate pursuits from half
the dry-adust societies in Europe found
their way to his library — a sort of archaeological
museum. Mrs Bemerton's sole
consolation was, that in entertaining these
celebrated strangers she had an excuse for
filling her drawing-room with more acceptable
society.

She had a marriageable daughter to
dispose of, and a second who would shortly
be in the same category. These two
young ladies, Miss Bemerton and Miss

Maud, claimed the especial services of
Fleming." There were three younger
girls in the nursery and schoolroom, and
after the daily governess had gone home,
and Florence and Maud were dressed for
the evening, she was expected to take her
sewing into the schoolroom and superintend
lessons and music practice.

There were sons of intermediate ages,
but as these were away at Harrow they
need not be specified.

In her engagement with Mrs Bemerton,
Euretta (she was " Fleming " henceforth)
had made an express stipulation that she
should be allowed an hour a day in her
own room, free from intrusion or inquiry',
and once a week two hours to eo
whithersoever she pleased. There had
been both surprise and demur at this, but
to obtain these privileges the girl expressed
her willingness to rise earlier than others,
to neglect no duty, and to accept a lower
monetary consideration than her predecessor.
The latter inducement had its full
weight. Mrs Pemberton thought the request

savoured of eccentricity, said it was
singular," shrugged her shoulders, and
consented. Euretta was undertakings double
duty for single pay, hence the concession.

Miss Bemerton and Miss Maud, both
fairly attractive young ladies, who followed
in the fashionable wake of mamma, made
merry over this whimsy of their new maid,
and thought by filling every moment of her
time to leave her no spare hour for herself.
She was ever willing to do little matters
out of her own province, but no sooner did
she comprehend their drift, than she began
to lay aside whatsoever work she was
engaged on when the clock struck, and to
retire.

If this caused them personal inconvenience,
they knew they had no ground for
complaint, and soon ceased to interfere
with the plans of their deft and obliging
handmaid ; though not without some exhibition
of curiosity.

Her fellow-servants were not one whit
less curious than their betters, and were at
first inclined to resent this concession ; but

she gave herself no airs, and though her
composure and reserve were Impenetrable,
they were not offensive. Then, thanks to
her early-rising habits, she could find time
to help lie-a-beds in a morning, and was
as ready to assist in the arrangement of a
table as to keep accounts for the housekeeper.
And she contrived to do it without
encouraging familiarity. As the butler
said, she was " like a lump of sugar ina
glass case ; no one got any nearer to
her."

Why she was so ready to render service
beyond her own province, was part of her
secret — for she had a secret.

She soon found the advantage of her
own reserve. It kept admiring men-servants
at a distance, prevented jealousy
among the maids in the kitchen, and made
her a favourite with Mrs Royle the housekeeper,
if not with Mrs Bemerton's own
maid, Pipkin. She never tolerated a
possible rival near her own throne.

Euretta had not been in her new situation
many hours before she was required

to assist Miss Bemerton and a lady visitor
in dressing for a concert ; nor half that
time before she heard the young ladies
dilating on the glorious deeds of a Captain
Ainslie, and regretting that he was no
longer at home to be of their party that
evening.

Captain Ainslie ! " How strangely
familiar seemed the name after that colloquy
in the stage-coach ! Could he be the
same individual spoken of ? " Paul," —
yes, that was the same name ; and the
lady she had to dress was Miss Ainslie,
the officer's aunt.

All this Euretta heard whilst she was
beings inducted into the secrets of drawers
and wardrobes, and whilst fastidious
Miss Bemerton fixed on the dress and
adornments she would wear,

How singular," ran her thoughts,
that I should hear so much of Captain
Ainslie in the coach, and come at once
among his friends. Perhaps I shall hear
something of that odious Captain Norreys
before long."

She did hear him mentioned casually
in the course of time, but not then.
The Norreys did not belong to Kent,
and there was no intimacy between the
families.

Of Paul Ainslie she soon heard sufficient
to show that Miss Bemerton was
desirous to appropriate him to herself, if
she had not already done so, and she early
found herself speculating whether the
young lady was worthy the noble and
distinguished hero.

She speedily discovered that Miss Ains-lie
was the tall, thin lady with the crisp
little curls, who had so politely made way
for herself and the little Ryes to pass
between the ancient walls of Richborough,
and found herself wondering if the captain
in the Crimea had as sweet a voice, and
was as handsome as his pleasant-looking
aunt must have been.

At all events, she found the maiden lady
much easier to please, less exacting, and
sooner satisfied than either of her young
mistresses, and she could not help wishing

that fortune had thrown her into Miss
Aisle's service instead.

She also found her quite as full of the
hero's gallant deeds, and as willing to discourse
of his bravery and generosity to
any listener, as they had been to each
other reg-artless of her insignificant
presence.

She could not fail to observe how gracious
Mrs Bemerton and her daughters were
to Miss Ainslie during the week of her
stay ; had she been their own relative,
with a fortune at her disposal, they could
scarcely have been more so.

You see, she had a distinguished nephew,
not yet disposed of, and he had a fortune
worth the winning.

Miss Ainslie and Mrs Bemerton had
been old school friends. The former,
therefore, was very much at home in the
house of the latter, and she made a point
of visiting the younger girls in the schoolroom
every evening after dinner.

She had thus frequent opportunities of
observing Euretta under other conditions

than as a "mistress of the robes;" she
saw that she was on the best of terms with
the young people, knew how to smooth
asperities in the path of knowledge, and to
win her gamesome charges to their studies
not tasks. She found too that she possessed
information outside the common
routine of school-books, and was familiar
with authors whose very names were beyond
the ordinary range of girls of seventeen.


On one occasion she surprised Euretta
at the schoolroom piano singing to the
girls the English version of Pai^tant Pour
la Syria, newly popularised by the war and
our alliance with France.

The schoolroom was almost at the top
of the house, and as Miss Ainslie paused
to take breath on the last flight of stairs,
sweet and clear as the note of a silver bell
rang out —

It was Dunois the young and brave,
Was bound to Palestine,
But first he made his orisons
Before St Mares shrine.

And grant, immortal Queen of Heaven,

Was still the soldier's prayer,
That I may prove the bravest knight,
And love the fairest fair.' "

She listened in surprise and delight until
the last line of the refrain was finished, before
she entered to discompose the singer.

Euretta rose and apologised.

I was merely singing to amuse the
children."

Don't apologise," said Miss Ainslie,
but sit down and finish the song ^o oblige
me. I sang it myself when I was as young
as you, and now that I have a brave young
knight in the East, it seems to have a fuller
significance. So, sit down, my dear, and
beoi'in acjain."

Oh, do, do ! " cried the little girls,
pressing round her.

Without more ado she resumed her seat
and began. Miss Ainslie's head kept time
with the music, but not until the last note
vibrated on the air did she make a remark.

Then she said, "Well, Miss Fleming"
(she had been merely " Fleming " hitherto),

"when I ascended those stairs I Httle anticipated
the treat in store for me. You have
a fresh, sweet voice, and it has been uncommonly
well cultivated. May I know
who has been your teacher ? "

The blind choir-master of our church
St Mary's, in Sandwich, I mean," she
added, correcting herself, " his name is
William Ashurst."

"Ashurst! Ashurst!" repeated Miss
Ainslie, " do you know what part of Kent
he belongs to ? "

I never heard."

•' Was he always blind ? "

No, he was blinded by a lightning-flash
that set his farm on fire, when he was a
young man."

Miss Ainslie seemed strangely moved,
I think I must have known him," said
she, rising to go, and forgetting to say
good night."

The following day she left for Ainslie
Holt. Before she went she offered to
Euretta a handsome gratuity, as had been
her wont with others.

Euretta appeared at once surprised and
hurt. "Thank you, Miss Aisle, but I
cannot accept it. Mrs Bemerton pays me
for my time and services."

Miss Aisle looked fixedly at the flushed
and beautiful face before her. " I find I
made a mistake," said she. " I am sorry.
I shall be more careful on future occasions."


Good-byes " were said, and she went to
her waiting carriage, followed by Euretta
with shawls and wraps, wondering if Mrs
Bemerton knew or appreciated the superior
young person engaged in her service. And
somehow the erect and slender lady, whose
gentle face was quaintly set in stiff, prim,
silvering round curls, under the full border
of her bonnet-cap, in thinking of " Miss
Fleming " thought also of Will Ashurst,
not as a poor basket-maker, but as a prosperous
young farmer, tall and handsome asher
own brother had been ; and she sighed
as she thought. Memory had brought
back the days of her own youth, and a
vision of the squire her father, erect, proud,

stern, and decisive, setting his foot on two
loves and lives.

Before another week had sped all England
was ringing with the news of the battle
of Balaclava, and its terrific pendant the
Charge of the Light Brigade, and if the
pulses of ordinary men and women quickened
as they read the first hurried telegrams,
what must have been the dread
excitement of those who waited to learn if
their dear ones were amongst the victorious
few, or the glorious many left with
their steeds on the trampled soil of the
fatal valley ; since immortalised as the
Valley of Death."

Barely could the report have reached
Ainslie Holt before Miss Ainslie's carriage
was tearing along the road to Canterbury,
and when it stopped at the Bemertons'
door, the horses were all in a froth.

There was a dinner-party on the tapis,
and her arrival had evidently discomposed
her friend, though the Bemertons were
genuinely interested in the fate of the gallant
hussar. But there was no disguising the

fact that it was a relief to both Florence
and her mamma when Miss Ainslie said
she was not in a frame of mind to meet
strangers, and would dine with the children
in the school-room. She had " merely-come
into Canterbury for the earliest intelligence
from the seat of war " — and her
lips were very white as she said it.

There was no music in the schoolroom
that evening. The three girls, more impressionable
than their elders, were awed
by the nervous restlessness of Miss
Ainslie's manner, and her pale anxious
face, all so different from her ordinary
pleasant smiles and calm demeanour. And
they listened eagerly to her loving reminiscences
of the nephew, who had grown
from boyhood to manhood, as it were, in
her charge — the nephew whose fate was
so uncertain, and of whom her heart was
so full.

Miss Ainslie had, part of the time, another
auditor whose interest and sympathy
were of another order, and insensibly the
speaker found herself addressing " Miss

Fleming," towards whom her very heart
seemed drawn.

Not that Euretta said much. At times
her eyes were fixed dreamily upon the fire,
but Miss Ainslie saw that she lost no word
of her discourse ; and that she could appreciate
the chivalry of the boy, Paul, as surely
as the heroism of Captain Ainslie.

Indeed so much had Euretta heard of
Captain Ainslie of late, as a partner in a
dance, or a partner for life, as well as a
soldier, that when the news came a few
days later that he had escaped with a slight
wound, she shared the general relief, and
offered her modest congratulations to his
friendly relative quite as if she had personally
known him and his worth. It was
then, too, that she heard again of Captain
Norreys, and, again, in a way to bring
the gallantry of Paul Ainslie only the more
prominently forward.

It appeared that he had received his
wound in riding to the succour of Captain
Norreys, of his own regiment, who had
been desperately wounded in the attempted

VOL. II. G

capture of a Russian gun. He had rescued
his brother-officer, and silenced the gun,
but he carried the head of a Cossack lance
away in his thigh as a memorial. A brief
line from himself conveyed the assurance
that he was in "no danger."

That night, " Dunois the young and
brave " was again sung in the schoolroom,
and the antiquary was added to the auditory,
Mrs Bemerton and her elder
daughters " having an engagement they
could not possibly break," an engagement
in which he was not included. Miss Ainslie,
whose visit had been unexpected and uninvited,
could not reasonably object ; but she
could think that the narrow escape of Paul
had not affected Miss Florence very deeply.
Never again could the young lady regain
the hold on the elder lady's heart, which
had been hers until then. " Shallow and
frivolous," was the tender-hearted aunt's
verdict ; " quite unworthy of my noble
Paul." And she was right.

Back to the Holt she went the next
morning with her own load of anxiety

considerably lightened, in spite of the
heavy drizzle and mist which ushered in
November. And as she left the house,
she found herself contrasting Miss Florence
with her maid Fleming, much to the
disadvantage of the former.

When tidings came of the frightful hurricane
which had swept the Black Sea and
the Crimea on the 13th, breaking up our
ships like soap-bubbles, giving our seamen
and stores to the deep, hurling and whirling
tents and tables, clothing and bedding
through the air like snow-flakes in a storm,
leaving sick and wounded officers and
men exposed to wet and cold, fireless and
foodless, in a muddy slough — the suffering
of our army was the theme of every
tongue.

Euretta heard with ting-lino ears and
wondered how Miss Ainslie could bear
it, seeing how sad and wretched it made
her only to think of it ; wondered if
Captain Ainslie's wound had begun to
heal before the storm, and if Captain
Norreys had survived it.

Meanwhile Miss Ainslie, who had no
spirit to entertain friends at the Holt
whilst its dearly-loved master was exposed
to the pitiless winter with his wound unhealed,
paced the deserted rooms in restless
anxiety, or drove into Canterbury and
back, wishing she could transfer to the
Holt the fair maid whose sympathies were
finer than those of her employers.

Coming and going, if only for a " call,"
Miss Ainslie's perceptions were alive to
the fact that Mrs Bemerton was as usual
growing dissatisfied with her new maid, and
that she was herself in part accountable.

The fact was that the notice she and
others had taken of the new dependant had
excited the envy and jealousy of the rest.

In the servants' hall Fleminof was stir
raised as artful and deceitful ; the mystery
of her daily hour alone, and of her weekly
walks abroad, were freely canvassed, and
spies were on the watch.

Pipkin, Mrs Bemerton's own maid, led
the clique, andshe had the earof sempstress.

It reached a climax at Christmas.

TWO CONCERT TICKETS.

AR, pestilence, and famine may
stalk abroad, but no stop must
be put on public entertainment.
Nay, suffering and disaster often
furnish an excuse for a fete — for charity.

The untellable, unimaginable wretchedness
and privations of our soldiers in the
Crimea, compelled to winter on its inhospitable
shores, with no adequate provision
against its inclemency after the
November hurricane had made havoc of
their stores by land and by sea, roused at
once public indignation and compassion.
Cholera and dysentery began their deci-

matins work before a blow of battle had
been struck ; then when food, forage,
physic, clothing, covering, all went to the
bottom of the Black Sea — when rascally
contractors sent out bogus supplies, and
our men were perishing for want of necessaries,
popular indignation found vent in
relief subscriptions ; a sweet Derbyshire
Nightingale flew on the wings of an angel
to mitigate the horrors of the hospital
at Scutari, and her sisters at home were
busy helpers, scraping linen for lint, tearing
up letters for stuffing pillows, knitting
warm gloves and comforters, selecting
and collecting books to be sent out, and
everywhere performances were given to
raise funds.

Canterbury had its sacred concert. It
was patronised by the clergy and the elite
of the gentry around. The organist of the
cathedral was at once manasseh and conductor.
Musicians and vocalists alike
gave their services. And the programme
included, besides selections from " The
Messiah " and other oratorios, two violin

solos by a blind musician, a Mr William
Ashurst.

This happened to be the only name on
the programme of which nothing was
known. Questions were asked, and soon
it was buzzed abroad that Mr Ashurst was
a rara-avis the organist was proud to
have discovered and brought to light. Expectation
was on the qui vive.

For a wonder expectation was not disappointed.
The spirits of melody and
harmony lay sleeping and imprisoned in
his old violin to waken at the blind
musician's touch. His bow swept over
the strings as if his very soul were in his
finger-tips, and thrilled to set the captive
Aries free. As brilliant, rapid, full-toned
passages died away, in cadences so low
and delicate that the listening ear could
barely catch the thin thread of sound, there
fell a breathless hush upon the auditory,
which broke at the close into enthusiastic
applause.

Will Ashurst had achieved a signal
triumph before a critical audience.

Only follow this up, Mr Ashurst," said
the organist to him when the concert was
over, and congratulations had poured upon
him, "only follow it up, and your fortune is
made. Why, I saw tears, absolutely tears,
on the cheeks of Miss Ainslie — one of the
Bemerton party."

"Miss whats asked the other, with a
sharp catch of his breath.

Miss Ainslie, of Ainslie Holt. You
may not know her, but she is a great patroness
of our social talent. She has a
finely-appreciative ear, and such a tribute
from her is worth a whole round of applause."


It is all very gratifying ; and it may be
as you say, sir," said Will Ashurst, after a
momentary contraction of his countenance,
but I miss the * well done ' of the sweet
little maid, who has led my steps to the
footstool of that same fortune."

Little maid ! Do you call Miss Fleming
little '^ " began the organist. " I call
her—"

At that moment a tall lady, with a white

and grey opera-hood over her head, detached
herself from her party (waiting
with others of the dispersing audience for
carriages), and, advancing towards the pair,
laid her hand lightly on the arm of sightless
Will, who started at the touch.

Mr Ashurst," she said, in a softly-modulated
voice, which yet held a tremor
for his acute ear, " will you shake hands
with me, and accept my congratulations.
Many years have gone by since we met,
but your bow has not lost its cunning.
You have achieved an undoubted success.
For my own part, I am proud to find your
great talent devoted to so noble a purpose,
and in the name of my nephew and his
fellow-soldiers in the Crimea, I thank you
most sincerely."

He had taken the proffered hand, and
held it for a moment. •

It is, indeed, long since we met, and
might have been longer, but for a young
girl I had hoped to meet to-night. What
music I had taught her caused my introduction
here."

May I ask how ? "

Well, it is rather a long story. She
lived under my humble roof with her
mother for many years, and having no
children of our own, my wife and I took
kindly to the winning little thing. She became
as much my companion as my fiddle,
and by means of a game I invented for her,
picked up the theory of music long before
she had regular lessons on an instrument.
Coming to live in Canterbury, she went to
Mr Spencer here to improve her execution
on the pianoforte. He was pleased to say
something in praise of her early training.
That introduced my name. He came over
to Sandwich to see me, and — here I am —
so you see — I do owe my appearance and
reception here ; and my accidental meeting
with you, Miss Ainslie, after all these years
of change, to the girl who is not here to
shake hands with her friends ; for I did not
come hither alone."

Miss Ainslie, who had observed a short,
fussy individual assiduously offering a silver
snuff-box to a tall, thin clerical gentleman,

and to the organist, all apparently
waiting, then said, —

Is her name Fleming ? "

His face brightened.

Ah, to be sure, you will know Hetty.
She lives with your friends. Perhaps you
can tell me why she has disappointed us
to-night ? "

Yes, I know her, and she interests me
greatly. There has been some little unpleasantness
at Mrs Bemerton's to-day ;
and in consequence Fleming could not obtain
permission. She may see you in the
morning, if you do not leave Canterbury
to-night. When I return to the Holt, I
think she will go with me. She is leaving
Mrs Bemerton. I perceive my friends
grow impatient. Good-night, Mr Ashurst."

And so the two, who had been lovers in
their youth, whom adverse fate, in the
guise of a determined sire, proud of his
birth and social status, had sundered for
more than a quarter of a century, met and
parted with a hand clasp. They had outlived
the sorrow of their separation. Hein

his blindness and poverty, had found a
mate and consolation. She, in her wealth,
was still — unwedded and alone.

Her hand was small and soft, her voice
was fresh and sweet — she was unchanged
to hint. But she had eyes to see how time,
misfortune, toil, and his supreme affliction
had changed the man she had known, and
for whose sake she was still Miss Ainslie.

"A little unpleasantness," she had said.
It was something more than that.

She had been present when Euretta,
with some diffidence, had approached Mrs
Bemerton, and solicited permission for herself
and Mrs Royle to use two concert
tickets which had been sent to her.

Mrs Bemerton threw herself back in
her chair, and stared at the petitioner, as if
struck dumb with surprise.

I should not have presumed to ask,"
said the girl, with heightened colour and a
little nervous folding of her hands, " if Mr
Ashurst had not been one of my very
earliest friends ; the one to whom I owe

nearly all I know of music. He will
bring me news of my mother and other
friends in Sandwich."

Did Mr Ashurst send you the tickets ? "
put Mrs Bemerton, with severe scrutiny.

No, madam."

Then who else presumed to send
tickets to my servant for a concert which
I was known to patronise."

The lady's loftiness was superb.

Euretta was silent.

I presume they came from that other
friend of yours, the organist, whom you
visit so stealthily every week ! " cried Mrs
Bemerton, hurling the accusation at the
young woman as if it were overwhelming.

Euretta's nervousness was gone, and her
colour with it.

I visit no one by stealth, madam.
When I came to Canterbury, I brought
a letter of introduction from our good
vicar to Mr Spencer. I am having music-lessons
from him."

Mrs Bemerton's scorn was intense. She
eyed the girl from head to foot.

What can a lady's-maid want with high-class
music-lessons ?"

Again the colour rose to Euretta's very-brow,
but in her answer she was cool, and
calm, and presuming.

I have so far found them useful in the
school-room. And I am endeavouring to
qualify for something higher than a lady's-maid.


For a lady, may be ! " and Mrs Pemberton's
lip curled. Then she demanded, with
sudden asperity, " For what are you qualifying
when you waste an hour a-day playing
' baby-house ' with toys ? "

Euretta started ; the pupils of her large
dark eyes dilated, and her finely-sensitive
nostrils quivered as the humane lady-patroness
of the coming concert turned to
Miss Ainslie, and with a short, derisive
laugh, said, —

What think you, my dear ? This
young person, who has concert-tickets sent
to her from the conductor, and who may
possibly be ' qualifying' for di prima-donna,
stipulated with me for an hour a day in

the privacy of her own room, and for what ?
For study or devotion ? Oh, no ! Only
that she may spread her table with a toy
tea-service or dinner-service as the case
may be, and hold a Barmecide feast with
imaginary guests ! It is all so ridiculous,
that one can but laugh ; still it is not pleasant
to have made a foolish concession to a
dependant for so absurd a purpose."

Miss Ainslie, who had once or twice
been on the point of retiring, and who had
only testified her uneasiness at the tenor
of this colloquy by the more energetic dart
of her crochet-hook through the red woollen
loops of the soldier's comforter she was
working, looked up with her serene eyes,
and said, placably, —

I think, Matilda, there could be no harm
in Fleming going with Mrs Royle to hear
her old friend ; and I daresay she can explain
all that you think absurd."

Mrs Bemerton's snappy " Go ? certainly
not ! " had a sudden check.

Euretta was speaking. Her voice was
as clear and firm as when she had a wilful

child to control. " I decline to enter into
explanations with a mistress who descends
to espionage, or to serve one who does not
respect her own contract. You will have
the goodness, madam, to provide the
young ladies with another maid."

Without another word she left the room,
mistress of the situation, but all in a quiver
with the suppression of her own supreme
contempt and disgust.

Someone must have been watching my
movements both indoors and out," she said
to herself. " Either Mrs Bemerton has
employed spies, or she has encouraged
them, and either is dishonourable. I would
not stay in the place another day if I did
not fear I should disturb my mother. I
could go to the Ashurst for a time, I
know, and I might ask Miss Ainslie to recommend
me to a new situation. There is
no one here I need regret but the children."

She made the request to Miss Ainslie
whilst dressing her hair for the concert.
There had already been a little " difference
of opinion" between that lady and Mrs

vD

Bemerton respecting the maid who spent
her leisure in " child's play," and the
maid who stealthily looked on through
the chink of a door, and carried tales to
her mistress.

Mrs Bemerton had decided on the summary
dismissal of Fleming on the morrow
when the concert was over ; and Miss
Ainslie, who had taken a liking to the girl,
who somehow reminded her of someone
she had known," had begun to consider
how far she would be justified in countenancing
one whom her friend discarded,
when Euretta solicited her recommendation.


It gave her an excuse for asking how
much of Mrs Bemerton's statement Alas
correct.

All," answered Euretta steadily. " All
that was seen, nothing that was guessed.
What might seem child's play was serious
study. Believe me. Miss Ainslie, my
motives were not frivolous, though I could
not condescend to enter into an explanation
with Mrs Bemerton. I partly engaged

VOL. II. H

with her in order to observe how a large
establishment was conducted, how visitors
were received, and how a lady presided at
her own table. In my private hours I
practised what I made occasions to observe.
I had done so long before I left the Ryes.
Some day I expect to occupy such a position
as will need a higher training than I
have had."

Indeed ! How is that ? "

Euretta hesitated.

Pardon me, I do not feel at liberty to
say more. I should not have said so
much had you not been so very kind and
affable."

Miss Ainslie smiled, but did not press
the question ; she put another.

Would you like to be a lady's companion
and secretary ? I think you are
equal to the duties, and if so, I may be
able to assist you."

With Euretta's well-pleased affirmative,
the subject dropped for the time being.

Miss Ainslie, however, did not lose
sight of it. Her advocacy of Euretta's

cause that morning had already produced
a coolness between herself and Mrs Pemberton,
hence her sudden intention to return
home on the morrow. It had previously
occurred to her that the youth and beauty
of Miss Fleminof might serve to brighten
up the Holt, which had grown so dreary
to its mistress, now that its master was in
danger. She did not care altogether to
provoke a rupture with her old schoolfellow.
Yet so much of Matilda Pemberton's
caprice had she seen at one time or
other, she felt half inclined to risk it — and
teach her a lesson. Hence her remark to
Will Ashurst.

Her decision was speedily precipitated,
a decision on which hung; more than she
could have foreseen.

Clouds lowered on Mrs Bemerton's brow
when she took her seat behind the urn at
the breakfast-table the morning after the
concert. A blazing fire in the wide grate
had multiple reflections in silver and glass,
and Derby china, but its cheery rays went
no farther. The antiquary was sarcastic,

Mrs Bemerton lofty and irate. It was
very soon apparent that the ill-assorted
pair were disagreeing about Fleming.

Miss Ainslie," said he, over his coffee,
can you tell me where there is a manufactory
for perfect people, such as ladies'-maids,
governesses, and so forth. I thought
we had found something very near the
perfect article, one who could trim a topknot,
or a frock, give a lesson in music or
good manners, and keep the nursery in
order without bluster or bad English."

I thought so too," she answered,
smiling ; " it appears we were mistaken."

Mrs Bemerton was warmer than her
breakfast. Their words provoked a sneering
retort.

"If you think Fleming such a paragon,
you had better try her yourself. Miss
Ainslie. Her ways may suit you, they
do not suit nic ; and she quits this roof
before the day is out."

In that case," said Miss Ainslie quietly,
I think I will take your advice. I amin
want of a lady-like and well-educated

companion, and I fancy she will just suit

me."

Mrs Bemerton had not expected this.
She put down her cup and opened wide her
eyes.

Bravo ! " cried the antiquary, clapping
his hands.

Papa !" remonstrated Miss Bemerton,
in a tone which said she was shocked at
his ill-breeding; but "papa" was too well
pleased to heed.

A companion ! " echoed his wife, with
haughty amazement, and she shut her lips
close to keep her wrath from boiling over.

Mrs Bemerton had already issued her fiat
against Fleming, she had been told to pack
her trunk and her dolls' china, and depart
at once, with coin in lieu of legal notice,
the lady's temper having risen under her
spouse's sarcasms to a heat which overcame
her economics.

Miss Ainslie's startling adoption of her
own proposal was signal defeat. Her suspicions
and airs had incommoded no one
so much as herself She had, moreover,

a vague impression that she had damaged
the interests of her daughter Florence.
This sudden adoption of their discarded
maid spoke volumes. Florence was certain
to reproach her with want of tact when
they were gone.

Miss Ainslie soon made her arrangements
with Euretta, packing was done,
her carriage ordered, and the children, who
clung around the latter, were promised
they should come and visit her ere long at
the Holt. Mrs Bemerton in high displeasure
held aloof from leave-takings in the
morning-room, but Mr Bemerton followed
them to the carriage, and shook
hands with Fleming as well as with
her new mistress before the door was
closed upon them.

To the ' Fleur-de-lys,' " said Miss
Ainslie, and Euretta, who sat for the
first time inside a private carriage, had
scarcely overcome her strangeness, not
to say awkwardness, when the vehicle
stopped, and to her surprise she saw
on the hotel steps, not only her blind

friend, but Dr Manningham, and the Rev.
Austin Uofhtred.

There were hand-shaking, greetings,
introductions, explanations. The three
men had been on the point of starting
for the Bemertons to make inquiries about
Our Hetty," and if necessary to carry
her home with them ; both the vicar and
the basket-maker offering her a home in
any future emergency.

You are ah very, very kind to me,"
said Euretta, with much feeling, " and I
cannot thank you sufficiently. I should
indeed have needed a home for a time, if
Miss Ainslie had not helped me out of my
difficulty, when so abruptly dismissed this
morning. My mind flew at once to Mrs
Ashurst, I had not the presumption to
think of the vicarage."

You need not call it presumption,
Etta. Your mother and I — " and there
he stopped abruptly, adding after a pause,
could make room for you." But that
was not what he had meant to say, for he
seemed slightly confused.

How is my mother ? " asked Euretta.

Dr Manninc^ham thrust himself forward.

Quite well, Miss Hetty, never better.
The air of the vicarage seems to asfree
with her. In fact, either that or her good
fortune seems to have made a new woman
of her. In fact, if she were to throw away
her stick and walk without it I should not
be surprised."

Good fortune ! " Euretta looked to the
vicar for an explanation.

Only another mysterious note," said
he, in lowered tones, adding " she charged
me to deliver this to you, she has so few
uses for the money, and your salary has
been too small to dress you properly,"
and he slipped a bank-note into the girl's
hand, to her surprise.

She took it with thanks. The sum
paid so grudgingly by Mrs Bemerton
would, she was conscious, scarcely suffice
to equip her for her new post, however
quietly she might dress.

Pray, Mr Ughtred," were her last
words to him, " thank my mother, and

tell her that the continuation of this secret
supply only strengthens my conviction
that by some ways unknown as yet she
will be reconciled to my grandfather, and
obtain her rights in the end. It is a
dream of mine that will surely come true."

Ah ! that was her day-dream. But
what of that other dream of which no
whisper was ever heard } Did she think
of that as she sat in front of the amiable
lady, to whom she was now companion,
the lady who seemed like herself lost in
reverie as the carriage bowled along the
frosty - road, with sparks flying from the
horses' hoofs }

Had she ever dreamed of that drive
through those lodge-gates, or that chestnut
avenue, sparkling and glittering with
rime on every branch and spray ? Had
she ever dreamed of that honos turreted
stone mansion, with its mullions windows
and its embattled roof, with pendant icicles
from coign and gargoyle ? Had she ever
dreamed of that wide entrance-hall, hung
with trophies of war and the chase ? Or

of her introduction to that white-haired
housekeeper in black silk, who curtsied
so respectfully when she was told, —

This is a young friend of Mr William
Ashurst's, who has come to live with me.
You had better put her in the west turret
room ? "

No, she had never dreamed of this.
And yet she felt as if she were in a dream
at such reception. It was not that of a
humble dependant.

She knew not how the friendship of
vicar, and doctor, but most of all Will
Ashurst, the poor blind basket-maker, had
elevated her.

EURETTAS DREAM.

^U Rest A found life at Ainslie
Holt very different from existence
at the Bemertons. There
her mistresses had been many,
her duties multifarious, her position in the
household ill defined. She had many times
regretted the homelier familiarity of those
she served at the Black Mill.

At Ainslie Holt she came at once into
a fresh atmosphere, and was raised to a
higher level. Miss Ainslie invariably
treated her with respect, and addressed
her as Miss Fleming, and whatever footman
and coachman might have to say of

her in the servants' hall, relative to her
former position at the Bemertons, they
were respectful too. The mistress gave
the tone to the household.

An old and valued companion of Miss
Ainslie's had died the year before, and
never been replaced ; and some peculiar
instinct or affinity had influenced her selection
of Euretta to fill the vacant post. She
had desired to engfao-e her lonQ- before the
rupture at the Bemertons. If it was an
experiment, it proved a most successful
one. There was nothing of the uplifted
maid about the new companion.

All her life Euretta had been indoctrinated
with the belief that she was held
down beneath her own proper station, and
that she must look up. Association with
her mother had preserved her from vulgarity,
and rising by gradations as she had
done, suggested no undue cause for elation.
She had all aloof been grateful to Miss
Ainslie for courteous friendliness, so
strongly in contrast with the manner of
the Bemerton ladies, but though gratitude

swelled her heart, and set feet and hands
in motion to serve, it was not openly-demonstrative.


At the Holt, she soon learned to love
the calm and kindly maiden lady, who set
her at ease with herself, and made her
duties so light and pleasurable ; who took
her private hours alone for granted, rather
than as an out-of-the-way concession.

Her octagonal room in the turret adjoined
Miss Ainslie's, and though furnished
like the rest of the mansion in a bygone
style, it was furnished fully, with no meagre
suggestiveness of provision for an inferior
occupant. Nay, in the completeness of its
fittings and arrangement, Euretta saw only
fresh cause for gratitude and esteem of the
kindly lady who provided even a case of
books for the use of a dependant. She
had made a change indeed. She had only
to intimate a desire to adapt and amplify
her wardrobe, and straightway she was
charged also with a number of commissions
for Miss Ainslie, and the phaeton placed at
her disposal for a journey to Canterbury.

The lady could be gracious without becoming
familiar.

Busiest of the busy in her zeal for the
relief of our suffering soldiers was the mistress
of the Holt in those days, and many
were the visitors who came for conference,
or with contributions for her collection of
stores, but whatever their rank, one and all
went away impressed with the rare beauty
of Miss Fleming, and puzzled to decide
whether she was Miss Ainslie's friend or
only her companion."

She became both ere long. Miss Ainslie
had not expected to find in her so tireless
a coadjutor. Knitting-pins, crochet-hook,
needle, all were in her hands by turns, and
plied with the dexterity of an adept. Comforters,
muffatees, gloves, socks, shirts —
nothing came amiss to her. She pitied the
sick and suffering men, and worked away
with all her heart and soul speeding her
finders. Had a lover or a brother been
among the wounded, she could not have
been more zealous or energetic. Not until
the cases of stores were packed and despatched,

and correspondence with the main
committee in London came to an end for
the time beinor, did she allow herself breathing
space.

This was not the routine work of an
ordinary companion, and the spirit in which
it was undertaken seemed to narrow the
distance between the twain. Then under
this excitement, and the genial influence of
her new mistress, her own natural reserve
gradually wore away. All she saw of Miss
Ainslie but deepened her esteem and affection.
Quiet and create though the maiden

*-^ c > O

lady was, she had all the force of character
which Euretta's mother lacked, and she,
who inherited much of the sea captain's
self-reliance, could not fail to appreciate
and venerate. And though unspoken,
Miss Ainslie could not fail to see how
lovingly her wishes and desires were met
or anticipated. They were thrown together,
as it were, for mutual satisfaction
and happiness.

No private letters reached the Holt
from its distant master, and as day by day

she read aloud the distressing news from
the seat of war, she seemed to partake the
feverish excitement of Miss AinsHe, though,
as she often told herself, Paul Ainslie could
be to her no more than any other of the
Queen's warlike lieges. And somehow she
needed the self-reminder rather frequently.

But no wonder she shared the anxiety
of the gracious lady for her nephew, when
she herself heard his name and his praises
on all tongues, from the village urchin to
the portly rector, from the gardener's
youngest assistant to the stately housekeeper,
and not a cowboy on the estate
but would touch his cap to her, and ask ina
respectful undertone if there was any
news of the good master.

She often found herself wondering what
this captain of hussars was like, who had
won his way into so many hearts, for
though pictures of Paul from babyhood to
boyhood hung upon the walls, there was
no likeness of the man. The Sandhurst
cadet had there his coloured presentment,
but only as a youth of eighteen ;

he must have changed in the course often
years.

Still she found herself wondering, and
strangely enough the boyish face seemed
to perplex her, as it confused and mingled
with an older image in her mind ; the
image of a bronzed and bearded man, who
somehow had the same eyes.

The frost and snow had long disappeared,
the drooping snowdrops and the bolder
crocuses had vanished too ; there was a
fragrant scent of daffodils on the breeze,
and the wood or holt which surrounded the
mansion on three sides, and gave the place
its name, seemed like a mist of dusky pink,
with here and there a patch of tender green,
waving above a sylvan carpet of young
anemones and primroses, ground ivy and
moss. There was a twittering of birds
among the budding branches, and the first
cuckoo had been heard, but still no letter
came to Miss Ainsliefrom the captain, and
expectation sank into something akin to
dread.

Miss Ainslie sent a line of anxious in-vol.

II. I

query to the War Office, and whilst red-tape
and circumlocution kept her waiting,
Euretta received a missive of importance
which she did not expect. It was dated
from St Mary's Vicarage, Sandwich, and
ran thus : —

** My Dear Euretta, — It has been
quite a pleasure to me and to Mr Ughtred
to hear how delightfully you are situated,
and how happy you are with Miss Ainslie.
And we feel it is almost a shame to suggest
a change to you that is not the change
you have dreamed about so long.

I am no nearer reconciliation to my
estranged father than when you left us ;
though another mysterious bank-note came
to me this week, and they can only come
from him. Your dreams, so far, have
not come true. But something has happened
of which you cannot have dreamed.

*' A very much better living has been
offered to Mr Ughtred, in Sussex, and still
near the coast. He has decided on accepting
it. But he would not make that

decision until / had consented to accept
Jim. He said he should have made me
the offer long before if he had seen any-chance
of preferment ; that I had filled the
void in his home and heart left when his
dear mother died, I am sure, Euretta,
you will not blame me for accepting him.
You know what a noble, true, unselfish
man he is ; how pure and true a Christian,
but you cannot know, my dear, the spoiled,
selfish, unreasoning creature I was before
I was cast helpless on his compassionate
care ; or all the change wrought in me by
his teaching and example, and that of our
blind friend, Mr Ashurst.

We are to be married here next month
by the incoming vicar, and hope you will
be present. Indeed, it is the desire both
of Mr Ughtred and myself that you should
resign your situation, and live with us at
the rectory. I need not tell you how good
a father he will be to you, after all the experience
of his watchful care you have had.

It will please you to learn that there
is a new organ at St Mildred's, and Mr

Ashurst roes with us as oro-anist. He has
refused several engagements as a violinist
at London concerts, because they would
either take him away from his good old
wife, or drag her about into society for
which she is unfitted. He says she married
him in his poverty and helplessness,
when he had neither home nor friends, and
has helped him to make both ; he would
rather break his fiddle than neglect her,
either for the pleasure of others or the
profit he might make.

The rector of St Peter's has allowed
him the use of the organ for practice, and
Mr Spencer has been helping to freshen
up his long-neglected talent. I hear that
he played an organ in Canterbury when he
was young, riding into the city from his
farm for the purpose.

We shall miss Dr Manningham and
his snuff-box at St Mildred's, but we cannot
have all our friends with us, I hope,
my dear daughter, we shall at least have
you. Mr Ughtred joins me in thanking
Miss Ainslie for all her kindness, and

trusts she will not object to part with you
under the present circumstances, to share
the future home and happiness of — Your
affectionate mother,

Margaret Fleming."

Miss Aisle noted the varying emotions
flitting like Hosts and shadows over Eu-recta's
expressive face as she read and
re-read the missive so full of exceptional
interest for her; the shadows coming on
at the close.

I hope you have no ill news there ? "
said Miss Ainslie at length.

Well," replied Euretta, with a curious
smile, " I suppose I ought to rejoice, for
my mother's sake, her troubles have led
only to peace and serenity. She needed a
strong arm to lean on, and she has found
it. I am doubtful only as it affects myself.
But, you had better read the letter, and
judge.

The rays of the morning sun fell
through the broad mullions window on
the silvery curls and lappets, and the tall

thin figure of the maiden lady, as, seated
in the heh-backed oaken chair, cushioned
for modern use, she took the letter from her
companion's hand, and scanned it carefully.

Until she had read every word she
made no comment. The letter contained
news for her of which Euretta had no
consciousness. All that related to Will
Ashurst touched memories sealed from the
ken of those among whom she lived and
moved.

At length she said, " You approve this

marriage

?"

Undoubtedly. It will restore my
mother to her true position, and bless her
life with the love and support of as good a
man as walks the earth, I care not where
the other may be," answered Euretta
proudly, as she stood before the questioner,
with the light full on the rolls of
dark-brown hair, which set off, like a coronal,
her oval, well-formed face, on the
crochet collar above the full bodice of her
dark cashmere dress, and the pink silk bow
at her throat.

But about yourself ? Your mother
desires to have you with her. It is only
natural. What have you to say ? " And
Miss Ainslie paused for a reply ; with no
intimation of her own desires or regrets.

"Would you like me to leave you, Miss
Ainslie?" questioned Euretta in turn.

Certainly not, my dear. You have
brightened up the Holt wonderfully. I
should be very lonely indeed now were you
to go away. I should miss your youthful
face, your song, your footfall, your look
and touch of sympathy in my sadness."

The reply was prompt.

There needs no other answer. My
mother will have her husband ; she will
not miss me. I should not feel at home
with them as I do here with you, in this
fine old place. You have been so much
more of a kind friend to me than a mistress,
that for the first time in my life I
have realised all my mother lost, when she
quitted her father's home ; and what our
position should have been, ay, and will be
yet if dreams come true." And Euretta's

eyes looked through the glass at something
that was neither grassy lawn nor
gravelled drive, nor the long vista of tall
trees just wakening into life.

Miss Ainslie looked up, pleased and
puzzled.

My dear, you are speaking in enigmas,
and not for the first time. This letter only
adds to the perplexity. I am well aware
that love overlooks disparity of rank or
position" — a faint flush tinged the speaker's
brow, beneath the crisp white curls. Had
not she overlooked it ? " But the Rev.
Austin Ughtred is of ancient race and
lineage. Can it be that Mrs Bemerton
was mistaken in saying that your mother
was a seamstress, when she offered you a
situation about three years ago ? And
what is all this about dreaming ? "

It was Euretta's turn to flush. She sat
down within the shade of the crimson-velvet
curtain. But she answered steadily, —

She was " not mistaken. My mother
was then a seamstress ; but she was also
the widow of a brave sea-captain, and the

daughter of a very rich merchant in London,
who cast her off because she went to
sea with her husband instead of staying
on land with him. When his ship was
wrecked, and we only were saved, mother
and Mr Ughtred both wrote to my grandfather,
but he was still unforgiving. Mr
Ughtred made another attempt to move
him before I went to teach the little Ryes,
but to no purpose. Stay, I must not say
that, for since then bank-notes have come
to my mother in blank covers every few
months ; and I think he must be relenting.
Indeed, it is a dream of nine that some
day grandfather will call her back to him,
and own us both."

Miss Ainslie noted that Euretta did not
name her grandfather, and delicately forbore
to inquire. She did not know that
the omission was more accidental than
premeditated.

So then Mr Ughtred only restores your
mother to a position she had lost ? " she
said ; and Euretta having bowed assent, she
added, after a pause, "and about yourself*"

"Well, Miss Ainslie, with your permission
I will go to Sandwich for my
mother's marriage ; but I will come back
and stay with you until you are tired of
me, or my own dream comes true."

Your own dream ? About your grandfather
do you mean ? "

No, Miss Ainslie, that is more of a
conviction than a dream, and yet it arises
out of a dream I had whilst I lived at the
Black Mill. I hope you will not laugh
at me, because I believe the dream will
come true, for I have dreamed the same
many times since then, and with never a
variation."

A smile flickered on Miss Ainslie's lips,
though she answered with sufficient gravity,
No ; I will not laugh, I have heard so
much indirectly of your dreams and dreaming,
I should really like to know what it
all means."

** Well," answered Euretta, with her eyes
still fixed on the unseen distance, and in
the tone of one who tells a well-conned
tale, " when I was living at the Black Mill, I

dreamed I was going to be married, and was
driven to church in my own grandfather's
carriage, from a large house with trees
before it that was his. We drove a long distance
through wide thorough fares of handsome
houses, with gardens in front, and
through streets of shops — so large, I never
saw the like — to a church with a wide, long
flight of steps and a high-pillared portico,
like a Grecian temple. And before we got
there I saw the steeple rising at the side,
something like a pyramid, crowned with a
Roman or Grecian statue. The pyramid
itself rose from a tower, with little pillars
around it. And it was at the side of the
church, not the end, which I thought curious.
Then I thought I was dressed in
white satin, even to my shoes ; and, instead
of a bonnet, wore a white lace veil,
and a wreath of pure white flowers, and
that I had upon my arms and neck resplendent
jewels of pearls and diamonds, and
on my breast a pendant, shaped like a
heart, all of one bright red stone, set
round with pearls."

Miss Aisle gave a slight start, —

And your bracelets ? " asked she,

curiously.

They had clasps to match the pendant."
Oh, heart-shaped carbuncles, set round

with pearls ? " queried the elder.

They might be carbuncles ; I do not
know."

Did you never see trinkets like those ? "

Never, except In my dream. Mrs
Bemerton had nothing like them."

No ; but Paul's mother had," flashed
through Miss Aisle's mind. She kept
the thought to herself, but she listened
with a difference. The jewels had given
a new Import to the dreamer's narrative.
Who was with you In the carriage ? "

Oh, my mother. In a dove-coloured
satin, and her father, an old gentleman,
with gold spectacles and silvery hair ; and
he held her hand In his, as something
too precious to release."

And the bridegroom ? "

He was waltlno- with some other gentlemen
at the top of the steps. He was a tall,

fine man, with a bronzed face, and a great,
nut-brown beard, and the most steadfast
brown eyes I ever saw. He did not seem
to be more than thirty, though he had so
large a beard. But the strangest thing
was his dress. He wore cherry-coloured
trousers, and two jackets — absolutely two
dark-blue jackets, laced over with gold
cord, and the one hung loose upon his
shoulder, like a mantle over the other.
I never saw such a thing. And his cap
was just as curious, like a red coffee-bag
hano-ino- out of a black muff"

Did you never see an officer in such a
uniform ? " was asked, half incredulously.

An officer's uniform ! Oh ! was it '^ "
said Euretta spontaneously, — " then that
clears it up. That was the only fantastic
thing about my dream. I thought he
must be a foreigner by the dress and
beard. Well, Miss Ainslie, if ever I see
that man I shall know him, whatever he
may wear ; I have dreamed of him so
frequently. Dreamed that he had helped
to restore mother and me to our relatives

and our rights, and that I loved him
dearly. I told no one, lest I should be
laughed at for my folly ; but it was my love
for my dream-bridegroom set me studying,
in every spare moment, how to acquit
myself in the sphere to which he clearly
belonged. Literature, music, manners,
had to be cultivated. The little sets of
china were not bought for child's play,
Miss Ainslie. In my private hours I
played the hostess, copying what I had
seen when I helped the housekeeper
at Stonar, and at Mrs Bemerton's. My
mother never forgot she was a lady, at
any time ; and perhaps It came easier tome.
At all events, if my dream does not
become a reality (though I feel assured it
will some day), I have been a gainer by it,
if only in my introduction to you."

Thank you, my dear," said Miss Ains-lie,
pressing her hand ; " I feel the delicate
compliment. So far, your singular dream
has done no harm ; but I would advise
you not to indulge in any morbid sentiment
for what may only be a freak of



memory or imagination. In the first
place, the church with a tower at the side,
is an absurdity, and no English officer
would be allowed to wear a beard. That
is equally absurd. But dreams are merely
vagaries of memory. You may, at sometime
of your life, have seen the regimentals
at Deal or Sandwich, and unconsciously
reproduced them in your sleep ; and as for
the jewels — well, I confess that is singular."
But she did not say why.

FULFILMENT.

'Most simultaneously with the
arrival of Mrs Fleming's letter
at Ainslie Holt, Mrs Norreys
welcomed a long looked for
communication from her son Cecil. She
tore it open eagerly, but as she read, her
first delight gave way to sickening apprehension.


Hospital, Scutari,

'"'' February 1853.

My Dear Mother, — I dare say you
think it is a confounded long while since
you heard from me, but you may thank
God your son is alive, or has a finger to

hold a pen. I've had a harder fight for it
here than we had at Balaclava, and no
mistake ; and that brave fellow, Ainslie, is
pretty nearly in the same boat, I suppose
you've read all about the battles in the
papers, so I need not waste any strength
or ink on them, for they are both scarce
articles. You will have heard what a
gallant dash Ainslie made to rescue me
when I was awfully wounded, and almost
dropping from my horse. It was the
pluckiest thing imaginable. The yelling
demons were all around me, thrusting,
slashing, pistoling. He rode them
down, caught me falling, and fought his
way back with the head of a Cossack lance
in his own thorn ! That he should do it
for me was the noblest thing of all, for I
had done him many an ill turn, and he
knew it. Even as a lad I crowed over
him. Let no one say a word against him
in my hearing again ! He carried me to
the doctors and waited, with the lance-head
in his thigh, till I was examined,
before he would have his own wound

VOL. II. K

dressed ! I was told this, for I remembered
nothing until I found myself in our
field-hospital minus a leg and my left arm ;
a mass of plaister and bandages. Ainslie
they have made him a major, I am told
would not stay in hospital a second day,
but went back to duty with his wound
plugged up and plaistered. Then on the
5th November came Inkerman, and, with
his wound all unhealed, he rode through
the foe with a remnant of our Liq^ht Brigade
into another valley of slaughter.

When all was over and the victory
ours, Ainslie was found lying by the side
of his dead charger, and brought into
hospital. He might have been a target for
shot and shell, poor fellow ! One bullet
had gone clean through his chest and out at
his back. Our surer-eon thought he was
done for, but he is better than I am now,
for he is neither maimed nor disfigured.
He lay aside me, probed and plugged, and
strapped, and was like myself doing fairly
well, when a hurricane swooped down upon
us, carrying away tent, blankets, and every

mortal thing that could screen or shelter
us. The rain was as pitiless as the blast,
and what the storms of the Crimea could
be to wounded men is past telling. How
we lived through it all is a miracle. I heard
that Lord Raglan sat up to his knees in mud,
his tent — nowhere. The Russian sleet killed
as surely as the Russian guns. Yet Ainslie
and I survived to be draughted to Scutari.
Fancy the horrors of that voyage
across the stormy Black Sea to badly
wounded men, in a vessel loaded with sick
and wounded ! It was horrible to us ;
what must it have been to the privates
lying crowded together in rows on the
open deck ? And the hospital at Scutari
was not much better. It was so full that
we had to be laid in one of the corridors,
lucky in having a mattrass between our
bodies and the cold, damp, tiled floor. We
officers fared little better than the men.
And until Miss Nightingale came, there
was neither order, nor comfort, nor decency
; towels, spoons, cans, clothes, and
all decent appliances were wanting.

Kits and baQ:2fa.o-e had been left unclaimed,
or lay on the quay, at the mercy
of plunderers. Men died and were buried,
whose very names were unknown. We
were fortunate in securing the attention of
a young fellow, a recruit from the Kentish
Militia, who had been seized with cholera
on landing, and been left behind. He was
still weak, but handy and willing, and I
believe Ainslie owes his life to Dan Rye's
care of him as a countryman. We owe
the young fellow something more, for he
has helped us to a discovery Uncle Copeland
would give all he is worth to know.
He hunted up our baggage on the quay,
and on turning over Ainslie's traps for a
clean shirt, out tumbled a miniature ; one
of the loveliest girl faces I ever set eyes
on. I saw Ainslie's countenance change,
but I thought Dan had lost his wits. He
held it at arm's-length, and cried, — ' Why,
Captain, where did you get that ? It's
our Hetty ! ' and then the poor chap
propped on the damp floor and fairly
sobbed over it. He had fought his own

brother, left home and enlisted, all on account
of the girl. And the captain, ill ashe
was, seemed as crazy to get hold of the
picture, and to know who she was. He
had fallen in love with a face only seen
once, or with the picture. And who
think you she is ? Who, but my own
cousin, Euretta Fleming ! ! Cousin Margaret
and her child were not drowned.
Tell uncle they are living at Sandwich !
The picture was taken by Pierce Fathers
who is with our army. Dan rejoined
his regiment a month ago ; and both
Ainslie and I may be expected home erelong
— invalided. ."

There were a few other unimportant
items, but they and the signature might
have been blank for all the heed Mrs
Norreys paid to them.

What did all her secret scheming; to remove
the vicar of St Mary's avail, if Cecil
came home full of his discovery, to bring
disgrace on her head and blight all their
hopes. How many pictures were there of

the girl ? They seemed to multiply Hke
mushrooms, and her danger with them !
Could nothing be done to avert the impending
catastrophe ?

Surely her pillow was neither of roses
nor poppies that week. She had made it
for herself, whatever it might be. But
that did not make it the softer or more,
composing.

When the Rev. Austin Ughtred and his
still pretty wife Margaret were on their
way to St Mildred's Rectory, accompanied
by William Ashurst and his homely wife,
who were to occupy a charming cottage
close beside, Euretta had only to say farewell
to the Ryes and the Cunningham,
before hastening back to Ainslie Holt.
She had heard all there was to tell of the
ancient flint church, and the charming
rectory covered with ivy ; and of the home
of the Ashursts close beside ; and of the
harvest the blind musician expected to
reap in the adjacent flourishing watering-place.
She had done her best to comfort
Mrs Rye for 'the departure of her son

Dan, and shaken hands with the good
doctor ; and then Sandwich was left
behind.

She went back to her duties, rejoicing
in the serene happiness of her mother and
her old friends, and picturing in her mind's
eye the homes to which they had gone.
Never was self or her own future less in
her mind.

Miss Ainslie had found her way to
Canterbury in the carriage instead of sending
the phaeton to meet Euretta. She
had been away three weeks, and in the
interim the trees donned their robes of
April's tenderest green. Showers of 
overhung the hedgerows ;
young hops were climbing up their poles
ambitiously, birds were twittering and
singing on the boughs, and all things
seemed to rejoice in the freshness of new
hopes.

The lodge-keeper stood at the already
open gates, and as they passed through,
cried out excitedly, —

Their's Captain Norreys and another

officer come from Dover with news of the
master ! " and then, through some private
understanding with the old coachman or
his whip, the horses seemed to fly along
the green avenue.

They had a glimpse of strange faces at
a window ; of servants on the steps, and
in the hall where everyone had an air of
unwonted excited. t.

Come with me, I feel faint," Alas Miss
Ainslie's low-voiced request to Euretta, as
she clung to her arm fc support, fearing
she knew not what.

The strangers had evidently watched
them alight. As they entered the 
to their left, the two men turned
from the great mullions window to salute
them. The liofht was full on the faces of
all. And what saw they ?

Two bearded men, in woefully shabby
and dilapidated hussar uniforms, the one
with his arm in a sling, and a stick to
support his steps ; the other with an empty
sleeve and a wooden substitute for a leo;
both pale and emaciated.

'i> '

But why do the two men stand amazed,
and turn as if to question each other's eyes ?

And why does Euretta's head swim, and
her cheek pale ? Does she wonder which
of these is Captain Norreys ? For there
before her stands the bearded bridegroom
of her dreams !

A supreme effort, and she is apparently
herself again. But Mos Ainslie has felt
her companion start, and her arm tremble,
and the quick change of Euretta's countenance
is not Ic ici on her, any more than
the sudden movement of the two men.

She herself stands all but motionless,
only a slight movement of head and eyes
from one to another betrays bewilderment,
and an effort to recognise Captain Norreys
in either of the bearded strangers before
her,

Aunt Alicia ! do you not know mie ? "
cries the one with the stick, advancing ;
and in another moment Miss Ainslie's
arms are round her nephew's neck, and
Euretta knows once for all that her dream-husband
was Major Ainslie.

Ere Miss Aisle's imitation had time to
subside, or she could shake hands with
Captain Norreys, her nephew whispered
in her ear, —

"Who is your young friend? Introduce
us."

As the words " Miss Euretta Fleming"
left her lips, the two invalided officers
again exchanged glances.

Good heavens ! I knew it ! " exclaimed
the major, with strange emotion ; " this
must be the finger of God! Miss Fleming,
have you any relations named Nor-rays
? "

Yes, Major Ainslie " (how sweet his
name seemed to sound from her lips !) ; " I
have an aunt and some cousins, but my
grandfather discarded my mother, and they
all refuse to acknowledge us."

All ?" echoed Captain Norreys. "Nay,
/ am ready to claim you as my cousin
Fleming " — he put out his only hand to
meets hers. " And there must be surely
some mistake ; Uncle Copeland does not
know he has a daughter or a grandchild

living. The great grief of his Hfe is the
belief that both perished in the wreck of
the EiLvetta.

There is no mistake. The letter
Aunt Norreys wrote, when my mother lay
ill and helpless after the shipwreck, casting
off all ties, the vicar of St Mary's carried
to London, and laid before Mr Martin
Norreys, and he only confirmed it."

The maimed officer looked incredulous.

What ! Martin .^ my brother Martin ?
It is impossible ! "

It is true, sir."

Then must it be searched into. There
is some mistake somewhere. I must hasten
to London, and set the matter at rest.
Martin could not lend himself to cruelty or
dishonour. And that letter must be a
forgery."

The Aisles had listened with strong
interest. Questions and answers followed
quickly, but when Dan Rye's revelation
was referred to, there seemed some reticence
as to the primary cause.

Neither the major nor the captain said a

word about the portrait over which the
private had wept so sorely ; or of the
rapid promotion it was likely to bring to
Dan.

It was not until a couple of weeks had
flown, and Captain Norreys was on his
way to London to dispel what was to him
a mystery, that Major Ainslie took occasion
to ask Euretta, whose bewildered
movements he had followed with voiceless
adoration, —

Do you remember at any time standing
on a drawbridge whilst your portrait
was surreptitiously sketched ? "

The crimson mounted to her forehead
as she answered indignantly, —

I can never forget the impertinence.
A v;ell-dressed lady would have been
spared the indignity offered to the poverty
of my appearance."

Can you never forgive it, Miss Fleming
? Artists study only the picturesque
and beautiful ; he took a picture — and a
face. See, it is here," and he drew a
miniature from his breast. " Pierce Fathers

little foresaw all the consequences of
his impromptu sketch. The face fascinated
me. I scarcely dared ask myself what was
the class of the original. I saw only a
pure, sweet countenance, filled with dreams
of something ho-her than her lot. It has
been my constant companion for three
years. I had grown to love it as an ideal,
and determined to seek out the original if
I lived to return, little thinking that my
wounds and helplessness would bring me
into contact with Dan Rye, or the clue he
held to your identity. We travel ways
unknown to all but God, to the very haven
of our rest. Little thought either Norreys
or myself, as we lay helpless with but a
mattress between our machine bodies and
the cold, damp tiles at Scutari, that our
very wounds and hardships were bringing
us nearer to such a discovery ; he of a
long-lost cousin, I of a long sought — love!'
His voice had sunk low, but the tender
tones had reached her heart through the
small shell-like ear bent so low. There
was a slight change in his manner, but

he was not less earnest as he went on,
after a momentary pause, during which
her hand was taken prisoner, — " Miss
Fleming, I am not very presentable just
at present, have brought home a great
Russian beard, and have an hospital savour
about me ; but if you can overlook these
blemishes, and take pity on one who has
cherished your painted semblance without
a hope of finding the original, you will do
more to restore me to health and society
than all the surgeons in England."

Do I need to tell how she answered this
lover of her dreams, or how, in spite of his
bushy beard, his lips found hers ?

Do I need to tell how differently the
brother-officer was received by Martin
Copeland and the Norreys, mother and
son ?

On the two latter, the shame and the exposure
fell crushingly. Mrs Norreys had
one of her old attacks, but though she
lingered, she never rallied.

Those she had injured she never lived
to see. It was the sorest punishment

that her own son should have exposed
her.

Martin Norreys, who had held his head
so high in the commercial and social world,
as a man of undoubted integrity, was, if
possible, still more deeply affected. He
would not have wronged a human being,
and had all along been sensitively alive to
the wrongs done alike to his good uncle
and those he mourned as lost. He was
not altogether sorry to see it righted, at
any cost. In extenuation of his own complicity,
he could but plead his own dilemma,
and urge that he had sent back fifty pounds
in the very letter that had wrought the
woe, and followed it with other notes from
time to time. And surely enough the fifty-pound
note was found stowed away in the
rector's escritoire when the aunt's letter
was brought forth again as a testimony
against the writer. These notes, and an
investment privately made in the name of
Euretta Fleming, saved the merchant
cousin from sharing to the full his mother's
disgrace.

Euretta's dream came true in the autumn.
She wore as a bride the jewels of Paul
Ainslie's mother, and Miss Ainslie clasped
them proudly on her neck and arms. And
when Martin Copeland insisted on the
marriage being solemnised in the church
where her mother and he himself had
been married, the long drive from Kensington
to St George's, Bloomsbury, was
no revelation to her. The very edifice
had been prefigured. " By many Ways
Unknown " had father and daughter come
together, and the bridegroom found his
bride — a bride who had made it so long-her
study to fill the higher place appointed
for her.

The Holt had never fairer or fitter
mistress, never one more beloved. And
there was never more welcome guest under
its roof than the artist Pierce Hathersage,
when he too came back from the Crimea
with a beard a foot long. If the picture
painted on Sandwich Bridge had not
made his fortune, it had gone a long way
towards it.

WAS alone in the world — or I
thought I was, which amounted
to pretty much the same in its
mental and moral effects. My
mother died when I was so young that I
had only a shadowy remembrance of a pale
face, and a long, last clasp to her loving
heart. I had been my father's pet and
darling, and now he was dead too, and his
will had assigned me, just like a bale of
goods, to the care and guardianship of his
brother, a doctor, whose home lay amongst
the picturesque mountains of Cumberland.

VOL. II. L

I was " too impulsive," said the will, and
would throw myself and my money away
before I knew the value of either, if I had
no one to take care of me ; and so when
my poor father died in the south of France,
where we had gone to winter, Uncle Ritson,
who came barely in time to lay him in his
foreign grave, carried me off at once to his
house on the bleak hillside, gave me a kiss
as he lifted me out of the stuffy vehicle
which had conveyed us from the station,
presented me to my aunt and cousins with
a " Well, here's Adela ! " and told me to
consider myself at home.

It was the beginning of January, intensely
cold. The sudden change from a
warmer climate had sensibly affected me ;
I was chilled under all my furs, and perhaps
more chilled by the restraining influence
of my father's will, having pondered the
too impulsive " all through the journey.

Certainly I was not " too impulsive " on
my entrance to my new " home,"

Aunt and cousins had met me on the
threshold with warm welcomes, pressed

to remove my wraps and to make me comfortable.
There was a huge fire blazing
on the hearth, a tea-table piled with north-country
luxuries, and all that should have
made me feel at home ; but something was
wanting, and instead of responding to their
greetings in my own natural fashion, I
dropped into a seat, after the first glance
round, and covering my face with my
hands, burst into tears.

I have small, thin, quick ears. I overheard
Aunt Ritson whisper to Bella and
Winnie, as she drew them back, —

Hush, it's but natural, poor bairn; leave
your cousin alone, lasses ; she will come to
herself all the sooner."

And I did come to myself ; but whether
my tears had fallen frostily on their hot
hearth, or we travellers had brought a chill
in with us, or my own manner did not invite
effusion, a certain air of restraint
seemed to grow upon us ; and when I was
shown to the room set apart for me, and
left in its privacy, I flung myself on the
bed and sobbed in passionate grief for my

dead father, declaring that I was "alone in
the world, utterly alone."

This feeling grew upon me. Looking
back, I am conscious that it was much my
own fault ; that I had not responded with
sufficient warmth and gratitude to the relatives
who had made room in their household
for one they had not seen since she
was a baby, and yet had met with open
arms and hearts.

They had heard that I was gushing and
exuberant, a creature of impulse, and finding
me reserved, and languid, concluded
that I, accustomed to elegance and luxury,
could not brook the homeliness and retirement
of my new life. I was rich, and
they were not. They mistook my morbid
melancholy for pride, and ceased to press
their society or attentions on me, lest
I should attribute to them mercenary
motives.

I see it all now ; but then I was blind.

There was another grief at my heart
besides sorrow for my dead parent ; and, I
fear, whenever mv thoughts flew to that

lonely grave among the Pyrenees, I
questioned the policy which had isolated
me from the world — the world in which
my hero lived and moved, — and had
prisoned my free soul amongst those unresponsive
walls of stone.

In this rhapsody I did not apostrophise
alone the four walls of the solid stonehouse
that, set against the mountain-side
with a background of pine, larch and
mountain ash, looked so cold and grey,
staring with its many lidless eyes from its
rocky perch above the straggling lake-village,
on the steep unguarded roadway
in front, and the narrow strips of garden
ground stretching like green arms on
either side.

No ; I held converse with the mountains.
They were to me the barriers between
love, and life, and happiness, but
it was only on their solitary heights I felt
free to q-ive the feeling utterance.

The thrifty household ways of my aunt
and cousins, which kept them ever busy,
were strange to me. My dainty fingers

had no acquaintance with rowing-pin or
paste-board. It was not I who kept so
bright the mirror in which I saw my own
beauty, ay, and my own unhappiness reflected.
I was supposed to be mourning,
and, with mistaken delicacy, was left todo
only what I pleased, and that was —
nothing.

Had Uncle Ritson known it, or how I
spent my time, he would have shaken me
up like a bottle of physic ; and I should
have been the better for it. But whether
on foot, or horseback, or in his ancient
gig, he was off in a morning, and frequently
was absent all the day. His
patients were scattered, and his rounds
extended.

I, having no occupation for hands or
energies, feeling myself something apart
from the rest, was myself off and away up
the breezy hillside to the lovely margin
of the lake, or into the most secluded
glens, my only companion being my faithful
dog ; and there, where there was only
the wind to answer me, I poured forth all

the pent-up feelings of my heart ; and oft
my gusts of passionate emotion found
utterance in song. At times I took a
pencil and sketch-book with me in these
wanderings ; but there was ever one
figure in the foreground of the most picturesque
scene, and often enough the
figure was there alone, the adjuncts all
forgotten.

At first Bella or Winnie had borne me
company ; but I think they saw my longing
to be alone ; and I had my way, not
without many cautions from my aunt.
What were perils to me, chafing against
the restraint of my father's will, crying
from the depths of my inmost heart for
the banished love who would never find
me in those solitudes, and longing for
winCTs to traverse land and sea until I
found my home on his faithful bosom ?

Lost in abstraction, all dangers were
forgotten, and I had nearly paid the
penalty but for a guardian angel little
dreamed off.

My first peril was from the mountain

mist, which came down and around me
with bewildering suddenness, blotting out
the landscape far and near. Still I thought
I knew the way, and was stepping onwards,
though with caution, when my dress
was clutched from behind, as I fancied, by
some bush. Turning to disentangle it, I
was confronted with what seemed an awful
apparition looming through the misty veil,
and, with a suppressed cry, I stood still in
affright.

I saw a woman's form, bent with age ;
a face intersected with lines and wrinkles,
like a map, from which nose and chin stood
out like mountain-peaks, and where the
sunken eyes gleamed like the fiery depths
of two volcanic craters,

Stop, my teddy!" she cried; " the gates
of death are open before ye ! Tak' my
hand, and let me lead you ; and thank
God, my bairn, that Elspa was near you
in your peril."

I had heard of Elspa as a woman who
dealt in herbs and simples ; but I had also
heard of her as one with an uncanny reputation.

She was spoken of as " the wise
woman," but the words were uttered as if
they meant " witch."

I confess I was half-afraid to accept her
guidance ; but she stamped her foot, and
by gesture strong as words gave me to
understand I had been walking towards a
precipice, and three steps further would
have borne me to destruction.

What landmark she had, I know not ;
but I think she seemed to feel her way
with her feet. At all events, after about
an hour's cautious stepping, we stood below
the mist, the blue lake Meanings like a
mirror still further down, and my uncle's
house within sight. Conscious of the service
she had rendered,. I did not confine
my thanks to words, but was liberal with
my coin.

As she took ' the silver,' she scanned my
face curiously, then seized my hand, and
peered into it closely, whilst a sort of
creepy sensation (excusable in a girl of
nineteen) stole over me.

Once, twice, thrice ! Three perils, my

bonnie teddy. One is past ; the others lie
before. Perils of your ain seeking. The
gates of death stand in the path of your
true love. Open them not with rash or
heedless hands before the year be out, or
love may mourn for love that could bide.
The air of mountain and of lake is na gude
for ye, bairn. Keep mair at hame, and
innate misdoubt'. There's a gude God
boon a' ! Remember, one danger is over-past.
Tak' heed ye seek not the others ;
and cinna scoff at old Elspa's warning
Words.'

The old woman trotted off with her
basket on her arm, a rusty black bonnet
on her head, garments poor but clean, and
only a small check woollen handkerchief to
protect her from the chilly mountain mists,

I had scarcely decided whether to laugh
at her wanderings, or to yield to the
superstitious feeling she had awakened,
when I opened the house door, to find all
in a state of excitement.

It was long past our dinner hour, and
mv absence had alarmed them. Of course

I explained the cause of my delay ; and it
was only by Aunt Ritson's agitation that
I fully comprehended the danger I had
escaped. I think her motherly concern
made me more communicative than usual.
We were still speaking of Elspa when my
uncle came in.

Ah ! " said he, as Winnie helped him
off with his overcoat, "ah! my dear, you
might thank your stars Elspa was on the
mountain side. I daresay she had followed
you. The old Scotchman is shrewd and
far-seeing. She has turned her eighty years'
experience to account; has a good practical
knowledge of common ailments and curative
simples. I should lose my own creditor
I miof-ht do worse than take her as an
assistant," and he laughed. " Then she
can read character with any physiognomist
in the world, and the silly folk think her
prophetic, when she is only clear-eyed."

I think uncle was using; an invisible
probe. I know I coloured, and he laughed
again, but said nothing more — nor did I.

The excitement had not all been on my

account. Bella had received an invitation
to spend some months with a newly-married
friend in London, and good-natured Winnie
was in hio^h o-lee. Even aunt acknowledged
it was a chance not to be missed, if
possible ; and I saw her glance furtively
in Uncle Ritson's face, which I fancied was
graver than usual. Still, possibilities were
not discussed in my presence. It was not
until I had retired to my pretty room for the
night that I overheard the sisters discussing
the problem, unmindful of the thin partition
between the head of my bed and theirs.

I found that money — or its scarcity —
stood in the way, and heard the chances
of the matrimonial market calculated with
a balance greatly in favour of London.
Money ! How I hated the word ! I
would have given every shilling I had, to
be assured that Edgar Neville was true tome,
and would seek me out when the
period of probation prescribed by my
father was gone by. But where could he
seek for me ? Correspondence had been
forbidden. He knew not mv address.

and my father had withheld Edgar's from
me. Ah ! how he repented before he died !
How glad he would then have been to
leave me in those strong protective arms !

I soon bridged the monetary difficulty
over in spite of uncle's opposition, and I
think I showed something of my old self
in the spirit with which I entered into the
needful preparations for Miss Ritson's
launch on the sea of London society, little
thinking what might be its import to myself.

It was May when she went. I had
subsisted that she should lighten her
mourning, being about to visit a bride — a
hint she seemed glad to take, for her
pretty lavender bonnet set off her face
much better than her heavy crape. She
had kissed me very heartily before she
got into the gig beside her father to be
driven to the station, to which her boxes
had already been despatched, and I felt
more satisfied with myself than I had
done since I had crossed the Cumberland
border.

Letters filled with the wonders she had

seen, and the places she had visited, broke
up the monotony of our lives. Then came
one from Hastings, in which she told of
her introduction to a Mr Neville.

I think my pulse stopped as Winnie read
out the name. I know aunt asked me if I
was ill — if the heat was too much for me.
But I drew myself together, said "nothing"
was the matter, and tried to convince myself
the name was a common one.

Again and again we heard of this same
Mr Neville, and my heart began to be
torn with doubts and suspicions, and a
very demon of jealousy seemed to take
possession of my breast. I felt assured
that Bella was in love with him, and that
he was the Edgar Neville of my adoration
; all that she stated of his appearance
and family were convincing.

At length a letter came, addressed in a
manly hand to Uncle Ritson, with Edgar's
well-known crest upon the seal. It was a
proposal for my cousin's hand.

My head swam round, but I mustered
courage to ask Mr Neville's Christian

name. He had "merely signed J. E.
Neville." "Ah, that was it, sure enough
John Edgar ! " prompted some taunting
fiend. I had my back towards my uncle,
standing in the doorway, as I asked. No
one noticed how I staggered into the
hall, or how I snatched my hat from the
stand and darted up the mountain-side to
cool my fevered brow and still my throbbing
pulses. How I went or where I went
I could never remember ; I have some
recollection of falling as I bounded across
a beck, of old Elspa's face bending over
me, and then no more, until I found myself
in my own snowy bed, with Winnie
watching me, and an array of physic bottles
on the window seat.

Elspa had found me where I had fallen,
half-in, half-out of the stream. Unable to
drag me thence, she had summoned help
with a peculiar whistle she kept suspended
to her girdle, the shrill note of which no
shepherd dared to disobey.

It brought a couple of shepherds to the
spot. My limbs were lifted out of the

stream — she had already bathed my brow,
and plaistered up my temple — and then I
was carried slowly down to interrupt the
answer Uncle Ritson was sending to Bella
and Mr Neville.

My fall and the immersion were accredited
with the long fever which almost
baffled my good uncle's skill. If anyone
suspected otherwise it was old Elspa, but
she was too " wise " to revert to the subject
when she came to see me ere my convalescence.


Very slow was my recovery, retarded no
doubt by the scraps Winnie read to me as
pleasant news from her sister's letters. It
was now " Eddie" this, or " Eddie" that,
and as I shut my eyes and ground my
teeth, the better to endure, I felt indignant
that my noble-fronted Edgar should have
a pet name like a baby. To me he had
the majesty of a monarch. How could
she address him so ?

I was downstairs before the Christmas
came, able and willing to assist my aunt
in her multitudinous preparations, and

tried to smile and look gratified during the
Christmas merry-making. I had heard, but
scarcely seemed to realise, that Bella was
to be married early in the new year, and that
she and her husband would come to spend
the honeymoon with us, and I was doing
my best to nerve myself for the meeting.

The old year was closing in, Elspa —
who else ? — came up to the house with a
letter she had found lying in a by-road.
It should have been delivered some days
previously ; and it was supposed that the
postman had taken more to drink than
was good for him during the Christmas
carding," and dropped it by the way.

Goodness ! how that letter stunned me !
Bella was by that time married. She and
her husband were to be with us on New
Year's Day, and they should bring with
them a New Year's gift for cousin Delays
a thank-offering for bringing them together.
Their photographs were enclosed.

I saw only the one. Yes, it was
Edgar's ! There was no mistake.

The house was at once in a bustle of pre-vol.

II. M

marathon. Again I slipped out, to hide my
agony and prepare myself for the coming
trial.

Dreamily I went along. I saw nothing
before me but that meeting on the morrow
and the revelation it was sure to bring.
My mind seemed a chaos, in which thought
was lost.

All at once — for I had taken no note of
my path — I found myself on the reedy
margin of the lake, as the silver circle of
the moon was rising above the mountain-tops.
And there I stood, looking on the
dark waters, whilst something seemed to
whisper to me that there was peace ; that
I need not meet the proud bride and my
inconstant love unless I chose ; that I
might hide my sorrows and my secret
there, and none be the wiser.

My foot was on the brink. There was
a step on the stones behind me. I turned,
and r think my half-formed purpose was
visible in my face, as I once more confronted
old Elspa, weird and witch-like in
the moonlight, a warning finger held up.

Sharp were her words, sharp as my need.
She bade me go down on my knees, and
thank God that He had sent her to save
me from my third peril — the peril of body
and soul. What was I puling over ? What
right had I to fling away the life that was
given for the service of others ? How
dared I tempt death, loving the creature
more than the Creator. She had heard
me raving to the winds when I thought
myself alone, and had kept a watch upon
me. And she bade me go back home, and
pray to be forgiven, and to " trust the Lord
to make His dark ways plain."

She took me by the hand, and led me
back like a penitent child ; said to my
aunt that she thought I was not well, and,
by her leave, would watch me through the
night. Something she gave me too, and
I slept.

When I awoke a chaise was at the gate ;
and before I could fasten my dress with
my trembling fingers, Bella had burst in,
radiant with happiness, and flung her arms
around me.

Come, Adela, make haste ! " said she.
'' Edward is all impatience to see you,
and show you our New Year's gift."

Edward ! " I gasped.

Yes, my dear, Edward ! Did you not
know his name ? "

It was all a tangle. I followed her to
the living-room below, where the great
holly-bush was hanging, and there stood a
stranger, who was introduced to me as
James Edward Neville, my new cousin —
and surely there also stood Edgar, my own
Edgar ; for he held out his arms, and caught
me as I was falling.

He had been best man at his cousin's
wedding, and Bella had only seen him a
few days previously. The postman must
have lost another letter, one Edgar had
sent to me. There were two photographs
sent ; and by some mischance had been
placed in the wrong envelopes. No doubt
if the other lost letter were recovered,
Edward's portrait would come to light.

Old Elspa kept my secret well. Better
than I deserved. But I never forgot the

i8i

lesson she had taught me. And when
Edgar carried me away from Cumberland
as proud a wife as Bella, we took good
care of old Elspa for the rest of her
days.

CHAPTER I.

THE FARM.

CANNOT stand this, mother;
I shall have to leave home
and go to service," said
Elizabeth Birch, with an air
of sudden determination ; and anyone
scanning her grave and thoughtful countenance
might see that though the announcement

was sudden, it had been
weighed and deliberated long beforehand.

Then, if you go, I go ! " put in her
younger sister Sarah, with a toss of her
head ; " I don't think home is any more
desirable for me than for you, and it will
be worse when you are gone. Besides, I
am tired of this humdrum village, where
everybody knows everybody else's business
; and the rector's wife thinks it her
business to lecture one on the smallest
provocation ; " and as she spoke Sarah
swept the fragments of a broken cup and
saucer from the hearth, and prepared to
remove the tea things.

Nay, Sarah ; you had better stay and
be a comfort to mother. You are too
young to leave home, and have not my
reasons," remonstrated her sister, who stood,
bonnet in hand, by the open window.

My girls," said the mother — a quiet
little woman, in a printed cotton gown, as
clean and neat, save for a recent stain, as
if fresh from the wash, though half a week's
work had been done in it. " My girls,"

she repeated, with a troubled countenance,
don't be rash ! Do think twice before
you talk of leaving home. Things may not
be very pleasant here ; but do you dream
that everything runs smoothly elsewhere ?
You will not find strangers more angelic
than the people at home, and — "

Not than yourself, dear mother ! " cried
Elizabeth, flinging herself on the breast of
her good parent ; " I know that, but I may
escape the pain of seeing ill-usage I am
powerless to prevent ; and I must go,
mother, for if I saw my father raise his
hand to strike you again, as he did this
afternoon, my temper would get the better
of me, and I should do him some
mischief which I might repent to the
end of my days ; then, I should not
be taunted with idleness, and " — here her
voice sank to a whisper — " I should be
less likely to fret about Tom, away from
Kitknoll."

A warm tear fell on the girl's forehead
as, locked in close embrace, she knelt at
her mother's feet on the red-tiled kitchen

floor. Sighing heavily, Mrs Birch assented,
sadly, —

Well, Elizabeth, perhaps you are right.
I have seen the curb you put upon your
strong temper, and you are best away from
temptation, for you might not always be
able to restrain yourself; and, my girl, you
may, perhaps, forget Tom amid fresh
scenes."

Nay, nay ; I shall never forget him,
but I can bear my trouble better among
strangers."

Then is all really over between
you ? "

Yes, all ! He says his friends are
against his marrying me because of father ;
and I gave him back his promise this afternoon,
when we met at the copse gate. If
he is so weak as to be prejudiced against
me for no fault of mine, he does not love
me so well as I thought ; and I am too
proud to enter any family where my own
would be despised, so I said it was best
we parted at once, since no good seemed
to come of our keeping company."

Then it was you broke it off, and not
Tom ? "

It was, and it wasn't, mother. Tom's
never been the same since old Ahead
picked father up drunk on the road from
Brassington Fair, and there isn't one of the
Ashteads who has looked civilly at me
since. Every now and again Tom has
told me the scornful things his sister Matte
has said ; and, after he told me last week
of the quarrel they had at the farm about
me, when his father said Ralph Birch was
swallowing his uncle's acres so fast there
would be nothing left for lad or lass — he
repeated it as if the speech weighed on his
mind,"

"Well, Elizabeth," interrupted Mrs
Birch soberly, " Farmer Ashtead was
not far out. The land remains, but it is
losing in value, and your father is swallowing
the produce — you cannot blame him for
speaking that which is so well known."

No, mother," responded Elizabeth,
looking steadfastly into the fire ; " it was
not so much what he said as the way he

said it ! If I had taken it up then, I should
have lost my temper, so I waited until I
had thought it over. He said I was
sullen,' and I let him think so ; it was
better than saying in anger what I should
regret when cool. But all week I have
thought it over, and when we met to-day
I gave him his liberty. He seemed half
ashamed, but he could not deny that he
had changed, and was willing to be released.
He cried, and said it was all through my
father and his family, and that he should
always love and respect me, and should
never marry anyone else. And I had
hard work to keep from crying too ; but I
knew I was doing right — and when I came
home, mother, and saw father throw his
cup and saucer at you, and strike you
because you gave him tea without brandy,
and heard his dreadful language, I was sure
I had done riofht."

Weil, dear, I hope you have. We
have all our burdens to bear, but God suits
the back to the burden, and I trust He will
enable you to bear yours with a brave

heart ! " and tears rolled down the tender
mother's cheeks.

No fear, mother! but I must go away
where I can see no scornful finger pointed
at me as being jilted. But here comes
Sarah," and she rose from her mother's
feet to carry her bonnet and shawl upstairs,
whilst her sister placed the newly-washed
tea things in a cupboard by the chimney
side, and asked, " What were you two
talking about ? "

The uncle of Ralph Birch had been a
grazing farmer, and, never having married,
had taken charge of his nephew from youth
upwards, had encouraged him to marry,
and at his death left him the farm and the
cattle upon it.

Ralph's wife, when he married her, had
been a lively little lass enough, but she
toned down to quietude before three years
had gone by. She was the younger of two
sisters with whom Ralph had been shilly-shallying
until, after a quarrel with the
elder, he married Bess offhand to spite
the other — a woman of strong will and

passions, who never forgave either him or
her sister.

Married though he was, she resumed
her influence over him. He began to twit
his wife with her meekness and lack of
spirit, and to declare openly that he had
married the wrong woman. Not all at
once this ; two sons and two daughters
were born to him before the uncle's death
left him the possessor of farm and lands
worth sixteen thousand pounds ; free to
deal with property or wife as he listed.
Whether he had hitherto worn a mask to
deceive his good uncle, or that the mere
fact of behoof his own master removed the
necessity for restraint, and overpowered his
self-control, the result was the same.

He had frequently come home from fair
or market the worse for liquor in his uncle's
time, but the drovers sent on with the
cattle could tell that he was sober enough
whilst selling or buying, and that if he got
more than was brood for him it was at the
house of his sister-in-law, then married to
a publican named Hales, whose roadside

inn, " The Thirsty Traveller," was in his
way to or from either Broomwood or
Brassington.

Sarah, the youngest girl, was ten years
of age when the old grazier died, and,
prior to that deplorable event, the children
had all been sent to good schools, Mrs
Birch herself having had a fair education
for a farmer's daughter of that period.
But no sooner was old Birch laid in the
grave, than Martha Hales began to insinuate
that, unless they were meant to be
fine gentlemen and ladies, it was quite time
her nephews and nieces were taken from
school, and set to work.

The suggestion fermented in Ralph's
mind like yeast ; he was quick to enunciate
the doctrine at home, and to act up to it.
In the case of Reuben, the eldest, then
close on sixteen, Mrs Birch consented
readily ; but she did her best to obtain for
the others also the advantages he had
enjoyed.

It was useless. Before the year was
out, thanks to Mrs Hales, Reuben and

James were both at work on the farm, and
Elizabeth and Sarah helping their mother
in-doors, to the best of their young ability,
though little Sarah was more inclined for a
romp on the green, than to sew a seam,
polish furniture, or brush up the " house,"
as the large farm kitchen was called.

At the next hirings, the dairy-maid was
dismissed, and the rough lass who did
rubbing and scrubbing, and other odd jobs
in-doors or out, was sent packing twelve
months later ; also on the inspiriting of
Mrs Hales, whose opinion that " there was
no more work than his wife and the girls
could do if they would only bestir themselves,"
was openly quoted in justification
of the measure.

He, however, did not repeat the hint she
had given, that he "could go in and out
when he pleased, and as he pleased, and
do as he liked in his own house, if there
was no one to watch, and listen, and tittletattle
over all the village, if he so much as
took a glass too much, or raised his hand
to any of them."

And so long as he had any sensitiveness
on the score of village gossip, Ralph Birch
did feel the domestic's presence a restraint,
in the matter of raisins his hand both to
his own lips and to other people's ears and
shoulders; but he began to "do as he
liked" pretty speedily when the "tattler"
was trone.

He was not a niggard with his money
any more than of his blows, however much
he might preach economy ; there was no
want or scant on the farm, and he seldom
called his wife to account for the money she
made at market by the sale of her poultry,
butter, and eggs. Indeed she had early
occasion to deplore his thrift ; and the
lavish way in which he would scatter his
coin about when in liquor ; and more than
once remonstrated, in her quiet way, on the
danger of opening his bag of gold at roadside
inns, and then coming home with it in
his pocket, scarcely able to guide or sit a
horse.

He had done so on the occasion to which
Elizabeth alluded, when the horse Mr Ash-vol.

II. N

stead was driving shied at a heap of something
in the road, which closer observation,
and a ray of moonlight, showed to be a
man. When the farmer flung the reins to
his son, and leaped down, he discovered
the man to be Ralph Birch, in a state of
insensibility, the result not of the fall from
his horse, but of his previous potations.
Farmer Ashtead and his son hauled the
senseless heap into their cart with no little
disgust, and drove him to his own home,
where they found the family in consternation
at the return of the horse without his
rider. But their disgust was intensified
when his own sons lifted him from the cart,
to carry him into the house, and he assailed
them with curses and epithets to shock
sober ears, having aroused just sufficiency
to be abusive.

When the Ashteads got to their own
farm there was a pretty tale to tell to the
younger son, Tom, who had been courting
Elizabeth Birch since the days they both
wore pinafores. The tale lost nothing in the
telling, and Tom felt uncomfortably that

the comments thereon were pointed at him.
So, too, when it was supplemented by items
of country gossip from time to time, and
Tom's sisters began to sneer at his sweetheart
as the daughter of such a father. At
first he resented their ill-natured remarks,
but in process of time the friction of the
tongue wore away the edge of his resentment.
He began to feel that it would not
be desirable to have such a father-in-law
as Ralph Birch, and more than once
met Elizabeth in anything but an amiable
frame of mind.

There is no question that he was attached
to her ; but he had not the firmness to resist
the Tribes of his brother — the lighter
shafts of his sisters — and his temper fighting
with his affection, was not improved in
the process.

In some such mood he one day met
Elizabeth, when — being questioned on his
silence and coolness — he gave her pretty
plainly to understand that he was being
persecuted " for her sake, and that he felt
the hardship thereof. Her clear eyes saw

the struggle in his breast, she brought
their afternoon walk to an abrupt termination,
simply requesting him to give her a
meeting at the copse gate the following
Thursday.

They met when the birds were choosing
their mates and twittering on the boughs
among the fresh young verdure of spring ;
and there she told him gravely that it was
best they should part.

Her quietude took him by surprise ; he
did not understand it.

It is clear you do not love me, or you
would not give me up so coolly," he cried,
petulantly.

"It is because I do love you, Tom, that
I give you back your word, I will never
marry any man to bring shame or disgrace
on him. It is clear your family would consider
your connection with mine a disgrace
; and I will never give your sisters the
opportunity to point the finger of scorn at
your wife — because — because of my father.
I cannot avoid being his daughter, but I
can save you from being called his son ! "

He had not counted on this, and strove
though half-heartedly — to shake her resolution
; but she was firm.

Thereupon he took up the tone of one
aggrieved, then shed tears, and they had
at the last parted in anger — on his part at
least.

Elizabeth had maintained her self-command
until he had turned away with an
angry jerk and a sharp —

Then, be it so ; there are plenty of
sweethearts to be found whose fathers
are not flinofinof their fortunes into a beer
barrel ! "

But no sooner had he passed out of sight
than her self-command gave way, and in
agony almost insupportable her head
dropped on the arm already resting on the
gate, though still she shed no tears.

She had felt in honour bound to give
him his freedom, to release him from his
engagement since it brought him annoyance,
and seemed to promise only bitterness
for both. But in her heart of hearts
she must have had a lurking hope that his

love was too deeply rooted to be upton by
the censorious breath of gossip ; that his
sense of justice was too strong to condemn
her for the failings of her father, and that
his better nature would prevail against the
sneers of his family.

She had come prepared to resign him,
to argue the case against herself ; to maintain
her resolve unflinchingly, and do her
duty towards him in spite of herself. But
the ill-concealed satisfaction with which he
took his release, the anger with which he
affected to conceal it, gave her a terrible
shock.

"What have I done to deserve this?"
she said to herself. "He must have ceased
to love me or he could never leave me thus,
without even a parting kiss, or a clasp of the
hand ! It is all those sisters of his, I know.
Well, perhaps it is for the best ! Better
the chancre should come before marriage
than after ; and I have really no right to
blame Tom, since I gave him up of my own
accord. But how could I help it. I could
not keep him bound to me after all his

friends have said. Well, perhaps it is for
the best. I must try to think so, and bear
the separation as bravely as I can. But I
must go away, where I shall neither see
Tom nor father. I may keep my feelings
to myself amongst strangers, and suffer less
than at home, and perhaps father may behave
better to mother when I am gone.
At all events he will not be able to taunt
her with my laziness. And if Tom should
take another sweetheart, I should not have
the pain of seeing it. No, no, I could not
endure that ; I must go away. It is altogether
for the best."

So she communed with herself on her
sad, slow, and solitary walk home that sweet
spring afternoon, when nature and her
heart were so little in accord. And the
scene of violence she witnessed on her return
to the farm only strengthened her
resolution.

She expected opposition on the part of
her father, and several days went by before
she mustered courage to make known her
intention. But he only looked at her

askance, and said, with a half sneer, " Service,
indeed! What's put that into your
head ? Have you and Tom Ashstead
fallen out ? or has the lad found thy temper
out, and turned thee off ? Like enough !
Well, if you're in such a hurry to turn out
of a good home, you'd best be off, and good
quittance to you ! "

Had she a temper ? Yes, if a spirit
which rose against injustice, and was more
ready to defend another than herself might
be called a temper ! She pressed her teeth
and lips together as her father spoke, lest
that " temper " should overmaster her judgment,
and not a word said she in reply.

Out of the kitchen he stalked into the
farmyard, where his eldest son was saddling
a horse for his use. " I say, what's this
fine megrim of Elizabeth's ? Going to
service, she says ! I thought she came to
say she was going to be wed ! Going to
service — ha ! ha ! ha ! A likely lass for service
! Let her try it ! There's been a
split, I reckon, twixt her and Tom."

GoiuCT to service, our Liz — never ! "

was all the comment of Reuben, as he
helped his father to mount, and held the
gate open for him to ride after his drover
and the cattle the man was driving before
him. " He's been drinking already this
morning," muttered the young man, "but
his seat is steady enough now. It won't
be to-night, if he stops at the ' Thirsty
Traveller' on his way home. What was
that he said about Liz ? I say, Jim," to
his brother, in a cowshed near, " have you
heard aught about our Elizabeth and Tom ?
Father says they've fallen out ; and she's
for going to service."

More like she can't stand his o-oinors
on at home," cried Jim, " If it hadn't been
for poor mother, I should have run off and
'listed long ago,"

May be," mused Reuben, " but if I
thought it was Tom — " and into the house
he marched, leaving miry footprints on the
clean red quarries as he went,

I say, Liz, what's this I hear. You
ofoinor to service ? What does Tom think
of it ? "

The colour mounted to her brow, but
she could not trust herself to speak.

Has Tom jilted thee, Liz ? If he
has — " he gripped a muscular fist, and
shook it in the face of an imaginary foe —
If he has, let him look out! I'll give
him such a hiding he shall have sore bones
for the rest of his days ! "

No, no, Reuben, it is not Tom's fault.
It is I who have given him up — I —
I — thought it best. Don't you say a
word to Tom. It really was not Tom's
doing."

She had much ado to convince him that
she had discarded her lover, and that Tom
was not to blame. She had no desire to
make ill-blood between the two friends, and
still less that Tom should be subjected to
hard blows or hard words on her account.

I want to earn my own living, and
escape the contention at home," she at
length admitted ; and though Reuben was
but half satisfied, he was bound to allow
that her reason was sufficient.

But what says mother ? " he asked.

She thinks I am in the right." So
there was no more to be said.

There was, however, more to be done,
if Elizabeth's project was to be carried out.
Her wardrobe had to be overhauled and
adapted, and the advertising coins of the
various papers brought home from Brassington
market by her father had to be
scrutinised and studied.

Many were the servants seeking places,
many the mistresses lacking maids ; but
anxious as was Elizabeth to escape from
the village, where it was already bruited
about that Tom Ashstead had jilted her,
and where she ran the risk of meeting him
at church, or in her errands abroad, anxious
as she was to escape her father's taunts, her
brother's questioning glances, she was not
sufficiently dependent or reckless to take a
situation at random.

Once or twice she saw that which seemed
promising, but her letters were unnoticed,
or the advertisers required young women
who had already been in service, and who
could furnish credentials from former mistresses.

She began to think the search
for a situation a more tedious task than
she had dreamed. She was on the point
of going over to a register office in Brassington,
when her eye was attracted by the
following in the Brassington Gazette : —

Attracted, for a small family, a res
spectacle young Woman as domestic
Servant, where another is kept ; plain cooking
required ; washing put out ; work light ;
wages liberal. — Reply by letter to C. P.,
Laburnum Villa, West Lane.

This seemed promising. Elizabeth
showed the advertisement to her mother.

"Well, my dear," said she, with a sigh,
if you must leave home for servitude, I
think you cannot do better than answer
that. It seems the very place for you.
The advertiser must be respectable ; and
if the family be small, a second servant
must make the work light, and be a companion
for you at the same time."

So Elizabeth wrote, and in due time
came a reply : —

Mrs Price is satisfied with the statement
of Elizabeth Birch's qualifications,
and the testimony of the clergyman's lady,
but, before making a decision, would be
glad to see the young woman. Will be at
liberty on Wednesday, from 2 to 4 p.m. If
her mother bore her company, it might be
more satisfactory, Elizabeth Birch not having
been in service previously,"

Elizabeth was ironing when the letter
came. She took her time ; finished the
garment she was smoothing ; hung it on
the clothes-horse to air ; placed the cool
iron with its fellows in front of the fire to
get hot, and then went into the dairy to her
mother.

"What do you think of that i^ " she
asked, laying the letter before her.

Mrs Birch was weighing butter ready
for the mould. Laying down her knife,
she took up the letter, but with a trembling
hand — this going away of her girl would bea
sore trial to her. A tear gathered in her
eye as she said, —

I think the lady is very cautious. Perhaps
she wishes to be sure we are respectable.
Yes; I will go with you, Elizabeth."

What's that ? " cried Sarah, as she came
into the dairy with a frothing pail of new
milk. " Price — oh ! is that the name ?
You don't seem to rejoice over it, Elizabeth.
I only wish the chance was mine."

I do not see any sufficient cause for
rejoicing as yet," was Elizabeth's answer.
Mrs Price says nothing decided ; and I
think it is somewhat inconsiderate to ask
my mother to leave her own work, and
travel fourteen miles and back, as well as
myself, for her inspection. It is, of course,
requisite that she should see me ; but I
think mother might have been spared both
the cost and trouble of a fatiguing and unnecessary
journey. If I desire to go into
service, there is no reason mother should
be put to inconvenience, or be annoyed by
strangers. I feel tempted to decline."

Nay, my dear," said Mrs Birch, " it is
a very important step you are taking, and
I should myself like to see what sort of a

person this Mrs Price is before you engage
with her, since you are set on leaving
home. She may have no knowledge of
farm life, or any idea that I must neglect
duties here to accompany you. We can
go in the spring-cart. It will be better
than walking to Broomwood to meet the
coach. We can go tomorrow, and be
back before your father gets home."

It was a long drive for Mrs Birch, who
seldom stirred beyond the farm, except to
church or the Broomwood market, three
miles away. Elizabeth had taken the
reins. Horse and cart were left at the
Black Boy," when they reached the busy
town. They had then a stiff walk before
them, past the old church, across the marketplace,
from which a narrow and crowded
street of shops led to a wide open thoroughfare,
ascending, still ascending, until, more
than a mile beyond, the shops disappeared,
the remains of a fine old park appeared
on the left, and the houses on the right
interposed a wall of evergreens between
pedestrians and their lower windows. As

they ascended, still ascended, the road
branched off. West Lane opening out to
the left a vista of small villa residences
embowered among trees, in the freshest
green of spring. Lilac and hawthorn
scented the air ; laburnums shook their
golden tresses overhead ; the noise and
smoke of the manufacturing town were
left behind, they had risen to a purer
atmosphere, when they rang the bell at
Laburnum Villa, and were asked by a neat
serving-maid to step into the front room.

They had ample time to note the glitter
of glass and gilding ; of polished walnut-wood
and bright steel ; the colour and
devices of upholstery and carpeting, when
Mrs Price sailed in, with a train of silk
behind her, and bade them to be re-seated
on the sofa, whence they had risen, and
where the light from two windows fell
upon them, whilst she, in an easy chair,
confronted them, herself in the shade.

She was, by turns, all affability and
all stiffness. Put a number of questions,
some of them irrelevant ; expressed herself

satisfied with their replies ; announced
her objection to give more than ten pounds
a-year to a new hand ; her liberal advance
if Elizabeth suited and remained with them.
Mr Price was from home all day, so work
was light ; washing went out ; the maids
between them merely " rubbed out " a few
dusters and their own clothes. Pastry, and
all special cooking, passed through her
own hands. They kept little company
and early hours, gave the usual holidays,
but allowed no followers ; for that reason
preferred a girl from the country. The
maid she had then came from the country,
and was very respectable.

All this sounded well. Mrs Price and
Mrs Birch appeared mutually satisfied ; and
if Elizabeth had any doubts, she did not
express them. It was settled that she
should enter the place the following
Monday. And then Mrs Birch and her
daughter returned to the inn, where the
cart awaited them, tired and hungry after
their lone walk. Mrs Price had not
thought it necessary to offer any refresh-vol.

II. o

ment, although conscious they must have
been hours upon the road.

Though within sight of the village, Birch
Farm lay among fields, and was approached
by a narrow lane between high hedges of
thorn and bramble.

There were gates for the cattle to leave
the pasturage ; stiles for bipeds — the said
stiles in that part of the world being merely
a succession of horizontal bars between upright
posts, excessively inconvenient for
petticoats. Skirting the main road, a
patch of copse-wood ran two-thirds the
length of the pasturage, a low wooden
gate with a hasp, and a railed fence alone
keeping out intruders. This gate opened
from the pasturage, and although in proximity
to the stile, was hidden from the
lane by the height and closeness of the
picturesque hedge.

It was not the nearest way from church,
but Elizabeth had been wont to choose
it, possibly because there was a someone
ready to hand her over the stile.

That last Sunday, at church or home,

she took the wonted path — took it alone
partly from habit, partly from a melancholy
desire to say farewell to a hallowed
spot — the birthplace and the burial-place
of her young love.

Tom had not been at church. She
fancied he had heard she was going away,
and could not face her. She had mounted
the high stile, and was poising herself to
cross the top bar, when her eye caught
the figure of Tom Ashtead waiting behind
the copse-gate. She lost her balance, her
dress caught, and she fell. Thanks to
Tom's promptitude, and the strength of
her dress, he caught her before she
reached the trodden ground, and she
escaped with a rent skirt and a severe
shaking. Her heart fluttered ; her colour
came and went ; her limbs trembled, and
refused to uphold her ; but she set it down
to the fall, and said she should soon be
better.

When she disengaged herself from his
arm, she had to cling to the little gate-post
for support, unable to move a step.

Bessyy and Others.

He came, Tom said, to say goodbye
to her, if she was going, as he had
heard, and to wish her well, and to say he
honoured her for her decision ; that whereever
she was, his heart would go with her;
and he hoped she would, at least, shake
hands with him, and part friends.

Without a word, for speech was impossible,
she put forth her hand. He took it,
and, more, he caught her in his arms ; held
her in a close embrace ; pressed a long kiss
upon her lips ; released her — and was

gone

FIRST SERVICE.

HY, Lizzy, how you have torn
the skirt of your dress ! And
that beautiful lilac mush, too !
However did you contrive to
doit?"

So saying, Sarah, who had walked
straight home from church with Reuben,
and already had her Sunday gown tucked
up and an apron before her, held out her
sister's dilapidated skirt to its full width,
as if to show the extent of the damage.

I slipped as I was getting over the
stile," answered Elizabeth, as composedly
as she could ; but there was something in

her voice which caused Sarah to look
sharply up in her face for the flush she
knew to be there.

This was in the back kitchen, and before
she could drop the expanded skirt, or utter
more than an ejaculatory " Oh-h ! " the
father came on the scene behind her.

Well ; thought in a nice pickle ! A
pretty mess for a decent girl just come
home from church ! Where's tha been } "

And he took her by the shoulder and
shook her roughly.

I fell over the stile and tore it," she
answered, with quiet firmness ; all her
strength of will having come to her
aid.

Fell over th' stile, indeed ! " he echoed,
with a scornful sneer. " When didst fall
o'er th' stile afore, I'd like to know, and be
handed to thee ? Thou looks as if shouldst
been draQfa^ed through a thorn bush. I
reckon this comes o' meeting Tom Birch
in th' copse ! And look at thy cape ! It's
well thought going away, or thou'd have all
Kitknoll talking of thee. An' who's to

buy thee fine clothes to be torn to rags, I'd
Hke to know ? "

There was an expansion of the girl's
nostrils, a firm compression of lips and
teeth before she answered, coldly, —

I am oroinsf where fine clothes will be
out of place, and where I shall earn my
own."

It's time thou did'st ! " he bawled after
her. " And see you don't go larking with
lads in thy new place, or you'll not keep
it long."

Sarah had disappeared at the first sound
of her father's voice. She had whispered
to her mother what was the matter, and
finished laying the cloth with signs on her
own face of a desire to tackle her father in
his own style. Leaving her mother to
dish up the dinner, she followed Elizabeth
upstairs, and said as much to her, running
off at a tangent to add, —

What did you mean by not wanting
fine clothes where you were going ? and
what shall you do with the one you are
taking off, and your other muslins ? "

I mean that they are unfit for a servant.
I could not use my mistress's time and
starch to get them up, if I could wear them.
I'll leave them behind for you."

For me ! Oh, Lizzy, that is good of
you ! But surely you don't mean to dress
like a Quaker or a charity girl when you
are in service ? "

And Sarah looked as if the prospect was
doleful.

Certainly not ; I can be plain and
respectable without being either prim or
outlandish."

Sarah did not see it ; she broke out on
another tack.

I say, wasn't father cruel ? But did
you meet Tom ? "

Yes ; it was through the surprise of
seeing him that I fell. Tom caught me.
Hark ! father's calling. We must not
keep him waiting."

And she hurried her sister off, fastening
her own changed dress as she followed
down the stairs, her conflict of feeling kept
well out of sight. If that unexpected

meeting with Tom and his parting embrace
had unnerved her for the time, there
could be no doubt that it had given her
strength and consolation ; but it did not
change her purpose.

To say that Reuben was up betimes
would be to state that which was a fact all
the year round. But he was up earlier
than usual, and Jim was up with him to
get the cattle into the pasture, and the
cows milked before the girls were astir.

You know, lad," he had said to sleepy
Jim, " it wont be fair to expect Elizabeth
to sit down and milk before she starts ;
and I want to have the horse harnessed,
and the cart out, and her box in it — ay,
and to drive her off before father's about,
or he may turn crusty and not let us have
the horse and cart. And, besides, Jim,
there'll be one hand short on the farm now;
we shall have to be up with the lark if we
would keep things right and straight.
Father's not much good now."

No ; more's the pity. I've a notion
he was at the 'Thirsty Travellers' last night,

from the look of the house-place this morning.
You may drive to Broomwood and
back before he's up, if you're sharp."

And so Reuben did, and had the horse
rubbed down before his father was up and
about. And the only remark the latter
made, as he looked round, when he did
put in an appearance, was — " Well, I
reckon she's off! An' thou's no need to
spill any eyewater over it. It's her own
seeking, and there's one less in the way
here. Where's the brandy ? I'm all in a
shake with the cold. Stir thee ! "

The red-eyed wife he addressed, not
daring to refuse the evil spirit which had
robbed him of his vital heat and put him
in a tremor, obeyed in timorous haste.

I'm glad Elizabeth got off so quietly,"
remarked the mother, with a sigh, to Sarah,
when he had "pulled himself together"
and was gone.

It was premature gladness, so far as
those at home were concerned ; for Mrs
Hales, happening to open the shutters at the
Thirsty Travellers " as they passed, saw

Reuben driving his sister and her box
towards Broomwood in the spring-cart,
and did not fail to make the most of her
observation when Ralph Birch stopped
his horse at the door the next morning on
his way to Broomwood, and called for a
stiff glass to " help a fellow to market and
keep off the chills."

She was not the best of aunts by any
means ; was one to shun rather than to
seek, and she knew it ; but she professed
to consider herself slighted and achieved
at their passing the door without so much
as a " How d'ye do ? " or a " Good-bye ! "

There was a second call at the inn on
Ralph's way home, and there was a scene
when he got there ; Reuben, wakened out
of his sleep, having to rush downstairs,
barefooted and coates, to protect his
mother from the violence of the infuriated
father, and wrest his horsewhip from him.

Nothing knew Elizabeth of this. She
was too early for the coach, and Reuben
could not stay with her. A shake of the
hand — a brotherly kiss — a " God be with

you ; " — the cart was speeding back again,
and she, seated on her box, with a composed
face, waited the coming of the coach,
which was to whirl her away from all she
knew and all she loved.

I must look forward, and not back.
It is my own act, and it is all for the best,"
she thought to herself, as she set her teeth
resolutely together, and choked emotion
down.

The journey that fresh spring morning
through village streets, where half-dressed
children stood at cottage doors to watch
them pass, along highways bordered with
verdure and hedgerows full of bloom and
melody, under over-arching boughs touched
with the tender green of opening leaves,
with the perfume of hawthorn and lilac,
and less obtrusive florets floating in the
air, must have been delightful had she not
lived in the country all her life, and had
her mind filled with other things.

She smelled the town before she reached
it ; and, if anything, Brassington looked
more dingy on the second visit than on the

first. But once set down at the " Black
Boy," and thrown on her own resources,
she had to think and act for herself. There
was no hiring a man to carry a box so far,
had she felt disposed to walk. An ostler,
for a fee, undertook to procure a cab, and
told her the honest fare.

Calm as she looked when her box was
put down at Laburnum Villa, her heart
beat rapidly. The neat maid she had seen
before opened the door for her, helped her
to lift the box on to the mat into the passage,
with a caution not to graze the paint
or rest it on the oilcloth, tapped at the
door of a back room, and announced, —

The new servant, i'm."

A voice said stiffly, "Tell Elizabeth
Birch to come here ; " and her servitude
had begun.

Mrs Price, in a much-refilled morning
dress, sat on a rocking-chair, with a child
about six months old upon her lap. This
was the first intimation to Elizabeth that
children were included in the small family,
and she said so.

I was not aware there was a child,
madam, when I engaged," she observed,
respectfully.

Perhaps not. As you will have nothing
to do with them or the nursery, I did not
think it worth mentioning," was the complacent
reply.

Elizabeth wondered how many children
the "them" represented. She only
drew in her breath and faintly murmured,
"Oh!"

With the exception of the nursery,
which is the nurse's department, and the
dusting of the drawing-room ornaments
(with which I never allow a servant to
meddle), you will have the entire housework
in your charge, and the meals ; but
we have only very plain cookery, and anything
extra I superintend myself."

Elizabeth began to wonder if she had
not unwittingly undertaken more than she
could accomplish.

The lady went on, —

We keep very little company ; but,
at all times, I require everything done

J

with extreme nicety, for I am very
particular."

I thought, madam, there was a second
servant kept ? " put in Elizabeth at length.
Oh, yes ; but Ann is the 7iurse-vci2iA ;
she only assists to get through the little
washing done at home. And now you
may go. Ann will help you to carry your
box to your room, and show you where
everything for your use is kept. Stay —
you are an early riser, I understand ; so
much the better. This room, and the hall,
and steps must be done up thoroughly
before breakfast ; and, as Mr Price goes to
business, breakfast must be on the table
precisely at eight o'clock."

Very well, ma'am ; " and she again
essayed to go. She was again recalled.

By-the-bye — your name ; it is too long
for a domestic ; we shall shorten it to
Bessyy."

Mrs Price stretched out her hand to the
bell ; the door opened.

Ann, help Bessyy to carry her box upstairs,
and then come back for baby."

And Bessyy followed Ann, not quite sure
whether she was herself or someone else.
However, she determined to do her best,
and see what would come of it.

It was a long haul upstairs of the heavy
box to the attic where Elizabeth, or
Bessyy," was to sleep ; but barely had the
girls set it down and paused to take breath
than the ting-tang of the bell resounded
through the house.

Oh, dear, there's missis ringing. I
must be off for that baby. You can find
your way to the kitchen, I daresay ; it's at
the back."

And good-natured Ann stopped at the
door.

I daresay you are hungry ?"

Yes ; I have had nothing since breakfast
at half-past five."

And I suppose missis never asked you
if you wanted anything ? "

Bessyy shook her head.

Just like her. I shall ask for you."

There was a fall and a scream from the
room below.

Good gracious ! what are them three
little pickles up to now ? " cried Ann, as
she was off downstairs with a rush ; and
Bessyy was left behind to reflect on the
rapid multiplication of the " >s"w<3;// family,"
and on the " three little pickles " roaring
and stamping in the nursery beneath. She
had not been used to children. Many
years had gone by since Sarah had been a
child, and then she was but a child herself;
and now she was more than eighteen, and
Sarah close upon seventeen. She felt
that she had been wilfully misled, and wondered
how she should ore on with them if
they were rude ; but her determination todo
her duty was unshaken.

She looked out of the dormer window on
a longer suburban garden than ordinary,
and on fniit trees which must have been
there before the villa was built.

I'm glad there is a garden, and a
promise of plenty of fruit; and the 'little
pickles' can scarcely make such a disturbance
as father."

And so thinking, having washed her face

VOL. II. p

and smoothed her banded hair, she put on
a clean apron and went downstairs, as
comely, neat, and modest - looking ' a
servant-maid as one would wish to see ;
well-disposed to make the best of everything.


The hubbub upstairs had subsided. Mrs
Price was in the kitchen, with a small plate
in her hand. She stopped on her way to
the pantry, eyed Bessyy from top to toe,
and then asked, in a tone of anything but
satisfaction, —

Have you no caps ? "

Caps ? No," faltered Bessyy, wondering
what there was criminal in the want
of a cap. " I did not know they were
necessary, ma'am ; only the old women
wear caps at Kitknoll."

Every respectable servant-maid sears
a cap in Brassington," said Mrs Price, with
posted emphasis. " I cannot permit a
servant of mite to be seen without one.
You cannot possibly go to the door without
a cap. You might be taken for a
friend of the family ! "

"Would that be such an enormity?"
thought Bessyy.

Perhaps Ann will lend you one of hers
for to-day," her mistress went on ; " in the
evening, when the children are all in
bed, she can take you to a shop where such
things are sold."

Very well, ma'am."

The lady disappeared into the pantry,
an offshoot of the kitchen, and laid on the
deal table the blue plate, on which lay quite
an inoffensive piece of cheese.

I am told you breakfasted early ; you
can have that for your luncheon ; there is
bread in the pantry, and I will draw you
a glass of table-beer ; though I do not
usually allow luncheon, as we dine at one
o'clock."

I do not drink beer," said Bessyy
gravely.

Mrs Price lifted her eyebrows, looked at
her, put the brass tap-key back in her
pocket, with a composed, " So much the
better;" but whether she meant for the girl's
health or her own pocket is not very clear.

There was to be cold meat for dinner ;
she would find potatoes in a basket in the
brewhoLise, where they must be peeled,
and where she would find sauce-pans. Ann
would be down presently, and could show
her where other things were kept.

And presently Ann did come down, with
the baby in her arms, and three boys at her
heels, the eldest scarcely six. They came
crowding round the new maid, at first to
stare, then to question, and, as she left the
brew house with the saucepan of potatoes
in her hand, followed pell-mell, struggling
which should be foremost ; heedless of
Ann's remonstrance, and in the struggle to
escape from her grasp, Augustus pushed
against Damian, and Damian upset
Reginald, who fell right in front of Bessyy
on the hearth, clutching at her dress, and
causing her to stumble, and shake a quantity
of the cold water out over the bright fender,
the hearthstone, and Master Regy's blue
frock.

Ann plucked the child away with her
disengaged hand. He set up a roar.

If I don't tell mamma the new servant's
gone and knocked Regy down, first
thing! Oh! and spilled all the water on
Regy's new frock and the fender," cried
six years' Augustus, lifting up his hands,
and setting off at a run.

You little villain, you'd best not," interposed
Ann, dragging him back with a shake ;
'you did it. Hush, Regy ; you're not hurt."

By this time mamma was on the scene.
One said one thing — one another. Bessyy
held her tongue ; had she broken silence,
she might have lost her temper. Regy
had bruised his forehead, his frock was wet,
so were fender and hearth, and Bessyy was
silent, — all conclusive evidence to Mrs Price.

Facts are stubborn things," said she,
pointing to these, ignoring the fact that
Bessyy's apron hung from one string, and
her skirt from the gathers. " You will
have to be more careful and good-tempered
with the children, young woman, if you
are to remain here," and having said this,
with pointed severity, to Bessyy, she took
the whimpering little one by the hand,

saying, coaxingly, " Come with me, Regy
dear, and have a cake to make him
well."

There, I told you," chuckled Augustus,
as he, too, ran off to beg a cake, with
Damian after him.

Are they always so boisterous ? " asked
Bessyy, as she pinned up her apron and
torn skirt, and Ann hushed the disturbed
baby in her arms.

"We — 11, not akuays ;" and the emphasis
was eloquent.

Between housewifely instinct, and the
opening of this cupboard and that drawer
by Ann, to reveal where this thing or that
was placed, Bessyy had collected the table
equipments on a tray, and was at the oven
testing the progress of a rice pudding,
when a passing figure darkened the window,
and Ann exclaimed, —

Why, if here isn't Clara home from
school."

Another," thought Bessyy ; " where is
the small family to end ? "

It did not end with the miss who burst

in at the kitchen door, and flung down her
books with the exclamation, —

Dinner not ready ? Oh dear, and I
shall be kept waiting ! "

She did not wait long. She and Master
Augustus dined in state with their mamma,
the younger ones in the nursery. Before
the cold meat was removed, Mrs Price
rang for two plates. On these she laid,
with nice calculation, the thin slices of
beef designed for the domestics. Bessyy
took it without comment ; but she thought,
It's well I've a small appetite ; what
would Sarah do with such a dinner } " And
she could not help saying to the nursemaid,
— " Will that be sufficient for you ? "

I suppose I must make it do, and fill
up with potatoes. I've been in places
where one hadn't a chance of even doing
that; so I've learned to take what I get
here and be thankful. And I've been
where they give you only the leavings in
the pot for tea ; but Mrs Price does give
you a spoonful of tea for yourself; so it's
not the worst place in the world."

To Bessyy, accustomed to the abundance
of the farm, this was a new aspect of
service, and not a pleasant one ; but she
had left home resolved to make light of
difficulties, and was not to be daunted.

Her initiation was not over. At nine
o'clock, the last instalment of the " small
family " let himself in at the front door
with a latch-key, and in a few moments
the bell rang, and Bessyy was summoned
into the parlour for Mr Price's inspection
and approval. He was a short, fussy man,
with sandy hair and whiskers, and stood
on the hearth rug with his legs apart, his
hands under his coat tails, and his back
to the grate, where a fire was not.

Oh! so this is Bessyy Birch, is she ?"
and he smiled and nodded, as if to signify
that her appearance was satisfactory. " I
hope that you left all well at home, Bessyy ;
and that you have no sweethearts or followers.
We are very particular, Bessyy,
and could not allow anything of that kind.
Very particular. And, Bessyy, I must have
my shaving-water precisely at twenty

minutes past seven, to a second ; so don't
forget. And breakfast on the table — eo-o^s
boiled, bacon frizzled — at eight to a minute,
or I shall miss my omnibus. You understand
— to a viimtte. I am very particular''

Bessyy curtsied her acquiescence, and
was allowed to depart. But at ten, when
she was removing the supper things, Mrs
Price said, " You had better go to bed in
half-an-hour, as you will have to be up at
four for the washing ; Ann also."

She laid her head on her pillow in a sort
of whirl. In twelve hours she had discovered
the fallacy of trusting an advertisement.
Her first day of service was not
promising.

"A small family" — five obstreperous
children; the "other servant" — a nursemaid
to keep them in order ; " washing
put out" — an order to be at the wash-tub
by four in the morning. What fresh discoveries
might she not make in twelvemonths
? Then the scrutiny and observations
of Mr Price had roused a spirit of
rebellion in her breast, which took her

quite an hour to quell. But she only grew
the more determined to pursue the path
she had chosen, and to do her duty in it.
Perhaps some pride mingled with this
resolve ; a pride that would not confess
itself mistaken. And be sure, Tom, and
the folk at home were not absent from her
kaleidoscope, but helped to drive away
sleep until close upon midnight.

From four until twenty minutes past
seven Ann stood at the wash-tub with her,
and entertained her with items of her own
history and of those with Vv^hom she had
lived ; and certainly she took the bloom
off Elizabeth Birch's peach. But when
the shaving-water went up to her master,
she had to prepare to bathe and dress five
children for their breakfast at half-past eight.

Bessyy, too, had her kitchen to sweep,
the room and breakfast to prepare, her
own hurried meal to take, things to clear
away, beds to make, and, though Mrs
Price professed to lend a hand in dusting
and other little matters because it was
washing day, when Bessyy got back into

the wash-house (there called a brew-house)
the water in use was cold, and had she not
previously popped in from time to time
to keep the furnace alight, she might have
had none to renew it. In the course of
the morning a laundress came " for the
washing" — the master's linen, the lady's
and baby's muslins ; but, although these
were put out, Bessyy found that washing fora
"very particular" family, in which were
five children, was no trifle, and when she
sat down to her tea her arms ached with
pounding at the aiding-tub, rubbing, and
wrinorincr.

But she was not afraid of work, and was
not inclined to give in, though she could
not forget that she had been deceived, and
she was wise enough to feel that activity
was an antidote to melancholy. She had
her hours of bitterness, into which none
might enter ; but she battled right valiantly
with her own weakness, and no one there
was the wiser. And so the weeks and the
months went by ; she had brought her
work under by system and routine ; was

ready at times to lend a helping hand to
flurried Ann, when the fractiousness of one
or other of the children made it almost
impossible to dress them for a walk.
Strangely enough, she had acquired an
influence over the turbulent youngsters,
neither possessed by the mother nor by
Ann, At the very first she saw that she
must be firm and decided with them, and
permit no wild invasions of her territory,
or there would be neither rest nor possibility
of pursuing her work satisfactorily.
Yet she was anything but unkind to them,
she was simply staid and equable, her 3'ea
was yea, and her nay was nay.

More than three weeks elapsed before
she wrote home, and then she said nothing
of her mistress's niggardliness, or her
master's fussiness, or the children's rudeness
; she merely said there was a larger
family and more work than she had anticipated,
but that the work was good for her,
and she had found avery sensible companion
in the nurse-maid, and was not so lonely as
might have been expected.

It was answered, not by her mother, but
by Reuben, and that not on paper, but in
person.

He had come to Brassing^ton market
instead of his father, who had been thrown
off his horse as he was mounting at the
door of " The Thirsty Travellers," and lay
there unfit to be moved, or so their Aunt
Hailes said. And it came out that Reuben
had " pitched into Tom Ashstead " for
spreading discreditable reports over the
village about the last meeting they had in
the copse, when her dress was torn, and
that Tom and he had a " regular stand-up
fiofht," and Tom got the worst of it. And
it turned out that it was her Aunt Hailes,
after all, who had set the infamous slander
afloat, and she could only have got the
lying foundation from his father. He had
ferreted it out ; but not before it had made
ill blood between him and Tom. However,
he didn't much mind, for he thought
Tom richly deserved a good hiding for
sneaking out of his enofacrement to her,
after courting: so long;.

Reuben had not stayed more than half-an-hour,
but no sooner had he gone, thana
sharp ring of the parlour bell summoned
Bessyy into the presence of Mrs Price.

Who was that ? " demanded she, with
stiff asperity.

My eldest brother, ma'am."

Did I not say that I allowed no followers
? I may overlook it this time, but
remember it for the future. I am very
particular. No followers."

In the heartache Reuben had left behind,
in the consciousness that her good
name had been aspersed by those who
should have been her shield, she hardly
felt the minor reproof of her mistress ; but
she did feel, and sorely, the added insinuation
of her master, when he came home
at night, that he might be her brother
and he might not, but that it would not do
for them to have strange men about the
place ; not that they doubted her propriety
or the young man's honesty ; but it did not
do, and they could not tolerate followers.

It was at her tongue's end to give her

fussy master warning there and then, but
Bessyy seldom acted upon impulse ; she set
her teeth in front of the rebellious tongue,
and came to the conclusion she could only
live down slander by keeping in the place
she had entered.

"Is that girl sullen, or what?" asked
Mr Price of his better half, before she was
fairly out of the room. " The silence in
which she receives reproof is something
incomprehensible."

Sullen, I should say," was the verdict
of the lady, who elevated her shoulders and
curled her lip, as she came to that conclusion.
" She scarcely condescended to
reply to me when I spoke to her."

Nevertheless Mrs Price found that the
domestic wheels moved more smoothly
with her reticent maid than had previously
been the case, and though she felt it her
duty to be particular, and to have rooms
re-swept and dusted if they were not done
to her satisfaction, and Bessyy's silent obedience
was disconcerting, still it was obedience,
and she had the scolding to herself

She had the fruit also to herself when
it ripened. It was made into pies and
preserves, given to the children, placed on
the table for dessert on the Sunday when
Mr Price was at home, but not shared
with the domestics ; and Ann gave Bessyy
a hint that the very gooseberries and
currants were counted on the trees.
Apples and pears were stowed away, and
where absolutely allowed to rot in the storeroom,
but never a one found its way to a
servant, except as a small fraction of a
tart.

To Bessyy, who had gathered and eaten
fruit at will, this niofaardliness was something
shocking. She was, however, both
too proud and too honest to stretch her
hand to that which was forbidden.

Mistress has certainly a right to do
what she likes with her own," she remarked
to Ann one day, when she had
been sent with a large basket of decayed
fruit to the mixed, " but it is a sin and a
shame to let God's good gifts go to waste
and destruction for want of using."

"So it is," said Ann, "but I am not so
sure they are her own, any more than the
talent the man hid in a napkin. But don't
you mean to sit down and finish your
dinner ? You eat nothing ; and it will be
quite cold."

My dinner was finished for me when I
was called from it into the store-room, to
wait whilst a peck or two of rotten apples
were picked out and thrown into the
clothes-basket, to be carried out of doors.
When mistress does not cut off our meat
until she has finished her own dinner,
ours cannot be very warm to begin with ;
and, after being so called off, / cannot go
back to the uneatable slice of chilled
mutton."

Ah, Bessyy, you are more nice than
wise ; if you had been in service as long
as me — "

But I have not,' interrupted Bessyy ;
I have been accustomed to warm and
comfortable meals, and time to eat them
in without jumping up every few minutes.
However, if that is a condition of service,

VOL. II. Q

I must e'en make the best of it ; there are
worse things than spoiled dinners," and,
with a heavy sigh, she collected her plates
and dishes for washing.

It will be seen that Bessyy was gathering
her impressions of service under anything
lout favourable auspices ; Ann's precedents
were not rose-leaved or rose-tinted, and
the former had early discovered that Mrs
Price was one of those who would exact
everything, but render nothing in return
beyond the bare pound of flesh compulsory)—
one not likely to bind her domestics
in any bonds but those of hire. With the
approach of winter she learned a little
more of Mrs Price's consideration for
"those of her own household," and had,
besides, an unpleasant surprise in a letter
from Birch Farm.

HE letter which gave Bessyy such
an unpleasant surprise was from
Sarah, expressing her intention
to follow her sister's lead and
go into service.

I'm not going to stay here and work
from morning to night, and never have a
day to one's self to go pleasuring, like other
girls" (so the letter ran), " or to have Reu-

VOL. III. A

ben or Jim after me if I don't get home to
the minute. The house isn't like the same
since you went, what with father's goings
on, and Reuben ordering about as if he
was master. And mother has grown so
cross and so strict, one might as well be
in a nunnery ; and I'm not going to stand
it. She says I waste too much time before
the looking-alass, and think too much of
setting myself off; and if I look at any of
the lads in church it's a crime. It isn't my
fault that Jack Miles or Sam Perks wants
to walk home with me, and hang about our
lane ; or that the young squire has spoken
to me and called me a pretty lass ; yet
there's been such a hubbub about it as
never was ; and I just believe Aunt Hales
is at the bottom of it. Father threatened
to horsewhip me, but he'd best not try it.
As for Reuben, he's so set upon having
Emma White in the house to help mother,
that I can do nothing to please him. But
if she comes here with her quiet, sneaking
ways, I shall leave, whether they like it or
not. Jim told me last night that Tom

Ashtead had been asking after yon, and
wanted to know where you were living,
but he hadn't a mind to tell him, the whole
lot of them were getting so uppish since
they had that bit of money left them by
their grandfather's sister. And I asked
Jim how he came across Tom Ashtead,
for he never shows his face here, but Jim
put me off. It's in my mind that Jim's
hankering after their Matty — like a great
donkey — for she just turns up her nose at
him and all of us, as if we was not fit to
wipe her shoes. Mother sends her love,
and hopes you are comfortable. There's
father coming up the lane hooting and
swearing, so no more at present from your
affectionate sister, Sarah Birch.

PS. — Be sure and let me know if you
hear of a nice place, for I'm sure I shan't
stay here to be badgered. And don't be
surprised if I was to drop on you suddenly
some day."

Bessyy folded up her letter and put it in
her pocket, looking very grave indeed.

She knew sufficient of both her mother
and sister to feel assured that the former
was not cross without a cause, if cross at
all ; and the whole tone of the letter indicated
that Sarah herself was giving her
family cause for uneasiness. " Reuben
and Jem would not leave the farm to look
after her for nothing," thought Bessyy, as
she went about her morning's work quieter
than usual. " It will be a good thing for
mother if Emma White does come to help
her ; she's a steady, good girl, and she can
be well spared from her own home. Father
would surely behave better before her. But
I hope Sarah won't come here. Mrs Price
would be displeased. It might do Sarah
no harm to go to service for awhile. She
would have less her own way than she
thinks, and the lesson might do her good."
She, however, wrote home to her sister
that very night to give her a word or two
of counsel, and advise her to stay at home
and obey her mother, saying that strangers
would be much more strict than anyone
at home, and that she might thank her

brothers for looking after her instead of
showing temper. As for the young squire,
she cautioned her to keep out of his way ;
his notice was not to a young woman's
credit. And she added that Mrs Price
did not permit her servants to have visitors,
and she did not know anywhere she
could possibly meet her unless at the shop
of the confectioner Mrs Price dealt with.

She did not trust herself to say a word
about Tom, not having much faith in her
sister's discretion. Indeed, the more she
reflected, the more was she convinced that
for her own peace of mind, and his too, it
was best she preserved silence. "If they
have grown richer, and we are being
dragged down in the world, the Ashteads
are not likely to be better inclined towards
me ; and if Tom thought more of his family
than of me when we were more on a level,
it's not likely he has changed by this time.
But if he has, I'm not going into any family
on sufferance, or to be a disgrace to it.
And neither Matty nor Aunt Hales shall
have a chance of saying I'm seeking Tom

or sending messages to him. We've parted
and there's an end of it."

It was all very well for her to tell herself
there was an end of it," and she " would
not think about him ; " the wonder why he
wanted to know where she lived would
obtrude in the very midst of her work, and
of that, fortunately for her, there was more
than usual.

There was a thorough turn-out — a repetition
of the autumn cleaning — before
Christmas. Undreamed of stores of glass,
and china and plate, were brought out to
be washed and polished ; furniture paste
and friction were in demand for chairs and
tables, oil and rotten stone for the fire-irons,
blockhead and brush for the grates, and Mrs
Price's " very particular" rang in Bessyy's
ears from morning until night.

The said lady had a pet theory respecting
the last item of housework, insisting
that Bessyy did not use sufficient blockhead ;
she was not using half as much as her predecessors
; she could not bring her stoves to
a polish without it, and so on, and so on.

Bessyy had found the moulded ironwork
of the grates clogged and caked, and had
done her best to remedy the ill ; but the
clever housewife regarded the unused
packets of powder as evidence of laziness,
not economy, and insisted on its use.

Very well, ma'am," said Bessyy composedly
; and at the end of the week the
blockhead had disappeared.

Ah," said Mrs Price triumphantly ;
look at that grate ! That's something
like a polish ! I knew you were trying to
save your labour, not the blockhead. As if
I did not know how a grate should be
polished. And I told you before how very
particular I was."

There was a faint intimation of a smile
on Bessyy's face as she carried off her pot
and brushes, conscious that not an atom of
fresh blockhead had gone on the grate that
morning, a brisk dry brushing having been
the charm under which it had brightened.

And see you put plenty of soda in the
water before you clean the paint," had
been the "particular" injunction.

It would serve her right if I did,"
murmured Bessyy to herself; "but the
paint is the landlord's, and I should feel
as if I was robbing him, if I washed the
paint away with soda ; I can take the dirt
off without it."

And she did, and Mrs Price rejoiced in
the efficacy of her instruction.

So much cleaning, as Ann foretold,
heralded company ; not merely a family
gathering on Christmas Day, but a dance,
for which a carpet had to be removed and
rolled up ; and after this came card and
supper parties at intervals. And for all
these there was extra cookery, extra preparations,
although most of the confectionery
came from Mrs Amoryy's, at the
foot of the hill. But no one was hired to
wash dishes, or wait at table ; and although
Mrs Price would reach napery, china, glass,
plate, and stores from the closets, and
assisted to arrange the collation on the
night of the dance, Ann could render little
assistance unless Miss Clara was in a good
humour and could be coaxed into taking

charge of the nursery for half-an-hour ; but
there was so much dressing-up of the
juveniles for show on these occasions, and
so Httle chance of getting them quietly to
bed, that Ann could not be counted on
until a late hour.

It was a new experience for Bessyy, and
sent her thoughts back to Mrs Price's
advertisement, and its promise, '' Work
light," when she began at six in a morning
and was scarcely allowed to sit down until
the last visitor departed at one, two, or
sometimes three the next morning. So
weary was she after the first of these
parties that, although she threw herself on
the bed dressed as she was, she over-slept,
and Mr Price's shaving-water was quarter
of an hour late, an offence so enormous
that the fussy little man wasted another
quarter of an hour in expounding his
"particular" views of punctuality and
duty, and forgiveness " for that occasion."

There were parties abroad, as well as
these parties at home, and then Bessyy was
required to officiate as lady's-maid. She

did her best, but was certainly inexperienced,
and was rewarded by ejaculations
on her clumsiness, her stupidity, in the
arrangement of finery for which she had
not even a name. Sometimes Mr Price
went direct from his place of business,
sometimes from home, and then there was
more running up and down stairs in attendance
on him, to bring this or find that,
than in waiting on the lady.

It was a relief when their cab rolled
away from the door with them in it. But
there was always a bedroom and dressing-room
to be cleared and set in order ; and
long after Ann had gone to bed she was
required to sit up, to keep a fire alight and
have coffee ready for her master and mistress
when they came home, at all hours in
the morning.

She was a good gentlewoman, and used
to fill up the interval with sewing, sometimes
for herself, sometimes for Ann ; but
it was not always easy to keep awake ; yet,
when the grey dawn crept in before they
came home to their coffee, she began to

bestir herself as soon as they had gone to
bed, with the sweeping and dusting of her
ordinary morning work.

She found it easier to sit up all night,"
she said, " than to rise in a couple of hours
if she only went to rest at four in the
morning."

You can please yourself, Bessyy, but
don't say I kept you up," remarked Mrs
Price, when Bessyy said this, ignoring the
fact that she had already been kept up ;
and she never thanked the girl for sitting
alone far into the morning to have the
comfortable coffee ready at a moment's
notice — never made her a present in
acknowledge-ment.

Spring was far advanced, and Bessyy was
in hopes this party giving and going
would soon be over, when one morning
the confectioner's errand-boy came with a
message that her sister was at Mrs
Amoryy's shop and wanted to see her. She
had received no intimation of Sarah's
coming since the letter in November, and
she looked at the bov in astonishment.

Wait," said she to him, and went to
ask if she could be spared for a couple of
hours that afternoon, as her sister was in
town.

I wonder you can ask such a thing,"
was the answer. " Am I not going to the
theatre this evening ? "

I could be back in time to help you
to dress," suggested Bessyy.

I gave you my answer."

Bessyy set her lips with a look of determination.


Tell my sister, if you please, that I
cannot see her until this evening after
half-past seven, and that she had better
come up the lane to meet me," was the
message she sent back by the boy, with
the addendum, " and here is sixpence for
your trouble."

Ann, coming downstairs with the
youngest children arrayed for a walk, had
lingered to hear what was going on. Sending
the boys down the garden walk before
her, she stopped a moment to say, —

These lads will never go past Amoryy's

o

without a cake, so I shall have a chance of
seeing your sister beforehand, and can tell
how the land lies ; and perhaps bring you
some word back."

A nod and a smile were all Bessyy's acquiescence,
but she felt grateful to the
kind-hearted nurse ; and, closing the door,
hurried back to shell peas and worry herself
with anxiety on account of her sister,
who had evidently come to Brassington on
a sudden, and without a home or a place to
go to.

She knew, also, that if Clara chose to
tell tales her own situation would be risked
if she went out. She had not been so comfortable
as to make that of much account,
but she had become attached to her fellow-servant,
and did not care to leave her.

Ann was back with the unruly boys,
Clara was home from school, the lamb, and
peas, and mint sauce were on the diningroom
table, and Mrs Price seated with her
family around her, before she had a chance
of hearing more from Ann than that she
had seen her sister.

She then told her that Sarah had come
to Brassineton in search for a situation, and
seemed to expect her sister to find her one
without trouble or difficulty,

But," said Ann, " I told her she'd have
to feet rid of some of her frills and furbelows
if she wanted to get into a respectable place,
and I don't think she thanked me,orbelieved
me. However, I asked Mrs Amoryy if she
knew of any decent people about, that your
sister could stay with till she got into a
situation ; and Mrs Amoryy — bless her good
heart! — said should send her servantwith
Sarah to the house of one of her bakers,
where she might perhaps stay to-night."

It was a load off Bessyy's mind; nevertheless,
she went about her work that afternoon
as if in a dream. She thought Mrs
Price was never so tedious or so fastidious
over her toilette, and was thankful that she
had to meet Mr Price in town — doubly
thankful that Clara had gone to take tea
with a schoolfellow.

The meeting with Sarah was anything
but pleasing or cheering. Sarah had, as she

conjectured, left home in a huff. Emma
White was installed at the farm and seemed
of more account than she was, and she
could not stand it. She had a quarrel
with Reuben, and so she came away. She
would rather be a servant to strangers than
be ordered about by her brother. Oh, she
should get a place soon enough, never
fear ; and she'd got a lodging, and she
wasn't without money. Her mother had
given her three pounds as she came away.

She did get a situation, and sooner than
she deserved, for Bessyy went with her as far
as the confectioner's to thank Mrs Amoryy,
and ask if she knew anyone in want of a
domestic.

"Well," said Mrs Amoryy, "I've a sister
whose servant is leaving in a few days ;
I'll speak to her. If this young woman is
anything like yourself, I should think she
would suit. But theirs is a tradesman's
family, and there are children in the house."

And on the strength of Bessyy's own character,
as far as Mrs Amoryy could judge
from what she had seen and heard of her.

Sarah was soon installed as general servant
under the roof of Abel Moore, an ironmonger,
whose wife took an active part in
the management of her household — soon
Bessyy had the pleasure to hear her sister's
industry and cleanliness well spoken of, and
sent the report home for the consolation of
the mother whose life had so few joys.

There were times when Bessyy took herself
to task for leaving her mother, and so
setting up a precedent for her younger sister
— times when she debated whether it
was not her duty to return home and take
her part in the farmhouse as of old. But
Tom, and her father, and her Aunt Hales,
all stood in the gap, and, one way or the
other, she felt return to be impossible.

Amongst the village gossip Sarah had
retailed was one item which cut her sister
with a keener edo-e than she would have
been willing to admit. Tom Ashtead was
said to be making up to Rebecca Perks,
Matty's companion ; and though she argued
within herself that what he did, or whom
he courted, was no manner of consequence

to her, the old wound was opened afresh,
and smarted sorely.

Letters passed but seldom between Birch
Farm and the two servant-maids in Brassington,
but when they did Reuben was the
scribe, and he never so much as named his
old friend Tom, and Bessyy was too proud
to ask if Sarah's news was true. Yet she
felt it very hard that he should forget her
so soon.

Very quietly and sedately she went about
her work, obeying orders without question
or cavil, but without animation, and the
Prices set her down as sulky. The work
was, however, done, and done thoroughly ;
and if she made no demonstration of affection
for the children, there were no noisy
quarrels with them in the kitchen.

Mrs Price, hard to please, had not settled
the value of Bessyy as a domestic when the
question was unexpectedly settled for her.

In the autumn the brother and partner
of Mr Price took unto himself a wife, and
there was much feasting and visiting inconsequence.
Of course there was a party

VOL. III. B

at Laburnum Villa, and Bessyy was at work
late and early for days in advance ; though
now that baby was two years old Ann could
give her occasional assistance, and, as if
stimulated by the excitement of the wedding,
the girls worked away with a will, and
even Mrs Price seemed satisfied with the
result.

I think I have made it sufficiently apparent
that, however mean and parsimonious
Mrs Price was in ordinary, there was
neither stint nor scant in her entertainments
; but I am not sure it is so clear that
her maids had no liberty to help themselves
out of the profusion. Mrs Price's hospitality
stopped at the kitchen door. Her
servants might look, and long for a taste of
the dainties, but remnants fell to the children's
share the next day, and a slice of
cake or a spoonful of blanc-mange very
rarely found its way to the domestics.

It so happened that on this occasion Mrs
Price forgot to cut the girls their supper, or
even to indicate what they might consume.

Dear me," said Ann, after fidgeting

about, " I am so hungry. Are you sure
missis never said what we might have ?
I should Hke a piece of that apple-pie."

Bessyy was sitting wearily on a chair by
the table, on which her elbow rested as a
support for her hand ; piles of plates were
on the floor, and the dresser was filled with
dishes of tempting viands in all stages of
consumption. A tray of unwashed china
coffee-cups half filled the deal table.

Without looking up she answered, "Quite
sure ! She was too much occupied with
the bride to think of us. But I wouldn't
touch the pie if I were you. She is certain
to be cross if you do. For my part, I shall
just have a cup of coffee ; my appetite is
gone."

But mine is not, and I shall help myself
to the pie. I must have something for
my supper."

I think you had better not," was Bessyy's
advice as she rose to pour out a cup of
coffee for herself, and, after drinking it off,
began to wash up the best china.

Ann had cut off a section of the pie ;

Bessyy, never too profuse with her speech,
made no further comment, though she saw
Ann devour it with rare gusto, and had her
own opinion on the enormity of the offence.

Morning proved her right. There was
a stern inquisition on the remains of the
apple-pie.

Ann's confession that she ate it for her
supper did not mend matters.

You had not told us what we was to
have," said Ann, " and I did not think
there was any harm. I could not make
my supper on a cup of coffee after a hard
day's work, if Bessyy could."

You micrht have taken bread and
cheese if you were hungry ; but to help
yourself to apple-pie without leave was a
liberty I cannot overlook."

And if I'd taken the cheese without
leave it would have been just the same,"
quoth Ann deprecatingly.

No impertinence ; I'll not have it !"

I don't think Ann meant to be impertinent,"
put in Bessyy.

Did she not ? I see it in her face.

Perhaps there was no impertinence in eating
the pie which should have come to the
table to-day ! But your conduct this week
has not pleased me at all, Ann, and you
had better provide yourself with a new
situation by this day month."

Very well, mari, and I hopes I may
get a better one ; for more unruly children
I never did see, and food might be more
plentiful," cried Ann, her temper up.

Mrs Price was leaving the kitchen, her
own temper not under control. Bessyy's
simple "cup of coffee" recurred to her as
an irritating reflection on scarcity in the
midst of plenty. She turned round in the
doorway, and addressing the young woman,
said, with lofty asperity, " And if you are
not satisfied, Bessyy, you can leave at the
same time."

Very well, ma'am," was the sole response
; and if Mrs Price expected Elizabeth
Birch to protest that she was satisfied,
for the sake of retaining her situation, she
was disappointed.

Mrs Amoryy's shop was situated on the

main road, just below the fork of West
Lane and East Lane, a favourable position,
as commanding the private custom of both
thoroughfares and their branches right and
left, consequently she had a snug and respectable
business.

Amongst her many customers she numbered
the wife of a civil engineer named
Cowper, whose house in Park Place turned
a shoulder to East Lane at the summit of
the hill.

It so happened that about three weeks
after the wedding-party at Laburnum Villa,
Mrs Cowper walked into Mrs Amoryy's shop
for a bun for a little girl she held by the
hand, and for some tea-cakes. They were
both in mourning for an elder sister of the
little one, then approaching her second year.

Now, Fanny, you sit there and wait
patiently," said Mrs Cowper, as she lifted
the child to a tall chair and remained
standing until a young woman with a basket
at the counter was served. Then a
bun was handed to the child, and, as the
tea cakes were being papered, Mrs Cowper

asked, " Can you recommend a good servant
to me, Mrs Amoryy ? "

Dear me, is your Irish girl leaving ?"
was the ejaculation which came in response.


I am sorry to say — yes. Poor Bridget
has never been herself since my little Geraldine
died ; the faithful creature, who was
greatly attached to the child, attributed
her death to some neglect on her part, and
was not to be kept out of the room where
the dead dear one lay. She has been ailing
ever since, and now she has gone into the
hospital, refusing to remain longer a burden
on my hands. She has fretted herself
into such a condition that she is not likely
to leave the hospital for so long a time I
am compelled to supply her place. If I
am suited when she comes out, I must endeavour
to find her a comfortable situation
elsewhere."

Dear me, I am sorry for the girl ; she
looked so neat and clean, and seemed so
thoroughly content. But if you want
another — why the very young woman who

was at this counter when you came in is
leaving her place, and, I should think,
would suit you exactly. She is a respectable,
well - behaved girl — a farmer's
daughter. Her sister is living with my
sister, Mrs Moore, the ironmonger's wife
down below, and is a hard-working, honest
lass, though a bit given to finery, and
gadding."

There did not seem anything of that
about the young woman just gone out.
She appeared rather grave and sedate," remarked
Mrs Cowper.

*' So she is," replied the confectioner.

"And where is the girl living now?"
was the next question.

With a Mrs Price, at Laburnum Villa,
West Lane ; but pray don't mention that
I have recommended Bessyy Birch, for Mrs
Price is a good customer of mine, and very
touchy. If you are not in a hurry I can
send the girl to you the next time she
comes, or I can send a message to her."

Oh, thank you, I shall be much obliged
if you will. Come, Fanny, now you

have eaten your bun, we must be off to
have papa's tea ready," and Mrs Cowper
went her way.

The following afternoon the charwoman,
on temporary duty at Park Place, opened
the door for Bessyy Price, whose composed
demeanour — neither bold nor timid — made
an impression on Mrs Cowper. She answered
such questions as were put in respect
to qualifications with modesty and
propriety. But when she said " Ten
pounds," in answer to the query what
wages she expected, Mrs Cowper shook
her head, and said that was more than she
ever gave in the first instance ; she did
not mind an advance at the end of the
year if a maid suited.

I have ten pounds where I am, ma'am,
but I would not mind taking nine if I had
a comfortable home."

I suppose Mrs Price would give you
a character ? "

Oh yes, ma'am, if you do not mind
writings a note to ask when she could see
you.

And so it was arranged. Bessyy hurried
off, lest she should encounter a scolding.

The note was written and Mrs Price
made an appointment.

It was a dirty, drizzly, wet October day.
Not a day on which any sensible woman
would adorn herself with superfine raiment
to plod through the mire of suburban
lanes. Mrs Cowper encased her feet in
strong winter boots, and wrapped her
shoulders in a thick grey woollen shawl —
shawls had not then been superseded by
mantles.

The road she took — a short cut between
East Lane and West Lane — was unpaved
and muddy, the rain came down drearily ;
she was orlad she had clothed herself for
the weather.

At Laburnum Villa she was shown into
the drawing-room, and kept waiting long
enough to have taken an inventory of the
furniture, the showy ornaments, the glass
and gilding, before Mrs Price sailed in,
gay with ribbons and imposing in figured
silk, to eye the little woman in the grey

woollen shawl and black merino dress from
head to foot. She, however, motioned to
her visitor to reseat herself on a couch,
whilst she took a chair at right angles between
the door and the piano. The full
light of two windows was on their faces.

After a preliminary word or two, Mrs
Cowper asked if the young woman was
fond of children.

Anything but that ! Anything but
that ! " jerked out Mrs Price, throwing her
head and body forward as she spoke, in a
most unladylike manner, as if to give intensity
to her words.

Oh, then," said Mrs Cowper, rising,
I need ask nothing more. I have only
one little girl, still, I must have a maid who
likes children. But as she stood prepared
to go, it came across her mind like a flash
" There was temper in that speech. It
may be as well to ask something more,
now I am here," and she sat down
again.

"Is she honest and sober } "

For anything I know to the contrary."

Is she careful ? "

I do not give my servants an opportunity
to waste."

Well, I do not lock anything up, and
it is a matter of importance to me ? "

A pretty housekeeper you must be ! "
was the expression on the face of Mrs
Price, though she merely said " Oh ! "

Can she wash and iron ? "

I believe so ; but as our washing is sent
to a laundress, she merely helps the nurse
to rub out a few of the children's things, and
her own clothes ; so I really cannot say."

Can she cook at all ? "

A plain dinner. I never trust her todo
anything particular, or to make pastry ;
I do it myself."

Well, I expect my servant to cook.
But I am prepared to instruct her first if she
be willing to learn. She appears cleanly."

Yes, but unless I look sharply after her
she does not remove the furniture when
she sweeps the rooms, and leaves dust in
the corners. I have frequently to make
her do it over again."

Um ! " thought Mrs Cowper, " this is
not very promising. I wonder if it is true ? "
Then she put her final questions.

I hope you will not think me intrusive
if I ask what wages she has had, how long
she has been with you, and your reasons
for parting with her ? "

Oh, I gave her ten pounds, she has
been with me eighteen months, and '*' —
with a toss of the head — " my nurse was
leaving, so, as I generally change both
servants at once, I told Bessyy that if she
was not satisfied she mio^ht so too."

Thank you, I think I shall try her,"
said Mrs Cowper, with a faint smile.

She had come to a swift conclusion that
if the girl had kept her place so long, and
virtually dismissed herself in the end, she
could not be such a very bad servant after
all.

Yes, you can give her a month's trial,"
assented Mrs Price patronisingly, with a
shrug of the shoulders, and in a tone which
meant, " But you will not be satisfied with
the result."

o Bessyy and Others.

Bessyy and Ann together waited on Mrs
Cowper, both dressed alike, and otherwise
so similar that the lady scarcely knew
which was Bessyy Birch.

The reason for coming so accompanied
was soon apparent. After it was settled
that Bessyy should come for the customary
" month on trial," she said to Mrs
Cowper, —

This is my fellow-servant, ma'am. She
has been my only companion whilst with
Mrs Price ; she has got a situation as nurse
at the bottom of the hill, and if you will
be pleased to let me have my ' Sunday out '
on the same afternoon as hers, I should
be very much obliged. I have brought
her with me that you might see she was
a respectable companion for me. And
I hope, ma'am, you don't object to my
mother, or my brother, coming to see me
if ever they come to Brassington."

Certainly not. The ties of kindred
should always be respected. And, Bessyy,
if you should happen to have a sweetheart
a respectable man fit for a decent girl —

we would rather that he came to see you
here than have you meet him at street-corners,
which is anything but reputable."

Oh, thank you, ma'am, you are very
kind. Mrs Price did not allow any followers,
not even my own relations, who
lived so far off. But I have no sweetheart,
ma'am, to meet me either here or elsewhere,"
and, though her cheek flushed,
there was a mournful cadence in her voice
which suggested to her new mistress a story
of heart-sorrow.

The day Bessyy entered on her new
situation, Mrs Price marched into the shop
of Mrs Amoryy and accosted her abruptly.

What business had you, Mrs Amoryy,
to recommend my servant to anyone
else."

Mrs Amoryy, taken aback, could only
say,—

Well, madam, Bessyy said she was leaving
you, and asked if I knew of a vacant
situation, and as I happened to know her
sister, when Mrs Cowper asked me to
recommend a servant, I mentioned Bessyy

Bessyy and Others.

Birch, I had no idea you didn't want to
part with her."

Part with her or not, Mrs Cowper, who
came to vie for her character huddled up
in a great woollen shawl, has engaged her.
And I hope the woman will have enough
of her ! "

And having jerked these words out with
ill-tempered energy, Mrs Price left the shop
without so much as a "Good afternoon."

HAND AND HEART.

O she hoped the woman would
have enough of her, did she ? "
echoed Mrs Cowper, when Mrs
Amoryy, annoyed at Mrs Price's
unladyHke dictation, repeated her irate observation
to Bessyy's new mistress.

Yes ; and it's my opinion she never
either intended or expected Bessyy to
go, and is mad the girl took her at
her word. It's much to me if she finds
two young women likely to stop with her
so long as the two who have just left.
Until Ann went there, two years ago, a
servant very rarely stayed at Laburnum

VOL. III. c

Villa more than two or three months ; and
many of those who went on trial were
either turned out or turned themselves out
before the month was up. You see, ma'am,
I've been here many years, and in an open
shop, where one has the custom of a neighbourhood,
all sorts of news and gossip come
without seeking, and it's not possible to
shut our ears or our eyes. In does not
need much discrimination in a business like
ours to distinguish between the good
servants and the bad ones, or the good
mistresses and bad ones, amongst
customers, or to know if one side or
the other complains without cause. But
behind a counter you must hear, see,
and say nothing ; and had not Mrs Price
been so insulting, even to myself, I do
not suppose I should have mentioned her
rudeness now."

Well, Mrs Amoryy," said Mrs Cowper,
as she opened her purse to pay for a
sponge-cake she had been buying, " I have
a theory that — allowing for individual difference
of disposition and previous training

— servants are, as a rule, pretty much
what their mistresses make them. In my
mother's household, the maids generally
remained until they married, and went to
homes of their own, and certainly were
friends of the family in their humbler sphere.
But times are much changed, and in few
things more than in the relations between
employers and the employed. Ceremony
has abolished familiarity, and much of the
old hearty good-feeling has gone with it, I
am sorry to say."

Indeed, you're right," said the confectioner,
while she wrapped up some gingerbread
for a child ; ** and I think sometimes
nowadays ladies often hire their servants
as if they were only sweeping and dusting
machines, and grumble if the machines get
out of order for want of a little sympathetic
oil."

Just so ; I think Mrs Price is one of
that class. At all events, though she gave
me but an indifferent character with Bessyy
Birch, I find no reason to complain as yet.
However, I shall be better able to judge

o

after a while. Bessyy is but a new broom
at present. Good day."

Nor did Mrs Amoryy hear any complaints
from either mistress or maid.

The fact is, Bessyy very soon discovered
that she had made a change for the better.
There was less pretence in the Cowper
household than the Prices', and more
comfort.

On her entrance, Mrs Cowper had not
merely indicated the room in which she
was to sleep, and in which the porter had
to deposit her box, but went with her over
the house, merely specifying the uses of the
several rooms ; and, in the girl's own department,
showing where food, napery,
culinary or other utensils, brooms, and
such domestic appliances were kept, little
Fanny trotting beside them, quietly observant,
as if measuring the new maid in
her undeveloped mind.

The survey ended with a sort of speech
from Mrs Cowper, who stood with her hand
resting on the well-scrubbed kitchen table.

Now, Bessyy, I have shown you where

everything is kept, and I would impress
upon you that I expect you to keep things
in the places where you find them. When
I enter a new house I make all my own
arrangements, and I like them to be preserved
as far as possible," (" Oh, dear,"
thought Bessyy, " I hope she is not one of
the very particular" people") " You see
that if my servant is away for a holiday, I
like to be sure where to lay my own hands
on anything I might want to use."

Certainly," said Bessyy, thinking, " that
is only reasonable,"

"You will see," Mrs Cowper went on,
that nothing is locked up ; but not because
I can afford to waste — no one can do
that whilst there is a beggar needing food
but because I expect you to be as careful
of our food and our property as if it were
your own. I hope you understand the difference
between frugality and parsimony,"

Yes, ma'am."

Very well, then, you will understand
the nature of the trust I repose in you.
We wash on a Tuesday ; sweeping and

cleaning days you can settle for yourself.
I shall not interfere with you so long as
you do your work properly ; but you must
quite understand that I cannot do with
surface cleaning. No dust must be left in
corners, and the backs of chairs must be as
bright as the fronts. I dare say," she continued,
" from this long exordium, you imagine
I am very particular." (Bessyy did.)
/ ant. But I trust I am not a fidget ;
and I think it is due to you, as well as to
myself, that we begin with a proper understandings.
And I think we shall do that
better if you are told that I do not think
the duties of maid or mistress begin and
end with work done and money paid — so
much labour for so many coins. There is
heart service as well as hand service ; and
here the mistress must take her part as
well as the maid. Both myself and Mr
Cowper take an interest in those who
serve us faithfully, and we hope our servants
feel the same interest in us. I told
you before that I do not allow outdoor
gossip, but that you are welcome to receive

either a respectable friend or sweetheart
here at reasonable times. And now,
Fanny, dear, let us leave Bessyy to set
the tea-tray. It is time you were washed
and had a clean pinafore ; papa will be
home soon."

And whilst Bessyy, struck with the contrast
between Mrs Cowper's opening
address and that of Mrs Price, could
only give expression to her feelings in a
sober — " Thank you, ma'am ; you are very
kind," her new mistress, taking the child
by the hand, left her to herself.

"It would be a poor tale if I couldn't
keep this place in order," murmured Bessyy,
in an undertone, as she moved about between
tray-rest, table, cupboard, and pantry,
or stirred the fire as a hint to the kettle ;
the family is really so small, though the
house is, I think, as large as the Prices' ;
and everything is nice and clean to start
with — no holes and corners to be routed
out here that I can see. I wonder if Mrs
Cowper has had a charwoman or done the
work herself whilst without servant. It

does not look like the slipshod cleaning of
a charwoman. At all events, mistress must
have had a hand in it."

Bessyy had a vivid recollection of the
turnout of mouldy rags and other foul
refuse from the kitchen drawers and cupboards,
and beneath the scullery sink, with
which accumulations " particular " Mrs
Price had accredited servant and charwoman
antecedent to her own advent, and
she had not forgotten the remark, — "Ah !
they're all the same ; you never find out
what they've left till a fresh servant comes.
It's wholesome to make a change now and
again." And the difference impressed her
with a sense of Mrs Cowper's thoroughness
rather than of vexatious particularity.

Mrs Cowper's sitting-room was a pleasant
apartment, in general occupation, even
for meals. Though at the back of the
house, it had a southern aspect, and a glass
door, with a tinted border, opened on a
winding path, among tall evergreens down
to the main garden — a bit of shrubbery
which kept the yard and brew house well

out of sight. It was Infinitely preferable
to the larger and more elaborately furnished
withdrawing-room, which never had a
glimpse of sunshine, and needed artificial
light to set it off.

Into this bright room Bessyy carried the
tea-tray, and here Mrs Cowper kept her
tea-caddy. Into the teapot went Mrs
Cowper's quantum of tea, and then the
spoon went into the caddy and left the
contents in a cup. This was handed to
Bessyy.

There is your tea ; you know which is
your small teapot. You can have your tea
whilst we have ours ; but you will have to
bring in a fresh cup."

"If you please, ma'am, where is the
kitchen butter kept ? " then asked Bessyy.

Mrs Cowper looked up.

"Kitchen butter! I do not keep two
kinds. You will use the same that we
do."

Oh ; I did not know ! " said Bessyy, in
the tone of one caught in an involuntary
confession.

There was the dick of a latch-key in the
front door.

Papa ! Papa ! " cried Fanny, scampering
off to meet him ; and, before Bessyy
could leave the room, her new master — a
tall, fine-looking man — stood in the doorway,
with Fanny in his arms. On the
threshold he paused — a genial smile lit his
face.

So this is Bessyy, I suppose. Well,
my lass, I hope you will be comfortable
here, and that you will make us comfortable
too."

His smile was reflected in Bessyy's
face.

I hope so, too, sir," said she, and
passed out to the kitchen much more
cheerily than when Mr Price held her
under inquisition.

A keen observer was Mr Cowper. Before
the night was out he said to his
wife, —

I like that girl's face. It is not handsome,
and there is a gravity about it very
unusual in one of her years. I should say

there had been some great sorrow in her
life which had taken the Hight out of it.
But she looks thoroughly reliable and
trustworthy ; and she'll soon cheer up in
my little wife's care, I know. What does
Fanny think of her ? "

"Well, I was going to take Fanny to
bed, and Bessyy offered to do it. I expected
the child would object. But no ;
she said, ' Yes, Bessyy put me to bed.
Good-night, mamma ! ' and up went the
rosy mouth to be kissed, as her foot was
on the stair. I think it augurs well for
our new maid, does the child's confidence
in her ; for she certainly had made no
attempt to cajole or win Fanny over."

I think so, too. A child's instinct
may be trusted."

Mr Cowper dined at home the following
day. There was a shoulder of mutton to
be roasted, vegetables to be boiled, and a
jam tart to be made.

Mrs Cowper, having been told that Bessyy
was no pastry cook, went into the kitchen
to make the tart, and, without seeming to

observe, took note of her new maid's proceedings.


We have onion sauce served with
shoulder of mutton, Bessyy. You will find
a rope or two of onions in the larder. Do
you know how to make it ? "

Yes, ma'am ; " and Bessyy explained
her process.

It was as satisfactory as her treatment
of the vegetables and the joint — as satisfactory
as her own treatment when dinner
was placed upon the table.

"Another hot plate" was asked for. It
was brought, and Bessyy was retiring.

Stay," said her master, " whilst I cut
your dinner ; we like our domestic to have
her meals as warm as ours."

That will be sufficient for me, sir,"
remarked Bessyy, as the carving-knife went
again to the joint.

Nonsense," he answered. " A girl
that works hard requires good food."

Yes, sir, but I have a small appetite,"
was her reply, to which she felt strongly
inclined to add that he had already laid on

her plate double the quantity Mrs Price
would have deemed sufficient.

Bessyy enjoyed her dinner. It was the
first warm and comfortable meal she had
had since she left home, the comfort being
enhanced by a clean kitchen table-cloth,
salt-cellar, and pepper-box — three decencies
which had place in Mrs Price's kitchen ;
moreover, she had uninterrupted leisure to
eat it, had her full share of the jam tart,
and was told she had cooked the whole
very nicely, which telling served her for
dessert.

The word of approbation sent her about
her work cheerily ; it was something new
to her. She had only known when Mrs
Price was satisfied by the absence of faultfinding.
Praise was a stimulant not in
that lady's vocabulary.

On the second Sunday when Ann called
for Bessyy to go out, a heavy shower was
falling.

Mrs Cowper, sitting by the drawing-room
window with Fanny on her lap, saw her
pass to the side entrance. Immediately

after, although it was not tea time, Bessyy
brought in the tray, and arranged the table
in readiness very orderly.

I suppose I can go now, ma'am ? " she
said.

Yes, unless you would prefer asking
your friend to stay and have tea with you,
as it is raining. It may clear up before
church time."

Bessyy's eyelids raised.

"Thank you, ma'am;" and she left the
room with a sort of courtesy, Fanny struggling
from her mamma's lap to run and
make the acquaintance of the new arrival.

"Mrs Cowper says I had better ask you
to stay and have tea with me, as it is wet ;
so you may as well take your things off,
Ann, and hang them up," she began, on
her return to the kitchen.

Do what ? " exclaimed Ann, in surprise.
Well, that's more than my missis would
say, though she's not as stingy as Mrs
Price! It's very kind of Mrs Cowper, I
must say."

Yes, she is very kind, and so is master ;

and the child's a dear little things — one
cannot help but love It."

Hash ! Little pitchers have long
ears."

Bessyy turned ; Fanny, close at her heels,
gave her hand a little squeeze, then scampered
off to justify Ann's remark by reporting
the speech concerning herself, with the
addition — " and me love Bessyy."

Hem," came, between the whiffs of a
cigar, from Mr Cowper. " I thought
Bessyy did not like children ? "

Ah, it is but one of Mrs Price's fables ! "
cried his wife. " Bessyy's all right so far ;
she goes about her work systematically
and steadily, and, I think, will prove a
valuable servant — but time tries all."

Conversation in the kitchen went on,
after Fanny ran off, much in the same
strain, Ann telling how she got on in the
nursery with her charges — of the baby
who was teething, and kept her awake at
night ; but she ended by saying, " Still the
children are not such rapscallions as the
Prices', and missis lias a conscience, and

she don't starve one, and don't set the
children to tell tales."

Bessyy laid her cloth, and set her little
tray for tea.

Ann opened her eyes.

"My word, how grand we are ! What
would Mrs Price say if she saw us ? A
table-cloth and a tray ! You beat us at
Middleton's even. And that's good butter ;
we've only tub butter."

Yes, Ann, and I don't have to wait
till the dinner is cold to have a morsel
doled out as if to a beggar. I have it hot
and comfortable ; and, talking of beggars,
they're not turned from the door here as if
they were thieves. Mrs Cowper says she
would rather be twice taken in than once
dismiss a case of real necessity. And,
when my work is done, Mrs Cowper finds
me books to read ; really good books — not
trash."

Well, Bessyy, I should say you've lit
upon your feet. I never had such a place
but once, and then missis died. But I'd
have done anything in the world for he'.

An' I should think you'd put your best foot
foremost here."

That I would ! " was spoken with
emphasis.

She did, and as the months went by,
both Bessyy and her mistress made fresh
discoveries, little to the credit of Mrs
Price. Mrs Cowper had long discovered
that Bessyy did not leave dust in corners, or
behind furniture ; that she was a good and
a frugal cook, and, after the lapse of time,
that she could make as light pastry as herself,
and was willing to do it. An offer to
get up " the lace collars and sleeves, which
Mrs Cowper had hitherto done for herself,
somehow elicited the fact that Mrs Price
did not put out her washing ; that she sent
to the laundress no more than did Mrs
Cowper, namely, the master's linen and the
muslins, and that instead of Bessyy "helping
the nurse to rub out a few things for the
children," it was Ann who helped her from
four in the morning until twenty minutes
past seven, and that at a large family wash,
interrupted by the putting up of lines, the

VOL. III. D

hanging out of clothes, and the daily demands
of the household.

It was the first thing Bessyy had said
against her former mistress, and it only
came out in correcting what she considered
a mistake. Mrs Cowper could not refrain
from reporting it, both to her own
spouse and Mrs Amoryy.

What a liar that woman must be ! "
exclaimed Mr Cowper. " She certainly
deserves exposing. First entraps a girl
with a spurious advertisement, then overworks
her, and, when she throws off the
galling yoke, tries to rob her of her livelihood.
It is to be hoped there are not
many women like her."

Ah, Jack, I'm afraid there are more Mrs
Prices than one in the world. Don't you
remember what an indifferent character I
had with poor Bridget ? And I'm sure a
more faithful, honest, sober, industrious
and cleanly girl never came into a house.
Her only failings were a bad memory and
a want of order and system. She could
never put up her tins and brasses in their

places — I had always to re-arrange them ;
but she had as warm a heart as ever beat
in a breast."

Yes, my dear, and that shows the
double Injustice that may be done by a
woman of Mrs Price's temper and calibre.
If your discernment had not penetrated
beneath the surface of actual expression,
we might have lost a good servant, and
Bessyy a — well, suppose we say — a pretty
tolerable place."

Oh, yes, ma'am, I know it's true," said
Mrs Amoryy ; " all Mrs Price's servants
say the same thing. She has had quite a
regiment — changing almost every second
month since Bess and Ann left — and all
complain of a large, rude family, and heavy
washes which they never bargained to do.
Some of them seemed quite downcast and
oppressed, and others tossed their heads,
and said they liked to do things to spite
her. It's an old saying, madam, that ' a
good Jack makes a good Jill ; ' and I say a
good mistress may make a good maid.

^'^,

x>.

But " — and she paused — " have you heard
that your Bessyy's sister is leaving my
sister ? "

"No, I have not. Bessyy is not talkative,
and not communicative. Perhaps
she does not wish to intrude on us with
her affairs. I have observed that she
seemed depressed by a letter she received ;
but her letters generally seem to have a
saddening influence, so I did not think it
anything unusual. If it is a fair question,
why is Sarah leaving ? I thought she was
a capital servant."

Well, Mrs Cowper, so she is hardworking,
clean, and brisk ; but you know
there are young men in my brother-in-law's
shop, and Sarah will waste her time gossipping
with them ; and she is too fond of
finery and going out."

"Not a very uncommon failing that in
young women of much higher social rank
than Sarah," was Mrs Cowper's smiling reply;
"and, in moderation, I see no harm in
it. There must be something wrote in the
life of a girl who does not care for a chat

with the young men. Neither you nor I
found our husbands in a nunnery, I've a
suspicion. I'll have a talk to Bessyy about
her sister."

When Mrs Cowper reached home, she
found a neatly-dressed woman, rather over
middle-age, in the kitchen with Bessyy.
She wore a plain black satin bonnet, lined
with white ; there were loops of narrow
white satin ribbon in the cap border, in
which her clear - complexioned face was
set ; a well-saved shot-silk shawl, which
had been bought very many years before,
was thrown open on account of the heat,
and, under all, was a plain brown merino
dress. A large, white wicker basket was
on the ground beside her.

She rose on Mrs Cowper's entrance.

"My mother, from Kitknoll," was Bessyy's
introduction.

Mrs Cowper put out her hand.

How do you do, Mrs Birch ? I am
glad to see you. I always am glad to seethe
relatives of those who serve me well."

Then Bessyy gives you satisfaction,

ma'am ? That's a good hearing. But
she always was a good, steady girl ; though
she's had her troubles, poor thing, like the
rest of us."

So we have supposed ; but Bessyy has
not talked of her troubles, and has done
her work in spite of them, like a brave
girl. I suppose her sister's loss of situation
is a fresh trouble to you all ? "

Yes, ma'am ; I was not aware she had
told you. It was a trouble the lass leavings
home at all. She was wanted on the
farm."

Bessyy did not tell me. I heard it
whilst I have been out ; and I have also
heard that a friend of ours is in want of a
servant, and have mentioned Sarah to her.
Mrs Leeke has seen Bessyy frequently, and,
I think, from her appearance and conduct,
is already prepossessed in favour of her
sister. But Sarah had better see me before
she waits on Mrs Leeke. And I
think, Bessyy, you had better ask your
mother to take off her bonnet and have
dinner with you, after coming so far."

Both Bessyy and her mother looked
pleased. After thanking her mistress, the
former said, —

Mother has taken the liberty to bring
you some butter of her own making, and a
few fresh-laid eggs ; and she brought a
few cherries and a posy for Miss Fanny,
if you will please to accept them."

Of course she accepted them, as much
gratified in receiving as they in giving.
The cherries and the " posy " were already
in Miss Fanny's possession — the former
fast disappearing ; the sweet-scented nosegay,
odorous of gratitude and goodwill, was
placed in water, on a stand by the window,
over which Fanny was keeping guard —
with pairs of cherries looped over her little
ears as adornments.

It was no lifjht matter that had brought
Mrs Birch so far from her own hearthstone.
She was anxious about Sarah,
whose flightiness had been a source of
serious uneasiness before she left home,
and had come to ascertain for herself why
she was leaving the ironmonger's, being

anything but satisfied by Sarah's own account.
Then she had all a mother's longing
to see Elizabeth (or Bessyy), and assure
herself that she was doing well, and not
pining after Tom Ashtead. But she
brought little comfort for the girl in anyway.


There had been a quarrel at the Ash-teats',
it was believed because Tom refused
to marry Rebecca Perks, and Tom was
going out to Australia to join his cousin,
who had a sheep-run somewhere in Victoria.


Her father grew worse and worse ;
sometimes he stayed at her Aunt Hailes'
for days together, spending his money like
water ; and if it were not for Reuben the
farm would go to ruin. " He was a good
lad," she said, " and did his best to keep
his father in order, but that was scarcely
possible, for he would drink nearly a pint
of brandy before breakfast. Emma White
could manage him the best ; he was somehow
ashamed of showing off before her.
Reuben seemed to have a mind to the

lass ; and really," she said, " he might do
worse. Emma would make a thrifty
farmer's wife, and a lad with such a father
could not pick and choose. As for Jim,
he was fair off his head after that flirty
Matty Ashtead, who was all smiles one
day, and all scorn the next, and had more
strings to her bow than her bonnet. If it
had not been for Reuben, Jim would have
been off and listed for a soldier, more than
once, and all through her. It was a great
comfort that Reuben stuck by the farm so
steadily."

Yes," Bessyy assented, " so it is ; "
but she sighed heavily, as if she felt
the words a reproach to herself, though
nothing had been farther from the mother's
thought.

They saw Sarah, and her mistress ; and,
finding what was the cause of complaint,
gave the former a good "talking to," which
she did not take at all too kindly,

People are so mighty particular," she
said, with a flounce ; " as if I am bound to
have neither eyes, nor ears, nor tongue, if

a young man speaks civilly. I did my
work, and what more did they want ? "

Wanted you to respect yourself, and
not disgrace your family," was Bessyy's
answer.

Umph ! I think that's pretty well disgraced
already," was the pert reply, which
brought a flush to the cheeks of her sister,
and tears into the mild eyes of her mother.

I think mother has quite enough to
bear, without you having a fling at her,"
Bessyy observed reproachfully ; whereupon
Sarah flung her arms around the mother's
neck, and entreated forgiveness, promising
to be "sober as old Time " in her next
place.

For that next place with Mrs Leeke she
was indebted to Mrs Cowper, and to the
discreet conduct of her less erratic sister.

Mrs Cowper, without seeming to know
anvthinof of her flio-htiness, informed her
that the Leeks' had a house, with the
manufactory, in town, and another in the
country ; that, notwithstanding their riches,
they were plain people in habits and

manners, and would treat her well if she
behaved well. But, as she would be
wanted for the town house, and numbers
of their hands, both male and female,
passed the kitchen on their way through
the open yard to the manufactory, she
would be required to comport herself
steadily, and not make free with any of
them — even if they came to the door with
messages. Mrs Leeke was in the manufactory
as well as her husband, and, so
long as she found her servants trustworthy,
was a liberal mistress ; but she was keen-eyed
and suspicious, and if she once suspected
her of misconduct of any kind,
would dismiss her on the instant. So she
knew what she had before her,

Sarah wondered if Mrs Cowper had
heard why she was leaving Mrs Moore.
But she promised to do her duty if Mrs
Leeke engaged her. And by the end of
the week she was hard at work for Mrs
Leeke.

Not long after this, Mr Cowper had the
offer of a lucrative appointment in London,

in connection with a railway in progress.
For some time he debated whether it was
worth while to throw up the post he held,
and break up his home in Brassington ; but
still more advantageous terms being offered,
he determined to explore the ground himself
first before removing his family.

He had barely been gone three weeks,
and Mrs Cowper was seated at breakfast
reading a lively letter from her liege lord,
when she thought she heard a curious noise
in the kitchen, and, bidding Fanny sit still,
went to ascertain what it was.

She found Bessyy with an open letter
clutched in a trembling clasp, her head
upon her arms on the table, and her whole
frame convulsed with sobs.

My poor girl," she said, in a tone of
deep sympathy, " what is the matter ?
Why are you so distressed ? Is there
anything I can do for you .'* Have
you ill news from home ? " And a
kindly arm went round Bessyy's shoulders.
My dear ! what is it ? " she continued.
Many times both myself and Mr

Cowper have said you had some deep
sorrow in your Hfe to make you so grave ;
but we had no right to intrude on private
griefs, which you so bravely covered
up. Your mother openly admitted you
had a heavy cross to bear. It might
lighten your load if you were to unburden
your mind to a friend. If you are not
afraid to take me into your confidence, I
may be able to give you either comfort or
counsel ; but if you would rather seek your
sister, or your friend Ann, you are at liberty
to go at once, if the matter is urgent."

** Thank you, ma'am ; but my trouble is
not one I could talk to Ann about. It is,
in part, a family trouble, and my sister has
had her share of it, but in a different way.
She does not take things to heart as I do,
and it is not a thing to take advice upon —
and — and I can only look to God for comfort
— and to time. I shall be better soon,
ma'am ; " and, as she said it, Bessyy rose as
if to resume her neglected duties — breakfast
untouched. Then, as if she felt that
she had repulsed Mrs Cowper's sympathy

ungraciously, she said, choking down her
sobs, " the truth is, ma'am, I have an aunt
who keeps a pubic-house, and that has led
my father on to drink ; and — and I had a
sweetheart, and his relations said he would
disgrace his family if he married me, because
of father ; and so I gave Tom up,
and came into service. And now he is
going away to Australia, and he has written
to say it is all my fault."

Perhaps you gave him up too hastily,"
observed Mrs Cowper.

I think not, ma'am. Tom seemed to
feel the disgrace as much as his family, and
I really could not blame him. Father's
conduct is outrageous ! Poor mother suffers
dreadfully ! But these are not things I
ought to talk about ; and — don't trouble
yourself about me, ma'am. I see you
are sorry for me, and it is very kind of
you ; but I shall be all right in a day or
two."

And, to outward appearance, she was all
right in a day or two. The discharge of
her pent-up feelings in tears, and the unbosoming

of their source to her friendly
mistress had done something towards her
relief.

Moreover, it seemed to set up a new
bond between the mistress and her maid,
to whom no duty appeared too heavy or
too arduous.

It is not to be supposed that either was
perfect ; and on one occasion when Mrs
Cowper had blamed her for something
Bessyy either had done or had not done, the
former asked, suddenly, —

How is it, Bessyy, that whenever I find
fault with you over anything I get no
answer? In fact, you preserve a dogged
silence when spoken to."

Well, the truth is, ma'am," answered
Bessyy, giving a more vigorous polish to a
brass candlestick, " I've a very bad temper
— yes, ma'am, I have ; and if I was
to answer I might say something I might
be sorry for afterwards ; so I just shut
my tongue within my teeth till my temper
goes down."

An admirable plan ! " said the mistress,

if you have a bad temper," and her tone
implied a doubt.

Yes, ma'am, I have. I know Mrs
Price thought me sullen. But I had to
keep my teeth shut there pretty close ; and
it was better to be thought sullen than let
my temper out and provoke someone else
to be ill-tempered too."

Mrs Cowper never mistook Bessyy's
silence again, and her respect for the young
woman grew stronger. But, indeed, the
esteem was mutual, and very soon put to
the proof.

MRS PRICE SEEKS ADVICE.

HE appointment offered to Mr
Cowper in London was one in
connection with a railway in progress,
and in a monetary aspect
much better than the one he held in Brassington
; but as its acceptance involved the
breaking up of a comfortable home, or,
rather, its transport to unknown regions
and untried associations, and the parting
from old friends, he deliberated — discussing
the question in all its bearings with
his little wife — and declined. An advance
was then made on the offer, more discussion
followed, and the result was acceptance.

VOL. III. E

Removals of this kind are not made ina
hurry. His present post had to be resigned
; a fresh tenant found for their
charming abode in Park Place ; household
goods to be packed and disposed of ; and
for this more than three months were
required.

At the outset a proposal was made for
Bessyy to accompany them to London — her
wages had already been advanced. It was
a simple enough proposal, but one which
seemed to involve as much consideration
as the more weighty proposal to her
master.

She was herself desirous to continue
with them, so kindly had she been treated.
If she had been ill or out of sorts, due consideration
had been made ; until at length
she felt herself a part of the family, and
their interests identical with her own, as
they evidently had intended she should
feel.

But she had her mother to consult, and
was afraid she would not like her to go sofar
out of reach.

You have never yet had a holiday,
Bessyy ; suppose you go home for a week,
and talk the matter over with your friends,"
suggested Mrs Cowper.

Bessyy changed colour. What sort of a
reception would she have at Kitknoll ?
True, Tom was no longer there to beset
her path, but would not the whole village,
and the Ashteads especially, blame her as
the cause of his emigration ? She hesitated
but a moment, then thanked her
mistress, and went in the strength and
consciousness of her own integrity.

She found things much as they had been
described. Emma White, who owed no
filial duty to Farmer Birch, interposing a
strong hand between him and Mrs Birch, as
none of his own children had dared to do ;
and when Reuben confided to her his intent
to make Emma his wife in a year 01
two, Bessyy congratulated him on his choice,
and said she thought he could not do better.

Coarse and brutal were her father's allusions
to the departure of Tom Ashtead,
and her home-coming, when he was no

longer there to meet her ; but she kept
guard over her own tongue, and let his
wag at will.

It only made her more inclined to accept
the proposal of the Cowpers, even though
her mother was adverse.

It is so very far away. Suppose anything
was to happen, how could we reach
you :

But, what should happen ? " asked
Bessyy. "And is there not a railway, and
a post-office within reach .'* London is not
as far as Australia."

Well, but — " and there was a world
of unspoken apprehension in the incomplete
sentence ; which was never finished.

Bessyy returned to Park Place as dubious
as she went.

Sarah came to see her the Sunday after
her return.

To her Bessyy's hesitation was incomprehensible.


Not go to London when you have
a chance, and with such a master and
missis ? " she cried, uplifting her hands

with amazement. " I should jump for joy
if such an offer was made to me. Mrs Cowper
doesn't knit her brows, and question
you over everybody that calls, and every
penny you go to lay out, as if she expected
to be robbed or cheated ; and she doesn't
expect you to get a shilling's worth of
garden stuff for sixpence, or half-a-crown's
worth of groceries for two shillings ; and
she doesn't think you've brought short
weight, and charged her for full weight,
and put the change in your pocket, as Mrs
Leeke does. It's one comfort to know
she pokes and pries, and watches and
spies, and suspects the girls in the manufactory
as well. I could never stand it if
I thought it was only me. And some day
I expect there'll be a row over that chip
money."

Chip money ! What's that ? " interrupted
Bessyy.

Why, don't you know, all the waste
wood, sloping and chips, big and little,
's cleared out of the workshops every
Saturday, and heaped up in the yard.

and it's sold for firewood, a cartload, ora
basketful at a time, just as it happens.
The folk come and help themselves, and
bring the money to me or anyone in the
kitchen, and the piles of copper lie there in
the window, for everyone going through
the yard to see, and the kitchen door
always stands wide open."

That seems to me more like careless
trust in others than meanness and suspicion,"
suggested Bessyy.

"Ah, so you would think; but I've a
notion she can tell to a shilling how much
the wood should bring in every week ; and
I can tell you I don't like the responsibility,
for the yard gates stand wide open and
anybody can come in, and if, some of these
days, one of the poor little ragged mites
sent for a pennyworth of chips should find no
one to take the penny, and walk off with
the pile of copper as well as the chips, the
blame would fall on my shoulders, as sure
as a fun. And I don't half like it, and so
I say that I wish I was in your place. And
I say, Bessyy, if you're such a fool as not to

know when your bread's well buttered, and
don't care to have a sight of London, I do ;
and if you won't go with Mrs Cowper, I
will ! "

** I think your sister might have waited
until she was asked," said Mrs Cowper,
when Bessyy announced her own conclusion
to migrate along with those she served, and
at the same time reported Sarah's offer.
She may be a very good servant, but she
would not suit me. She left her own home
without sufficient cause, and I consider her
wish to go with us less as a compliment
than as an undesirable desire for change on
her part."

Mrs Cowper was then in the very throng
and confusion of selection and package.
She was an active little woman, and wished
to have all the linen and breakables safe
before strange hands were laid upon them,
and she did not care to leave all to the last.
Mr Cowper had run up to London to make
arrangements there.

In the midst of it lite Fanny, taking
advantage of the pre-occupation of the

elders, ran out into the garden, often without
her hat, and, it was supposed, sat down
on the damp grass.

She was taken ill, apparently with a
slight cold, grew worse, the doctor was sent
for in the evening ; he delayed his coming
until the morning, ordered a little medicine,
and treated the matter lightly. His assistant
came the next day, with no apparent
knowledge of the case or of his master's
treatment ; he, too, regarded it as a slight
ailment, said "she must be kept warm,"
and went away.

The following day brought Mr Cowper
to find his little pet flushed and feverish,
and almost too languid to notice him — but
no doctor.

In the middle of the night the child became
alarmingly worse. Mr Cowper, dressing
hastily, hurried off in quest of the
nearest surgeon, leaving his wife and Bessyy
to do their unskilled best.

Door-plates he found, and bell-handles,
but not a doctor who would leave his bed
for a child" until he reached the very heart

o

of Brassington, and then a good physician
rose to do his duty. A young surgeon also
was found. Their own doctor was away
at some races or other.

It was six o'clock when Dr M — n reached
the bedside. It was then "too late" — a
case of " suppressed measles," he said.

Yet did the good physician all that
science could to fiorht with the disease.
There were three or four more anxious days
and nights, when the child was restless, and
all her cry was, " Walk about." And then
did Mrs Cowper learn the worth of Bessyy ;
for night or day was as one to her in her
loving service to the little one, and to them.

Lie down a bit, missis, you will be
worn out," she would say ; " I will carry
her about." And so she took her turns to
pace the chamber floor with the child in
her arms, to relieve the anxious father and
mother ; composed in demeanour, woefully
troubled at heart, her household work a
minor consideration.

And when, in spite of science, or skill, or
care, or loving clasp, the child was gone

and the parents' hearts were desolate, she,
whose own sad bosom had found a place
for the winning little blossom, set herself
to comfort and tend the afflicted mother,
who had been sorely overtaxed with packing
before the sick-watching and sorrow
began, and broke down utterly after the
funeral.

Sickness in a well-appointed house, withall
appliances at hand and in order, is a
trial to the patience and endurance of the
attendants. What must it have been in
the dismantled villa where linen and most
of the smaller moveables were stowed away
in boxes and packing-cases ! It was a time
to try the mettle of Bessyy, and well she
stood the test. Her self-command was
invaluable, her power of self-sacrifice was
proved.

It was at first thought that Mrs Cowper
would not be able to bear the journey, and
that her husband, whose presence in London
was imperative, would have to go on
in advance alone. But, disregarding the
dictum of the doctors, Mrs Cowper braced

herself up for the effort, and after a few-days'
unavoidable delay they went together,
Bessyy with them, a tried friend as well asa
servant ; and when Mr Cowper, who had
small time to spare, hired a trap to drive
from place to place, and house to house, set
down on agents' lists, Bessyy had her seat
at the back, and thus saw more of London
and its suburbs than otherwise might have
been possible.

The bustle and excitement of house-hunting,
unpacking, and partial refurnishing,
left Mrs Cowper no leisure to brood
over her loss ; but she was not strong, and
Bessyy saw it, and wherever it was possible
exerted herself to save her mistress.

It was well for that little woman she
then had new surroundings, for her connections
were far away, and she was, of
necessity, left much alone.

In London, however, Mr Cowper had
friends ; they had therefore many invitations
abroad, and kept more company at
home ; but Bessyy would have no helpers.

"No charwoman or hired waiters forme

! I did without them at Mrs Price's,
where there was a tribe of rude children to
hinder one, and I can do without them
here," she maintained. " Besides, I don't
care to be responsible for another person's
care or honesty. If something were lost
or broken I should feel as if I might be
blamed. I would rather by half do the
work myself."

And she did, and that without apparent
effort ; was never in a bustle, never untidy
or grimy.

It ores without telling that her wao-es
were again advanced, but it was not
greatly ; she did not seek it, and wages
had not reached their present rate.

About eighteen months went by. Mrs
Cowper had been consoled by the advent
of a baby-boy, at whose christening there
were grand doings, and Bessyy had her
hands full ; she got through without any
feverish haste, and more than one of Mrs
Cowper's feminine guests envied her the
possession of so neat and capable a
domestic.

But before the child could well run about,
and whilst all seemed smooth and calm, a
letter came to Mr Cowper bearing the
Broomwood post-mark. It came from a
stranger — Farmer Ashtead — and enclosed
another for Bessyyyy. The one to Bessyyyy
begged her return home immediately, asher
father had been taken suddenly ill, and
that was written by Reuben. The outer
letter, marked private, desired Mr Cowper
to allow Elizabeth Birch to return home
without delay, but on no account to let her
know the full reason, which was that her
father, in a fit of delirium, had hanged himself
in the barn. The letter went on to
say that all the neighbours were full of
sympathy for the widow and her family,
who were well - conducted and well-esteemed
; and it ended with a suggestion
that Elizabeth should be gradually
prepared for finding her father dying or
dead.

Oh," said Bessyy, " I know it is something
very bad, or the letter would have
come direct to me.

Yes, my dear, it is very bad," said her
mistress, with her own eyes moist ; " your
father has injured himself, and is not expected
to recover."

Then Bessyy burst out into self-reproaches,
for coming to London in contravention of
her mother's wishes ; and was not to be
consoled.

Oh, my poor mother," she cried ; " to
think she should not have one of her own
girls with her at such an hour."

A new thought then struck her.

Oh, ma'am, and what will you do, left
without a servant, and with baby to be
nursed, — oh, dear, dear ! "

Never mind me, Bessyy, you will becoming
back soon."

Oh, no, ma'am, I shall never leave
mother to come so far again. But, my
dear missis, if ever you should go back
to Brassington, wherever I may be, I will
come back to you if you write for me."

Whilst she had been hurriedly putting
the rooms in order, collecting her belongings
and packing them, Mr Cowper had

obtained her a railway pass, and had a cab
waiting at the door when she was ready.
And he himself saw her and her lucraaQre
safely off — a sure token of the respect in
which this servant-maid was held.

In a few weeks came a letter from Bessyy
with the sad details of affairs at Birch
Farm. Her father had died without will.
Reuben, who had been privately married
to Emma White for six months, had "put
his mother to her thirds," so the farm and
stock would have to be sold. It was valued
at no more than twelve thousand pounds,
so much had it lost in value through her
father's negligence and abuse. Jim had
carried out his threat, and enlisted only the
week before his father hanged himself,
Matty Ashtead having refused him pointblank.
She added that Matty had turned
up her nose at his offer, and said she would
scorn to marry the son of a drunkard
like his father," and that it was supposed
Ralph Birch had been taunted with this
after his son's enlistment, when verging on
delirium tiens, and, adding to its horrors.

remorse had prompted the last dread act.
She said, too, that her sister had come home
for the funeral, but seemed unsettled, and
was not likely to remain with them long.
She had left Mrs Leeke some time. The
letter wound up with Bessyy's intention to
stay with her mother, but coupled with it
was the proviso, " unless you should return
to Brassington, and wish to have me with
you, when I would be sure to come."

She did not say in her letter why Sarah
had left Mrs Leeke, but Mrs Cowper already
knew. It was the old story ; flirting
with the workmen, too much dress, and a
tendency to stay out late, in part ; but, as
Sarah had herself predicted, it was a
bother about the chip money " which
had finally caused her to throw up her
situation in a huff, and so avoid dismissal.

Mrs Leeke's version of the affair was
given with much indignation, but to one
who knew anything of Mrs Leeke's character
and habits, it was easy to read
between the lines.

Leeke's manufactory occupied an extensive

block of buildings, in a wide street in
Brassington, which was devoted to manufactories
of one kind or other. The entrance
was through a wide, tunnel-like
archway, closed at night with a large pair
of gates. The house, which adjoined this
passage, was but a small portion of the
pile, as it were, a mere scrap in a corner
elbowed by the business, which seemed to
grudge house room to the family who had
made it. The kitchen jutted out from the
back of the house, and formed one side
of the enclosed yard, through which the
workers in wood or iron passed to and
from their daily labour. For the girls who
worked above stairs, there was another
entrance. It was in this yard the refuse
wood was thrown, at the foot of two tall
trees, that, in their struggle to live, seemed
to gasp for breath, and look down in
amazement at the growth of brick and
mortar, glass and iron, that had covered
up and crushed out the green expanse in
which they had been planted a century or
two before.

VOL, III. F

It was a busy place ; someone always
coming and going ; and no one was more
busy, active, and energetic than Mrs Leeke.
She was shrewd, keen at a bargain, " close-fisted,"
some people said ; but that she was
viol If she saved narrowly, she spent
liberally. But she was an eagle-eyed
superintendent of the workwomen, who
thought her ubiquitous, — a couple of doors
in a back bedroom of the house enabling
her to make a circuit of the premises at
unexpected times.

Coming and oroins^ thus, she was in and
out of the kitchen as elsewhere, taking in
at a glance more than others in a studied
inspection, — from the joint before the fire,
the rising dough in the bread-pan, the
washed or unwashed crockery, the piles of
copper on the window ledge, to the diminishing
chips in the yard, and the occupation
of her handmaid.

There is no question that she was suspicious
; most overlooker of work people are
their very occupation engenders suspicion
: and when she found the kitchen

empty, she naturally gave a keener glance
at the window and wood heap ; as sharp
over the pence as if they had been pounds,
as Sarah told her, when they came into
collision.

Her frequent absence from the kitchen
was first noticed, then objected to.

I can't be in all places at once," said
Sarah. " I was making beds," or " I was
at the bakehouse," or " at the mangle," or
sweeping the stairs," — always a ready
excuse, even when found by Mrs Leeke
loitering at the gate with one or more of
the workmen. In her impatience of rebuke
she would clear up and rid off her work
with uncommon celerity, to make up for
lost time ; but breakage was often the
result, and the consequent displeasure of
her mistress.

More than once it struck Mrs Leeke
that the firewood diminished faster than
the piles of coin increased, and calling
Sarah's attention to this, had been told
she hadn't "got the money; people
allowed to help themselves might take

more than they reckoned for," and she'd
something else to do than watch them," or
shillings are not as big as pennies, and
I've given change," or " Bill Buck paid for
his last load with silver ; " and the silver
being there, this passed. But it so happened
that three piles of copper were in
the window when Mrs Leeke was in the
kitchen at four o'clock in the afternoon,
and when she came through an hour later
for her tea the tray was set, but neither tea
nor toast ready, Sarah was not within hail,
and two of the three piles of copper had
disappeared.

No silver had taken their place, and
there could be no mistake this time.

Sarah was found, not as usual in the
gateway, but propping up the post of the
house door, in converse with " a stamper"
from the next workshop, with her back
towards the gateway, so that anyone might
come in or go out unobserved.

There was no doubt that the unwatched
piles of copper had proved too great a
temptation to some one of the ragged

urchins who had come for " a basket of
chips," and as little doubt that frequent
pilfering had gone on before in Sarah's
absence.

Sarah was always ready with an excuse.

The tailor's boy brought home master's
suit of clothes. I was bound to eo to the
door when he knocked. I wasn't away
three minutes."

You were away twenty minutes," said
her mistress ; " and you might have kept
your eye on the gateway to see who came
in."

I haven't eyes in the back of my head,
like some folk," was the impertinent answer,
" and I haven't a pair to leave in the
kitchen whilst I go out of it, and I should
like to know how my work would get done
if I never left it."

There's a time for everything," said
Mrs Leeke.

Ay, and a place for everything ; and
I don't think the place for that money's
the window-ledge, tempting poor folk who
come to pay pennies for chips you'd give

'em, if you wasn't as keen over a penny as
over a pound. Father never charges poor
folk for a sup of milk or a bundle of sticks,
bad as he is. And I'm not going to stay
where money is left about for light fingers
to lay hold on, and me expected to keep
count, so you'd best suit yourselves."

I will suit myself, you impudent baggage,
and you may think yourself well off
I don't send for a policeman and give you
in charge, for this is not the first time the
money has gone, and how am I to be sure
you had not gone to the front door as a
cloak ? "

Sarah stood aghast — that her honesty
could be impugned had not occurred to
her.

Fortunately her master had come in for
his tea during the altercation, and he put
in a word, arguing for the girl, that the
window-ledge was no safe place for coin
whilst the door was left open ; that it was
a temptation to the poor, and that he did
not question her honesty ; but he agreed
with his wife that Sarah was too ready

with her tongue, too negligent of that
which was left in her charge, and that for
her oivn sake she would be best in a place
where there were fewer men about to
waste her time with, to her own discredit.

It was not a good character to leave a
second place with ; for, though no allegation
of theft had been made, doubt there
certainly was, and a loud-voiced altercation
carried on with open doors must float like
drift to the passers-by.

She did not readily obtain a fresh situation,
and, when she did, threw it up as too
dull. There was no young family, no other
servant as a companion ; her mistress never
entered the kitchen, or held any communication
with her respecting aught but
her domestic duties. There was little
company, and Sarah, who cared neither
for books nor needlework, missed the life
and excitement of the manufacturer's open
kitchen. She was on the look-out for a
fresh place, when she received her summons
home.

Three more years went by, during which

the Cowpers remained in London ; and
then, the railway being completed, they
returned to Brassington.

Strangely enough, they became near
neighbours of Mrs Price, who still lived
at Laburnum Villa, and, according to Mrs
Amoryy, changed her servants every month
or two. This she heard when applying to
the civil confectioner to recommend a nurse
for her two children.

The Cowpers had not been long settled
in their new residence when Mrs Cowper
chanced to meet Mrs Price at the house of
an old and familiar friend, a Mrs Fielding
a woman of advanced years and of benevolent
heart and aspect.

They were not on ceremonious terms ;
and when Mrs Cowper entered the drawing-room
unannounced, Mrs Price was holding
forth on the subject of servants, and
animadverting on the conduct of the class
in general, her own " plagues " in particular.


Mrs Cowper would have retired, but at
a sign from her friend took a seat, and

listened whilst Mrs Price detailed the
insolence of a maid under whose abrupt
warning " she was then smarting. She
had come to Mrs Fielding for consolation
and advice.

If she did not get the former she got
the latter, and from a little-looked-for
quarter.

Some years had gone by since the
*' woman in the grey woollen shawl " had
called upon her ; she did not recognise
Mrs Cowper in her fashionable light summer
costume, and she was so engrossed in
her subject that the entrance of a stranger
scarcely served as an interruption.

It was rather a shock to her nerves
when the stranger broke in upon her
tirade with, —

Pardon me, Mrs Price, if I venture to
dispute your position, and to hold that
servants, as a rule, are pretty much what
their mistresses make them.' There are
exceptions, of course — strong exceptions ;
but, I say, as a rule, and I do not speak
without experience. My mother, and my

mother's mother, kept their domestics for
long numbers of years, unless they married
and went away to homes of their own, and
even when married they were not lost
sight of, and still retained an affection
for the family in which they had been
trained. And why should wee, in this
generation, have more difficulty in binding
our domestics to us ? Have you tried it ?
I have. I have even tried with success
and non-success the waifs from a London
Night Refuge. I had a terrible experience
with one or two pilferers and confirmed
drunkards ; but I persevered, and by the
power of kindness and patience I happily
restored two good members to society ; one
went to another service and kept it respectably
; the other, a high-spirited woman on
the verge of desperation and suicide, remained
with me until she married honourably
an upright man. A little kindness, a
little forbearance, and some womanly sympathy
were all that was needed to save two
human lives — it may be, save two souls. I
was well served, and they were well saved."

Oh, my husband would never have
such wretches in his house ; he is so very
particular," jerked out Mrs Price.

So I am aware. Did you ever find a
quantity of soda and blockhead on a shelf
after a girl named Bessyy Birch quitted you
to serve ' a woman in a grey woollen
shawl ? ' "

Yes, the impertinent muzzy ! I told
her to use them for the paint and the frigates."


The maid, madam, was wiser and
more economical than her mistress," said
Mrs Cowper, very quietly ; " she knew
that soda destroys paint, and that too
much blockhead clogs the stoves and refuses
to polish. She produced a better
effect at less cost of labour and material,
and, let me tell you, for your information,
that no better or more faithful servant
ever entered a family than that young
woman of whom you, Mrs Price, gave so
indifferent a character to vie!'

You ! " exclaimed Mrs Price, her eyelids
raised in amazement.

Yes, to me. And perhaps I may as
well add that her companion Ann is in
my service now."

Humph ! " But Mrs Price was not
to be put down. " Then, good as Bessyy
was, you must have parted with her, for
you said you only kept one servant."

Mrs Cowper smiled.

You have a good memory, madam ; I
did say so, but I have occasion for a
second maid now. Yet I had to part with
Bessyy, and did it most reluctantly, for
the woman had not had enough of her.'
She, who was said to be ' anything but
fond of children,' made a pet of my child,
and shared with me the anxious watching
and nursing of the darlings in her last illness,
gave us love-service, night and day.
She watched by me, too, Mrs Price, when
I broke down after it. Need I say that
when we removed to London, Bessyy accompanied
us, or that we valued and
trusted her. Her father's sudden death,
by his own hand, necessitated her return
home. She left with a promise to return

to me if ever we came back to Washington."


But she did not, I suppose ! " with a
slight sneer.

I returned in May, and wrote to herat
once. A very hearty and pleasant letter
came back in answer. She would have
come to me with the greatest pleasure, she
said, but an old sweetheart, having a large
sheep-farm in Australia, had come back to
England for her. They had been married
in March, and were on the point of sailing.
Her mother and sister were going
out with them. It was a most affectionate
letter, Mrs Price ; I should like you to see
it. It might show you how invaluable a
treasure you had in your own keeping, and
flung away. Flung away, too, with reckless
disregard what became of it. And
perhaps it might convince you that servants
have hearts as well as hands, and
that servitude is often as much a matter of
feeling as wages. A mistress is responsible
before God for the well-being of her domestics,
and a good mistress makes good maid."

Mrs Fielding here broke in.

I am glad to hear you say so, my
dear ; so many mistresses now-a-days
ignore their own responsibilities. They
expect everything from their domestics —
render nothing ; nothing, that is, but what
is in the bond — wages, shelter, food ; but
of motherly care and supervision, or interest
in their well-being, their joys and
their sorrows, nothing, literally nothing.
A case in point. The very sister of your
Bessyy Birch was recommended to me by
sensible Mrs Amoryy, as a good servant,
but a silly girl, likely to drift to destruction
if not upheld by a firm, kind hand. I took
her with a character that might have deterred
me. I found that she had been
left to her own guidance in a great measure,
had been in service where, so long as she
did the prescribed work, no care for the
welfare of her soul or body, for her comfort
or rational recreation was shown. She
was thrown among shorten and workmen,
yet forbidden to hold converse with one or
the other, or to have a sweetheart to visit

her. She was fond of gay colours, but was
forbidden to wear them. All the beauty
was taken out of her life, and her temper
grew ugly. I had some trouble with herat
first, but I won her heart with a pretty
kerchief, and I was soon her best friend.
A very different girl is the Sarah Birch who
has gone to Australia with her worthy sister,
Mrs Ashtead, and the one for whom Mrs
Amoryy bespoke my good offices. She quite
repaid my care with her zeal in my service.
Yes, Mrs Price, you may take an old
woman's word for it, kindly consideration
for your dependants is a good and safe
investment, if it is nothing more."

Oh ! " cried Mrs Price, who did not
relish the rebuke, " there are servants and
servants ! "

Ay, and there are mistresses and
viisti^esses^' was the pointed rejoinder of
the elder lady.

Mrs Price was answered.

CHAPTER I.

THE Bone-lace COLLAR.

N the broad seat of the mulHoned
window of her Aunt Dorothy's
Having-room, or "house," sat
Isabel Raine, with a cushion on
her lap. The cushion was stuck full of
small, upright pins, not here and there at
random, but with method, as guides for an
ingenious device, to form which the worker
was laying or twining amongst them, first
one and then another of the many fine linen
VOL. in. G

threads, separately wound on small bone
bobbins, which hung suspended over the
sides of the cushion, and which changed
places with every turn of her deft and
slender fingers.

The, window-seat, which likewise did
duty as a locker, served to fill up the
recess formed by the thick stone walls, and
she occupied it, with her back supported
by the wall and her limbs extended along
the seat beneath the window. Thus the
light fell through the small leaded panes,
fully upon the cushion on her lap, and the
casement between the two stone mullions
being thrown open and hooked back on
account of the heat, she had a clear view
before her whenever she chanced to raise
her head from her delicate work.

It was not a very extensive view ; a high
bank, golden with gorse, was the limit
across the narrow road and intervening
forecourt ; but as she was seated, Isabel
could see, not only the flower-beds and the
gate of the cultivated court, and the beehives
against the farthest wall, but over

that low boundary wall of cemented stone
she could look down the dusty lane on
chance passers-by, though even then a
clump of envious trees and bushes blocked
the view and shut out the stone stile and
the footpath through the fields. And,
perhaps, had the hollyhocks and sunflowers
not been so tall, her range of
vision might have been wider.

Her back was turned to the farmyard
gate, as if she had no interest in sheep-folds
or cattle-sheds, stacks or granaries, heard
no music in the clinking of cans or the
clucking of poultry, or in the voices which
at times were wafted thence through the
open casement along with the hum of the
bees and the perfume of flowers and aromatic
herbs, amongst which those busy
workers were so busy.

But never a busier bee was there than
Isabel Raine, for though her dark grey
eyes did cast a glance now and again up the
road, there was no pause in her work ;
the bone bobbins were lifted and shifted,
the threads were carried between and about

the pins, and the lace grew under her
skilful manipulation.

In those days, when Charles the First
sat on his most uneasy throne, fashions
were as various as the opinions of the
people, and many were the gradations
between courtly extravagances in attire
and the primness of the Puritans.

Though an orphan in the care of Dame
Dorothea Sibley, Isabel Raine was well
provided for, and would carry a nice little
dowry to the man so fortunate as to win
her ; but she had not encased her graceful
throat in a stiffly-starched ruff, or distended
her skirts with an unsightly farthingale, and
she kept silks and satins for holiday wear.
Tightly fitting were sleeves and bodice, full
and ample the folds of the glossy, murrey-coloured,
open, linen skirt, and of the
lighter-tinted under one ; snowy white the
lawn of the coif which imprisoned her
raven tresses, of the cuffs at her wrists, of
the collar or kerchief which modestly
covered her neck, and met in a point on
her bodice, and of the long apron which

fell almost to the edge of her gown. Buta
bow of pink ribbon as a breast-knot, and
an edging of the new bone-lace * on coif,
collar, cuffs, and apron asserted the maiden's
claim to something of gentility, if they did
not indicate a desire to look attractive in
someone's eyes. Whose ? was an undecided
question, though her Aunt Dorothy
had a shrewd guess.

She, the widow of a well-to-do Yorkshire
yeoman, who carried on the farm for her
two sons, or rather helped her eldest son
to carry it on, was even then debating the
point in her cool buttery, which, situated
in a side gable, overlooked a field-path on
the north, beyond their own boundary
wall.

She had a basket, covered with a fair
homespun linen cloth, before her on the
stone table under the lattice window, into
which she was counting eggs for the Leeds
market. The clear notes of a well-toned

Called bone-lace from the pins and bobbins of bone
used in its manufacture, and, at a later period, known as
cushion-lace.

voice came rinorinof through the air, and
Dorothy Sibley lost the count of her

ecrcrc.

Who is Sylvia? What is she
That all swains commend her?
Holy, fair, and wise is she ;

The heavens such grace did lend her
That she might admired be."

"&'

Well did the good dame know the voice
of the singer, and well did she know the
smart doublet and hose, and the turned-up
hat, with feather and broad-laced band, of
handsome Master Denton, drawing nearer
with every line of the ditty, and anon
visible from the lattice as he trod the
field-path towards the stile with a firm,
free step, and an easy, not to say assured
gait, his sword swinging at his side.

Ay, there he goes, singing his playhouse
sones! I marvel what the wench
sees in him ? He's not fit to hold the
candle to our Rube, He may have
gathered a few courtly airs and graces on
his travels, but it's much to me if he has
not gathered more ill than good."

So saying, she left her eggs behind in
the buttery, and marched off to the "house,"
her white pinners flapping as she went, and
barely waited to reach the door before she
cried out, in a tone of displeasure, —

Here's that Dick Denton again. It's
quite time that thou made a choice among
thy wooers, Isabel ; and the sooner thou
sends that springald about his business the
better. If he would look after the land
his father left him, like our Rube, instead
of singing and swaggering about, I'd say
naught in his disfavour. But Rube says
he'll not have him comings to the farm at
all times and seasons."

"Ay, Rube says. It is always Rube!"
answered Isabel, looking up from her work.
Master Denton's father was my father's
fast friend, and to the last my father had
a hearty welcome for the son."

Ah ! " exclaimed the dame, smoothing
down her linen apron ; " but Master Denton
has changed, and not for the better,
since he became his own master. But I'll
neither make nor mar. I only say it's

time thou made up thy mind, between one
or t'other."

I shall have made up my mind when
I have finished this bone-lace collar."

Bone-lace ! What has that to do
with — But here he comes."

And the dame bustled back to the buttery,
not in the most amiable of moods,
though, to do her justice, she meant well
by the maiden in her charge, and was anything
but a meddlesome or ill-tempered
woman.

"Is she kind as she is fair?

For beauty Ives with kindness ;
Love doth to her eyes repair
To help him in his blindness."

The song had heralded the singer without
the aid of Dame Sibley, and the eyes
uplifted from the cushion during the foregoing
colloquy could not fail to see the
gentleman as he emerged from the screen
of bushes and came honor the lane towards
the gate with the ease of one sure of his
welcome.

What had her aunt said that caused

Isabel's head to drop over her work
again, as if in deep consideration ? Was
she asking herself if the change noted by
the dame was a change for the worse or
better? It was a question that needed
thinking out.

The latch clicked, her head raised, the
song stopped abruptly, the gold-laced hat
was doffed with the grace of a courtier, the
Good-morrow, Mistress Isabel, how fare
you ? " came through the open casement
sweetly as the song, and in another minute
Master Denton stood with her hand in his.
on the rush-strewn floor of the house — and
thinking was postponed.

The cushion, with its unfinished lace,
had gone abruptly into the window-seat
locker.

Where is Penelope's web ? " asked
he, looking round ; •' is it not yet complete
? "

He had seen her bending over it as he
came up the lane.

Not yet," she answered, seating herself
in a straight-backed oaken chair, as a

hint for him to do the same. " I am
weaving the hopes and expectations of
a Hfe into the lace ; it is not to be hurried
over lightly. Patience and thought and
care need accompany every change of
the bobbins ; else the pattern may be
marred."

And it was clear she spoke with a double
meaning.

More than one life hangs on your
threads, fair Mistress Isabel ; and it is
cruel to keep true love so long unanswered.
But, methinks Dame Sibley has
sharp ears beneath her pinners, and that I
would say to thee should reach no ears but
thine. Prithee, put on thy dainty hood to
guard thee from the kisses of the sun, and
come with me for a stroll by the cool
waters of the beck for half-an-hour."

There was a momentary hesitation, and
then the maiden's French hood, which
covered head and shoulders both, was
reached from a peg, and the heavy door
stood open, when in bustled Dame Sibley
once more.

Here, Isabel, if thought going through
the garth, thou might as well take the
buttermilk and leaven bread to Rube and
the shearers. It's ill going with empty
hands."

So saying she mounted on the long
settle which stretched far into the room
from the open fireplace (where a wood
fire was smouldering on the open hearth),
and, reaching a quantity of dried oat-cake
from the bread-flea, or rack, suspended
from the ceiling, she filled a wicker basket
and handed it to her niece honor with an
earthen pitcher of milk, of which Master
Denton at once possessed himself.

Nay, nay. Dame Sibley, let me be the
bearer. Methinks, Mistress Raine's hands
are not formed for heavy burdens, though,
sooth to say, I rarely see them either
empty or idle."

That's as folk think. Master Denton.
If those same hands have never a heavier
burden than a gallon of buttermilk, she
may think well ; and, to my mind, they
might as well be empty as filled with the

vanity of fashioning bone-lace. She has
set half the osiris in Beeston aloof with
their bobbins and cushions."

Nay, good aunt, I only taught lame
Elspeth, and humpbacked Barbara ; and
thou knowest the others took it up
because the Leeds mercers paid so fair
a price for their work."

Well, well ! thou hast ever thy answer
ready ; and if our courtly dames and
gallants must bedeck themselves with
bone-lace and Venice-point, it's as well
the price thereof should come to Beeston
as go to foreign parts. And now be off,
and see ye loiter not on your way to the
sheep-wash."

She saw them pass through a narrow
gap in the wall (formed by two upright
stones, and called a stile) to the garth, or
farmyard, and, when they were out of
sight, turned back from the door ; then
replaced against the whitewashed wall the
tall chair Master Denton had disarranged,
and, taking a survey of the ample apartment,
with its rudely-carved oaken settle,

its huge coffer, high-backed chairs, and
big table, its rafters and its open chimney
where hams and bacon and salted beef,
cured and curing, hung suspended — she
muttered to herself, with a well-satisfied
shake of her shrewd head.

Isabel may go farther and fare worse.
Master Denton may have silver flagons on
his buffet, and so may Master Hodgson ;
and they may carry swords in their belts,
and have lackeys to wait on them, and our
Rube may be only an honest. God-fearing
man, putting his own hands to the plough
on his own lands, and wife of his must not
give her time to lace and gewgaws ; but I
know which house stands the firmest, and
where the wife would have the surest
peace and comfort. The silver may melt,
the lackey grow saucy, the sword cut its
wearer, and the wife sit solitary in her
satin gown ; but godliness and honest
thrift make a warm fireside, and brother
Raine's girl would find our Rube true and
steadfast, though he be not scented like
a civet."

The First Shaw Hat.

He certainly was not at that moment,
and Dame Sibley's wisdom was at fault
when she sent her niece, in company with
Master Denton, to see Reuben among his
sheep-washers and shearers.

PLAITING RUSHES AS SHE STRAYS.

weston— the Yorkshire Beeston
— is now merely a suburb of
Leeds, with omnibuses plying
to and fro, and rows of modern
houses thrusting their more ancient fellows
into the background. Yet in 1630, though
it presumed to call itself a town, it was
nothing more than a long irregular village
straggling up the side of a steep green hill
along the line of the rude pack-horse or
waggon way, which did duty for a highroad
between Huddersfield and Leeds.
Still, it had its Old Hall, its New Hall, its
chapel (in the parish of Leeds), and at one

time, an abbey or friary had crowned the
well-wooded steep. But some ruthless
destroyer had demolished the abbey, and
its very ruins were rapidly disappearing.
For, though most of the dwellings thereabouts
were of the many-gabled 
order, with roofs of thatch, more
than one thriftily-disposed individual had
availed himself of the loose masonry, ready
hewn to his hand, and built for himself and
his descendants a dwellings of solid stone
at a cheap rate.

Such, indeed, had been the construction
of the irregular homestead of the Sables,
which was situated almost at the foot of the
hill, and at no great distance from a sparkling
beck which drained the higher lands
as it took its winding way towards the river
Aire and Leeds, nearly two miles away.

Advantage had been taken of this running
stream to feed a cattle-pond or sheep-wash
in the corner of a field on the
Stonehouse Farm. It was not absolutely
necessary to pass this sheep-wash on the
jkvay from the house to the cool and umbrageous

path by the beck side, but Dame
Sibley had resolved to make it so for her
niece and her gay wooer.

She had no mind that Isabel should
stroll away with Master Denton, unknown
to her son or unseen by him, and he was
down at the wash, sheep-shearing with his
men. She little thought how Rube's
toasted auburn hair, his coarse, homespun
smock-frock (that relic of Saxon ancestors),
rolled up above the elbows to leave his
brawny arms bare and free, would contrast
with the fine linen, the scented curls, the
superfine cloth doublet, slashed and puffed
with satin, the lace-trimmed nether garments,
loose as the open boots, the graceful
hat with its fancy band, to say nothing
of the other's handsome face, and the well-trimmed
beard, peaked in the newest mode.

If she did so think, it was not as a young
girl reared daintily, but as a mother who
thought her son superior to the world, and
as a farmer who saw in his occupation a
guarantee that he would work hard for wife
and home.

VOL. III. • H

As Isabel and her companion crossed the
pasture with basket and pitcher, Reuben
had a great ram bv the horns, whilst his
shepherd held it by the tail and wool, so
strongly it resisted their efforts to souse
and cleanse it in the wash ; other sheep
scampered about the field, shaking the
water from their shaggy sides, others
bleated piteously in sympathy or anticipation,
one lay in the lap of a shearer, and
three or four, bare and bald and white,
seemed lost in perplexity at their own
lightness.

'Twas a pretty rural scene taken altogether,
but Reuben, with his hot and grimy
face, his muddy boots, his wet and greasy
smock, was no more presentable than his
dirty and bearable shepherd ; and when
the resentful ram escaped from their hands
to dry his fleece in a race over the grassy
slope, and he had leisure to observe who
approached, the expression of his face did
not improve it. He turned to Isabel.

Was there never a maid in the house,
that the mother should press thee and

Master Denton into our service ? Rough
pitchers are not for soft hands to bear."
And the hp that said it had a curl as ot
contempt for such soft hands. " Natheless,"
Rube added, " I thank you, Master
Denton, and my kinswoman Likewise."

Nay, thank not me, good sir," replied
the other, whose handsome countenance
held something like a mocking sneer ; " I
but relieved fair Mistress Raine of a burthen.
I rendered service to Phillis, not to
Corydon. And sooth to say, earthenware
pitchers do best suit horny hands."

In his very affectation he had turned
Reuben's remark upon himself ; but if the
truth were told, the carrying of the rude,
red pitcher had chafed his spirit more than
his soft hands. He was too gallant to
suffer Isabel to bear it, but had no mind
to play lackey to boors — and as such he
mentally classed the young farmer with his
men.

Meanwhile Reuben had plunged his
hands in the sheep-wash, dried them
roughly on his smock, taken a portion of

the oatcake and cheese from the basket, and
passed the remainder to his men, raised the
great pitcher to his hips, and, after a long
draught at the buttermilk, passed that on
also : so little ceremony was there observed
under such circumstances.

It was well honest Reuben did not seethe
expression of disgust on Richard Denton's
face as the pitcher went to his lips.
He was spared one twinge of pain ; but
that would have mattered little ; it cost him
so much to see his cousin stroll away with
him under shadow of the trees, and to feel
how inefficient were any words of his to
detain her by his own side.

It is true she looked back with a smile
and a nod that at any other time would have
set his heart dancing ; but he never before
had been taken at such a disadvantage —
never before had felt the superior personal
attractions of his rival.

What possessed my mother to send that
fooling hither with Isabel '^. He so trim,
and neat, and dainty, and I as rough as
Giles or Dan ! Beshrew me, but she's

done me an ill turn now, unwittingly.
What word could our Isabel spare for me
with that gallant by her side, though she
knows I would lay my very life at her feet ?
Young damsels rarely look below the surface,
and what knoweth she of Master
Denton's life whilst in London, that pit of
godless iniquity ? He was a brave comrade
at the butts or at football when a lad,
but he Cometh not back from the town the
staid and guileless youth he went, and I
fear me his gauds and his glozing tongue
are even now beo^uilinor the senses of
the unsuspecting maiden. My chance is
gone ! "

A desponding sigh spoke for the sadness
of his ruminations, as his eyes followed the
hood and kirtle whose owner was so dear
to him, until the last glimpse was lost
amidst the brambles and other underwood,
and he turned again to his sheep-shearing
with a heavy heart.

He was about right. If his last chance
was not gone, it was going.

Pretty Mistress Raine had been daintily

reared in the house of her father, the Leeds
notary, and much as she valued her cousin
Reuben, she could not shut her eyes to the
homeliness, not to say the roughness, of
his habits and pursuits. But she had
never before seen him to such utter disadvantage.


The jealous sparring of the two men had
pointed the contrast between them. She
saw that they mutually despised each other,
and Master Denton threw a feather or two
into the wavering balance of her mind ashe
saw her look back thoughtfully once or
twice. The shafts of his ridicule were light
as the thistledown floating in the air, but
not the less potent for that.

By my troth, a delicate Corydon for
an enamoured Phillis," he remarked, lightly,
as if to himself. " A rare shepherd swain
for a poet's madrigal ! Could munch oatcake
and quaff buttermilk before the nymph
he adores, with barely the ceremony of
washed hands, good lack ! "

Then his musical voice sang out the
opening of an old Yorkshire ballad, —

The child had wonted* in the wood,
He knew neither evil nor good,
The king himself understood.
He was a wild man."

Hitherto Isabel had strayed along in
silence, plaiting and plaiting rushes idly
gathered by the sheep-wash, the subtle
sarcasm filling her ears and brain with
impressions to which she could have given
no name. At last she said a word in his
defence.

Reuben may be rough, Master Denton,
but he is not the wild man. and he knows
evil from good."

He drew nearer and bent his head.
Too rough for so dainty a Phillis as
Isabel to spend her life with. Think you
this busy little hand was ever meant to
carry pitchers of milk or mounds of bread
to clowns ? " and he took possession of it
as he spoke. " I question not the honest
yeoman's fitness for his calling, but I hold
him unfit to mate with such a one as thee.
The thriftiness which lowers a master to

Lived. t ^[atl)ld—■^ basket.

the level of his meanest hind may have
no taint of greed. I say not that it has,"
he added, as he saw her start, " and I
would be loth to do Farmer Sibley injustice
in my own anxiety to win the hand he
craves."

Much more he said during that ramble
by the beck and over the hill, his own
high appreciation of herself being expressed
as much in his fear lest she
should be sacrificed to a man of coarse
and uncongenial habits, as in any over-eager
pressing of his own claims to her
regard.

And she had listened musingly, seldom
putting in an interrupting word, seemingly
as intent on the gambols of a pair of
azure-blue butterflies, or on the braid of
plaited rushes, as on the conversation of
her handsome suitor.

Yet when he was allowed to raise her
hand to his lips on quitting her at the
Stonehouse gate, he was conscious he had
made an impression, and was the more
willing to bide the completion of the bone-lace

collar, knowing that it was designed to
adorn the man of her choice.

Crossing the garth with his arms full of
fleeces. Reuben witnessed his gallant leave-taking
with bitterness of spirit. Flinging
down his load, he bade Giles, similarly
laden, to bear all to the loft, and hastening
into the house by a side door, forgetful
alike of his grimy face, his unshorn beard,
his miry boots, his greasy smock, he confronted
Isabel angrily ere she had loosened
the strings of her hood.

His jealousy had got the better of his
prudence, and he straightway began to upbraid
her for encouraging the approaches
of Master Denton, as an idle and thriftless
coxcomb, who would neither earn nor
spare.

You forget, in your ungenerous haste
to traduce a rival, that Master Denton is
under no necessity to earn, and is too
generous to spare," answered Isabel loftily.
And for his coxcombry, forsooth, I hold
his attire to be more seemly and befitting
his station than the unsavoury garments

VOL. III. I

my farming kinsman thinks it no shame to
come before me in."

Her words stung, but instead of apology,
he retorted : — " A farmer, who would live
by his farm, must not be ashamed to soil
his hands, or to suit his garb to his occupation
; and she who prefers a false-hearted
spendthrift in a silken doublet to a truehearted
worker, who may chance to wear
a smock, is like to rue her choice in the
long run."

Cousin Reuben, your temper outruns
your modesty. A true man would scarcely
overpraise himself, or malign another."

She left the room as she said this, and
he flung himself on the settle, dropping his
head in his hand despairingly.

His mother had been a listener.

Marry ! but thy hot tongue has
settled thy business, now, Rube. Neither
Isabel nor her broad pieces will come into
thy honest hands."

I care not for her gold, mother. And
if her choice had fallen on Master Hodgson,
or any godly man, I could have borne



disappointment. But I cannot see her
fling her Hfe away in silence."

He had, however, settled the business,
as his mother said.

Before another week came round. Master
Denton wore an elaborate bone-lace
Vandyke collar wrought by Mistress
Raine's fair hand, the hand of which it was
a pledge and a forerunner.

"wooed and married and a',"

HEN Reuben Sibley's grandsire
made free with the masonry of
the ruined abbey and built him
a substantial house in lieu of the
tumbledown, chimneyless, thatched cottage
of timber, mud, and wattle which had
served his farming predecessors for generations,
the home of the Denton stood fair
to view, higher up the hill, back from the
primitive trackway — a picturesque, black-and-white
house, with sundry pinnacled
gables, and two stories above the ground-floor,
each overhanging the other. Stables
and other offices lay in the rear. It was

strongly built, with solid beams of oak cut
from the woods around ; nay, it had more
than one supporting pillar deeply rooted in
the soil, and the cross-timbers were not
only quaintly carved, but the spaces between
were filled in with plaster and rubble
that would shame the tricksy builders of
these days.

Save in the hall and the chamber above
it, the windows were small and lattice-pane,
with never a hinge or a slide for
opening to admit fresh air. Mayhap the
air around was then too pure to suggest
the necessity. The chimneys were so
capacious that the occupiers of seats in the
ingle-nook on either side the open hearth
might see the sun looking down, or the
stars, when night had fallen. The chief
rooms were wainscoted, but that woodwork
had been added since its erection in
the early days of Henry VIII., as had also
the wooden screen or spear, which ran
from the main entrance half across the
lower end of the great hall, for privacy and
protection from rude winds.

Then the furniture was of oak, and
massive ; elaborately rather than delicately
carved ; indeed, the legs of some of the
older chairs and tables were, to say the
least, clumpy. As Dame Sibley had said,
there was plate upon the buffet : the great
antique silver salt-cellar was flanked by a
pair of branching candle-sticks and a couple
of fine flagons ; but the floor was carpeted
with rushes, and only in the two chief
apartments did a curtain keep intrusive
sunbeams at bay ; so primitive was the
house in which Richard Denton had been
reared, though its owners had counted
themselves second only to the Bestows of
the Hall.

And such was the house to which Master
Denton's domestics were orivino- a most
unwonted scrubbing and polishing for the
reception of his bride, even furbishing up
the old arms and hunting trophies which
decorated the walls, in lieu of pictures ; a
house in many respects superior to that of
her aunt and cousin.

But Master Denton, who had indeed

brought with him from London other
notions besides a love of gay apparel,
decided that more was needed to fit
Beeston Place for the bonny bride he had
won. So he mounted his roan mare and
was off to Leeds ; and after cheapening
and chaffering at the booths of mercers
and other dealers in the Brigade (a proceeding
which served as an excuse for
spending a merry night or two in the town),
a string of packhorses and men took their
way through Sunset, and up the steep
sides of Bestow-hill, laden with perishing
for the old house — new-fangled luxuries
which had made no small inroad into
Master Richard's purse.

There were damask hanorinsfs for the
best bed, the oaken posts of which were
thick as a lady's waist. There was a
mirror of Venetian glass,* in which the
coming bride might see to busk herself;
there was a carpet of the new English
manufacture — not for the floor, but the

table ; there were platters and dishes of
pewter, to supersede the ordinary wooden
ware ; buck-handled knives from Sheffield ;
and a few silver spoons, to take the place
of the old latten* ones at table ; there
were bowls and ewers of Staffordshire
earthenware, a new set of polished ,
and, moreover, a couple of
daintily-engraved glasses for state occasions.


The introduction of so many novelties
and luxuries into the house of Richard's
forefathers became the talk of all Beeston,
from the hall to the meanest mud hut ; and
the comments were as various as the people
who made them.

Dame Sibley be sure had her say. Asher
gossips on the way from church fed
her ears with descriptions of gorgeous
importations of which she had scarcely a
conception, the contrast between the home
her Reuben had offered to Isabel, and that
which Master Denton was so lavishly
preparing, smote her with a sharp edge.

Brass.

'* Has Master Denton found a pot of gold
that he pours his broad pieces out so freely ?
Surely the home that was good enough for
his good mother might be good enough for
his wife ! " was her cry of indignant irritation.
" The pot that boils so fast is like
to boil over."

Isbel," said Reuben to her, as she was
preparing her own wedding garments, and
he said it with so much grave earnestness
that she could not doubt his sincerity —
Isbel, when Master Denton came wooing
to you with songs and smiles and courtly
phrases, and with a fine house to offer you,
I thought of my own roughness and unworthiness,
and did my best to bear my
disappointment like a man, though it was
hard to see him coming hither day by day
to the one I held as my own sweetheart.
Well, that is past and over ; but I cannot
let you go to your new life blindfold. In
good sooth Master Denton is showing the
store he sets by his sweetheart, in the
lining of his nest for her ; natheless, Isbel,
he is spurring his steed too fast, and it will

behove you to lay a hand on the reins
when you mount the pillion, or both maybe
unhorsed and landed in the mire."

Isabel lifted up her eyes from her seam,
and though her face was crimson, said, as
calmly as she could, " You mean well,
cousin, I know. If there be need I will
take your advice."

There is a still greater need," he replied.
"It is said that Master Denton
only finds his way to church by tracking
thy footsteps. It behoves thee the more
to keep thy feet in the path of righteousness,
and to draw him with thee. I fear
me there will be many temptations in thy
new life, for Master Denton has friends in
Leeds who scoff at godly folk ; but, Isbel,
resist evil, forsake not the truth, and thou
wilt never want a sure friend."

Methinks, Reuben, thy homily savours
of malevolence, and, like thy other advice,
is ill-timed. Master Denton is not likely
to find favour here," she answered, stiffly,
as her needle flew.

You are right ; he is not likely to find

o

favour here. But I have done," said the
stalwart yeoman, who then wore, not a dirty
linen smock, but a sober suit of dark grey,
fashioned by an itinerant " taylor " from
cloth woven by a village " webster," out of
yarn spun on their own hearth by his
mother's fingers, and from wool their own
sheep had supplied.

He was seemly enough in his doublet
and hose, Isabel was ready to admit, as her
eye followed him from the room, and was
an honest, upright man ; but he was too
ready with his advice and his forebodings
of evil, and was not to be compared in anyway
with her Richard, whose very fondness
in providing so bravely for her reception
had served to provoke the envy
and jealousy of her kindred.

"Aunt Dorothy was ever ready to say
that Master Denton wanted my money
more than me ; but well I wot both she
and Reuben count cost and coin more
narrowly than he. They love gold for itself,
he for what it will bring."

But the bridal festivities, which lasted a

week, were barely over before she began
to think those same relatives were not
wholly in the wrong.

It was not merely the lavish extravagance,
which kept the long table in the hall
spread with a continuous feast for all
comers, or the display of his new acquisitions,
but there were fostering strangers
at their board with whom he was needlessly
familiar, and from whom she felt constrained
to hold aloof, notwithstanding the
claims of hospitality, and the duty of a
bride to receive her husband's friends with
courtesy. The silver flagons and the
drinking-horns were filled more frequently
than she thought advisable, and she ventured
on the third day to suggest as much
to Richard.

Why, sweetheart," said he, with a kiss
upon her cheek ; " thou wouldst not have
me niggardly during our wedding feast ?
Our friends quaff to thee and me in right
good fellowship."

But she somehow liked not their brood
fellowship ; and she observed that neither

her Aunt Dorothy nor Reuben liked It
either.

They would fain have left the gay bridal
party at the churchyard gate, then a noble
stone archway, but for the possible chattering
of gossips, and misconstruction ; and it
may be, besides, that good Dame Sibley
had a little of Eve's curiosity to behold the
fine adornments, of which she had heard
so much.

They both thought the great dining-table
made a goodly show with its array of
pewter-platters, with a drinking-horn and
a knife beside each, and a fair linen napkin,
so needful in the absence of forks ;
and the huge joints and pasties attracted
less attention than the silver salt-cellar,
the flagons, and the two Venetian glasses
for the bridegroom and bride.

Yet, reverent. God-fearing people both,
with a strong leaven of Puritanism, they
were more than once shocked by the levity
and profanity of some of the strangers at
the board, and longed for an excuse to
retire.

An unexpected incident, which cast a
sudden gloom over the feast, and checked
for a time the flow of mirth, furnished the
opportunity.

When appetite was appeased, cakes and
confections were handed round by the
servitors, and the bridal-cup, a huge two-handled
vessel filled with spiced sack, was
placed before the bridegroom. From this
Richard took the first draught in token of
his supremacy, then held it to the lips of
his bride that she might sip, as a pledge
that she shared his lot.

It should then have passed round the
board, from hand to hand and from lip to
lip, as a sign of amity and hospitality.

But it so chanced that one of the Venetian
glasses had been displaced to make
way for this great cup, and in handing the
cup to the friend on his right, Master
Denton swept the delicate glass from the
board. It struck against the arm of his
chair, and was shivered to atoms.

It was an age of superstition. Isabel
looked aghast, and so did he. A shuddering

chill swept through her frame, and
seemed to make the circuit of the guests.
The cup circulated amidst whispers and
speculations on what that mischance might
portend.

And whilst Master Denton in his ano^er
cuffed the servant who had simply moved
the transparent glass out of harm's way,
Isabel quitted her seat, and Dame Dorothy
and Reuben rose to depart. What others
regarded vaguely as an omen, they spoke
of as a sign from God.

A few other sober guests followed their
example, and then Richard Denton endeavoured
to hide his chagrin and restore
mirth by a free circulation of the flagon
and bowl.

It was an inauspicious beginning, and
not all his passionate devotion to Isabel
could make it otherwise.

They had not been married a fortnight
before Richard came to her, as she was
examining and sorting the stores of household
napery for rearrangement and repair,
as a good housewife would have

need where careless servants had held
sway.

Sweetheart," said he lightly, " thou
hast gold in thy coffer ; I prithee let me
have thy key. I have outrun my supplies,
and have need of a few coins."

Nay, Richard, the gold is thine now.
I will unlock the coffer."

So saying, she knelt down before the
bulky chest, which had held the wardrobe
of her mother before her, released the lid,
then unlocked the inner box at her right
hand, designed for the safe custody of
valuables in those days when there were
no banks or bankers, and displayed three
or four well-filled bags of coin.

As he was putting forth his hand to
remove the second bag, she remarked :
"The gold is safe here ; had it not better
remain until there is a call for it ? That
thou hast will sure supply thy immediate
needs ! "

"Ay, ay, Isabel; but as it beseems nota
man to come to his wife for that which
is his own, I will e'en take it into my

own charge. But I care not if I leave
thee a score or two of the bright angels*
for thine own uses."

A score or two," she thought, as he
took a chary handful of the coins from the
last bag and held them out to her, " and
there are hundreds in each of those bags ! "
And the caution of Reuben crossed her
mind with an icy thrill.

There was another large coffer in the
chamber, closed with three great iron clasps
and a secret spring. In this she saw the
bulk of her dower deposited. Yet though
he pressed a kiss on her lips ere he rode
off to Leeds that morning, and promised
to be back ere nightfall, she had uneasy
feelings concerning her husband, not to be
so lightly kissed away.

She had plenty to occupy her hands and
mind in bringing that ill-regulated household
into order, and sunset found her still
busy with her maund of napery and her

needle. The o-olden orlow faded from the
yellowing beeches, and the stars came out,
and she knitted in the gathering gloom,
her heart keeping pace with her clicking
pins, but no distant hoof-beat fell upon
her ear.

Maids and men were sent to their beds
in garret or loft, the midnight moon looked
in through the lattice, and still she watched
and waited in an agony of fear. Roads
were dangerous for travellers with well-filled
purses in town or country ; then men
wore swords, and brawls were frequent
and fatal.

She paced the rush-strewn floor in terror,
picturing her Richard gashed and bleeding
in some lonesome lane.

Daylight streaked the sky with amber,
a chilly breeze shook the yellow leaves
from the beeches, rushed through the oaks,
and set her shivering. Soon the birds
were twittering, and the servants were
astir ; and then, when hope had almost
died, the roan mare galloped up with her
master.



He reeled in the saddle and she thought
he must be ill or wounded. She received
a shock when he dismounted, and she discovered
her mistake, but she uttered no
reproach.

That was Isabel Denton's first nights
— not the last by many a score.

RESTLESS FINGERS.

OR a week or two Isabel Denton
had a penitent and affectionate
husband by her side, who
lavished endearments upon her,
sang songs in her praise, and said she was
the " sweetest dame in Christendom." He,
moreover, indulged what he considered a
whim of hers, and took a survey of his
property and affairs, so as to reduce chaos
to order, and calculate means and expenses.
It was not a congenial or satisfactory
proceeding. He flung his ciphered calculations
among the embers, and paced
the sanded floor in irritation, which told

told her what his tongue did not. She was,
however, glad to see that he was roused to
active superintendence of his small estate,
and to the dismissal of one or two superfluous
and peculating servants.

The activity was only temporary, the
energetic spurt was soon over. He would
much rather lounge about, twang a lute,
and sing to her as, distaff in hand, she set
the spindle dancing on the floor as she
spun, or plied needle or knitting-pins, or
twined her bobbin-threads among the pinson
her lace-cushion.

His idle moods interfered sadly with
her personal superintendence of the household,
but she rarely gainsaid him when
he lacked a companion, as she had always
one or other occupations for her hands,
even when she sat in the chimney-nook,
or by the window-seat, where he
lounged, with limbs extended in graceful
negligence.

It may be her very industry was a tacit
reproach to him, for he would bid her lay
her work aside and give her busy fingers

a holiday, or come out for a ramble with
him through the woods or over the moor.

Even then he would complain of her
restless fingers " and her habit of plucking
reeds and grasses and plaiting them
together as she went. So little could he
foresee what these same " restless finders "
had in them.

He made his life monotonous, and found
it empty.

His only remedy was the entertainment
of free-and-easy friends, who made the
rafters ring and his money fly ; or a gallop
to Leeds, whence his return was uncertain.
Isabel's protests were disregarded ; he
laughed at her forethought and frugality,
and more than once told her he " would
have none of Dame Dorothy's parsimony
under the roof of Beech Place."

• • • • « • •

And in this wise had ten years flown
by ; years that had brought to Dame Isabel
Denton not only the common cares of
motherhood, but more than the common
cares of wifehood.

Four living bairns, three girls and a boy,
clustered round her knee and looked to her
for all they had of pleasure, comfort, instruction
— and the time was coming fast when
to her they alone could look for support.

Her golden angels had long been gone,
melted in the wine-cup, rattled away in the
dice-box, bowled away in the fives-court.
His father's hoard had gone beforehand;
and the oaks and beeches had been felled ;
the very acres that grew them had changed
hands ; nothing remained but the old homestead,
and a creditor, of whom she knew
nothing, was clamouring for that.

Master Denton, or Dick Denton as they
called him, had no longer a horse to ride,
or servants to do his bidding.

Only one domestic remained. The
woman who had been his nurse, and who
had helped to nurse his children, a pious
old creature named Keturah, who had done
much to strengthen the faith and the flagging
energy of the over-tried wife.

Lonof ere the gross had worn off her
wedding-gown had Dame Denton acknowledged

to herself the truth of her aunt and
cousin's previsions ; but her pride and her
affection bound her to keep the knowledge
within her own breast. In time, however,
her husband's excesses became too flagrant
for hiding, and when prudent Reuben became
the purchaser of the first field reckless
Richard made away with, there was no
secret to be kept.

She had endeavoured to conceal the
paucity of coin at her own disposal, and the
struggles she had to clothe herself and
children as befitted their station. It was
not until she cut up her own gowns to make
frocks for her girls that Dame Dorothy was
enlightened ; and shook her white head and
pinners* dolefully as they all met and exchanged
salutations under the arch of the
churchyard loch-gate.

Alack ! Reuben," she said to her son,
on their way home, " I fear matters go but
sadly with Isabel and her bairns. Where
will she find raiment for them when her

own kist is empty ? She had better have
been contented with thee, homely as thou
wert."

Ay, mother, but I should then have
missed my Rachel. She is a good wife
and a thrifty, fears God, honours me, loves
us all ; I am well content. As for Isbel,
He who sent the ravens to feed Elijah by
the brook Cherish, will care for her whilst
she walks in His way and leads her
children therein." And there the subject
dropped.

The following Sunday, to general surprise,
no Dame Denton was seen in the
family pew, and she was known to be in
good health. Only old Keturah had charge
of the children, and she was impenetrable
to the questioning of curiosity. But, bribed
by a cake of parkin from Dame Dorothy's
capacious pockets, her grand nephew let out
that " Mother had no hat, father had thrown
it on the fire in a passion."

No hat! and no money to buy a new
one ! Nothing out of which to construct
even one of the old-fashioned hoods. What

was Dame Denton to do for a decent head-covering
?

To keep her children out of mischief, she
had taught them to weave straw and rushes
into Httle baskets. As she pondered the
pressing question of new headgear, she
chanced to have a few straws in her hand,
plaiting them in and out mechanically, as
was her habit when in thought. It was a
long question, and the plait grew in length
as she ruminated. Then she chanced to
give the plait a twist round her finger, layer
over layer.

An idea struck her suddenly. What
would make a pretty basket might make a
pretty and serviceable hat !

The newest hats, as worn by the Puritans,
were steeple-crowned. Without a
word to anyone she twined her long plait
round and round, widening gradually as she
went on, and securing the folds of plait
with thread and needle.

It was not accomplished all at once, but
by the end of the week she had a hat to goto
church in like a respectable dame. She

had found a ribbon to encircle it, and wore
the hat above her pinners as was the
wont.

In these days of many fashions, a novel
headdress attracts attention. Dame Denton's
straw hat was too unique to pass unnoticed
in those days of change and whim.
The ladies at the hall made a journey into
Leeds to obtain similar hats for themselves.
No one had seen or heard of the new invention.
Feminine desire was baffled ;
feminine curiosity and pertinacity were
roused.

The ladies of the New Hall visited once
more the loner-overlooked mistress of Beech
Place to ask obsequiously where Dame
Denton procured her beautiful hat.

The inventive dame coloured. She was
loth to expose her husband, or the straits
which had called that first straw hat into
being.

The invention was a secret," she said ;
"she believed hers was the only straw hat
in England."

A secret ! and rare ! That which she

had said to silence inquiry, only excited a
craving for possession.

Could not Dame Denton procure the
like for them ? They cared not for the
cost."

She would endeavour to do so," she
replied at length ; but they would have to
wait a week or two."

Dame Dorothy likewise came bustling
up the hill, but she went back little or none
the wiser.

Only Keturah was in Dame Denton's
confidence, and she was as close as Master
Denton's spring-coffer.

The hats were made, and sent to the
New Hall by the old nurse, but as a gift.
Dame Isabel had not thought of turning her
new inventive skill to account, though many
a yard of bone-lace had old Keturah already
disposed of privately for the straitened mistress
of Beech Place.

Mistress Hodgson and the food dame
her mother lost no time in parading their
straw hats — " the newest mode," being only
obtainable as a favour, and through the

medium of the lady who had the very first.
The wearers were importuned to use their
interest to obtain other straw hats for their
friends.

Dame Denton was willing to oblige, but
of course " strangers would have to pay."
This was understood, and the busy fingers
of Isabel were at work late and early, whensoever
Master Denton was out of the house,
which was pretty nearly altogether.

Orders came in, always with apologies
for troubling the good dame, and as her
claro-es were commensurate with the monopoly,
she no longer looked with dread to
the future.

But the secret did not leak out until
Richard Denton's creditor put in his claim
for the old homestead and threatened to
turn them all out.

Richard blustered, the children cried, but
Isabel put on her hat, and hurried down
the hill to her old sweetheart and kinsman
Reuben, the homely but true-hearted.

To him she laid bare her difficulties.
The creditor in the house with a mortgage

over all — her home going. She also revealed
that by her own invention of the
straw hat she was privately making money,
and might herself pay off the mortgage
in time, if it were in the hands of a
reasonable creditor.

Thrifty Reuben had always money in
store, and he had a fund of good Christian
principle besides to draw upon.

Back with her he went in his smock-frock,
with a bag of gold in his wallet,
and whilst Richard Denton sat impotently
drivelling and drinking in the
chimney nook, Reuben paid off the mort-ease
and had the deed transferred to
himself.

Now, Isbel," said he, " thou and thy
children are sure of a home. No creditor
of Master Denton's will have power to
drive you forth ; and if, as thou mayest, thou
hast means to earn a livelihood for thy
little ones by a gift thy God has bestowed
on thee, do it boldly and openly, have
neither shame nor secrecy, nor fear for the
result. In the work of thine hands thou

wilt find comfort and honour, and thy children
will rise up and call thee blessed."

He said this as he stood on the doorstep
whither she had followed him with her
grateful thanks.

But," she replied, hesitatingly, " what
about Richard ? He will never let me
earn the money to keep us if he knew.
He would rather fling my work in the
fire."

Would he ? Has he any means of
support remaining ? "

I fear me, no ! "

Then I will break the matter to him.
And fear not, Isbel, to pursue the path
duty points out to thee."

He went back into the hall, where the
children were grouped in a corner, silent
and afraid.

Master Richard, a word with thee
outside ; I have private matter for thine
ear."

Richard, not the jaunty, rollicking
Richard of our first acquaintance, but a
sort of shabby, secondhand make-believe,

rose from his seat, and, albeit with unsteady
gait, followed the sober speaker
into the open air. He was not very clear
about what had taken place. He had seen
good farmer Sibley count out the gold to
satisfy his "rapacious creditor" as he
called him, but he had a vague idea that
Beech Place was his own once more, and
that Reuben had done a generous act.

He was not prepared to learn that
Reuben was the de facto owner of the
place, by right of the mortgage, and that
he would only be allowed to retain his
place there on condition that he so far
amended his ways as to permit his worthy
dame to pursue her way in quiet.

Reuben had already a private debt
against him, and on these conditions he
promised to be a lenient creditor, but on
the least sign of his interference with the
new occupation of his good dame, on which
the family would have to depend, he declared
he would throw him into gaol for his
debt, without remorse, as a duty he owed
to others.

This was a sobering exhortation, for
Reuben was known to be a man of his
word. And between his surprise and his
personal fears, Richard gave the required
promise.

The promises of such men are as soap
bubbles blown by a child.

Dame Denton had taught her two eldest
girls to plait the straw. But she could not
supply the hats as fast as they were called
for. She engaged a young woman as an
apprentice, then another, and another, asher
trade grew and flourished, and the
fashion spread from Beeston and Leeds to
the metropolis.

Many were the annoyances she experienced
from her dissolute husband,
whose idle hands were always too ready
to fling the work of her busy ones into the
fire ; but so long as she found him the
means to spend abroad he was rarely seen
under his own roof, and for the sake of
her growing children she preferred that it
should be so.

History is silent respecting his end, but

of Isabel Denton it is still on record in the
Annals of Leeds" that she was the inventor
of the first straw hat, that she
maintained her large family and dissolute
husband by the proceeds of her industry
and invention ; and, though it does not
say that she was the first to instruct the
girls of Beeston in bone-lace, it does give
to her the credit of founding the one other

CHAPTER I.

r E L L O W- S T U D E N T S.

Between warlike sieves and
academic studies there would
seem small connection ; and yet
to the memorable siege of Leyden
in 1574 do the Dutch owe their celebrated
university. On May the 20th, in
that year, did the Spaniards besiege the
city for the second time, offering pardon
on condition of immediate surrender. But
the tender mercies of the Spaniards were

well known, and the inhabitants resolutely
held out. Ay, though, as the weeks and
months went by, all that could be eaten
was eaten, down to the very dogs and rats,
and bony famine stalked through the city
with pestilence clinging to its rotting skirts.
At length, when the emaciated living had
scarcely strength left to bury their dead,
the lean and pallid populace came clamouring
to Van der Were the Burgomaster,
to give them food or to surrender. The
old man, hungry as themselves, stood
firm.

*' You may eat what is left of me," he
cried, "for I have no bread to give ; but I
will not yield up my trust."

Prior to that, two white doves of promise
had come fluttering into the city with the
news under their wines that the Prince of
Orange was sending a flotilla with provisions
for their relief ; but the waters were
low, the wind adverse, and from the tall
city tower, or Burg, the boats could be
seen in the distance, unable to reaction them
over the long banks of sand. As a last

resource — for it meant inundation and ruin
to the surrounding country — the relieving
party cut the dykes. Alas ! the waters
only rose a few feet, and the boats still
could not come in.

It was then that the people, in their
hopeless agony, rushed to their brave
Burgomaster ; and the Spaniards, securely
entrenched behind ramparts like bloodhounds
in the leash, chuckled as the cry
of maddening despair rose from the beleaguered
city.

Then, too, as if to prove that '' man's
extremity was God's opportunity," came
a sudden change of wind bringing in the
rising tide ; then, as the north wind rose
to a storm, the billows rushed over the
sands higher and higher. In at the opened
gates, on the 3d of October, came the welcome
flotilla ; and over the Spanish ramparts,
over the Spanish army, went the
waters with a roar. As if to make this
deliverance more signal and providential,
in three days the wind changed and the
waters retired. They had done their appointed

work. The city was delivered,
the enemy destroyed.

What the people of Leyden had suffered
in those months is not to be told in so
slight a sketch. The prince, to mark his
sense of their heroism and endurance,
offered, in perpetual commemoration, either
to remit taxes or to found a university.
And to this day Leyden University exists,
a monument and testimony to the patient
endurance of her ancient citizens, and of
their honourable choice.

It boots not here to attempt a calculation
of all the learning enshrined within its
ancient walls, nor to enumerate the wise
and learned men who have come forth from
its venerable gates — though our Evelyn
and Goldsmith were of the number ; for
this story of ours concerns a student of
later days, one who was neither particularly
wise nor overpoweringly learned.

Hendrick Meulin was just one of those
average young men who are sent to college
to complete their education as a matter of
course, not because they have shown any

special desire or aptitude for any one branch
of scientific or classic lore, and who might
have been kept nearer home to better
purpose.

He was an only son, and was content to
be so, since he had a monopoly of parental
affection, his patrimony was secure without
any necessity to labour with head or with
hands, and he had neither care nor anxiety
for the future.

Stay — one anxiety troubled his breast —
the sort of anxiety most men have felt at
some period of their lives — he had fallen
deeply, desperately in love, and was in as
much trouble about the result as one who
stood so well with himself could be.

It may be he estimated himself by his
inches, and they were not few ; for nature
had gifted him with magnificent proportions,
and added a handsome face to the
fine figure, and an easy bearing which had
almost a dash of recklessness in it.

He had certainly a face and figure to
attract ; and so thought and said Mynheer
Meulin and his good vrouw as they sat in

the zomerhuis of their garden near Delft,
and talked of him and all he was to achieve,
and the ofreat match he would be sure to
make, whilst he smoked, and she knitted,
and both placidly contemplated the grazing
piebald cattle, and the windmills working
away to secure the treacherous water in
the dykes from devastating their fertile
lands.

And so must have thought the Dame
Van Sittart, so careful a watch did she keep
over her orphan niece Luthera Van der
Meyer, whensoever they chanced to take
their walks abroad, or when the strips of
lookinor-orjass attached to the windows of

o o

their town house revealed the approaching
form of the young student.

Professors and students many passed
and re-passed the large old house with the
carved front, which, like a venerable dame
disfigured with powder and rouge, had hid
its antique beauty behind successive coats
of the customary gaudy paint. There were
professors and students both, to whom the
door was hospitably open, and so it had

been to Hendrick Meulin ; but of late he
had a suspicion the hinges grew rusty when
he drew near. And, considering that the
pfreen door shut him out from the sweetest
maiden in all Leyden, the suspicion was
not consoling.

The fair-haired, blue-eyed Jonkvrouw
Luthera Van der Meyer was not only captivating
beautiful, but she was also accomplished
and rich. It is superfluous to say
that Hendrik Meulin was only one of her
many admirers ; but he was the one of
whom the wary Dame Van Sittart had the
most apprehension. She was proud of the
homage paid at the shrine of which she
was the custodian ; and so long as the
devotees bowed at a distance, all was well.
But Hendrik Meulin evinced a tendency to
approach too near, and Luthera showed no
signs of displeasure. Nay, she greeted his
coming with a smile, and followed his
departure with a sigh.

This will never do," the old lady said to
herself; " that young man is too engaging,
by half. Luthera is just of the age to betaken

with a face and a figure, and to think
a man carries his heart in his eyes. Ah,
me ! I thought so once ! " and she sighed
as heavily as a damsel of eighteen. " She
is too young to distinguish gold from tinsel
; and — Well, I don't want the poor
child to have my experience. It is best
to be careful."

It is doubtful, however, whether the
Dame Van Sittart could have put her
objections into definite shape, or whether
a want of sufficient deference towards herself
did not call them into being ; or whether
there might not be something more potent
in the background.

It was at the Church of St Pancreas
Hendrik first set his eyes on Jonkvrouw
Van der Meyer ; and it being the custom
in the Dutch Church (as it is still in some
remote English ones) for the women to sit
on one side and the men on the other, she
was full in his sight, and I am afraid had
more of his attention than had the service.

He had gone there shortly after his
arrival in Leyden, as a stranger, partly too



see the building, and the monument therein
of the brave old burg-master, Van der
Werff ; and, having been haunted all the
week by a face unconscious of its own
charm and a form like a fabled sylph, he
found his way thither the following Sunday
to feast his eyes again. A bribe of a couple
of olden obtained her name and that of
her companion from Jan, the servant who
carried the ladies' foot-stoves to and from
the church behind them, and that knowledge
seemed to brings her nearer in his
thoughts. In reality he was as far away;
for though the ladies could not fail to see
him, it was but as one of the congregation,
though he had a notion the blue eyes began
to droop under the gaze of his, as blue as
the fair maiden's own.

The season for furs and foot-stoves was
gone. The trees along each canal and
strait were robed with the delicate green
of spring. Jonkvrouw Van der Meyer had
thrown aside her winter garb and, more
bewitching than ever, turned the young
man's head. He was jealous of every man

who raised his hat or stopped to greet them
in their walks. The summer sun came
down to scorch the red tiles of the pointed
roofs, blister the vari-coloured paint on the
house-fronts, suck up the sluggish water in
the river and the dykes, and dry up the sap
of the green leaves. The storks were back
and busy on the chimney-tops ; but the
bird had flown to whose music he had
listened week by week.

Luthera's voice had been raised in hymns
of praise, without thought of a human
hearer ; but he had felt as if she sang for
him, and he resented her absence as a personal
grievance.

In his moodiness he recollected he had
gone to Leyden for study, and not for falling
in love, and he betook himself to the
Lecture Hall, his books, and his papers, to
recover lost time prior to the examination.

It was a stiff pull, and he had to thank
a fellow-student named Derek Keppel for
his help at the last, or he would have failed
ignominiously, not for want of talent, but
for want of talent's right hand, assiduity.

He told this Derek Keppel it would
have broken the hearts of the good couple
in Delft if the son of whom they were so
proud had not passed. As it was, he went
back to his country-home to be loaded with
encomiums he knew he did not deserve ;
but though conscience gave his tongue
many a twitch, he never confessed how near
he had been to failure, or said a word of
the pale-faced student who had sacrificed
his own rest and valuable time to pull him
through.

In fact, he had more qualms about this
self-same Derek Keppel than he cared to
own, even to himself.

Derek had no father, and his mother
had made sacrifices to give him a liberal
education. He had turned his attention to
engineering, that most essential study in a
land where the engineer plays so important
a part in its preservation, and where the
science has a recognised and prominent
place, if not in the curriculum of its universities,
at least in special schools attached
thereto.

In the memorable year 1830, when
Belgium broke away from Holland, the
students of Leyden took up arms, enrolled
themselves as a corps, marched to the
frontier, distinguished themselves in several
encounters, and for three years remained
under arms.

Derek Keppel had been one of these.
He had gone at his country's call to fight ;
but he had never forgotten that he was
destined for an engineer, or that he was
drawing on limited resources ; and when
others were drinking or smoking or
gambling to fill up vacant intervals, he
was drawing plans and diagrams, and
making calculations, regardless of the ridicule
of his idler and lighter-brained
companions.

Of these, a reckless young fellow, Ernst
Van de Venter, and two others, by name
Zwart and Groen, were the most tormenting
; and as they marched in the same
rank, and were generally quartered together,
there was no avoiding them or
their rude jests. Many of these were

thrown away upon him, for, as he smoked
and studied, his mind became absorbed,
and his ears were closed to the shuffling of
cards, the rattling of dice, or the sneers of
those who smoked, and drank, and gambled
the hours away.

Van de Venter, from the lofty eminence
of an overflowing purse, looked down with
contempt on a scholar who dressed plainly
and was neither to be found in theatre or
cafe, and concluded that only the direst
poverty could drive Derek Keppel to such
self-denial and incessant study. With this
idea he had inoculated Zwart and Groen ;
and that which should have been Derek's
protection was taken as an open door for
banter and mischief.

And this, not merely whilst the corps
remained under arms, but after their return
to Leyden ; when they and others were
still so flushed with the warlike spirit, that
they were ever on the alert to provoke
quarrels for the extreme satisfaction of
settling them at the sword's point.

Many a time had this choice trio burst

into Derek's chambers at midnight, when
the cafes were closed, and forced their unwelcome
society upon him ; and more than
once had they carried with them Hendrik,
to whom they had attached themselves on
his first entrance on the books of the
University.

It was not Derek's desire to quarrel with
his unwelcome visitors, much as their presence
irritated and interrupted him ; but it
was no uncommon thing to find a page of
a thesis he was preparing, or a mathematical
problem which had cost him severe
thought, torn into strips for a pipe-light
or trodden under foot, half-burnt ; to say
nothing of the confusion into which his
papers and letters were thrown. He was
not naturally suspicious, but he could not
regard these repeated mischances as wholly
the result of accident.

He had come back to Leyden with
honourable military distinction and an
extracted bullet in his side ; and in 1834
was still working almost night and day, to
recover lost time, when he so generously



stepped In between Hendrik Meulin and
an utter breakdown.

Generously indeed, for he more than
suspected the young man of destroying an
important memorandum lying on his table ;
but he also ascribed it to the mischievous
instigation of others.

It was the knowledge of this and other
practical jokes in which he had taken part
at the expense of Derek, that made the
sounds of his own praises so uncomfortable
to Hendrik, for the first time in his life.

He had neither honestly earned nor
deserved them. But he did not own
it. Moral cowardice was stronger than
courage.

VOL. III.

M

AT FLOOD TIDE.

CERTAIN class of pottery took
its name from Delft ; and a certain
class, if not so high a class
of delf, is still there manufactured
; but the thriving trade is of the past,
its vitality is at a low ebb, and the quaint
old town is as stagnant as its waters and
its trade. It was not much more lively in
1834; and Hendrik, who had vegetated
there for thirteen years with undisturbed
serenity, was, since his brief Leyden experience,
in an uncommon hurry to flee
from the quiet and monotony still so congenial
to the phlegmatic placidity of Mynheer

his father, and the domesticity of the
rotund vrouw his mother. The short-skirted
maids, with their inveterate rubbing
and scrubbing, clattering of brass pails, sluicing
and dashing of water, certainly created
a diversion on the Saturday ; then Sunday
carried them all to church, and though he
seemed to have lost his old interest in the
slow service, there were friends to salute
outside, and the town was less deserted.
But, oh, the dreariness of Monday to him !

He had heard the history of every plant
and flower in the garden, between the long
whiffs of Mynheer's pipe, as they had
sauntered lazily round and about the winding
walks, he keeping company with a
cigar. Or he had smoked and drunk a
sober o-lass of seneca with his father in the
zomerhuis, and listened alike to the click-click
of the good vrcuw's knitting-pins and
the accompanying details of all the domestic
doings and disasters during his absence,
interrupted, it might be, with Mynheer's
questionings anent his life in Leyden.

At such times he had found it convenient

to make his escape and stroll away towards
the sleepy town, to watch the storks,
and the windmills, and the lazy barges on
the canals by the way, out of sorts with
himself and all his surroundings.

Monday brought matters to a climax.
Mynheer Meulin and his vrouw both had
exhausted their conversational themes.
They expected him to be as circumstantial
as themselves in detailing his career and
his course of study in Leyden for their
behoof. They had reared him steadily,
soberly, piously, and had no suspicion that
he could have aught to conceal or suppress.

He was on the horns of a dilemma ; he
had neither the inventive faculty of Van
de Venter, nor the lying facility of Zwart,
nor the swao-orer of Groen. He could not
make free with the name of Jonkvrouw
Luthera Van der Meyer, and excuse idleness
on the score of frantic passion for a
lady with whom he had never exchanged
a word. He could not tell how he spent
his hours with his rackety friends ; and it
taxed his ingenuity to tell a consistent story

o

of lectures he had never attended, or the
remarks of professors whose lectures he
had not heard, with even a shadow of truth
therein.

As usual, he fidgeted, and, making some
excuse, before long was ruminating at a
distance from the parental dwelling in the
company of a reflective stork, which stood
at ease by a dyke side upon one leg, with
the other tucked up under its wing.

Old sage," said he, apostrophising the
bird, " are you meditating your domestic
and national responsibilities in the worm
and insect line, or are you pondering the
mysteries of your next migration ? If so,
I think I'd better tuck one leg up under
my arm, and stand on the other, whilst I
take counsel with you, Professor Stork. It
is quite time I migrated ; but whither shall
I fly, O bird of thought ? "

The bird, with its long neck bent, and
its head on one side, might have been
listening. Down went the spare leg, out
went the wings, and away high up in the
air the stork was flying westwards.

Towards the sea, eh ? A o-ood suggestion
? I feel inclined to take the hint."

In a few days Hendrik had persuaded
the anxious old couple that his restlessness
could only be cured by sea-air and sea-bathing,
and that he must take them to
strengthen him to face the arduous studies
of the future ; there being for that purpose
no spot so salubrious as Scheveningen.

The old fishing village was not so
fashionable a watering-place then as now,
but it lay between Leyden and the Hague,
and was beyond the range of Mynheer's
spectacles.

Hendrik did feel some strivings of compunction
when the pair, whose only hope
on earth he was, accompanied him to the
trekschuit, in which he was to make part
of the journey, and left him there with
blessings and exhortations, a refilled purse,
and a wardrobe replenished with linen and
hosiery which had occupied the hands and
mind of the industrious vrouw during the
whole time of his absence. He saw the
tears roll down her plump cheeks as she

looked a last farewell when the trekschuit
began to move ; and he resolved for the
twentieth time to keep faith with his confiding
parents, and his promise to Derek
Keppel.

For not only had the engineering student
stepped in between Hendrik and disaster
in the Professor's Hall, but he had endeavoured
to step in between him and associates
who were doing their best, or worst,
to destroy all the good there was in the
young man, fresh from the country and a
quiet life. And if Hendrik did not take
the friendly advice as gratefully as he took
the " coaching " he knew that it was well
meant, and left Derek with a promise to
stick to his studies and avoid his alluring
associates in the future.

The resolution was strong upon him
when he reached Scheveningen ; and there
he had no temptation to break it. But he
was not disposed to saunter alone upon
the broad flat sands and listen day by day
to the unceasing sermon of the sea. It
was his intent to wander through the wood

to the Hague, and round about, peering in
through the gates of chateaux and country-seats,
in the chance of a glimpse of the
vanished but unforgotten Luthera Van der
Meyer.

Many a retiring jonkvrouw was abashed
at the searching gaze of the fine young
man ; many a careful father glared at him
through the smoke of his long pipe, as he
walked leisurely past, or stepped on the
plank-bridge across the private dyke, which
converted every other dwelling into a
"moaned grange," and took a close survey
of garden and house windows through the
gates ; but neither at the Hague nor on
the road thither came he across even a
servant or sign of her for whom he sought.

Returning with his hands in his pockets
along the straight road, in most disconsolate
mood, to the flat but picturesque
seaside village, at the end of a week of
disappointment, too dejected even to
smoke, — for it is your high-spirited fellows
who sink to the lowest depths of despondency,
— he became annoyed by the irritating

barking of a little doo that would follow
close on his heels, frisk around him, spring
upon him, and though more than once
admonished by the said heels to retreat,
returned aofain to the chancre.

It should have been moonlight, but the
sky was about in as cheerful a mood as
Hendrik, and the clouds had the best of it.
Only now and then did the sombre cumuli
let the moon show a clear face. But in
one of these glimpses a light shone on the
dog, and on the man he persecuted.

The clouds from his face vanished too.
Zeiler ! Zeiler ! " he cried ; and as Sailor
answered to the call, the idle hands came
from the pockets to one of the harriet little
Scotch terriers that ever was made a pet of.
How many biscuits had Hendrik carried in
his pockets on the chance of meeting Jan
with the dog, and feeding the latter for the
sake of his mistress !

If he had no biscuits for " Zeiler" now,
neither had he any kicks. He patted the
rough head, asked where he had left the
pretty jonkvrouw ; and when the animal lay

down in the path, and beat its shaggy tail
on the grass-bound sand, as if to say it was
tired, Hendrik bent his long back and took
him lip in his arms. He certainly regarded
Zeiler " as Jonkvrouw Van der Meyer's
representative.

As the lights of Schevenineen came insight,
a party of shrimps and short petticoated
fishermen, with white caps and
sharp eyes, hailed him with —

"Here he comes! Here's the pretty
jonkvrouw's dog ! " " Where did you find
him, Mynheer*" "Oh, the ladies will
be so glad!" "Did you know Jan was
seeking him, Mynheer } "

And before he could answer half the
questions put to him in different voices, a
lad in wide blue woollen breeches ran off
as fast as his heavy wooden shoes and
Dutch stolidity would permit, past a larger
group of people farther along the sands,
and on to the lighted hotel a little distance
beyond.

As Hendrik approached this group of
fishermen and others, he became aware

that they surrounded one of those hideous
exaggerations of the English hall-porter's
black-hooded chair, peculiar to the seashore
of Scheveningen, and that the Dame
Van Sittart was ensconced therein, either
to enjoy the sea-air or the pleasure of rebuking
Jan, who stood with downcast head
before her like a culprit.

You should have been more careful,
Jan," she was saying, " knowing well how
much your young lady loved Zeiler for the
giver's sake. And what will the Captain
say when he returns and hears that she has
lost the Ao<y he brought for her across the
sea ? "

"The Captain!" thought Hendrik, with
a jealous pang, as the wind brought the
raised voice to his ear, " I wonder who he
IS :

But his quick eye had observed a slight
girlish figure tripping down the steps of
the hotel, and hurrying across the sands,
and he had turned to meet her before either
Jan or Zeiler had seen each other. Until
then the weary little animal had gone comfortably

to sleep in the arms of his biped
friend. All at once he roused, gave a sniff,
then a bark of recognition, a restless twist,
and, being released, a joyous bounce towards
the feet of his recovered mistress.

Ach ! Zeiler, Zeiler, where have you
been, my poor pet, all this day ?" she said,
in her sweet tones, to the frisky animal.

Hendrik had doffed his hat ; " Pardon
my addressing you, Jonkvrouw Van der
Meyer, but Zeiler and I are old friends.
I found him, or rather he claimed my
acquaintance, among the dunes about two
miles away. I am pleased to have been
the means of his restoration."

Ach, Mynheer, I know not how I shall
thank you sufficiently ! Zeiler " (the dog
was by this time in her arms, and as lively
as a cricket), " bark your most grateful
thanks to Mynheer — " The pause was accompanied
by a slight interrogative glance.

Meulin, Hendrik Meulin, at your service
! " was his prompt answer, all in a
thrill at the long-wished-for opportunity to
exchange speech with her.

The doo's bark had attracted the occupant
of the sheltering shore-chair. She
joined them at this juncture, and looked
from one to the other, and then at the dog;
but the lii^ht was not strong enough to
reveal faces or their expression.

"Aunt, this gentleman. Mynheer Meu-lin,
found Zeiler two miles away, and has
carried our treasure home in his arms.
Has he not earned our thanks?" And
she caressed the rouo^h black head nestling
her soft cheek, so lovingly that one
of the trio felt envious.

Undoubtedly," said the aunt decidedly,
though in a lower key than her reprimand
of Jan, " and the Captain's thanks also.
But I am surprised. Mynheer," and she
turned to Hendrik, as they all walked on
towards the hotel, " much surprised that
the dog would permit a stranger to touch
him ; " and she looked curiously up at
Hendrik, whose form and bearing seemed
not unfamiliar to her,

Oh, Zeiler does not regard me altogether
as a stranger, Dame Van Sittart,"

said Hendrik, answering her look and
tone, as much as her words ; " we two
struck up a friendship in Leyden some
months ago."

Indeed ! " quoth the elder lady, as if ina
fog.

But the lamps of the hotel shone in their
faces.

I think, aunt' suggested Luthera,
we have seen Mynheer Meulin before.
At church," she added, as a reminder.

The Dame Van Sittart needed no reminder
now they had reached the hotel,
and there was light by which she could see
for herself. She had the courtesy to invite
the young man to enter, but he had
the self-restraint to excuse himself, on the
plea that it was too late to intrude ; and
raisins his hat ao"ain took leave gracefully.
It was an act of policy, and had its
reward.

A polite and unassuming young man,
that. He did not presume on his service
to thrust himself forward, as some do,"
said the aunt, as she toiled up the steps,

"and not an unworthy one, I should say,
he is so regular an attendant at church."

And did you see how Zeiler jumped
out of my arms to his feet, and put up his
paw to be shaken before he went ? Zeiler
is a dog of discrimination ; " and the beauty
caressed the rough head to which the latter
remark was addressed.

Yes ; I would rather trust the dog's
instinct than my own discernment. Yet a
doff will fall in love with one half of a man's
nature sometimes ; the other half may be
warped, yet not concern him."

"Ach ! Zeiler knows better than that. He
is a wise dog, is my pet. And Zeiler likes
Mynheer Meulin ; " and again the rough
black head came in for a caress.

From this scrap of a conversation continued
by the ladies in their own apartment,
it may be seen that Hendrik had made a
favourable impression, and that it would bean
easy matter for him to make good his
introduction without seeming to obtrude.

The sands of a watering-place offer many
facilities for cultivating acquaintance. He

had not been so intimate with Van de
Venter without learning so much. Then
he counted on Zeiler as an ally.

Fifty years ago Parisian fashions had
not altogether banished the national costume
of the Dutch. Jonkvrouw Van der
Meyer still wore the close-fitting cap and
hood, the gold ornaments on brow and
temples now seen only on those of lower
rank, the full skirt of her people ; and
Hendrik thought she never looked more
charming than when he met her on the
sands the next morning with Zeiler for a
companion. The dog came barking and
bounding forward to salute him, scampering
backwards and forwards from one to the
other as if to re-introduce them.

Zeiler seems determined I shall not
pass you this morning, Mynheer," said the
young lady, responding with a smile to
Hendrik's bow and simple salutation, at
the same time putting forth her hand with
characteristic frankness.

Be sure he took it ; and though the little
gloved palm rested in his but a moment,

there is no saying what wild hopes he did
not build thereon. He made inquiries
about the Dame Van Sittart's health. She
had to ask whereabouts and how Zeiler
was found ; and somehow the conversation
lasted looser than an orthodox " five
minutes."

When the morning was well aired, the
aunt came on the scene with her niece,
and Jan in close attendance. A bathing-machine
swallowed up Luthera, and made
Hendrik's approach to the dignified yet
gracious dame all the easier.

Indeed, she had the art of putting those
of whom she approved at their ease directly,
and could repel an intruder quite as freezing.
It suited her just at the present to
learn something more of the fine-looking
young fellow than his name and his seat in
church. Was she not left in charge of a
charming maiden with as charming a fortune,
and would she not have to render an
account of her charge when her brother,
an officer of high rank in the Dutch fleet,
came home from his present cruise ? It

VOL. III. N

behoved her to know to what extent it
might be safe to recognise the Httle service
the young man had rendered.

As it happened, it equally suited Hendrik
to talk of his parents, of their home, of his
only-sonship, and his studentship, as if he
had no ulterior object in view.

At all events the Dame Van Sittart was
satisfied. He was allowed to make himself
agreeable to both ladies ; and so well
had he improved his opportunity that when
they quitted Scheveningen he had an open
invitation to the abode of the Van Starts
in Leyden.

HIS FRIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES.

ENDRIK was elated with his
good fortune. He felt he had
made an impression which he
hoped to deepen ere long, though
his jealousy of the mysterious " Captain "
had not abated when the ladies left him to
the sands and the castles he was building
thereon.

Be sure he was not long in seeking his
own quarters in Leyden ; not much longer
ere he availed himself of the elder lady's
invitation, or the seconding glance in a
pair of blue eyes, which had done something
towards his castle-building.

It was a proud moment for him when
he was admitted under the Van Sittart
roof. He was aware this was an especial
privilege to a young student, even had
there been no charming young lady in
view.

Not only did the Van Sittarts move in
the best society, but the silver-haired
dame was a woman of some culture ;
affected letters ; had a near relative occupying
a professorial chair in the University;
and round the tea stove* in their antique
drawing-room, rich in carving and old
pictures, might be met not only learned
professors and a sprinkling of rising
students, but a select circle of other
friends.

Hendrik was received with cordiality
and smiles, was invited to repeat his visit,
and availed himself of the privilege to the
utmost.

Then Sunday by Sunday they met at
church, and what more natural than the

A china and metal contrivance, holding a small
lamp, above which the teapot rests to be kept hot.

walk home beside them to their own door,
even if not invited to enter ? And what
more natural than the pressure of little
fingers when a hand was committed for a
moment to his keeping as they parted
there, or that the pressure should send
the warm blood mantling to cheek and
brow ?

He had ceased to be jealous of the
Captain ;" he had learned that the much-valued
giver of Zeiler was the absent uncle
of Luthera, who had been almost a father
to her, and who was revered as such.

But he had begun to be jealous of someone
else ; no less an individual than Derek
Keppel, whom he found admitted to the
same exclusive circle, and, as he fancied,
on a more familiar footing than himself.

For himself, he felt assured he was gaining
ground in the affection of Luthera,
and, short of open proposal, had made his
own pretensions very palpable ; but more
than once Derek had come in, been greeted
with a kind word and a smile, or handed a
cup of tea by Luthera herself, and he had

gone off in an ill-disguised fume of jealousy,
leaving Derek to sip his tea and talk to
the ladies or the professors, as suited him
best, and to follow Luthera with his deep-set,
thoughtful eyes, as he was wont to do.

There was always an excuse for his
abruptness to be made by Hendrik to the
aunt, and a very humble apology to be
offered to the niece when next they met,
indoors or out — apologies accepted more
or less readily, as she thought reasonable.

But suddenly it seemed to him that
though Luthera was ever glad and ready
to greet him, that the Dame Van Sittart's
welcome grew colder with the weather,
and, as was said before, the green door
opened less readily for his admittance.

He was not slow to attribute this change
to the influence of Derek ; and his jealous
bitterness absorbed what little gratitude
and sense of remorse was left to him.

The students of Leyden University are
not under the same surveillance as in
Oxford or Cambridge ; they do not live in
their college ; are tied down by no strict

rules ; attend the morning lectures of the
professors, not on compulsion, but of freewill
; and the licence they take in this and
other respects is at times something
appalling.

For the man of studious habits and resolute
will, the path of learning is broad
and open. For the indolent or irresolute,
the path to ruin is still more broad and
open. There is no one in authority to
oppose a barrier ; and young blood is the
same all the world over.

It so happened that his fits of jealousy
had driven Hendrik, not into the solitude
of his own chambers for the studies the
good Mynheer accredited him with, but
into the wild circle of which Ernst Van de
Venter was chief; who, though marked by
their mourning rosettes as students whose
college had lost a man of note, were more
at home in the cafe or the herbert than
the college ; more given to cards and billiards
than books, and drank more beer
and Schiedam than the undrinkable Dutch
water would warrant.

November closed in cold and damp ;
but colder than the weather was the chill
upon Hendrik when he missed Luthera,
two Sundays consecutive, from church ; and
on calling at the house where he had been
a welcome guest, was told, the ladies were
Gone to Amsterdam " — then were " At
the Hague" — and lastly, as Christmas
drew near, and the black head and beady
eyes of Zeiler at a window proved the
presence of his mistress, was informed by
Jan first, that " Master had returned, and
the ladies were engaged ; " and the next
day, they would " be engaged the whole
of the Christmas time."

This is Mynheer Keppel's doing," he
cried in wrath, as the green door closed in
his face once more ; "he shall answer for
it ; " and away through fast-falling snow
he hurried to Keppel's lodgings, losing his
breath, but not his hot temper, as he
mounted the many dark stairs to the small
room where he felt sure to find him — for
another examination was at hand.

Without the preliminary of a knock, he

burst In upon his fellow-student, and demanded
—

What have you been saying of me
to — to — the Dame Van Sittart, that
should cause her door to be closed against
me?"

Derek looked somewhat absently up
from his papers, as if clearing his mind
for the reception of ideas foreign to his
subject, and having given a wandering
glance round his anything but luxurious
chamber, where books and diagrams
were the principal furniture, at length
fixed his clear but somewhat sad eyes
on the irate intruder, and answered
calmly, —

Nothing ; I have had other subjects
for conversation."

Nothing ! " echoed the other. " Do
you mean to say you have said nothing to
prejudice the old dame against me, and so
clear the road to supplant vie with Jonk-
vrouw Van der Meyer*"

A flush overspread the pallid face of
Derek, then left it whiter than before.

He had risen : the hand he rested on the
table, as if to steady himself, trembled :
there was a momentary pause before he
answered, —

I have no pretensions to Jonkvrouw
Van der Meyer. I can attempt to supplant
nobody. The poverty which has
been your scorn, would check any presumption
in that quarter. I have a mother
and sister to think of — if this nasty bulletin
my side does not cut short my career."

Hendrik looked him steadily in the face,
his passion gone.

Derek," said he, " if this be true, —
and I never knew you lie, — you are a
noble fellow, and far worthier of Luthera
Van der Meyer than I. I knozv you love
her, and there have been times in my
mad jealousy when I have thought she
hesitated in her choice between us. I
thought, when Jan closed the door to me
just now, you must have dropped a hint
of my shortcomings as a weight into the
balance, and I came here to have it
out."

Nay," said Derek, more composedly ;
no word of mine was needed. The
Dame Van Sittart has quick eyes and
ears. Your habits and associations have
been openly discussed in her hearing by
professors and others. You have only
yourself to blame. There must be no
shadow of reproach on the man who
would wed Luthera Van der Meyer.
Let me, as a friend, entreat you, as I
did once before, to shake off Van de
Venter and his set. Go at once to your
studies, and work night and day to meet
the coming examination. Success is the
handmaid of endeavour. Let not your
parents mourn the failure of their son.
Pass, and you may reverse the Dame
Van Sittart's opinion. And now leave
me. I have not a moment to lose ; and
you have put all my lucid ideas to
flight."

Hendrik went his way subdued. He did
not see how the pale face he had left dropped
into the thin hands, or the struggle that
shook the slight frame, or hear the student's

earnest prayer for strength to do his duty
manfully, ere he resumed his interrupted
studies — studies protracted far into the
night.

Hendrik's rooms were close at hand ;
unobserved he reached them, and sat down
to his books. But Luthera's name seemed
to dance over the classic page, and send his
wandering thoughts astray. He leaned
back in his chair to think of her, instead of
his subject. Then he filled his meerschaum
and made another effort.

The following mornings him listening
a lecture from Professor Vansittart, intent
as any student in the Hall. And there is
no knowing what unremitting attention
might not have accomplished even at the
eleventh hour. But —

Quiet Leyden was alive. The snow lay
thick on all things — on the trees like winter
blossoms, and the frost was keen. Not
only the citizens and children, but countrywomen
and boers skated along the frozen
water-ways with their eggs, poultry, or other
produce to or from the market ; sledges had

superseded barges and carriages, and the
stream of life seemed to run faster now the
watery currents were stayed.

In passing the ancient Town Hall on
his way from the lecture, Hendrik beheld
Luthera standing with the Burgomaster's
daughter, close to the double flight of steps
leading to the great door of the fine building.
Jan was fastening skates upon a little
pair of feet. His own and another pair lay
on the snow in readiness.

Hendrik's heart gave a great bound.
Here was the chance he had hoped
for.

As he saluted the two jonkvrouws, Lutheraa's
blush and smile told that to her the
meetings was not unwelcome. He drew
her aside, and under the impulse of the
moment told what his hopes had been,
and what a blank the closed door had
been to him.

She listened, hesitated, said that her
aunt had heard strange rumours about
him. " But I do not credit them for one
moment," said she. " Aunt must be deceived.

At all events, I will see that you
are invited to our New Year's festival.
If you are then in Leyden, you can see
my aunt and uncle both. My answer
must depend on theirs ; and on — on —
your own actions."

The Burgomaster's daughter grew chilled
and weary of waiting, under all her furs.
He pressed the soft hand withdrawn from
Luthera's muff to meet his, thanked her
as impressively ; and whilst the damsels
and their attendant went skating over the
canal between the lines of sparkling trees,
hurried back to his room, and to his books
in an ecstasy of delight and anticipation.

His skates hung temptingly on the wall
before him. Whenever he raised his eyes
from his book, he beheld them dangling
idly there. He could not resist their
invitation. He threw down his books, and
took the skates from the nail.

He went flying along the canal ; but he
could neither overtake those he sought,
nor the flying time he was losing.

But he met those he would gladly have

avoided, and they stuck to him close as
leeches.

He persisted in going back to his study ;
but Van de Venter and the rest persisted in
going with him ; and once there, rummaged
his cupboards for glasses, bottles, cigars,
and so forth, determined to make merry at
his expense, and to put a stop to his newly-born
love for study.

The next morning his head ached, and
study was impossible. His room was filled
with stale tobacco smoke. Into the open
air he went, having a sadly dissipated and
dissatisfied aspect. Congratulating himself
on having been seen by no one, he returned,
meeting close by his door an elderly man ina
sober suit of clothes, who had the air of
a country schoolmaster, and who looked
closely at him in passing. And it crossed
his mind hazily that he had met the same
old fellow on Derek's stairhead on his
last visit.

It was not a lecture morning. He was
glad of that. But his own conscience was
lecturing him pretty soundly, as he lay

on his couch, unable to read or do anything
but reproach himself.

Next morning found him in the lecture-room
; but there too for a wonder was
Van de Venter, who laughed at Hendrik's
lament over his lost day, and insisted that
it would be better not to go up for examination
until the next term. It would be
better than certain failure.

The upshot was, that Hendrik did not
go up for examination, but Derek Keppel
did — and won high honours.

It was only what might have been expected
; but when Hendrik heard that
Derek had gained his degree, he was stung
by a sense of shameful defeat, ay, just as
if he had been up and sent back by the
examiners.

Yet Derek, it was reported, had overdone
it, had studied too closely, and was
ill. His mother and sister had come from
Amsterdam to Leyden to nurse him.

Hendrik himself remained in Leyden,
alike ashamed to go home, and unfitted for
its quietude. He had more need to have

20I

been ashamed of the company he kept and
the way he spent his time and his father's
money. At all events, he spent none of his
leisure by the couch of his best adviser, or
he might have learned something.

VOL. III.

CHAPTER IV.

THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL.

T SO came about, that on Christmas
Eve, which Mynheer
MeuHn and his good vrouw
had expected he would spend
with them, Hendrik, and Van de Venter,
Zwart and Groen were playing billiards
together in a koffy-huis, or cafe, which the
three latter frequented.

There were a couple of billiard-tables in
the long well-lighted room ; and along the
walls were ranged a number of small round
mahogany tables, on each of which was set,
not only a case of paper spills for pipe-lighting,
but a neat white porcelain spittoon

whilst long clay pipes lay in a rest close
at hand.

At one of these small side-tables sat the
white-headed individual Hendrik had met,
and from his garb taken for a schoolmaster,
a week or ten days earlier. He had a
glass of beer on the table before him, a
long clay pipe in his mouth, a newspaper
in his hand, and seemed to be smoking and
reading in perfect contentment.

His repose did not long remain unbroken.

The three students were in that state of
hilarious excitement in which they were
equally ripe for frolic or for mischief.
Reckless Van de Venter and swaggering
Zwart, having more than a spice of the
latter in them, might have been imps at
the elbows of Hendrik and Groen, prompting
them to annoy others and provoke a
quarrel.

More than one sober citizen had left the
cafe to avoid them.

Ere long they espied the white-headed
old gentleman. Then they turned on the
fountains of their small wit, and cracked

jokes at the expense of the " old schoolmaster,"
as they dubbed him openly.

Whether he was deaf or absorbed in his
paper, he took no heed. Presently, after
a whisper in Hendrik's ear, a hard paper
bullet, manufactured out of a spill, went
flying across the billiard-table, hit the bowl
of the schoolmaster's pipe, and broke it.

The " old schoolmaster," without a word
or change of countenance, laid down the
broken pipe-stem, stretched out his hand
for a fresh pipe, filled, lit, and began to
smoke and read as complacently as before.

Another paper bullet came from Hen-drink's
flirting thumb. Again the pipe was
broken. Again a fresh one was taken,
and lit for smoking as before, without a
word. The "schoolmaster" resumed his
reading calmly

A third time a like missile went. " How
like you that, old schoolmaster ? " went
with it, as a third pipe-bowl fell to the floor
broken.

I do not like it," was the quiet answer.

Van de Venter whispered to Hendrik.

The latter went blustering up to the old
man, " And why don't you like it ? We'll
teach you, old schoolmaster, not to sit
reading here all night," and the newspaper
was snatched from his hand.

I think, young gentlemen, you need
someone to teach you good manners."

Not you, old schoolmaster. We'll give
you a lesson first. You'll have to fight one
of us."

"I do not want to fight," said the
other quietly. " Can you not leave me
alone ?"

Leave you alone, after your reflection
on our manners ! No, schoolmaster. You
will have to fight."

I don't want to fight," was still the old
gentleman's reply, the more he was urged.

At last Hendrik pushed the quiet old
man's hat off" his head with the billiard cue,
and said, with a sneer, —

Will you fight me now, old schoolmaster
? "

A Dutchman always wears his hat in
public ; only the waiters run about the caf

bareheaded. This insult was not to be
overlooked.

You have left me no alternative, young
man."

You can choose your own weapons
old schoolmaster,' cried Van de Venter
contemptuously.

I suppose so," said he imperturbably.
I choose pistols."

Very well," replied Van de Venter.
Then be on the dunes at Katwyk by
eight in the morning ; and come prepared
with a second. I shall act for my
friend."

And don't you fail to be there, old
schoolmaster," Hendrik called after him
as he went.

The old schoolmaster will not fail to be
there," said he calmly, looking back at
Hendrik over his shoulder.

Van de Venter and Zwart had impressed
on Hendrik that until he had fought a duel,
he was not fit to be called a man, or to
mingle with gentlemen ; and that night,
between the excitement of play and the

strong geneva he had taken, he was primed
for anything.

His companions took care to keep up
the excitement, and jest over the fright
they had given the old schoolmaster ;
and he lay down on his pillow a fancied
hero.

It was not altogether so when his noisy
friends wakened him in the raw, misty chill
of the early morning. He had dreamed of
Christmas bells, father and mother, and of
Luthera ; and surely enough, there on his
table before him lay the promised invitation
to the Van Sittarts' New Year festival,
which must have been lying there since the
previous afternoon.

As he read it, a sense of dread and 
came over him to banish his delight.
How could he justify the business he was
on to Luthera, if he survived — if ?

There were, however, those around him
who left little opportunity for reflection. A
hired sledge hurried them over the eiofht
miles of frozen snow between Leyden and
Katwyk; and they smoked, sang, and jested

all the way, until he was half-ashamed of
his own better thoughts.

At Katwyk the Rhine is, or was, discharged
by immense sluice-gates into the
since drained — Haarlemer Meer, or sea ;
and between those sluice-gates and the salt-pans
in which the sea water was collected
to be afterwards boiled into salt in Leyden,
and under shelter of the grassy dunes or
sand-hills, was the peaceful spot selected
for unholy work.

I have said that Hendrik was not wholly
bad, though the tempters by his side were
doing their best to make him so. Not
all their badinage could keep him from
thinking ; and he had the grace to put up
a silent prayer to be preserved from bloodguiltiness.


His comrades had made merry over the
conclusion that the old schoolmaster would
be afraid to meet them ; and Hendrik in
his secret soul hoped they were right.

But surely enough two figures, muffled
in fur-lined cloaks with high stand-up collars,
were there before them. And, as if in

respectful attendance, a negro also well
wrapped up from the cold stood a little
apart.

The preliminaries were settled by the
seconds, the pistols were loaded, the ground
was measured, the cloaks were thrown
aside, and then Hendrik and the other
students beheld — not an old timid schoolmaster
in a rusty suit, but a naval officer
in full uniform, with his breast covered
with medals and decorations, whom his
second, also a naval officer, addressed as
Admiral

Hendrik stood aghast ! He was awed
by the evident rank of his self-provoked
antagonist. He stepped forward, hesitated,
stammered out some sort of blundering
apology — " Had he known who the
gentleman was, he would not have presumed
to — "

Exactly," interrupted the Admiral
sternly ; " you would insult a poor old
schoolmaster, whose only weapon was a
cane, and have been civil enough to a man
of position, to whom all weapons were

familiar. You provoked the quarrel, you
must bide the issue. I have a lesson to
give you. Take your place."

He spoke apart to his second.

The Admiral," said the latter, " considering
the youth and inexperience of his
antagonist, concedes the right to fire first."

Van de Venter, though much less assured
than ordinary, accepted the favour for his
principal. Hendrik, who did not want to
fire at all, would have declined ; indeed,
he would have shrunk out of the duel
altogether, had not his second taunted him
with pusillanimity, and threatened to post
him as a coward all over the University.

They were placed. Hendrik trembled
in spite of his efforts to nerve himself. It
is one thing to shoot at a senseless mark,
and another to have a man for a target.
The signal was given, he fired — his bullet
had gone astray. There stood the Admiral,
unharmed ; and the novice was
thankful for that.

It was the Admiral's turn to fire. All
Hendrik's courage had gone. His big

frame was in a tremor, for he felt as if his
doom was sealed, and home, Luthera, his
hope of heaven, lost to him for ever. He
saw and seemed to hear the cock of the
pistol levelled against him. A world of
anguish and repentance was condensed
into a second.

The pistol was lowered, ttn^x^A.

Take your life, young man " said the
Admiral. "And now, Mungo," addressing
the black servant.

An apple went up high into the air, there
was a report, the Admiral's pistol was discharged,
the apple came down in fragments.

And now, young man," said he sternly,
if you have not had your lesson, let me
give you one."

Another pistol was handed to him,
another apple thrown, with like result.

Now," said he again, " you see that
my aim is unerring ; that if I had fired, a
human soul would have gone to its account
with God ; gone with the sin of
premeditated and provoked murder fresh
upon it ; gone to register a deed of blood

before the throne of the Prince of Peace,
whose birth we celebrate this Christmas
morn. Go home, young man, to reflect on
what you might have been, but for my forbearance,
my respect for the Christian laws
you ignore — a murderer or a corpse. Go
home, and on your knees thank God for
the life He has spared you for repentance
and amendment. Quit your evil associates
; learn to honour grey hairs, and forget
not the old schoolmaster's first lesson."

The rank of the speaker tended to impress
his teaching on his hearers. Not on
on all alike : Van de Venter and Zwart
treated the whole affair as a good joke long
before they reached Leyden ; but there
Groen and Hendrik left them to oo their
several ways, Hendrik to his own chambers
to think over what might have been,
in much sobered mood.

He had an aid to reflection in the card
of invitation to the New Year's Eve gathering
at the Van Sittarts'. And now, instead
of thinking of the offended majesty of
Heaven, he began to torment himself with

fears lest a rumour of his dolnsfs should
reach Luthera's ears. He knew how
strong were her Christian principles, how
great was her repugnance to insobriety,
how deep her reverence for age, and he
paced his narrow room in a fever of unrest.
But he neither betook himself to schiedam
nor to Van der Venter. He locked and
barred his door to keep intruders out. No
one came, he had his day to himself, and
he spent it in thinking of the precipice on
which he stood. Happily Van de Venter
had thought best to quit Leyden, and he
came not near. Towards the end of the
week Hendrik bethought him of the sick
Derek ; but he was reported better, and
not in his chambers.

New Year's Eve came, the great annual
festival of Holland. The streets and canals
were unusually alive with people on their
way to family gatherings.

The green door was once more open to
Hendrik. He was ushered into the well-known
drawing-room, all ablaze with light.
There was a murmur of voices, a rustle of

silks in his ears, there were people around
him, but his eyes were riveted upon one
group near the stove, and his steps were
stayed.

There stood his late antagonist, in his
uniform and decorations, in conversation
with Luthera and Derek, whose face,
though very pale, had lost all trace of
melancholy or despondence.

Luthera came forward as he advanced,
half-bewildered,

"Mynheer Meulin," said she, "allow
me to present you to my uncle, Admiral
Van Sittart."

Hendrik's heart sank as he bowed to the
man against whom his pistol had so recently
been levelled.

I think you and I have met before,
Mynheer Meulin ; I was an old schoolmaster
then, you know, but I have been
promoted, — a little more rapidly than
Captain Van Sittart was promoted," he
added, as a sort of parenthesis.

Hendrik wondered what was to come
next. The room seemed to swim round

with him. He could scarcely master a
word in reply.

Derek came up, drew his arm within his,
led him to a lady in mourning on a sofa,
with a pretty girl beside her ; they were
Derek Keppel's mother and sister. He
introduced Hendrik as 2i friend dint fellow-student.


Then have you come to congratulate
my son ?" asked the older lady, with a smile.

On what, madam } On his new
deg-ree ? "

Nay, did you not know ? The bullet
has been extracted from his side. During
his hours of quiet study it had dropped or
worked itself within easy reach, and as
soon as the examination was over, it was
removed."

Then I have in deed reason to congratulate
him."

But that is not all ! " said Jonkvrouw
Keppel, with a pleasing smile. " He has
received a lucrative Government appointment,
and is betrothed to jonkvi-ouw-san
der Meyer."

What ! Derek ? " exclaimed he,
scarcely able to contain himself, " Derek ?
Where is the treacherous — " he looked
as if for a foe, his nostrils dilating ; he
confronted only the Admiral.

Young sir," said he, laying his hand on
Hendrik's sleeve and drawing him aside to
a recess, " have you so soon forgotten the
schoolmaster's first lesson ? We can have
no heroics here ? Be brave enough to take
your second lesson like a man. You have
only yourself to blame. Do you remember
rushing from this house to accuse Mynheer
Keppel of supplanting you, and the
good advice he gave on that occasion.
Your impetuosity had left an open door behind
you. That conversation was overheard
and reported by the old schoolmaster. It
was a revelation, not only to myself and
sister, but to Luthera. It opened the
girl's eyes in more ways than one. She
had known Derek all her life ; and loved
him unawares, until yotL came with your
handsome face and plausible tongue
to mislead and bewilder her. I came

home only just in time to prevent a
grievous blunder. She had mistaken
Derek's honourable silence for indifference,
and she equally mistook your passion for
love ! "

'mistook it! " repeated Hendrick bitterly.

Yes, mistook it ! " said the Admiral
emphatically. " It is a mistake to call that
emotion love which does not rouse all a
man's better nature within him ; and in all
things you were ' unstable as water.' My
sister gave me an inkling of your pretensions
to our niece. I happen to know your
worthy father. It behoved me to learn
what manner of man was his son, and if
rumour lied. It was not by chance I took
my seat in the cafe. The guardians of a
young girl had need be wise and wary.
Would you hear from Lutherans own lips
what influenced her decision ? "

Nay, nay," groaned Hendrik, " I have
heard enough."

Not unless you have heard enough to
change the course of your life, and set you
on a new path in the New Year. Idle

VOL. III. p

habits and sinful associates lead to the
gulf of destruction. Shun them, work
hard, and pray hard to be delivered from
temptation, and in time to come you will
thank the ' old schoolmaster ' for both his
lessons."

And years afterwards, when Derek
Keppel was the proud husband of Luthera,
and all Holland recognised his skill as an
engineer, Hendrik, who was about to
marry Derek's pretty sister, the one who
had first made known to him Derek's betrothal,
did acknowledge with thanks the
much-needed lessons of the " Old Schoolmaster,"
hard as they had been at the time.
He had fought a duel with himself, and
had come off victor ; but his weapon was
the sword of the Spirit, and his shield,
God's Word.

S I do not tell this story either to
advertise myself or my trade, I
need simply premise that I have
an old establishment in the boot
and shoe line in the neighbourhood of
Shudehill, Manchester, and that business
connected therewith carried me, at the
close of the year 185 — , to the quaint old
Cheshire town Sandbach, well known
throughout the trade for the production
of heavy articles in the way of hobnailed
clodhopping foot-gear, and their

antitheses, dainty and bright-coloured sllp-
perkins for the tiniest infantile toes.

I never throw away either time or money
without some show of reason, so I took
the parliamentary train from London Road
Station, as being at once early and
cheap.

There had been a heavy fall of snow
two days before, but a sharp frost had set
in, and the wind was keen and biting.
The steam of our breaths condensed on
the cold windows of the carriage, and ran
down the glass in fanciful and Intricate
runnels.

All the passengers who had the wherewithal
were wrapped and muffled to the
chin, and we had not long crossed the
Stockport Viaduct before there was an
unmistakable odour of brandy In the compartment.


It was cold, and no mistake, and I
shivered under all my wraps ; but there
was a hardy sailor opposite to me, with
collar loose and bosom all exposed, as if
it had been midsummer Instead of midwinter.

He had a P-jacket on, but it was
all open and unbuttoned. The sight of
his bare breast almost set my teeth chattering,
and I told him so.

Lord bless you, sir," said he, " I'm
used to it ; an' as for cold, why, a chap as
has been knocking about the seas for years
in a Greenland whaler isn't afraid of an
icicle. Cold ! Why, you don't know
what cold is in these latitudes ! If you
felt the ribs of your ship crushing between
icebergs, and had to slide down frozen lines
that cut like knives, and could not touch an
iron bolt or martin-spike but you left your
skin upon it, then you might call it cold ;
but here, Lord love you ! " and he shook
his head as if commiserating at once my
ignorance and effeminacy.

I never kept company with polar
bears," was my retort, " and don't need
to carry a thermometer to the arctic circle
so long as I see a little creature like that
shivering in these latitudes,''^ and I nodded
towards the opposite corner, where sat a
patient-looking little girl, some ten or

eleven years old, whose clothes bore no
proportion to the weather.

He leaned forward ; she being small,
and on the same side with himself, he had
not seen her before. It was quite evident
she was travelling by herself. It was not
the work of a minute for him to strip off
his P-jacket.

Here, my lass ; Jack Frost won't bite
thee through that. I say, ma'am, just
help the little wench to wrap it round her."
This to a stiff matron, who looked unutterable
dao-orers at him for the crushing sustained
in his kindly attempt to reach the
little wench " beyond her, but she never
removed her insensate fingers from her
sable muff.

More womanly hands, however, from
the opposite seat tucked the woolly garment
round the mite of a traveller, and
made me somewhat ashamed of my own
lukewarmness in remedying the evil I had
been so ready to perceive.

The young lady — she was not more
than three-and-twenty — produced a bun

from a reticule, and, after some hesitation,
the Httle wench " put forth a gloveless
purpled hand, and took it.

The pleasant-faced sailor leaned forward.

I say, little lass, where do you hail
from ? I seem to have known a face
some time uncommon like yours ; what
they call thee ? "

Fanny Watson, sir," murmured she
in a voice half-choked with bun.

Hem," he muttered, with his chin in
his hand, in self-communing, " don't remember
anyone of that name. And what
brings you travelling all alone, Fanny ? "
he asked, after a pause.

The bun went down from the lips, and
the little eyes filled with tears.

Fm going to see my mother, sir, and
granny could not come with me."

She was not shy, neither was she communicative,
yet one query or another from
all three of us elicited that she lived in
Tib Street, Manchester, with her father's
mother ; that her granny had had a letter
more than a week before, to say that her

own mother, whom she had not seen for a
year, was very ill, and wanted to see her,
and that she had not been able to eo before,
because " granny could not spare the
money."

And where does your mother live, my
dear ? " put in the young lady kindly.

"In Sandbach, ma'am — in Union Street."

Sandbach, eh ! " exclaimed the sailor
and myself in a breath ; but he added,
"your granny might have sent you by
Woden, the carrier, he wouldn't ha' charged
much for a morsel like you."

Here I struck in, — " Woden, the carrier,
has been dead some years, my man ; I
believe he was killed on the road."

This changed the current of the conversation,
and it turned out that the warmhearted
sailor, whose name was Ben Breton,
was a native of Sandbach, returning
thither after an absence of twelve years.

By this time we had reached Crewe, not
then the imposing station it is now.

Myself and carpet-bag having got out
of the way, Ben Brearton lifted out the

bundled-up little Fanny, jacket and all, and
placed her on the platform.

We had the 'bus all to ourselves, and a
pleasant quartette we made, the sailor and
the little girl lapsing into occasional fits of
reverie.

At Wheelock Bridge a lady and a servant
were in waiting for Miss Birch. I
had helped her to alight, and she had
shaken hands with me at parting, and had,
moreover, admitted that she had come to
spend Christmas at the house of a friend,
who was manager of the saltworks, though
her own home was in Manchester.

As the 'bus went on, the sailor gave
vent to frequent ejaculations. " Ah ! there's
the old well, and plenty of hips, no doubt,
on the ragged hedge above it, where the
dog-roses used to blow ; " and, as we
passed a deserted red-brick mansion,
elevated above the roadside, " And there's
the haunted house, empty to this day ! "
and so on, as one thing after another
awoke recollections either from a change
or no change.

As we neared Sandbach (it is but a mile
from Wheelock), clear and distinct through
the frosty air came the sound of church
bells.

It was but a preliminary note ; but the
bluff, clear - eyed, open - breasted sailor
started as if he had been shot.

"The old church bells! Ah! the last
time I heard them ! " he exclaimed, as if
to himself; and an expression of mute
agony swept over his open countenance,
and stood out in every muscle of his
sinewy hands as he clasped them tightly
together on his knees ; and the same deep
anguish bowed his head, and set his strong
white teeth together.

"Ah! when I heard them last!" he
repeated, under his breath.

I did not like to intrude on his privacy ;
but the little girl looked up at him wistfully,
and laid her small hand gently on
his, as I counted the strokes of the bell
one by one.

It's the death-bell," said she, in a sort of
apprehensive whisper. " Do you think — "

I had incautiously counted aloud, —
Thirty-seven, and a woman ! "

Thirty-seven ! Oh ! my mother's
thirty-seven. Do you think — " and her
white face grew whiter,

"And I'm thirty-seven, my little lass;
and I wouldn't mind if them bells was
tolling for me this minute. They rang
a wedding-peal when I heard them last,"
said the sailor, stroking her head caressingly.
" Cheer up, little one ; there are
more people thirty - seven than your
mother and me. Don't let the bell
frighten you because it tolls. Them
Sandbach bells rang worse than a death-knell
to me in their merriest peal twelve
years ago, just in the harvest-time. And
now, as I come back to the old place
once more, I am welcomed by the toll
of a death - bell indeed ! Who's gone
now :

We had reached the " Wheatsheaf,"
here I proposed to put up.

Oh ! I should have got out at the
Top-o'-th'-town," cried Fanny. " We

have passed Union Street, and I've got
this big bundle."

Ben Brearton smiled at her estimate
of size, took the bundle, tied in a blue
check handkerchief, in one hand, threw
his P-jacket to an ostler, and said, —

I'll see you home, little one ; but
you'd best stay and have some warm
breakfast first."

No, no! there was no staying for the
little one with that church-bell tolling in
her ears. The hammer struck as hard on
her heart as on the bell.

As they went up the town, I noticed
how thin and patched were the boots on
the young feet, hurrying so anxiously over
the frozen snow, and a sort of wish rose to
my mind that I had measured her for a new
pair for a Christmas box.

I had ordered breakfast — the hurried
mouthful taken in the early morning
counted for nothing — and sat warming
my own benumbed toes at a blazing fire,
in a room adorned with black-framed
portraits of racing celebrities, and a case

or two of stuffed perch and bream, waiting
for the comestibles, when back came Ben
Brearton, and staggered rather than walked
to the nearest seat. It happened to be a
huge chintz-covered sofa, and on one of its
arms down went his arm and head, and
never lifted, though the pretty waitress
came in and out many times, and even
intimated — " Breakfast ready, sir."

You seem to have had a shock, my
friend," said I, at length, the bell tolling
solemnly all the time.

Well, Mr Logwood, if you care to
listen, I'll tell you why the sound of them
bells, that used to ring me to church so
cheerily every Sunday, seems to drive the
very blood from my heart now."

I made a motion of assent, and he
went on.

My father was a master shoemaker,
and kept five or six pair of hands at the
vanstone. We lived at the pretty low
cottage at the far side of the common,
with the fruit-garden stretching Qi'oodish
bit down the lane, right opposite to Squire

Wilson's. He bound me 'prentice to his
foreman, and I handled awl and 'teachings
till I was twenty-one.

But long years before that I had given
my heart away to Ruth Farringdon, the
sweetest and prettiest lass in all Sandbach.

Her father was a well-to-do provision
dealer in the marketplace, wore a broad-brimmed
hat, and a drab coat an' gaiters,
and was as dusty with flour as Hopper
the miller.

Many a time I tremble now when
I think of the dangers into which I led
my little playmate. You see, she was
four years younger than me, and was
quite a little one when she first sat on a
form in Miss Lawton's school-room, whereat
a side table, the clerk himself taught
me and one or two other lads to read, and
write, and cypher.

One door of the school-room opened
on the churchyard, the other on the waste
ground, on the far side of which was the
back gate of Farringdon the baker.

Being reckoned a steady lad, I was

o

trusted to take the little lass home now
and again ; but there were baulks of
timber, and planks, and kid-stacks * on
the ground, and many a game of tick, or
hide-and-seek, we have had amongst them
before we reached the bakehouse.

One day — I remember it as if it were
last Meek — we were breaking up for the
midsummer holidays, and each of the
children took a shilling to Miss Lawton,
to help to make up a feast. It was a gala
day, and the clerk had thrown open the
little side gate into the churchyard, and
girls and boys together ran wild amongst
the old gravestones. Then he opened the
belfry door, and, for a treat, let the bigger
children up to the top of the tower, to look
through a telescope of his.

Sure enough little Ruth Farringdon
crept up behind me, and — I grow sick
now when I think of it — leaned over one
of the embrasures of the parapet, and,
growing giddy, lost her balance. Tom

Stacks of firewood.

Arden and I caught hold of her skirts
just in time to save her as she was going
over ; and I never shall forget the fright
I had that day !

** From that time out Tom and I did
little but fight over Ruth Farringdon, and,
as he was both older and bigger, he often
got the best of it. Then his father was a
builder, and had a large house (the old redbrick
one at the end of the marketplace,
just above Swan Bank), and he was given
to crow over me on that account too.

But little Ruth stuck by me, in spite
of his father's big house, and his boast
that he had saved her life ; and I know
she thought more of the two or three
cherries or strawberries I bought on
Thursdays with my market-penny, and
put in her lap as she sat on the steps of
the old market cross, than all the papers
of gingerbread he bought her at Mrs
Carbury's.

About the time I was set to work,
old Farringdon removed Ruth from Miss
Lawton's school to a better one, kept by

two old maids named Moss, in a big house,
right facing Arden's ; and whenever Tom
cotdd shirk his work, down would go plane
or saw, and he be waiting by Moss's broad
steps, to carry her book-bag and slate for
her ; you see, she was getting a biggish
girl then.

But that did not last long. Old Farringdon
bound Ruth 'prentice to Mrs
Carbury, to learn dressmaking. You see,
she was a dressmaker as well as a confectioner,
and worked for all the gentry
around Sandbach, having a lot of lasses in
her work-room. And there it was Ruth
came across Letty Ormerod, another
'prentice, the daughter of Lord Crewe's
farm bailiff.

She was a fine, handsome lass was
Letty, with hair and eyes as black as an
Esquimaux's ; and somehow Ruth and her
became friends in no time, and there was
no chance of seeing one without the other ;
but she was always very well disposed
towards me, was Letty, and when they
went for a walk together, on holiday after-vol.

III. Q

noons, managed to drop a hint whether
they were going up the hill past Twem-
low's, or down the Lovers' Walk to Jacob's
Well, or along Braddah * Lane, or o'er the
common ; and so we were sure to meet,
and many a happy afternoon we three have
spent in the fields or lanes together, and
many's the bunch of dog-roses, or nuts, or
blackberries I've pulled down for them.
But though I always gave the best of
flowers or fruit to dear, shy little Ruth,
I think I laughed and talked freest with
Letty.

One of those afternoons we had gone
over the bridge, and along the brook, and
through the little gate by Percival's mill,
where the meadow rises like a steep bank,
and we sat down in the sunshine on the
soft grass, Ruth and Letty on each side of
me, to look at the shining water, and listen
to the song of a green linnet. I plaited a
basket for Ruth with the rushes we had
gathered by the brook side, my heart full

Shadwell.

to overflowing with the silent joy of her
presence, when a step and a voice caused
me to look up. Tom Arden stood between
me and the sunshine.

' Oh, this is the way you spend your
holidays, is it ? Suppose I join you. You
know, the more the merrier ; ' and I thought
he cast a glance at Letty Ormerod.

I saw the colour mount to Ruth's forehead,
and I know my own face crimsoned
as he threw his long body down beside heron
the grass, and began to peel and strip
the rushes I wanted to use, and then
laughingly held her hands in his, to
prevent her taking the basket I had made.

"It was play, but the play had a meaning
in it, as I found to my sorrow.

When we rose to go, he pulled Ruth's
arm within his own, and, without rudeness
to Letty, I could make no remonstrance ;
indeed, I seemed tongue-tied after he
joined us.

From that day forth, whichever way
we went, he was sure to meet us ; and all
the while, though my love grew strong and

fierce as a flame within me, I never had a
chance to give it utterance in word ; yet I
felt that Ruth loved me, and I knew I
worshipped the very ground she trod
upon.

Ay, Mr Logwood, I have gathered
the very grass she Jiad trod upon, and it
has gone with me half over the world.

But I am keeping you from your business,
sir. I must cut my yarn shorter.

'* I was not much more nor twenty
when mother died, and then troubles came
thick and fast, for father never did a bit of
good afterwards.

Mother had been buried about six
months, when one Thursday afternoon, as
I was reaching a last from the rack, I
happened to glance through the transom
window, and who should I see but my
darling Ruth at Squire Wilson's gate,
carrying a dress home for Mrs Wilson —
at least she had a large soft parcel with
her.

You may be sure I did not sit down
with the last on my lap. Down it went,

and hammer and stirrup with it, and I
bolted out of the workshop, and through
the house-place, in a hurry to reach our
little wooden garden-gate.

The bright scarlet cloak and modest
black beaver bonnet had disappeared when
I got there ; but I waited, and in about
half-an-hour Ruth stepped out and cast a
sidelong glance at our cottage, and, of
course, saw me looking for her.

The roads were muddy, and she wore
patterns ; and just as she caught my eye
she either trod in a deep rut or on a stone,
but her patten twisted, and she slipped.

I caught her as she was falling, and
caught her grateful look too. Her ankle
was wrenched, so I took her in my arms,
for the first time since she was a little one,
and carried her, with a beating heart, to
mother's low rocking-chair by our warm
fireside, and called old Betty to bathe her
ankle, whilst I mended the broken strap
of the patten which had done all the
mischief.

I daresay I left my dirty finger-marks

on her dainty cloak as I unfastened the
clasp at the throat, and gave it to Betty to
dry for brushing, and I fumbled clumsily
enough at the bonnet strings in untying
them, but she said never a word, and, when
the bonnet was off, her head sank on my
shoulder in a sort of faint.

My father was out, and the men came
crowding round, but I sent them back to
their benches, and made old Betty close
the workshop door ; and by-and-by Ruth
came round, but still I kept possession of
her and her lissom waist, and when her
dear eyes looked up into mine I saw they
drooped again, and the head I drew back to
my shoulder made no effort to withdraw.

Old Betty was too busy bathing the
sprained ankle to see anything of this, or of
the kiss I ventured to drop on the tempting
forehead, brino^inof the warm blood to
answer with a flush.

Soon Betty proposed a cup of tea, and
hobbled into the back kitchen to mix
batter for wheat-cakes, and then all the
love, kept back so long, came rushing from

my lips with the strength of a springtide.


"It was a glorious opportunity, and I
made the most of it.

Dear Ruth (she was not seventeen)
panted and trembled, but she whispered,
Oh Ben ! ' and hid her face in my breast,
(though I had only my working clothes on)
and those two words told me all I had been
lon^inor to know.

But the loving answer her warm lips
made to mine was better than a whole
dictionary of words. Many a time since
then have I lain awake in my berth, and
heard that happy, soft ' Oh, Ben ! ' above
the wash of the waves, and felt those kisses
again on my lips, till the very pain has
stung me.

Well, I mended her patten-strap, and
after dark me and Bill Wright carried her
home in mother's chair, for she could not
walk, and old Farringdon thanked us both.

Of course I called to see how Ruth's
ankle got on, glad to have a footing in the
house ; and at first old Farringdon was

very cordial. But soon, and as I thought
all of a sudden, he turned crusty as one of
his own loaves ; and not a sight could I
get of Ruth. But Letty was very kind,
and many a message she carried from one
to the other, and she never seemed tired
of hearing me talk of Ruth. She was like
a sister to me was Letty. She it was who
planned for Ruth and me to meet by Farringdon's
kid-stack on the waste ground,
as she went home from work at night, and
offered to keep watch for us when she could.

But old Farringdon caught us the very
second time we met, and he hauled Ruth
away, calling me all the sneaks and rascals
he could lay his tongue to.

It was no manner of use my going to
him the next day and asking his leave to
come courting to Ruth openly. He would
not hear a word ; said I was but a 'prentice-lad,
and not able to keep a wife if I had
one, and though I was nigh out of my
time, he was not going to let his Ruth have
her heart broken by a fellow with so many
strings to his bow.

Not a word of explanation would he
give me, but he took Ruth away from Mrs
Carbury's, and kept a strict watch over her
after that, and if it had not been for Letty,
I think I should have gone out of my
mind.

Well, the upshot was, that when my
time was up, I set off to London, to try
and better myself, old Farringdon having
come round to say that if I came back at
the end of three years with a good character
and a bit of money saved he would
help me with some more to start in business
for myself, and I should have Ruth, if she
were in the same mind.

"He would not let me see my darling
to say good-bye, but I caught sight of herat
her bedroom window, sobbing as if her
very heart would break, and she kissed her
little hand to me over and over again.

It was Christmas time, as it mig-ht be
now, sir, and I left with Letty a pair of
Adelaide boots, which I had made for
Ruth, as a Christmas box. I had taken
the measure of her shoe that happy afternoon

when it was off in my father's house-place.
Letty promised to give Ruth the
boots (I had put a letter inside one), and
all my promises of love and constancy. I
kissed the friendly lass, whose black eyes
were brimming with tears, thanked her for
her kind heart, and was gone.

I was a good workman, and got a good
place in London, and by working early and
late, and living carefully, saved money, and
every shilling I put by I felt brought me
nearer to Ruth.

Postage was dear in those days, but
every now and then I sent a letter to Letty
Ormerod holding another for Ruth, and
now and then I got one back from Letty,
but never a one from Ruth herself. Letty
said she was not allowed to write.

Letty was not much of a scholar, and
her letters, somehow, were not very satisfactory,
and at times I fancied said more
of herself than my Ruth ; but that might
have been a love-sick fancy.

But I grew anxious, and before the
three years were up went back to Sandbach,

with money in my pocket and hope
and love in my heart.

As the coach stopped at the ' George '
the old church bells began to clash
a wedding peal, and I thought to myself,
' Ah, they'll ring for Ruth and me
next ! '

I got down from the top of the coach
just as the wedding party came up the
road ; and oh ! that I live to tell it ! — came
face to face with the bride and bridegroom
Ruth and Tom Arden.

I heard a woman's scream and nothing
more. When I came to myself, they said
I had had a fit of some kind.

The coach was just ready for starting,
and I re-mounted to the seat I had just
quitted so joyously, a moody, miserable,
heart-broken wretch, silent as grim death.
And the wedding-bells were pealing all
the time, and rang merrily as I turned my
back on hope and home for ever. It was
as a death bell to me !

That is more than twelve years ago,
sir," concluded he, " and I come back

now just to see the old place once again
before I die, and I go off to sea again first
thing in the new year. There is nothing
to keep me ashore now.

You heard, sir, how the death-bell
welcomed Ben Brearton back tJiis time.
The only friend I looked to find is carried
off!

I did think to go back to Liverpool
to-night, but I must stay and see Letty put
decently in the ground, and do some thing
to make that poor little lass of hers comfortable.
I've more money than I know
what to do with, and I hear that Letty's
husband deserted her seven years since."

I wrung the sailor's hand earnestly, for
his story had affected me deeply, and then
left the inn in a hurry to transact the
business his narrative had delayed.

I bent my steps first towards the dip of
the road from the High Street, where
Morris, a manufacturer of children's shoes,
had his premises, close by the brook.

I was there some time — an hour or more.
Returning, I struck across the marketplace,

on my way to a heavy-shoemaker's on the
common. Standing with his arms folded,
I saw Ben Brearton leaning against one
of the obelisks of the ancient cross, and
gazing fixedly on the house which I
recognised as having been Farringdon's.

He did not see me, and I passed on,
but barely had I reached the large house
he had named as Arden's, when I saw a
respectable woman, without shawl or bonnet,
rushing as if she were mad up Swan
Bank, with curls and cap-strings flying
loose, regardless of frost or gazing gossips.
I made way for her to pass. Her eyes
roved from side to side, as if looking
wildly for someone. One glance was
enough : she flew rather than ran towards
the cross, and throwing her arms round
the startled sailor, cried "Ben, Ben, — dear
Ben ! forgive me ! we were both deceived! "

Letty Watson's death-bed had witnessed
a confession. She had played a double
part throughout, hoping by the interest
she showed in him to win Ben Brearton
over to herself in time. It was she who

gave Tom Arden the hint where to find
them on their Sunday rambles ; she who
had poisoned the old man's mind against
the young shoemaker, telling him that Ben
was playing a double game with Ruth and
herself. She had shown Ben's letters addressed
to herself — at first warily — then
kept back those addressed to Ruth, until
the poor girl, convinced of her lover's perfidy,
yielded to Tom Arden's pertinacity
and her old father's entreaties.

Ben's unexpected appearance on her
wedding-morn, and the fit he had had in
the street, opened her eyes somewhat ;
but not until the week before she died had
Letty revealed her own baseness, and
Ben's devotion. And then she produced
the Adelaide boots — much too small for
her own wear — which she had kept back
likewise. In the toe of the left boot
Ruth found Ben's letter, yellow with
age, which must have escaped the other's
notice.

Ruth Arden had been a widow ten
years, her husband and his father having

both been killed by the fall of a scaffolding.
After their death she had gone back to her
father's house, and when he too died she
had taken the empty cottage into which
she had been carried with a sprained ankle,
and where Ben had first told his love.

It was there I heard these particulars,
I had seen Ben's white-fact, staQ^srerinQf
amazement, and the straining clasp which
followed Ruth's passionate appeal in the
open marketplace, and, not liking to intrude,
had walked on. My business lay
close by the cottage. They, flushed with
excitement and happiness, overtook me.

Mrs Arden, a pretty woman, about
thirty-two, seemed half-ashamed of the
public display she had made.

I could not help it, sir," said she ; " a
neighbour told me that Ben had come
back, and was going away at once, and I
was too feared of losing him again to think
of other folk."

Ben Brearton was very bitter against
the treacherous woman who had marred
the best years of Ruth's life and his

own. But I think he cast his wrath and
bitterness into Letty Watson's grave, and
buried them with her.

At all events, when the old Sandbach
church bells rang their wedding peal for
Ben Brearton and Ruth in Christmas
week, little Fanny Watson was established
at the cottage and well cared for.

"The little lass has no right to suffer
for the sins of her mother ; and if we cannot
forgive at Christmas time, and when
we are happy ourselves try to make others
happy, we have no right to call ourselves
Christians," said Ben, as he seated the
child beside him at the table to partake
of the wedding feast.

And I echoed the sentiment, being a
guest, and so did the young lady on my
right hand, Miss Birch, whose acquaintance
I had considerably improved at
Wheelock, and who has now been Mrs
Hop wood more years than I care to count.

THE END.
