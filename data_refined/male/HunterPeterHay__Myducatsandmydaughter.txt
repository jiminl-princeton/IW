vox Populi

Mr. Inglebyby went down from London to
Scotland boiling with rage against Mr. Arden,
/ and quoting freely from the Vindictive Psalms.
He had spent two days with his nephew,
arguing, ]leading, expostulating  but in vain.
It had been ascertained that stock to the
respectable amount of 40,000 stood against
Lynn's name in the register of Lone Peak
shareholders. But nothing would induce
Lynn to repudiate the transaction, to make
the matter public, and crush '* that plausible
swindler" by the exposure. Mr. Inglebyby
could not understand it. His nephew had

VOL. HI. A

assured him that he no longer aspired to be
Mr. Arden's son-in-law  why, then, should
any feeling of delicacy enter into the matter ?
Lynn told his uncle that even though the
money were lost, he would still, as it appeared,
have enough to live on ; and that
what he intended to do, in the meantime,
was  nothing. There was a quiet determination
in his way of saying this which made
Mr. Inglebyby rather afraid of his nephew.
He had not suspected that Arthur was capable
of so much obstinacy. It was quite
evident that he meant to take his own way
henceforward, right or wrong ; and Mr. Inglebyby,
recognising this fact with sorrow, ceased
from his persuasions. It was some consolation
to him that Mr. Barnard the lawyer, and Mr.
Ayres his co-trustee, took the same view of the
matter as he did himself. It was arranged
that Lynn should have an interview with
these gentlemen ; and Mr. Inglebyby could only
hope that their representations might have
more weight with his nephew than his own.
Mr. Inglebyby, looking back on those two

days spent with his nephew, could not regard
them as at all satisfactory. After the agitation
of that first interview, Lynn had not
spoken to him another word of reproach.
His manner, when they met next morning,
had been calm and composed. He had
seemed, outwardly, in the proper frame of
mind for receiving good advice. But Mr.
Inglebyby, on proceeding to offer good advice,
had very soon discovered that it would
not be followed. There was, indeed, something
guarded and reserved about Lynn's
way of taking his counsel which he felt to
be far worse than open defiance. Mr. Inglebyby
had to draw what comfort he could from the
fact that his nephew had now broken with
Miss Arden; and that he had promised to
visit his relatives in Shawkirk some time
after the election should be over, and his
own affairs definitely arranged. Against
this, however, must be set his refusal to
declare open war on Mr. Arden ; and his
express determination to go on with his
work at the Forum office, until another

sub-editor should be found to take his place.
This latter resolve was very terrible to Mr.
Inglebyby. It added fuel to his wrath against
Mr. Arden. It intensified his longing to beat
Shawkirk ; it made him grudge every
minute of his absence from the scene of
strife. Three clear days would be left him,
wherein to strain every nerve in opposition
to the man who dared to come before a
Scottish constituency, after inveigling Arthur
Lynn into the Lone Peak swindle, and introducing
him to the infidel Mallory.

When Mr. Inglebyby reached the borough,
he was amazed to find his son Eichard the
hero of the hour. Men everywhere were
talking of the 'great speech' which Dick
had delivered on the previous evening, and
of the powerful influence it was likely to
have on the issue of the election. When
Mr. Inglebyby heard where this speech had
been made, he was, for a time, dumb with
fury. But when he learned what its tenour
had been, a certain feeling of satisfaction
mingled itself with his anger.

Mr. Inglebyby had been in trouble of mind
about his son, before his departure for London.
It had seemed good to Dick to adopt a political
creed of his own  and that creed was
the Tory one.

"Yes, I'm going to support Elvan," he
had said to his father, when sternly questioned
on the subject. "You say yourself
that Arden s a swindler, and as for Trotter,
what's he ?  a low cad in trade. Now,
Elvan's a gentleman. He's got a stake in
the country, and all that, you know. If I
had a vote, I'd vote for him. Anyhow, I
mean to help him all I can."

"Eichard," Mr Inglebyby had replied, "you
shall do nothing of the sort. Understand
clearly, once for all, that I forbid it. Your
'support' cannot, I should imagine, materially
affect the reckless young nobleman you
have mentioned. But I will not have you
interfere in these matters at all. Neither
will I permit you to speak in that way of
Bailie Trotter. I do not agree with all of
Bailie Trotter's views, but in the present

crisis  when we are menaced by a Lord,
who, I am informed, spends his life in
running races on horseback, and by a Gambler,
whose political opinions are derived
from an Infidel Republican in London  in
the present crisis I have felt it my Duty
to nominate Bailie Trotter, and to do all
I can to secure his return. As for you,
you had better keep close to your desk at
the Works, and leave politics alone until
you have acquired the rudiments of a commercial
education."

This rebuke had reduced Dick to silence
for the time, but had not changed his political
views. And he had taken advantage of his
father's absence to make public profession of
his Conservatism. The Tory partisans had
welcomed Dick among them, on account of
the name he bore ; and invited him in flattering
terms to appear on the platform at one
of Lord Elvan's meetings.

It was not the spell of oratory that drew
a crowd to the meetings of the Conservative
candidate, Lord Elvan was not eloquent.

Neither had Mr. Haig and his other mentors
found it easy to imbue him with political
lore. When they sought to fix in his memory
the dates of the chief measures aimed in recent
times against his Order, he would answer,
*Yes, that was in Favonius's year'  or, 'All
right ; I'll remember ; Riser s year '  dating
by the Derby, as the Greeks dated by the
Olympic Games. His speeches were written
for him. Parts of them were very fiery
and impassioned; and as Lord Elvan read
on without the faintest flicker of interest
or animation, the contrast between his manner
and matter was curious, and in its way
effective. At times he was plainly unable to
decipher his MS., and this told greatly in his
favour. It put the Liberal section of the
audience into good-humour. It seemed to
show them the sad results of hereditary
Toryism. But the great attraction at Lord
Evans meetings was the scope given for
the exercise of the native wit. Whoever
aspired to be a 'voice' had there his opportunity.
To ' hiss a gentleman ' is much ; but

to 'chaff' a lord is a joy for ever. It was
rapture to be able to offer the noble candidate
to " tak' sax tae ane about the Demon "
or to inform him in a quasi-confidential
manner that his colt had no chance for the
Leger "against the Bell-pull." The 'heckling,'
however, was but a poor affair. The touch
of the Master's hand was wanting. Sandy
Tennant was elsewhere, operating on Mr.
Arden ; for which duty he had been specially
told off during the contest. Mr. M'Cand-
wish, the Evangelical Union pastor, was allowed
to be only a cold and feeble paradise of the
inimitable slater. Lord Elvan, who appeared
to better advantage in answering or declining

o o o

to answer questions than in making speeches,
contrived even to turn the laugh against the
reverend gentleman.

It was at the very close of the meeting that
Dick Ingieby made his memorable appearance.
No one had called on him to propose a motion
or to make a speech ; no one knew for what
object he had risen from his chair, and come
to the front of the platform, Dick, apparently,

knew just as little as anyone else what he was
about to say. During the last two days he
had been in a state of abnormal excitement,
and the champagne with which some of his
new Tory friends had plied him freely that
very evening, had carried the election fever
to his head. The Liberals in the hall, being
most of them under the impression that he
was going to move an amendment on the resolution
in Lord Elvan's favour, received him
with laughter and applause. But Dick soon
undeceived them. 'look here, I'm a Tory," he
began ; " proud . . . give my support to . . ."
Then a burst of laughter, loud and long, broke
from the audience ; and a Voice made itself
heard :  '' Eh, laddie, what's your father
say?"  followed by more laughter. "Don't
care for that !"  cried Dick, in a voice which
was audible enough, though the articulation
was a little thick  " man must have his own
convictions . . . can't help it . . . free country,
you know "  at which point another shout of
laughter drowned his words. But Dick had now
got hold of a definite idea, and was manifestly

struggling to body it forth in speech. A few
'Hear, hears' from some mirthful spirits on
the platform incited him to proceed. He was
heard to say something about " gentleman " 
"stake in the country"  "always safe to
back "  " low cad in trade "  and then to
utter the word " swindler'' This stirred up a
great commotion. There were shouts of
"Withdraw !"" Speak up !" "Gang wa'
hame, man!"  "Go on!"  groans and derisive
cheers. Then a voter got up excitedly
in the body of the hall, and fiercely demanded
to know whom Mr. Inglebyby Junior was calling
a " swindler." " I'll tell you that !" shrieked
Dick ; and an interval of comparative silence
encouraged him to make the revelation. He
appealed to the audience whether they did not
know his cousin, Arthur Lynn ? With engaging
frankness, he took them into his confidence
with regard to Lynn and his affairs. He told
them about Lynn's fortune, which he estimated
roughly at between two and three
millions sterling. The ' Shawkirk chiefs,' to
all of whom the name of Lynn was familiar,

listened open-mouthed and eager. But Dick's
first introduction of Mr. Arden's name, in this
connection, caused a renewal of the uproar.
Stop the fellow, I say "  said Lord Elvan to
Mr. Macritchie, who was in the chair, and who
had been following Dick's disjointed harangue
with manifest interest and satisfaction.  * No,
no, my Lord," expostulated Mr. Macritchie;
*' let him go on ! This is all in your Lordship's
favour, and besides, I'm sure he's telling
the truth."  " That doesn't matter," said his
Lordship ; "stop him, all the same. This isn't
fair fighting, you know."  But the audience
declined to have Dick stopped. He had said
enough to whet their curiosity, and intensify
their thirst for further personalities. "Nana
!"  they shouted as Mr. Macritchie rose to
call Dick to order  " Let him alone ! Foot
wit, man ! Tell us a' about it !"  and before
the speaker could be stopped, he had conveyed
to the minds of his hearers a distinct impression
that the Liberal candidate had done something
' shady,' in connection with Arthur
Lynn's newly-inherited wealth. Dick resumed

his seat, flushed, and, on the whole, triumphant
; but not without some inward qualms
when he thought of the paternal wrath, as also
of certain possibilities under the law of libel.
Lord Elvan's meeting broke up in some confusion.
Mr. Macritchie and his friends did not
mind that. They professed deeply to deplore
the ' importation of such private and personal
matters into the contest ;' and expressed loud
regret that the meeting should have insisted
on ' hearing young Inglebyby out,' despite the
Chairman's endeavour to silence him. But
Dick's oration afforded them, none the less, a
secret delight. It might safely be left to the
other side  the Trotter faction  to make the
most of this revelation ; and they had a great
and not unfounded confidence in Mr. Small of
the Border Warden.

These things were fully recounted to Mr.
Inglebyby, within half an-hour of his return
to Shawkirk. Mr. Inglebyby's feelings were
divided, as has been said, between anger with
his renegade offspring, and satisfaction at the
injury that had been done to Mr. Arden's

candidature. He found himself assailed with
questions, but was very cautious in his replies.
Yes ; it was true that his nephew had come
into a fortune. As to the other matter, he
declined to express an opinion. He was opposed
to Mr. Arden on public grounds  and
that was enough.

Mr. Inglebyby took the chair that same evening
at a meeting of Bailie Trotter's supporters,
which was held in the Baptist Chapel. His
manner towards the Bailie was coldly reserved ;
and he positively refused to hold converse with
Mr. Eobert Sanderson. The Independent
Eadical candidate and the ' Saumon lads,' however,
could afford to overlook this. Mr.
Ingieby's presence among them was all they
desired. They did not expect him to be
enthusiastic.

The meeting in the Baptist Chapel was made
up almost entirely of the Bailie's partisans.
The proceedings might even have proved
monotonous, but for one circumstance  Mr.
Laidlaw and the Sage were there. Mr. Laid-laws
looked upon the contest and the candidates

from a strictly impartial standpoint. He did
not greatly care who should prevail. But he
was determined to drink deep of the cup of
joy which only an election could offer. If he
could not prevent one of the candidates from
carrying the seat, he would at least do all that
in him lay to make them suffer in the meantime.
So he led his eldritch monitor from hall
to hall, from meeting to meeting, to supply
him with biting gibes and discomfiting questions,
to be scattered broadcast and irrespective
of party.

Bailie Trotter ascended the pulpit, and
began his speech. His manner showed at first
a certain constraint ; he seemed somehow to
have lost his usual glibness and command of
inflammatory rhetoric. This was due to the
presence of Mr. Inglebyby in the chair. To
curse Capital would be to offend Mr. Inglebyby ;
to bless it, would alienate the Mountain. The
Bailie therefore dwelt as short a time, and in
as vague language as possible, on the Rights
of Labour ; and passed on to topics where he
felt himself safe. Chief among these was the

Drink Question, for the Bailie had now definitely
cast in his lot with Teetotalism. Mr.
Laidlaw meanwhile looked on, until he saw
the speaker warming to his work, and embarked
on the full flood of oratory. Then, he
knew, was the time for an effective interruption.
The Bailie had taken a large blue-book
with him up to the pulpit, and was pounding
this as if it had been a Moderate Liberal or a
moderate drinker, while declaiming with tremendous
energy on the evils wrought by the
accursed thing. " Wha shot the hodie
 suddenly shouted Mr. Laidlaw, as
the orator paused to draw breath. What this
cry meant  to what episode in the shadowy
past it referred  was apparently a secret between
the Sage, who had prompted it, and
the Bailie himself. It had the effect, however,
of exciting Olympian laughter, and rendering
the Demagogue's face as dark as the bird
alluded to. But he soon recovered himself,
and went on with his tirade more fiercely than
before. " And on that day," he bawled, " I
stood with the deputation before the Home

Secretary  and I never stood before a nobler
man  no, nor a man whose words  " Here
Mr. Turnbull was again seized with Delphic
gasping. "Ay, Tammas?"  whispered Mr.
Laidlaw  " what isn't ? Foot wit, man ! Quick 1"
and he stooped his ear to the Sage's lips.
*' Cry til' him, Jimmy  cry, * What about the
Sierra', an' his words, when ye stood afore
him f  " Mr. Laidlaw * cried' accordingly ;
and again inextinguishable laughter made the
roof ring and the Bailie cease to roar. The
audience appeared to relish these interpolations
quite as much as they did the candidate's
eloquence. But when the speech was ended,
and a show of hands was called for, they gave
it unhesitatingly in Bailie Trotter's favour.

Mr. Inglebyby's family saw very little of
him during the two following days. From
morning to night, he was engrossed in the
work of electioneering. Mr. Ingieby, indeed,
was indefatigable, and proved himself a terrible
opponent. In whatsoever quarter he had any
influence, it was used in favour of Trotter 
or, at all events, against Arden. There was a

sombre earnestness in his denunciations and

appeals which brought many waverers to a

decision, and even shook the resolve of others

who had hitherto stood fast in their allegiance.

His two days' canvass, as Mr. Sanderson freely

acknowledged, did more for the Independent

Radical side than all their previous efforts,

even with the Infidel thrown in.

Mr. Inglebyby found the soil in a manner

prepared for him by his son's celebrated

speech, and the article in the Warden by

which it had been followed up. Mr. Arden's

friends went about talking furiously, but

vaguely, of ' outrageous slanders' and ' odious

calumnies.' Mr. Hislop would have had his

client seek legal redress. But Mr. Arden,

who had been all for such strong measures on

a former occasion, seemed, for some reason, to

shrink from them now. In reply to his

agent's suggestions, he advanced the general

principle that *rit is always better to let

such trumped-up stories die a natural death"

an aphorism from which Mr. Hislop drew

his own conclusions.

VOL. in. B

At last the eventful day dawned upon the
Happy Valley. Feeling in the town ran high ;
higher, as was natural, between the adherents
of the two Liberals than between the Liberals
and the Tories. A terrible fear lurked in the
minds of the former that, through the unholy
rupture in the ranks of light, the Boroughs
might be eternally degraded in History. The
thing did not seem likely ; nevertheless, it
was possible. The bare thought of Shawkirk
being misrepresented in Parliament by a foe of
the great Statesman who had carried away its
heart and a sample of its woollens, was intolerable
alike to the Liberal Committee and the
Mountain. Madness that way lay. They
tried to dismiss the ghastly dread, but in vain.
It spoiled for them the fierce delights of political
warfare. They could not enjoy the
election-day as they had hitherto been wont
to do.

All through the polling-day, from dawn to
dewy eve, the Shawkirk streets were in a roar.
No man spoke in his usual voice ; he-either
shouted or whispered. There were crowds

around the committee-rooms, at the street-corners,
in the bars. But the polling-booth
was, of course, the focus of excitement. It
was there that the great heart of Shawkirk
beat the loudest ; that the personalities were
most fully-flavoured ; that the ' Saumon lads'
yelled the fiercest, and jostled the voter most
spiritedly. It was there that Sandy Tennant
kept hovering about  repeating at intervals in
his loudest tones the mystic words  " Else the
poll, my lads ! Else the poll !" It was there
that Mr. Hislop, Mr. Haig, and Mr. Sanderson
took up their position, anxiously counting their
pledges as they came up to vote.

At four o'clock the poll closed. The ballot-boxes
were brought from the other boroughs
to Shawkirk by swift horses and special trains.
It was expected that the result would be declared
before seven o'clock. Lord Elvan and
Mr. Arden, at least, hoped fervently that it
might. They were both most anxious to leave
for the South by that night's express. They
both looked forward with interest to the morrow
 the one, as the first day of the Doncaster

Meeting ; the other, as settling-day on the
Stock Exchange.

Each of the three parties declared itself
confident of success. Each had exhibited,
during the day, conjectural or imaginary states
of the poll, claiming a greater or less majority.
Mr. Hislop, however, told his client in private
that he feared things had gone against them.
With the ballot, he said, there was only one
thing a man could be sure of, and that was
the attentions. Now he knew it as a fact
that a considerable number of Mr. Arden's
pledged supporters had stayed away from
the poll. He thought it on the whole most
likely that Trotter would go in by a narrow
majority  perhaps between twenty and thirty
votes.

Mr. Hislop was somewhat surprised at the
composure with which his client received these
discouraging statements. For this there were
several reasons. In the first place, Mr. Arden
could not bring himself to believe that he
would really lose the election  that such an
one as Bailie Trotter would actually be preferred

to him. Then, his loathing for Shaw-kirk
and its inhabitants had now reached such
a pitch that the near prospect of leaving the
borough for ever gave him the liveliest satisfaction
 and would do so, he thought, even
in defeat. But the chief cause of Mr. Arden's
good-humour  which had been proof even
against the trials of the polling-day  was a
communication he had received that morning
from a certain legal firm in Lincoln's Inn.
Messrs. Briggs and Barnard begged to state to
Mr. Arden that their client, Mr. Arthur Lynn,
had instructed them to pay into the London
and Westminster Bank the sum of 8000,
being the allotment money on 4000 shares in
the Loan Peak Silver Mining Company,
Limited. This news gratified Mr. Arden very
much indeed. He was not quite sure what
to make of Lynn's action in the matter. He
would have preferred to have heard directly
from Lynn himself, rather than from his
lawyers. Neither had he gained any information
on the subject from his daughter, who, for
some reason, had left his letters unanswered.

But this refunding of the money he had
advanced' for the purchase of the shares
looked well  very well. It showed that
Inglebyby's efforts to get possession of the
young man and his fortune must have failed.
Had that " sanctimonious old libeller"  so Mr.
Arden now described his opponent  regained
his former ascendancy over his nephew, Lynn
would certainly have repudiated, or sought to
repudiate, the transaction. That he had not
done so showed how much influence Camilla
had over the young man, if only she would be
sane, and exercise it properly. For Mr.
Arden did not disguise it from himself that
the ' transaction' needed to be explained  not
defended, but certainly explained. Well, a
quarter of an hour's talk with Arthur Lynn
would suffice for that, he flattered himself.
Meanwhile, there was the gratifying certainty
that Lynn had paid the money and taken up
the shares.

Mr. Arden and Bailie Trotter awaited the
declaration of the poll with equal anxiety.
The Bailie had polled all the Teetotalers ; and

his disestablishment views, together with Mr.
Inglebyby's championship, had gained him the
majority of the dissenters. But in Shawkirk,
Eadical as it was, the Church was exceedingly
strong ; and the support of the Liberal Churchmen,
in every forecast of the election, had
been reckoned a sure thing for Mr. Arden. It
was among this class that so many had abstained
from voting. The appearance of the
Infidel on Mr. Arden's platform  the insinuations
of the Border Warden as to his connection
with Mr. Lynn of Lynnfield  the
reports so industriously circulated that, in
some way or other not clearly understood, he
had defrauded or tried to defraud Mr. Lynn of
Lynnfield's son  any one of these things, by
itself, might have been passed over. But,
taken together, they shook men's confidence in
the candidate. There was something about it,
they said, ' no' right ;' and this feeling gathered
strength as the statements made by Dick
Inglebyby remained unnoticed and uncontradicted.
Mr. Inglebyby's exertions did the rest ;
and Mr. Arden lost the election. The figures

as exhibited in front of the Sheriff Courthouse
were

Trotter, . . . 1215

Arden, . . . . 1180
Elvan, 749

It was the smallest poll ever known in
Shawkirk. There had been defections from
the Tottering ranks also, due to the Bailie's
pronounced Teetotalism, which had alienated
from him many of the hands. The Tories had,
as usual, polled every man ; and never had
they come so near to victory.

Mr. Arden's disappointment was bitter and
his anger fierce at the ingratitude of the Shaw-kirk
electorate. He bluntly declined to satisfy
Mr. Turj)ie's sense of the becoming by haranguing
his rejectors. Indeed, his manner to
his supporters changed sharply, after the declaration
of the poll. It became such as
greatly to lessen their chagrin at the result of
the contest.

The Conservative candidate accepted the
decision of the Boroughs with the imperturbable

coolness lie had shown throughout. Mr.
Macritchie and his friends were enthusiastic ;
to have been beaten by so small a number
was a triumph for the Cause. But Lord Elvan
did not share their elation. He seemed to
regard the whole thing from an impersonal
standpoint. " Won by a neck, Elvan a good
third," he said ; " I fancy a roarer always does
pull these things off, down here." Like Mr.
Arden, his Lordship refused to speak to the
people. He showed himself in the streets,
however, and the people spoke to him.

Bailie Trotter bellowed his valediction from
a window of the Temperance Hotel. Mr.
Inglebyby was not there ; but Messrs. Sanderson
and Tennant, with the other leaders of the
Mountain, were gathered around the victorious
candidate. It was, said the Bailie, a great
night for Shawkirk. It was a great night for
Scotland  perhaps the greatest night since the
return of the Prime Minister himself. It was
a great night for the army of toilers throughout
the land. Henceforth there was a Voice
to proclaim their wrongs in the high place of

the nation  a Voice that would not be silenced
until redress had been wrung from the oppressors,
and the old abuses swept everlastingly
away. And the pale-faced girls and "flaccid
youths who were wearily emerging, just about
this time, from the Mastodon Warehouse,
would certainly have agreed with the Bailie
that one section of the toilers, at any rate,
wanted a Voice of the kind very badly indeed.
Deep into the night the Valley rang with
the paeans of victory and the shouts of conflict.
A quarter of a mile of Lord Leaderdale's
park-paling was torn down to form a bon-fire
in the market-place ; and round this the young
men chased the glowing hours, knit in dance
with the gay-kirtle maids of the mill. That
night no weaver lifted gun or spear. The
birds rested quiet in the dreaming woods, the
fishes in the silver stream  and the water-bailiff*
gladdened in his heart.

Chapter XXIII.

AN ANXIOUS FATHER.

"Now, my dear," said Mr. Arden to his
daughter, the evening after his return from
Shawkirk, "let us have a quiet talk. There
is no denying that the result of this election
has been a great disappointment to me.
But for that old fanatic Inglebyby, and his cub
of a son, I should now have been member for
that horrible place. But it serves me right.
It all comes of mixing up business and
sentiment."

I am afraid," said Camilla, " I cannot
enter into your feelings."

I did not expect any sympathy from you.
It was your own affairs I wanted to talk over.
Why did you not answer my letters ?"

"Because I might have been sorry afterwards

for having written what I thought of
them."

May I ask what you did think ?"
I had rather not answer that question."
Mr. Arden stared at his daughter with unfeigned
surprise.

Upon my word," he said, " you are a most
ungrateful girl ! It seems to me that since
you became entangled with that egregious
young man, you have been bewitched ! You
act and speak like a being bereft of reason.
You seem utterly unconscious of the sacrifice I
have made for you. What on earth, Camilla,
do you mean ?"

That was what I was about to ask you.
How have you made a sacrifice ?"

*good Heavens!"  cried Mr. Arden 
don't you see that I have lost a seat in the
House solely through my foolish anxiety to
promote your happiness ?"

No. I must confess I do not see that."
That is because you consider nothing but
your own desires and caprices. Can't you see
that but for this love-making, and tomfoolery,

and  and madness of yours, I should never
have been mixed up with these wretched
Inglebys ? But for you, that canting old
miser would never have gone about as he did,
moving heaven and earth to get men to vote
against me by his abominable calumnies. I
have consulted others' interests in place of my
own, and, as a matter of course, I have reaped
nothing but abuse and ingratitude. Of course,
I should have known better. But I must say
I did expect a different kind of treatment from
my daughter !"

What made you expect me to be grateful
to you for bringing a  friend to ruin ?"

To  to ruin f  Did you say to ruin f "

"Yes. You know it is that."

Oh, this is too much !"  cried Mr. Arden.
You refer to the Lone Peak ?  to the shares
which your  friend took in it, on my advice ?
Well, it seems your friend is of a different
opinion from you. He might have backed
out of that transaction  at least, he might
have tried to do so. But he has been better
advised. He has shown his confidence in

the undertaking by holding his shares  all of
them. He has acted in a most straightforward
and honourable manner, that I will say. He
has paid up like a man."

The girl's face became very white ; but
Mr. Arden observed nothing.

"Kuhn !"  he continued  "why, have I not
told you on my honour that that Mine will
make the fortunes of all connected with it ?
How can you understand such things ?  Now,
just look at this. I shall take the trouble to
make this matter clearer to you  "

I don't want it made clearer. It is too
clear to me already. I hate to speak of it.
It sickens me."

"Camilla, I solemnly declare that you will one
day bitterly regret the folly and injustice of
your words to me. I shall convince you that
you are ludicrously wrong about that mine. 
Now, just look here, at these papers  "
and Mr. Arden pulled forth a large blue
envelope from his pocket.  On the subject
of the Lone Peak, and on that alone, Mr.
Arden was a fanatic. But his daughter

refused to look at the contents of the blue
envelope, or to listen to his explanations.

"Very well," he said, in a tone of gentle
resignation; "it only proves how unjust you
are.  Now, my dear, when did you see that
fortunate youth last ? When are you to see
him again ?"

"I do not expect to see him again. There
is no longer anything between us."

"What" cried Mr. Arden. "Do you
know what you are saying ? Nothing between
you !  Oh, that is ridiculous ! After
all I have done for you ! Come, come, my
dear. You know all that is rank nonsense.
There must be something between you.
There inst, I say."

"It is a thing I shall not discuss  it is
worse than idle for you to speak of it to me.
You have made it impossible for me ever to
marry Arthur Lynn. Besides  why should
you wish me to do so  now f "

My dear, I am afraid I have misled you
by the way I have sometimes spoken of that
young man. I really believe you would be

happy with him  happier than you would be
with a clever man."

"A clever man?"

Yes  not that I mean he is a fool. I
have no doubt he has talents  no doubt
whatever. Now, if you have quarrelled, the
best thing you can do is to make it up at
once. He is fortunately the most plastic,
trusting creature I ever saw.  "

"I do not want him back, nor, if I did,
would he come. I wish you would never
speak of him to me again."

My dear, you are nearly crying, I can see
that. My poor, mad girl I  I am really more
grieved than angered by you. Tell me
plainly what you have done and what you
want  after all, you know, I am your father
and I'm sure I shall do anything for you 
that is, anything in reason."

'you can do nothing.  You know you
have sacrificed too much abbacy.  No," she
added fiercely, "there is one thing you can
do  never mention his name, Arthur Lynn's
name to me again !  But if you must, whatever

you do, don't defend him  unless you
wish to drive me mad !"

Camilla, don't become hysterical. It is
terrible to have to deal with a girl like you.
If you will only be sane, all will be well  I
shall pay out that snuffling old hypocrite yet !
Have you no spirit  no self-respect  that you
can allow that milk-and-water Miss  that
daughter of Inglebyby's  to catch  that is, to
marry her cousin ? Good Heavens ! Is he
not  is he not the  the man of your heart?"
Mr. Arden felt a twinge of shame as he
forced himself to utter this sentimentalism. 
Don't smile in that ridiculous, ironical way.
Ill simply go to Lynn and bring him straight
here again  "

"You shall not."

"Why not?"

Because, I tell you, he would not come."

Oh, stuff ! Only let me try him 1"

"I see I may as well tell you. Mr.
Dulcimer has asked me to marry him."

Mr. Arden uttered a low, long-drawn
ejaculation. His opinion of Dulcimer fell,

VOL. III.

there and then; and his daughters conduct
became at once natural and intelligible.

Oh !"  he said ; " I understand it all now.
But why didn't you tell me about Dulcimer
before ?  I should never have believed it of
Dulcimer !  Eeally, Camilla, you have not
acted fairly in this matter  fairly to your
father. If I had known that you cared more
for Dulcimer than for Lynn, I should never
have taken the trouble I have.  Of course,
you accepted him ?"

"Well, no. Not exactly. I said he must
wait."

"He must do nothing of the sort. You
must say 'yes' or 'no'  though, of course, I
see it will be 'yes'  like a rational woman. 
Dulcimer!" he repeated, "I would never have
believed it of Dulcimer  never !  Do you
know, Camilla, I thought you were mad?"

"Yes?"

"Yes. But I see now you have been very
clever. Of course, I cannot attempt to force
your inclinations, but I confess I am disappointed.
I wish you had taken the other

man. On the whole, I should have preferred
him  as a son-in-law."

I can believe that. But I have not yet
said I shall ' take ' anybody."

"My dear Camilla," said Mr. Arden, "I
am not going to have any more nonsense
understand that. I am not soinsr to have
Dulcimer unfairly used. There's a limit to
that kind of thing, you know. And remember
this  you won't find Dulcimer so pliable
as the other fellow was ; not by a long
way."

Mr. Arden recalled how far from pliable
he had found the poet in matters of finance.
Mr. Dulcimer was rich, certainly; but then
he knew so well how to take care of his
money, that it was little likely he would
ask Mr. Arden to take care of it for him.
And he would, no doubt, demand a settlement
 perhaps, even, money down. Mr.
Arden felt that Dulcimer could never be
to him what Arthur Lynn might have been.
He was by no means the ideal son-in-law ;
he would not lend himself to exploits.

Reflecting on all these things, Mr. Arden
felt it incumbent on him to give his daughter
a moral lesson.

It's rather an ugly thing you've done,
you know," he began ; ''I question if Dulcimer
is worth it. You've done your best
to break that young man's heart, and you've
cost me a seat in the House. I have thought
too little of myself, Camilla, and too much of
you, all along  "

Were you thinking of me when you got
Arthur Lynn to take those shares you wrote
about?"

'' I was  most certainly I was. Whatever
was good for him must be good for you 
that was how I looked at it, then. You
have made me a poor return  but you
mustn't repeat the performance. There must
be no mistake about your preference, this
time. I won't have it."

Camilla rose to her feet. Mr. Arden said
to himself that she was in " one of her tempers."
She was, indeed, very angry ; but
with the anger that is akin to tears.

"Oh, this is more than I can bear!"  she
cried. " My preference!  Are you only trying
to torture me, or do you really not understand
why I have done what I have done ?"

'camilla, don't be violent. It's no good.
No, I certainly don't understand you. I gave
up trying to, long ago."

"Then I will tell you. You have forced
me. I have given up the man I love  yes,
that I love !  rather than see him ruined,
sacrificed to your selfishness through his love
for me 1"

"Camilla," said Mr. Arden, "I will not
allow you to use such language to me. It
is most unjust, and  and unbecoming in a
daughter. Ruined, indeed !  when I have
doubled the man's income ! But it is quite
impossible to talk with you in your present
mood. You had better go  "

But Camilla was already gone. She had
fled to her own room ; and there, deserted
by her pride, crushed by the sense of loss
and of retribution, she gave way to a wild
outburst of weeping.

Meanwhile Mr. Arclen betook himself to
his club. " I suppose," he said to himself,
I had better get it over. It has to begone
through some time. Only I hope
Mallory is not there  I don't think I could
stand much of his infernal insolence to-night.
That girl seems positively crazed. Well, I'm
sorry for Dulcimer ! "

At the club, Mr. Arden underwent torture
by condolence very creditably. He did not
affect to deny that he was disappointed, but
outwardly he was neither bitter nor despondent.
He was bland, philosophic, judiciously
regretful, at times even mildly humorous.
Unfortunately, the Editor of the Forum appeared
while he was still in the smoking-room
of the Eclectic.

Don't overdo the indifference, Arden," was
Mr. Mallory's first remark. " That is an error
one is very apt to commit in these cases."

Mr. Arden thought Mr. Mallory was decidedly
overdoing the impertinence. His look
said as much plainly ; whereupon the Editor
proceeded to soothe his ill-starred friend.

There is one view, you know, Arden," he
said, " which you ought to take of this
election, and which is, after all, truly inspiriting."


"Indeed?"  said Mr. Arden.

Certainly. This election has shown, as
the mere return of a Radical over a Exactions
never could have shown, that the
Tory in those regions is now an exploded
feebleness, and will soon be as extinct as
the Whig  the dodo of politics. Yes, I
regard this Shawkirk election as an exhilarating
proof of the strength of the Party."

"Oh, d  n the Party," said Mr. Arden.
I've had enough of the Party."

Some people, now, might think you had
not had enough of it. But, of course, I can
excuse a certain random perversity of speech
on your part while this wound is still rankling.
No doubt, this election has cost you
a great deal."

It has," said Mr. Arden.

The result, I must own, has been a surprise
to me," continued the Editor. "You

had certainly the advantage of an admirable
Address  and I do think that, on the whole,
you had sound guidance."

'' If you refer to the advice you gave me,
Mallory," said Mr. Arden, " I can only say
that it was, in the circumstances, the worst
advice that one white man could give another
 to be perfectly frank with you."

I know that frankness is ingrained in your
nature, Arden. But you must not be too
hard upon me  I have no recollection of
having at any time advised you to enter
into politics. I always said you had a genius
for finance  but that is another sphere."

"The ungrateful boors!"  said Mr. Arden
" after all I have done for them, and spent
on them !"

You refer, I suppose, to the cup you gave
for their race-meeting ?"

"That, and fifty other things. We shall
see what that bellowing brute they've elected
will give them !"

"You were wrong about that cup, Arden.
I said so at the time. It must have been

offensive to many earnest people with votes.
You should never have stooped to countenance
a demoralising system of gambling."

'' Seeing that you countenance it yourself
daily," said Mr. Arden, "how in the name
of Creation can you speak in that way ?"

"What in the name of  ah  Evolution,
do you mean by that extraordinary remark?"
and Mr. Mallory stared at Mr. Arden in
seemingly genuine astonishment.

"Why, don't you keep a sporting Prophet
on that paper of yours ?  To be sure, he
is always wrong. If any human beings are
mad enough to 'follow' him, they will
very soon be cured of their passion for
gambling."

"Then, you see, that is altogether as it
should be," said Mr. Mallory, making, at
the same time, a mental note to have an
earnest talk, on the first opportunity, with
the unhappy seer.

"Yes," pursued Arden; "up in this room
you can hear the men all laughing at him,
any night after a big race."

These singular demonstrations have hitherto
escaped my notice' said Mr. Mallory.
But if there is no other defect you wish to
indicate at present in the working of 'that
paper of mine '  it is not mine, by the way,
but that is a detail  there is another thing I
should like to speak of. Is it true, what I
hear of Mr. Lynn ?"

'what have you heard about my young
friend?"

I am told that he has come into a fortune.
Is it the case ? You ought to know."

I heard about it when I was down in
Shawkirk  indeed, next to the election, it was
the chief subject of conversation there."

"And have you seen the young man

J)

smce f

No," said Mr. Arden, curtly.

Ah  I suppose you will drop him, now he
has ceased to be poor ?  To-day a sub-editor,
tomorrow a plutocrat !"  He paused, then
added bitterly :  " It is enough to make one
believe in Providence, to see how preposterously
money is disallowed in this world !"

"But," said Mr. Arden, "I can't see why
you should regret my young friend's good
luck ? I suppose you will be able to fill up
his place on the paper?"

The paper will continue to come out," said
Mr. Mallory; "at least, that is the present
arrangement. But I do hope, Arden, that
this melodramatic affair will be a warning
to you."

I don't quite catch the insinuation," said
Mr. Arden pleasantly.

In the event of your again suffering from
a seizure of philanthropy, and utilising the
Forum to further your  ah  charitable designs,
you must be more circumspect in your
choice of a protege. You must know him
longer  so that there can be no mistake about
his indigence. The surest and simplest plan
will be to select him from among  ah  certain
shareholders."

You seem to think I committed a crime in
trying to assist the son of an old friend.
Does the Religion of Humanity forbid you to
believe in gratitude ?"

It forbids me to believe in miracles," said
Mr. Mallory.

Look here, Mallory, we understand one
another pretty well by this time, and you had
much better let me know, straight off, what
you are driving at. I don't want a speech,
you know."

As a holder of Lone Peak stock," said Mr.
Mallory, shaking his head and arching his
eyebrows, " I am painfully aware that speech
is not silver. In that respect, I can fully
sympathise with you."

"Man alive!"  cried Mr. Arden, "do you
know what you are saying ? Sit down here 
sit down for just five minutes, and I will drove
to you conclusively the folly, the  the stupendous
folly and  and criminality of such talk !
One glance over these reports"  here Mr.
Arden drew from his pocket the same papers
in their blue envelope which his daughter had
treated with such disdain  " one glance, I say,
over these reports weill show you the utter
madness of saying clever things about the
Lone Peak Mine!"

Indeed ?"  said Mr. Mallory ; and, seating
himself at a table, he ran his eye over the
documents which Mr. Arden laid before him.

When did this  ah  this communication
reach you, Arden ?"

Only this morning. You are the first to
whom I have shown it, Mallory. And of course
you will regard it as strictly confidential."

Oh, certainly. And you have, I presume,
every confidence in your correspondent?"

'' He is an expert in such matters  a man
who never failed me yet."

'' What he says here is  ah  significant,
Arden. There is no denying that. It will
have its effect on the stock, undoubtedly."

It will," said Mr. Arden  " when I disclose
it. You will see those shares at twenty of a
premium yet, or I am much mistaken."

Mr. Arden' s blue envelope had the effect of
a talisman. It averted the threatened rupture
between the two friends. It sent Mr. Mallory
away from the Eclectic that night a gladder
and a wiser man  with a revived confidence in
Mr. Arden's genius for finance.

Chapter XXIV.

A Dress RECEPTION.

A FEW days before Arthur Lynn again visited
his birth-place, the following paragraph appeared
in the Border Warden newspaper : 

"A Romance IN Eel LiFE.

"It is our grateful task to announce to our
readers that a gentleman whom the inhabitants
of Shawkirk must regard with feelings of the
deepest interest contemplates taking up his
residence amongst us under circumstances
which we may justly designate as romantic.
The gentleman we allude to is Arthur Lynn,
Esq., the only son of our late esteemed fellow-townsman,
William Lynn, Esq. of Lynnfield,
whose beneficent endeavours to ameliorate the
condition of our proletariat are still fresh and

green in the memories of all Fall-side men.
We are in a position authoritatively to confirm
the reports which have been already circulated
that the son of our late philanthropic townsman
has become the inheritor of a magnificent
fortune, by the bequest of an Australian millionaire,
the late Gilbert Hume, Esq. of Coora-
bind, Queensland, a gentleman who was atone
time in the employment of the late Mr.
William Lynn, to whose generous intervention,
we believe, Mr. Hume was partially indebted
for his auspicious initiation into the commercial
world of Australia. The fortunate
inheritor is, we have no hesitation in saying,
a worthy scion of his noble-hearted father.
He has been an earnest and successful student
both at home and abroad, and has given
evidence that he is possessed with the genuine
poetic fire, as our readers will admit upon
perusing the following lines from a poem entitled
Perseus and Andromeda, describing an
episode of ancient Woman history, for which Mr.
Lynn gained the coveted laurel at one of his
alma matters." [Here followed an extract from

the Prize Poem which had once brought sorrow
on the soul of Mr. Tngleby.] " The gifted
author of these melodious lines at one time
occupied, we understand, the position of tutor
in the family of one of our most prominent
citizens and genial civic councillors. Subsequently
he has embarked with eminent success
on the arena of metropolitan journalism, having
previously to his accession to affluence
occupied a prominent post on the staff of our
contemporary the Forum. We believe Mr.
Lynn's talents to be of a very brilliant description,
while that he has inherited his late
father s political proclivities is evidenced by
his journalistic career. In his native town he
will find an eminently congenial environment
for the development alike of his talents and
his riches. We shrink from soaring into rash
vaticination. But while we are in every way
gratified by the wise choice of the Shawkirk
Boroughs at the recent election, and while we
look with well-grounded confidence on our
present earnest and broad-minded member,
nevertheless when we hint that on some future

occasion this constituency may find a worthy
successor to the Bailie in the gentleman to
whose advent among us we have adverted, we
believe that our suggestion is calculated to
obtain very general endorsement."

For the facts thus gracefully set forth the
editor of the Warden had been indebted to
Dick Inglebyby, with whom Mr. Small had
sought several interviews since the evening on
which Dick had made his debut as an orator.
From Dick, also, Mr. Small had obtained a copy
of the Prize Poem, with some of whose feeblest
lines he had garnished his own Attic prose.

Mr. Small' s paragraph aroused a certain
degree of excitement in the Happy Valley.
It confirmed the vague rumours already
floating about. The inhabitants of Shaw-kirk,
in their Grammar of Assent, classified
the different orders of Truth thus  Spoken
Truth, Written Truth, Printed Truth in an
ascending scale. Now that Lynn's wealth was
guaranteed by typography, they had no longer

any doubt on the matter.

VOL. ni. D

The mill-owners and other employers of
labour were not elated by the Wardens announcement.
A mad-cap millionaire, fresh
from a coterie of red-hot London revolutionists,
was coming among them to revive his father s
crusade against Capital, and with powers for
evil far greater than his father's had ever
been. The prospect filled them with disgust
and dread. " From what I've heard of this
young fellow Lynn," said Mr. Turpie of the
Townhead Tannery, " I take it he doesn't
know whether he's standing on his head or
his heels. And he seems to have got so much
money that he may do no end of mischief
here, before he smashes. Why can't he stay
and write nonsense in London, instead of
coming down here to make a row ?"  But Mr.
Macritchie took another view of his ex-tutor's
future. " He is a thorough gentleman, sir,"
said Mr. Macritchie ; "all that about his
philanthropy is a slander  a low Eadical
dodge of that low Eadical paper, sir. I have
had frequent opportunities of conversing with
Mr. Lynn on politics, and I know that when

the time comes, he will be found on the right
side  the right side, sir. He must settle here
like a Scottish Gentleman  a Scottish Border
Gentleman  and marry into a good family, a
family with good blood, sir. And I have no
doubt whatever that that is what he will do."
And the matrons of Shawkirk, as they
glanced at their daughters, and the daughters,
as they glanced at their mirrors, were quite ascertain
as Mr. Macritchie that this was Arthur
Lynn's duty, if he could only be induced to
see it.

He'll marry his cousin, mamma, and that
you'll see," said Miss to Mrs. Macritchie, in
discussing the topic of the hour  " what else
would he be coming down here for ? And I'm
sure she has waited most patiently for him 
more so than / should have done !"

I don't know," said Mrs. Macritchie a
little doubtfully ; "I never thought there
was very much in that story  though of
course things are different now. But it
was always said, you know, that young
Morton  "



 i.ir-nni-n/ r\r II I Kirtle

The sailor !" said Miss Macritchie " Oh,
no ! He got his answer before he went to sea
again, last July. I know that much. Of
course, after all those dreadful stories, he
must be off with that London girl. And
now he's coming here to make it up again
with Gertrude Inglebyby, or else I'm much mistaken."


It would be a great catch for Gertrude
Inglebyby," observed Mrs. Macritchie. " The
newspaper said a Million ! "

Money's not everything, mamma," replied
Miss Fanny. " And anyhow, papa has
plenty"  she added. Now Miss Macritchie
had been wooed, and recently won, by the
Rev. Mr. Stronach.

At last the night came whereon Lynn was
expected to return to his kinsfolk. Mr.
Inglebyby went alone to the station to meet
him. Dick had not offered to accompany his
father. He was not quite easy in his own mind
as to his cousin's sentiments towards him.
Though secretly proud of his election speech
and its results, he felt a little uncertain as to

how Lynn might regard that oratorical display,
supposing the thing to have come to his
knowledge.

Mrs. Inglebyby had insisted on making rather
obtrusive preparations in honour of her
nephew's arrival. She had decked her parlour
with muslin curtains, flowers, and china
ornaments, which seemed oddly incongruous
with its dark mahogany and dingy walls.
She had put on her best brocaded silk, and
further adorned her person with brooches,
touches, and flame-coloured ribbons. Caroline,
also, had ' dressed' for the occasion ; and Dick
had assumed a tight-fitting suit of glossy
black, which gave him the aspect of a sunday's
butcher. Thus they all sat, awaiting
the coming of their kinsman  Mrs. Inglebyby,
in a manifest flutter, now glancing at the
effect of her decorations, now appealing to
Caroline as to the ' sit' of her cap, and anon
remonstrating with her elder daughter, who
had refused to make an elaborate toilet.

Mamma, dear," said Gertrude, " I don't
think Arthur will like all this ceremony. We

never dressed for his cording before. Why
should we do so now ?"

But, Gerty dear," said Mrs. Inglebyby,
we mustn't forget that Arthur is not the
same to us as he was before. He can't be 
that is, I mean, he will be quite the same tous,
no doubt, but we can't be quite the same
to hi77i. This is such a change  you must
remember that."

"I do remember it," said Gertrude. " I
know that Arthur cannot be one of us, as he
used to be. Of course he will go away from
here, and live in another world  among
people like himself. But while he is here,
I don't think we should seem to stand in
awe of him. Nothing would give Arthur less
pleasure than that. We should try to be
just the same to him as we should have been
had he come back to us poor, instead of rich."

Bosh !"  remarked Dick.

I'm sure I don't see what harm there is
in doing one's best not to look dowdy ! " 
said Caroline, with an indignant glance at her
sister's dark coloured dress.

Oh, Caroline, for shame !"  cried Mrs.
Inglebyby.

You'd better stop squabbling, you girls,"
said Dick ; " that's the Governor's ring. Here
they are, and no mistake 1"  Then they all
rose and moved towards the door.

Dick was obviously nervous. He had his
own reasons for desiring to stand well with
his cousin ; and he had pondered deeply over
the form his greeting ought to take. It must
be at once dignified and conciliatory ; and
Dick had decided on the frank and manly
style as being most proper to the occasion.
So  " How are you, old man?"  he cried, as
Lynn appeared at the door ; but he did it
with an effort, and became at once incoherent
and abashed. Gertrude, coming behind her
mother and sister, saw a shade of annoyance
cross her cousin's face, as Dick's loud tones
fell on his ear and Mrs. Inglebyby' s bravery met
his eye. It passed instantly ; but it dispelled
the look of glad kindliness which the girl's
face had worn the moment before. Like her
father, she was startled by the change which

the months had wrought on Arthur Lynn.
He seemed to have aged suddenly; he had
lost the old, frank, eager expression ; even his
voice, she thought, had a different ring.

In the parlour, they all tried to seem at
their ease ; and they all failed. Lynn was
most anxious to be to his kinsfolk what he
had ever been. But this very anxiety helped
to defeat itself. There was a bitter sorrow at
the young man's heart  an aching sense of loss
and of wrong. Nor could he rid himself of the
recollection that those in whom he had placed
firmest trust had deceived him, one and all.
And the manner of his reception jarred upon
him. The old parlour, with which he had been
familiar from his earliest years, looked no
longer homelike in his eyes. The newly-draped
windows, the unwonted flowers on the
mantel, struck him with a sense of strangeness ;
he tried not to think that they had been put
there on his account. He was very fond of his
aunt ; he knew she was all goodness ; but he
did wish that she had received him in her
plain stuff" gown. There was a diffidence, a

suggestion almost of awe, in her manner of
accosting him which made him feel profoundly
uncomfortable. It was the same with Caroline
and Dick. Gertrude  well, she was different
from the others ; but then, she was different also
from the Gertrude who had been his friend, his
confidante, his monitress in other days. Why
could they not receive him as of old ? Even Mr.
Inglebyby, without being in the slightest degree
obsequious, spoke with a certain reserve and
dubiety of tone altogether new in their intercourse.
Lynn wished that his uncle would
begin to reproach and lecture him, as he had
been wont to do. The conversation flagged
lamentably. It was impossible to discuss
either the recent election or Lynn's London
experiences without touching on matters that
were taboo. And so, from one cause and
another, Lynn had seldom felt himself duller
or less at ease than he did on that evening of
his return to Shawkirk.

Things were no better at supper. Mrs.
Inglebyby waited until her husband had asked a
blessing upon the viands placed on the table.

Then she signed to Caroline, who rose, walked
to the side-board, and producing therefrom a
bottle of port, placed it at her cousin's
side. Mr. Inglebyby started, stared at his
wife, then at the bottle  and then, suppressing
a groan, averted his gaze from the
evil object.

You will remember, Arthur, I daresay,"
said Mrs. Inglebyby, trembling at her deed yet
proud of her temerity, "that we never take
wine nor such things ourselves. But I said to
Caroline that you would be used to having
such things, now  and so we thought we
might get this for you. It was the best the
man had."

** That was very kind of you, my dear
aunt," said Lynn ; " but really, I'm not so bad
as you suppose. I can do without such 
luxuries, perfectly well. Indeed, I have had
to do without them."  He was perplexed by
his uncle's face of woe, and by his own desire
to avoid wounding his aunt's feelings. The
thing was, he felt, ridiculous in a way; but
he was not in the least inclined to laugh. 

I know' he went on, " that my uncle dislikes
seeing anything of this kind on his
table. But as you've taken all this trouble,
aunt, and as I do like wine, I shall take
just one glass, and then we shall put it
away."

"You are well aware, Arthur," said Mr.
Inglebyby, " what my views have ever been in
regard to Stimulants. But I should not,
since your aunt has thought fit to provide 
this, I should not wish you to refrain from
taking what you may have been accustomed
to take. Though I hope that we may yet
come to be at one on this highly important
question."

Lynn thereupon sipped a glass of port, Mrs.
Inglebyby watching him the while as though
she dreaded a Bacchic outburst. The bottle
was then solemnly removed, followed by a
lingering wistful gaze from the disappointed
Dick.

I suppose, Arthur," observed Mrs. Inglebyby,
it must seem very strange to find yourself
back in this quiet old house again, after all

the grand people and fine rooms you have
seen?"

My dear aunt, I have seen no grand people
or fine rooms. A sub-editor on a daily paper
is not, as a rule, dragged into society."

But, Arthur, at Mr. Arden's "  began
Mrs. Inglebyby ; then stopped short, confused
and silent. Caroline came promptly to the
rescue.

Oh, Arthur," she said, " you'll never guess
what happened last Sunday. Fancy !  Mr.
M'Candlish made you the text of his sermon !"

"Caroline !"  said Mr. Inglebyby  "be silent;
I will not tolerate that tone of jest on such
a theme. Mr. M'Candlish's sermons are not
things to be treated lightly."

They are not," murmured Lynn.

"Mr. M'Candlish," pursued Mr. Inglebyby,
alluded to you, Arthur, fervently  and, to
my mind, touchingly  in a passage of his
forenoon discourse, last Sabbath."

As a brand snatched from the burning 
that kind of thing?"

No  not that kind of thing. He spoke of

you, Arthur, as one who might yet become,
under Providence, a helpful toiler in the vineyard
 a powerful Instrument for the furthering
of the good work."

I have no doubt he meant well," said
Lynn, a little wearily, for the thought of being
made a subject for Sabbath edification was not
much to his taste  " but the difficulty nowadays
seems to be to discover what the good
work is."

I trust and pray that you may yet be
brought to see clearly what it is. The
talents are not given us to be laid up in a napkin.
This great good has been vouchsafed
you, Arthur, to be wisely used. You have, I
doubt not, reflected seriously on all this. You
may, perhaps, during these past weeks, have
come to a decision ?"

Well, no. I have scarcely realised what
it means, as yet."

"The Warden" said Mr. Inglebyby, "has
been discussing your coming to Shawkirk.
You had better read the paragraph. Here
it is."

Lynn took the paper from his uncle's hand,
and as he read his face grew harder.

It appears," he said, as he laid down the
sheet, " that I have become a poet, a politician,
and a philanthropist. What have I done to
deserve all this ?"

"I'm sure, Arthur, you do deserve it 
every word of it ! "  said Mrs. Inglebyby.

"You will see, Arthur," said Mr. Inglebyby
who had been watching Lynn narrowly,
almost anxiously, as he read  " that the
writer of this seems to take it for granted
that you will settle down here, in your
native town."

Yes. And that I shall spend my money
after the manner of the Philanthropist. Well,
that would be one way of adding to the happiness
of the people here !"

"Arthur," cried Mr. Inglebyby, "what do
you mean ? I have neither the right nor
the desire to dictate what your future course
shall be, but I do trust  "

"I meant that if I particularly wanted to
add to the gaiety of Shawkirk, I should merely

have to set about losing all I possess. But
don't be uneasy. I have no present intention
of seeking ruin through benevolence."

But surely you are coming to settle among
us ?"  said Mrs. Inglebyby in undisguised alarm.
I have told all the people you were  and,
oh dear !  if you don't, Arthur, we shall 
that is, I shall  look so stupid ! And Caroline
and I had fixed on the very place for
you to build a villa  and I think  though
no doubt you know far more about those
things than I do  still, I do think you should
have a house with a Tower."

If ever I build a house here, aunt"'
said Lynn, " it shall have a very high tower.
What I intend doing in the meantime,"
he added, turning to Mr. Inglebyby, "is  to
travel."

Lir. Inglebyby cast a furtive glance in the
direction of his elder daughter. Then he
said sadly :

"I suppose there are no reasons why you
should not, Arthur  for a time. But I shall
look forward anxiously to your entering on

a career of earnest, useful activity at home.
You cannot spend your life in travelling.
You have now great, singularly great
opportunities for good. These I hope  nay,
I believe, you will not cast away. To none
of us, whatever our riches  to none of us
is it permitted to stand idle in the Marketplace."


No one was permitted to stand idle on
the ForvmJ' said Lynn ; "I can answer for
that. But I don't intend to be altogether
idle, even on the Continent."

That is well," said Mr. Inglebyby.

I mean to do something in the way of
writing," said Lynn. Gertrude looked up
with a bright glance in her cousin's face.
But over Mr. Ligleby's countenance there
passed a shade of disappointment.

*' Writing !"  he said. " And what, may
I ask, do you intend to write about ?"

Nothing very great," said Lynn. " It
is a series of articles which I have promised
to write from Berlin and Vienna, for the
paper."

"The paper!"  cried Mr. Inglebyby, grasping
the arms of his chair, and half-rising in his
anger and dismay  "the paper? Not that
impious  not the paper of the man Mallory ?"

"Why, yes. I am sorry if it pains you
to hear that, uncle."

"It does pain me  it pains me more than
I can say. I certainly thought, Arthur, that
you had shaken yourself free from that 
yes, from that evil association. I thought
that you had come to see clearly the selfishness,
and hypocrisy, of that  that man.
Your own words to me in London led me
to suppose so. Have you changed since
then ?  or has he ?"

I was once told, I remember, by  by a
very clever friend of mine, that there were
several Mr. Alloys. I find that to be
true."

"Oh, dear!"  exclaimed Mrs. Inglebyby.

"Yes. And the Mr. Mallory I last metis
very deeply interested in my welfare, I
assure you."

VOL. m. E

*sand do you not see the real motive of
his 'interest' in you, Arthur?"  said Mr.
Inglebyby. "Do you suppose that, but for
this change in your circumstances  "

Lynn looked at his uncle. It was a peculiar
look, and had the immediate effect of
reducing Mr. Inglebyby to silence.

'you are a little hard on Mr. Mallory,
uncle," he said quietly. " You must not
judge him, after all, as if he were a Christian.
He is consistent enough. His aim is, you
know, to raise the poor and humble the
rich. Consequently, he must not waste his
energies in seeking to aid poor men. But
when poor men become rich, he sees that
they may be helpful toilers in the Vineyard
powerful Instruments for the Good Work.
Therefore, it is his duty to guide them, and
utilise them."

"I can but partly grasp your meaning.
But I can see, to my sorrow, that whether
or not you are speaking in a serious spirit,
your heart is filled with the gall of bitterness.
It is not right, Arthur  it is not

right that it should be so. You have been
the receiver of a special bounty of Providence,
and yet you speak as one who sees no distinction
between the things that are lovely and
of good report, and things which in the eyes
of the Just"

Oh, hush ! "  cried Mrs. Inglebyby  " you
will offend Arthur, if you speak like that !"

"There is no fear of that, aunt  not the
very slightest," said Lynn, who indeed rather
liked this return to his uncle's wonted manner.
It refreshed him ; it made him feel
himself for the first time at home.

"Arthur," said Gertrude, "you have not
told us yet what you are going to write
about. You should tell us that, you
know."

"What I am going to write," said Lynn,
is merely a series of articles on the life
of the Continental workingmen  his wages
and houses and holidays, and so on. You
don't think there is any special harm in that,
do you, Gertrude ?"

"No," said Gertrude; "I don't see why

there should be. I think it might be useful
useful for the workmen here to know about
those things, perhaps."

Gertrude," said Mr. Inglebyby gloomily,
"these are matters on which no young girl
is competent to form an opinion. Those
articles of which you speak, Arthur, maybe
innocent in themselves ; I do not question
it. It is your continued association
with that unrighteous newspaper that I deplore.
I cannot bring myself to believe
that that man will exact any service which
is not, in some way, perilous to the soul."

"It's not for me to try to advise, I'm
sure," said Mrs. Inglebyby; "but you know,
Arthur, your father always went to church
it was the Established Church, to be sure,
but still  well, I mean I don't think your
poor father would have liked you to have
anything to do with this dreadful man
at least, that is, I suppose he is an Infidel.
I always forget his name."

Let us say no more about it, aunt. You
may depend on this, that I shall write nothing

that need offend any one of you. And
now, if you don't mind, I shall take a stroll
down my dear native Shawkirk  my own
romantic town. I want to call on my good
friends the Messers  the only friends I had
in the days we went a-tutoring  "

Mr. Inglebyby shook his head ; Dick just
managed to suppress an ejaculation ; Caroline
opened her blue eyes to their widest.

"Arthur, now  I don't know, you know,"
said Mrs. Inglebyby, "and of course you know
best  but do you really think you should call
on the Messers? Of course, they are very
decent, honest people  but still  "

Oh, don't do me the injustice to imagine
that I am going out of pure friendship ! I
mean to make a short study of this place and
its people  and I think I shall begin with the
Messers. It's simply as a study, I assure you
to satisfy my own curiosity."

Arthur," said Mr. Inglebyby, " I should like
you to be with us to-night at Worship. We
shall wait for you. Do you think you can be
back in, say, an hour?"

"Certainly, uncle," said Lynn; "I'll be
back in that time, without fail."

As Lynn rose to go, Dick also rose. All
through the evening meal, Dick had scarcely
spoken; but he had seemed to hang with
rapt interest on his cousin's every word, and
had watched with stealthy eagerness all the
changes of his face. His expression and
bearing now showed a certain nervous anxiety
which Lynn knew how to interpret. " I'll
walk so far with you, Arthur, if you don't
mind"  he said, in a voice which strove to be
easy and familiar ; and betrayed the effort.
Then they left the house together.

"How changed he is!"  cried Mrs. Inglebyby,
as the door closed. "There is something
wrong with him  I don't know what it is, but
I'm sure there's something wrong. Do you
think, Gertrude, that / can have said anything
to annoy or  or offend him ?"

No, no, mamma. You don't need to vex
yourself by thinking that. It's not anything
that you have said or done that has made
Arthur different."

"Oh dear!" lamented Mrs. Inglebyby  "oh
dear ! He has made me feel so unhappy !
He is not the same to us at all !" And tears
stood in the good lady's eyes.

"It's all that girl that has done it !"  said
Caroline. "I always told you what she
was  "

"Caroline!"  broke in Mr. Inglebyby, who
had been sitting in his arm-chair silent, and
apparently a prey to the gloomiest reflections
"I forbid you to speak in that fashion of
your cousin, or of that  that other person.
Indeed, you had better, I think, drop the
subject. It is one altogether profitless to
discuss."

Soon after, Mrs. Inglebyby and her younger
daughter made their retreat from the enforced
silence of the parlour. Gertrude was left
alone with her father. She looked at him, as
if expecting him to speak. But Mr. Inglebyby
said never a word. He sat there, gaunt and
rigid, his shoulders bent, his hands resting on
his knees, looking straight into the glow of
the fire from under the shaggy pent-house of

his brows. His face was dark with thought ;
now and again his lips moved, as though he
muttered inwardly to himself; he seemed
unconscious of his daughter s presence.

Presently Dick appeared. His face was
now as smiling and joyous as it had been
clouded and anxious half-an-hour before.
There was an air of chastened triumph about
Dick that told its own tale to his sister, and
made her feel sick at heart.

"Well," he remarked cheerfully, "I went
along with Arthur to the Messers'. Old
Messer got himself hurt in the mill to-day,
and Arthur's gone off for the doctor, and to
buy things. He told me I needn't wait.
Queer fellow, Arthur !"

Mr. Inglebyby showed not the faintest interest
in this intelligence. It seemed as if he had
not heard. Dick stared at his father in
amazement.

"What's up with the Governor now?" 
he whispered to Gertrude. "Is it me, this
time?"

"No," said Gertrude.

"Then, of course, it's Arthur. I say,
Gerty"  he went on in a confidential undertone,
carefully pitched so as not to reach Mr.
Inglebyby's ear  " Arthur's a trump ! I've
always said it, and I'll say it again. He's
got me out of the deepest hole I've been
in yet. He's made it all right about the
bill!"

Then you've begged the money from him ?
You've broken your promise ?"

"I never promised," whispered Dick, sulkily;
and I didn't beg the money  I borrowed it.
I offered to pay him the interest  I did, I
assure you ! Arthur's not so soft as he was,
though. He gave me no end of a jawing 
said this must be the last time, and, by Jove !
I think he meant it.  Well, money does
make a difference on a fellow  there's no
denying that."

Lynn returned in time for Worship. Mr.
Inglebyby's manner of conducting the family devotions
that night was peculiarly solemn and
impressive. The passage of Scripture which
he chose for reading was the Tenth Psalm. It

was soon made apparent to every one that Mr.
Inglebyby had selected this particular Psalm
with a purpose. He read it in a slow, deliberate
way that was not ineffective, dwelling
on its stronger passages with an emphasis that
gave to each the force of a personal application.
There could be no doubt in the minds of those
who heard him that the ' man of the earth'  the
heathen '  the * lion in his den '  the wicked
under whose tongue is mischief and vanity '
was, according to Mr. Inglebyby's exegesis, the
editor of the Forum; and that the person
taken in his devices, drawn into his net, deceived
by his crouching humility and so undone
 was none other than Arthur Lynn.
Lynn knew his uncle too well to be offended.
Neither did he find it difficult to restrain his
inclination to smile; Mr. Inglebyby was so obviously
in earnest.

"Arthur," said Mr. Inglebyby, when at last
Worship was over, and good-nights were being
exchanged  " I should like to have a few
words of conversation with you  that is, if
you are not too fatigued."

Lynn professed his willingness to talk with
his uncle as long as he pleased.

"You will have your old room, Arthur,"
said Mrs. Inglebyby; "and I do hope you will
find yourself comfortable. We have tried to
make everything nice for you, as well as we
could. And oh, Arthur  " Mrs. Inglebyby did
not finish her sentence ; but the beseeching
pressure of her hand said the rest. She was
plainly afraid lest her husband should speak
his mind too freely, and her nephew should
take offence. Lynn would willingly have
reassured her, had it been in his power. Gertrude's
manner of saying good-night to him
was, he thought, cold and constrained. Mr.
Inglebyby he could understand; his aunt and
Caroline were quite transparent; but he did
not know what to make of Gertrude. It was
as if some trouble weighed upon her mind 
some trouble which she sought to screen from
himself and from all beside. Lynn fancied
that he knew what this trouble of hers must
be ; and that he might do something to remove
it.

Mr. Inglebyby's conversation with his nephew
lasted for a full hour. After they parted, and
Lynn had retired, Mr. Inglebyby went slowly
upstairs to his daughter's room, and knocked.
Gertrude opened the door, as though she had
expected him. She was in her dressing-gown;
her rich-brown hair fell back on her
shoulders. The calm sweetness of her face
contrasted with the look of sombre care that
sat on the brow of Mr. Inglebyby.

"Gertrude," he said, "I have had a long
and serious talk with your cousin. And the
result of it has filled me with bitter sorrow.
He listens to my counsel, but I can see he will
follow his own."

You have asked him not to write for that
paper?"

I have entreated him to abandon his connection
with that man in London. And, I
grieve to say, I have entreated in vain."

"You should not press that  indeed you
should not. Let Arthur take his own way,
and don't misjudge him. Don't make him
think that you are his enemy."

"His enemy!" cried Mr. Inglebyby, "No, his
enemy .is to be sought elsewhere. That is
what I have tried to make him see, and he
will not see it."

"But, father, Arthur told you to-night
what he is going to do. He wishes to do
some good in the world  not to live in idleness,
as many would in his position. I
know that is what he means, though he makes
little of himself, as he always did. He is not
going to write as you say this Mr. Mallory
writes."

"I do not know that," said Mr. Inglebyby.
This has not been a pleasant home-coming
of his, Gertrude. It has not been pleasant
for him, nor for me, nor, I fear, for you. I
feel  yes, I cannot hide it from myself  I
feel he can never be to us as he once was.
My confidence in him is shaken."

Don't say that, father ! You are mistaken
about Arthur  I feel sure you are."

I fear not," said Mr. Inglebyby ; "I greatly
fear not. Your cousin has changed grievously.
He is soured."

No, no  he is not that ! I know he does
not really mean any of the things that seem
bitter to you. I understand him  at least, 'I
think I do."

He spoke to me to-night of you, Gertrude,"
said Mr. Inglebyby gravely.

Gertrude started slightly, and at once became
silent.

*she mentioned your name in connection
with that of  of Mr. Morton. He seemed
to imagine that  that  well, that I was
standing in the way of your happiness 
that I had forbidden you to think of that
young man. He began to praise his friend
to me."

"And  and what did you say, father ?"

I said nothing," replied Mr. Inglebyby. " I
let him go on, but I said nothing. I thought
that was best, my dear."

Thank you, father," said Gertrude. " You
have been very thoughtful for me."

Mr. Inglebyby, at these simple words, turned
away his head for a moment. Then  " Gertrude,
my dear girl," he said, "you know I

would do anything I might in duty to spare
you pain?"

'eyes I know that."

"But I must try to make you see clearly
wherein your duty as well as mine lies.
You must not  I am forced to say it for
your sake  you must no longer think of
your cousin as you have been used to
think. Indeed, the less you think of him,
the better it will be for yourself and for all
of us."

I shall always think of him as my dear,
kind, clever cousin  and never as anything
else."

"And I," said Mr. Inglebyby, "if he allies
himself, as he seems bent on doing, with the
man Mallory  if he seats himself, as I fear
he will, in the seat of the scornful  shall
think of him as one who has bartered his soul
for this world's praise  for the sound of the
tinkling cymbals !"

Father  you are doing him a wrong in
saying such things !"

You cannot change the truth, Gertrude,

by denying it. I tell you, I would rather he
had come back bent on such schemes as ruined
his father  I would rather see him scattering
his wealth broadcast, as I once feared he would
do  than have found him such as he appears !
You heard how he sneered at benevolence  at
religion ! He spoke to me to-night of being
earnest!  I would rather, far rather, he had
come back with his old carelessness, than in
this bitter, sceptical spirit."

"But, don't you see how his actions contradict
his words ? Remember, he has come
through a great grief  and carries it about
with him still. But I know that he is as true
at heart as ever."

"If," went on Mr. Inglebyby unheeding, " if
he unites himself with this proud and evil
scoffer  this Fool who has said in his heart.
There is no God  if he does this thing, he
shall be to me as a lost and fallen man  one
whom I could not permit to sojourn under my
roof, in the midst of my family  "

Oh, father !  Do not say such things!"

One whom I should bid a daughter of

mine pluck from her heart  were his wealth
greater than it is ten thousandfold. What
shall it profit a man if he gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul ?"

For about a week after his return to Shaw-kirk,
Arthur Lynn had every morning to
wade through a mass of manuscript which recalled
his labours as a sub-editor. Letters of
all sorts showered in upon him. There were
circulars from every tradesman in Shawkirk,
and appeals on behalf of charitable institutions,
far and near. The broker and the
moon-struck crotchets seemed alike to regard
him as their natural prey. Whether men
wanted a steeple or a soup-kitchen, cattle-troughs
or revivalist tracts, music for the
people or missionaries for the Jews, they one
and all cried out to Lynn to give them what
they desired. To judge from a certain section
of the begging letters, there was quite
a large class of men in Shawkirk who had

worked for Lynn's father, and had never
worked since. One of two things had befallen
each of these unfortunates. Either he had
been deprived of an arm (the right) by the
Lynnfield machinery, or he had found it impossible
to gain employment on account of
the prejudice against such as had shared in a
scheme of co-operation. Then there was a
host of letters from the ' relatives ' of the
late Mr. Hume, whose family seemed to have
been as the locust in its increase. Each of
these applicants had been led to believe that
Mr. Hume had intended to execute a will in
his or her favour, or at least to ' remember '
them in a codicil. Nevertheless, they were
far from viewing Lynn with malice. They
expressed a firm confidence in his generosity
and sense of justice. In some cases, they
were even willing to leave the precise amount
of their annuities to his discretion.

One morning, as Lynn was sifting the usual
pile of correspondence, his eye was attracted
by a large envelope with armorial bearings to
match, and the motto " Riclit marcs rich aye''

The envelope contained an invitation card of
imposing dimensions, a glittering imitation of
mother-of-pearl, which conveyed to Ljmn, inlarge
gilt letters, the information that Mrs.
James Macritchie of Deloraine House would
be At Home on the evening of the 18th, and
in smaller characters  that there would be
dancing. Lynn smiled, put aside the card,
and went on with his labours.

Meanwhile, in the parlour downstairs, the
Macritchie invitation was causing much anxiety
and excitement. Dick, Gertrude and Caroline
had each received a card ; and the question of
acceptance or refusal had, of course, to be referred
to Mr. Inglebyby.

"What is this?" inquired Mr. Inglebyby, as
Caroline laid the missive before him.

It's an invitation, papa. Gertrude and
Dick have each got one, too."

Indeed," said Mr. Inglebyby. Then he took
up the card and looked at it, handling it as
gingerly as if it had been a dynamite cartridge.
As he read, his features wore an expression
of blended indignation and disgust.

"What"  he said at last  "what, may I
ask, is the meaning of those letters in the
corner the letters K.S.Y.P.?"

"That means," faltered Caroline  "that 
that they want an answer, papa."

"Then your answer will be No," said Mr.
Inglebyby decisively. " This woman, it appears,
is to be at home on the evening of the 18th.
You cannot, it seems to me, do better than
follow her example."

Oh, papa  " began Caroline appealingly.

You will understand that my decision is
final," said Mr. Inglebyby. " You will not say
that you have another engagement, for that
would be to write the thing which is untrue.
But you may state, if you think it necessary,
that I have bidden you decline this absurd
invitation." And so saying, Mr. Inglebyby
took himself off to the Victoria Dye-works.

Caroline listened to this fiat in silent
anguish. No sooner was her father gone,
than she stole upstairs to Lynn's room, and
timidly opened the door.

"May I come in, Arthur?" she said.

''Of course, come in. But what's the
matter with you, Carry?"  said Lynn, noticing
the look of trouble on his cousin's face.

Caroline's eyes were at once fixed on the
large envelope with the Macritchie arms,
which lay at Lynn's elbow.

"Oh, Arthur!" she cried; "so you've got
one too ! But, of course, I knew you would.
It was not likely they'd pass you over !"

One what f " asked Lynn.

A card !  an invitation to the Macritchies'
ball ! I got one, and Gerty and Dick  and
and"

"AVell, Carry?"

Papa says we are not to go ! He says
dancing is wicked, and that we are to stay at
home !"  and Caroline's blue eyes filled with
tears.

Sit down. Carry, and let us talk it over.
So you want very much to go to this ball ?"

Oh, Arthur, you know how dull it is here,
and how few chances one has of meeting 
people, and how little amusement of any kind
Gertrude and I have  "

"Does Gertrude want to go as much as
you, Carry?"

Of course she wants to go, but not as
much as I do  that's impossible. Arthur, if
we are made to stay away, I think I shall
tier

"Is He to be there, Carry?" asked Lynn.

Caroline blushed, and smiled through her
tears.

I think so," she almost whispered.

"What is his name. Carry, and who is
he?"

"Mr. Carstairs," said Caroline, still covered
with blushes  "he's a lawyer  a solicitor,
they call it. He is so good-looking, Arthur,
and so clever ! He has a very good position
already, though he's only thirty  and I'm sure
he'll be at the Macritchies' ball. Are you
going, Arthur?"

I did not intend to."

"Then we have no chance," said Caroline
in despair. " If you were only to say you
were going, and that you should like us to go
with you, papa might allow us. He listens to

you more than to any one, since  since you
came home."

I don't think he'd listen to me, when we
came to talk about dancing. Have you forgotten
the arguments we used to have about
that, long ago?"

Oh, no !  and do you remember the afternoon
he caught us waltzing in the diningroom
? What fun that was ! And what a
rage he was in !"

I remember it very well. Carry."  And
there came back to Lynn the vision of the
dingy room embellished with Christmas holly
the snow driving against the windows 
Caroline seated at the piano  and Gertrude
gliding with him through that stolen waltz in
the dusk. How curiously distinct the picture
was ! The touch of his arm on his cousin's
waist, the droop of her head to his shoulder,
the red flicker of the firelight in her brown
hair  Caroline's mingled music and laughter
Gertrude's shy enjoyment  the sudden and
awful appearance of Mr. Inglebyby on the scene
he remembered all. And yet, how long

ago it seemed ! There had been no thought
of Morton, of Camilla Arden, in those days,
when he and his cousins had talked and read
and laughed together, making the dull old
house cheerful, in despite of Mr. Inglebyby.
Everything was changed now, and he felt
half-disposed to regret it.

Oh, Arthur, say you'll go !"  exclaimed
Caroline, unable any longer to endure the
suspense of waiting.

Lynn looked at his cousin, and her face of
appeal decided the matter. It was quite true
what she had said, that festivities did not
often come in her and Gertrude's way. He
had meant to decline Mrs. Macritchie's invitation.
But if his cousins' acceptance depended
on his, he would not disappoint them. That
would be too cruel.

All right, Carry, I'll go  that is, if you
go. And look here"  checking his cousin's
demonstrations of joy  " I've brought you
something to wear at the ball  something I
hope you'll like."

Lynn opened his desk, and took from it

two caskets, of which he gave one to Caroline.
It contained a pendant and bracelet
in pearls and brilliant. Caroline held her
breath as she gazed at the jewels. Words
failed her, for perhaps the first time in her
life.

This other is for Gertrude," said Lynn ;
'' do you think she will wear them ?"

Why shouldn't she?" said Caroline. ''I
know / shall ! Oh, Arthur, they are too
lovely ! How kind  '*

Don't say anything more, until we find
out whether it is to be ' go' or ' stay.' "

But you'll talk papa over, Arthur ? You
know you can, if you like ! "

I don't know that at all, Carry. But I'll
try. And meanwhile, give those to Gertrude,
with  with my love."

Arthur, do you know what we all thought,
that first night you came home ? We all
thought you were changed''

Did you, indeed ?"

Yes. But now I see we were quite wrong.
You are not changed a bit  only you're ever

SO much nicer, because  because  well, you
know what I mean !"

Yes, Carry  I think I know what you
mean."

If I'm not allowed to go now'' said Caroline,
while her eyes devoured the sparkling
gems  '' do you know, Arthur, I hnoio I shall
die''

Lynn laughed, and hoped there would be
no occasion for any such tragedy.

"I had three invitations to-day," he said
that evening to Mr. Inglebyby. " One was from
Mr. Stronach."

"From Mr. Stronach?"

Yes. He invites me to * open the first
day of his bazaar,' as he puts it. He wants
me to make a speech, in memory of our early
friendship."

"Will you go?"

I think not. My memory is scarcely good
enough for a speech like that. The next invitation
is from a Mr. Alexander Tennant,
Secretary of the Shawkirk Working Man's
Advancement Society."

'well, now!" said Mrs. Inglebyby, "there's
a piece of presumption for you ! A man of
that kind  a common slater  to write to you
at all, Arthur !"

Why, it's a compliment, don't you see,
aunt ? Mr. Tennant, in the name of his advancing
brethren, asks me to deliver the
Inaugural Address of their session. The
Society makes this request merely on account
of my well-known sympathy with Labour."

'' They are a gang of malcontents and ,"
said Mr. Inglebyby. " I trust,
that you have sent this man a firm and
pointed refusal?"

Not yet," said Lynn. " Do you know, I
rather like the notion of haranguing them?
It would be a variety. And were not these
men all supporters of Trotter, like yourself,
uncle?"

That," said Mr. Inglebyby, " was an accident.
This Tennant is one of those blind
leaders of the blind, who have only too much
power for harm in this place. His Society is
simply a focus of discontent. I trust, Arthur,

that you will do nothing to countenance these
firebrands."

We shall see," said Lynn ; " one ought to
go somewhere, you know. But I have a third
invitation  this time, to a ball."

From that absurd woman, who sent those
cards here this morning ?"

The same, I believe," said Lynn. " The
girls seem to think that you don't want them
to go, uncle?"

** I have distinctly bidden them decline
this ridiculous invitation," said Mr. Inglebyby.
You, Arthur, must of course decide for yourself."


I think of going to Deloraine House,
do you know?" said Lynn. "It will be a
study."

A most profitless one, I should imagine,"
said Mr. Inglebyby. " Did these people ever
ask you to any of their gatherings before ?"

Never  I must do them that justice."

And do you not see for what reason they
ask you now ?  that it is merely because your
position is altered ?"

No doubt," said Lynn ; *rebut we need not
discuss that, uncle. After all, why blame Mrs.
Macritchie because she has modified her views ?
She has as much right to do that, I suppose,
as you or I."

Mr. Inglebyby let the subject of Mrs. Mac-ritchie's
motives drop, and diverged into a
general statement of his views on the question
of dancing. These were of a nature to make
Caroline despair.

Lynn said no more for the present, but left
it to his aunt and cousins to work on Mr.
Inglebyby's mind, which they did assiduously
during the next three days. Caroline did her
part by assuming an air of meek sufferance,
which she had never known to fail with her
father, in the long-run. Mrs. Inglebyby at first
based her appeal on the ground that the *' poor
girls should have a * chance,' like their neighbours."
But * Arthur' was Mrs. Inglebyby's
main prop in all her arguments and persuasions.
Arthur wished to go ; but would not,
without the girls. Arthur, she was sure,
would give up the idea of addressing these

horrid working-men, if Mr. Inglebyby yielded to
him on this point. How could they expect
Arthur to endure the humdrum life of Shaw-kirk,
without some occasional distraction such
as the Macritchie ball would be? This last
argument had its weight with Mr. Inglebyby.
As to life in Shawkirk not being good enough
for Arthur, that was, of course, absurd. But
if this invitation were accepted, it would detain
Arthur among his relatives for another
week ; whereas, if it were rejected, the young
man might depart next morning for London 
and Mr. Mallory. Mr. Inglebyby had not yet
despaired of his nephew's reclamation. Arthur
had seemed more reasonable, more open to
advice, since their last talk together on the
subject. Much might be done in a week to
wean him from that ruinous association. Mr.
Inglebyby resolved on making another attempt.
It was not in accordance with his views of life
that his daughters should go to a dancing-party.
But Mr. Inglebyby was prepared to
stretch a point, if thereby aught could be
done to redeem his nephew from the thraldom

of the Forum, When Lynn, urged on by-caroline,
again broached the subject to his
uncle, he found himself, to his own surprise,
successful in his suit. An acceptance was accordingly
sent to Mrs. Macritchie, and a
refusal to Mr. Alexander Tennant.

Lynn found the days before the ball hang
somewhat heavy on his hands. His aunt and
Caroline were preoccupied with the great question
of Dress. Gertrude's behaviour towards
him perplexed, and even pained him. She
was, as she had ever been, quietly thoughtful
for his wants, interested in his interests,
and ready to listen to him whenever he chose
to talk. But he noticed that she never gave
him the opportunity of being alone with her.
It seemed as if an end had come to all their
pleasant, cousinly intercourse. Lynn was conscious
of no change in his own feelings with
regard to Gertrude. He had looked forward
to dropping into their old, easy, familiar relationship
; to giving her his fullest confidence ;
to seeking her sympathy and counsel. But her
strange reserve, her evident shrinking from all

allusion to the past, the way in which she kept
him, as it were, at arm's-length, at first puzzled,
then piqued him. Even in the midst of his own
troubles, which gave him sufficient material
for reflection, Lynn found himself engaged
in making a study of Gertrude, watching her
with a kind of sorrowful interest. She must,
he thought, have some trouble on her mind 
a trouble akin to his own. Morton's sudden
return to a sea-faring life was the only thing
he could think of, by way of explanation. He
would scarcely have thought Morton the man
likely to win the love of such a girl as Gertrude
Ingleb} He recognised all Morton's
good qualities ; but he did think that his
cousin would have sought something more from
a lover than Morton could give. Still, as
Lynn reflected, d priori reasoning is of no
use in questions where a woman's heart is
concerned. It must be Morton, for the simple
reason that it could be no one else.

What could be the reason of his cousin's
unhappiness?  for that she was unhappy he

VOL. HI. G

could see. A lovers' misunderstanding? 
that was scarcely probable between these
two. More likely Mr. Inglebyby had interfered.
Already, in talking with his uncle, he had
sought to find out whether it were so ; and
Mr. Inglebyby's way of putting the question by
had seemed to give colour to his suspicions.
A deep pity for his cousin filled Lynn's mind
as he came to this conclusion. He himself,
in a similar case, could seek distraction in
work, in change of scene, in mingling with the
world. But she would have to bear her heart-sorrow
as best she might through the dull
routine of life in a provincial town, where the
slow days dragged their length monotonously
on, and such a thing as this Macritchie ball
became an event of the first magnitude.
Yes, he was sorry for Gertrude. Sometimes
he forgot his own unhappiness in thinking of
hers.

For Lynn, in those days, was unhappy.
No doubt, wealth had brought to him its
consolations. The power to dispose of one's
own life in one's own way, unconditioned

by the need of what Mr. Inglebyby called
bread winning,' had a charm of which the
young man was fully conscious. He had
realised that on the very morning after Mr.
Inglebyby's revelation ; if ever he entered the
Forum office again, it was solely because he
chose to do it  not because he had to earn
a livelihood by sub-editing. And the advantages
of his new position became more
evident each day.

But the thought of his lost love embittered
the novel and pleasurable sensation
of being rich and free. Again and again
he went over in his memory that last interview
with Camilla in the garden. To
what extent had she been in her father's
secrets, and in his plot ? Had the girl been
harden's accomplice, his decoy and confederate,
or only  as he himself had been  his
dupe ?

Sometimes Lynn was disposed to take
the more charitable, sometimes the harsher,
view. Yet either supposition, he felt, left
her conduct, her words, to some extent

enigmatic. She had dismissed him, poor ;
she had called him back to her, rich  so
much at least was certain. And she had
thrown him over in the end  for Mr. Dulcimer.
That he could not understand. Mr.
Dulcimer was no doubt a man of fashion,
who dressed well, went into good society,
and had a certain air of distinction and
superiority which might impose on a silly
girl. But Camilla, whatever she might be,
was no silly girl ; and he had heard her
laugh too often and too genuinely at the
poet's affectations to think it possible that
these could have won her heart.

The other alternative was to suppose that she
meant to marry Mr. Dulcimer for his money.
That would have been Lynn's conclusion, but
for the fact that Camilla had known about
his fortune before he knew about it himself.
Why, if she were utterly heartless and mercenary,
had she not played out her game
to a successful end, as it had been in her
power to do ? Arguing thus with himself,
Lynn came to take a somewhat more lenient

view of his former sweetheart's behaviour
towards him.

Of Mr. Arden he thought only with indignation
and disgust. The parade which
that gentleman had made of his ' gratitude
his professions of disinterested friendship,
his simulation of kindly interest
and regard, angered and outraged Lynn
more even than the ' transaction ' which
had made him a principal holder of Lone
Peak stock. He wanted to be done with
Mr. Arden at any price. Father than be
mixed up with him and his affairs  rather
than have the use which he had made of
his own daughter discussed and exposed 
Lynn had risked the loss of a considerable
portion of his newly-inherited wealth. He
did not regret the sacrifice, which he had
made in part on Camilla's account  to the
complete mystification of Mr. Inglebyby and
of his legal advisers.

He wished to forget, if possible, all that had
happened since that night when Mr. Arden
had come to him amid the ruins of his father's

factory. But in this he failed. He could not
forget Camilla. Neither could he forget the
plausible phrases and calculated kindnesses by
which he had been beguiled and fooled.
His faith in the better side of human nature
had received a rude and painful shock.
Often, during his London days, it had pleased
while it somewhat surprised him to find how
good everyone was to him in spite of his
poverty. Now that the true motives of such
goodness stood revealed  now that he knew
himself and was known to be rich  he was
inclined to look with suspicion on every
manifestation of good will.

His experience of Shawkirk had not tended
to restore his confidence in human kind.
He had become, in truth, heartily sick of
the place and its people. He did not class
his relatives among the sycophants whom his
wealth had drawn around him. But neither
did he feel himself comfortably at home in
his uncle's house, as he had been wont to
feel. He knew that his uncle meant to say
something more to him on the subject of

the Forum letters ; and that, not improbably,
they would have a quarrel over it. He did
not want to quarrel with Mr. Inglebyby ; but
he had no intention of giving up the plan
which seemed the only definite thing in his
immediate future. But for the fact that
his going would have deprived his cousins
of a rare enjoyment, he would have left
Shawkirk ere now. Each day he became
more impatient to depart. He resolved that
the day after the Macritchie ball would be
his last in Shawkirk, at any rate for the
present.

As they drove up to Deloraine House on
the eventful evening, they beheld that mansion
in a blaze of light, from the basement
to the topmost chamber in the tower. They
stepped out on a red cloth, which had been
laid over the gravel of the ' approach' ; passed
through the hall, where lighted candles flickered
among the armour and the antlers, and
bowers of evergreens and exotics had been
symmetrically arranged at regular intervals ;
and so up the great staircase.

Isn't Macritchie doing the thing in style !"
said Dick, as he and Lynn waited on the
handing for the two girls. '' It's quite nobby,
don't yoii know?" he added, surveying the
magnificence around him. " And all in your
honour, old man ! If you hadn't come to
Shawkirk, there would have been no ball.
Everybody says so."

These remarks filled Lynn with dread.
Were they going to  lionize ' him ? He
had not discounted this possibility, and
began to regret the hour when he had consulted
Caroline's wishes rather than his
own.

His reflections were cut short by the appearance
of his cousins. Gertrude, in her ball-dress,
almost startled him. He had never
before thought her exactly beautiful ; but
now he saw that she was so  not with a
haute de diable, but with a winning loveliness,
a simple unconscious grace of manner
and carriage  that beauty which lingers in
the memory like a strain of music or the
perfume of a flower. For long after, Lynn

recalled his cousin as she appeared to him
just then  the coils of rich-brown hair round
the shapely head ; the veiled lustre of the
dark eyes ; the red lips that seemed redder
from the slight paleness of the face, parted
in a smile of animation and expectancy, for
this was the girl's first ball. Lynn was glad
to see that she was wearing his jewels ;
he scarcely knew why. He no longer regretted
having accepted Mrs. Macritchie's
invitation. Giving Gertrude his arm, he
passed through the lace-curtained doorway
into the drawing-room, while Caroline followed
with her brother.

Dancing had not yet begun. A string-band
from the city, ensconced among evergreens
on a platform in one corner of the
room, sat with their music before them,
ready to strike up. The ladies were ranged
on red-cushioned forms round the room ; the
men stood grouped together here and there ;
they all seemed to be waiting for something.
Mrs. Macritchie, enthroned on her
chair of state, had also the air of one

who waits. Lynn became dimly conscious
of all this  of a hush that fell upon the
guests, and a concentration of eyes upon
himself  as he passed up the room, with
Gertrude on his arm, to make his bow to
their hostess.

No sooner had that ceremony been gone
through, than Mr. Macritchie bore down
upon him, and his worst fears were more
than realised. Mr. Macritchie positively
bubbled over with geniality. He stood for
some minutes shaking Lynn by the hand,
expressing the joy it gave him to see Lynn
under his roof, "on this festive occasion"
to see him "restored to his true position
in Society." There were quite a number
of people in the room, said Mr. Macritchie,
whom he really must introduce to Mr. Lynn ;
people who had come to this ball expressly
to meet him. There was Turpie of the Town-head
Tannery, and Purdie of the Cambridge
Mills, and various others  the magnates of
Shawkirk society; men who had known Lynn's
father in former days, and now yearned to

make the acquaintance of Lynn himself. All
this was bad enough, Lynn thought ; but
there was worse to come.

We have been waiting for you, Mr.
Lynn," went on Mr. Macritchie, passing
his arm affectionately under his guest's.
Will you open the ball with Fanny  with
my daughter? That will be the proper thing,
you know."

Lynn started, looked round him in alarm,
and said something about appreciating the
compliment, and having intended to dance
the first dance with his cousin.

Oh, you will have lots of chances of
dancing with your cousin before the night's
over, Mr. Lynn ! And besides, I see you are
forestalled. That's young Purdie with Miss
Gertrude  a very decent fellow, young Purdie ;
not bad-looking, and a partner in his father's
concern already. Excellent position in society,
young Purdie's. And there's Miss Caroline
off with young Carstairs  know young Carstairs
? Second son of Carstairs of Ladywell,
the Was.  place near here  splendid legal

connection, that. Fine-looking fellow, isn't
he ? Seems very attentive to Miss Caroline,
doesn't he ?  ha ! ha ! Now, Mr. Lynn, come
along. You haven't seen Fanny yet, and you
must open the ball with her. There is an
etiquette in these matters, you know  a
custom, I may say, handed down to us from
our forefathers. Your position, my dear sir,
in a way imposes, yes, imposes this  shall I
say, duty?  upon you. Noblesse oblige, you
know," said Mr. Macritchie, exhausting his
French ; "my dear sir, noblesse oblige''

Lynn resigned himself to his fate, and
walked through a quadrille with Miss Mac-ritchie.
Thereafter he had the Shawkirk
notabilities presented to him by Mr. Mac-ritchie
; and then their wives and daughters
by themselves. Lynn's sufferings during this
levee were very great. One stout old man after
another was led up to him, saluted him with
profound respect, and congratulated him on
his accession to wealth, just as if he had done
something very grand and heroic. Some of
them made allusion to their acquaintance with

Lynn's father in former days ; and this jarred
upon the young man more than anything else
in the proceedings. The impression which hein
his turn made on Shawkirk society was not
altogether favourable. His manner was felt
to be 'haughty.' This, however, helped to
confirm the exaggerated reports as to the
magnitude of Lynn's fortune. The young
man who could afford to treat a personage like
Mr. Turpie so cavalierly must be, at least, a
Millionaire.

After dancing with one or two partners
provided for him by Mr. Macritchie, Lynn
began to think he had had enough of it. He
looked about for his cousins. Caroline was
being whirled through a waltz ; Gertrude was
just rising to dance. He made his way towards
her.

"Will you give me the next waltz,
Gertrude ?" he said.

Gertrude looked at her card. Every dance
was initiated. Lynn cursed his own negligence
in not making his request before. Now
that he saw his cousin among the other young

ladies of Shawkirk, he began to wonder why
he had not done so.

I'll sit out the dance before supper with
sou, if you like, Arthur," said Gertrude; 'Til
make some excuse  it's Mr. Purdie, and I've
danced with him before. Will that do ?"

That will do very well, Gertrude. Then
I shall have the waltz after supper with you.
And now I shall have to dance with the
young lady that Mr. Macritchie is bringing
along  the young lady in the dress ' like the
sound of a trumpet.' You see her ?"

Gertrude laughed; and next moment was
rapt away from him in her partner's arms.

Lynn danced with the young lady in
scarlet, and with many other young ladies.
To do so was his only way of escape from Mr.
Macritchie, Mr. Stronach, and the Tories
and Parties, who hovered about, eager for the
honour of addressing him. At last came the
dance before the supper.

Gertrude," he said, " this room is insufferably
hot. Let us go down into the hall,
where the greenery is."

Gertrude took his arm, and they seated
themselves in one of the bowers, where they
were screened from observation.

"It is the instinct of the hunted animal
that has brought me here," said Lynn ; " this
seems a pretty good covert, do you know ?"

"Tm afraid you have not been enjoying
yourself very much, Arthur."

At any rate, I am now  if only our host
does not unearth me. I know he means to
set me some dreadful task ; probably to take
in Mrs. Macritchie to supper. Now, I think
I did my share in ' opening the ball.' I don't
want to take in Mrs. Macritchie. I'd much
rather take in you, Gertrude. May I ?"

'' Of course you may, Arthur, if you
wish."

"I do wish," said Lynn. He had taken
Gertrude's fan, and was fanning her as she
lay back on the settee. How different she
looked, he thought, from the quiet girl, in the
dark stuff gown, whom he had watched moving
about his uncle's house during these last
days ! What was it that had changed her 

that had made her beauty appear ? Not only
the dress, the jewels, the flowers in her hair.
It was the excitement of the ball that had
brought the colour to her face, the sparkle
into her limpid grey eyes ; that gave to her
every motion the vivacity that had been
wanting before. What might not Gertrude
be, he thought, if only she were taken out
of her dull surroundings  if only she were
permitted to see and to enjoy a fuller and
richer life ! He began, half-consciously, to
compare her with Camilla. Both were beautiful,
though in a very different style of beauty.
Both were, as to character, very much what
circumstances had made them ; he might
plead that in Camilla's defence. But Gertrude
could not have been guilty of deceit, however
tempted ; he felt sure of that. How different
things might have been with him, if 

"Arthur, you are forgetting to fan me.
How deep in meditation you are !"

Lynn looked into the girl's face, so earnestly
that her eyes drooped beneath his
gaze.

'' I was thinking about you," he said. " You
have quite puzzled me to-night. You are
transformed !"

How do you mean ?"

"Well, you seem quite another person
from the demure young lady I've been used
to of late.  Now, why don't you ask me
which I like best ? Any other girl than you
would have done that !"

Well, I will ask you."

I think I like you better as you are now.
Do you know, Gertrude, I thought you had
been  well, distant, rather, to me, since I
came back to Shawkirk ? You made me think
I had said or done something to offend you ?"

How could you think that ? You don't
know how glad I was to see you that night
when you came in with father, and found
us all waiting to receive you ! And you have
been so good and kind, and patient, with all
of us."

Don't say that, Gertrude."

But it is true. About Dick"

VOL. Ill, H

"Oh, don't speak of that!"

"No, I will not. It makes me ashamed.
But I am so grateful to you, for all that !
And though I'm afraid I did not thank you
properly for your lovely present  "

Lynn took his cousin's hand, and looked at
the bracelet that encircled her arm.

Do you know," he said, " I felt quite
relieved when I saw you wearing this? I was
afraid that you might not  might not have
liked to take it?"

Why should I not, Arthur?"

Oh, I don't know. It was an absurd
notion, of course."

Lynn did not explain to his cousin that he
had thought it possible she might not care to
deck herself with the jewels which had not
been given her by her lover.

"I took them," said Gertrude, "just as if
they had come from my own brother. Just as
Caroline did."

Of course," said Lynn. " Yes, that was
right. I should like to talk with you, Gertrude,
just as we used to talk in the old

days. I have had no chance until now, and
this is likely to be my last."

'your last?"

Yes. I leave Shawkirk tomorrow. I
have had a letter from Mr. Mallory. He
wishes to see me, and I shall go. Your father,
I know, will not like it, but I think it the
right thing for me to do."

You must do what you think right. It
would be selfish to wish to keep you here."

I want to do something," said Lynn ; "or,
at any rate, to try. I find that having a
fortune left one is not an unmixed good.
The people here seem to think that simply to
have money is quite enough. They have
dinned that into my ears until I am sick
of it."

I know it is not enough for you."

"I hope not  I do hope not. I used to
have ambitions, as you know. I used to think
a great deal, and to speak sometimes, about
what they call a Career. Am I to give ups
all that, just because I don't need to work any
longer for my daily bread ?"

Surely not. I do like to hear you speak
in that way, Arthur !"

I know that you will understand me. My
uncle does not, and perhaps never will, though
I know he means me well. If ever there was
a time when I needed to be doing something
when I could not sit down and enjoy the
mere use of money and the sensation of being
rich  that time is now. Of course you know
what I mean ?"

Yes," said Gertrude.

'' But I don't want to talk about myself. I
want to talk about you."

"About me?"

Yes. I have eyes to see, Gertrude, and
they say that sympathy makes us clear-sighted.
I don't want to force your confidence.
But it has seemed to me that you must
have a trouble like  like my own. I have no
right to speak to you about such a thing ; I
know that. But I thought  I thought that I
might be of service to you. You know how
willing I should be ! "

Gertrude did not speak. Lynn fancied

that she shrank from him, as if displeased.
She had taken her fan, and now raised it so as
to screen her face from his view. Lynn began
to feel sorry for having spoken ; but thought it
best, since he had begun, to go on.

I thought, you know, that if there were
any misunderstanding, I might do something
to clear it up  or if there were any  any
objections, I might do something to remove
them. I have not made you angry with me,
Gertrude?"

Oh, no. You have not done that."
That is what I meant to say, though not
the way I meant to say it. But can't you make
use of me in any way ? Is there nothing 
nothing that I can do ?"

Nothing !" she said  " nothing !"
But," persisted Lynn, now more certain
than ever that he had been right in his conjecture,
" if you want help at any time, Gertrude,
you will come to me ?  you will send
for me ? Remember, I would go anywhere to
serve you. I should like you to promise me
that."

Don't  don't talk of it any more. I cannot
promise you  but you must not think me
ungrateful. Indeed, indeed, I am not that ! 
See ! There they come downstairs to the
supper-room. Let us go."

Lynn, without a word more, gave her his
arm, and led her forth. He was sorry now
that he had spoken ; he could have wished his
words unsaid. He feared that he had given
Gertrude pain, instead of comfort, as he had
intended. He could not but remark how the
gaiety had quite gone from her look and
manner, since his unlucky reference to her
relations with Morton. He had been wrong
thus to spoil her enjoyment of the present
hour  to make their last talk together, perhaps
for long, a thing she could not remember with
pleasure. He set himself, while ministering
to her wants at table, to win back the smile
to her face, and in a measure succeeded. But
it was, he felt, only in a measure.

At supper, Lynn noticed a curious change
pass over Mr. Macritchie. The champagne
flowed like water, and the jest and laughter

grew loud around him. But Mr. Macritchie
sat silent and preoccupied ; and his hand
shook as he raised the wine-glass at frequent
intervals to his lips. A dark suspicion of
what those symptoms might portend crossed
Lynn's mind.

Gertrude," he said, " have you marked our
host of late ? Do you notice anything peculiar
about him ? "

'eyes. How pale he is ! Do you think he
can be unwell?"

I fear not. I may be mistaken, but I
gravely fear he is about to have a relapse of
oratory. It all comes of the election, I suppose.
Only observe him !  "

Mr. Macritchie, with cheeks ghastly pale,
and lips tightly compressed, gazed for some
moments abstractedly into space. Then he
drank two glasses of champagne in swift succession,
rapped on the table, and rose. It was
even as Lynn had foreseen.

'good Heavens!" said Mr. Carstairs to
Caroline  "the man is going to make a
speech /"

The talk and laughter ceased at once. Mr.
Macritchie coughed an overture, and began : 

'' Ladies and Gentlemen : There are occasions
in a man's life when he cannot remain
silent  when he is compelled to give inadequate
expression  I mean, expression however
inadequate  to the sentiments within his
breast. This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one of
those occasions."

Here Mr. Macritchie stopped abruptly, and
there was for some moments a tingling silence
in the room. At last the orator resumed, with
striking glibness : 

It will no doubt be as agreeable for you to
fulfil the request I have to make of you as it
is agreeable to me to make it. And I have no
doubt that the sentiments I am about to
express will prove to be vibrating in harmony
with those of all those whom I now see before
me."

A burst of applause rewarded this effort,
and Mr. Macritchie became absorbed in a

study of the champagne bottle, whose neck
he had grasped mechanically in his right
hand. He strove, for some time in vain, to
recall the sentence at the top of the second
page of the speech in his pocket ; and again
sought inspiration from the wine-cup.

'' We all know. Ladies and Gentlemen, what
the Poet says  that  well, that there are
flying hours, and that we are to  well, to
chase them, you know  with  with glowing
feet, But why should I detain you from the
giddy dance with these reminiscences ? There
is one thing, and only one, which I shall ask
you to do  to unite with me in paying a well-merited
honour to the gentleman whom I am
proud  yes, proud to see at my Board tonight.
Mr. Lynn"

Here Gertrude, finding her own fears thus
realised, cast a glance at her cousin's face.
Lynn sat motionless, looking, fixedly and
grimly, straight before him. She glanced at
him from time to time during the remainder
of Mr. Macritchie's speech ; but he took no

notice of her or of any one, and his expression
and attitude never changed.

Mr. Macritchie halted and stammered
through about five minutes' speaking ; referring
to Lynn's talents and his wealth ; to the
distinctions he had won in his university
career ; to his place in the world of letters ;
his auspicious return to his native town, and
the pure joy it gave him, Mr. Macritchie, in
common with all who now heard him, to welcome
back, elevated to his true rank in society,
the son of one whom many of them had
known and respected. He would not dilate
on this subject. He would conclude  and
Mr. Macritchie' s relief on reaching a coherency
was obvious  he would conclude by asking
them to drink to the health of Mr. Arthur
Lynn.

Mr. Macritchie sat down amid loud applause,
and the toast was duly honoured. Then Lynn
rose to reply. There was an evident curiosity
to hear him, especially among the Tories and
the Parties  who imagined that Lynn might
take the opportunity which Mr. Macritchie's

reference to this father's schemes had afforded
him, to developed his own views on philanthropy,
co-operation, and kindred subjects.
He was so rich ! And he could do, if so
minded, such a lot of harm !

Outwardly Lynn seemed as cool and self-possessed
as Mr. Macritchie had been the
reverse. Inwardly, he was execrating his own
mistake in ever going to Deloraine House, and
his blindness in not forecasting the manner of
his reception. His speech should be short ;
and his exit thereafter immediate. He would
leave Shawkirk next morning ; he would go
somewhere, among people who did not know
of his money, or would forget about it ; he
would not stand this kind of thing for another
day. His irritation and annoyance were no
doubt greater than the occasion warranted ;
but he felt as if all his trials of the past fortnight
had culminated in Mr. Macritchie' s
speech.

Mr. Macritchie, Ladies and Gentlemen,"
he said, " I have been trying to discover to

what I can be indebted for the honour of having
been selected as the victim of this solitary
toast. No one of you can be better aware
than I am that it is not due to any merits of
my own  that it is not in recognition of anything
that I have done ; because, as those of
you who know anything at all about me must
know, I have consistently done nothing. It
is true, as our host has said, that I have gone
through the antiquated course of studies still
prescribed at our Universities. But these
studies cannot, of course, be regarded as Work
in the now recognised meaning of the word,
being totally opposed to the spirit of the age,
and having no pecuniary results worth mentioning.
All earnest men, we know, mean by
work the production of money ; and I should
be insulting your common sense if I supposed
you capable of accepting any less practical
definition."  " What does the fellow mean by
that?" here whispered Mr. TurjDie to his
neighbour.  " Casting about me for some
reason," continued Lynn, " for the honour
you have done me, I have come to the conclusion

that it must be on account of the
name I bear. In the very flattering speech of
our host, and the equally flattering reception
you gave it, I see a proof of your sympathy
with the efforts of Philanthropy."  Here Mr.
Turpie started violently, and emitted an ejaculation
which reached Lynn's ears, and gave
him a cue.  ' Some of you," he went on,
may have heard that, through no efforts of
my own, I have become the unworthy possessor
of  well, of a sum of money sufficient
to insure me independence  in other words,
idleness. Various suggestions have been made
to me regarding the disposal of this sum of
money. Numerous outlets for capital have
been presented to my choice. As yet I have
not decided on the matter ; but one may be
allowed to have one's dreams. I was standing
to-day among the ruined walls which my
father built ; and the thought came to me 
What if these walls could be raised again ? 
if the machinery could once more throb and
pulse within them?  and if the name of
Lynnfield could prove to the world that the

interests of the employer and the employed
are one?"  At this Mr. Turpie groaned
audibly, and Mr. Purdie's face grew pale. 
It was, I know, a dream and nothing more.
But though I do not pledge myself to carry
out those philanthropic schemes which have
failed once, but might succeed again, the
reception you have given me to-night is an
incitement and an encouragement. I shall
never forget it, and I thank you for it from
my heart."

There was loud applause as Lynn resumed
his seat ; but the faces of his audience wore,
for the most part, an expression of anxious
bewilderment. The general impression of the
capitalists was that Lynn had shown traces of
a crazy ambition to woo poverty after the
manner of his father. They felt a certain
resentment against Mr. Macritchie. He had
always assured them that the younger Lynn
had quite escaped the taint of philanthropy.
He had led them into drinking Lynn's health
under false pretences.

Capital speaker, your cousin," said Mr.
Carstairs to Caroline, as they returned
to the ball-room. "He has given them a
fright. They quite missed the irony, you
know."

Oh, it's only his chaff," said Dick, when
questioned as to his cousin's intentions by
some of his intimates. " There's nothing in
it. He's not such a precious fool."

As for Lynn himself, his one desire now
was to get out of the house, and to escape
from Shawkirk. This latest episode had put
the finishing-touch to his irritation. In his
angry impatience, he forgot to claim the waltz
which Gertrude had promised him.

Gertrude," he said, " good-night  and
good-bye. I am going."

But why say good-bye, Arthur?"

Because I shall have left Shawkirk before
you come down to breakfast tomorrow  or
rather, this morning. Say good-bye for me
to Caroline. I suppose I may trust to Dick
to bring you home ?"

Oh, yes. Good-bye, Arthur."

Good-bye, Gertrude. I shall write you,
whenever I have anything to say. Now,
dance on and be happy. Good-bye."

And he passed downstairs, and out of the
house.

CHAPTEK Xxvi

AN ESCAPADE.

Lone Peaks ' were now rising in the market,
and with them rose Mr. Arden's financial
reputation. There had been a time  while
the Shawkirk election was in progress, and the
prospects of the mine were at their gloomiest
when 'whispers' had made themselves heard
in certain circles, concerning Mr. Arden and
his affairs. But now these were silenced ; or
rather, changed into a murmur of applause.
The reports of which Mr. Mallory had enjoyed
a private view, issued later in the form of a
circular to the shareholders, brought about the
belief that the mine was a real mine, with
veritable ore. So much faith men had in Mr.
Arden's ' expert,' who was a man of note in
VOL. in. I

his way, and had plainly stated what his eyes
had seen. But the circular, by itself, was not
sufficient to send up Lone Peak stock. The
mine, no doubt, was there ; but the money to
work it was not  so at least people said. The
expert had spoken of splendid possibilities ;
but without money these could not be
realised ; and where was the money to come
from ? The capital had been all expended,
and fruitlessly ; so much was known. The
new stock had at no time been in demand;
and it was not thought that Mr. Arden and
his co-directors either would or could throw
capital into the undertaking sufficient to make
it pay. Thus even the reports which Mr.
Mallory had pronounced ' significant ' left the
stock much as it had been before.

Then it oozed out that in some way money
real money  had been put into the concern
; and that the mine was being developed.
Humour had it that a great Capitalist, who
had been to Nevada and had visited the mine,
had shown his confidence in its success by
taking shares to the extent of forty  fifty 

a hundred thousand pounds. Mr. Arden did
not contradict these statements ; he only
smiled, and declared them to be ' exaggerated.'
 Lone Peaks ' came gradually into demand.
A sale of ore was talked of, to be followed by
a dividend at the rate of 15  20  25  x percent.
Mr. Arden smiled, and said that these
forecasts also were 'exaggerated;' and his manner
of saying so heightened, in whomsoever
heard him, the desire to become possessed of
Lone Peak stock. Each day saw the stock
quoted at a higher figure. At last it stood at
par. Then Mr. Arden felt that he had
triumphed  with the help of Arthur Lynn.

The Lone Peak silver mine had ever held
the first place in Mr. Arden's affections, and
did so still. But there was a more recent
Project which had come to stand second in his
regards, and on which he was now bestowing
the utmost of his energy. The suggestion of
this project had come from no less a person
than Mr. Mallory. And it necessitated a meeting
between the Editor of the Forum and Mr.
Bonnamy Fowler, M.P.

Mr. Fowler was a well-known City man, and
a director in sundry solidly-established companies.
Financially, he was spoken of as ' a
tower of strength'; so specially, indeed, had
this epithet become his own, that he was
known among his intimates as ' Old Babel.'
Mr. Fowler sat for a rotten borough in the
South of England, which had frequently fallen
under the editorial scourge of Mr. Mallory.
But Mr. Fowler bore the wielder of the scourge,
personally, no malice ; and Mr. Mallory, for
his part, was quite prepared to sink the
Member in the (City) Man.

Mr. Fowler was a man of middle age, and
something more. His hair was black, his eyes
were cavernous. He never spoke in the
House, and rarely out of it. When he did
speak, his words boomed away from his lips
as if his voice were a thing entirely beyond his
control. The meaning of his speech seemed
to dwindle cloudily in the volume of superfluous
sound. To deliver an epigram with
such a voice would have been as idly ineffective
as the discharge of a needle from an Armstrong

gun. But Mr. Fowler never spoke in
epigrams.

Mr. Mallory and Mr. Fowler were to meet
for the first time, on the common ground of
finance, at Mr. Arden's dinner-table. It was
to be one of Mr. Arden's ' little dinners.' The
ladies of Mr. Arden's family knew well what a
little dinner ' meant. It meant, as a rule,
almost no conversation during the repast, and
a late appearance of the gentlemen in the
drawing-room afterwards  sometimes no such
appearance at all. It was understood that
business on these occasions preoccupied the
guests and made them silent, until the ladies
had retired. But with Mr. Mallory at the
table, there was not much risk of silence.

Mr. Mallory sat down to dinner in his
worst temper. The first person he had seen,
on entering Mr. Arden's drawing-room, had
been Mr. Dulcimer. That Mr. Dulcimer
should be of the party was more than he could
tamely bear. He had not come there to listen
to sickly nothings ; he had come to talk confidentially
with two financiers on a matter

which then lay nearer his heart than all others.
He looked on Mr. Dulcimer's presence as a
distinct breach of faith on the part of Mr.
Arden ; and took no great pains to conceal his
ire.

Mr. Arden himself was quite as much
annoyed as the Tribune by this untoward addition
to his guests. He could not, under present
circumstances, be otherwise than civil to
Mr. Dulcimer ; but he owned to himself that
he had [of late had a good deal more of that
gentleman's society than he could enjoy. Mr.
Dulcimer was there that evening on the invitation
of Mrs. Chevenix, not on his ; had he
known of it, he would have dined the M.P.
and the Editor at his club, instead of at his
house. Mr. Arden swore, inwardly, at the
meddling old fool '  Mrs. Chevenix. It was
she who had placed him in this false position
who had compromised him in the eyes of
Mr. Mallory and Mr. Fowler. Had he designed
to play a practical joke upon them,
there would have been need of nothing more.

Mr. Fowler, for his part, was deeply perplexed

by finding Mr. Dulcimer in that house.
He had heard from Mrs. Chevenix that the
young man was a poet. Poets he believed to
be, as a class, dishevelled and insane. Mr.
Dulcimer was the reverse of dishevelled ; but
he seemed, at all events, to possess the latter
qualification. But what was Arden, of all
men, doing with one of these unfortunates at
his table ? What operation of preternatural
subtlety could this portend ? There were, he
reflected, such things as rhymed advertisements.
Could it be that Arden had decided
on carrying this idea into his mining and
other prospectuses ? Could this strange youth
have been retained to sing up shares in the
market ?

During dinner, the Editor's wrath was
fanned by Miss Arden s persistence in addressing
him. She seemed resolved that the conversation
should be general  that Mr. Dulcimer
should not have the chance of whispering
honeyed trivialities in her ear, under cover of
the thunder of Mr. Fowler s voice, and the
silvery cadences of Mr. Mallory's.

Few things gave Mr. Mallory less pleasure
than Miss Arden's remarks. He disliked her,
because he could not despise her. She ought
to have been a fool, and was not. She had
opinions of her own, which was bad. And,
what was almost as bad, she did not believe
in woman's rights  in other words,
did not care for the right of listening reverentially
to him, Mr. Mallory, while he declaimed
on woman's wrongs. On various
occasions she had offered to sing or play to
him, as if he had been a lovesick appealing
an offence not to be forgiven. And she
had discovered a chink in the editorial
armour. Of music and all that appertains
thereunto Mr. Mallory was intimately ignorant.
He was well aware, of course, that this
reflected great credit on himself But he
did not like to have it discovered that there
was anything under heaven which he had
not carefully weighed before finding it wanting.
Now Miss Arden seemed to find a
malicious pleasure in beseeching his opinion
on matters musical.

"To talk" said Mr. Mallory, thus assailed
"to talk of extracting any meaning from
music is absurd. You might as well talk
of extracting money from moonlight. I look
upon a musician as a social fungus. There
is a deep truth in the old myth which
represented  ah  well, an Individual who
once had a great fall in society  as the
First Violinist. This worship of sound merely
deafens its devotees to the world-wail of
Humanity."

I don't think I should like to hear that,"
said Miss Arden ; "I fancy the street-organs
are preferable, after all."

It lulls men into oblivion of their wrongs,"
Mr. Mallory swept on. " Look at the Italians
when they wished to allay a revolution at
Naples, they had merely to bid the bands
play. Look at the Germans  no people has
sung more songs about liberty, and no people
has ever had less of it. Music !  it is a social
narcotic  a Lethe-flood of sound for the Serfs
to lave in. There may be talent among
the music-lovers  I do not know; but they

have, at all events, ' small talent for freedoms'"


"They didn't allay a revolution with the
Marseillaise, did they?"  inquired Miss Arden
innocently.

"As for that man "Wagner of whom you
spoke," Mr. Mallory went on, "I heard his
Trilogy at Bayreuth  and all I can say of
it is this, that it almost made me a good 
ah  Catholic."

"How  how was that?"  inquired Mrs.
Chevenix, startled by the word.

It converted me, madam, for the moment
to a belief in the Catholic  ah  Inferno.
Amid that chaos of discordant sounds  that
braying of the trumpet and the kettle-drum
I actually thought myself there''

Mrs. Chevenix shivered. She did not
express the thought which Mr. Mallory's
words had suggested.

The Editor was for a time silent, considering
what topic was most likely to prove unpleasant
to, at least, any two of the party.
At last he spoke.

"By the way, Arden, I saw a friend of
yours to-day  my late  ah  sub-editor, Mr.
Lynn."

"Indeed," said Mr. Arden. "I thought
he had vanished altogether. Did he tell
you where he had been ?"

Mr. Mallory saw that the topic was disagreeable
to four of his auditors, and naturally
pursued it.

"He has been at  ah  Shawkirk, Arden
his native town, you know. He calledon
me at my office to-day, and we had a
most interesting conversation. I was deeply
gratified by that young man's demeanour.
He has very greatly improved."

It would be strange if , he had not,"
said Mr. Arden, "with all that money left
him."

"You think so?"  said Mr. Mallory.

Lynn ?  money ?"  thundered Mr. Fowler
"that's not the same man who holds that
big lot of Lone Peaks, Arden? Man was
speaking to me about him in the City,
to-day."

"The same," said Mr. Arden, with something
less than his usual suavity.

"Must be a clever fellow, that," continued
Mr. Fowler. "Went into the thing at the
right time. Should like to meet that fellow.
Perhaps we may see him in the City, one of
these days."

"That is unlikely," said Mr. Mallory. "If
you want to meet this young man, Mr. Fowler,
you will have to go to Charing Cross an hour
or two hence  he leaves to-night for Paris.
He intends to travel, in the meantime."

Looking out for investments ?"  suggested
Mr. Fowler.

No  he has had enough of that. Do you
know, Arden, I was really impressed by the
broadening effect of riches on your  ah 
young friend ? I spoke to him of his future
career of his making an entrance into the
literary and political world. Yes  he is a
young man who will yet go far."

How far does Mr. Lynn intend going ?" 
asked Mr. Dulcimer.

"On the Continent," replied the Editor,

"he proceeds by Paris to Vienna. You
might meet him there, Mr. Dulcimer, in,
say, a fortnight. In literature, he will proceed,
I believe, to the first rank. You will
ah  hear of his arriving there, Mr. Dulcimer,
some ten years hence or so. In the
meantime, he and I have resumed our old
relations. He has re-enlisted under the inky
flag of journalism."

Mr. Arden shot an admiring glance in the
direction of Mr. Mallory, and a smile crept
round the corners of his mouth. Mr. Mallory,
with that Project in his view, must be playing
the same game that he  Arden  had
played. But Mr. Mallory' s way of going
to work was, he felt, "a cut above him"
there was a finesse, a depth, a delicacy
of touch about it, to which he could not
aspire. Mr. Arden owned that to himself,
and honoured the great Editor.

But Mr. Dulcimer was far from smiling.
The one thing that could have deepened his
abhorrence of the Editor had been done. Had
not Mr. Mallory sung the praises of his 

Mr. Dulcimers  former rival in the presence
of Camilla? And had not Camilla
seemed to hang with rapt interest on the
Editor's words ? Mr. Dulcimer became pale
with rage.

"So soon!"  he sighed; "so soon! You
pain me, Mr. Mallory, more than I can
say. Poor Mr. Lynn ! "

"I am sorry to have pained you, Mr.
Dulcimer," said the Editor, "as I fear I
have done by my reference to Mr. Lynn.
But  pardon my dulness  I don't quite see
what it is that makes Mr. Lynn an object
of compassion in your eyes ? "

Can it be "  went on the Poet  " can
it be that he has already lost his all ?"

"If you mean his money, permit me to
point out to you that, in Mr. Lynn's case,
money is not his all. Neither, so far as I
know, has he yet lost it."

You relieve me," said Mr. Dulcimer, " but
without lessening my surprise. I did not
think it possible that any human being,
however  eccentric, should have gone back

to the bondage of journalism while possessing
an independence. That was my meaning.
It may have been a fancy  a vain
fancy of mine. But it came to me."

My dear sir," said the Editor soothingly,
'you must not give way to those sorts of
fancies  you really must not. The collective
sense of Humanity has, on such questions as
this of journalism, pronounced a Fiat against
which there is no appeal. In face of that Fiat,
an individual prejudice is as impotent as the
thistledown against the granite. No one, for
example, understands why he should be consigned
to a mad-house. Still, his prejudice is
of no avail against the decision of the sane
majority.  I need not say, of course, that I
adduce this merely as an instance."

"Talking of mad-houses," interposed the
deep-voiced Fowler, " I did very well in a
mad-house, very well indeed."

Mr. Dulcimer shuddered. Mrs. Chevenix
turned icy cold, and fixed a fascinated gaze on
Mr. Fowler's knife.

"Yes," continued the M.P.; "did I ever

tell you, Arden, about that mad-house they
started down in Hampshire, that I went into ?
I'm out of it now, you know  got out of it in
the nick of time, but it was a good thing while
it lasted. Father a queer story, that  " and
Mr. Fowler then proceeded to relate his lucrative
experience as shareholder in a joint-stock
private asylum. The conversation went on
for some time on the same lines ; but before
the ladies rose, Mr. Mallory had contrived
to revert to the talents, fortune, and bright
prospects of his late sub-editor. Mr. Mallory
was speaking now with a purpose in view beyond
that of exasperating Mr. Dulcimer.

"Mr. Lynn, you see, Arden, will not be
idle abroad," said Mr. Mallory.

Indeed," said Mr. Arden. Mr. Arden was
prepared to stand a good deal from Mr. Mallory,
but the Editor's tacit assumption that he
must be deeply interested  still  in Lynn's
fortunes, was trying to his patience.

"No," went on Mr. Mallory, "he will not
be idle. He intends to make a study of the
working-classes in the great foreign towns, and

we have arranged for a series of letters in the
Forum, regarding the various stages of vice
and wretchedness in which their rulers compel
them to exist. These letters will afterwards
be published in a volume, which will no doubt
be prized by all earnest political students.
There is just one slight obstacle in the way.
Mr. Lynn tells me that his German is not so
good as it might have been. I am afraid that
when he lived on the Continent, he made a too
common mistake  frequented the society of
his countrymen and  ah  countrywomen,
more than was  ah  for his good."

Mr. Mallory, as he spoke, glanced across
the table at Miss Arden. The glance was
almost imperceptible, but Camilla knew that
Mr. Mallory was watching her, and, for some
reason of his own, had been talking at her.
Slowly the blood mantled on her cheeks.
Despite herself, she raised her head, and
looked for an instant with a kind of defiance
at Mr. Mallory. Then Mr. Mallory felt quite
sure that he had not been talking in vain.
He allowed the subject to drop ; and con-vol.

III. K

descended to listen for a time to Mr. Fowler's
financial reminiscences.

Camilla," said Mrs. Chevenix, as they went
into the drawing-room, " what is wrong with
you to-night ? You were looking quite flushed
a minute ago, and now you are as white asa
statue. Are you unwell ?"

Oh, I don't know. I suppose I must be.
That man always gives me a headache."

*' I don't wonder at it. But Mr. Dulcimer
was there, my dear."

"I think I shall go upstairs. Aunt Elizabeth,
and bathe my face. I know I am looking
a perfect fright. I can hardly keep my
eyes open."

"A cup of strong tea"  began Mrs.
Chevenix.

"Yes, yes. I shall be down in a few
minutes. You can keep Mr. Dulcimer amused,
aunt, until  until I come."

Don't be long, my dear. These men will
be talking their horrid business for an hour to
come, and Mr. Dulcimer will expect you to
give him some music."

Camilla went upstairs to lier own room.
She was trembling all over, and the throbbing
of her temples was almost a pain. She cast
one glance at the reflection of her face in the
mirror ; it was white as a statue, as her aunt
had said.

With eager haste she took the jewels from
her wrists and throat, slipped the rings from
her fingers, and exchanged her dinner-dress fora
plainer garment. Over all she threw a
mantle lined with fur  the same she had worn
that winter at Leipsic, and in which she had
walked, driven, skated, along with Arthur Lynn.

Was there time ?  Dinner had been served
at an earlier hour than usual, to suit Mr.
Mallory : and Mrs. Chevenix had understood
too well what was required of her, to sit long
over dessert. It was now not much after
eight o'clock.  Charing Cross, that man had
said. She had no very distinct idea of the
time it might take to drive there. But there
was at least an hour to spare  more, perhaps,
for she had some notion that the train left
between nine and ten.  Yes, there was time.

Silently she hurried downstairs, and past
the door of the dining-room. She could hear
the voices from within. In the hall there was
only French, the impassive. She made a sign
to the man, who opened the door for her  as
if she were doing the most natural thing in the
world, in going out unattended at that hour 
without a word or a look of surprise. But
when the door was shut, French gave expression
to his thoughts in a long-drawn, significant
whistle ; and retired forthwith to the servants'
hall, big with news.

The night was frosty, but not clear. A
vaporous haze filled the air, and gave it a
chill clammy feeling that made Camilla shiver
in her furs. She dropped her veil over her
face, and almost ran down the garden. Then
she walked swiftly eastwards.

A hansom passed her before she had gone
a hundred yards, but she could not summon
up courage to hail it. Trembling with excitement,
almost terrified by the strangeness of
her situation  for she had never before found
herself alone in the London streets by night 

she hastened on, choosing her way almost at
random.

Presently another cab appeared  a four-wheeler
this time, crawling along close by the
kerb. One thing was plain to Camilla  that
if she was to carry out the purpose she had
formed, she must not go on any longer on foot.
Time and strength alike were failing her, and
already she had lost her way. She stopped the
cab, and bade the man drive her to Charing
Cross station  fast.

Up to this point she had acted altogether
on impulse, unthinking, careless of consequences.
Day by day since she had parted
from Lynn the longing to see him again had
grown upon her. Mr. Mallory had seemed
to her the mouthpiece of Destiny. Those
chance words of his, lightly spoken, were asa
call which she must obey. Lynn was to
be near her that night, before going beyond
her reach, perhaps for ever. The prompting
to seek him, to meet him once more, had
become irresistible. She had not sought to
resist it.

But now she began to hesitate. She was
being driven very slowly towards her fate.
All right, miss"  the man had said, when
she had bidden him drive his fastest ; but
his fastest proved to be a tardy trot. She
doubted whether it were possible to reach the
station in time. One touch on the check-string
 and she might be home again before
her flight had been discovered. Her aunt
would be still asleep in the drawing-room 
her father would be talking business over his
wine  Mr. Dulcimer  no, she could not go
back to Mr. Dulcimer. His attentions had
become to her at all times little short of torture
; and that evening they had been specially
marked. She dropped the check-string,
which she had taken in her hand. No, she
would not go back ; come of it what might,
she would act on her impulse. However cold
Lynn might be, he could not, knowing her ashe
did, despise her more deeply because she
had come to bid him farewell, and to ask his
forgiveness. One thing at least she could tell
him  that never, never would she marry Mr.

Dulcimer  and that, in parting from himself,
she had been striving to expiate rather than
to heighten the wrong she had done him. 
How would he receive her ? What would he
say?  She kept herself from thinking about
that. And yet, when she had wrapt herself
in those Leipsic furs, when she had slipped
the jewels from her fingers, a wild hope had
flashed across her mind that made her cheeks
burn, as she strove to crush it down and hide
it from herself. If he had suffered, had not
she suffered too ? Was her offending past
forgiveness or forgetting ? Might not his happiness,
after all, be bound up inseparably with
hers ?  She strove to banish such thoughts
from her mind. It was no such anticipation,
she told herself, that was taking her now to
where she might see him and speak with him ;
but simply an impulse which she could not
control.  Her father had told her she was
mad. Well, she was giving him reason to say
so. He would be angry, furiously angry, she
knew that. And Mr. Dulcimer ?  She began
to think of what, even now, might be happening

at Hartington Gardens. Would they
guess whither she had gone ?

What happened at Hartington Gardens,
after Camilla's departure, was this.

Mr. Dulcimer had not dallied long over his
wine, after the ladies retired. " Thank Heaven,
he's off at last !"  Mr. Arden had said, as his
intended son-in-law muttered something about
music," and quitted the room  " now we
can talk that business over at our ease. I
think, Fowler, we had better let Mallory explain
his project. Then you can ask him, orme,
any questions that occur to you."

When Mr. Dulcimer entered the drawing-room,
he found only Mrs. Chevenix, sleeping
peacefully in an easy chair before the fire.
This was, as Mr. Dulcimer knew, her habit on
all occasions when he was there ; and he
glanced approvingly at his slumbering ally,
without the slightest desire to awaken her.
The piano stood open, with a music-book on
it ; doubtless Camilla would immediately appear.
There was a portrait of her in the
room  a head in crayons, exquisitely done 

and before that Mr. Dulcimer took his stand,
in an attitude of traced adoration. Ever
and again his head was raised towards the
picture ; but as the minutes passed fruitlessly
on, an expression of impatience began to alternate
with the look of dreamy rapture which
Mr. Dulcimer's features promptly assumed, at
each fancied sound of a footstep or opening of
a door. Camilla ought certainly to come, and
at once, to witness this proof of his devotion.
She did not come, however, and the Poet's
mood passed from surprise into irritation.
The pose was effective, but fatiguing; and
finally he had to give it up.

Mr. Dulcimer was now very angry. He did
not wish to arouse Mrs. Chevenix, as Camilla
might appear at any moment. So he sat in
silence, and nursed his wrath. This was not
the kind of treatment which Mr. Dulcimer
considered his due. He was in love with
Camilla  very much in love, he thought. But
he was not going to tolerate her caprices beyond
a certain limit. She had come near that limit
on sundry occasions abbacy ; now, decidedly,

she had overstepped it. Mr. Dulcimer knew
his own value ; the usage that might do for
such as " that fellow Lynn," would not do at
all for him. Camilla must be made to see
that. He had been, perhaps, too tamely subservient
; he had accepted his fair lady's
whims too much in the courtier spirit. That
must henceforth be changed. He would show
her that he still laid claim to his liberty. He
would threaten her with the loss of what she
thought herself to hold so securely. He
would bring her to her senses.  How should he
make manifest his high displeasure ? Should
he quit the house there and then, without saying
a word to anyone ? Would that be a
dignified manner of proceeding ?  Mr. Dulcimer
thought that, on the whole, it would.
Nearly an hour had passed since he came upstairs
; he had already waited far too long 
he would wait no longer.  He rose to go  and,
as he rose, the other gentlemen entered the
room. Mrs. Chevenix awoke with a start.

'what, Dulcimer" said Mr. Arden " all
alone? Why, where's Camilla?"

The Poet did not answer. Mrs. Chevenix,
with a startled look which everyone noticed,
said something about going to see what had
become of her  and went. The minutes
passed ; a general feeling that something was
wrong began to pervade the group in the
drawing-room ; still Mrs. Chevenix did not
return. Presently French glided into the
room, and said to Mr. Arden that Mrs.
Chevenix desired to see him.

One would think the house was bewitched
!"  said Mr. Arden angrily. He
apologised to his guests, and hurried upstairs.
In his daughter's room he found Mrs. Chevenix,
now on the verge of hysterics.

Now, then," he cried, " will you tell me
what the Devil you mean ? What have you
done with that mad girl ? What's the matter
now?"

'' Oh, Eobert !"  murmured Mrs. Chevenix,
did I not warn you ? Did I not warn you
against that man ?"

What man ? Where's Camilla ? That's
what I want to know !"

That that Infidel ! It's all the doing of
that wicked man downstairs !  that unbeliever
!  that " 

Oh, confound it !"  broke in Mr. Arden.
Once more, I ask you, where's my  "

Here his glance fell on Camilla's dinner-dress,
lying a crushed heap of white drapery
on the floor ; and on the rings and bracelets
that were scattered about the dressing-table.
"By Heaven!"  he cried  "she's gone off
with the other fellow, after all !"

Yes  that's what she has done ! Oh,
dear 1 What will Mr. Dulcimer say !"

"D  n Mr. Dulcimer," said Mr. Arden.
Mrs. Chevenix put her fingers to her ears.

Mr. Arden did not speak for some minutes.
He was inwardly reviewing the situation.

"Where do you suppose she has gone?" 
he said at last. "Be rational, now. Don't
stand gibbering like a lunatic, but just tell me
what you know  and be sharp about it !"

Did you not hear what that wicked wretch
said at your own table  I believe on purpose
to make mischief  about the train from

Charing Cross, for Paris ?  and about that 
that insolent Scotchman, that you would
bring here ?"

"Lynn?"

"Yes  Lynn. She has run away with him,
I know it !  She has brought disgrace upon
us all !"

Stuff" said Mr. Arden. " It takes two
to run away, and that young fellow is not
mad, though she is. But you ve made a nice
mess of it, between you !  Now, look here,
this is what I shall do. I shall go after her,
and bring her back quietly. This must be
hushed up at all costs, and if I find you letting
out a word of what you know, by the Lord  "

But what am I to tell these people downstairs
? What am I to say ?"

Tell them any lie you please," said
Mr. Arden. "But stay  you'd better leave
Dulcimer to me. Send him out to me  111
make it right with him. Now, will you look
sharp?  It's nine now, and the train leaves
at nine twenty-five. There's not a moment
to spare !"

But it was too late to " make it right" with
Mr. Dulcimer. That gentleman had already
left the house, after exchanging a few words
with French in the hall  left it, not intending
to return. Mr. Arden surmised as much ;
and set forth, furious, in quest of his runaway
daughter.

A few minutes afterwards, Mr. Mallory and
Mr. Fowler left Hartington Gardens together.
Mr. Mallory, without much difficulty, had
elicited the facts of the case from Mrs. Chevy
In her agitation, she had even let it be
seen what share in the matter she ascribed to
Mr. Mallory.

Mr. Mallory's enjoyment of the recent
incident was tempered by the thought that,
should this scandal get into the society
journals, his name might possibly be mixed
up with it. This was the view suggested to
him by Mr. Fowler.

"Say!"  boomed Mr. Fowler, who had not
neglected his host's wines  '' know what they'll
say ? They'll say you were the young people's
go-between ! Never thought of that before !"

"I don't see why you should think of it
now," said Mr. Mallory.

"Well, the old lady seems to have got
some notion of that kind into her head, you
know. And I do remember your saying
something about the station, and this Linton,
or whatever his name is, going away. These
newspaper fellows get hold of everything
nowadays. Shouldn't wonder a bit if they
said you'd a hand in it."

Mr. Mallory shuddered. "It is a topic I
cannot discuss," he said frigidly.-" A !
Good God !"  muttered the Tribune
to himself, as he walked away to his office,
after bidding Mr. Fowler adieu.

Meanwhile Camilla had reached the station.
She had come too soon, and the necessity of
waiting took away from her all the courage of
impulse. Passing into the white glare of the
electric lights, she was seized with a nervous
dread of recognition. It seemed to her
excited fancy as though the place had been
lit up expressly that all eyes might behold
her in her humiliation. For she felt it now a

humiliation to have come to such a place on
such an errand ; and yet, having come, she
found herself unable to give up her purpose,
and go back. She was scared by the spectral
brilliance, confused by the hurry and noise,
by the throng of moving figures and their
shadows, black and defined. She shrank
away from the crowd to a quiet place, by herself
; and waited, trembling.

The time passed on, and the stir on the
platform increased. She made a resolve.
She would find out the train ; go once and
back again along the line of carriages ; then,
if this search proved fruitless, she would
return home  abased only in her own eyes.

This she did ; moving along the line of
carriages, but without finding in any of them
the face she sought. The impulse which
urged her to be gone was now as strong upon
her as ever that which had brought her from
her father's house had been. She turned, and
walked swiftly away from the platform.

Two gentlemen came straight towards her,
walking leisurely, arm-in-arm. They were

talking and laughing together. Camilla's
heart gave a wild leap within her. She
had recognised one of them. It was Lynn
himself.

"And as I was telling you, Vaughan" 
she heard him say  " I had to open the ball
with the man's daughter  "

The words were a shock to Camilla, in her
present mood. Instinctively, she turned aside
her head, and drew her veil more closely over
her face. She would not have him recognise
her ; and yet  with an inconsistency of which
she was scarcely aware  she made a little
pause. Lynn's glance fell upon her ; he knew
her at once, in a moment. He started
violently ; the words died upon his lips ; and
he stood motionless before her.

'good God" he said. "Is it you
Camilla?"

Mr. Vaughan dropped his friend's arm, and
walked slowly down the platform.

I  I came to say good-bye "  faltered
Camilla. " I heard only to-night, by chance,

VOL. III. L

that you were going away. I wanted to see
you again, to say  good-bye."

** Good-bye "  said Lynn ; but she did not
offer him her hand, and neither of them
moved.

"And there is something more I wanted
to say to you  something I have wished to
ask you, ever since that night when I . . . .
Oh, Arthur, do you think you will ever 
not now, but after  be able to forgive me ?"

"I have done it," said Lynn. "The last
time we met, Camilla, I thought too much
of myself. I said things that I was sorry
for afterwards  "

"They were true  all true !"

"Perhaps, but I should not have said
them. Since then  during these last weeks
I have thought more of you."

"How  how have you thought of me,
Arthur?"  The tone in which she asked
this question was so low he scarcely heard
it. He could see that she was trembling.

"Why did you come here to-night, Camilla?
 why did you come? You do not

know how much harder you make it forme
to bear  what I have to bear !"

"I came because I must. I could not
help it. Are you angry with me for coming?
 Do you despise me more deeply than
you did before ?  Say what you will  I
cannot blame you."

'' Camilla  you wring my very heart when
you say such things ?"

"I had to see you  if only for once 
after. . . . Arthur, you cannot think I knew
of it ?  that I knew what  what my father
had done?"

"If you say you did not, I shall believe
you."

"I did not  I could say that if it were
with my latest breath ! I have been wicked
mercenary  I have deceived you. But that
of that I was innocent ! . . . . Say that you
believe me, Arthur, for pity's sake !"

In her agitated pleading, she had laid her
unloved hand on his sleeve. Lynn could
feel how it was shaking ; and a great compassion
for her filled his heart.

I do believe you," lie said. It was all he
could trust himself to say.

I could not bear to have you think that
I had a share in  in robbing you, Arthur.
Oh, yes  that is what it comes to  let me
call it by its proper name 1 . . . . That was
why I said those things to you, the last night
we met. I never meant to marry that man
I do not mean to marry him, or  or anyone.
The shame of it all had made me mad,
I think. I wanted to send you away from
me, so that you would never come back 
never care to see me again. I thought myself
stronger than I am, you see  else I
would not be here. You told me that
night that I had made the past as bitter to
you as the future must be. Did you mean
that?  Do you say so still?"

"How can I say otherwise? Is it not
too true ? "

"And do you think that I, too, have not
suffered ?  that the future is not as likely to
be bitter for me as for you ?"

What do we know about the future ?

It may be that neither you nor I shall ever
find happiness again  or it may not be. But
it can do no good, Camilla, to me, nor to you,
to speak of what has been between us in the
past."

*' No good?"

"None. You know what you once were
to me  what you once made my life forme.
I shall never know anything so sweet
as the old days were  that I will tell you.
But I look on those days as gone  past
recalling."

Past recalling ?  Arthur, I see you are
unhappy  as I am. You used to'' tell me I
was very proud ?  See what I have come to !
I am shamed in my owen eyes. I am shamed
in yours."

No  a thousand times no !"

'arthur, I have done you a great wrong.
I have deceived you  I have twice sent you
from me  but I loved you through it all ! If
you could see into my heart, you would
believe it  you would know it ! . . . . Yes, it
is right that I should sacrifice my pride. I

do it for your sake, believe me, more than for
my own.  Arthur, can't you understand me ?"

Camilla," said Lynn, speaking very gently,
and in a voice as low as her own had been,
"if I offered you my love again, and you
took me at my word, I could not, Camilla,
I could not trust myself. It would not bethe
old love. It would be another passion,
and in time it might bring great sorrow onus
both. This may seem to you hard and
cold  but it is true. Do you know, at this
moment I feel I could give all I have 
all this money that has lost me you  if we
could only be to one another as we were
when I was a penniless student ? If you
had been less to me in the past  I don't
know  it might have been otherwise. But
I have loved you too well, too dearly  to let
me offer you the only love I could offer now."

"That is enough," said Camilla; "goodbye.
I was told lately that I had gone
mad. After what I have done to-night
I begin to believe it.  Oh, no, no !"  she
cried in a changed voice  " I have no right

to speak so  I have deserved it all ! But
I had to see you again, Arthur  and now
you understand me better, a little better
than you did  don't you ? You won't think
so meanly of me, when you think of the past
at all?"

' I shall think of you as you were on the
day we first met  floating down that quiet
German river in the twilight  when I looked
into your eyes, and knew. . . . No, I cannot
bear the thought of it ! Camilla, why  why
did you not trust me fully, as I trusted you ?
If you had, we should not now be saying
farewell !"

He took her hand in his ; and the mere
touch of it roused a feeling within him that
threatened to sweep away the barrier of his
self-control. The dusky splendour of her
eyes, now languorous, now burning  the
music of her voice, that had once thrilled
his very being  the subtle fragrance that
hung about her  the very furs she wore 
how well he knew them !  was not this the
Camilla of the old days  the same Camilla ?

Where was the change ? He did not release
her hand, and a great wave of emotion began
to swell within him. To reject her, now
that she had come back to him thus  would
it not be an act at once cold-blooded and
quixotic ?  Why should he choose a cold and
colourless life, because he knew that his love
could be no longer the exalting, spiritual
passion it had once been ? Why should he
sacrifice the real to the ideal?  It was true
that Camilla had deceived him, that his faith
in her could never be restored. But was it
not worth his while to take the risk of being
deceived again, for the sake of possessing
such a deceiver?  As he stood drinking in
her dark loveliness, inhaling the perfume of
her very presence, a new light came into his
eyes. He began to draw her towards him.
But she shrank back, and her face crimsoned
deeply under his gaze.

"Arthur!"  she said  'rafter the words
you have spoken, if you hold my hand an
instant longer, it will be an insult ! Arthur,
you are cruel  you make me feel myself degraded

! Let me go  have mercy, and let
me go !"

Lynn stood for a moment, still holding her
hand. There was a struggle plainly written
on his face ; his lips moved, but no words
came. Then lingeringly, very lingeringly, he
released the hand he had been holding tight in
his. At last  "Yes, go!"  he said  "There
is yet time !"

She broke from him, and passed swiftly
through the crowd. Lynn stood looking after
her. She had not gone far before he saw a
gentleman hasten up to her  a flushed, excited
gentleman, whose loose top-coat was flung
back so that his evening-dress was shown 
Mr. Arden. Lynn saw Mr. Arden catch his
daughter's arm, and hurry her away through
the crowd. He stood looking after them till
they were lost to view. Then Yaughan tapped
him on the shoulder. " Time's all but up, my
dear fellow," he said ; " I've secured a place
for you, and seen to your luggage. You have
not a moment to spare." Lynn followed him
mechanically towards the train.

'have you come to take me home?"  said
Camilla to her father. "You don't need to
seize hold of me like that  I am quite ready
to go now."

"Are you not afraid to speak to me?" 
panted Mr. Arden, almost inarticulate, between
haste and fury. " Home ? You don't deserve
one ! Come away out of this at once ! 
Where's a cab ?  You unnatural, ungrateful,
shameless girl ! Do you know what you have
done?"

Yes. I have said what I came here to say."

And the young man didn't say what you
wanted him to say ! He didn't ask you to
take a trip abroad with him ?"

You forget  he is a gentleman."

At any rate, I know now he isn't a fool.
I can't say the same of you. What view do
you suppose Dulcimer will take of this nice
escapade of yours?"

I don't care much about Mr. Dulcimer's
views."

The man you are going to marry ?  at
least, if he'll take you now, which I must say

is not likely. I for one could not hold him
to his bargain, after this !"

"You will not need. I am not going to
marry Mr. Dulcimer."

So this is another of your cursed caprices ?
But you've kicked over the traces once too
often, I can tell you. I shan't have you any
longer on my hands, disgracing me before my
friends ! I know the proper person to look
after you  not a born fool like your Aunt
Elizabeth. You'll go off to a very different
sort of house  and you'll go with a character ! "

'' You can't let me go too soon."

Your Aunt Katherine's the proper person
to have charge of you. Yes, you shall go to
Langford  it's the dullest hole in all England,
by God !  You won't find any young men
there to jilt one day and run after the next.
She']\. look well after you. There's no male
creature ever enters her door !"

I tell you again, you can't send me too
soon."

You shall go tomorrow, my dear. But
you'll very soon change that tune. Before a

week's over, you'll be crying your eyes out to
get back again  and, mark my words, you
shan't get !  Come, get into tke cab. I won't
have you make an exhibition of me any longer,
i've still got a reputation to keep up, you
know!"

Lynn took his seat as the train was on the
point of starting. Vaughan made no allusion
to the curious scene of which he had chanced
to be the witness.

Write me from Vienna," he said ; " and
remember, we look for rattling letters  short
sentences with a fact in each  and we'll ' lead
out ' the first half-column ! There's something
to live for !  Good-bye, my dear fellow. Have
a good time, if you can  and, remember, our
expectations are high !"

Before he reached Dover Lynn told himself
that he had that night won a victory over which
he might congratulate himself, dear as it had
cost him. He could not, in his present state of
feeling, foresee a day when he would be able
to think of Camilla Arden with indifference.

More than that, he could not believe that he
would ever know real happiness without her.
But he saw that, had they not parted as they
had done, a worse thing than either had known
as yet might have befallen both of them. A
love such as Lynn's had been for Camilla 
when no longer consecrated by such perfect
trust, such reverence for the ideal as his had
been  is as a flower that becomes poisonous
when it has lost its perfume.

CHAPTEK XXVII.

FURTHER VIEWS OF MR. MALLORY.

During his second visit to the Continent,
Lynn worked hard at the letters he had promised
to write for the Forum. Indeed, he
was surprised by his own industry, when he
remembered how differently he had passed
his time in Germany a year ago. Then, his
head had been full of song and legend and
clair de lime. Now, his thoughts ran on such
matters as wages, hours of labour, rent, taxes,
and strikes.

His new studies were, perhaps, as hard as
ever he had found exact science. But then,
he could neglect them without jeopardising his
future. He might be as idle as he could endure,
and the voice of the homilist would never
be uplifted. No one could constrain him to

visit a manufactory rather than a picture
gallery ; or to go to a workman's club in preference
to the opera. So he cheerfully went
through tasks which would have seemed irksome
to the last degree in the days when work
had been imperative.

He received from Mr. Mallory more than
one letter, congratulating him on his communications
to the Forum. "The writing,"
said Mr. Mallory, " is very good indeed. You
have the journalist's love of facts, and the
artist's selective faculty Your letters on
The War of Tendencies and Bureaucracy
against Democracy have a more than passing
interest. Those you have entitled The Tax
of Blood and Disbarrack ! are, in their way,
admirable ; indeed, I have made them, as you
will see, the basis of a leading article. Your
letters should be expanded and issued in a
volume, which would, no doubt, be highly
prized by all earnest political thinkers."

The day when such words would have
thrilled Lynn with joy had passed. For him,
wealth had depreciated the currency of compliment.

No doubt the outward signs of love
and friendship  hand-clasps and tender glances
and soft whispers, kind words of praise and
brave words of comfort  must have a higher
value to the man with a hundred a year than
to the man with a hundred thousand. The
latter cannot feel so sure of his market when
he seeks to buy the things that are to be bought
only without money and price. Now Lynn
was eccentric enough to have this feeling, and
to be troubled by it. He was in no way
elated by Mr. Mallory's words of praise ; he
took them for what they were worth ; but, at
the same time, they gave him a certain satisfaction.
There was, then, a kind of work
which he could do ; in which, with time, he
might even come to excel. The thought was
comforting to Lynn, in his present state of
mind. " The problem before me," he said to
himself, "is this  Can I gain for myself a
position in which I shall be regarded as something
more than Hume's legatee ? Am I to
rise superior to my wealth, or is it to drag me
down? Because I am rich in pocket, must I

be poor in heart and soul ?  sceptical of admiration,
of sympathy, of love  of all save
what the hands can touch and the eyes see ?

Lynn very soon had proof, if such were
needed, that from his relatives at least no
obsequious overtures would come. There was
a letter of his with which he felt more than
usually satisfied, when he re-read it in the
columns of the Forum. As it was mainly
descriptive, Lynn thought he would send the
paper in which it appeared to his cousin Gertrude.
Gertrude had always sympathised
with him in his dreams of literary success.
She was, indeed, the only one of all his friends
who had ever done so.  Camilla had at no
time shown any such interest or sympathy.
Lynn remembered that now ; and there
passed through his mind one of those comparisons
which are swift, almost, as an intuition.
"Yes," he said to himself, " that bit about
the Judengasse does not read badly. And my
uncle is much interested in the Jews. And I
think Gertrude would like it. Yes, I'll send
her the paper."

VOL. III. M

Lynn awaited an answer from this cousin
with more eagerness than he might have cared
to admit. But no answer came. " Gertrude is
offended' thought Lynn. " Her pride is hurt.
She will not write to me because of what
passed at that miserable ball." And Lynn
owned to himself that the manner of his leave-taking
on that occasion had been such as
might have given any ordinary girl some
cause of offence. But Gertrude !  he had
thought that she understood him  that she
had felt with him in that overmastering sense
of irritation which had driven him forth from
Mr. Macritchie's house. It was not like Gertrude
to take offence ; it was still less like her
to be unforgiving. Lynn's thoughts came
back to this point somewhat frequently, during
the days that passed without bringing any
answer from his cousin.

At last a letter came  a letter from Mr.
Inglebyby, so curt and frigid as to be almost a
message of renunciation. Mr. Inglebyby stated
that he had felt it to be his Duty to consign
the Forum which Lynn had sent, unread, to

the flames. He forbade his nephew to send
another copy of that journal to his, Mr. Inglebyby's,
house. In conclusion, he expressed a
wish that, so long as Lynn did the work of
the man Mallory, all correspondence between
himself and his relatives should cease.

This letter at once pleased Lynn, and
pained him. It pleased him inasmuch as it
explained the reason of Gertrude's silence ; and
also because it so fully exonerated his uncle
of any disposition to truckle to his, Lynn's,
wealth. It pained him because it seemed to
cut him adrift so completely from his only
kinsfolk. At the same time, he had no intention
of sacrificing his own ambition to his
uncle's prejudice. What had Mr. Inglebyby to
osier him, in exchange for all he must give up
in breaking with Mr. Mallory ?

When his uncle's letter came to him, Lynn
had been abroad for nearly three months. A
like interval passed before he again found
himself in London, and during that time he
had heard no tidings of his relatives in Shaw-kirk.


One of the first things which he did on
returning to town was to call at the office of
the Forum. In the sub-editor's room he found
his former colleagues, Vaughan and Sugden,
who gave him welcome. The aspect of the
place seemed pleasantly familiar to Lynn  now
that he was no longer compelled to breathe
that gaseous atmosphere, or toil through those
heaps of ' whimsies ' which littered the table as
of yore. Vaughan and Sugden, too, were
unchanged in their manner towards him ; they
greeted him as one of the brotherhood, and
nothing more. As he stood talking with them,
however, he fancied that a change had, somehow,
come over the spirit of the scene. The
Forum office seemed pervaded by a feeling of
repose to which he had been quite unaccustomed
during his nights of suffering there.
The hoist remained quiescent in its wooden
pillar. The reporters came and went with a
dignified slowness. The night-foreman still
demanded ' copy,' but without threatening or
reproach. From the room on one side of
Sugden' s came a sound as of men laughing

together ; and from that on the other side was
heard one who whistled an operatic air.
Everything seemed to betoken a relaxation of
the rigid discipline of other days. Mr. Sudden
seemed unusually disposed to neglect his
copy ' for conversation ; and Mr. Vaughan
had a lighted cigar between his lips. Now in
Lynn's day to have smoked in that room at
that hour would have been well-nigh as insensate
a deed as to have smoked in a powder-mill
or a cathedral.

Is this the Forum office ?" said Lynn ; "oris
the Editor away on a very long holiday ?
The porter told me that he was in his room."

He told you truly," said Yaughan. " The
Chief  I should rather say the Captain  is at
present engaged in an important duty. He is
scuttling the ship. That, as you are aware, is
always an operation of extreme delicacy. On
this occasion, however, we believe it will be
performed to the satisfaction of all  even, I
may say, of the under writers."

"Do you mean by that that Mallory is
giving ups the Forum f "

Ay, ay, sir ! We are, I tell you, scuttling
the old craft, before we hoist the Jolly Eager
on a new one."

"Have you not heard, Lynn?" said Sudden.
" There's to be a new paper."

It is to attack everything and everybody,"
continued Vaughan. "We  the Chief, Sudden,
and myself  are to transfer to it our
invaluable services. The British Constitution,
I believe, is to come down ; but my salary is to
go up."

Lynn had already sent in his card to Mr.
Mallory ; and at this point was summoned to
the Editor's room.

He was received by Mr. Mallory in a
manner suggestive of deep but restrained
satisfaction. The lowered tone and significant
inflection of Mr. Mallory' s voice, the
grave gladness of his countenance, the firm
clasp of his hand  all indicated an appreciation
of Lynn's services, a gratification at his
return, as at a long-looked for event which
brought a positive relief to the editorial mind
too profound to be expressed, but which

such an one as Lynn could, of course, be
trusted to infer.

Then Mr. Mallory made a little speech. He
hoped that Lynn would at once act upon his
suggestion regarding those singularly able
letters. They should certainly be re-published
in book-form. He had no hesitation in saying
that the author of those letters would yet
become a Literary Force which would have to
be reckoned with. To which remarks Lynn
replied that he was quite satisfied with the
publicity already given to his articles, and had
no wish to seek to extend it ; whereon Mr.
Mallory shook his head, raised his eyebrows,
and shifted the conversation.

After a brief interchange of opinions  that
is, of phrases  on Continental politics, Lynn
rose to take his leave. But Mr. Mallory
detained him.

'' Stay a moment, Mr. Lynn," he said. "I
should like to have some private conversation
with you  not here, where I am constantly
being intruded on, and have my hands filled
with work. I should like to have a talk

Avitli you on certain affairs of, I venture
to think, more than personal importance 
a talk at leisure. Could you breakfast with
me at my chambers, on Saturday, at eleven
o'clock?"

Lynn accepted the invitation ; and made a
note of Mr. Mallory's address.

"I shall be delighted to see you, delighted
indeed," said Mr. Mallory. "Must
you go now ? Ah, well, I shall not seek
to detain you  the fact is, at this juncture
I have scarcely a moment I can call
my own. This paper is engrossing my attention
at present. Good-bye, my dear sir,
good-bye."

Left scuttling," thought Lynn, as he
returned to Mr. Sugden's room. There he
learned a good deal more from Yaughan and
Sugden regarding Mr. Mallory's new departure.
Mr. Mallory had of late, as Yaughan
phrased it, " been going in for the Free Lance
lay." The Government had not done what he
had said they would do. They had proved
him a false prophet, and so made it his duty

to prove them false legislators. Accordingly,
the Fonnn appeared daily with a fresh attack
on one or another member of the Cabinet.
An exuberantly moral oration of the Prime
Minister's was described by Mr. Mallory as
the Carmagnole of Cant. A certain Secretary
of State was alluded to as a Boabdil-Pecksniff ;
while one of this statesman's colleagues was
reminded that the Whig element in a Liberal
Administration is merely the lead ballast
which enables the ship to carry more canvas
and sail closer to the wind. All this was
trying to the proprietors of the Forum, one
of whom was Lord Primavere, the young
noble still in his Radical stage, beloved of the
men of Shawkirk. Now Lord Primavere had
a deeper admiration of the Prime Minister
than of any living creature, with the exception
of the flying Belle Poule. And the
Whig who had been rebuked for declining
to see himself in the light of ballast was a
particular friend of Lord Primavere's. And
Lord Primavere himself had of late dreamt
dreams of a prospective Under-Secretaryship.

And his connection with the Forum was an
open secret ; a fact which greatly increased
his alarm and indignation at the new attitude
taken up by the paper. To all protests,
however, the Editor turned a deaf ear ; and
when the proprietors exchanged the tone of
remonstrance for one of command, Mr. Mallory
at once resigned his office. He could not,
however, be immediately got rid of ; and as he
scouted the idea of writing against his convictions
until the expiry of his term of power,
Lord Primavere's life was for some weeks
made well-nigh a burden unto him. Each
morning he opened the Forum with a shudder,
and read it with a groan. That it should
appear daily with fresh gibes at the great
Leader  that its utterances should be quoted
with approving, but sardonic, comments in
the Tory journals  was hard to bear. But
that was not the worst. A day was drawing
nigh whereon Lord Primavere was to open a
Liberal Club, and expound politics to a provincial
audience. And as Mr. Mallory would
not be severed from the Forum before that

day came, there seemed every likelihood of his
Lordship's speech being subjected to satire in
the columns of his Lordship's paper. How
often had Lord Primavere rejoiced in Mr.
Mallory's command of irony, when the
common enemy had been under the lash !
Now he trembled, as he bethought him of its
sting.

As for Mr. Mallory, he was in no way
annoyed at the rupture brought about by
what he called his Independence. For sometime
back he had clearly seen that something
of the kind must happen. He had spoken of
it months ago to Mr. Arden and certain other
of his friends as a 'contingency;' and had
taken all his measures to meet it. He could
do perfectly well without the Forum ; but he
did not think that the Forum could continue
to exist without him. During the last fortnight
of his reign he relaxed somewhat the
stringency of his discipline in the office ; but
he himself worked as hard as ever to the end.
When Mr. Vaughan described his Chief as
occupied in 'scuttling the ship,' he, perhaps,

did Mr. Mallory less than justice. The
articles which then adorned the Forum were,
it is true, audaciously inconsistent with its
previous utterances. But then Mr. Mallory
never wrote a thing because he believed it.
He believed it because he had written it.
That any product of his ]Den could do aught
but good, was an idea he was incapable of
grasping. It was possible that his articles
might compromise the Forum. It was impossible
that they could fail to advance the cause
of Progress and Truth.

"You observe that sole, Mr. Lynn?" said
Mr. Mallory to his guest, as breakfast on the
appointed Saturday was drawing to a close.
Because the former proprietor of that sole is
at present one of the proprietors of the
Forum, You may have heard his name 
Mr. Billing."

I have  seen the name," said Lynn ;
but I did not know until now that its owner
had any connection with the paper."

"There were reasons  ah  why it should
not be obtruded on public attention. The

man is a fishmonger  a Philistine  ah 
naturally, a worshipper of Dagon. The other
proprietors, as you may be aware, are
Lord Primavere, poor fellow, and Mr. Ho-season,
the bill-broker. You wonder why I
should trouble you with these details, Mr.
Lynn?"

I don't doubt you have a good reason for
doing so," said Lynn.

'I have," said Mr. Mallory. "These details
have an important bearing on the matter I
wish to discuss with you.  Well, to return to
our  ah  proprietors. My relations with this
curiously assorted trio, I may say to you,
have been until lately of a satisfactory nature.
However, some few weeks ago they did me
the honour of calling upon me together. And
what do you suppose was the object of this
visit ? It was to expostulate  yes, actually
to expostulate with me in regard to the
attitude taken up by the Forum towards the
Government !"

Lynn expressed due surprise at this heinous
conduct, and Mr. Mallory resumed : 

The interview, I believe, was a painful one
for some of those present. I had, you see, to
point out to this grotesque triumvirate the
impossibility of satisfying the wishes of each
of its members. ' You, Lord Primavere,' I observed,
' desire that the paper should contain
verbatim reports of each and all of your
speeches, along with articles  ah  explanatory
of their merits. You, Mr. Billing, wish the
paper to retain a large circulation. Clearly,
then, your object is incompatible with your
partners. Then again, Mr. Billing,' I said,
you wish the Forum to support the Government
in all things ; whereas Mr. Season
wishes to render it a great advertising medium,
with no more political influence than Holloway's
pills. Do I interpret your views correctly,
Mr. Season?'  I said to him. Mr.
Season said with a kind of enthusiasm that
I interpreted his views perfectly; and Mr.
Billing became impassioned, raising his voice
and dropping his H's as if they had been his
old friends. The result of the interview has
been  but possibly you may have heard of

that already, Mr. Lynn, since your return to
town?"

I have heard," said Lynn, " that you are
about to give up the editorship."

You have been correctly informed. In a
few days I shall cease to edit the Forum. I
do not regret it. Indeed, I have all along
been troubled by doubts as to the propriety of
any connection with a member of the Hereditary
Chamber. But enough of the past ;
what I wish to talk of with you, Mr. Lynn, is
the future. I intend shortly to assume the
editorship of a new paper. It will be named
the London, and will be absolutely unfettered
by the bonds of party. Now, Mr. Lynn, it
has occurred to me that the founding of this
new paper may exercise a weighty influence
upon your career."

In what way, Mr. Mallory ?"

In this way. The proprietors of the ncAV
organ will be myself and a few of my friends
men who trust me too well, and, I may
say, know me too well for any ]Possibility of
discord to arise. Among those friends, Mr.

Lynn, I should be gratified to include yourself.
I have, I may tell you, perfect confidence
in the future of the London

"I have no doubt your confidence will be
justified," said Lynn.

"Nor have I," said Mr. Mallory ; "none
whatever. Nor have those friends of mine, of
whom I spoke to you. They have thrown
their money into this undertaking, expecting
a return  a large return ; and they will not
be disappointed. But that, Mr. Lynn, is not
the inducement I would hold out to you."

That would be no inducement to me," said
Lynn.

I know it," said Mr. Mallory. " I do not
talk to you as I would to the Billings or
Seasons. You have wealth, but you have
also brains."

Lynn had to restrain an inclination to smile.
Mr. Mallory, he knew, would as soon have
thought of complimenting a mere sub-editor
on his ' brains ' as he would of asking him to
breakfast.

I intend to be very frank with you," the

Editor went on ; "I shall show you my whole
hand. My desire is to associate you with
what I believe will be one of the great Forces
of the Future. If I were to say that I was
prompted in that desire by pure friendship,
by a single-eyed interest in your success, you
might, perhaps, suspect me of insincerity ?"

I might, perhaps," said Lynn.

And therefore," said Mr. Mallory, 'I do
not say it. No, Mr. Lynn. When a man
has devoted his life, as I have done, to the
Cause of the People, he learns to repress his
natural feelings in the case of individuals who
may awaken his interest. So I tell you
frankly that I make this suggestion to you
for the sake of the Cause I have at heart.
I recognise in you one who might be an
adherent of the first importance."

Lynn shook his head. " I fear you are
mistaken in me," he said. " I really can't discover
what my own views are. You have something
in your leading article this morning
about 'flaccid solids' and * viscous fluids'  "

VOL. Ill, N

"The phrase is not mine," said Mr. Mallory
; " still, it is good."

It describes with something like accuracy
the state of my political opinions. I used to
be a fiery Eadical, but I have lost that fine
frenzy now. And I'm afraid I differ from you,
Mr. Mallory, with regard to the treatment of
individuals. I don't believe any longer in
doing good en bloc. If I can help a man here,
and another man there, it will content me.
I have my father's fate to warn me against
philanthropic projects."

Such projects are foredoomed to failure,"
said Mr. Mallory. ''If you try to stop the
driving-wheel of Industrialism by your own
unaided strength, you will, of course, be pulverised.
You must act on the engineer. In
other words, we must act by the Press and
the Platform  and especially by the Press 
on our legislators. And we, who have given
ourselves to the service of Humanity, must
see to this  that our sympathy is not dissipated.
We must not allow our energy and
ardour to be frittered away in isolated deeds

of charity  in petty inventions to this or
that individual. It is painful to resist the
temptation  that I know well. But the impulse
must be crushed, if we would really
benefit the mass of our fellows."

I don't know that I have given myself
to the service of Humanity," said Lynn. " I
should like, of course, to do what little I
could to make people happier, if I knew how.
But I don't pretend to understand this idea
of Humanity as a thing to be worshipped. I
must say I find most men rather selfish,
thoroughly commonplace, and not a little
tiresome  as I have no doubt most men find
me."

"A man may be a democrat without being
a demophile," said Mr. Mallory drily. " That,
however, is beside the point. Your wish, Mr.
Lynn, I assume to be this  to discover a line
of work congenial to your tastes, and adapted
to your new position ?"

That is my wish, most certainly."

"Naturally. All men  that is, all men
who are not mere appendages to an eyeglass 

really care nothing for what is called ' pleasure.'
What they really care for is Work  and
Power. Now, Mr. Lynn, when you came to
town you looked forward, I doubt not, to
finding a joy in fighting your way upward ?"

I did," said Lynn. " I knew a happiness
then which I have not known since. I feel,
since this money came to me, as if the ground
were cut away beneath my feet. I feel myself
a poorer man, by so many thousand pounds.
It is as if Fortune had given with her right
hand, and taken away with her left  and
more than she gave. You have read me
correctly, Mr. Mallory."

I judged you from myself," said the
Editor. " You feel as if an accident had
deprived you of your aim in life. It is not
so, as I shall show you. Suppose, now, that
you were to connect yourself with the London,
and to devote yourself to political writing in
its columns, and elsewhere. In a few years,
you would become known as an independent
thinker and a powerful controversialist. You
would form the acquaintance of men whom it

is an honour to know. And you would have
the consciousness that you were engaged in
the highest work to which a man can devote
himself."

"Party polemics, Mr. Mallory?"

"No  the vindication of the oppressed
classes. For my part, Mr. Lynn, I do not
take a high view of literature divorced from
politics and sociology. Indeed, I believe that
even the work of the poet will come to be
recognised as of distinctly lower value than
the work of the publicist."

"I can't go with you so far as that," said
Lynn. "I rather hold, with Sir Philip Sidney,
that 'the poet is the monarch of all
sciences.'  By poetry, of course, I don't mean
the fruits of that 'culture' which has cut
itself off from both deep thought and practical
life."

We have seen, both of us," said Mr. Mallory,
" a melancholy instance of the 'culture'
you speak of, in that unhappy dweller in the
sty of Epicurus  Dulcimer, I think his name
was ?  Yes, Dulcimer. Let me make the laws

of a people, Mr. Lynn, and he shall certainly
not make its songs !  By the way, your friend
Arden "

He is not a friend of mine."

No ?  Your  ah  former friend Arden
has lost the poet for a son-in-law, have you
heard?"

I have heard so," said Lynn.

'' The young lady has returned to town,"
went on Mr. Mallory, with a quick look at
Lynn's face, which the latter met unmoved.

Indeed," he said.

"Yes. I met her the other day at her
father s house. She is as  ah  ornamental as
ever. She seems by no means inconsolable

for the loss of  ah  Mr. Dulcimer But

to come back to the subject of your own
career, Mr. Lynn. A few years hence, you
may enter Parliament."

That is not in the least likely. It is an
ambition I have never set before me."

"Perhaps not. Because you cannot as yet
have awakened to all the possibilities, and
responsibilities, of your new position. And,

conceivably, you may never care to woo a
constituency. There are, no doubt, even at
present, a few men outside the House  men
whom I may term Creative Publicists  who
have refused to tie themselves to the wheels
of Party, and whose decisions on the vital
questions of the day carry quite as great
weight as if they came from recognised Parliamentary
leaders. Now, I could quite understand,
Mr. Lynn, that if you were one
day to occupy  as you very well may  a
position of that kind, you might be reluctant
to hazard your influence by taking part in the
Parliamentary hurly-burly. ' '

"You speak from experience, Mr. Mallory ?"
In part I do. I have felt, I will own
it to you, that I could not afford at present
to accept a seat in the House. Were I todo
so, it might compromise me in the eyes
of the People.  But your path may differ
from mine, though we are conscious of the
same motive, and keep the same goal in
view. And if you ever did choose to enter
the House, you would find it, I need scarcely

say, an inestimable advantage to be connected
with such an organ as the London will doubtless
become. Of course, while I am as I now
am, it would matter less. But at any moment
the man who has given his life to the People,
in the way I have done, may succumb to the
heat and burden of the day. And whatever
might befall me, the paper would, of course,
endure."

Mr. Mallory paused, as if expecting an
answer. But for some time Lynn did not
speak ; he seemed immersed in thought.

*'I see all the advantages of your offer,"
he said; "but you must not wonder if I
hesitate. It is not as if you asked me merely
to invest a certain sum of money at a certain
rate of interest  "

Certainly not," said Mr. Mallory ; " I ask
of you much more than that. To those other
friends of mine of whom I spoke, I showed
certain rows of figures; and they, on the
strength of those figures, and of my reputation
in the world of letters, have thrown their
capital into the new enterprise. I myself

shall throw into it my money and my brains.
I invite you to join in it on a precisely similar
footing. I desire that you may become my
partner, and my  ah  coadjutor."

"That is why I hesitate," said Lynn, 'ras
would not, if it were merely a question
of money. The issue is, to me, all-important.
My decision may very probably give
its shape to my whole after-life.  Tell me,
Mr. Mallory, do you think there is not an
alternative between living in absolute idleness,
and entering actively into politics ?"

In your case  none. You could not, of
course, even if you tried, enjoy what is called
pleasure' now-a-days by young men. On the
other hand, my dear sir, you are too eager,
too ardent  ah  you have too much red blood
in your veins, ever to be mummified into the
inutility known as a scholar."

"Surely that is heresy from you, Mr.
Mallory !"

"How  heresy?"

I thought you were a firm believer in
Mill, you know?"

I regard Mill as the light-bringer par
excellence of this generation. I believe that
Avignon will be lastingly associated in the
minds of men with the Logic of Mill  not
with the strumming of Petrarch. Eeally, I
don't see the drift of your remark, Mr. Lynn."

Was it not Mill who preached the Gospel
of Leisure ? And do you not think it possible
for a man to turn his life to some
account by devoting it to quiet study, without
rushing into the ' hurly-burly ' of practical
politics, as you yourself called it a moment
ago?"

"Not in the case of such a man as you.
If you attempted it, you would speedily make
the acquaintance of the Demon of Ennui which
haunts great libraries. You must have excitement
; that is obvious. Mr. Lynn, would you
make of your intellect a rusty rake to disturb
the dust-heaps of the Past, when you might
use it as a shining sword in the battle-fields of
the Present?"

I am not vain enough to think that I
have any such weapon at command."

"My dear sir," said Mr. Mallory, with a
smile more flatteringly significant than words,
I know you better than you know yourself.
What a career  what a future lies before a
man with independent means and the dialectic
gift, who, with youth on his side, devotes
himself to the Cause of the People ! His
efforts after self-culture are freed from the
taint of egoism. He knows that as his mind
ripens, as his style takes a keener edge, he
is making himself a more finely-tempered
instrument for the redressing of Wrong.
Even if the Fates should not 'heap up his
moments with fame,' they will 'triple his
pulses with life.'  And yet there are writers
who, forsooth, would have us believe that
it is a finer thing to flutter a girl's heart,
than to thrill a mighty concourse of men !
When I think of these imbecilities, I see
more and more clearly the deep wisdom of
Plato in excluding poets from his Republic."

Would not that prohibition have shut out
Plato himself?"

"It might. But I sympathise with him.

nevertheless. There is nothing, Mr. Lynn,
nothing in the gamut of human folly, that
saddens me so profoundly as the reading of
what are termed 'love-poems!"

"I should not have thought you would
have taken such things so seriously, Mr.
Mallory."

"I do take them seriously, and I will
tell you why. But first of all, I hope you
will not suspect me of cynicism  a thing
which, above all others, I despise."

Cynicism is better than hypocrisy, is it
not?"

It almost invariably is hypocrisy. I
despise a cynic as I do a dogmatist. Your
dogmatist is a man who says the same thing
over and over again, because he has nothing
to say in support of it. Your cynic is a
man  in nine cases out of ten  who says
he loves no one, because someone will not
permit him to say that he loves he7\ Now,
on what subject have more 'cynical' things
been said than on any other ?"

On love and marriage, I should suppose."

'that is so. And, of course, when you
hear any individual airing such flippancies
as  ah  let us say, for example, this  'If
love is the wine of life, marriage is the headache
in the morning'  you know exactly
what to expect. You know that on the
earliest opportunity that individual will act
as if the chief end of man were to prove
himself only a little lower than the ringdoves.
 You were surprised that I should
take such things as those 'love-poems' seriously,
Mr. Lynn?"

I should like to know your reason," said
Lynn.

"You shall have it," said Mr. Mallory.
Now, is it not the case that just as young
men, when they have attained the age of
unwisdom, think themselves poets and accordingly
make themselves ridiculous  so, at
the same stage, they believe the time has
come for them to ' fall in love '  delude themselves
into the notion that they have really
done so  and think that they have thereby
achieved something very fine indeed ? That

is what happens ; and in the case of average
men it need do no great harm. But the sad
the infinitely deplorable thing which we
owe to poets and story-tellers is this. They
have be-rhymed and be-lectured many into
the belief that this thing called 'love' is
the one thing worth living for below 'the
visiting moon'  that it is an exalting, intoxicating
and imperishable joy, which all
may know. To the average man this, of
course, does no harm. But the men of the
finest fibre, the men who are born to be the
champions and benefactors of their fellows
from their glowing sensitiveness  their ever-vibrating
sympathy with all victims of Wrong
these men are thereby led to seek an outlet
for their emotions in a direction which is
almost infallibly ruinous.  I do not, remember,
deny that there may have been and may bea
few  a very few  individuals who have
known this 'love' of which we read. But
the thing is so rare, so exceptional, that to
know it is little short of a miracle. And
yet  thanks to poets and novelists and such

people  men are taught to believe that this
divine joy is to be gained by whomsoever
will keep his eyes open and his heart un-chilled
! The select few of whom I spoke,
they also go in search of it  with the result
that, after a course of idealising folly, they
are jilted, or married ; becoming, of course,
in either case disillusioned and soured. Thus,
we lose the very men whose passionate force
would otherwise spend itself in promoting
the emancipation of Humanity. It is a terrible
price to pay for mellifluous mendacities !"

"Again you go beyond me, Mr. Mallory,"
said Lynn, as the Editor paused. "Your
atmosphere is too rare for me to breathe it
freely. Some time I may reach your heights
but, at present, I am still only ascending."

You are yet young," said Mr. Mallory with
a smile. " But one day I think you will come
to see with me  and I can wish you no better
wish than that. You must not suppose that
I in any way contemn sentiment ; on the contrary,
I revere it. But the question is, in
what channel shall your sentiment flow forth ?

in the runlet or the river ? You must make
your choice."

Between the vivre pour autrui and the
egoism a deux f "

'' Unquestionably. I say to you, Mr. Lynn,
that the men most richly dowered with noble
emotion, if they give up to an individual what
was meant for mankind, are certain  almost
certain  to end in misery. A single vase cannot
hold the water of a flowing fountain  that
is all. In the case of a man such as you or
myself, marriage would be a dereliction of
duty. For one thing, marriage almost inevitably
deadens a man's interest in the things of
the spirit  in the great movements of the
day. If the marriage is a happy one, he sinks
into square-toed domesticity and tea-pot humdrum.
And, of course, in the case of a man
whose intellect is daily developing through
study, marriage can scarcely ever be happy.
You choose, say at twenty-two or twenty-five,
the companion who suits you at that stage.
Ten years afterwards your tastes have altered,
they have matured ; but your consort is

unchanged, save by corpulence. At one time
a human being likes candy ; at another, claret.
The man who marries in his youth will be
forced to content himself with molasses  not
to say vinegar  when his educated palate
craves for Lafitte."

Mr. Mallory paused, and glanced across the
table at his guest. Lynn said nothing. He
appeared, however, to be listening with close
attention ; and the Editor resumed : 

And there is another thing which you, in
your present position, ought to consider. For
the married man, the pleasure of Society
is robbed of its most delicate aroma. So
long as you remain single, you will inhale a
subtle fragrance of romance in every .
Every beautiful girl will be of
interest to you, as you will be to her. In
that you will find relaxation  innocent but
piquant  from your serious labour. But once
you are married  the air will be no longer
stirred for you by the wings of invisible
amoris. No  you will have lost the choicest

bouquet of social intercourse. You will
VOL. ni. o

stagnate, vegetate  what you will ; anything,
but live."

Then," said Lynn, " you do not counsel
me against poetry, after all, if only it stop
short of matrimony ?"

' It is a fair retort," said Mr. Mallory with
a smile. ' Nevertheless, you must see clearly
what I mean  and, as regards yourself, I trust
your views may harmonise with my own.
And now, Mr. Lynn, let us descend from sentiment
to business  our conversation has
wandered somewhat from the matters I intended
to discuss with you."

Mr. Mallory' s business talk lasted some time.
It was devoted entirely to the subject of the
London; and led up to a distinct, tangible
offer made to Lynn of certain terms, on which
he might become one of the proprietors, while
joining the staff, of the new paper. It was too
important a matter, the Editor said, to be
settled off-hand. At the same time, his
arrangements must be speedily completed ;
and he could not, in justice to others, leave
the question open for a lengthened period.

He must request Lynn to bear that in mind,
and to give him his final answer at the earliest
possible moment.

By the way," he said, as Lynn rose to go,
I proposed you for the Wayfarers', Mr.
Lynn, as I promised to do before you left for
the Continent. And at the ballot the other
day you were duly admitted. You will find
it an excellent club in every way, and you will
meet a number of men there whom it is desirable
that you should know. I hope to have
the pleasure of introducing you to some of

them. C and S and D " (here

Mr. Mallory named certain celebrities in the
literary and political worlds) " are members of
the Wayfarers."

Lynn thanked Mr. Mallory for his good
offices ; and took his leave, after making an
appointment to dine with the Editor at the
club on an early day.

This interview gave Lynn sufficient food for
thought. He had enjoyed Mr. Mallory's conversation
greatly, but it had been with a
purely intellectual enjoyment. Nothing could

have been more complimentary than Mr.
Mallory's way of playing the Mentor  his 
manner  his assumption
that they two, kindred spirits, stood
alone upon a height above the mass of men.
But Lynn's eyes had been opened. He saw
through the flattery, to which, in his former
days of happy tremulousness, he might have
fallen a victim. Mr. Mallory had sought to
play upon his vanity. It had been a singularly
clever performance ; but it had failed.

The proposal with regard to the new paper,
however, was a matter quite distinct from all
that talk about Humanity, love, marriage, the
conduct of life, and such things. It was a
definite offer, which he might either accept or
refuse.

Lynn had no doubt as to the financial success
of the new paper. And he himself had
abundance, super-abundance of money. There
seemed every prospect of his being clear of
the Lone Peak in a very short time, without
the loss of a shilling. And according to
advices from Mr. Malcolm, his partner in

Queensland, the property there had risen, from
accidental causes, to nearly double its former
value within the last six months. It was not
therefore for any reason connected with money
that he hesitated as to saying Yes to Mr.
Mallory.

But he recognised the fact that if he joined
himself with the Editor of the London, he
would have to break definitely with his own
past. There was no reason why he should give
his money to this new venture, unless he gave
himself with it. Making all allowance for Mr.
Mallory's desire to be agreeable, Lynn was
quite aware that his power as a writer had its
value in the Editor's estimation  a value much
less considerable, indeed, than his money, but
still worth taking into account. He did
think, without vanity, that he could make
himself felt in the working of the London.
And Mr. Mallory had certainly touched the
chord of ambition within him. What he
might yet aim at was uncertain ; but, undeniably,
to have an influential journal at one's
back is a Teat things.

o o

Nevertheless, Lynn did hesitate. And the
reason of his hesitation, as he found on analysing
his own feelings, was simply the fact
that if he cast in his lot with Mr. Mallory, his
estrangement from his kinsfolk at Shawkirk
would thenceforth be final. He knew his
uncle too well to think otherwise ; what Mr.
Inglebyby had said, he would certainly do. But
was this a sufficient reason for throwing away
such a chance as that now offered him ?  the
very chance that he had desired to find  that
of striking out a line for himself, in which his
wealth would play only a secondary part ?
Reflecting on the matter, Lynn did not think
that it was a sufficient reason. Nevertheless,
he hesitated still. His thoughts ran a good
deal, in those days, on Mr. Mallory's philosophy
of life. There had been truth in the
Editor's words, no doubt. His love for
Camilla Arden  that, indeed, might have been
such a passion as Mr. Mallory had described 
an idealising of folly  a thing that would not
have been helpful to him in his life, but the
reverse. Even granting that, however, he did

not feel at all disposed to station himself on a
height with Mr. Mallory, and thence look
down on love as an illusion that promises
everything, and has nothing to give. He
knew better than that. He knew that if 
and his thoughts went back to Shawkirk ; and
still he put off the day of his decision.

On the evening appointed, he dined at the
Wayfarers' with Mr. Mallory. Two or three
celebrities were of the party ; and the London
was not so much as mentioned.

In the club smoking-room, after dinner, a
gentleman came forward aid accosted Mr.
Mallory. Lynn heard this gentleman, who
spoke in a voice by no means subdued, ask to
be introduced to him. He fancied that a
shade of annoyance crossed the Editor's brow,
as if he did not quite like having to go through
this ceremony. The gentleman was, however,
presented to Lynn by Mr. Mallory  as Mr,
Bonnamy Fowler, M.P.

CHAPTER XXYIIL

THE PRODIGAL.

In all the speculations regarding his relatives
in which Lynn had indulged since his departure
from Shawkirk, he had pictured them
to himself as living on in the dull routine
which he knew so well  continuing to do
and say just the same things he had left
them doing and saying. He did not as yet
know of a certain great Event, which had
broken the monotony of the family existence.

This was nothing less than Caroline's engagement.
Mr. Carstairs had prospered in
his wooing ; had obtained Mr. Inglebyby's approval
; and pushed on matters with such
ardour, that now the wedding-day was fixed.

The prospect of a marriage worked an
immediate change in the domestic economy

of the Inglebybybys. Mr. Inglebyby's womankind
promptly took the upper hand, and shook
off the discipline which he had imposed
upon them. They never consulted him ;
only asked him for cheques. They made
the house such that he wandered through
it like a Eip Van Winkle awakened. The
funereal parlour was littered with snippets
of cloth and ends of thread, with articles
of feminine attire, and gauds and gewgaws
such as Mr. Inglebyby had never beheld before.
There was a ceaseless influx of parcels in brown
paper, which were opened amid ejaculations
of delight. Mrs. Inglebyby and her daughters
appeared to be constantly engaged in the
purchase of hostilities or superfluities ; in
anxious deliberation over the veriest trifles.
The matching of colours, the adjustment of
tags and bows, the regulating of shillings and
fringes, seemed to fill up their minds to the
exclusion of all serious thought.

All this made Mr. Inglebyby feel ill at ease.
He could not regard it as a fitting preparation
for holy wedlock. And yet, he could

not assert himself; for once, in his own
household, he felt himself tacitly ignored.
The marriage itself he was prepared to view
with satisfaction, tempered by regret at the
loss of the bright little girl, who had fluttered
round him like a butterfly round a boulder
of granite. But he wished to imbue his
family with a sense of the responsibilities
of marriage  and they seemed to care for
naught but the philosophy of clothes.

Mrs. Inglebyby spent her days between
millinery and tears. Gertrude was sincerely
glad ; showing not a sign of irritation at a
position of affairs which has been known
to sour the sweetest sisterly affection. Caroline
strove vainly to assume the grave dignity
befitting a bride of twenty. Never before
had she so fully realised the depth and
complexity of the Dress Problem ; and the
working out of this, together with the visits
of her betrothed, almost filled up the measure
of her happiness. Almost  for even in those
halcyon days, Caroline had her vexations.

One of these was the conduct of Dick,

which had latterly undergone an inexplicable
change. He had become taciturn and
morose. For the first time in his life, he
seemed to find no anodyne in the wine-cup.
He appeared quite to have altered his habits.
He never went out of nights now, but spent
the evenings with the family in the parlour,
where he sat silent, moody, and unsympathetic.
When Caroline expressed her opinion
of this unnatural gloom  which she did
frequently and with acid frankness  Dick
never retorted in his customary vein. He
contented himself with dropping dark hints
to the effect that "they might all laugh
in the meantime ; they little knew what was
in store for them "  that " sometimes things
didn't come off as people expected"  and
sundry muttering of the like ominous kind.

"It is too bad of Dick," said Caroline.
"The idea of him going about like a  like
an undertaker just before his sister's marriage!
The last time Edward was here, I declare he
was barely civil to him. I think, mamma, it
really is too bad !

The poor boy is ill," said Mrs. Inglebyby.
"He has been working beyond his strength,
and needs a holiday. Of course I know, my
dear, that we should all be happy at your
marrying  and marrying so well, too !  I'm
sure I cried half last night to think of your
leaving us  but nobody, you know, can help
feeling ill. You must have noticed how pale
Dick is ! He has lost his appetite. He is
just pining away."

And that Dick had lost his complexion and
his appetite was a fact patent to all. Gertrude
had some idea of what those symptoms might
mean. She questioned him on the subject,
but without avail. Dick stated that he
wished he were dead ; but beyond that would
impart to her no definite information.

Caroline's other anxiety was more grievous
to her than even Dick's unbrotherly behaviour.
She had set her heart on having Lynn present
at her marriage. It was not only that she
had a genuine affection for her cousin ; she
felt that if he were not there the ceremony
would be shorn of half of its splendour. And

such had been the words and looks of Mr.
Inglebyby, on the rare occasions when Lynn's
name had been mentioned in that household
of late, that Caroline feared there was
scant likelihood of his receiving an invitation.


I think it's a shame, mamma," she said.
I won't feel like being ]properly married, if
Arthur isn't there. The things papa says
are perfectly horrid. Why, what harm has
Arthur done?"

"I'm sure I don't know, my dear," said
Mrs. Inglebyby ; "I never did understand what
it was all about, nor why Arthur went away
from us in such a hurry. But you had better
speak to your father yourself. Perhaps he
will listen to you, now."

Caroline accordingly did speak, when they
were within about a fortnight of the all-important
day, and still Mr. Inglebyby had
made no sign.

"Oh, papa," she said, as the family were
gathered at the supper - table, "don't you
think it is time we let Arthur know what

is going to happen ? He may have arrangements
to make before he can get away from
London."

Caroline had decided on this as her best
opening move  to assume her cousin's coming
as a matter of course. That failing, the air of
pensive resignation might be tried.

"I do not intend to write to your cousin,"
answered Mr. Inglebyby, '' regarding your approaching
union with Mr. Carstairs. Nor do
I suppose that such intelligence would interest
him, in the sphere which he has chosen for his
own."

"Oh, how can you say that?" cried Mrs.
Inglebyby  " when Arthur has always taken
the greatest interest in the girls ! And I'm
sure that he will be more than pleased to have
Mr. Carstairs for a  for a cousin-inlaw. I
suppose that would be the relationship ?  And
you know he said that Mr.  well, Edward, I
mean, but it seems all so strange yet !  that
Edward was a  what was it. Carry ?  Oh, yes !
A ' capital fellow'  that was it."

Your cousin, Caroline," said Mr. Inglebyby,

*' has, of his own free will, severed himself
from those who should have been dearest to
him, to join himself with men who earn their
daily bread by sapping the foundations of
religion and morality."

Father !" protested Gertrude  '' is not
that a little too strong ?"

It is not," said Mr. Inglebyby. " I do not
speak without warrant. I have been reading
the book of the man Mallory  the book which
is called Martyred Humanity. Its contents
have filled me with horror. They exceed anything
I could have believed possible, even in
these days of pernicious doctrine and rampant
heresy."

Oh, papa, have you really read it ?" cried
Caroline. '' What is it like ? I do so wish
you would let me see it !"

I shall certainly do nothing of the kind,"
said Mr. Inglebyby ; " it is not a volume, so far
as I understand these things, to be placed in
the hands of Youth."  Mr. Inglebyby, indeed,
had the ' volume' locked carefully away in his
desk.  " When you ask me, Caroline, to invite

your cousin to your marriage, I cannot
forget that lie is at this moment allied with a
man to whom Marriage itself is  not a solemn
ordinance, an awful obligation girt round with
sacred sanctions  but a mere social contract, a
civil institution. I cannot forget that your
cousin, at this moment, may possibly be speaking
or writing, as a scoffer, against Christian
Wedlock."

Mrs. Ingieby and Caroline would fain have
pled further ; but the lurid picture called up
before them by these words reduced them to
inarticulate sorrow. But help) came from an
unexpected quarter.

What !" cried Dick, rousing himself from
his now habitual silence, and speaking in a
tone of genuine alarm  " not have Arthur at
his cousin's marriage ? Oh, you can't mean
it ! You must ask him  you inst, I say !
Why, you'll make people think he has quarrelled
with us ! It would be a downright
shame, not to ask him  a shame and a sin !
That's what it would be."

Sir !" exclaimed Mr. Ingieby in high wrath

but before he could go further, Caroline had
interposed.

Well, I must say, though I done think
Dick has been behaving of late to me  and to
Edward  as a brother should  still, I must
say I think he has spoken both nicely and
sensibly just now."

Caroline !" cried Mr. Inglebyby ; but Caroline
was not to be repressed.

** I suppose, papa, that a girl who is about to
make a marriage which is approved of by her
family should have some say as to the people
who are to be asked to the ceremony. It will
be unkind of you, papa  it won't be like you
one bit  if you don't let me have Arthur
down !"  Then, passing suddenly from the reproachful
to the appealing  " Oh, papa, think
of this ! This will be the last thing I shall
ask you to do for me before I go away !
Surely you won't refuse me, when I am going
away so soon, and you won't have your little
girl to tease you any more ! Don't be unkind
now, papa ! Do ask Arthur to come !"

The tears came into Caroline's eyes as she

VOL. III. p

Spoke, and Mrs. Inglebyby wept aloud. Gertrude
watched in manifest anxiety her father's
face ; and Dick continued to utter ejaculations
of excited protest.

Caroline," said Mr. Inglebyby at last  and
his face was paler than its wont, and his voiceless
firm  " Caroline, my little girl  my dear
little girl  I would do much to make you
happy, even at a sacrifice to myself, now when
you are leaving me, and all of us  forsaking
father and mother, to take up the duties of a
new estate. You know that, Caroline ?"
Yes, papa," sobbed Caroline.
I trust, my dear, that you have chosen
wisely  as I oti I think you have  and I
have prayed nightly that the new life on
which you are about to enter may be one
of happiness. But this thing I cannot do.
If it were a question of seeming to humble
myself in your cousin's eyes  if it were
that alone  I would do even as you wish.
But I cannot take into my house and home
one who has deliberately set himself to do the
work of those who are doing the work of the

Adversary. It would lie heavy on my soul
were I to have one who has leagued himself
with the Infidel associating with my daughters
and  and with my son."

Here Dick gave vent to an audible groan.

Do not misunderstand me," continued Mr.
Inglebyby. " I have still a hope that if I abide
by my decision, and hold no converse with
Arthur Lynn, he may yet turn away from
the false teachers  those wells without water,
those wandering stars, for whom is reserved
the blackness of darkness for ever. Even yet,
I say, his heart may yearn for his kindred 
for that he has a kind heart I know."

He has," interjected Dick ; " there's no
doubt about that !"

But until that comes to pass, there can be
no welcome for him here. He has chosen his
path, and it shall not cross with yours. So
honos as he continues where and what he is,
he shall be  I say it with sorrow, aye, bitter
sorrow, but none the less am I resolved  he
shall be to me and mine as a heathen man and
a publican !"

This finale put an end to protests and
supplications. The evening had been robbed
of its cheerfulness for all. But amid the
general depression, no observer could have
failed to note the despairing, the agonised woe
betrayed by the countenance of Dick. His
manner in taking leave of his mother and
sisters for the night was something more than
peculiar.

Good-night," he said in sepulchral tones ;
good-night, all of you. Don't say I haven't
done my best. Whatever happens, don't say
I'm to blame. Good-night, Carry ; I'm sure
I hope you'll be happy  but you'll all be
sorry Arthur wasn't asked ; you will, mark
my words. Good-night again, mother  goodnight,
Gerty. Yes, the governor-ell be sorry
yet for what he's done to-night. You'll
see.

'poor dear boy!" said Mrs. Inglebyby.
How fond he is of his cousin ! Well, well
I suppose your father must be right. But
it is such a disappointment !"

Next morning, the mysterious significance

of Dick's good-night was explained. He did
not come down to prayers ; and, on search
being made, it was discovered that he had
not passed the night under his father s roof.
Further inquiries elicited the fact that he had
been seen in the refreshment-room of the
railway station, equipped for travelling. All
was uncertain, save the fact that Dick had
fled the town ; and dire was the consternation
which reigned in the Inglebyby household.

On the evening of the day after Dick's
flight from Shawkirk, Arthur Lynn spent
some time at the Wayfarers' Club, of which
he was now a habitue. Club-life was new
to him, and he entered into it with some
zest. What a contrast it was to the old
life at Shawkirk ! How far away it all
seemed from Mr. Inglebyby's dingy parlour,
where the shadow of impending homily
seemed ever to brood ! At that hour Mr.
Inglebyby would be summoning his household
to prayer. How irksome the nights in Shaw-kirk
had been !  and yet, had he found them
so in the time before his first journey to

the Continent ? Lynn confessed to himself
that he had not. He knew what had given
life, even Shawkirk life, its charm in those
days ; he knew what had robbed it of that
charm since. Again the feeling of dissatisfaction
with his present  the vague sense of
incompleteness and insufficiency  came over
him. It made him feel uncomfortable. Why
could he not let himself go with the current,
and take the world lightly, like other
men?

As he stood musing, a loud voice broke
upon his reverie  the voice of Mr. Bonnamy
Fowler, M.P.

"Seen Mallory to-day, Mr. Lynn?" boomed
the financier. " No ? Thought I might find
him here  Wednesday night, you know 
no sitting to-night. Mallory's friend The
O'Mourdoch talked out the bill. Bad lot,
The O'Mourdoch  ever met him? I say" 
and here Mr. Fowler's voice sank to muffled
thunder  " I am glad to hear we are going in
together. Very glad indeed. I have no fear
myself  none whatever."

"'We?'" said Lynn. "Who are 'we Mr.
Fowler?"

Why, you and Arden and myself, to begin
with. Hope it will turn out as well as your
last operation, Mr. Lynn. Splendid coup that,
and no mistake ! You and Arden worked
it well between you. Met him lately ?"

No," said Lynn ; " indeed, not since the
coup''

"This will be different from opening in a
lively stock, of course," continued Mr. Fowler.
But it's a sure thing, I take it. No ' unloading'
needed in this, eh ?"

In the London ?  that is what you mean,
I suppose ?"

Of course it is."

I did not know until now that Mr. Arden
had any concern in the new paper."

No ? Thought you would. (Suspect I've
spoken too soon," reflected Mr. Fowler ; and
he determined to say no more to Lynn on the
floating of the London.) " I did hear something
about his being in the syndicate, but
you must know as much about the whole

tiling at this stage as I do  very likely more.
Want me to take a hand, some men here
do. See you again to-night, perhaps."

One moment, Mr. Fowler  you seem to
be under a false impression about me. I amas
yet, in no way bound with regard to this
new paper of Mr. Mallory's. He has talked
the matter over with me, but that is all.
And as to the coup you spoke of, Mr. Arden
deserves all the credit of that. I should be
most unwilling to rob him of it."

"Most proper, I'm sure"  murmured Mr.
Fowler.

"Unfortunately, I could not explain the
matter without exposing an ignorance of 
well, of business, that would seem to you
incredible. But I may inform you that I am
no longer a partner in the Lone Peak company.
My brokers had instructions to sell
out whenever the stock touched par. And
they did so yesterday."

Mr. Fowler betook him to his rubber in the
belief that he had somehow 'put his foot in
it.' His opinion of Lynn was gone ; but Mr.

Arden stood even higher in his estimation
than before.

Lynn walked back to his rooms in Jermyn
Street, vexed and ill at ease. He was annoyed
at the thought of the Lone Peak transaction
being represented as it plainly had been to
Mr. Fowler, and, no doubt, to others. He
was angry with Mr. Mallory for having concealed
from him, thus far, the fact of Mr.
Arden's pecuniary connection with the new
paper. He could not look on this as a chance
omission. He had no doubt that Mr. Fowler s
first statement was true.

Till now, Lynn had been halting between
two opinions with regard to Mr. Mallory' s
proposal. The temptations to agree to it
were strong ; the advantages it offered were
obvious. To reject these, for the reasons that
had hitherto swayed his mind, would be like
casting away the substance for the shadow.
Still, he had felt a certain disinclination to
bind himself to Mr. Mallory; and had from
day to day postponed taking the step from
which he could not go back. He felt glad

now that he had done so. The discovery he
had made through Mr. Fowler decided him.
It furnished him with a reason, quite satisfactory
to himself, for having nothing to do
with Mr. Mallory's project. He had long
ago made up his mind that at no price
should he again become involved in any way
with Mr. Arden. He would certainly stand
by that resolve.

Another, and not less disagreeable, surprise
was in store for him, when he entered his
sitting-room. There, at the table, sat Dick
Inglebyby, with white face and blood-shot eyes
looking the wreck of his former self. His
checked Tweed suit, his massive double watch-chain,
his crimson neck-tie and far-flashing
breast-pin, gave, as it were, an ironic setting
to his misery. He looked the picture of grief,
but of grief in a hoiiffon masquerade. The
first thought that flashed through Lynn's
mind, as he gazed at his relative, was that he
had witnessed the same scene in a farce.
Dick's look and attitude were such that he
might have stood for a low comedian's study

of woe. But this impression passed in a
moment ; and a great fear seized upon Lynn
of what his cousin's coming might forebode.

Good God !" he cried ; " what's the matter
with you ? What brings you here ?  there's
nothing wrong with Gertrude ?  with any of
them at Shawkirk?"

'' Everything's wrong at Shawkirk," moaned
Dick ; and he sank his head and made a helpless
movement with his hands  " at least,
everything will be, soon. It's all up, Arthur.
Oh, this is awful !  awful !"

What is awful ?  Is anyone ill, or  what
is wrong ? Can't you speak, man ? Why
have you come here ?"

Nobody's ill at Shawkirk. It's worse than
that, by a long chalk. I'll tell you all about
it  I came here just for that  but give a
fellow some time to  to recover himself 
You see, Arthur, there's to be a marriage in
our family."

A marriage !" said Lynn, and he stood for
some time silent. He was conscious of a sinking
of the heart ; a sensation almost of giddiness.

which made him see Dick for the moment as
it were through a mist. '' So," he thought,
'that is over. Morton has carried his point."
And in that instant Lynn knew that he loved
his cousin Gertrude.

'who is to be married?" he asked, almost
mechanically.

Caroline, of course," said Dick. " She's
to be married to Carstairs, the lawyer.  At
least, she was to have been, but all that's at
an end now, of course."

Caroline 1" said Lynn; and in the gladness
the news brought him his irritation at
Dick's behaviour was very sensibly lessened.
"Now then, Dick," he went on, "you say
something dreadful has happened, about you
and about your sister's marriage  and that it
is to be and is not to be. Just come to the
point, will you, and try to tell your story like
a rational human being ?"

I wanted them to ask you to the marriage,
Arthur  I tried to make them, I did indeed.
But the governor wouldn't, for all I could say.
It wasn't my fault, anyhow."

'' I don't want to hear about that. You've
got something to say, Dick, and you're afraid,
or ashamed, to say it. You really don't need
to beat about the bush with me."

It was all Lord Primavere did it, Arthur !
It was all through him !"

What in Heaven's name do you mean?"
asked Lynn ; and he began to think that
his cousin's brain must be giving way.

You see there's what they call ' forestalling,'
you know. Well, Primavere was always
dead against that, and he was ' forestalled'
about Belle Poule, and couldn't get his price
because the public money was on, and so, you
see"

Oh, cut all that. You mean, in short,
that you've been at your old work  gambling
on the turf. That's what you've come to tell
me, I suppose?"

I wasn't gambling," said Dick piteously ;
*' I haven't touched cards for I don't know how
long  I haven't, I'll swear it ! I was only
following Primavere's horses  got the straight
tip  but I lost a bit of money, you know.

Not what a fellow like you would call much"
and Dick glanced round the luxuriously-furnished
room  " but a good bit for a fellow
like me."

*' What did you mean by talking about your
sister's marriage? What have your betting
losses to do with that ?"

Fm coming to that  only give a fellow
time. But I want you to understand, Arthur,
how I got into this mess. You see, it's this
way ; when an owner is ' forestalled'  "

Have you been borrowing from Carstairs ?"

Not I," said Dick, with a touch of his old
manner ; " not likely. He's a different sort
from you, Arthur. He can't sympathise with
a fellow."

No, I should think not. Now, look here,
Dick. If you drop that ridiculous slang, and
let me hear exactly how you are placed, I shall
listen to you. If not, you can't take yourself
off too soon. Understand that."

*' Well, this is how it was. I lost a lot of
money over Belle Poule to a blackguard Niven
-  and  "

"Well?"

Well  it's not nice, you see, for a man to
marry a girl whose brother can't pay his debts
of honour. You can hardly expect him, you
know."

Oh, that's it ? You think I did not mean
what I said to you at Shawkirk, when I took
up that bill of yours ? You are trying to
impose on me again, under cover of your
sister's marriage ?"

No, no, Arthur  it's not that  it is not, I
swear. I'm not lying this  I mean, I'm not
lying to you now. There's nobody to help
me if you won't ; and if you don't, it will be
all through the town  and, of course. Carstairs
won't have Carry then."

'' What will be all through the town ? Understand
this, Dick  if you don't make an end
of all this shuffling and groaning, and speak
out like a man, I shall not listen to you any
longer. I'm sick of your wretched stories.
I've heard them all before."

It's not about betting this time, Arthur.
If that were all !  but it's worse, far worse !

It will kill my mother if it comes out. Oh,
it's awful  awful ! I wish I were dead !"

Once more, will you make a clean breast
of it, or will you not ? What have you been
doing ? And what do you want of me ?"

Want ?" repeated Dick. " This is what I
want, Arthur. I want to get away !"

To get away ?  where ?"

Anywhere," said Dick. " I don't mind, so
long as it's far enough. Manitoba  New
Zealand  the Cape  it's all one. Perhaps the
Cape would be best  it's furthest, isn't it ? 
and I knew a fellow that was sent there by his
governor. If you'll only pay my passage out,
Arthur, and give me a trifle to start with, it's
all I'll ask. And you'll never see me anymore,
you know."

That is absurd, Dick. Tell me the whole
truth  if you can  or else stop talking altogether."


'* I will  yes, I'll tell you the truth  the
whole truth !" said Dick, with a flaccid attempt
at a manly bearing. " I will, so help
me ! And then, perhaps, you'll give me the

money to get clear away. As I told you, I
owed money to that scoundrel Niven  "

'who is he?"

'' Niven ?  He's a  a publican at Shawkirk.
It wasn't much to begin with, but it ran up at
last to about 200. At least, he said it did.
But, of course, he has swindled me ; I know
that."

How did you come to owe this man
money ? Betting, I suppose ?"

'' He put it on for me, with the bookmakers,
you know. At least, so he said. And I
always lost, and put on some more to clear
myself. But it was no good  everything
went against me. Oh, Arthur, if you knew
what a life that man has led me ! I didn't
want to win anything  only to clear myself 
that's the truth ! He dunned me morning,
noon, and night. He'd come up to the "Works,
and hang about till he saw me. Once he came
to the office. At last he said he'd go to the
governor, and demand payment from him.
He put the screw on me most awful. Oh,
you've no idea of it  none !"

VOL. Ill, Q

And what did you do ?  for I see you've
done something."

He said if I'd give him a hundred and
twenty, down, he'd give me back all my
I. 0. U.'s. What was I to do ? He'd got my
last quarter's allowance already, and wouldn't
wait for the next one  besides, that wouldn't
come to thirty pounds. He wouldn't hear of a
bill  what he wanted was a cheque for the
amount, or else the cash  one or other. Of
course I had no cash, and so  and so  I 
I got him the cheque."

From your father ?"

Well, no. Not exactly. You see, Arthur,
it was this way. Niven said he wouldn't
present the cheque  only keep it, as a kind
of guarantee the money would be paid. If
I gave him the cheque, he'd give me time to
pay up ; that was the bargain. I believed
him. I thought it was all done on the square,
you know. I did it just to gain time."

"Did what? Signed the cheque yourself?"


"Well, no. Not that, exactly. I haven't

got a bank account, you know. I didn't put
my own name to it  "

Then you forged your father's name ?"

Oh, Arthur, don't call it that for God's
sake, don't ! It wasn't forgery  not common
forgery, I mean. The cheque was never to be
presented  you know I told you that, Arthur !"

Oh, you fool 1" said Lynn ; '' you fool ! 
and worse than fool !"

Here Dick began to cry bitterly, and Lynn
perceived the uselessness of such upbraiding.

Finish your story," he said, after a pause.
"Goon."

After he got the cheque," continued Dick,
still in tears, "the ruffian was worse to me
than ever. He swore he wasn't going to lie
out of his money any longer. He would go to
the bank next day, unless I paid him up what
I owed in full  in full, mind you  and a
hundred pounds into the bargain !"

For hush-money ?"

"Of course he knew I didn't want it to
come out. It would bring disgrace on us all,
you know."

And where did he think you were to get
the money?"

From my father, or  or from  from  "

"From me?"

Well, everybody in Shawkirk knows how
rich you are, Arthur. You can't wonder at
that, can you?  That was why I wanted
them to ask you to the marriage. I couldn't
write to you about it, but I thought that if
I saw you, and  and explained the thing, you
would  "

"Did this man Niven know that you had
forged your father's name ?"

Oh, he was too precious 'cute for that 
he shammed not to, you know. He asked
me once before another man how I got the
cheque, and of course I had to say I got it
from my father  I said it was in payment
of my screw  my salary, I mean. And the
impudent rascal said that a cheque with old
Inglebyby's name on it was as good as a banknote,
any day. He knew how it was, all the
time, just as well as I did. But you could never
bring it home to him. He's too deep for that."

"Is that everything?" asked Lynn. "Are
you keeping nothing back ?"

"Nothing!" said Dick; "no, I've made a
clean breast of it, I have!"  And he seemed
actually to feel a glow of returning self-respect,
as if dimly conscious that his wrongdoing
had been in some way expiated by
confession.  " I've told you all, Arthur.
Nobody can say I've tried to hide my
mistakes."

"And now, what do you want me to do ?"

"To pay my passage out, Arthur! Only
that  to pay my passage out ! Do that, and
I'll turn over a new leaf, see if I don't ! I'll
make a fresh start. Yes, I'll rough it like a
man  I'll go to the backwoods  anywhere.
I'm not afraid"  and Dick actually felt himself
growing heroic as he spoke.

"And so," said Lynn, "if I were to 'pay
your passage out'  whatever you mean by
that  you would leave your family to face
all the shame and misery you have brought
upon them ? You would have this man goto
your father, and tell him what you have

done ? Upon my word, Dick, nothing you
have told me to-night makes me think so
little of you as that does !"

"But what am I to do?" moaned Dick,
again prostrated. " It's a case of going to
prison, unless I get clear away in time. My
father will never pay for me, I know that, and
I shall be sent to jail ! Much good it will
do my people to have me sent to jail ! It
would kill them, and it would kill me. I
couldn't stand it  you know I couldn't !"

And at this point Dick became incoherent
and hysterical.

"Have your people any notion of where
you are ?" asked Lynn.

Not unless they guess. I didn't tell them
where I was going. In fact, I didn't tell
them I was going at all."

Lynn sat for some time silent and in
thought, furtively observed meanwhile by
Dick. At last he spoke.

I'm not going to lecture you," he said,
on what you have done. But T tell you
frankly that your conduct has been so selfish

and so shameful, I would not lift a finger to
help you, if the punishment of it was to fall
only on you. You are a forger, and the place
for a forger is a prison."

Oh, Arthur, don't be so rough on a fellow !
Don't call me that  for God's sake, don't !"

"This is what I mean to do. I shall
telegraph to-night to your father that you
are here."

Dick shuddered.

And tomorrow I shall take you with me
down to Shawkirk."

What ? Go back to Shawkirk ? Never !
I couldn't look my father in the face  I
couldn't do it ! I would rather kill myself,
than go back ! Yes, I would !"

"Do you think I am going to help you
to skulk away like a coward from the consequences
of your crime ? I say you shall
go back to your father, and confess what you
have done, or, at least, authorise me to do that
for you."

"Never!" cried Dick; "never! Oh, why
are you so hard ? Oh, I wish I were dead !"

That's what you must do, Dick. It's your
only chance. Your father has been kept in
ignorance about you far too long  there must
be an end of that now. I can see that there's
no hope for you, so long as you're allowed to
escape the penalties of your own folly and
wickedness. You will simply end as a tout
or a billiard-marker, if not a jail-bird, if you
are let off now."

Again Dick wept copiously. "I'd much
rather go away," he said  '' anywhere, out of
the country. Oh, won't you pay my passage
out? It's the last thing you'll ever have todo
for me !"

I shall do nothing of the kind. After
you have gone down with me to Shawkirk,
and done all you can to get your father's
forgiveness, I may be able to assist you, but
not tiU then. That's final, Dick."

He'll never forgive me. He'll say terrible
things, I know he will !"

I should think he will, but, all the same,
you'll have to go. Otherwise, I simply wash
my hands of you and your affairs."

But will you see that blackguard Niven ?
Will you buy the scoundrel off?"

"Yes."

"And will you tell the governor about it,
and soften him down all you can ? "

Yes, if you have not the manliness to doit
yourself. Now, Dick, is that settled ? Or
are you going to take yourself off?"

"I can't do that," whined Dick; "where
am I to go to ? I haven't got a shilling in
the world !  All right, Arthur !"  with a
fresh assumption of the heroic  " I'll do it !
You may wire to-night, and I'll go down with
you tomorrow. There's my hand on it !"

Lynn took his cousin's hand, not without a
qualm ; and so the matter was arranged.

CHAPTER XXIX.

MEDIATION.

Mr. Inglebyby's first proceeding, after learning
of his son's flight, was to go up to his office,
and make a careful scrutiny of the books and
cash which had been under Dick's charge.
He found no trace of any defalcation, and
this was a relief to him, so far. Then he
took his cashier, a shrewd and trustworthy
man, into his confidence ; and commissioned
him to make private inquiry after the fugitive
in the town. But no clue to Dick's
movements was found ; nothing beyond the
fact that he had certainly left Shawkirk.
The cashier, however, in making this report
to his employer, conveyed to him a much
clearer notion than he had had before of his
son's mode of life, and the kind of company

he had been keeping. Mr. Inglebyby's feeling
in regard to Dick became one of indignation,
rather than of alarm. He began to think it
not unlikely that Dick had gone off on some
mission in the cause of Vice. He would not,
at all events yet awhile, raise the hue and
cry after the runaway. He would wait, and
see what the day might bring forth. Mr.
Inglebyby accordingly waited ; but the day
brought forth nothing.

This was by far the saddest time the 
had ever known. The house had become
a house of mourning. All that Gertrude could
devise to assuage her mother's almost frantic
grief she had done, but with little avail. In
the intervals of her paroxysms of weeping and
wailing, Mrs. Inglebyby gave herself up to
visions of the ghastly-grotesque, which were
worse than the paroxysms themselves. She
beheld Dick's corpse under every imaginable
circumstance of horror. Now he had been
cut to pieces by an express train ; now done
to death, in a wood, by gypsies ; now he lay,
stark and stiff, at the bottom of a coal-pit ;

and now, drowned in the Fala, was being
drifted inanimate to the sea. To this last
idea Mrs. Inglebyby recurred most persistently.
The Fala was then in flood ; and she vehemently
besought her husband to go forth on
the instant, and have the river dragged. Mr.
Inglebyby did not stir ; and this proof of callous
indifference to the lost one's fate drove Mrs.
Inglebyby into hysterics. Caroline meanwhile
was wrapt up in the sense of her personal
wrongs. That such a thing should happen
within a fortnight of one's wedding-day 
that one's happiness, when so near, should
be imperilled by one's own brother  for that
Dick had done something dreadful she was
sure  was hard, very hard to bear. It was
all very well for Gertrude to be composed
and collected ; Gertrude was not in her, Caroline's,
position, and could not know what her
feelings were. Mr. Inglebyby, for his part, made
no lamentation. He took up his cross  not,
indeed, meekly, but with a grim patience,
a kind of half-stoical resignation. Only when
Caroline exclaimed against her cruel, cruel

lot, did Mr. Inglebyby give utterance to words
of grave and almost stern admonition. If,
he said, it should be found that Eichard had
fled on account of some dishonourable act 
and he did not conceal from them that there
was reason for the supposition  then it should
be his Duty to lay a statement of the case
before Mr. Carstairs. Whatever the consequences,
that must certainly be done; and
it was as well that Caroline should know
it now. Whereon Caroline departed in tears,
and shut herself up in her own room.

When Lynn's telegram arrived next morning,
it relieved Mrs. Inglebyby's mind, but hers
alone, of all anxiety. Such confidence had
she in her nephew, that the mere fact of Dick's
having gone to him seemed to prove conclusively
that nothing could be wrong. ' To think
of our being in such anxiety," she said in her
joy, " and my poor boy with Arthur all the
time ! To think that they will both be here
this very night ! Come, girls, let us go and
make everything ready for them ! Oh, I
thought I should have died when I saw the

telegram, but now !  It's so like Arthur ! How
good he always has been to me ! What a load
he has taken from my mind I"

Lynn's message had merely stated that Dick
had been with him in London, and that together
they would reach Shawkirk that night.
This did not reassure either Mr. Inglebyby or his
daughters. They were quite aware that some
motive more powerful than cousinly affection
must have prompted Dick to visit the metropolis.
They dreaded to think what that
might be.

When your cousin arrives, Gertrude," said
Mr. Inglebyby to his elder daughter, '' let him
be shown up to my room. I shall await his
coming there. He must see and speak with
me, before meeting any of you."

"Won't that seem very cold to Arthur,
father?" said Gertrude.

Let it be as I say," rejoined Mr. Inglebyby ;
and so it was. When Lynn reached the
house, somewhat late that evening, he missed
the joyous greeting to which he had been
accustomed  and to which, perhaps, he had

looked forward. He was taken to the small
room upstairs, used by Mr. Inglebyby when he
desired his own companionship, or had brought
home ' work' with him from the office. There
Lynn found his uncle, who rose as he entered,
but spoke no word of welcome.

You are alone V he said.

Yes. But he came with me to Shawkirk.
I left him at the hotel."

Mr. Inglebyby seated himself at the table,
and signed to his nephew to take a place opposite
him.

"What has he done?" he said; and his
face wore a look of deeper care than it had
worn since the discovery of Dick's flight. " I
know that you have come as the bearer of no
good news of him."

Lynn took the forged cheque from his
pocket, and laid it before his uncle on the
table.

That is his writing," he said, pointing to
the signature. " He admits it."

Mr. Inglebyby lifted the cheque, and held it
for some moments to the light, as though he

could not read it distinctly. Then lie laid it
down, without a word or a groan ; but his
nephew knew well what must be the struggle
within. For a little he rested his head on his
hands, and Lynn believed he was praying for
strength to bear the blow. At last he raised
his face, and said in a voice hoarse but unshaken


Tell me how you came into possession of
this."

Lynn told as briefly as might be of Dick's
arrival in London, and confession of his crime.
He made no attempt to extenuate the act.
To have done so then would, he felt, have
been no better than a mocking of his uncle's
anguish.

' As soon as we came to Shawkirk," he said,
in ending his story, " and after I had seen him
safe in the hotel, I went to this scoundrel
Niven. He was at first fawning, then insolent.
However, I gained my end, and you may rest
assured that, for his own interests, he will
keep silent."

You have given this man a bribe ?" said

Mr. Inglebyby, who during the telling of Lynn's
story had not uttered a word.

I have. I know you will say that I
should not have done so. The idea of purchasing
his silence will seem to you like
bargaining with sin. But I think you will
by-and-bye see that it was the only way.
We must think of others  of your wife and
your daughters. To have defied this man
would have been to make them pay the penalty
of others' wickedness."

You have judged me rightly," answered
Mr. Inglebyby. " I should not have treated
with that man, not though the streets of this
town had rung with the shame that has fallen
on me  not though the writer of that had
been dragged from a court of justice to a
felon's cell. Hand nor finger should I have
raised  no, not as God shall judge me. And
even yet, I do not know that I should not do
well to take it back to the wretch you bought
it of, and bid him do his worst."

*' Uncle, can you bear to listen to me a
little longer ? I shall not speak more lightly

VOL. III. R

of what your son has done than you would
yourself. But we have now to consider what
is best to be done for each and all of us. One
thing is plain. For every one's sake, Dick
must leave this place without delay."

Lynn paused, but Mr. Inglebyby said nothing.
He sat with white, tightly-compressed lips
and hard eyes, gazing fixedly at his nephew.
Since he had read the forged cheque, his face
had been as a mask of stone.

For the sake of your wife and daughters,"
went on Lynn, " Dick must be sent away from
Shawkirk at once. He dared not himself face
your anger, but this is his confession I am
making to you  for him, I ask your forgiveness."


Still Mr. Inglebyby did not speak.

I have been thinking the matter over,"
Lynn resumed, *' and I have a suggestion to
make, which I hope you will agree to."

He shall never enter this house again,"
said Mr. Inglebyby ; "he shall speak with none
of its inmates. Further than that, I have
nothing to say of him. Whether he stays

here or goes, it is the same. If you choose to
speak of him, I shall listen this night  but
this night only. Now and hereafter, he is
and must be to me as one who is dead."

Do you remember," said Lynn, " the letter
you gave me in London ?  the letter which
was written to me by the man to whom I owe
all that I have ?"

'' I remember the letter," said Mr. Inglebyby.

In that letter Hume told how, when he
was a young man in this town, he fell into
temptation  and how his life would have been
ruined, but for the mercy my father showed
him. He told how from the same kindly
hand he received the aid which enabled him
to rise to wealth in a new country. That he
was not a bad man  that he was an able, and
a generous and grateful man  you and I know
well. Had my father been unforgiving  had
he even been just and nothing more than just
where should I have been to-day ? I do
not say that Hume ever sinned as your son
has  nor that your son would prosper in a
new country as Hume did. But unless he

has the chance given him, he will simply ruin
himself, body and soul. If a day were to
come when you heard of him standing as a
felon in the dock, could you free yourself from
blame if you had refused now to hold out a
helping hand to him ?"

What he has done," said Mr. Inglebyby,
cannot be undone ; neither can it be glossed
over with empty words. My forgiveness ! 
what would that be to him ? An idle speech
a warrant to him to sin again, and heap
disgrace on my grey hairs ! "

He seems really humbled. I trust  I believe
that he is penitent."

Penitent ! Do not name the word to me.
I cannot pardon him in my heart. He has
darkened what of this brief life is yet left tome.
He has clothed me with dishonour ; he
has covered my face with shame. Shall I
ever again hold up my head among men ?
Shall I ever take in public affairs the part
that I have taken ? He that knows not how
to rule in his own house, shall he presume to
rule without it ? His deeds have brought me

down to the dust, and shall I forgive him because
of his words ?

He is your son."

"He that begetteth a fool, doth it to his
sorrow. That is the truth, and you cannot
change it. With any plans you may have
formed, I cannot interfere. But do for him
what you will, he will turn against you, as he
has turned against me."

I want you to agree to this. Let him go
out at once to Queensland. I will give him a
letter to Mr. Malcolm, Hume's old partner 
he is my partner now. Malcolm is one of the
best men in the colony. He will look after
him. He will see that he is placed in a position
removed as far as may be from temptation.
I have spoken of this to him ; he is
willing, even eager, to go. And, uncle  his
mother and sisters must never know what he
has done  "

Because he has sinned," said Mr. Inglebyby,
you would have me sin also, and fill my
mouth with lies ? "

Forgive me, uncle, but your laws of life

are too strict for such a world as this is.
Even with myself, I think you may one day
see that you have been somewhat over-severe."


I have," said Mr. Inglebyby ; " and to-night
you have heaped coals of fire on my head.
I have not thanked you, Arthur, and I cannot
thank you to-night as I should. But I see
how you have thought for us all. I had
feared, I own, that wealth had rendered you
worldly and vain and cold of heart. But I
have erred  I have grievously erred. Yes,
Gertrude was right in what she ever said of
you. She was right, and I was wrong."
"What has Gertrude always said of me ?"
That you were one of those who ought to
be rich, and not poor. That the possession of
great wealth would bring out all the goodness of
your nature. And therein I misjudged you.
But even now, Arthur  when my teachings in
my own family have borne the fruit you see
when you have come hither doing all that
may be done for us  nay rather the more
because of your kindness in this the hour of

our need  would I say to you, Abjure that
man ! Live where you will and as you will,
but do not live in daily communion with that
Arch-Infidel, and those who, under him, are
doing the work of the Devil !"

"I have ceased to write for the Forum,"
said Lynn. "And I may tell you that I shall
never write again in a paper edited by Mr.
Mallory."

"Now God be thanked!" exclaimed Mr.
Inglebyby, with unaffected fervour. "What
you have said rejoices my heart, even in the
midst of this my affliction. I have been hard
to you, Arthur  I should not have spoken to
you and written to you as I did  but it was
my fear for your soul's safety that made me
hard. You will do me that justice, I know."

"The misunderstanding was all on your
side, uncle. I never wronged you in my
thoughts. I know that what you did was
done out of a true desire for my welfare."

It was," said Mr. Inglebyby.

"And now there is but one thing more.
The knowledge of this thing must be kept

from all save you and me. I shall  if you
will allow me  tell my aunt and my cousins
all they need ever know."

"May God in His goodness reward you,
Arthur, for all you have done and still would
do for me and mine ! Had you not come.
Heaven help me, I know not what evil I
might not have wrought in my anger. I
might  yes, I might have killed his poor
mother. Tell her and my daughters what
you think fitting. I shall say nothing; I
leave the matter in your hands. More than
that I cannot do.  Now, go to them. I could
not make a feigned countenance before them
to-night. There is a bitterness of the heart with
which a man's nearest may not intermeddle.
For me, I shall turn my face to the wall."

Lynn accordingly went down to the parlour,
where his aunt and cousins had been counting
the minutes till he came. He received a
welcome in which joy, wonder and anxiety
were all blended; then the questions began.
Where was Dick ?  At the Cross Keys Hotel.
Why had he not come to the house  to his

mother?  At this point Lynn felt the full
difficulty of his undertaking. He had to
spare his aunt's feelings, and yet make it clear
to her that Dick must go. The first mention of
Queensland filled Mrs. Inglebyby with anguish
and terror. Why must her darling boy go sofar
?  right to the other side of the world ?
What had he done to be thus banished from
home and country ? Lynn could not, of
course, explain to her what Dick had done ;
and had to fall back on a liberal use of rose-colour.
Only Mrs. Inglebyby's almost touching
confidence in him enabled Lynn to go through
his task. The thing must be right, because
Arthur had said it ; and though she did not
understand it, she would take it on trust.
And Lynn's word-painting of colonial life was
not without its effect ; so that through the
mist of her tears Mrs. Inglebyby began to have
glimmering visions of her son holding high
sway over tattooed myriads ; and returning to
his native land  after a few years' absence 
rich in honour and in gold. When, however,
the time of Dick's departure came to be

mentioned, the storm of Mrs. Inglebyby's grief
broke out afresh. Had it been a year  six
months hence, she might have borne it ; but
tomorrow !  it was too much to ask of her 
it was cruel ! Lynn compassionate the poor
mother profoundly ; he knew not what to say.
He looked to Gertrude ; who alone, all through
the interview, had refrained from asking him
any question, as if divining the difficulty of
his task. He saw that she understood the
look. Gently she drew her mother away.

Gertrude," he whispered to her as she was
leaving the room with Mrs. Inglebyby, " try to
make her understand that it must be. There
is nothing else for it. It must be as I have
said."

Lynn found himself left alone with Caroline,
whose wonder and grief on her brother's
account were swept quite away in the joy
with which she learned that his misdemeanour
whatever it might be  was not to stand in
the way of her marriage. To have a listener
at that moment  and that listener her cousin,
Arthur Lynn  was sufficient to complete Caroline's

happiness. After hearing an infinity of
details regarding "Edward"  his words and
ways, his talents and his virtues  Lynn was
called on to view and admire his cousin's
wedding-gifts. Caroline kept to the last what
she evidently regarded as the most precious.

"Aren't they lovely, Arthur?" she said,
uncovering a toilet service beautifully filigreed
in silver. "Where do you think that came
from?"

From India, I should say. It is beautiful.
Why, it would do for the dressing-table of the
Grand Mogul himself!"

Would it ? Well, who do you think sentit
?  Your old friend Mr. Morton, all the way
from Kurrachee. Wasn't it nice of him ?"

"It was, Carry. How did he come to
know of the Great Event ?  Through you 
or Gertrude, I suppose?"

No, not from us. We have not written
him since  I mean, not for a long time. It
must have been from his friends in Shawkirk.
I wanted to write and tell him, but I didn't
like. And, of course, Gerty couldn't."

Gertrude couldn't ?  Carry, will you tell
me this ? I had the notion, when I was last
down here, that Gertrude was being made
unhappy about something. I could think of
no reason for that, unless Morton had something
to do with it. Was I right in thinking
so, or" was I wrong ?"

"You were quite wrong, Arthur," said
Caroline ; "most certainly you were wrong."

Was I ? So much the better !  You see,
I had fancied that your father might be making
some objection  "

"Oh! You thought that !"

And I tried to make Gertrude understand,
the last time I saw her until to-night, that
she might count on me to do anything I
could"

You said that to her ?  Oh, you shouldn't
have said that ! Indeed, you shouldn't !"

So I begin to think. Tell me this. Carry
I am not asking it, believe me, for Gertrude's
sake, nor for Morton's, but for my own.
The answer is everything to me  don't you
understand ? Was there ever anything between

Gertrude and Morton ?  is there anything
now?"

Caroline lifted her head, and glanced at
him. He thought there was a half-sly, half-pleased
twinkle in her blue eyes.

I think you are very inquisitive, Arthur,"
she said.

I know I am very anxious. Carry."

I believe you are. You do look it !" 
archly. "Well, now, I'll tell you  but it is
a great secret, you know. Do you remember
that night at Sprayton, when you all went
off, without me, to see a stupid old castle?"

I shall forget many things before I forget
that night."

Yes ?  I don't know if I should tell you,
after all. I didn't find it out till ever so long
after, and then Gerty made me promise never
to breathe a word of it.  Still, I think I may
to you, Arthur. Yes, I will  " and she whispered
:  '' that night Mr. Morton proposed to
Gertrude."

And she refused him ?" "

Of course she did. You know there never

could be any affinity between them," said
Caroline with dignity. " No doubt, Mr. Morton
is very nice, and good-looking, and all that,
but then, he is not a man of intellect I know /
would never marry anyone who was not that 
and I do think you should have known Gertrude
better than to suppose she would, either."

'perhaps I should. I don't know much
about his ' intellect,' but I know that Morton is
a thoroughly good fellow  and I hope he will
get a good girl to be his wife  the very best
girl in the world, Carry, so long as it isn't
Gertrude !"

Do you ? Why, you are quite excited
about it, Arthur ! Now, remember, you must
never tell Gertrude what I have told you.
She would never forgive me !"

I shan't tell her to-night, at all events,"
said Lynn with a laugh. " Now, I am going
upstairs to bid your father good-night, before
I go."

What ! Are you not going to stay with
us, Arthur?"

*'I am going back to the hotel to-night,

and tomorrow Dick and I leave for Liverpool."


"But you will be here in time for my
marriage?"

Without fail, Carry."

Oh, Arthur, I'm so happy !" said Caroline.
I know I oughtn't to be, but I can't help it.
You must not think me selfish, Arthur  at
least, I don't mea7i to be  and I iii sorry for
Dick, and for poor Mamma ! But when I
think how the marriage might have been put
off  and how it is to go on now, and you are
to be there  I can't be so sorry as I ought !
Do you think it very wrong to feel so ?"

Of course, be happy," said Lynn, " and
if you are sorry for Dick, don't show it. Remember,
he will have a chance of making his
way in the new country such as comes to very
few young men. He has only to keep steady,
in order to succeed. Try to make your mother
see his going in that light. Speak of him
brightly and hopefully. That is the best thing
you can do for her, and for all."

Lynn went up to his uncle's room, knocked,

and entered. Mr. Ingieby was sitting as he
had left him ; but now there lay before him
on the table an open Bible.

I have told them," said Lynn. " They
know that he is going, and they do not know
why."

"How did she bear it ?" said Mr. Ingieby.

She is in great distress. And it will be
worse with her tomorrow, when he goes."

"May God pity her!" said Mr. Ingieby.
Thus are the iniquities of the children visited
upon the parents. It were better for her, aye,
better, did she mourn as Rachel mourned in
Eamah !"

"Do not say that, uncle. Do not harden
your heart against him. Believe me, that
cannot be right."

"I do not seek to do so, now," said Mr.
Ingieby ; and he laid his hand upon the open
Bible. "Already this night I have said in
my haste things that a father should not have
said, however grievously his son had erred. 
When you spoke to me of Hume, Arthur, I
was reminded how I had sought to make your

father treat him, with justice, indeed, but not
with mercy. And now, I see and acknowledge
that therein, too, I was wrong.  But all
this has shaken me, more, perhaps, than it
should. The lights by which I had been used
to walk seemed to have gone out, and left mein
darkness. It may be that I have been
over-strict in my ways. It may be that too
much of carnal pride has mingled with my
desire to keep my name untarnished among
my fellow-men. When I spoke those bitter
words about my unhappy son, I was, perchance,
thinking more than I should have
thought of the things seen and temporal.  It
is a warning to me. I have been humbled in
my own eyes. And it is well."

'' Then," said Lynn, " will you not see him
before he goes ? Will you not let him, with
his own lips, ask your pardon ?"

"No," said Mr. Inglebyby ; "no. That is
more than I can bring myself to do. Tell
him, if you should speak with him of contrition
and forgiveness, that well-doing is the
kind of repentance which has weight with me."

VOL. Ill, s

"I shall tell him SO."

'nothing could be better," continued Mr.
Ingieby, " than the plans you have formed for
his future. Most cordially and most gratefully
I accept your offer. I leave all to your
discretion. There is but one condition on
which I shall insist  that you give me an
exact statement of all monies you may expend
in connection with this matter. I am able to
refund that portion, at least, of my debt to

you."

It shall be as you wish," said Lynn.

''He must bid his mother farewell," said
Mr. Ingieby. "Let him come to the house
tomorrow. I shall not be here."

So be it," said Lynn. " We shall leave
for Liverpool tomorrow, and I shall remain
with him till the vessel sails. And now,
uncle, good-night. For Caroline's sake, if for
nothing else, I know you will strive to bear
up against this sorrow. Who knows what
good may not yet spring from it, after aU ?"

Good-night, my dear Arthur," said Mr.
Ingieby. " I cannot declare to you the gratitude

I feel. To make any return for all you
have done lies, as you know well, no longer
within my power."

You may have the chance of showing your
confidence in me sooner than you think,"
said Lynn. "It is no time to speak of such
things now  but I may yet have to ask you
for what will make the happiness of all my
life!"

Mr. Inglebyby clasped his nephew's hand.
He looked into Lynn's eyes, with a kind of
wistful look ; his lips moved, though no words
came. And, albeit they parted without
further speech, Lynn knew that his hint had
not, at all events, added to his uncle's sorrows.

CHAPTER XXX.

THE FACTORY OF THE PAST.

No, Arthur, you can't make me believe you
have not done us all a great service. While
you were away, father let me know so much,
at least  even if I had not guessed it myself
before. And since he told me, I feel I have
not been so sorry for poor Dick as I ought.
It has made me so glad to think that my
father has come to understand you, at last !"

Really, Gertrude, you need not be sad
on your brother's account. For my part, I
have some hope of Dick, now."

Have you, indeed, Arthur?"

Yes. I believe now that your father did
a wise thing in not seeing him before he left.
Dick felt that more than I should have expected.
He is bent on winning back his

father's good opinion. He is making his fresh
start with far more than the usual chances of
success. And he will be looked after  more
closely than he has ever been before. Everything
is in his favour, and I do think he will
make his way."

I hope so  how I hope so !  When you
came back last night, I wanted to tell you
how grateful I felt. But I could not say
what I wished to say, before the others."

There was nothing to be said. But I
wanted to tell you, Gertrude, how happy I felt
last night at being among you all again. It
was so different from the evening we spent
when I first came back from London. Do you
remember?"

'* Yes, I remember it very well."

How was it you were all so different then
from what you were last night ? Last night I
felt at home once more  as I had not felt for
years. But when I saw you all again that
other time, I seemed to be a stranger come
among you.  And do you know, Gertrude, I
thought you yourself were  well, cold, and

constrained to me ? I thought you had
changed. I began to fear we should never be
on our old terms with one another ao-ain. Do
you wonder that I should have thought so ?"

No  I can scarcely wonder at it."

Then, why was it ? What made you seem
so  changed ? "

I suppose it was because you had become
so rich  "

Oh ! That was the reason !"

''  And yet, I knew you would not be
changed by riches. But I could not bear to
have you think that we cared more for you,
rich, than we had done for you while you were
poor."

That was pride, Gertrude !"

I suppose it was. I know, at any rate, it
was a very foolish feeling. But I could not
help it. You see, the people here seem all
so ready to worship money  and then, mother
and Carry hould talk of your coming as if you
were a distinguished guest  and then, Arthur,
you know you were changed yourself."

I was. I had just awakened from a dream."

I did feel for you, Arthur, though I could
not tell you, as I should have liked to do."

It was the evening of the day before that
fixed for Caroline's wedding. Arthur Lynn
had returned on the previous night from
Liverpool, after seeing the last of the exiled
Dick. With Gertrude, he had made his escape,
towards evening, from the tumult of preparation
that filled Mr. Inglebyby's house. They
had walked as far as Lynnfield, and were now
standing within the space encircled by its
ruined walls.

'' When I came back to you all that time,"
Lynn continued, " I had just made a discovery.
I had just discovered that I had been making
a fool of myself. I may tell you, Gertrude 
for it is a thing you are never likely to learn
from experience  that that is not a pleasant
discovery to make. I had just found out that
the people who, as I had been pleased and proud
to think, cared for me for my own sake, had
been treating me as a simpleton, and a tool."

Oh, Arthur, surely you don't mean 

No, I don't mean your father. Of course.

I think lie was wrong in what he did  and I
shall never forget that you pled with him, ashe
told me, to do the thing that was right.
But I understand his motives, and respect
them. And now, indeed, I ought to be very
grateful to him for acting as he did."

*' I don't understand ?"

'' You may, perhaps,  afterwards. But at
the time, I did not feel grateful to him. Indeed,
I felt very miserable, and very bitter.
And then, you know, I thought how some of
my good friends would expect me to behave in
my new circumstances, and I determined todo
the reverse of what they would look for."

You could not deceive  those who really
kncAv you ! "

It is kind of you to say that. Do you
know what I thought, when I went to the
jposte restante at one town after another, and
found no letter from you ?"

No. What did you think ?"

I thought you must be angry with me,
because  because I did not claim that waltz
you promised me !"

'' Oh, how could you be so  so foolish ! 
I wonder," she went on, a little hurriedly,
'' what Caroline will think of Shawkirk,
when she comes back from Paris ? What
a contrast it will seem !  Do you remember
the arguments you had long ago with father,
about our valley here and the Valdarno  and
which was the better place to live in ?"

I remember I talked a great deal of nonsense
in those days. I know now that one
may travel without finding the road to
happiness."

I think if I had my choice I should rather
visit Italy than any other country. Don't you
wish any longer to see Florence  now that you
can go where you please ?"

On the contrary  my fondest hope is to
see it very soon."

If you do, you won't send more letters to
Mr. Mallory, will you?"

"No, certainly not. If I do go, my time
will be very differently employed.  Do you
know, Gertrude, I have been seeing a good
deal of Mr. Mallory lately? I had a most

interesting conversation with him, not long
before I came down here from London."

'what kind of man is Mr. Mallory? Is
he really as bad as father makes him out to
be?"

'' Oh, scarcely !" said Lynn with a smile,
as he thought of certain Biblical quotations.
He is amazingly clever, that is certain. He
is by far the ablest man I ever met, or ever
hope to meet. Do you know, he paid me a
very high compliment  and meant it, so far ?
He has given up the Forum, you know, and
is to start a new paper."

"Yes?"

And he wished me to go into the undertaking.
I was to give my brains, and, above
all, my money. But the leading columns were
to be opened to me  he promised that, among
other things. It was, of course, an inducement."

"And you?"

"Refused the offer  for reasons. Whether
I shall regret doing so or not, remains to
be proved. But in the meantime, I don't
regret it."

"I am glad of that, Arthur. But you
have not told me yet what kind of man
Mr. Mallory is ?"

He is a cynic, in speech and practice.
I fancy that all cynicism is affectation, more
or less. But Mr. Mallory s is the most genuine
affectation imaginable. He talked to me a
great deal about ' doing good.' He does not
believe in trying to do good to individuals
that is only a waste of emotion, and money.
His principle is to do good on the largest
possible scale to oneself, which, he says, must
infallibly result in doing good on the largest
possible scale to Humanity. What do you
think of that as a principle, Gertrude ?"

I don't admire it."

They were standing now under the entrance
of the Lynnfield Hall, from which point the
view was shut in by the gaunt brick wall
of the factory, with its rows of shattered
windows. Not a sound save that of their
own voices was heard. And now both were
silent for a time, while they looked at the
scene of ruin and decay around them.

I should not like to come here with Mr.
Mallory," said Lynn ; ''he would be much
too epigrammatic.  Indeed, I should not care
to come here with any one, Gertrude, unless
it were with you."

You used to say, Arthur, that none of
the ruined castles you had seen abroad ever
gave you so much to think about as this ruin,
here, of your own ?"

That was true. But now I never come
here without very mingled feelings. I can't
but think how high and generous my father's
aims were. I can't but remember that all I
have is, in a sense, owing to his kindness to
others. And then I feel that I should be
untrue to his memory if I did not try in
some way to carry out what was the main
purpose of his life. You understand that
feeling, I know."

Oh, yes so well !"

'' But then  when I look at the ruin his
schemes ended in  when I think of the ingratitude,
the malice, the ridicule he earned
and that, too, from the very men for whom

he sacrificed his all  I find my heart hardening.
My reason sides with Mr. Mallory. And
then, it is so difficult, so seemingly impossible,
to find the true way to work in ! Why, the
very word ' philanthropy' seems to bring irony
with it as its shadow  so that at times I feel
tempted to cease from troubling over it
all"

"You will never do that  never! When
I first heard how you had become rich,
I thought, ' now Arthur will be able to
take up his father's work ! Now he will
be able to do good, as my uncle tried todo
!'  I have thought so often about him !
I have come here so often alone when 
when you were away, and have thought how
far he was above the other people here, and
how sad the end of it was !  and I felt proud
to think that now you would be able to carry
out what he had given his life to in vain. 
I don't mean in the way he tried  I don't
understand about these things  but there
must be many other ways ! Are there not ?
And you will find one, Arthur, if you seek

for it !  or  or am I speaking foolishly ?" and
she stood silent and blushing at the excitement
into which she had been betrayed.

You are speaking as I would have a 
cousin of mine to speak," said Lynn  and he
marvelled more than ever how he could even
for a day have deemed his cousin cold. " I
don't need to tell you, Gertrude," he went on,
that I have gone through a good deal, since
this money came to me, to make me doubtful
about the things I used to believe in most
firmly. Both here and  and elsewhere, I
found out that your fortune or want of fortune
makes a wonderful difference in other
people's estimation of you. Of course, I knew
all that before, theoretically. But it is another
thing to learn it by experience. I don't know
which is worse  to find that those who have
been, as you thought, unselfishly kind, were
mercenary all the while  or that those who
were most selfishly unkind, before, are ready
to take you to their heart of hearts, now. I
have had my eyes opened, and my old illusions
pretty thoroughly dispelled. But I

think  I do think I have been saved, thus
far, from the other extreme. I know I have
been very near that other extreme, often,
during those months that have passed since
the night when I left you so  so hurriedly.
Two things, I think, kept me from it."

What were they, Arthur ?"

' One was the remarkably plain-spoken
letter your father sent me. That letter refreshed
me, more than I can tell you. Of
course, I regretted that he should have put a
stop to our correspondence. But the letter
was like a tonic to me, at the time.  The
other thing was that same conversation with
Mr. Mallory, of which I have been telling

you."

How was that, Arthur ? Did he not try
to persuade you  "

He tried to persuade me that darkness
was light, and conversely. And I don't deny
that his words influenced me, though not in
the way that he intended. I might have
struck a bargain with Mr. Mallory, but it
would have been quite an everyday kind of

bargain  I had no thought of ' selling my
soul,' as your father feared I had done or
might do. But what he said brought many
things into my mind.  I will tell you, Gertrude,
what was almost the first thing I did,
after leaving Mr. Mallory. I went to my
rooms, took out from my desk that letter of
Hume's, and read it again. You have heard
about the letter, I daresay?"

Yes. I have heard about it."

It came to me, as you know, a message
from the dead. I know nothing about Hume,
except what that letter tells me, but it tells me
enough. It seemed to me, as I read it that
day, almost prophetic. It put everything ina
quite different light from Mr. Mallory's."

Tell me what he said to you ?"

He said very much what 5ou have been
saying to-night. He spoke of my father.
He bade me copy his belief in the better
side of human nature. He warned me
against letting my riches make me selfish,
careless of others, and content only to be
rich."

" You did not need any such advice, I
know !"

*' I am not quite sure about that. At all
events, that is the advice which I shall follow.
You are right, Gertrude  there are ways,
many ways, of using this money that has
come to me for an end such as would have
rejoiced my father's heart  and, with help 
yes, with help  I think I shall find one of
them. But first, I hope to make that long-talked
of visit to the Valdarno.  And now that
I have confessed to you, Gertrude  now let us
see what Shawkirk is doing to the sunset."

They went into what had once been the
outer court of the Lynnfield Works, whence
they could see straight down the valley to the
murky walls and many stalks of Shawkirk.
It was not a beautiful view  in front, a bare
valley gashed with a railway which crossed
the winding stream on numerous iron viaducts
; beyond, mean, dingy houses huddled
together on either hill-side, with soot-begrimed
church-spires rising above them ; on the river-banks,
the dirty-red, many-windowed piles,

VOL. ni. T

whose tall chimneys blackened out the crimson
of the West.

Gertrude, leaning on the broken wall with
her head resting on her hand, looked down the
valley, as Lynn thought, somewhat wistfully.
And in truth, the girl's heart was full. Her
brother, whom she had loved despite his
faults, had gone away. To-morrow, Caroline,
who had been to her what one sister of two is
to another, would have left the house for ever.
Her cousin, who  she could not hide it from
herself  was far dearer to her than brother or
sister  would, in a few days at most, have
gone in search of more congenial surroundings,
and who could tell when she might see him
again ? The old house would be duller, now,
than ever it had been. Her mother was still
inconsolable for the loss of her favourite ; and
her father seemed still well-nigh crushed by
the blow which Dick's misconduct had inflicted.
Her own duty lay plain before her.
She must do all she might to help her parents
in their grief. She must not add to their
sorrow by showing any sign of despondency.

She would do her best to brighten their lives ;
but she had to confess that her own life would
henceforth be hopelessly vapid and dreary.
It now appeared as if Shawkirk must be for
her the world ; and life at Shawkirk had of
late seemed narrower and bleaker than ever.
It only took light and colour on the days when
Arthur Lynn was among them.  There had
for long been an aching pain at her heart ; and
she felt at the moment as if it would henceforth
be more than she could bear. Then she
humbled herself. What right had she to be
discontented with her lot  to dream foolish
dreams ? And on the eve of Caroline's marriage,
was it not wicked of her to yield to
such selfish sadness, when she ought to be
happy in her sister s happiness ? This washer
world, and she must go through it with
a brave spirit and a smiling face.  Nevertheless,
as she gazed down the valley, her eyes
filed with tears.

Lynn's reflections, meanwhile, were of a
somewhat different cast. He had asked
Gertrude to walk with him that evening 

he had led their steps, of all places, to the
Factory of the Past  designing to tell her
of his love. But now, when the moment
for speaking had come, he shrank from requiring
the answer that must decide his
future.

He could scarcely account for his own
hesitation. He had been conscious of no
such shrinking, in making his declaration to
Camilla Arden. With her, he had been
swept away by a torrent of passion in which
thought had scarcely mingled. That passion,
when he had allowed himself to think of it
with any calmness, he had owned to be at
war with the serious purpose of his life. But
it had been so strangely sweet, so potent in its
witchery, that even the sacrifice of his highest
aims had seemed a cheap price to pay for its
joys, however transient and illusive. But the
glamour had faded. He was a stronger man
now, and his love was a stronger love. That
very power over it of which he was conscious
the power to control its expression  assured
him that there was a depth, an obligingness in

his affection for Gertrude, which had been
wanting in that passion of his romantic days.

It seemed to him now as if his love for
Gertrude had been an undercurrent flowing
T\dthout interruption through his whole life 
a thing so much a part of himself that he had
been scarce able to realise it. But of late,
since he had been separated from her, he
had come to realise it. Of late, her image
had been constantly with him. The thought
that her heart might be given to another had
pained him, with a dull sense of pain ; that
moment of mistake, in which he had seen her
set for ever beyond his reach, had revealed
to him, as it were in a flash, the force and
intensity of his love for her.

He knew now that all along he had been
mistaken ; that her heart had been given, if
not to him, at least to no other ; and yet he
almost feared to speak. She, if she loved him
now, must have loved him always. But he ! 
he could not osier her a virgin heart. If she
loved him  then he had been untrue to her.
If she did not love him, what would his life

be worth ? His love for her, he felt, was inwoven
with his most earnest thoughts, his
strongest purposes, his highest hopes. If it
must perish, could these endure ?

"Gertrude," he said at last, *when I was
in London  before I went abroad  I saw
Camilla Arden."

Gertrude started, and turned towards him.
His face was averted from her, so that she
could not see its expression ; but she thought
from the tone of his voice that he was forcing
himself to say what he would rather have left
unsaid  what he was almost ashamed to say.
In her highly-wrought state of feeling, this
abrupt mention of Camilla Arden's name was
like a sting to her. The fire of woman's
jealousy, though but a flash that passed as
quickly as it came, dried the tears that had
gathered in her eyes, and lent her for the
moment an almost feverish energy of voice
and gesture.

I thought so !" she said. " I was sure of
it, when you came back so happy, and so  so
like what you used to be And you

forgave her ! Oh, she must love you ! She
cannot but love you now ! . . . And now, at
last, you will be happy  happy with her
after aU !"

She spoke with tremulous eagerness ; her
hands were clasped tightly together ; her grey
eyes seemed to darken and dilate with new
light. The thought of what this excitement
might betoken filled Lynn with a sudden
humiliation. He felt, as he had never felt
before, the unworthiness of all he could offer
in exchange for Gertrude's love. The very
strength of his love for her impelled him to
lay bare  even to unconsciously magnify  his
own weakness and blindness in the past.

Gertrude," he said, " you are strangely
mistaken. I did forgive Camilla Arden, but
at the same time I bade her farewell for ever.
I do not know that I have a right to speak
of forgiving. When I look back on it all, I
feel that I, at least, have no right to reproach
her. At Leipsic, I told myself again and
again that I was following a path that could
never lead to happiness. In London, it was

the same. I never felt sire of her, even in
the days when I thought I could not live
without seeing her. I tormented myself, and
her, with my doubts  I could never believe ina
happy end to it all  sometimes I even felt
afraid of what might befall us both, if she

ever did become mine You know the

whole story. No doubt, she was to blame ;
but it is not for me to blame her  I myself
am not free from reproach. I should have
known  certainly I should have known ! 
. . . I have been very blind  very blind
and very foolish. I want you to know that
I am at least aware how weak I have been
because  because I love you as I never
loved before. It seems to me now as if I
must have loved you always. Yes, I have
come to my senses at last. That is the
thing I wanted to say to you  I brought
you here that I might say it. Tell me,
Gertrude  it is not too late?"

She did not speak ; he could not see her
face. But he saw that she made a slight,
impulsive movement towards him ; he caught

her hands, and drawing her closer to him,
looked into her eyes.

"Gertrude," he said, "you are crying!
My own  my dearest ! Now, indeed, you
are mine ! "

I have always been yours, Arthur," she
whispered; and next moment he had taken
her into his arms, and strained her to his
heart.

And thus the affection that had taken root
in the dawn of their lives, that had strengthened
with the years and made fragrant the
chambers of the past  about which clustered
so many memories of sisterly tenderness, of
eager sympathy, of shy solicitude  was
crowned at last with the magical flower
around which 'all the muses sing.'
