CHAPTER 1.

IX THE ROSE GARDEN.

Big Reginald Haggard had been exceedingly

attentive to the elder of two very pretty

girls of the name of Warrender. Both

families came from the eastern counties.

The Warrenders had inhabited The Warren,

or at all events the older portion of the

house, for nearly four centuries. They were

harmless people. They manfully stuck to

their ancestral acres of fat Essex land. The

present head of the family farmed the greater

part of the estate himself, as his fathers had

done before him. Many a Warrender had

held the rich living of King's Warren, and

the parson, whoever lie might be, and the
vol. i. 1

reigning Squire Warrender were always the
two greatest men in King's Warren village
and parish.

In the rather old-fashioned garden at The
Warren sat a young lady, an open bock upon
her lap ; the book was not a novel, it was
an argumentative work, a book which dealt
with the social problems of the day. But,
alas ! the book which Georgia Warrender
had brought out with the serious intention
of reading, for the Warrenders of either sex,
though always soft-hearted, were a hardheaded
race, lay upside down upon her lap.
The fact is that she was weighing a man
in the balance, an interesting occupation fora
lady, and, alas ! finding him a little wanting.
George Warrender had received a
great deal of attention during the London
season. Her people were well-to-do, the
ancestral freeholds were unencumbered, her
family was eminently respectable and well
known, her connections unimpeachable ; but
Miss Warrender's principal attraction to those

who Lad the privilege of her acquaintance
outside the world of balls, dinner parties
and musical evenings, was the sturdy openheartedness
of her character, which often
distinguishes well brought-up young ladies
who have been reared in an atmosphere
at once intelligent and healthy, but not
ultra-intellectual. Miss Warrender had no
craze. She played and sang sufficiently well,
but not well enough to be a terror to the
home circle. She drew and sketched, as a
pastime, but she had no desire to compete
with professional artists, nor was her conversation
interlarded with the jargon of the
craft. Her reading had been carefully
directed by her governess, Miss Hood, who
had remained to discharge the onerous
duties of chaperon, guide, philosopher, and,
above all, friend to Geonne Warrender and
her cousin Lucy.

Lucy Warrender was George's cousin on
the father's side. Colonel Warrender, as

the younger brother, was naturally intended

12

for the family living of King's Warren. But
fiery young George Warrender declined the
Church altogether, so he was sent to Hails
and then he became a soldier of John
Company, and was soon known as Fighting
George Warrender, and by dint of following
his own bent attained the colonelcy of
a native regiment. Then he had a good
determined shake at the pagoda tree. And
then he made a fool of himself, for just ashe
had come down to Bombay, having made
up his mind to take two years' leave, he
was smitten by the blonde beauty of a
newly-imported " spin," fresh from the
boarding-school ; and being an impulsive
man, Colonel George Warrender married the
little boarding-school miss, and changed his
mind about his furlough. Within a year
his daughter Lucy was born. And then
the cholera came to Bebreabad, swept off
Colonel Warrender and his pale-faced child-wife
; and the little Lucy, his orphan
daughter, came home at once in charge

of an ayah in the Company's ship "Lord
Give." On her arrival Squire Warrender
pitied the little misery, as she was called
by everybody, and treated her as his own
daughter. There was but two years' difference
between the girls, and they looked
upon each other as sisters. The squire's
wife had died within a year of his daughter's
birth, so that practically neither of the
cousins had ever known a mother's care.
Squire Warrender's wife had been a local
beauty, and her portrait, which hung in Mr.
Warrender's stay, represented a loveliness
of no common type.

Both the girls rode well, but neither was
horsey nor doggy. One of the greatest attractions
in everybody's eyes about George
Warrender was her openness ; she never
had a secret from Miss Hood, her father,
or her cousin. In fact, secrecy was foreign
to her nature. As to her appearance, she
was a fine, well-developed, thoroughly English
gir 1 , fully justifying the raptures an 1 rhapsodies

of her numerous admirers. But it is
not with her appearance that we are at
present concerned, but with the subject of
her meditations.

That subject was a serious one, for in
her pocket was a formal proposal from
Reginald Haggard, whom she had known
as " Big Reginald Haggard " from her childhood.
It is probably an axiom that every
English girl, under ordinary circumstances,
accepts her first offer ; the reason of this
is not very manifest, but it is nevertheless
a fact, and its being a fact is doubtless
one of the causes of the numerous ill-assorted
matches that constantly take
place. But Miss Warrender, now twenty
years of age, had been an exception to
the rule. During her first and successful
London season, now just over, she had
refused three serious offers. The first was
from an impecunious young barrister, who
had attained some repute in the literary
world, and had very nearly killed himself

in the process. Mr. Baliol had admired
Miss Warrender, had made careful inquiries
as to her father's position, had discovered
that the two girls would probably be the
old man's heiresses, and had promptly proposed
to George. He had been as promptly
refused. Mr. Baliol was in no wise disconcerted.
He immediately proceeded to dedicate
his new novel, " A Woman's Fickle

Heart," "to Miss G W , in token

of respectful admiration." Baliol scored
another success at the circulating libraries,
and at once ceased to trouble himself anymore

about Miss G W .

Georgina's second proposal was of a more
serious nature. Young Lord Spunyarn had
made her an offer. Lord Spunyarn desired
an ornamental wife. To him the ideal Lady
Spunyarn was a young person respectably
connected, good-tempered, and of prepossessing
appearance. Not one iota did Spunyarn
care for money, birth or brains ; of money
he had plenty and to spare : as to birth,

Alas lie not Lord Spunyarn ? as to brains,
clever women were considered bores by his
lordship. The young nobleman liked George
Warrender, and he liked her people. Though
rejected, rather to his astonishment, it made
no difference in his friendship with the family.
It's an awful bore, you know. Unluckily
they all know it at the club  I mean that
I w T as going to make you an offer  and I
heard that one of the society journals had
the announcement of our engagement already
in type. You see, I was to have dined here
tomorrow. If you don't mind, I'll come all
the same." He did come, did full justice
to the dinner, sat next to George, whom he
took down, and the pair, thoroughly heart-whole,
had a great deal to say to each
other.

Georgina's next experience was of a more
comic character ; her conquest was no longer
a nobleman, but a " noble." Jones di Mentes
was a Maltese noble. He possessed
certain rights of nobility in the island, his

income was derived from the sale of Maltese
oranges ; in fact he was the titular head of
Jones and Co., the well-known fruit house
of Thames Street. In Thames Street, Jones
di Monte-ferret said nothing about his
nobility, he was " our Mr. Jones." But
on his visiting cards was a portentous crown,
and Jones di Monte-ferret habitually wore a
coloured boutonniere in his frock coat ; being
red, this decoration was popularly supposed
to be the Legion of Honour : it had been
purchased however, and purchased cheaply,
from the Pope. Jones' nobility carried him
far in Maid Yale and Bays water. Needless
to tell, Miss Warrender would have nothing
to say to him.

To say that George Warrender was perfectly
heart whole as she unfolded Haggard's
letter, is nothing but the truth. Of course
she liked young Haggard, but so did everyone.
Haggard had enjoy r ed an extraordinary
popularity. Related as he was to the Earl
of Pit Town, he was a welcome guest in

the best houses. lie had been a dancing
man, and could dance well, was exceedingly

good-looking, and consequently a catch at
the small and earliest and also at more elaborate
entertainments. When a very young
man he had been a detrimental, having
rapidly dissipated his little fortune. Penniless,
he went to America; in eight years he
returned, well off, as good-looking as ever,
and with the possibility, the extremely unlikely
possibility, of one day succeeding to
the earldom of Pit Town. There are some
men who always fall on their feet, some
men for whom fortune is never tired of
turning up trumps ; Haggard was one of these
men. When it is said that Haggard was
a man of the world in its broadest sense,
nothing remains to tell. If he had a
religion at all it was the w r worship of his
own dear self. Big Reginald remembered
George Warrender as a chit of twelve ; he-met
her again one of the brightest ornaments
of London society ; he heard her

spoken of there as handsome Miss Warrender ;
and just as he would have longed for a
very valuable hunter to carry his sixteen
stone to hounds, so he desired to obtain
George's hand ; because without doubt
she was the handsomest, healthiest, pleas-attest
and most unexceptionable girl it had
ever been his good fortune to come across.

The letter seemed honest enough, it was
short and to the point.

"Dear Miss Warrender,

You will probably not be surprised
at my addressing you on a subject important
to us both. We have known each
other since the time when you were a little
girl and I was a big bad boy. I don't
trouble you with business matters, but I
have spoken to Mr. Warrender and fully
satisfied him on that head. It is with his
approbation that I ask you to become my
wife. I know that the very remote possibility
of a coronet will not weigh with you,

but I do think you ought to let it count
against my disadvantages. You will get
this at breakfast time. I shall ride over
about eleven to urge my suit in person ;
may I hope that your good nature will
spare me the negative I doubtless deserve,
and that you will give me a chance ?
Yours very affectionately,

Begin alt Haggard."

As George replaced the letter in . its
envelope she blushed ; had Haggard been
indifferent to her she would not have hung
out this signal of distress. It is impossible
to follow the course of reasoning of a
woman's mind. George Warrender was no
raw girl to be caught by the mere good
looks of big Reginald. But first impressions
go a great way ; she remembered the
young fellow in the reckless daring of his
first youth ; she remembered, too, her feeling
of pity when she heard of the prodigal's
banishment to a far country to feed the

proverbial swine. George remembered, too,
the triumphant return of that prodigal
some six months ago. She had been pleased
at the prodigal's attentions, and she knew
that many girls, of far greater social pretensions
than her own, would willingly have
accepted the addresses of the bronzed,
curly-headed giant with the big moustache.
Perhaps she would have been wiser had
she taken counsel with Miss Hood, or had
she deliberated more calmly. But George
was a self-reliant girl. Even now she
heard the measured tread of her lover's
hack as he trotted up to the hall door of
The Warren. She looked at her watch, it
wanted five minutes of the hour. Miss
Warrender smiled at her lover's excessive
punctuality ; his impatience boded well she
thought.

Another instant and he is striding down
the path of the rose garden; a happy look
is on his face, though it is slightly pale
with suppressed excitement. George War-render's

pink roses attain a damask hue
as she rises to greet him.

Fortune, fickle goddess, still befriends
her favourite. There was no outward
sign of hesitation or diffidence about Haggard,
as he held out his hand to Miss
Warrender.

It's very good of you to see me ; I'm
afraid I don't deserve it," he said, seating
himself beside her on the rustic bench,
and, man-like, commencing to bore holes
in the gravel with the stout ash-plant
which he carried. Youth and maid decorously
continued to gaze upon the ground
and to critically study their own foot coverings.
Haggard was a man who looked
well in any dress, but the grey tweed suit
which he wore, the artistic bit of red of
his loosely-tied sailor's knot, his big grey
felt hat, his leggings also of tweed, even
his stout but well-made lace-up boots seem
to give the young giant the needful halo
of romance. This, the usual morning dress

of a young English gentleman in the
country, is what is generally selected as
the costume of the hero of an Delphi
drama, when that wonderful young man
is discovered in his virtuous home prior
to the commencement of his numerous
sufferings and hair-breadth escapes. As
for George, the conventional French muslin
set off her faultless figure, a large Leghorn

O ' CD C

hat protected her delicate complexion from
the sun's rays, her magnificent hair was
worn in the rather severe Grecian style,
but then the big plait at the back was all
her own, and the bronze chestnut locks,
tightly strained as they were around her
head, disclosed the small shell-like ear, that
sign of breeding which it is impossible to
counterfeit. Probably George Warrender
had been right when, as a girl, she had
declined to have those pretty ears pierced.
If we accept the hypothesis that beauty
unadorned is adorned the most, then George
in her native loveliness was, indeed, highly

decorated. But she was nervous in this
formal tete-astute; this showed itself in her
heightened colour, which was still maintained,
and in the occasional movement of
her delicately fashioned little bronze shoes.
As Sir John Suckling said long ago :

Her feet "beneath her petticoat,
Like little mice peeped in and out,
As though they feared the light."

The quotation is somewhat hackneyed, perhaps
; but it ran through Reginald Haggard's
mind, as he prodded his stick into the gravel.

"I'm afraid, Miss Warre rider, that I have
betrayed you into a tete-astute. Your father
washed me luck, and told me I should find
you here, while your cousin informed me
that w T e should be quite undisturbed. May
I hope that you will give me a chance ;
that possibly, after a time, I may not altogether
be indifferent to you, George ? "
Again the rosy flush mantled on the girl's
tell-tale cheek. Haggard continued, " Of
course you have seen, dear George, that

I have been very hard hit this season, fora
lazy ne'er-do-weel like myself to dance
attendance at every entertainment that
Miss Warrender graced with her presence,
must have made the state of my affections
pretty manifest I suppose. We have known
each other a long time. I have never done
anything mean or dirty that I know of,
George. Of course I was a young fool
and kicked up my heels as young fools.
But I think I have had all the nonsense
knocked out of me. My roving life
in Mexico and my chase after the almighty
dollar have sobered me. Can you trust
me, George ? I'll be good to you, upon
my word I will. Good to you and proud
of you, if you'll only give me the chance.
You are too clever for me to attempt to
argue you into it. But, dear George, I
love you as I never loved any woman
breathing, and not with the nitre passing
fancy of a boy. I have seen the world

and a good deal of life, the gilded and
Vil. i. 2

the seamy sides. Tell me, George. May
I hope ? Will you give me a chance?"

George looked into his eyes and smiled.
He had spoken it trippingly on the tongue,
though seemingly spontaneous, it had been
well thought out ; for Haggard was an actor,
a leading gentleman, well experienced in
lovers' roles. It is not meant by this that
Haggard was what the old song calls a " star-breasted
villain." But George Warrender
was not by any means his first love. Haggard
looked upon George as a valuable
acquisition ; from the physical point of view
she was the finest, freshest, fairest girl he
had come across. And he coveted her as
an amateur covets a picture ; that it may
belong to him, and that others may fruitlessly
desire his pearl of great price. True,
no sordid consideration influenced Haggard.
Can we call this love ? Let us be charitable
and do so. But we will also be just
and qualify. It was love of the nineteenth
century, of the society type.

"You pay me a great compliment, Mr.
Haggard, a very undeserved compliment.
I cannot pretend to be taken by surprise,
for, as you say, your attentions have been
very marked. What am I to say to you ?
With a girl it is a very serious matter ;
for once we give our hearts, at least some
of us, Mr. Haggard, we give them for good
and all. A mistake once made, in our case,
cannot be set right. Our affections once
given away to a man, and perhaps afterwards
flung aside, then leave us with nothing
to bestow but our miserable selves. Are
you quite sure you have made up your
mind, and that you won't want to change
it?" she said, looking up archly in his face.

But his teeth were set, and the muscles
of his massive jaw were working hard, ashe
gazed intently on the gravel at his feet.
It was evidently no laughing matter with
Hazard. The muscles of his jaw had

DO 

worked in a similar way only a week ago,
when he stood on the grand stand at Epsom,

and saw the favourite, whom he had
backed heavily, almost " collared " on the
post ; but the favourite had won, and Dark
Despair had failed to land the odds of
sixty to one laid against him. So had the
muscles of Eeginald Haggard's jaw worked
when he had " bluffed " Don Emmanuel Garcia
at the almost historical game of poker, which
they had played at Chihuahua. Haggard
had only held knave high, about as small
a hand as a poker player can hold ; he
had successfully " bluffed " the Mexican,
and won. He is blushing now, for hearts
are trumps at the game that is being played ;
and we, who look over the cards of both
hands, can see that bi Hesrinald's at least
is a poor one. Will he win? Of course
he will. What chance has George War-render
against so experienced a player?
The stakes were Haggard's before he had
cut or shuffled the cards.

Sure, George ? of course I'm sure. I
may hope, then ? T may dare to hope ? "

Wise man as lie was, he carried, the
place by a determined rush. He took
her hand in his, the taper little fingers
were not withdrawn.

George, darling, how can I thank
you ? I am not good at this sort of
thing.' ,

If he had. not attained perfection in the
art of love, it was certainly not for want
of practice ; for if the truth be told, the
big Lothario habitually made love to every
pretty woman he met ; and if there was
no pretty woman, then to the least unprepossessing
one of those present, The
rest of the conversation went on much as
such conversations usually do. Haggard
swore eternal constancy. George confessed
that she " supposed she did care for him."
But this modified sympathy did not satisfy
Haggard ; he pleaded for something more
explicit.

"I have always liked you, Mr. Haggard,"
she said, for George could not yet bring herself

to address lier lover by his Christian name ;
"but I fear I must seem a very poor
creature after all the dashing South-american
beauties, to say nothing of the many recognized
successes of the past season."

But you were the success of the past
season, George. Everybody knows it Why,
they raved about you. You must know
very well that Madame Hortense made a
little fortune with the ' Warrender ' hat."

Ah, that was Lucy's idea, not mine, Mr.
Haggard."

"A very charming idea, George, but
never so charming as when you wore it."

George Warrender rose and made him a
low courtesy. "I see you deal in sugared
compliments," she said.

He got up and offered his arm.

The hideous and snobbish custom of
taking a lady's arm had not then been invented.
And to do him justice, even if
it had, Haggard was too much of a gentleman
to have attempted it. For customs borrowed

from the habits of the demi raonde
would have been sadly out of place with
a girl like George Warrender. With her
cousin it might have been different; but
with George the thins: would have been
impossible.

As the extent of his own good luck began
to dawn upon Haggard, he felt that the
world had indeed gone very well with him ;
for as he had marched down the walk of the
old-fashioned rose garden that morning, for the
first time in his life he had felt diffident of
success ; for the first time in his life he now
vowed in his fickle mind to be true to the
smiling girl who, in the bright glamour of
a first love, hung so confidingly on Ins arm.
Of course he vowed eternal constancy. At
lovers' perjuries they say Jove laughs, and
well might the whole Olympian chorus have
joined in the loud guffaw with which the
king of all the gods doubtlessly greeted
the protestations of Fortune's favourite. As
each drank deep draughts of the subtle

poison from the other's eyes, their glances
grew brighter, and they were only awakened
from the dream that comes to ns all, at
least once in our lifetimes, by the imperious
clash of the luncheon-bell. Old Mr.
Warrender and Lucy appeared upon the
lawn, and the broad smile on her fathers
face and Lucy's merry laugh told the happy
pair that they might spare any explanation.
George, in the pride of her honest love,
disdained to take her hand from the young
man's arm. With womanly dignity she
advanced to meet her delighted father. He
kissed her on the forehead, and then the
blushing girl took refuge in her cousin's
affectionate embrace.

Be good to her, my boy," said Squire
Warrender, his honest voice a little broken
as he thought of the old days of his own
too short-lived happiness, and of the proud
dead beauty, George 1 s mother. It was a
short speech, but it rang in Eeginald Haggard's
ears for many a year.

Will lie be good to her? He should be.
If not good to her, surely Eeginald Haggard
will be less than a door.

THE CROQUET PARTY.

Everybody agreed that the day had been a
success. The lawn at The Warren was
an ideal croquet - lawn, large, level, and
causeless. It was an old lawn, and was carefully
watered. What better place, then, for
the local tournament to be fought out
upon, than the old lawn at The Warren.

At last the final game has been
played. The day had been excessively
warm. Everybody was sitting in the
shade discussing the claret-cup, the syllabus,
the strawberries and cream, and
the home-made confectionery, that were so
freely pressed upon the large and rather
miscellaneous assemblage which filled the
old - fashioned grounds of Diggory War-render.
The owner of this archaic name

we have met for an instant in the preceding
chapter. He was a hale old country
gentleman, a J. P. for his county, and universally
liked. Perhaps there was more of
the yeoman than the squire about old Mr.
Warrender. Though he farmed many acres,
yet he did so at a profit, strange to say.
But perhaps this is hardly to be wondered
at when it is remembered that the acres
were his own, and that consequently there
was no rent to pay.

Mr. Warrender, who rather scorned
claret-cup, was about to discuss the merits
of a foaming tankard of home-brewed ale.
The ale was good ; perhaps it tasted the
better to old Warrender as he drank it
from the silver tankard of the time of
Charles I., which bore the name and arms
of his ancestor, Diggory Warrender, armiger,
of that epoch.

Won't you try some, Lord Spunyarn ? "
old Warrender said ; " It has made me the
man I am," and certainly this statement was

a flaming testimonial to the merits of the
Warren ale ; for old Warrender, who stood
six feet in his socks, seemed to be all muscle,
while his white and perfect teeth, he being a
man of sixty-five, proved that, at all events as
yet, physical decay had not set in in the
master of The Warren.

But Lord Spunyarn shook his head as he
signed to the butler to give him what he
termed a B. and S.

Beer is too bulky for me, Warrender,"
said the spindle-shanked nobleman, as he
stretched out his shapely but rather shaky
hand for the panacea. " I object to bulk,
Warrender, on principle ; it is my terror of
becoming a welterweight that made me go
in for athletics, Why, look at my father,
and they had to make a hole in the Avail
to get my grandfather's coffin out of the
house. No, Warrender, mind and muscle are
my strong points."

And so they were in Lord Spunyarn' s own
idea. Spunyarn was perpetually in training.

He was ever matched against somebody, or
against that very successful competitor, Father
Time. But Spunyarn was never " fit," to
use a sporting term. Naturally of a weakly
constitution, his originally puny form had
been carefully educated and developed at
the great public school where athletics,
tone," and Latin verse, are the only
subjects seriously taught. Spunyarn had
failed to catch the " tone," Latin verse was
a closed book to him, but he stuck to
athletics. The name of Lord Spunyarn was
constantly to be seen in the sporting prints,
and though Spunyarn pluckily struggled
along, coming in last in the foot races, being
knocked about in the middle-weight boxing
matches (knockings about which, to his
credit it must be said, he bore with the
patience of a martyr), yet, with all his sufferings,
no single trophy as yet adorned Lord
Spunyarn's rooms in Jenny n Street.

To-day Spunyarn had been beaten in the
croquet tournament, and his partner had put

down their united failure to the presence of
Lord Spunyarn, while Spunyarn himself when
they were beaten simply remarked, " Great
mistake not taking the matutinal B. and S.,
you know." This hardly consoled the smart
young lawyer, his lordship's partner, for his
day's loss of time, his hotel bill, and his new
and elaborate morning kit ; still, he had had
the honour of playing with a lord.

But metal more attractive soon compelled
Spunyarn's attention, for his eyes fell upon
the two pretty Warrender girls as they
tripped towards the aged host, both hanging
on the willing arms of the new Essex
lion, Eeggie Haggard.

Big Reginald Haggard was the ideal of
the country maiden. He was not hideously
beautiful, as it has become the fashion to
depict the heroes of modern romance. It
may at once be said that Haggard was undeniably
good-looking. His long black
moustache gave him, in the eyes of the
ladies assembled at The Warren, the necessary

romantic air. What is very much to the
point in such matters was the fact that he
was also extremely well dressed. He had the
military neatness without the military
swagger, and for the first time in his life
Haggard's well-cut clothes were paid for, to
the unspeakable pleasure and astonishment
of his tailor. For Reginald Haggard, who
eight years ago had left the paternal mansion
an expatriated black sheep, had returned a
man of comparative wealth. Turned loose
a mere boy in London, his money had been
spent, as young men about town usually
spend their money. That young but very
fashionable club, the Pandemonium, that club
which has an oyster cellar in its basement,
which keeps open all night, and at which
shilling cigars are tie rigueur, had been the
cause of most of young Haggard's embarrassments.
At the Pandemonium Haggard had
made the acquaintance of Captains Spotstroke
and Pool, half-pay ; that acquaintance had
naturally proved expensive. Bets ware made

and paid. Haggard was introduced to the
bill-discounting fraternity, and had even
lunched with the great Hyam Hyams ; which
fact shows how deep he was in the books of
that great connoisseur and money-lender.
As a rule Hyams's business lay only with
members of the aristocracy, but Eeginald
Haggard was accepted as a client because he
was distantly related to the Earl of Pit Town.
Three lives, three good lives, stood between
Haggard and the childless earl. There are
such things as contingent post-obits. In
these precarious commodities the fortune of
Mr. Hyam Hyams had been made, under the
astute advice of his solicitor, Mr. Morris
Israelss, of Bloomsbury Square, and it was to
these precious securities that his dealings
with young Haggard were confined. But at
length Hyams would advance no more.
Haggard, at an alarming sacrifice, parted
with his jewellery, bid his family farewell, and
quitted Essex for South America. At the
expiration of eight years Haggard returned

as a landed proprietor, the owner of numerous
ranches, and of countless flocks and herds.
His liabilities in England consisted solely of
his debt to Hyani Hyams. This debt, however,
was only payable in the rather unlikely
contingency of his succeeding to the earldom
of Pit Town. Also, much in opposition to
the wishes of that respected solicitor, Mr.
Morris Israelss, a power had been reserved to
Eeginald Haggard to pay off both the principal
and its interest at any time, in the
extremely unlikely event of his ever having
the money to do so. Such was Haggard's
position when he became engaged, as has been
narrated, to Georgina, Squire Warrender's
handsome daughter, at the end of her first
and triumphant London season. It has been
noted that among George's numerous and
most assiduous admirers had been our friend
Spunyarn. He had proposed to and been
rejected by George, but they still remained
sworn friends.

The two girls, the elder of whom was but
vol. i. 3

twenty, her cousin being two years younger,
presented a striking contrast. George was
a remarkably line girl of the true English
type. Three centuries of Warrenders, a
family which began as yeomen, but soon took
its place in the squirearchy of its county, had
transmitted to George that healthy type, that
sound physique and that clear complexion,
which is seen only in England ; and even in
England, only among healthy rustics, or the
women of those families of the upper class
who habitually pass the greater portion of
the year out of London. Not that George
Warrender was a mere rustic beauty, as her
taper hands and tiny feet showed. It takes a
good foot to look well in a w T asking shoe, and
even in the trying walking shoe George's
foot was unmistakably a good one. Her
clear blue eyes were honest and sympathetic ;
George Warrender looked every one straight
in the face, she had evidently nothing to
conceal, nothing to be ashamed or afraid of.
The two girls had been carefully educated,

the " colonies " having been wisely omitted.
George's magnificent chestnut bronze hair
was her great attraction. It is needless to
say that a lock of it was in Haggard's pocketbook,
and that one of Haggard's raven curls
was worn in George's locket. The engagement
was an open one. There was no
self-consciousness about either of the
parties. They were both evidently proud
of it.

Lucy was in many respects the exact opposite
of her cousin. Lucy was a blonde ; pretty,
rather in the American style. But unlike most
American beauties, far from being a mere
skeleton in a skin, Lucy was a plump, well-developed
specimen of the dreamy blonde. In
type she much resembled the descriptions of
Madame de Pompadour in her youth, before
she had seen and captivated the great-grandson
of the Grand Monarque. She was
mignonne, no other word will express it. Her
strong points were her pink and white complexion,
her masses of wavy golden hair, hera

9.

dark eyebrows and her magnificent hazel
eyes ; those dark dreamy eyes in which lurked
latent fires. Young as she was, Lucy well
knew how to use those eyes, and the way in
which she gazed into the face of her cousin's
betrothed seemed to detract nothing from his
happiness. But in the same way she gazed
into Spunyarn's face, it was not mere looking,
it was " gazing." So she had gazed into the
local general-practitioner's eyes when that
poor young man looked at her tongue for the
first time. It was Lucy Warrender's burning
glance that had temporarily made the village
doctor a discontented man, and had caused
him to style his mid-day hashed mutton

jn

muck."

In direct contrast, too, to her cousin's, was
Lucy's mind. She was not a girl who could
be loved by other girls. Save when employed
in " gazing " she never looked any one straight
in the face. The servants, our stern and
acute judges, said that "Miss Lucy wasn't to
be trusted, but that Miss George was as

good as gold." As usual, the servants were
right.

Unsuccessful again, Lord Spunyarn," said
Lucy, dropping him an ironical courtesy, and
making a provoking little none.

"As usual, and I suppose my own fault,
though my last serious failure was certainly
not my fault, but entirely due to you, Miss
Warrender."

It was certainly not your lordship's misfortune,"
smiled the young lady.

Haggard and his fiancee seemed to have a
good deal to say to each other, but probably
like that of most engaged persons, their conversation
was merely childish.

And now the little crowd of players and
spectators came to make their adieux. For
in the country people still retain the fashion
of bidding their hosts good-bye. Nay,
more, they are in the habit of even thanking
them for their entertainment, and for the
pleasure they have received : whereas your
fashionable, having had all there is to have,

and eaten and drank of what seemeth unto him
good, carefully rejecting the less recherche
viands, simply disappears. He was, and is
not.

The Warrender girls were surrounded by a
cluster of artless maidens ; these shook hands
and kissed, after the manner of their kind, and
as they w T ere more or less intimate with their
hostesses. " He is perfect, quite perfect,"
whispered the rector's romantic sister, as she
squeezed George's hand, " but, oh, I do hope
that you are sure of his principles, George,
dear, for in marriage so much depends, dear,
upon principles." As Haggard's only principles
were his personal comfort, filliped b} r the gentle
stimulus of frequent flirtations, was George
quite right in replying, " Oh, dear Miss Dodd, I
am quite sure of his principles ? " Gradually
the miscellaneous gathering took its departure.
No man or male person left the premises
without one of Lucy's fatal oeillades ; each one
of the stronger sex, too, received a rather more
than necessary pressure of her soft and dimpled

hand. Many among the elders, nay, the
patriarchs even, felt their pulses quicken at
the unexpected pressure and the sly bright
glances ; it made them feel, not as if they
were smitten with the good looks of Lucy
Warrender, but as if she herself had been captivated
by the prepossessing appearance and
manners of each special victim. That was the
art of it.

The dinner that evening at The Warren
was a cheerful one ; the humours of the day
were described with biting satire by the gentle
Lucy. She it was who had cruelly incited the
stout vicar to elephantine gambols, to the
intense disgust and annoyance of his angular
wife. Who but Lucy could have caused the
coldness between young farmer Wurzel and
his affianced bride, Miss Grains, the brewer's
daughter ? Who but Lucy, as she sat on the
shafts of the horse roller, listening with apparently
rapt attention to the lucubrations of
young Wurzel on the subject of shorthorns.
Perhaps the clasped hands and the ecstatic

look were hardly necessary, for even so interesting
a subject as stock breeding. But Lucy
had noted, out of the corner of her watchful
eye, the arrival of Miss Grains, indignant and
perspiring.

You'll excuse him, Miss Warrender, it's
more thoughtlessness than want of manners ;
but he oughtn't to be taking up your time like
this," cried the brewer's daughter, as she bore
off her reluctant prize. To this day nothing
will ever persuade the buxom mother of
farmer Wurzel's fine young family that her
William was not actually audacious enough to
propose to Miss Lucy Warrender, and that his
attentions were favourably received. So often
has poor William Wurzel been twitted on
this matter that he has come to look upon
himself as a very Lothario, rescued at the right
moment.

In the drawing-room things went on much
as they always do in country drawing-rooms
in the hot weather. The girls sang ; Miss Hood,
their chaperon, played the inevitable Chopin ;

but (as, unlike zoophytes, chaperons cannot be
cut in two pieces, and yet live) Miss Hood felt
it her duty to leave Lucy, and to follow into
the verandah Haggard and his fiancee. Perhaps,
after all, this may have been rather a relief to
the lovers, for they had had a long innings
that day, no one having presumed to disturb
the numerous tetes-a-tete of the engaged couple.
Squire Warrender sat asleep in his chair,
his face covered by a big brown bandanna, so
that actually Spunyarn and Lucy were practically
alone. But the young lord didn't
attempt to renew his attentions to Lucy. In
his own mind Spunyarn perhaps felt that he
was well out of it. Lucy, a past-mistress in
the art of flirtation, was delicious as a friend ;
as a sweetheart there would have been two
sides to the question ; but Lucy Warrender asa
wife would have been simply appalling and
impossible. Lucy's bygone escapade with her
uncle's second footman  for failing high game,
Lucy Warrender was not above captivating
even a second footman  had been carefully

hushed up. ]t was the cause of the poor
young man's receiving a month's wages on the
spot and his dismissal. For Miss Hood had
detected him in passing a very pink-looking
letter to Lucy Warrender. Pinker far than
the letter were the face and ears of the guilty
domestic, as he placed the intercepted missive
in Miss Hood's hands, on her sternly ordering
him to do so. Of course the letter was shown
to Mr. Warrender ; he was very angry under
the circumstances. But the letter of the unfortunate
Joseph, though it had caused him
many agonies in its composition, was comic in
the extreme. It was full of what the writer
called " pottery ;" it was the poor young
fellow's first love letter. Alas, it was a mere
answer to a letter of Lucy's; she had commenced
the correspondence ; it was she who had thrown
the handkerchief.

Needless to say Lucy was deported at once,
and Madame Planchette's, nee Jones, finishing
establishment in the Champs Elysees received
a fresh pupil. Lucy's minauderies could now

only be practised on her own sex. But even
there the girl succeeded in setting the whole
house by the ears ; and causing the sudden
dismissal of the Italian professor, a gifted Pied-montes,
with a gigantic head of black curly
hair and long but dirty nails. At the end of
a year she returned to her uncle's roof, having
achieved an intimate acquaintance with French
argot; her accent, however, was undeniable.
Miss Warrender, too, now added to her already
dangerous fascinations the charms of a French
manner and a Parisian accent. But her persistent
secret studies of the works of Flaubert,
Zola and Co. probably had not improved her
mind. As soon as Miss Boot left the room,
Lucy seized the opportunity, on finding herself
thus practically alone with Lord Spun-yarn,
to give him a rather florid rendering
of " Best dans le nez que qa me chatouille"
in which she out-herded Herod, and was even
more piquante and suggestive than Madame
Beaumont herself. However, it did Spunyarn
at all events no harm, French being; a sealed

book to him. The strains of the syren at last
woke her uncle, and brought back Miss
Hood, who suggested that it was late. And
the party broke up at last at her instigation.

THE VILLAGE DORCAS.

The big room at King's Warren Parsonage was
already fairly well filled. Old Mrs. Wurzel
and the buxom but not too well-favoured
heiress of the house of Grains were at the
head of the table. Old Mrs. Wurzel was a
personage in her way ; she it was who made
the annual contract with the local linen-draper
; she it was who, as an adept learned
in the art, officiated at the awful ceremony of
cutting-out " ; she it was who, with infinite
trouble, obtained for the school children
those antiquated straw bonnets of a forgotten
type, which were the despair of the juvenile
village beauties. She herself had worn them
in her youth, and they were the proper bonnets
for " growing girls." But, alas ! Nemesis
had arrived ; the head coverings worn in

country places thirty years ago had become
once more the fashion, and the little maids
from school had been voted by Spunyarn
quite smart people." It was Mrs. Wurzel
who with her own fair but energetic hands
had, with her famous cutting-out scissors,
shorn away the luxuriant but obnoxious
fringe which Jemima Ann Blogg, the poacher's
daughter, had appeared in at the Confirmation.
Jemima Ann had violently resisted, but her
struggles were in vain ; in this case the sheep
had not been dumb when in the hands of
the shearer : the daughter of the village
Radical had returned to her father's roof
weeping, but shorn. It is true that old Mrs.
Wurzel had reluctantly paid to Blogg the
sum of five pounds, under the threat of a
summons for assault, but the honest fellow r
had honourably kept her secret as he had
promised, and Mrs. Wurzel's reputation, as
the champion of virtue and respectability,
had in no way suffered, though she had paid
her five pounds for it.

The vicar's wife, whose principal characteristics
were her interest in missionary work
and the sapience of her angles, was a mere
priestess in the little circle of which old Mrs.
Wurzel was the permanent archduchess.
Vicars' wives had come and gone, but all had
submitted, some after a brief struggle, to old
Airs. WurzeTs sway. But Mrs. Dodd, the
present vicar's wife, retained the precious
prerogative of choosing the book to be read
at the monthly Dorcas. Mrs. Dodd's choice
was invariably the biography of some missionary
; and she did her best to carry out the
idea that a Dorcas meeting should provide
self-mortification for the ladies present, in
the shape of coarse work for the fingers and
repellent reading for the mind.

The village Dorcas was that happy neutral
ground where the various ranks of society
met on an equality. Here might be seen
the three good-looking and well-educated
daughters of the local draper. Nice girls
these, but under the baleful shadow, the

bitter blight of trade. For country places
are very conservative : the squire looks down
on the yeoman, the doctor and the lawyer, all
three of whom consider themselves considerably
taller in social stature than the tenant
farmer, who in his turn will eat no bread and
drink no water in the houses of those Kecha-
bites, the tradesmen. All these people, however,
join in despising the rich stockbroker
who has recently purchased the pretentious
place which he calls " The Park ; " the gates
of which are almost celestial, being of bright
gilded iron work. The unfortunate inhabitant
of "The Park," notwithstanding his
well-appointed barouche and his men in
livery, is but a pariah. For not a year ago,
till the big corner occurred in Mex. Earls
in which he made his pile, little Sleek, of
Sleek and Dabbler, of Throgmorton Street,
had " been to business " every morning.
Sleek now passes his time in good works,
he takes a great interest in local affairs, and,
unless he flings the whole matter up in a

rage, he may yet become a justice of the
peace. Sleek finds it far harder work than
fortune-making ; but he pursues his 
with untiring energy. So do we
all. It is for this, that Sleek contributes
so liberally to the local charities. It is for
this, that the two Misses Sleek, clad in shining
raiment of needlework, are seated at the big
table, pursuing the unromantic occupation
of hemming huckaback towels of a more
than Spartan coarseness. But something has
been already gained by the monthly martyrdom
; Mrs. Dodd and her sister-in-law the
ethereal Anastatia address them as " dear,"
and they have a bowing acquaintance, which
they energetically attempt to increase, with
the Misses Warrender.

Within this charmed circle the veterinary
surgeon's womankind and the grocer's daughters
also dare to tread, but they are there
merely on sufferance. The line must be
drawn somewhere, and the vicar's wife, as

did her predecessor, drew it at that man of
vol. i. 4

blood, the harmless Rubble, the local butcher.
He and the rest of those shut out from Paradise
sought their enjoyment, and a perhaps
more congenial society, at those buttery
banquets, the tea meetings of the local Little
Bethel. Thus, as in most country places,
Dissent was at a premium among the humbler
classes, and possibly the continued assertion
of their position by the clergy of the State
has had a good deal to do with the spread
of Dissent in other villages than King's
Warren.

There were at least a dozen ladies seated
round the big table at the Parsonage. Our
friends Lucy and Georgina were among the
number, their simple muslins strikingly contrasting
with the more elaborate garments
of the Misses Sleek. Anastatia Dodd fluttered
(it is the only word) round the workers,
as they plied their busy needles; she "gave
out" the various garments, or portions thereof,
of mysterious shape ; and as she did so
whispered her little word of welcome, her

little chirrup of harmless gossip to each.
Mrs. Dodd who sat at the bottom of the
table as vice-chairmaness, now opened a
thick black book in which various markers
of coloured paper had been inserted. ' : I
think we are all here," she said, as she put
on her spectacles in a determine 1 manner,
and ominously cleared her throat. Nobody
disputed this proposition ; the hum of conversation
ceased.

I think we left off at the second appendix,
which contained letters from the wife of the
lamented subject of the biography. I will
now continue.

; Quashi-Bungo,
"july 21st, 18.

' ' Dearest Mary,

' I received your welcome
letter and the boxes of stores. Yoii
were quite right when you said that I seemed
to be launching out in the matter of outfit.
But I suddenly find myself (under Providence)
a means of civilization to the poor 



JJBRAf

nighted natives. These unfortunate heathen,
until our arrival, had no sense of propriety.
M'Bongo, the great chief of this neighbourhood,
paid a ceremonial visit to my husband.
Of course we understood that he would
wear the court costume of the Kukulokos.
I seized the opportunity to watch what I
supposed would be a most interesting interview,
from behind a curtain. Oh Mary,
what was my indignation when I saw the
nasty savage enter our dear little morning
room ! His great shock head of woolly hair
w T as dyed a bright yellow with quicklime,
in his ears were a pair of huge ear-rings
of massive gold that made my mouth w r ater.
(William told me afterwards that they were
worth at least fifty pounds). On his head
was the second-hand hat of some parvenu's
coachman, gold lace, cockade and all.
Fancy my horror, dear Mary, my terror,
indignation and astonishment, when I perceived
that the rest of his costume merely
consisted of a thick layer of palm oil, with

which the wretch had covered his disgusting
body. I saw no more ; I need not say I
fainted from the mingled effects of terror,
indignation, and astonishment. On coming
to, William told me that the courtiers, some
twenty in number, wore precisely the same
costume, minus the hat and ear-rings.

' Such, dear Mary, was the degraded
condition of M' Bongo and his court on our
arrival ; but it has been my happy lot
(under Providence) to change all this, and
my endeavours have not been without
even an earthly reward. Only think, Mary,
M'Bongo's ear-rings are now my own, my
very own. They will reach you by the
hands of Mr. Mckenzie, a worldly-minded
Scotch merchant, but honest as to earthly
things. On no account, dear Mary, in
disposing of these priceless treasures, have
anything to do with the jewellers, who I
am told are extremely dishonest persons.
You had better try to sell them to the
South Kensington Museum as curios, or at

some fashionable bazaar ; or failing these,
to some wealthy but unworldly person,
who takes an interest in our working in
Africa. Do not forget to mention that
they are royal ear-rings.' "

Here one of the Miss Seeks coughed,
but the broad grin on her face subsided
instantly under the severe look which Mrs.
Dodd gave her over her spectacles. After
a short pause and a snort of indignation,
the vicar's wife continued :

' I have been the blessed instrument,
dear Mary, of a great work in this
county. M'Bongo and his whole court are
now clothed, I am happy to say, at least
to a certain extent. The greater portion
of the royal garments have been obtained
from me ; unfortunately I have been compelled
to take payment in cattle and grain.
You remember my scarlet rep underskirt,
the one I wore so much during our last
winter in dear old England ; with a little
alteration at the waist, to which I have

added a green velvet collar, and an additional
placket hole (through which the
royal arms are thrust), and wearing my
galoshes, M'Bono attended service here
yesterday for the first time. Both garment
and galoshes were quite useless to me in
this hot country. William was unable to
persuade him to remove the cockaded hat.
which he, in his benighted way, looks upon
as a royal crown ; but as my husband's is
the only other hat in the country, this
does not perhaps much matter. William
has thus been happily able to report to
the society the approaching conversion of
M'Bongo and his imminent civilization.
The poor king, however, complains much
of the heat, and I am sorry to say only
wears these robes on ceremonial occasions.
Still it has been a great, great comfort tous
both.

' Yours lovingly,

' Amelia Eyes.'

Many such interesting letters were received
from our self-sacrificing countrywoman
up to the death of her husband
and fellow-worker. The sad end of the
mission to King M'Bongo has been narrated
in the body of this work. But Mrs. Eyes
was loth to leave her sphere in Africa,
and is now happily married to Alonzo P.
Jones, an energetic coloured Baptist minister,
of Cape Coast Castle."

There was a universal sigh of relief.

''I wonder whether she wears the earrings
? " remarked the elder Miss Sleek
pertly.

i5 Perhaps they were the attraction to
Alonzo P. Jones," suggested her sister, as
she triumphantly folded and smoothed her
second completed towel.

It's always the way with them,"
sighed Miss Grains, who suffered from a
complication of romantic tendency and very
tight stays. " It's the money that attracts
them, and possibly Mrs. Eyes might have

been Mrs. Eyes to the end of the chapter,
if it hadn't been for the ear-rings and the
sale of her old clothes for countless flocks
and herds."

Doubtless Miss Grains speaks from
painful experience, my dears'' retorted
Mrs. Dodd, with a severe look at her
victim ; " but you may be quite certain
that the acquisition of the ear-rings and
the sale of the clothes were but the
blessed means to an end, a mere spoiling
of the Egyptians, that the work might
progress."

In fact, a robbing of Peter to pay
Paul," suggested Lucy "Warrender, but without
raising her eves from her work.

The needle of the archduchess broke,
as she shook her head viciously at the
scoffer. " Ah, my dear, you shouldn't
laugh at sacred things," said the elder lady.

"But I don't look upon Mrs. Rees as a
sacred thing," cried Lucy, not to be intimidated.


c; A person no one would wish to know,"
chimed in Miss Sleek.

Ah, but think how she loved the
blacks, and gave herself up to them,"
cooed the vicars, in a tone intended at
the same time to convey instruction and
reproof.

Nasty thing," retorted Lucy, with biting
sarcasm. " I suppose it was because she
loved the blacks and gave herself up to
them, that she married the energetic negro
ranter with, the dreadful name."

This proved too much for Mrs. Dodd.
I am surprised and ashamed, Lucy War-render,
at your attempt to depreciate the
noble self-immolation of dear Mrs. Jones.
Of course it is a great privilege to be
married to a clergyman, a very precious
privilege, but when he is a negro and a
Baptist  hum  I suppose I must say clergyman,
then a woman's life must be indeed
a martyrdom."

I suppose he beats her ? " asked one

of the draper's daughters of the experienced
]airs. Wurzel.

I sincerely trust he does," broke in
the irreverent Lucy.

Just at this moment the door was hurriedly
opened, and the Reverend John
Dodd entered the room. He was a stout
man, his principal characteristics being an
intense pleasure in ladies' society, and an
obliviousness of the fact that he was no
longer the pale slim young curate of earlier
days. A life of almost absolute inactivity,
which was forced upon him by his wife's
jealousy of the rest of the sex, had rendered
the muscular young Dodd of Oriel
a perfect Daniel Lambert. Little irreverent
boys from the village corners were in the
habit of shouting " Jumbo " at the poor
vicar. He was accustomed to pursue them,
but in vain ; a stern chase is proverbially
a long chase, and poor Mr. Dodd's futile
efforts to capture his persecutors had become
a bye word. But the Eeverend John

Dodd's weak point, the red rag to the bull,
the bee in his bonnet, was his devotion to
the fair sex. Handsome Jack Dodd, as he
had been once called, in his undergraduate
and curate days, had been accustomed
to find his attentions very highly
appreciated. The habit grew on him, lovesick
maidens sighed, and love-sick maidens
wept, but all in vain. Handsome Jack
Dodd, a very clerical butterfly, flitted from
flower to flower. His admiration was
freely, openly, ardently expressed for every
variety of female beauty. Was Jack Dodd
a flirt ? Not a bit of it ; he was merely
a fancier, just as there are pigeon fanciers
and poultry fanciers ; so Handsome Jack
Dodd was a fancier, an admirer, a worshipper
of the entire female sex : that is
to say, the select specimens of it. What
be could have seen in Canon Drivel's
daughter who can say? though, when he
married Cecilia Drivel, she was a well-known
light of London. She it was who,

in the severity of her classic and rather

imperial beauty, had posed to Malilstick,

Ea , for his well-known picture of Judith

with the head of Holofernes. Alas ! for

poor Jack Dodd, he had assisted at the

numerous sittings. He it was who had

had the honour of sitting (that is to say

lying prone on a bedstead of the period)

for the headless trunk of Holofernes. To

lie prone on a bedstead of any period,

and have nothing to do for two mortal

hours but gaze on the classic proportions

of any lady  for Mahlstick was a strict

disciplinarian and discouraged conversation 

is enough to seal the fate of any man,

even if he were of a less inflammable type

than Handsome Jack. Miss Drivel washer

father's only daughter, and ambitious ;

but four seasons, during which she was

much admired, but never once received a

serious offer, had warned the waning

beauty not to neglect her opportunities.

Miss Drivel was a lady of no imagination

and strong will ; the interest of her father,
a notorious pluralist, was very great :
Cecilia Drivel was determined to marry
Dodd. She did so, and her victim became
her obedient slave, and was duly inducted
to the fat living of King's Warren. In all
things Jack Dodd. as the weaker vessel,
yielded to his wife. He had but one
drawback in her eyes, he retained his passion,
his innocent passion, for the fair sex.
At the shrine of beauty he remained a
constant and ecstatic worshipper. This was
Mrs. Dodd's cross, and she had to bear it.
An idle life at King's Warren Parsonage,
and frequent dinner parties, for the Reverend
John Dodd was a popular man, had
caused Handsome Jack to expand into a
very Falstaff. Alas, anxiety had had precisely
the reverse effect upon the vicar's
wife. The once statuesque "Judith" had
disappeared, and Mrs. Dodd's characteristics
were now high principle and bone.

"Busy as usual, my dear," said the vicar

to his wife, as he proceeded to welcome
each member of the female bevy in turn,
devoting perhaps a little more time than
was necessary to handsome Miss Warrender
and her cousin.

Mrs. Dodd closed the thick black book
with a slap. k ' I suppose work is over
now for the day ; you really should not
intrude on our Dorcas, John' she said
in a severe tone.

My dear, it is my duty to encourage
my parishioners in good works, nay. it is
my pleasure," replied the parson.

"No one doubts it, Mr. Dodd'" said the
vicars in an icy manner.

But Mrs. Dodd was evidently in a
minority. The ladies crowded round their
popular vicar. It is easy to spoil a man,
and the Eeverend John Dodd had been
much spoilt by his parishioners, and
seemed to like the process-and

now a whispered conference took
place between the Misses Sleek. With

smiles and conscious blushes, the elder
sister addressed the vicar. "Oh, dear Mr.
Dodd, we do so want you to do us a
favour," she faltered.

"Granted, my dear young lady, granted
before it is asked."

Mrs. Dodd vainly sought to fix her
husband with a freezing look, and gazed
appealingly at old Mrs. Wurzel, but that
experienced matron had been present at
many similar scenes, and was rather
amused than otherwise, to watch the discomfiture
of the vicar's imperious wife.
Mrs. Wurzel's eagle eye detected the little
parcel which the younger Miss Sleek
hesitatingly attempted to hold towards the
vicar. "It is our own work, dear Mr.
Dodd," she said, " and we hope, we do
hope, we do so hope that you will
accept them."

"And wear them too," chimed in her
sister.

In an elaborate box, from which Miss

Sleek rapidly tore the paper in which it
was wrapped, and hurriedly opened, lay
a dozen bands of the latest ecclesiastical
fashion.

Oh ladies, dear ladies, so you equip
your faithful knight for the fray ; accept
my grateful thanks, my very grateful
thanks," sighed the vicar.

So pleased you like them, dear Air.
Dodd," chorused the stockbroker's daughters.

The triumphs of decorative millinery
were passed from hand to hand.

They never made these," muttered
old Mrs. Wurzel to herself, as she critically
held one up to the light. " The
minxes," she inwardly added. Mrs. Wurzel
was quite right ; they had been supplied,
regardless of cost, from Messrs. Eochet and
Stole's well-known establishment.

Ah," purred Lucy Warrender, " the

ladies used to arm their knights with their

own fair hands in the days of chivalry."

The parson laughed. " And have the
vol. i. 5

days of chivalry departed, ladies?" he said,
protruding his head, much as the unconscious
aldermanic turtle is said to protrude
his, when awaiting the fatal stroke.

Bonny Sleek, the younger and bolder of
the two, looked at her sister ; the elder
girl nodded maliciously.

Bonny stepped smilingly forward, and
proceeded to affix the band around the
vicar's massive throat.

Fat Jack Dodd was in his glory ;
Jumbo " was in the seventh heaven of
bliss. A smile of beatitude spread over
his enormous countenance during the process.
But it suddenly disappeared, as a
sharp slam of the door announced the
sudden departure of his indignant wife,
the outraged Cecilia, Will it ever dawn
on Mrs. Dodd's mind, that parsons, even
married parsons, are but men?

WALLS END CASTLE.

Walls End Castle was the seat of John,

Earl of Pit Town. It had come into the

family through the marriage of a former

earl with the heiress of the great Chud-

leigh family. It was one of England's show

places. The great park which surrounded

it was one of the most celebrated in

all England, celebrated alike for its size and

its beauty. The entry to the park was

never denied to artists ; and they, their

easels, and their umbrellas, might be seen

at the various well-known " bits " all

through the summer and autumn. The

boys of the Elizabethan Grammar School

had also the privilege of roaming in the

park ; and time had been when the people

of the neighbouring town and the public

52

generally were admitted ; but excursionists
had arrived in crowds, they had destroyed
the poetry of the place with pieces of
greasy newspaper, broken bottles, ham bones,
and the remains of their Homeric banquets.
They had shouted and whistled in the
great picture galleries, they had written
their names upon the window panes, they
had committed all the innumerable offences
that such people do commit ; but the final
straw which determined the present earl
to exclude them, was their having played
at the game of Kiss-in-the-ring, one Whit-monday,
directly under the windows of the
noble owner. After that memorable day,
Lord Pit Town kept his castle and his
park to himself.

His lordship during the earlier part of
his reign never came near Walls End
Castle. The widowed earl travelled continuously
in Southern Europe. He travelled,
and he collected pictures, statuary, gems,
plate, china  nothing came amiss to him

But John, Earl of Pit Town, was wise in
his generation ; he remembered that " if
you sup with the devil, it is best to use
a long spoon." He never purchased without
an expsrli's aid ; consequently the
immense collection he had gradually accumulated
was free from rubbish. Nothing
doubtful or " reputed " ever arrived in the
huge packing-cases consigned to Walls End
Castle. For years his lordship was seldom
seen in London, the great house in Grosvenor
Square was never opened. When
Lord Pit Town was in England, he stayed
at Long's Hotel. Friends he had none ; his
doctor and his courier were the people
who saw most of him. But as years
rolled on his lordship grew tired of travel,
his well-known figure, in the short blue
cloak anl velvet collar, was seen no more
in the great picture galleries of Europe.
Lord Pit Town now commenced the work of
his life, the building of the new galleries
at Walls End Castle. Winter and summer

the little old man, for hee was over sixty
now, might be seen in the blue cloak,
inspecting the growth of the vast galleries
with a critical eye. Melius Wolff, his
German architect, was his constant companion.
The great Mr. Buskin paid him a
yearly visit ; on these occasions Dr. Wolff
(for Wolff was a doctor of philosophy)
joined his lordship and the great art-critic
at dinner. At length the great Pit
Town collection was housed as it deserved
to be. Its principal feature was the picture
gallery. This was a vast building of classical
design, resembling a Grecian temple.
Dr. Wolff was a Berliner, and the tradition
of Berlin is that a picture gallery should
resemble a Greek temple. The vast
galleries were probably among the best in
Europe. They were lighted and heated to
perfection. But the great galleries had
one peculiarity ; at irregular intervals along
the wall were blank spaces of varying size ;
in the centre of each space was a label

in his lordship's own writing : on these
labels were inscribed the names of various
great painters. It was now the only business
of the Earl of Pit Town to gradually
fill these spaces, each with a representative
masterpiece of the artist indicated. Possibly
John, Earl of Pit Town, notwithstanding
his boundless wealth, could hardly hope
to complete such a work in his own lifetime.
The great Mr. Abrahamss had an
unlimited commission to secure at any
price, a long list of great works. There
was but one condition attached, any purchase
must be above suspicion. But even
the great Mr. Abrahamss, on one notable
occasion at least, had been deceived. A
new acquisition, purchased from the collection
of a wealthy amateur in the
Eue Drouot, had arrived at Walls End
Castle. A furious controversy concerning
this picture had arisen among art critics.
Herr Yandenbossche had defended the
authenticity of the work, but old Mr.

Creeps had demolished him in an exhaustive
article in the Friday Review. Old
Mr. Creeps was considerably astonished at
receiving an almost affectionate letter from
Lord Pit Town. His lordship thanked him
for the article, and requested what lie
termed " the exceeding great pleasure of
receiving you here ;" the letter was dated
from Walls End Castle. Old Mr. Creeps
accepted the invitation for a couple of
days. On his arrival at the local railway
station he was met by his lordship in
person. Lord Pit Town, one of the
proudest and most exclusive of men, treated
old Mr. Creeps with marked deference. At
dinner, at which John Buskin and Dr. Wolff
were present, conversation ran purely upon
art matters. Old Mr. Creeps, the critic, had
never enjoyed himself so much ; the sitting
was prolonged till the small hours. Next
day, at noon, the council of four sat in solemn
conclave upon Lord Pit Town's latest
purchase. Old Mr. Creeps triumphantly

proved his case. Lord Pit Town looked
at Mr. Buskin. Mr. Buskin nodded.
Well, Wolff? " remarked his lordship.

It is unhappy, most unhappy," replied
the doctor of philosophy, " but I fear it is
drue, too drue."

What wall your lordship do with it ? "
said old Mr. Creeps.

"You shall see," replied that eminent
collector with a smile, as he advanced to
the easel on which the doubtful picture
stood. His lordship opened his penknife,
carefully and quietly he cut the canvas out
of the frame, he folded it in half : again lie
cut it, as though he w r ere cutting up a sheet
of brown paper ; he repeated the process
several times, then, handing the pieces to
the German, he merely remarked, " Oblige
me by burning these, Wolff."

They shall make a famous blaze," said
the philosopher, as he left the room to carry
out the sentence.

Would that all collectors could afford todo

the same, Lord Pit Town," remarked John
Buskin with a sigh.

Your lordship has done a noble act,"
cheerfully cried old Mr. Creeps, as he rubbed
his hands. " Of course you will trounce
Abrahamss. When the artistic world hears
of this morning's work, Lord Pit Town, it
will know what it owes to England's most
distinguished amateur."

No, no, Mr. Creeps. I must ask you to
keep this business a secret ; no cheap popularity
for me," replied the old lord.

Cheap ! " echoed the critic, as he raised
his eyes to the skylight. "Good heavens!
he calls it cheap," whispered the old man to
John Buskin.

His lordship is right," was the oracle's
oracular reply.

Men said that Lord Pit Town was eccentric.
Gossips said that he was mad. Perhaps
after all he was only honest according
to his lights. Next day the handsome
frame, carefully packed, was returned to Mr.

Abrahamss ; it was duly deducted from his
account. But he got his cheque for the
price of the picture, and his very liberal
commission.

In vain did the artists who frequented
Walls End Park attempt to stalk the old
nobleman in his lonely walks. They never
succeeded in selling him a picture from the
easel. " Capital, capital," his lordship would
remark with great alacrity, when there was
no other way of escape. The eldest Miss
Solomonson, the most talented member of
that clever Hebrew family  she is great at
animals  tried to shoot the wary old lord
with her well-known picture of " The Timid
Fawn," but she ignominiously failed.

The old wretch called me ' my dear,' and
said he liked my sky, when I hadn't even
indicated the sky," she indignantly remarked
to her amused father.

Miss Solomonson's masses of jetty hair, and
the fire from the glances of her oriental eyes,
were said to have melted the stony hearts

even of dealers who were her co-religionists.
But with all her advantages Miss Solomon son
failed with the old lord, and she abuses him
to this da 7 . She had her revenge, however,
for in her well-known Academy picture of
the following year, " Balaam and his Ass,"
the angel was represented by a glorified portrait
of Miss Solomonson herself, who glared
down in an indignant manner upon the terrified
and kneeling Balaam. Old Mr. Creeps
and the other art-critics chuckled as they
recognized the angelic portrait ; but the r
chuckled still more, when they saw that the
terrified Balaam was but an ill-natured caricature
of John, Earl of Pit Town.

I'd have done him as the ass, you know,
only he was too ugly. I hope he'll like the
figures better than the sky this time,"
snorted the indignant Hebrew maiden.

The curse of the Earl of Pit Town's life
was the so-called gallery of old masters in
Walls End Castle. He couldn't sell them ;
he couldn't burn them ; he was even compelled

to insure them, to his intense disgust.
For when a former lord had inherited Walls
End Castle from the Chudleighs, old masters
had been the fashion ; and the purchaser,
delighted with his toy, had made the pictures
heirlooms. But the present lord had shut
up what to him was a mere chamber of
horrors. He and Dr. Wolff had actually
composed a catalogue raisonne of the entire
collection, in which the fictitious nature of
the claims to respect of each monstrous daub
was triumphantly demonstrated. The sprawling
Expenses were shown to be but inferior
copies, the Paul Veronese was proved a
transparent sham, while the great Yandyck,
representing the Martyr-King seated on a
gigantic grey horse, was demonstrated to be
but a wretched replica of a miserable original.
There they hung, the old Pit Town heirlooms,
grimy with dirt ; for as the old lord used to
say, " To have cleaned them would have
been only to make their natural hideousness
still more apparent." Each picture bore a

label, giving a true description of the once-honoured
gem. Alas ! these veracious tablets
cruelly contrasted with the flourishes of the
old housekeeper's descriptions.

Two only of his heirlooms had stood the
crucial inspections of Lord Pit Town and
his experts. These were the great Raphael,
and the celebrated portrait of Barbara Chud-
leigh, the well-known beauty of Charles the
Second's time, by Sir Peter Lely. Wicked
Bab Chudleigh, as a wood nymph, simpered
upon the walls of the new gallery in which
the Chudleigh Raphael occupied the post of
honour.

We have seen what manner of man John,
Earl of Pit Town, was. We have seen how
his heirlooms troubled him not a little. We
have seen how he passed his life with the
faithful Wolff at Walls End Castle, patiently
waiting to fill the numerous blanks on the
walls of the new galleries } in fact to accomplish
his destiny. For if ever there was a
born collector, a real collector, to whom the

actual intrinsic value of a painting was absolutely
of no importance, it was John, Earl
of Pit Town. And this indifference to the
value at the hammer of their acquisitions,
marks the distinction between the genuine
collector or connoisseur and the ruck of the
people who buy pictures ; the bulk of whom
are after all but amateur dealers. When the
successful stock-jobber leaves off dealing in
shares and takes to art, he merely deals in
another more or less intangible security of
very fluctuating value. With childlike confidence
he follows the advice of some more or
less honest dealer. He buys from the easel
with a hope of a " rapid rise." Works are
knocked down to him at Christie's simply
because they are apparently cheap, and he is
carrying out the old axiom of his trade,
always buy rubbish." In the same way he
is perpetually buying and selling pictures
upon the time honoured maxim of Capet
Court, "nail your profit, and cut your loss."
He will even go so for as to develop a taste

for a particular master in the hope that
he may succeed ultimately in making a
corner " in that special security. And
the sole dream of such a man is the result
in pounds, shillings and pence of the auction
that will inevitably take place at his death.
The possession of a certain number of
valuable works of art confers an amount
of distinction upon their proprietor, and
Brown, who as Brown is a nobody, becomes
a somebody as the owner of the Brown collection.
Of this fact Manchester " men " and
Liverpool " gentlemen " are well aware. But,
as has been seen, a deep gulf divided these
amateur dealers from John, Earl of Pit
Town.

The old earl's property, the source of his
wealth, as from his title the reader will have
shrewdly guessed, w T as in collieries. With
the management of these, however, the Earl
of Pit Town did not trouble himself. His
various agents paid yearly increasing sums
into that aristocratic bank in the Strand,

which never allows interest on deposits,
which never advises any investment except
Consols, and whose clerks from time immemorial
have worn white chokers.

For many years it had been the old lord's
habit to entertain those members of his
family, never exceeding four in number,
who were nearest to the title. Twice a
year the formal invitation was sent out by
the old nobleman to his only son, and to
his two nephews. Once in the height of the
summer and once at Christmas these invitations
were issued. They were never refused,
for their recipients looked upon them much
in the light of a royal command.

Lord Hetton, the earl's only son, and his*

heir, was always one of the guests on these

occasions ; to him it was an exceedingly

unpleasant time ; for father and son had

quarrelled years ago, the old lord having

sternly declined to increase his son's very

liberal allowance of five thousand a year,

A man can do a great deal on five thousand
vol. i. 6

a year, but not much is left for the annuitant
when he is possessed by the idea that,
some day or other, it will be his good
fortune to win the Derby. In all other
things but race-horses, Hetton was a man
of frugal mind. For the sake of his
stud he had remained a bachelor ; for he
felt that were he to marry, yet another
obstacle would be raised to the attainment
of his ambition. Ever since his majority
Lord Hetton had annually entered a coltin
the great race. His nominations had on
two occasions even run into places. Four
years ago Helton's horse had been first
favourite, but it was ignominiously beaten.
Tins very year, that rank outsider, Dark
Despair, who, starting at sixty to one, had
just been beaten on the post, was the property
of his persevering, but unlucky, lordship.
Twice a year did Lord Hetton present
himself at Walls End Castle. He used to
walk through the park, and note with
pleasure the care that his father bestowed

on the gigantic property. It pleased him
to see how well kept was everything about
the place. It gratified him to find his
opinions deferentially listened to by the
steward, and to perceive that year by year
the family solicitors treated him with a still
greater obsequiousness. But in his heart, he
cursed what he called his father's folly, ashe
looked at the new galleries ; and he
would have liked to stamp and swear, as
at every visit he dutifully admired each
new and costly acquisition of the old earl's,
lie would walk discontentedly up and down
the old picture gallery where hung the
worthless heirlooms that, in the ordinary
course of nature, must one day be his own :
and he wondered whether he should ever
possess the Golconda contained in the new
galleries. Perhaps it was only human nature
that caused him to watch, and watch in vain,
for any apparent sign of increasing infirmity
in the old earl. But he never quarrelled
with his father, for on the morning of his

G 2

departure from the paternal roof, he was
accustomed to receive a very considerable
solatium to his wounded feelings, in the
shape of a heavy cheque on the bank in
the Strand. The amount of this cheque was
invariable ; it kept Hetton on his good behaviour,
and he had learned to look upon
it as part of his allowance. On one memorable
occasion he had presumed to remonstrate
with his father on the enormous cost of his
last artistic acquisitions ; the earl had merely
shrugged his shoulders. That visit had been
indignantly remembered by Lord Hetton, for
when the venerable connoisseur bade his
lordship good-bye, there had been no cheque,
though there was no change in his lordship's
manner towards his son.

Mr. Haggard, of the Home Office, a 
gentleman, whose principal
characteristic was his brilliant whist, which
it was said brought him in a certain but
variable income, was the next heir in direct
succession ; he was the nephew of his lordship,

and a childless bachelor. His presence,
also, always graced Walls End Castle at the
regulation periods.

Mr. John Haggard, of Ash Priory, the
father of big Reginald, was always the third
guest. John Haggard, the second nephew
of Lord Pit Town, was a J. P. for his county,
of the Shakespearian type. He was fond of
good living, his eye was severe, and his
beard of sober cut. He embodied the law,
in his own immediate neighbourhood, to the
intense terror of local delinquents. He had
meted out stern justice to his own son, when
he had banished bii Reginald to South
America ; but he had his virtues. He lived
within his means, he entertained his neighbours
at rather heavy dinners, he gave ibis
wife and daughters a fortnight in town
during the season, and he habitually took
the first prize at the county show for black
pigs. He never forgot that he was third in
succession to the title. He never doubted
his capacity, should he ever be called to

occupy the position of a hereditary legislator
; and now that his son had returned
a considerably wealthier man than he himself
was, he chuckled, when in his mind's
eye he thought of him as some day bearing
the courtesy title of Lord He t ton.

The earl and the doctor of philosophy
sat at breakfast in a little oak wainscoted
room whose windows commanded a full view
of the new galleries. In this little room
the galleries had been designed ; the windows
had looked upon the commencement of the
great work. An army of navvies had dug
out the earth for the gigantic foundations.
Then arose a very forest of scaffold-poles.
Two huge steam engines had snorted and
puffed for three whole years. A colossal
steam " traveller " had ceaselessly carried
great blocks of stone and long steel girders
from point to point. The clink of the stone-masons'
chisels had resounded year after
year from morning till night. Then came
the carpenters, and the noise of their busy

hammers had been deafening. When not
actually on the works, Lord Pit Town had
viewed them from the window of his
favourite room. But scaffold poles, steam
engines and labourers had disappeared ;
the rubbish had been cleared away, and the
huge white block stood out in the clear
air : dominating the rev weather-stained
gables of Walls End Castle much as Aladdin's
palace is said to have dominated the
more ancient but less magnificent residence
of his father-in-law the Emperor of China.
There was an air of spick and-meanness about
the whole thins that annoyed the earl. The

o 

new galleries had been finished four whole
years, but they still looked painfully fresh.

I hear that I am to have the pleasure of
welcoming another of your lordship's relatives
this year," said the doctor of philosophy
to the earl.

Yes ; Wolff ' where the carcase is there
shall the eagles be gathered together.' I
have kept them waiting for some years, and

I don't feel a bit like dying, Wolff. Though
I confess I dread Hetton's critical examination.
He always looks me over in his stud-groom
sort of way. But I suppose, as he
is my nearest relative, it is but natural he
should be anxious about my health. As for
the young fellow, I have never even seen
him. My nephew wished to bring him, and
he is about to marry. In fact he and his
father will be the only married men among
my direct heirs."

"And does the young man love art?"
No. I think his talents are confined to
spending money and getting into trouble.
But my nephew tells me that he is now
going to forswear sack and live cleanly."

That is what I cannot understand, my
lord. I had a cold the other day, a most
severe cold. I tell the young man to bring
me a cup of sack ; he sends to me the butler.
I say to him, ' Give me the sack.' lie
replied to me, ' I cannot do that, sir, it's
only his lordship can do that.' What is,

then, this precious drink I read of in my
Shakespeare  so precious, that your lordship
will not trust him to his butler ? And
now you tell me that your nephew will
drink him no more. I never see your lordship
drink him. Has, then, your lordship
forsworn him too ? "

His lordship laughed as he finished his
coffee. fct Xo one drinks sack now-a-days,
Wolff, and the quotation was merely figurative
; while the other sack the butler talked
about was but a vulgarism used by his class.
You will never get that either, in my lifetime
at least."

1 understand it not. But your grands
the young man, it pleases you that
he shall marry ?"

"It is indifferent to me, Wolff; if I can
only live to fill the vacant wall spaces in
the new galleries, I can seriously say, acres
moi le tune . But here comes the first
arrival."

One of his lordship's close carriages was

coming up the great chestnut avenue ; Lord
Trenton was its sole occupant. As the old
butler received him in the hall, with the
deference due to his master's son, the
sporting nobleman laughingly commiserated
him.

We have neither of us any luck, Russell,
as usual," he said. " I thought I had a real
good thing this time. As usual, I put you on
for a fiver, Russell; as usual, it didn't come off."
Lord Hetton was of a frugal mind. He was
continually presenting innumerable imaginary
rivers to little people. He was always putting
them on for them at tremendous odds, but
the good things never came off, and the
recipients of his favours were never informed
of his munificence till after the event.

"I most humbly thank your lordship,"
replied the butler with an air of profound
gratitude, as he chuckled in his sleeve.

CD 1

For the old man too was of a sporting turn.
He knew all about Dark Despair, and
annually he had carefully laid the odds

against Lord Helton's nomination for the
great race.

The same rooms, I suppose, Russell ? *'
Always the same rooms, your lordship"'
Lord Hetton mechanically proceeded to
his quarters.

On joining the earl, father and son met
as if they had parted only the previous
day. The pursuits of neither interested the
other. Art and horse-flesh were subjects
tabooed by mutual consent. A desultory
conversation on politics, in which neither
took the slightest interest, was a safe neutral
ground. It was with a feeling of relief on
both sides that the arrival of Mr. Haggard,
of the Home Office, was announced. His
lordship retired shortly to his study, Hetton
and Mr. Haggard betook themselves to the

CO

billiard-room.

At dinner the family party was increased
by the presence of John Haggard and his
son, both of whom were well received by
the earl, who now saw his grand-nephew

for the first time. Bii? Besnnald's magnificent
physique made its due impression ;
his father was evidently proud of him, and
the old lord congratulated the young man
on his approaching marriage.

Eeginald Haggard was not diffident, he
truckled to no one. He frankly avowed to
his grand uncle that he knew nothing of
art. When his lordship retired early, as
was his custom, the other men adjourned
once more to the billiard-room. Br Kesrinald
took their lives at pool, and pocketed their
half-crowns in an easy genial way, which
almost made losing a pleasure.

During the fortnight in which Lord Pit
Town entertained his relatives, nothing
occurred to mar the harmony of the meeting.
During that fortnight Big Eeginald
got on friendly terms with everybody.

Nothing seemed to overawe or intimidate
the ingenuous youth. He saw with evident
pleasure the outward and visible signs of
the old earl's immense wealth. As he looked

round upon the priceless collection in the
new galleries, as he thought of the old
nobleman's huge estates, he remembered that
the investment that Mr. Hyam Hyams had
made in his own contingent post obits was
probably a good one ; he prudently determined
to pay off the Jew as soon as he
should realize his American properties. In
his own mind he determined already that,
should he ever be his great-uncle's successor,
he would distribute the great Pit Town
collection to the four winds of heaven. But
he made one mental reservation, as he stood
before Sir Peter Lely's masterpiece, and
gazed on the lovely features and roving
eye of "Wicked Bab Chudleigh : " "A
monstrous fine girl. Yes, I should stick
to her." If Reginald Haggard did come

O DO

into the estates after all, and did "stick to
her," she would be the first one of her sex
he had ever stuck to.

Walls End Castle, when the party broke
up, returned to its normal state. The earl

and the philosopher continued the even
tenour of their ways. Lord Hetton took
away his big cheque, which was duly
honoured at the old-fashioned bank in the
Strand. A cheque for a like amount had
been given to Reginald Haggard by the
earl. "Buy something for your wife that's
to-be," he said to his grand-nephew, ashe
handed him the folded paper. " War-render
was one of my friends years ago,
when I had friends," said the old nobleman
with a sigh " They are good old-fashioned
people the Warrenders, and honest. Don't
thank me," he said, as he shook hands with
the young fellow. "Of course you will
come here with your father in the winter.
I shall hope to see the new Mrs. Haggard
too," he added. " Good-bye. I shall send
you a formal invitation."

When big Reginald told his father of this
interview, as they were driving to the
station, Justice Hazard did not conceal his
satisfaction. "He will outlive all of us, my

boy, Hetton into the bargain. "Who knows
but you may be one day Earl of Pit Town ?
Keep in with the old man if you can. His
place, as you have seen, is perfect, all but
the piggeries. lie doesn't go in for pigs
though, he goes in for pictures  every man
to his taste. I prefer pigs."

AT THE PANDEMONIUM CLUB.

It was Wednesday night ; over forty men
sat down to the house-dinner at the Pandemonium
Club. As usual the dinner was
reciter cite, for the Pandemonium chef enjoyed
a world-wide reputation. It is to be feared
that the attractions of the house-dinner were
not the sole inducement to many of those
sitting there. A house-dinner always secured
a large party in the card-room afterwards,
and though, the Pandemonium was a celebrated
dining club, it was notoriously also
a gambling one. Though the Pandemonium
was a gambler's paradise, and many scandals
had occurred there, yet the dirty linen had
been always washed at home, and the exact
details of these affairs had never leaked out.
Young Spooner, of the Foreign Office, Sir

John Spooner's, the Warwickshire baronet,
eldest son, had certainly left London as
fourth secretary to the Teheran Embassy,
where he still remained ; while Rolls, a
briefless barrister, who was fond of backing
himself at the whist table, had taken his
name off the books, though he had honourably
paid his losses, and suddenly accepted
the not over-brilliant position of an 
on the Gold Coast : pay there
was high and promotion rapid, but no one
had ever been known to live lone enough
to take a pension.

Magnums of the driest and most expensive
champagne seemed to be the favourite beverage.
But the whispers as a rule drank claret,
in anticipation of the more serious business
that was sure to follow the weekly house-dinner.
Captains Spotstroke and Pool were
equally careful ; the rest of those present
drank freely. The elaborate dessert was
followed by a general move. Old Sir Peter

Growler and Canon Drivel, Dad., retired to
vol. i. 7

the smoke-room, where they retailed their
old, but exceedingly improper anecdotes, to
a select circle of the very youngest men.
In the billiard-room, pool at half sovereign
lives, was commenced, and promised to run
into the small hours  a sure harvest for
Captains Spotstroke and Pool. In confidence
it may be said that Spotstroke's little place
in the south of Ireland only existed in his
own imagination, his rents being entirely
derived from his skill with his cue, and the
certain income that he extracted from the
very safe little book that he made on most
of the great events of the year. A small contingent
of the members hurried off to applaud
the successful comic opera of the hour.

The card-room attracted its usual habitues,
these sat down to whist ; and if an unskilled
unfortunate joined the fatal tables, he soon
had reason to regret his temerity, round
points were habitually played at the Pandemonium,
and as the evening went on, though
the points never varied, betting among the

players and the " gallery " usually became
extremely heavy. Discussions never arose
at the whist tables of this rather fast club,
for the players had Cavendish and Pole at
their fingers' ends. General Pepper, Cab.,
had raised his eyes in unfeigned astonishment
and horror, when an old Worcestershire
baronet, his partner, once made a reference
to Hoyle, and professed himself unacquainted
with " the Peter." Needless to say, the
Worcestershire baronet had returned to his
ancestral acres a sadder but a wiser man.
He showed his wisdom in giving the Pandemonium
card-room a very wide berth for
the rest of his days. He subsequently had
the good sense to join the comic opera
division, and to finish his evenings with the
undeniable oysters, for which the Pandemonium
is so celebrated. Xo one was ever
seen at this well-known club after lunchtime
or before dinner, save a few miserable
veterans, to whom perpetual whist was a
necessity. The bulk of the servants even,

only commenced their daily duties at dusk,
while the steward never appeared till the
dinner hour ; but then he, poor man, had
to be to the fore all night, for it was a
stern rule in the card-room that I U's were
never seen, the play being always for ready
money, in notes and gold. Mr. Lesson,
the amiable steward (originally from Hamburg),
had a very Pactolus ready for the
accommodation, for a consideration, of his
numerous masters, in his iron safe. Lesson's
relations think he will cut up well at his
death ; Levison's relations are right.

It is one in the morning. Though it is
in the height of summer the Pandemonium
card-room is cool ; they burn wax candles
here, and gas is absolutely banished from
this particular chamber of the club, where
fortunes are sometimes lost and won. Inmost
club card-rooms smoking is not permitted,
but at the Pandemonium it is the
fashion to smoke everywhere. One whist
table only is at work ; General Pepper and

three old hands of the same kidney are
hard at it. The four old men rub their
blear old eyes at the conclusion of each
deal, and then pull down their faultless
cuffs over their eager and bony old hands.
The card table profitably occupies some six
to eight hours daily of these old fellows'
attention. There is not much harm in it
after all. Probably none of them are very
much the better or very much the worse at
the end of the year ; their sole ambition is
the saving of a game, particularly when
there is a good "gallery" to admire their
efforts. One dreaded Nemesis awaits these
men  the inevitable day when memory will
begin to fail, and they shall trump their
partner's best card. Or the still more
horrible apprehension of dimness of sight ;
for a pair of wicked old eyes will not last
for ever ; then the unhappy old player will
begin to revoke, and find himself perforce
relegated to " bumble-puppy," or to whiskey-ands
water and solemn slumbers in the smoke-room,

or, more horrible still, the prolonged
society of Sir Peter Growler and Canon
Drivel, Dad.

Eule XXXV. of the club states that
Cards, chess and billiards may be played.
The sum played for shall not exceed one
pound points ; no play is permitted after two
a.m." Eule XXXVI. says, "No game of
hazard shall on any account be played in
the club-house." Eule XXXVII. sternly
goes on to assert that " any deviation from
the last two rules shall be attended with
expulsion." Truly good and moral regulations.
But these Draconic laws are, unfortunately,
a dead letter. Nothing is said in
them about bets. As in all clubs, only
members enter the card-room ; and most of
the members come to "flutter," as they
term it, and to " flutter " heavily.

In the centre of the room is an oval
table ; some dozen men are sitting at it ; as
many more stand behind their chairs. Two
many-branched candelabra, holding wax

lights, brilliantly illuminate the game.
Young Lamb, who six months ago ran a
"tick" for "tuck" at Eton, and trembled
coram pcedagogo, sits, his eyes bloodshot, as,
with nails driven into his palms, he watches,
in an anguish of excitement, the movements
of the dealer. Young Lamb's big cigar has
been out long ago ; but he pulls hard at it,
wholly unaware of the fact. It is easy
enough to distinguish, among those who
smoke at least, the more innocent from the
habitual gamblers ; the cigars of these latter,
even at the most exciting crises, are steadily
smoked at a uniform rate, while the new
hand is continually taking a light, as often
blowing sudden vast clouds, or his cigar all
unknown to him goes out, as has been
described. Your young player, too, sits
with his feet tucked tightly under his
chair ; he never moves them, and consequently
suffers much from that hitherto
described disease  that awful pain across
the knees, which, for want of a better name,

may be called " gamblers' rheumatism."
Are you quite sure you have never suffered
from this rather common disorder, gentle
reader, at least, if you be of the male sex ?
Perhaps you may remember having occasionally
walked home through the rain,
utterly cleared out, without even the needful
silver for a cab, with a dry throat, and
finding out for the first time w 7 hat "gamblers'
rheumatism " really means. If so, it is to
be hoped that, wise man as you are, the
first attack of this disorder was also your
last. But at the Pandemonium matters never
went to the extremity of a member suffering
the degradation of having to walk home in
the rain. Was not kind Mr. Levison ever
to the fore, with his neat little rouleaux of
sovereigns, and his fat pocket-book full of
new and crisp bank-notes ? Levison, as he
sat at the little table in the corner, on
which were writing materials and many
packs of new cards, never refused a loan in
so many words. " I wouldn't go on if 1

were you, sir ; the luck's dead against you
to-night ; I wouldn't go on, indeed I
wouldn't." This was his invariable formula.
It meant that the astute Hebrew declined
to do business on any terms. Xo one ever
argued with Levison ; all understood that
this particular phrase was final. The unhappy
applicant was naturally obliged to
temporarily retire from the game, at all
events for that night. No man would have
been idiot enough to have asked a loan
from a fellow player ; that would have been
quite contrary to the unwritten code of
ethics of the Pandemonium Club : fathers
have flinty hearts, but no fathers are so
proverbially flinty hearted as the fathers of
the card-room.

Among the players were the usual club
habitues. They are much the same everywhere,
the only difference being their
clothes. The rivers at the Pandemonium,
in their faultless evening dress ; the <jom-
mieux at Monte Carlo, in their tall collars

and their shiny boots ; the Bohemians, in
their tobacco-scented and eccentric garments ;
or the thieves playing at sixpenny loo in
St. Like's  all these people are at heart the
same. But we must not class in this unclean
category Lord Spunyarn and his friend
Haggard, who were both playing at the big
table. Haggard merely played for the excitement,
and Spunyarn because it was a
lesser bore to play than to look on.

The game was baccarat.

The table is covered with a tightly-stretched
green cloth, which is divided by
yellow lines into fourteen spaces ; two larger
ones in the centre of the table are the
places of the banker and the croupier ;
twelve other spaces of a smaller size indicate
the seats of the rest of the players, or
"punters," as they are technically termed.
The table is full, as has been stated : a
bank has just been terminated, and the
banker retires, having lost the whole
amount of his bank. The croupier, who is,

of course, a professional  a bald Frenchman,
nominally one of the card-room waiters
looks round the table with the air of an
auctioneer. "Fifty pounds  seventy-five 
a hundred  two hundred  two hundred and
fifty three hundred ; thank you, sir. Mr.
Haggard takes the bank, gentlemen, at three
hundred pounds."

Haggard rises with a smile, seats himself
in the dealer's vacant place, opposite the
croupier ; he places in front of him a pile
of gold and notes. With the rapidity of one
of Messrs. Courts' young men, the French
croupier counts the money ; he arranges the
gold in little piles, and the notes in three
little heaps, placing a small paper-weight on
each heap. Then the croupier tears open
two packets of new cards, flinging the old
ones into a waste-paper basket at his side.
He invites various players to make the
cards ; this is done in rather a perfunctory
manner. With a sort of huge paper-knife
the Frenchman passes the cards to Haggard,

and as lie does so, remarks in a clear, but
mechanical voice : " Gentlemen, the bank is
opened for three hundred pounds." Haggard
takes the cards, and, dividing them into two
equal parts, rapidly shuffles them, by raising
a corner of each parcel simultaneously, and
letting the corners slip with a rapid " burr."
Evidently, from the dexterity and precision
with which this feat is accomplished, George
Warrender's affianced lover is no novice.
He hands the cards to his right-hand neighbour,
who carefully cuts them ; each player
puts forth his stake towards the middle of
the table, in front of the space allotted him.
These stakes are gold only as yet, and no
man's venture seems over five pounds.
Haggard takes up about a sixth part of
the cards. " Gentlemen," cries the croupier,
"the game is made." Haggard places a
card to the left, for that half of the table ;
another at his right, for the other half; a
third one he takes himself: he repeats the
process. The croupier slips the blade of

his huge paper-knife underneath the two
cards which are on either side of the dealer,
and deposits them, unexposed, with marvellous
adroitness, before the punter on either
side whose turn it is to play. Court cards
and tens count as nothing, the ace as one ;
should the player make either eight or
nine he invariably rests contented, and exhibits
it ; if below eight, he exercises his
fancy or discretion, and takes or refuses a
third card. Then Haggard turns up his
own hand, doing precisely the same. He
has drawn a knave and a six ; he takes
another card ; this turns out to be an ace.
I have seven," he says. The player to
his right holds eight, the player to his left
has only six  the right side wins, the left
side loses. In an instant the croupier, with
his huge paper-knife, sweeps up the cards,
and, with the rapidity of a conjuring trick,
he casts them into a wooden bowl in the
middle of the table ; then he rapidly sweeps
off all the stakes on one side of the table ;

with equal celerity lie places each man's
winnings before the players on the other
side. There are no quarrels, and no mistakes.
Everybody is terribly polite. And
so the game goes on.

Though the amount played for is serious,
a good deal of rather bald conversation and
chaff goes on. There is a considerable
amount of give and take. If any one has
lost his temper, as well as his money, he
takes good care not to show it ; to do so here
would be indeed bad form. Young Lamb
has already paid several visits to Mr. Levison's
little table. Haggard's deal goes on, no very
startling coup coming off, but it has been
a good bank as yet, for the pile in front of
Haggard has increased to nearly six hundred
pounds. Young Lamb having gnawed his
extinguished cigar till it somewhat resembles
a quid, and having consequently swallowed
a considerable amount of nicotine, flings it
away with a curse. As the last note of his
last loan from Levison is swept up by the

remorseless pelle (for so the gigantic paperknife
is technically termed), Lamb gives an
order to the waiter, and pays another visit
to the smiling little Jew. Their business is
rapidly transacted ; Lamb redeems some half-dozen
I U's which he had previously given
to the steward, hurriedly signs a formal-looking
instrument, which is duly witnessed, and
stuffs into his breast-pocket a big roll of
notes, which he does not even stop to count.
t; I do hope you'll be careful, sir," remarks
the steward to Lamb in an affectionate
whisper, and in the tone of an anxious
mother to her favourite child. Lamb returns
to his seat at the table ; he has lost eight
hundred pounds already, but the bulge
lump in his breast-pocket is another five
thousand pounds. The waiter places by his
side a small guerdon on which is a little
carafe of green Chartreuse and a liqueur-glass
; he also hands to the young fellow a
box of big full-flavoured cigars, of the brand
of Anselmo del Vale. Lamb fills his case.

and lights this the ne plus ultra of a soothing
weed.

Dutch courage, Sammy, my boy," remarked
Spunyarn, as he calmly helps himself
to one of the youth's cigars.

You'd be doing the same, Shirtings, if
you'd been hit at this beast of a game as I
have."

Shirtings " was the playful name bestowed
on the noble lord, in reference to
the well-known fact that the Spunyarn money
had been made in a Manchester cotton mill,
and with that money it was said that the
Spunyarn title had been paid for ; the first
gentleman in Europe not disdaining such
bargains. Lamb swallows a second glass of
his panacea. The real fact is that the boy
likes it because it is sweet, the after-taste
indistinctly resembling the distant memories
of the peppermint bell's-eyes of his early
youth. But green Chartreuse unhappily is
not innocent ; it is more than a spirit, it is a
powerful drug. Fired by this second draught,

his tired eyes already a ferrety red, his mouth
dry with the tobacco, the drink and the excitement,
Lamb in a rasping voice shouts,
Banco."

There is a sudden hush. The whist players,
who had finished for the evening, hurry to
the baccarat table ; the other players, some
of whom had already staked their money,
reluctantly withdraw their various amounts.
The croupier announces, intoning as does a
high-church curate, "There is seven hundred
and forty pounds in the bank, gentlemen."

Lamb with shaking fingers places the required
amount in front of him. Haggard,
the dealer, apparently unconcerned, continues
the game. There is a dead silence. Neither
dealer or punter take a third card. The
cards are turned. The dealer has an eight
and king, the punter a Hve and three. J. tie.
The perspiration stands on young Lamb's
face ; again his cigar goes out. The croupier
pushes the seven hundred and forty pounds
of the unlucky player a foot nearer to the

VOL. I. 8

bank. The next coup will decide the matter.
If Lamb wins, he will get his own money
back, if he loses, then his money is gone for
good. Again a dead silence, again the cards
are dealt; this time the bank wins ; there is
a loud noise of excited "talking, above which
rises the monotonous chant of the croupier,
-" There is fourteen hundred and eighty
pounds in the bank, gentlemen."

The wretched young man persistently exercises
his right of crying "Banco," and so
practically going double or quits each time.
But "the cards never forgive," and as a rule
Dame Fortune is relentless to the reckless
player. Three more coups are played, each
of which the banker, that is to say Haggard,
wins. At the end of the third coup, Lamb
loses, at a single blow, nearly three thousand
pounds ; he calls the steward to his side, a
short whispered conversation takes place.
"Five thousand nine hundred and twenty
pounds in the bank." Again the young fellow
repeats his fatal "Banco," as he stakes a

fresh pile of notes handed to him by the obsequious
Jew. Again he loses. Haggard has
won, of him alone, eleven thousand pounds.
Nobody feels inclined to go on ; every one is
rather scandalized, for it is apparent to all
that the boy has become suddenly, thoroughly
intoxicated.

Damned shame, I call it," growled old
General Pepper, who in his heart envied
Haggard his luck. " Why, the man's drunk,
beastly drunk, sir."

Haggard rises, glaring at old Pepper in a
menacing manner. "Am I to regard your
remark as any insinuation upon me, General
Pepper ? " he said fiercely.

I say it's a damned shame," repeated the
veteran.

The hubbub became general. What was
to be done ? Of course, there would be a
scandal, but in the eyes of most men at the
Pandemonium Club, Haggard was not to be
blamed, he was merely to be envied. Probably
the real fact was that the weak young

82

fellow was suddenly carried off his legs by
the repeated draughts of the fiery cordial,
the effect of which only became apparent to
the on-lookers after the final bet had been
made and the game had recommenced. Who
shall cast a stone, then, at Haggard ? He
merely backed his luck, as the saying is.
There was nothing unfair about the matter.
But the nasty part of the whole thing was,
that Haggard had won eleven thousand
pounds from a weak-headed boy. The
society newspapers for the week alluded to
the matter in veiled, but unmistakable terms.
And when Haggard announced to his friend
Spunyarn his intention of returning to
America, to realize his property, on the termination
of bis wedding tour, the young
lord acquiesced in that decision, casually
remarking, " It would be as well if you
fought shy a bit, you know, old man, for I
am heartily sick of being bothered about
the baccarat matter, and of looking in the
paper to see if that young prig Lamb has

hung himself. Ta ta, you lucky beggar. I
shall be to the fore at your diggings tomorrow,
in the regulation shiny boots."
They parted.

Next day Eeginald Haggard was to lead
Georgina Warrender to the altar, and Spun-yarn's
allusion to shiny boots merely referred
to the fact that he was to be his
friend Haggard's best man.

george's wedding.

In newspaper descriptions of the last moments
of celebrated criminals, we constantly
read that " the unfortunate man did full
justice to a substantial meal;" but nobody
ever yet heard of a bridegroom who had
any appetite for his breakfast ; his own real
breakfast is meant, and not the elaborate
entertainment which follows close upon the
ceremony. Eeginald Haggard and his friend,
Lord Spunyarn, were the vicar's guests at
King's Warren Parsonage, but in vain did
Mrs. Dodd press upon Haggard the numerous
dainties with which her hospitable board was
provided. Haggard was in a state of suppressed
excitement, and he couldn't eat a
mouthful. They were a cheerful enough
party though, and Lord Spunyarn made up

for his friend's deficiencies, for the young-nobleman
had an almost Homeric appetite.
Justice Haggard, Reginald's father, and
Lord Hetton, who had passed the night at the
Dun Cow," were present, for the sporting
nobleman was supposed to represent the
head of the family, his father, Lord Pit
Town ; and though he looked upon the
whole matter as a very great nuisance
indeed, still it was a family function at
which his presence was a matter of course.

That breakfast at the Parsonage seemed
interminable to Haggard, but even clerical
breakfasts must have an end, and at length
Mrs. Dodd rose, to the general relief of all
present. There were yet two mortal hours
to get through, and the men of the party
sought the cool shades of the vicarage
garden.

Pull yourself together, old man," said
Spunyarn to his friend, for Haggard was
looking pale and miserable ; " you're as
sulky as a bear with a sore head. It's

quite unnecessary to pose as a hero of
romance. What's up with you, man ; boots
too tight ? "

"I'll be hanged if I can tell you what's
up," said his friend, " but this I know, I'm
confoundedly depressed."

Perhaps it's your natural timidity," said
the other.

Don't chaff, Shirtings ; you're a very good
fellow, you know, but I'm not in a laughing
humour."

Well, you needn't sulk all the same,"
said Spunyarn ; " take my advice and have a
glass of brandy."

Justice Haggard looked far more like a
bridegroom than his son ; the old gentleman,
in his blue frock coat, his blue bird's-pye
neckerchief, and with a flower in his buttonhole,
was the picture of health and happiness
; while his white hat, which was cocked
a little on one side, completed his festal appearance.
He gave his son a hearty smack
on the back.

When I married your mother, Eeginald,
my boy, I was as jolly as a man could be ;
why, there's nothing to be alarmed about,
unless you've lost the ring, you know ; and
the ladies wouldn't let you off with that
excuse, for there's always the key of the
church door in case of an emergency."

Haggard forced a smile.

The ring's safe enough, father," lie
said.

Don't worry him, gentlemen," cried the
vicar ; " it's only natural. I've had a good
deal of experience with bridegrooms ; believe
me, it's the general symptom. T felt just
the same when I was married myself; but
it's nothing to preaching one's first sermon.
It's all very well for you to talk, Haggard ;
but I'll be bound we were both just as
miserable as our young friend, though we've
forgotten all about it now. But here comes
my wife with the sacrificial emblems."

There was no compromise about Mrs.
Dodd, as she advanced straight to the bridegroom

and proceeded to firmly secure a
large white favour to his breast. The rest
of the party were soon similarly decorated.

There's one comfort, we haven't far to
go," said Lord Hetton. " I feel we look
rather like a parcel of fools."

"At all events, we haven't any time to
lose," suggested the vicar, as he looked at
his watch ; " and, unless we mean to keep
the bride waiting, we had better be off."

The whole party passed through the little
wicket, crossed the churchyard, which was
thronged with the whole population of
King's Warren in its Sunday best, and
entered the church, and the bridegroom
and his friends at once took their place
at the altar rails.

If George Warrender had acted with
proper decorum, she would have wept
upon her father's bosom ; but this ill-regulated
young person did nothing of the kind.
They must have been all very glad to get
rid of her at The Warren, for nobody shed

a single tear ; there was a great deal of
running about ; the young person from the
West End milliner's, her mouth full of pins,
issued innumerable orders in a muffled
whisper ; and Miss Lucy Warrender and
her three fellow bridesmaids appeared completely
attired, at least half-a-dozen times,
to submit themselves to old Warrender's
inspection in the drawing-room quite half-an-hour
before the carriages drew up at
the door to take them to the church.

George was not sufficiently old-fashioned
to be married in a bonnet. Even a plain
girl looks well in white, and George was
not a plain girl by any means. Of course,
according to all proper precedent she ought
to have rushed into her father's arms, and
with floods of tears have bid him a touching
farewell. What she did do, however,
as she entered the room, was to rapidly
advance and affectionately embrace him,
then she stepped back and dropped him
a low courtesy.

Shall I do, papa ? " she said with a loving
smile.

My dear, you're a credit to all of us,"
said the old gentleman, and her appearance
certainly justified the ecstatic looks of Miss
Hood, the four bridesmaids, and the young
person from the West End.

George was fully conscious of her privileges.
No woman can twice in her life
dress in white satin and orange blossoms,
and if she mars the effect by the regulation
tears, it is quite certain that there
must be a screw loose somewhere. There
was a great deal of tittering, smiling, and
blushing ; but the squire glanced at the
clock, Lucy handed the bridal bouquet to
her cousin, then the squire gave his daughter
his arm, and, preceded by the bridesmaids,
the little procession entered the
carriages, and five minutes' drive brought
them to the church.

Haggard, when he cast his eyes upon
George War render, seemed to regain his

composure at once; there must have been
a terrible amount of forwardness about this
young lady, for according to rule and the
pictures in the illustrated papers, her eyes
should have been fixed upon the ground;
and as the latest etiquette book says, "the
bride should only acknowledge the bridegroom's
presence by an assumption of
shrinking timidity suitable to the occasion'
But the bride smiled at Haggard, and so did
the vicar, and so did the four bridesmaids.
The Reverend John Dodd didn't take long
in tying the knot. The village organist had
distinguished himself by his florid rendering
of the Wedding March. As Lord Spunyarn
gave his arm to Lucy Warrender, he almost
felt as if he had been married himself, and
that it was a rather pleasant process than
otherwise.

It's rather rough on us, Miss Warrender,
having to play second fiddle," he said, while
they were standing in the vestry during the
signing of the register.

Well, we can look upon it as a dress
rehearsal, Lord Spunyarn ; but we mustn't
forget that it is a solemn moment, for I
see that Mrs. Dodd is looking this way."

The bells were clashing merrily from the
village spire as the party passed out of the
church porch. As Haggard handed his wife
into the carriage, she appeared still lost to
all sense of the proprieties, for she nodded
and smiled in every direction at the King's
Warren villagers, among idiom she had
grown up ; even poor Blogg, the poacher,
and his hoyden daughter, Jemima Ann,
were not unnoticed. And the patriarchal
blessing of the village veteran, " Master "
Jasper, as he was called (who had represented
King's Warren on the field of
glory some five-and-forty years before, and
stood bobbing his palsied head, arrayed
in his holiday garment, a linen ephod or
smock frock, to which his Waterloo medal
was proudly affixed), was given heartily
enough. " God bless 'ee, Missy," cried the

old man in the shrill cracked voice of age,
as he pressed up to the carriage window.

Thank you, Jasper," said the girl with
a sunny smile. Strange to say, those two
words gave the old fellow more pleasure
than the thought of the unlimited potations
he knew he would enjoy that afternoon at
the squire's expense.

The wedding breakfast very much resembled
the similar festivities at which most
of us have assisted. The usual speeches
were made, nobody seemed very much inclined
to eat, but everybody's health was
drunk ; and I think it was rather a relief
to all present when young Mrs. Haggard
appeared in travelling dress, ready to quit,
for the first time in her life, the happy
home of her childhood. Then, and then
only, did the young person from the West
End millinery establishment remove the pins
from her mouth, which enabled her to
swallow a much needed glass of sherry ;
and then the squire's voice failed him, and

he saw his daughter rather dimly as he
pressed her to his heart for the last time
upon the steps. The bridesmaids relieved
their feelings by many salutes and much
tittering. As the carriage moved off there
w r as a perfect shower of satin slippers, and
it wasn't till it got quite out of King's
Warren village that the bride was able to
leave off bowing and kissing her hand to
her numerous w T ell-wishers.

Then the wedding party broke up into
little groups in the garden ; at first they
didn't amalgamate ; the men smoked, and
came to the universal conclusion that
Haggard was a lucky beggar ; while the
ladies talked over the interesting details of
the ceremony. Old Warrender retired to
his study in a rather excited frame of
mind, excusing himself on the ground of
his age.

And now everybody turned out with a
feeling of intense relief to witness the rejoicing
on the village green. The school

children were there enjoying rustic games
in a somewhat half-hearted manner, for they
had partaken with the appetites of young
boa constrictors of the squire's hospitality,
and each of them had a brand new shilling
or half-crown in his or her pocket, according
to age. A cricket-match was in progress,
but the bowling and batting were extremely
wild, thanks to The Warren strong beer.
But soon the Eev. John Dodd imparted
fresh vigour into the proceedings. The
youths and maids pulled themselves together
on his approach ; the more bibulous among
the men left the proximity of the big barrels
of strong ale, over which the squire's
head gardener was presiding. Lovers, who
had been promenading arm-in-arm, separated
for the moment by mutual consent, the
swains touched their forelocks to the vicar,
while Phyllis and Chloe smoothed their
skirts and courtesies low to Mrs. Dodd as
Lady Paramount. But the vicar meant that

they should enjoy themselves, and he whist
i. 9

peered to the squire, the squire nodded, and
the vicar called loudly for Blogg.

Where's your father, Jemima Ann ? "
he said to the poacher's daughter, who, in
all the glories of a pink print dress and a
much beribboned straw hat, had gone off
into a succession of courtesies.

"Please, sir, he's gone to fetch it" she
said.

At that moment the sound of a fiddle
was heard, and the smiling rascal who
played it, stopping his melody for an instant,
made a low and sweeping bow, which
took in the vicar, the squire and the
gentry generally. Then he clapped his
fiddle under his chin and without more
ado struck up " Bobbing Joan."

That's right, my man," said the vicar,
"you couldn't do better. Now men, now
girls."

But not one of them stirred.

Goodness me ! " cried the vicar, and then
he forgot himself. Could Mrs. Dodd believe

lier eyes ? her husband seized Jemima
Ann Blogg by the hand.

Come, gentlemen, set them a good example,"
he said, and he commenced to turn
Miss Blogg violently round. Before her
father had got through another two bars
of " Bobbing Joan," every soul on the
green had commenced to gyrate, the frown
died off Mrs. Dodd's face, as she too began
to turn with slow but majestic movements,
her hand clasped by old Warrender's, her
virtuous waist encircled by his aged though
still vigorous arm. Lord Spunyarn pounced
upon Lucy War render, Lord Hetton seized
another bridesmaid, Justice Haggard somehow
got possession of a third ; every village
Jack gripped his Jill, and all the parish of
King's Warren, gentle and simple, twirled
with one accord to the fine old tune of
Bobbing Joan." Once started there was
no stopping them, the fun became fast and
furious, and I fancy that it was with some

regret that the wedding party itself, having

9-2

set the ball a-rolling, retired to the more
dignified festivities which awaited them in
the great drawing room at The Warren.

It wasn't a large party ; they were most
of them Warrenders and Haggardss, and
offshoots and branches of those prolific
trees, or people connected with the families
from old association or friendship, but
there were quite enough of them to fill
the big drawing-room. Old Biggs, the
family solicitor, who had come down to The
Warren the day previously about the settlements,
and Blatherwick, of Lincoln's Inn,
who had fought him tooth and nail over
every item, in the interest of the Haggard
family, got their rubber; but both the legal
lights had soon declared that it was impossible
to play whist with dance music
ringing in their ear". The lawyers looked
rather sheepishly at each other when they
found themselves vis-a-vis in a quadrille,
Miss Hood having honoured the one, while
Stacey Dodd clung lovingly to the arm of

old Mr. Blatherwick. Of course it was
most unprofessional, but they probably
kept their indiscretions to themselves, and
no doubt charged them to their clients
under the head of " sundry attendances."
As for the Reverend John Dodd he seemed
to be everywhere at once, no one refused
the Reverend John. When the youngest
and best-looking of the bridesmaids told him
that she was danced off her feet the clerical
Lothario overpersuaded her in a few seconds,
and round they went like a couple of dancing
dervishes, being the last to hold the
floor.

But even wedding parties must come to
an end, though it was midnight before they
finally broke up, and at last Justice Haggard
and Lord Iletton walked over to
their rooms at the " Dun Cow."

It went off wonderfully well," said
Iletton to the Justice.

Capital, capital," assented the bridegroom's
father. " It's a great weight off

my mind, you know, Hetton. Reginald's
been an awful anxiety, but lie's a lucky
beggar, lie manages somehow to always
turn up trumps."

Yes," remarked his lordship, ;i that's
been his principal occupation since I've
known him."

Boys will be boys, my dear fellow ;
he'll sober down now, of course he will.
I know I did when I married," said the
Justice.

"I'll tell you what it is, Justice. War-render's
daughter is a very plucky girl ;
if she had known half you and I know,
Justice, she would have thought twice
about it."

The reformed rake, cousin, makes proverbially
the best husband. Why, 'pon
my word," continued the Justice, " when I
was a young fellow I was a regular devil."

Lord Hetton blew out a big volume of
smoke, and looked at his companion with
some curiosity.

When an old gentleman, in the fulness
of his heart, tells you that lie's been a
regular devil, you are bound to believe
him, particularly if lie's a Justice of the
Peace.

We were all devils in those days, my
dear fellow, but a man outgrows it ; he
marries, and he lives it down ; he takes to
a hobby. I did. I can't tell how I drifted
into pigs ; much in the same way as you
drifted into horses, I suppose. You may
take my word for it that pigs are far more
interesting and far more respectable, though
they're expensive, mind you. Yes, they're
uncommonly expensive ; so are horses for
the matter of that," continued the Justice.
Every man has his ideal, you see, Het-ton.
The perfect pig must ultimately be
produced. You mustn't look upon me, you
know, as a mere breeder of pigs. I am a
benefactor of my species." Here the pair
reached the "Dun Cow" and retired to their
respective quarters.

So ended George Warrender's wedding-day.
As Lord Hetton had remarked, in
engaging herself to Haggard she had done
a very plucky thing. Marriage is like
Mayonnaise sauce, either a great successor
an absolute and entire failure. The
materials which are blended together to
form a perfect whole are dissimilar and
have nothing whatever in common, but
once really thoroughly amalgamated the
result is very happy. Perhaps the marriage
celebrated in King's Warren church
may turn out well after all. It is to be
feared that like the sauce of sauces in the
hands of the inexperienced cook, the result
is more than doubtful. Fortunatus,
though a good fellow enough, is, like his
patroness, notoriously fickle. All we have
got to do, however, is to make ourselves
as comfortable as possible in our stalls.
The overture is over, the curtain is about
to rise on the drama of George's married
life. We haven't a play bill, and

don't know whether we are to listen to
some pretty pastoral, to a long three-act
farce, dignified by the title of a comedy,
or whether we are to be thrilled with
horror by a gruesome drama of intrigue,
limelight effect, and blood. We haven't
even seen a review of the piece ; the footlights
go up with a jump, and now the
curtain rises. Let us watch the players.

Lord Mayors DAY.

It was Lord Mayor's Day. Haggard and
his wife sat in the little drawing-room of
their bijou house in May Fair. The room
was prettily furnished, and George had
often accused herself of extravagance. The
regulation chairs and tables of the furnished
house had been banished from Mrs. Haggard's
drawing-room. It had been a pleasure to
choose the various tasteful specimens of the
upholsterer's art. The nesting faculty is
perhaps even more strongly developed in
young married ladies than in birds ; young
Mrs. Haggard was no exception to this ride.
Many had been the happy pilgrimages
made by George and her lover, for Haggard
was her lover still, to the great firm in Pall

Mall and to the world-famed house in Bond
Street.

i; Pick up what you like, my dear, and
make our drawing-room, your drawing room,
as pretty as you please ; nothing can be
good enough in the Ik tie kingdom in which
my George deigns to reign"'

But sugared compliments and furniture-buying
cannot go on for ever. A pile of
invitations attested the Haggardss' popularity.
Dance-giving mammas were anxious to secure
the success of their entertainments by
obtaining the presence of ;t lovely Mrs.
Haggard."

A well-known professional beauty in the
heyday of her charms was " sitting-out " at
a great ball, the observed of all observers,
in a dosrh-dos cause use with a Royal Iligh-
;. ss.

And is your Royal Highness also a
worshipper at the shrine of budding bucolic
beauty? I mean pretty Mrs. Haggard,"
said the spoilt darling of society, as with a

little moue she had indicated George, who
entered the room on her husband's arm.
The good-natured prince glanced carelessly
in the direction indicated ; his lazy eyes
sparkled as he quickly replied in a tone of
reproof :

Pretty is not the word, Mrs. Charmington
; if that is the lady you allude to,
she is lovely, absolutely lovely, and must
count amongst her admirers every member
of the human race who has had the happy
privilege of beholding her." His Royal
Highness rose.

Mrs. Charmington hastened to spread the
report that his Eoyal Highness was seriously
smitten.

Royal ripen early, I suppose ; naturally
they age as quickly ; perhaps his Eoyal
Highness is arriving at a second childhood,
and his heart turns to people of the Dolly
the Dairymaid type."

But in her first rage Mrs. Charmington
had been weak enough to let out that the

prince had called you? Mrs. Hazard
lovely." Mrs. Charmington had received
her own unsigned patent as a recognized
beauty from the discriminating admiration
of his Eoyal Highness. The fiat had gone
forth, and Julia Charmington had commenced
her reign. The Charmington boot
and the Charmington Bouquet were very
freely advertised. A reproduction of Mrs.
Charmington herself decorated the interior
of the omnibuses.

Why use dangerous cosmetics when
Jones' soap retains youth and health for
the complexion, and fosters the development
of beauty ? " Underneath the portrait was
a facsimile of Mrs. Charmington's* fashionable
scrawl, " I owe you so much, so very much.
I have never used any other soap than
yours. Very faithfully yours, Julia Charmington."


Ill-natured people said that Mrs. Charmington
owed a great deal to Messrs. Jones.
That the cheque that paid for her well-known

turn-out had been signed by the
firm ; that the) r had twice paid her dressmaker's
bill, when that terrible person had
become importunate ; that they had settled
the account of Monsieur Alphonse, the
great coiffeur ; that they had paid her
husband's debts. Some of them, more
imaginative, declared that Mrs. Charmington
was even a sleeping partner in the
saponaceous firm. But the ill-natured people
were quite wrong ; it was not Messrs. Jones
who paid Mrs. Charmington's bills. Little
Jack Charmington, her husband, had a snug
four hundred a year of his own, which
quite sufficed for his modest needs. Mrs.
Charmington's graceful letter had been
written by her in a moment of good
nature, and, it may be said in confidence,
at the instigation, some eight years ago, of
Big Eeginald Haggard, who had looked on
the whole matter as a joke, and who had,
at that stormy period of his career, been
very much in Mrs. Charmington's confidence.

The real fact was that Mrs. Charmington
kept Messrs. Jones before the public, and
those astute advertisers did the same kind
office for the lady.

Thus it was that George became " lovely
Mrs. Haggard." This is what the writers
of serious books pompously call " the
secret history of the whole matter'

George now, to her astonishment, found
her movements invariably chronicled in the
society journals. It rather annoyed her
than otherwise, but her husband was pleased,
and that was enough for George.

The lazy giant was sprawling on the most
comfortable of the sofas ; the pair were
alone in the dainty little drawing-room.
Young Mrs. Haggard's eves were full of
tears. " Won't you take me with you,"
she sobbed appealingly, "it's only for six
months, Eeginald ? "

"I can't, my darling; it's a beast of a
climate, and the mosquitos would eat you
up. I shall only be away for six months;

you know I have made up my mind to get
rid of the whole bag of tricks. It's quite
true the land can't run away, but there are
always rows and revolutions and smashes
going on ; you can't trust anybody. Of
course, George, I should like you to go ;
but think of the risk. It won't wash at
all. We'll stay over Christmas here in
England. I suppose I must take you down
to see the old man, and then we'll go
straight off to Eome, and finish the winter
there. I'm getting rather bored, you know,
George, with the fuss people make in town.
It's deuced fine fun for you of course."

The fact was that this excellent husband
hated playing second fiddle, and he found,
to his astonishment, that young Mrs. Haggard's
social success had far eclipsed that
of George Warrender. As a good-looking
young bachelor, though a detrimental, he
had been very popular. As a wealthy
parti and a sort of lion he had been the
fashion himself the previous season, and to

his own knowledge his curly hair and big

moustache had caused a quicker beating of

the heart in many a female breast. But as

Beauty's husband he felt out of his element.

You lucky beggar ! " had been repeated

to him so often that he hated the phrase.

Of course, he still admired his wife as the

handsomest woman he had ever clapped

eyes upon ; he wasn't even jealous of the

great attention that George habitually

received. First, because he knew he could

trust her implicitly ; but secondly, and this

was far the more powerful reason, because

he was too much a man of the world ever

to render himself ridiculous.

You know we can have rather a jolly

time of it in Rome, George," he said.

You must by this time be as heartily

sick of the eternal tete-astute as I am. I

don't mean that," he said, springing to his

feet as he noticed that his young wife

shuddered and turned pale ; " but the fact

is, George, I don't want to be pointed at
vol. i. 10

like poor old Jack Charmington, and I
confess, dear," lie added with a smile,
that I should like a little more of ' lovely
Mrs. Haggard's ' society."

A very little crust thrown to the very
hungry is always accepted with gratitude.
George Haggard brightened up at once.
I suppose I must make the best of it,
dear," she said with a pleased smile ; " at
all events, I shall have you all to myself
in Borne."

Yes ; it will be quite a second honeymoon
; but I half promised your cousin
Lucy that she should join us. It'll be
beastly dull for her at The Warren, you
see, poor girl ; and she doesn't seem to
jump at Spunyarn, though he does hang
on. Is there any one else in the wind, do
you think, George ? " he said with some
interest.

No ; Lucy seems perfectly heartwhole,"
replied his wife.

I often wonder you two hit it off so

well," mused Haggard as he gazed into the
blue flames that flickered over the little
wood fire, for his wife affected a wood fire
as more cheerful. " Why, Lucy lias been
your only serious competitor this season ; I
wonder you aren't jealous of each other."

How can you talk such nonsense,
Reginald?" the wife replied with a sunny
laugh.

Then you don't mind her coming with
us on the Woman trip ? "

It showed that Mrs. Haggard had considerable
confidence in her own attractions,
as she innocently replied, " If you don't
mind, why should I, dear ? "

"Well, then it's all settled, old girl; we'll
put in the dull time in Italy. Old Pit
Town knows lots of good people, and
would give us letters, I suppose. In the
spring I'll just rush across and polish off
the Mexican affair."

His gaze again returned to the fire which

smouldered on the hearth

102

There was a silence.

Gradually Haggard raised his eyes ; they
rested on his wife, they took her in from
head to foot, and seemed to appraise each
of her numerous points. The husband's
countenance w T as lighted up by a pleased
expression.

By Jove ! George," he said, " people are
quite right ; you are an uncommonly fine
woman."

He kissed her.

It was the kiss of proprietorship, similar
to the appreciative pat he would have given
to a prize dog or a valuable horse that was
his own property.

Yes, George loved the man, and looked
up at him with wistful, trusting eyes. She
was his, body and soul.

But the door opens, and a peal of merry
laughter caused Haggard and his wife to subside
into seats on either side of the fireplace.

Oh, George ! I'm so sorry you missed it,
it's been such fun, and Mr. Sleek has been so

attentive. I really think the two girls thought
I was setting my cap at their father. What
with the procession outside, and the farce indoors,
we've had a delightful morning," cried
Lucy Warrender, as she entered the room.

I fear it was rather a tragedy to poor
little Sleek," said Lord Spunyarn, who followed
her ; " a tiger when a-lashing of his tail was
nothing to Sleek. I shall never forget the
look he gave me after lunch."

When inflamed with love and wine, you
know," said Lucy pertly. "Behold his
scalp."

Lucy triumphantly extended an enormous
formal bouquet. Alas, for poor little Sleek !
his flowers were carelessly tossed upon the
table.

Oh, they were very confidential, you
know," lisped Spunyarn ; " I was quite out
in the cold."

Ungrateful man, when you had a window
all to yourself, and a smiling Miss Sleek on
either side of you, gazing into your eyes. You

neglected your opportunities, Lord Spunyarn.
Let me tell you that the daughters of my last
conquest are two very pretty girls."

Not when Miss Warrender is present."

I rather think you forgot Miss Warrender's
presence," retorted the coquette.

Anyhow, two's company and three isn't,
you'll all allow that. How happy could I have
been with either were t'other dear charmer
away."

Did they both propose to you, Lord
Spunyarn ? " said Mrs. Haggard with a
smile.

If I were a vain man I should confess that
they rather gave themselves away."

"Much as Hannibal Peter Gray did for love
of the beautiful cannibal," said Lucy.

"Oh, they were quite safe in my case, not
being a mangeur devours" replied the discreet
young nobleman. " But my attention was not
sufficiently absorbed by those guileless girls
that I failed to perceive the doings of the
other couple."

You are quite wrong, as usual. Mr. Sleek
was merely explaining who the various people
were."

In that case, Miss Warrender, lie might
at least have given us all the benefit of his
information, instead of conveying it in an inaudible
whisper to Miss Warrender's private
ear. And he needn't have blushed till he
looked like a pickled cabbage."

It's not fair, Lucy," said Mrs. Haggard
reprovingly, with an attempt at matronly
dignity.

Well, you know," laughed the girl, " it
wasn't my fault. Spunyarn declined to come
to the rescue. There I was, practically tete-tete
with the man ; the noise of the crowd
drowned my cries and remonstrances. Besides,
after the scalp, and the elaborate lunch which
was awaiting us in the middle of the room, I
felt myself bound to listen to the voice of the
charmer. I was cheered, too, by Lord Spun-yarn's
masterly defeat of Dabbler. Poor
Dabbler ! "

Ton my word, I didn't know it. When
we came in there was a fat man messing with
the things on the table. He was dressed like
a waiter, and he looked like one  a regular
City waiter, you know. He held out his hand.
Of course, I gave him my hat and coat. He
has no business to dress like a waiter and to
hold out his hand."

Lord Spunyarn, he is a common councilman,
and he is going to dine with the Lord
Mayor," cried Lucy.

"All the same, he has no business to be
dressed like a waiter in the morning, if even
lie be a common councilman and going to
dine with the Lord Mayor. Anyhow, he took
the hat and coat, and then, thank heaven, he
bolted."

"What's Dabbler to him, or he to Dabbler,
that he should weep?" misquoted George's
husband, who had enjoyed Dabbler's discomfiture.


"It's all very well for you all to laugh,
but Mr. Sleek didn't seem to like it at all.

What did he mean by saying that Mr.
Dabbler was a warm man ? " asked Lucy.

Oh, piles of money of course ; all the
common councilmen have piles of money,"
said Spunyarn.

And do they all dress like waiters in
the morning, and then dine with the Lord
Mayor ? "

Yes. I suppose it's an old City custom,
you know. Anyhow they always dine with
the Lord Mayor. That's what they die
of."

And now I have something to tell you,
Lucy," said Mrs. Haggard. "It's all been
decided. After the Christmas festivities at
the Castle we are to go to Rome, and we
hope you will come too."

Lucy clapped her hands with girlish glee.
Go with you, George dear ? Of course I
will. How good of you to ask me." The
girl was evidently delighted.

And have you the heart, Miss Warrender,
to leave me, Mr. Sleek, and your

other countless admirers, here in England
to 'dree our weary weird alone?'

And so the idle talk ran on. The
Italian trip was discussed, and considerable
ignorance of geography was, as is usual,
manifested by all present. Lucy expressed
her disappointment, on being informed that
there were now no brigands in Italy, save
those behind the shop counters, or in the
choruses of the opera.

A trim maid then brought in the tea equipage,
and George did the honours with
her usual unaffected grace.

And now Parson Dodd and his sister
were announced. The Dodd presented a
rather dishevelled appearance. They, too,
had seen the Lord Mayor's Show. But the
vicar, in a moment of weakness, had yielded
to Anastatia's wish to see something of the
real Londoner, whom "dear Dickens has
described so well," as she had put it.

Great had been her indignation at the
want of respect shown to the Reverend

John Dodd's cloth. With horror she had
heard her brother addressed by a disreputable
costermonger in a mangy fur cap,
as " Old pal." And though the Reverend
John stood all unmoved in the surging
crowd, muscular pillar of the Church that
he was, it was only by clutching him very
tightly that poor Anastatia preserved herself
from annihilation. She had seen the
Lord Mayor's Show indeed, but at what a
price ! The long grey cloak which she
wore, a sort of semi-religious garb which
Miss Dodd, as a clergyman's sister, affected,
had been splashed with mud and creased
into a thousand wrinkles. Her maiden
feet, which had never felt the sacrilegious
touch of the toe of obtrusive appreciation,
had been trampled on by an exhilarated
London mob. And after several hours of
agony, just as the Lord Mayor was
actually passing, she had heard and felt
a horrid rending, crackling sound, and had
almost shrieked into her awe-stricken

brother's ear, " Oh, Jack, I'm gone at the
gathers ! " What she meant neither the
Eeverend John Dodd, or any other male
person, could ever truly know. But
evidently something dreadful had occurred.
Take me back, Jack ; take me back to
Mrs. Haggard's at once," the poor little
woman had pleaded to the parson. He
got her into a cab at last, and they had
reached the Haggardss' house in May Fair,
at which they were stopping for the night.
But George Haggard came to the poor
lady's rescue ; she and her cousin bore her
off to her hostess's own quarters, where
she detailed her sufferings to their sympathizing
ears. Eau de Cologne was duly
dabbed upon her temples, strong tea was
administered, but at length the wounded
feelings of the vicar's sister found vent ina
little gentle fit of sobbing, and she was
accordingly put to bed.

What possessed me I can't imagine,"
said the Eeverend Jack to his two male

friends ; " we were quite comfortable at
first, you know," said poor Jumbo, warm
with the remembrance of his numerous
humiliations. " I had put Anastatia on a
bench ; the man made an exceedingly
moderate charge of threepence. I gave
him sixpence, and strange to say he had
no change. I didn't like to be done ; the
man urged me to occupy one place that
was yet vacant ; my evil genius prompted
me to do so. Alas ! I had no sooner
stepped upon the frail structure when it
suddenly and unaccountably gave way in
the middle. I was precipitated to the
ground in a sitting posture. Anastatia was
fortunately unhurt, but she was much
frightened. Those who had paid for the
use of the bench demanded their money
from me ; while the miserable proprietor,
who had previously been most respectful,
in a truculent manner, and with horrible
menaces, claimed a sovereign, and on my
declining to comply with his extortionate

demand, he actually offered to fight meme
a clergyman of the Church of England.
From a sense of justice, I hastened to
remunerate those who had been deprived
of their coism of vantage, but, alas ! the
claimants were innumerable ; every man
and boy in my vicinity declared that he
had paid for a place. The mob cheered
me w T with derisive epithets. The climax was
reached when a most offensive policeman
in a dictatorial manner ordered me to
'Move on.' The Church of England, in
my person, was ordered to ' move on.'
I attempted to remonstrate, but I and the
proprietor of the broken bench were both
suddenly propelled by the Jack in-office
into a bye street, and I discovered, to my
horror, that I had lost Anastatia. Of
course I had to satisfy the ruffian's insolent
demands, but I did so under protest. The
officer, however, now became more civil, and
T, fortunately, with his assistance, was able
to rescue my sister from the mob. I will

take another cup of tea, if you please.
Thank you, three lumps. I have seen the
Lord Mayor's Show, never again will I
assist at that degrading spectacle."

In vain did Haggard and Lord Spun-yarn
attempt to reassure the indignant
vicar. Only on the return of Mrs. Haggard
and Lucy did the Eeverend John
Dodd become comparatively tranquil. Under
the soothing influence of beauty, however,
the vicar forgot his woes.

*-

AT THE CASTLE.

The Haggardss were heartily glad to leave
town. The nasty scandal at the Pandemonium
had been particularly irritating to
Haggard personally. " Thank God," he
said to himself, " the head of the family will
probably never hear of it, unless Hetton
should go out of his way to tell him ; but
I don't think he'd do that, he's not too
particular himself, so it would be only a
case of the pot calling the kettle, after all.
It wasn't my fault. How could I know
the young idiot was drugging himself with
Chartreuse ? I was too much interested in
the game. Besides, some one was bound to
have his money sooner or later ; in fact,"
pondered the big man, " I've been rather ill-used,

when I come to think of it. It's just

my luck."

Just his luck ! Yes, it was just his luck ;

just his luck to squander every farthing he

possessed, and to be pitied by everybody

when deported to do the best he could for

himself. Just his luck to have what the

Americans call a " high old time " in

Mexico, to hunt, to shoot, to enjoy the

free wild life and absence of restraint in

America. Just his luck to thoroughly

clear out that wealthy gambler Don

Emanuel Garcia, at poker ; but then

Haggard had all the qualifications for a

poker player : he had the very luck which

he grumbled at ; good temper, for your

thoroughly selfish man is far too fond of

himself ever to be other than o'ood-tem-

peered ; his " cheek " was unlimited, and in

the bi " flutter " with the Mexican, he

had also had u'ood cards. Given good luck,

good temper, good " cheek," and good

cards, a poker player is always invincible ;
vol. i. 1 1

so the Americans say, and they ought to
know. Just his luck to become the
possessor of a large sum of ready cash,
when valuable land was going a-begging ;
just his luck at that precise moment to
invest his easily-got winnings in the
Mexican ranches and pastures, now worth
ten times what they cost him. Just his
luck to come home at the right moment to
be accepted by the loveliest girl in Essex, a
girl whose beauty had now even received
the imprimatur of so fastidious a judge as
his Eoyal Highness. Just his luck to be
adored by his young wife, and looked
upon by her as a king of men ; to be
clothed in purple and fine raiment, with the
possibility of a peerage and the possession
of immense wealth in the future. But he
was quite right in carping at her, for
fortune, like other fickle jades, is more
likely to be true if steadily abused.

The two girls, his wife and her cousin,
interrupted his soliloquy. The gaieties of

the season had, if possible, rendered
George's beauty still more perfect. A succession
of recherche entertainments, of concerts,
balls and routs, and their attendant
late hours and excitement, had given the
young wife that almost indefinable stamp
of delicate refinement for which we have
no word, which is so seldom seen in
England, and which the Italians call .


But there was no morbidezza about Lucy ;
she, too, had shone, perhaps with a certain
amount of reflected lustre ; but she had
shone, she had dazzled. When a very
young woman is exceedingly good-looking,
no prude, and prepared to go any lengths,
being at the same time perfectly heartless,
she is bound to be a success, and Lucy
had been a great success. The Due de la
Houspignolle, the French Ambassador in
London, that duke who was so much missed
from the cotillions at the Tuileries of his

imperial mistress, had pronounced Lucy

112

petulance. M. Barbiche, his second secretary,
the best valour of the season, had declared
that Miss Warrender was the lightest stepper
in town. " She make my heart to beat as
it never beat before," said the young
diplomatist to his chief; "but she is not
distinguished like her cousin, she is a
woman. I think her cousin is only a goddess
after all. They are cold, these married
English. I suppose it is the ' spleen.' ' :

"You'll get back your roses, old woman,
at the Castle," said Haggard to his wife.
"I think we've both had about enough of
it," said he, as he poured out a brandy
and soda. " I'm getting rather sick of seeing
my wife twirled round like a teetotum by
a succession of well-dressed idiots, while
twenty more noodles round me are all
saying how very charming she is, and consequently
1 acting and envying me. It's all
devilish fine for you girls, but I really
think I shall enjoy a fortnight's dulness
and the counting of possible chickens which

may never be hatched at Walls End.
Anyhow, one will get one's rubber'

And I shall have two new strings to
my bow in the shape of Hetton and his
cousin. By-the by, what is Hetton like ?
One can't judge of a man at a wedding-breakfast,"
said Lucy.

Oh, horsey ; when you say that you say
everything."

I've a good mind to upset all your
plans, Eeginald, after all," said the girl.
Lady Hetton would look well on my cards.
And then I should come in for the Walls
End diamonds. By the way, are the Walls
End diamonds black diamonds ? "

Bother Hetton ; you've got about as
much chance with him as with the old
man, my dear," for it annoyed Haggard
to see the slightest cloud to his prospects,
even were it no bicker than a man's hand.

"Anyhow, there are two bachelors, Reginald,
besides his lordship, who is hardly a
bachelor, being, I suppose, wedded to art."

Oh ! three, my dear ; you have forgotten
my father ; he, too, is aged, but
impressionable. If you'll only talk about
pigs, Lucy, and manifest an intelligent
interest, especially in black ones, you can
put my nose out of joint most effectually ! "

I should make a stern stepmother,
Reginald."

Of course, unjust novella, and all the
rest of it, I suppose. I don't know about
the sternness, my dear, but I can answer
for the crispness."

Thank you for nothing, Eeginald ;
however, I shall certainly take a dip in
the lucky-bag at the Castle."

ci By Jove, Lucy! there's Wolff for you."

"And who is Wolff?" asked his wife.

Wolff, my dear, is the toad-eater. In
the old days every great man kept a toad-eater
; sometimes his functions were highly
paid  Wolff's are, I fancy. A dish of toads
of the largest and most repulsive variety
used to be offered one by one to the big

man's relatives and guests. A good many
would partake of them. It was the toad-eater's
office to devour the remainder with
apparent gusto."

"Reginald, you're a wretch! and I don't
believe a word of it," said Lucy.

Haggard yawned, drained his glass, and
they retired to prepare themselves for the
journey to Walls End Castle, which was to
take place on the morrow.

Lord Pit Town was determined, on this
occasion at least, to break through the rule
which he had stringently observed since
his return to Walls End Castle. For many
years no lady had graced the great old
house with her presence. It was considerably
to Justice Haggard's astonishment that
he heard of the invitation to his son and
his son's wife. " Hetton won't like it," he
muttered to himself, as with the point of
his stick he gently titillated the back oi
one of his favourite black pigs. The
animal stood perfectly still, grunting with

suppressed delight. " Hetton will be decidedly
savage," mused the old gentleman.
"- 1 wonder whether Eeginald will get something
in the will ? " pondered his father,
his eyes fixed on the black pig's ears.
He's a lucky beggar, Eeginald, a very
lucky beggar, and Warrender's daughter is
more than he deserves." Few fathers think
that any woman is more than their son
deserves, particularly when that son is an
only son, wealthy, and a possible heir to a
peerage ; but we may take it that Justice
Haggard knew pretty well what his son deserved,
and that when he considered George
more than his son deserved," Justice Haggard
was probably right. If the prodigal
really had his deserts he would still be
chewing husks with the Mexican swine 
husks which the magnificent specimen of
the porcine race who was so delightedly
submitting to the caresses of the Justice's
stick would doubtlessly have indignantly rejected.
" I wonder why," continued the

meditating Justice, " Hetton don't marry ? "
Perhaps Mademoiselle Zizine, of the French
theatre, was the reason  who knows ?
Hetton didn't go into society, not that
society wouldn't have been very glad to
receive Lord Hetton, being Lord Hetton,
even if he had been a Siamese twin or a
Spotted Boy, which he wasn't. But Lord
Hetton found that society cost money, and
only placed an additional barrier between
him and the object of his ambition  the
blue ribbon of the turf. Hence when Lord
Hetton sought distraction from race meetings
and TattersalFs, he found it in the
society of Mademoiselle Zizine and her like.
Evidently the question of why Hetton
didn't marry perplexed, the Justice ; he
paused in his attentions to the pig ; the
animal, who was black but cornel', missing
the accustomed caress, gave a little snort
of impatience. "Bother Hetton!" said the
Justice, administering a sudden and unexpected
prod to that tender but irritable

skin. The injured and indignant animal
gave vent to a succession of eldritch
screams. The callous Justice passed on to
the next stye, immersed in thought.

Great were the preparations at Walls End
Castle, and greater still the astonishment
of the old housekeeper when she heard that
the winter house party was to be graced
with the presence of ladies. Not that what
were termed the state apartments were in
any way disturbed. The old show rooms
were left to the mice and ghosts, but the
more modern suites were all to be occupied.
My lady's own rooms had been allotted to
Haggard and his wife. The rather Spartan
simplicity of the late Lady Pit Town had
made her own rooms sombre, if not grim.
It had been a labour of love with the old
lord to change all this. The aesthetic gentleman
Messrs. Spick and Span, the great
upholsterers, had sent down, had been
severely snubbed by Dr. Wolff; the upholsterer
had submitted elaborate coloured

pictures of his idea, his firm's idea, of
what a suite of rooms should be. Part of
that idea was sham bric-a-brac, the rest
was carte blanche to Messrs. Spick and
Span. " We should like," said that well-dressed
and self-satisfied individual, " to
turn out a job worthy of our house's
reputation and that of his lordship. We
should suggest that the boudoir be hung
with Japanese embroideries ; of course, there
would be an Aubusson carpet, and we
should cover the whole flooring "  which
Mr. Veneer contemptuously indicated with
his umbrella  " with our patent parquet ;
probably a mediaeval pattern would be the
most suitable. We should restore the ceiling
and liven up the mouldings with a
free use of gold ; in fact, my advice in
the matter is, that his lordship should place
himself entirely in our hands. Of course,
money's no object. His lordship cannot do
butter than to rely upon the taste of our
Mr. Spick."

1 do not think it shall be so, my
friend," Wolff had replied. "You will
put fresh and pretty papers on the walls.
Your hangings must be of chintz, of pretty
chintz, and you will put a cheerful carpet
on the floor. As for furniture, there is
plenty of that here, but the chairs and
the sofas you shall provide ; one thing only
you shall remember  they shall be comfortable.
His lordship will sit in every chair ;
if it is not comfortable it will L r o back.
As for the ceiling you shall not touch
him'

Messrs. Spick and Span's representative
was wounded in his tenderest point, but
lis firm carried out the order to the letter.
The old lord had sat in each chair and
was satisfied. The ceiling, which represented
the triumph of Venus, by Yarrow
T as left untouched. If we were permitted
to penetrate the secret mysteries of the
bedchamber, we should make the reader's
mouth water bv telling of the toilet table,

which was stamped " Biesencr," and bore
the mark, " Meubles de la reine. ,J We
should tell of the ormolu mounts of the
little table, and how it really once belonged
to Marie Antoinette. All the decorative
furniture of this suite of rooms had been
carefully selected by the old lord from
the vast accumulation of such things that
Walls End Castle contained. For several
weeks he and Dr. Wolff had pottered about
the set of rooms that were to be graced
by George's presence. When, to Wolff's
astonishment, the priceless Messenger, " The
Gray Musketeer," was selected as the one
picture to adorn the boudoir, he attempted
a remonstrance.

Nothing can be too good for her,
Wolff," said the earl, as he smiled upon
the picture.

Other rooms had been set apart for
Lucy, but their arrangement had been left
to Wolff

It was evident to the German doctor

that this patron looked forward to his
great-niece's visit with pleasure. On the
day of her arrival, for the first time in his
life, Lord Pit Town failed to visit the new
galleries.

At dinner, Hetton himself was surprised at
the amount of attention paid to George by
the head of the house. Haggard did not
attempt to conceal his satisfaction. Lucy
Warrender, ever ready for mischief, feigned
an intense interest in racing matters, but
failed to draw Lord Hetton. That guileless
bachelor, Mr. Haggard, of the Home Office,
proved more amenable to her fascinations ; he
knew that he should get his rubber after
dinner, and Miss Warrender's conversation
helped to while away the time until what was
to him the real business of life should commence.
As for the Justice he was in the best
of humours, he enjoyed his dinner, he enjoyed
his wine. But the '34 port was so good that
he revoked twice, to the indignation and
despair of his unhappy brother and partner.

The girls sang to the old man at his
express desire, and Hetton noticed with a
feeling of secret indignation that the antiquated
Broadsword grand had been replaced
by a magnificent Gerard.

The place seemed changed. Lord Pit
Town appreciated with mingled pleasure and
astonishment the brightening influence of the
ladies' presence ; the party, if not gay, was
at least cheerful ; the little leaven had
leavened the whole lump. They broke up
early, satisfied with themselves and with each
other. But Hetton's equanimity was again
disturbed in the morning when his lordship
actually proposed to drive Mrs. Haggard and
her cousin in the park. He retired in disgust
to his own quarters, where he consoled himself
by the inspection of his betting book
and the reading of his trainers last report.
Haggard, of the Home Office, in his own
room, with two packs of cards, worked out
historical games of whist and studied the
coups of Chapelle and the other great

masters. Dr. Wolff walked aimlessly up and
down the new galleries, and stopping before
Bab Chudleigh's portrait, soliloquized, as is
the manner of his race, " Ah, lovely Englishwoman,
you are but a painted portrait, but
all men admired you because they could not
help it ; if all they say be true, Madame
Jezebel, you were as bad a woman as lived in
your bad old days. Got in Simnel ! but you
are very like the leetel Warrender lady.
God forbid the leetel lady shall have a heart
like yours. No, I wrong that innocent
English mddchen. But you are both wun-
derschon. Hein ! " Arid then the doctor
continued his perambulations, and in his
dreamy way, he pondered on Lucy's seraphic
smile, and on her wealth of golden hair.
Such things are not for me," he thought.
I must go on loving the paintings and the
portraits to the end of the chapter," and then
he sat down to write a business letter about
Era Filippo Lippi to old Mr. Creeps. Justice
Haggard an 'l his son wandered about the

home farm ; the father criticized the piggeries,
while the son smoked a bier cigar and thought
of nothing at all.

Gad! Reginald," said the old man, " there's
one thing I can't understand. Pit Town, who
looks after most things, neglects these poor
beasts in a most shameful way ; if ever I
came into the title I should make it my first
business to pull down the whole range of
buildings"' here he indicated the piggeries
in an indignant manner ; " they are a disgrace
to the place, sir ; the sight of them offends
me."

Well, father, I hope you may, I sincerely
hope you may carry out your own ideas here
some day," said the dutiful son ; " but 1 don't
think the old man cares very much for your
hobby, you know."

fct Then he neglects his duties, that's all,"

replied the old gentleman with an indignant

snort. " Of course, Pit Town's in the fashion"'

he continued, " for we hear about nothing 1

but art now-a-days ; but I should like to
VOL. i. 12

know where he benefits his race. His
ambition is a purely selfish one, while mine
is distinctly benevolent. The dream of my
life, Eeginald, is unrealizable. I know that
I can never succeed in producing the being
I see in my dreams, a perfectly boneless pig ;
a sort of animated sausage, where fat and
lean Shall be deliciously blended in the
requisite proportions. I know I strive after
the unattainable, but still every year I get
nearer and nearer to the goal. When I
remember, sir, what black pigs w r ere when I
was a boy, and what they are now, thanks
to my efforts and those of the noble little
band of enthusiasts like myself, I feel that
I am leaving a lasting monument behind me.
Why, only yesterday, sir, when Dr. Wolff
pointed out to me what he called a specimen
of George Morland's best manner, I felt what
giant strides of progress we have made.
There were the pigs of his day, represented
as great gaunt bony bristly creatures,
wallowing at large, sir, in muck and mire.

We never see such horrors now ; and I
actually envied Pit Town the possession of
that picture. I should like to hang it up,
sir, in my piggeries at The Priory, that the
world might look upon what the animal was,
and in contrasting him with the superb
creatures I possess, appreciate what can be
done by care, breeding, feeding, and proper
selection. The time will come, Eeginald,
when every English speaking man or woman
who puts a piece of pork or bacon into his
mouth will bless the name of Haggard. But
these are but ambitious dreams, Eeginald,
never perhaps to be realized."

The party at Walls End Castle, though
its elements were decidedly heterogeneous,
was a success. Everybody was sorry to go
when they left, and their host regretted the
departure of his visitors.

The place seems quite dull without them,

WohT," he remarked. " I think I shall try

to see more of my relatives, but we must

make up for lost time, Wolff. Why, since

122

the ladies have been here we have neglected
work shamefully."

It has been a pleasant time, Lord Pit
Town, for me, for I love enthusiasm in the
young. It has never yet been my fortune
to meet with so delightful and innocent a
thirst for information as that displayed by
the charming Miss Warrender. The soul's
confessions of that dear young lady were
delightful in their naive innocence. She has
learnt much during her stay here of the
canons of true art ; it will be to me an 
epoch."

The old lord looked up from the great
manuscript catalogue raisonne at the German
doctor.

So she made a fool of you too, Wolff,
did she ? "

My lord, she respected me too much to
attempt to make a fool of me. She, the
young neophyte, recognized in me a humble
priest of art."

Ah, Wolff," said the old lord with a look

at the great portrait of Barbara Chudleigh,
there are some women who don't even
respect doctors of philosophy."

anastatia's courtship.

The Eeverend John Dodd drew back one
morning from the breakfast-table with the
air of a giant refreshed ; his wife stared at
him over the silver breakfast-kettle as she
had stared at him for the last twenty years.
For the last twenty years Mrs. Dodd had
wondered at the plenteonsness of her husband's
breakfasts ; she was astonished twenty
years ago, and she still stared, an awed
woman to the present day. " John," she
said, in a severe tone, " it is my duty."
Whenever Mrs. Dodd differed from her husband
she nailed her colours to the mast ;
she said it was her duty, and she invariably
carried her point. "It's dogged as does
it," is not only the maxim of agricultural
labourers in remote country districts. It

is the secret of success in every married
lady's life ; it is the talisman confided to
the young wife by her more experienced
mother, if she have one, if not her aunt
tells her the secret, and it comes to the
same thing.

"Well, my dear, if you look upon it in
that light there is no more to be said,"
acquiesced the husband.

It is my duty, and yours too, John ;
above all it is Anastatia's. What can
cement the natural alliance between the
squire and the vicar of the parish, more
strongly than the former's union with that
vicar's sister? Besides, I have another
reason. It is our bounden duty, Jack,"
here the vicar's wife relapsed into familiarity,
as she always did when she meant
to carry her point, " our bounden duty
to rescue the squire from that designing
woman."

Good gracious, Cecilia, who is Anas-tatian's
rival ? "

You may not have seen it, John, but I
have observed it ever since the girls have
Seen away. Miss Hood means to marry
the old man ! " This latter sentence was
tittered in a sepulchral whisper.

Nonsense, Cecilia, you're joking."

"Do I ever talk nonsense or joke, Mr.
Dodd ? " answered the wife in a judicial
tone.

Well, my dear," apologetically rejoined
the vicar, " I don't think I ever remember
your doing the latter," and he felt much
as an unfortunate man would feel who
had dared to accuse the Lord Chancellor
himself of joking and talking nonsense.

There can't be a doubt of it. Ever
since those girls have gone Miss Hood has
called here in The Warren brougham, never
on foot or in the pony chair."

"But, my dear, the weather has been
wet and cold."

'Tis not the weather, John, it is that
woman's arrogance, her way of preparing

the minds of the neighbourhood for the
catastrophe."

Diggory Warrender, my dear, is no
more thinking of marrying again than I
am," said the vicar.

The thought of marrying again, Mr.
Dodd," retorted his wife severely, " is constantly
occurring to the mind of every
married man."

64 1 assure you it never occurred to mine,
my dear."

John, you're ungrateful," replied his
wife, and burst into tears.

If my thinking of marrying again, my
dear, will prove my gratitude to you, I
will consider the matter at once," said
the vicar of King's Warren, with a dreary
smile.

But Canon Drivel's daughter did not
deign to answer, she merely rang for
prayers. In hied the servants, the two
grim housemaids and the parlour maid of
portentous plainness, for Mrs. Dodd made

it a rule in her austere household that
the abigail should be unattractive. Mrs
Dodd opened the book  her father, the
Canon's, well-known book of Family Prayers.
Although it was the second Thursday in
the month she turned to the portion appointed
for the first Wednesday. Alas!
her copy of the Canon's work opened
almost mechanically at the first Wednesday
in the month, for in that Wednesday's
selection there was a phrase which was
very dear to Mrs. Dodd ; it was the following
: " And if there be one among us
whose heart is yet hard," &c, &c. This
was Mrs. Dodd's ultima ratio, the last drop
that invariably wore away any resistance
on the part of the man who, to her mind,
was stony-hearted. When the Eeverend
John Dodd heard the commencement of
that prayer he trembled in his inmost soul ;
when his wife reached the favourite passage
she dwelt on the words with unction; and
as the servants filed out of the room he,

who had once been " Handsome Jack
Dodd," felt himself a slave.

I had better speak to Anastatia," said
Mrs. Dodd.

Do as you please, my dear," replied
the vicar, "but I don't see how she's
to propose to old Warrender, all the same."

Men don't understand these things,"
sententiously remarked his wife, as she
gave a vicious shake to the missionary box,
which was always on the sideboard. Missionary
boxes are not seen so often now
as they used to be, but this old-fashioned
engine of torture was clung to by the
vicars. Rosy-cheeked children had received
many a bright sixpence from the
vicar, their faces wreathed in smiles ; the
smiles had faded when Cecilia Dodd had
proved to them, by chapter and verse,
that the proper place for the bright silver
was the drab sarcophagus on the sideboard.
Even the vicar's friends, at the
termination of their rubber for threepenny

points, dreaded the appearance of the box ;
they invariably contributed, the more daring
among them sighing as they did so.

Anastatia Dodd, on the particular morning
in question, had not appeared at
breakfast. The fragile little lady was suffering
from a cold in her head. She was
in bed, perusing in undisturbed comfort
a harmless novel. But the novel disappeared
under the clothes with amazing
celerity as the voice of her sister-in-law
demanded admission. The mistress of the
house affectionately inquired if she felt
equal to a short conversation. In some
trepidation Anastatia signified her acquiescence.
Her sister-in-law pointed out to
her that old Mr. Warrender had been very
attentive lately. Anastatia innocently answered
that " He was a dear old man."

Oh, my dear, I am so glad, so very
glad, to hear you say so," said Mrs. Dodd.

"But why glad, Cecilia?"

"My love, your brother and I thought

it was so, and that you encouraged him.
Has he spoken to you yet ? He has said
nothing to John."

Spoken, Cecilia, to me ; about what ? "

This is affectation, dear ; you can't pretend
to be blind to what is apparent to
all of us."

Oh, Cecilia, how can you ? " sobbed
the vicar's sister, blushing to her ears and
burying her face in her pillows.

For forty years Anastatia Dodd had
lived in maiden meditation fancy free.
True, she had taken a lively interest in
all her brother's curates, but it was always
a professional interest and purely Platonic.
But now she blushed, blushed as she
had never blushed before.

What woman is displeased at hearing that
she has an admirer? Who among us would
fail to believe what we have, perhaps,
secretly wished for in our heart of
hearts ?

That arch Machiavel, the vicar's wife,

did not leave her sister-in-law till she was
thoroughly convinced that Diggory War-render
was only waiting a favourable
opportunity to make her a formal offer
of his hand and heart.

All this was sufficiently exciting to poor
Miss Dodd, but what was her horror, her
horror mingled with astonishment, when
she heard that, like the heroines in the story
books, she too had a detested rival. Till,
now Anastatia Dodd had not known what
it was to detest anybody, but her sister-in-law
pointed out to her that detestation washer
duty ; that Miss Hood was but a ravening
and roaring lion seeking to devour the
old squire, and then to pick his bones. Unconsciously,
as she stood by her sister-in-law's
bed, Cecilia Dodd assumed the awful
pose, the statuesque attitude, of the Judith
at the bedside of Holofernes of her former
days ; her hand, as it grasped the brass ball
at the foot of the bed, seemed to be clutching
the head of her victim. Poor Anastatia,

as a hare nestles in its form, had almost
shrunk beneath the bed-clothes.

It is your duty, my dear," said Judith,
to rescue this man from the hands of the
harpy at The Warren. He has evidently
loved you for years, Anastatia ; it is your
duty; and your brother feels deeply in the
matter, more deeply than I do, my dear ;
we are but weak women, he is a clergyman,
and, I regret to add, a man of the world.
You must, of course, give Mr. Warrender
every encouragement. And do not forget
that your brother is the head of the family,
the master of this house, a clergyman, and a
man of the world. lie will not see you
wronged."

The vicar's wife left the room and her
trembling victim. The voice of duty called
her to the kitchen, where her cook patiently
awaited her inevitable, and always painful,
audience.

In the meanwhile, Squire Warrender and
Miss Hood pursued the even tenour of their

ways at The Warren ; frequent letters from
his daughter, describing the delights of their
foreign tour, cheered the old man. All unconsciously,
the squire sent his hares and
his pheasants to the vicar's wife, his peaches
and his flowers to her sister-in-law. In his
cracked old voice, he still paid his Grandi-ionian
compliments to the two lads. He
was somewhat surprised perhaps to notice
that Miss Dodd was by degrees abandoning
her semi-religious garb ; and that his visits
to the two ladies invariably procured him
the pleasure of tete-astute interviews with the
spinster. He noticed too that the vicar's
sister now shook hands with him with an
unwonted pressure. One afternoon he actually
came home with a buttonhole, a
white passion flower, which the trembling
fingers of Miss Dodd had placed in his
coat.

Ton my word," he said to Miss Hood,
wearing this decoration as they took their
habitual cup of tea together, " I really think

that Stacey Dodd gets younger everyday."


Miss Hood pricked up her ears. Was
the hale old gentleman going to make a
fool of himself after all?

Old Mrs. Wurzel and the buxom Miss

Grains sat in the little room at the vicarage,

which was known to everybody as Mrs.

Dodd's own room. The vicar's wife sat

before a huge book, in front of her were

little piles of copper money. She and her

two visitors, and, of course, the vicar ex-officio,

formed the committee of the village coal

club. After much counting and recounting

of the coppers, the total was pronounced

correct, and the real work for which the

ladies had met was over. The window of

the room commanded a view of the lovely

old-fashioned garden, which had been the

care and pride of many successive vicars

of King's Warren. The close-shaven lawn

had the inevitable sun dial in its centre. The

garden was not at its best, for the trees had
vol. i. 13

not yet commenced to bud, but it was a fine
clear day, and the trim little figure of the
vicar's sister was seen briskly pacing up
and down the well-kept walks.

I don't think your sister-in-law seems to
care so much for parish work as once she
did, Mrs. Dodd," remarked the old lady to
the vicar's wife.

No, poor thing, I fear she has anxieties
of her own just now, she seeks solitude a
good deal."

Is there any attachment, dear Mrs. Dodd? "
said Mrs. Wurzel with interest.

Oh, Mrs. Dodd, not an unrequited attachment?"
burst forth the brewer's daughter.
For that strapping young woman was
romantic, and though the course of her
own love ran smoothly enough, still she felt
a sentimental interest in the woes of others,
real or supposed. Her fat red cheeks would
quiver with emotion, and be wet with briny
tears, over the sorrows of Mr. Trollope's
heroines. Fat people are always sentimental,

though they may not seem so, and beneath
Miss Grains' tightly laced corset beat a
sympathetic heart. " An unrequited attachment,"
she repeated, " is so very, very
sad."

The vicar's wife answered her reprovingly,
44 You must not think, Miss Grains, that Mr.
Dodd would allow his sister to form such a
disgraceful thing as an unrequited attachment."


44 Oh, but dear Mrs. Dodd, suppose she
couldn't help it," said the artless maiden
with a blush and a little sigh.

44 No well-brought-up girl would allow
herself to do so, my dear, she would have
far too much self-respect."

The brewer's daughter blushed deeply, as
she thought of the many heroes, real and
imaginary, from Marmion down to the last
curate but two, for each cf whom she herself
had felt an unrequited passion, or a
more than secret liking. But these hidden

passions were before young farmer Wurzel.

132

in his blue tie and white hat, had proposed
to her.

Well, at all events, Miss Dodd is hardly
a girl," she said defiantly.

Miss Grains'' retorted the vicar's wife,
"every unmarried woman, even though not
in the first bloom of youth, is a ' girl ' till
she marries. Certainly Stacey Dodd is a
'girl ' ; and I have known eases, Miss Grains,
in my experience, where flighty young ladies,
though they may have been temporarily
engaged, have remained ' girls ' to the end of
the chapter."

To this gruesome suggestion Miss Grains
made no reply.

Old Mrs. Wurzel turned confidentially to
the vicar's wife and said, " Is her engagement
generally known ? "

"Perhaps," replied the president of the
coal club, " it would be premature to speak
of it as an engagement, but it is talked of
all over the village. I believe there lias
been an attachment for some years, the

gentleman's attentions are very marked. In
fact, I don't think I am betraying her confidence,
when I say that the whole village
seems to be aware of it. Of course, I mention
no names. I should scorn to attempt to
precipitate m liters. It is a suitable match,
I am happy to say, for both parties, but
there is an obstacle, my dear ; adverse interests
are in the field. My sister-in-law is
somewhat of a prude. I too was a prude,
and I can understand her feelings."

Here Mrs. Wurzel peered at the vicars
with unfeigned surprise.

It's not quite fair, you know, to Staysail
Mrs. Dodd.

How was she to tell them, without mentioning
his name, that the man who did not
come to the point was the old squire himself,
and yet she was anxious to do so ?

At this moment the austere parlour maid
entered the room. " Squire Warrender is in
the drawing-room, madam," she announced.
Never in her life had the vicar's wife been

guilty of profanity till now, but the opportunity
was too golden to be missed.

"Talk of the devil,' 1 she said. The four
words spoke volumes. Her visitors took
their leave, to spread the report over the
village and parish of King's Warren.

Mrs. Dodd was a woman who, as we
know, did her duty according to her lights.
She was determined at all hazards to do
her duty now, without flinching, to her
sister-in-law, for she had already burnt her
ships, and she entered the drawing-room with
the deliberate intention of bringing the old
squire to the point.

The unsuspecting squire asked for the
vicar, after shaking hands with the vicar's
wife, and on being informed that his old
friend was from home he innocently hoped
that the vicar's sister was quite well.

Ah," said Mrs. Dodd with a sigh, " we're
a little concerned about Stacey."

You should let Pestle see her," replied
the sympathizing squire.

Now Dr. Pestle was the parish doctor,
and he deservedly enjoyed the confidence
of every soul in King's Warren.

I fear, squire, hers is not a bodily affection,"
said Mrs. Dodd with a deep sigh.

Good Gad ! you don't mean to say her
mind's giving way ? " anxiously demanded
the prosaic squire.

Oh no, we fancy it's an affection of the
heart."

Impossible! at her age. Why she's fifty,"
emphatically asserted the old gentleman.

"Not fifty, Mr. Warrender; Stacey Dodd
is but forty-one."

You don't say so. I should never have
thought it."

The opening of the engagement had
egregiously failed. At present the campaign
seemed most unpromising. When
a gentleman of mature years looks upon a
lady as fifty, he can hardly be suspected of
designs upon her virgin heart, or of a wish
to destroy her peace of mind. Beaten in

her attack on the outposts, Mrs. Dodd
changed her strategy with that multiplicity
of resource that always distinguishes the
greatest generals  she determined at once
to carry the war into the enemy's country.

You must miss the girls very much,
squire," she said as she took up a little
painted hand-screen, to protect her complexion,
on which she lavished much anxious
care, from the fierce blaze of the fire.
Yes," she continued, " you must feel it
very dull at The Warren now. Quite lonely,
I fear."

No," answered the squire cheerfully, w I
have Miss Hood, you know, and we play
bezique or backgammon of an evening."

Ah," replied Mrs. Dodd severely, and
horrible visions of those dangerous evenings
flashed through the mind of the indignant
woman. In her mind's eye she fancied the
squire sitting at the backgammon board
gazing at Miss Hood's shapely arm and
hand, for though Miss Hood was the same

age as her sister-in-law, she still had a very
shapely arm and hand.

Yes," said the squire, " and she reads
me the girls' letters ; they are a great consolation,
for George seems so thoroughly
happy."

What more dangerous occupation for a
hale old gentleman than to sit and listen
by the hour to the written raptures of his
daughter on the subject of married bliss,
read to him by a lady of prepossessing appearance,
by his own fireside, and after
having partaken of at least three glasses
of old port ?

I suppose," said the vicar's wife with
assumed carelessness, " that Miss Hood will
be leaving you soon ? "

The squire's eye twinkled with suppressed
merriment

Oh no," he said in a determined tone,
1 couldn't afford to lose Miss Hood. For
Lucy's sake," he added maliciously.

The lady fanned herself. There are limits

to the endurance of long-suffering woman.
Mrs. Dodd felt that she w T as being trampled
on. The sensation was new to her, and
unpleasant.

You appear to cling to her, squire," she
said.

Naturally, naturally," answered the squire,
"so do the girls. She has been more than a
mother to them."

Why not make her so in reality ? " retorted
the exasperated woman, losing her head.
Here the fanning became more furious.

The fact is, Mrs. Dodd," said the squire,
M I have been screwing myself up to that
point for the last dozen years, but I am
close on the age of the patriarchs, and I
don't think she'd have me. If you are of
a different opinion, Mrs. Dodd, I will reconsider
the matter ; of course it would be
most appropriate. There's no fool like an
old fool, I suppose."

Was the seemingly innocent squire referring
to himself, or had this abominable old

gentleman the temerity to allude to the wife
of the vicar of King's Warren as " an old
fool?" Who shall say?

44 Do you seriously advise it ? " went on her
tormentor ; " do you think I may dare to
hope ? "

But the vicar's wife answered him never
a word.

He rose to go and shook hands with her
in his usual hearty manner. By no outward
sign did Mrs. Dodd manifest her indignation,
but when the squire had left the
room she sank into her chair and burst
into tears.

44 The serpent ! " she ejaculated as she
pressed her handkerchief to her streaming
eyes.

Not one word did Mrs. Dodd utter for
many days to her husband of her momentous
conversation with the squire. In a
statuesque attitude, she sat, like Marius on
the ruins of Carthage, or Patience on a
monument smiling at grief.

And then she thought with horror of the
confidence she had made to old Mrs. Wurzel
and the brewer's daughter, not an hour
before. On a tire le vin, il faut payer la
bouleille.

ROME.  THE 1JALLO PAPAYANI.

The party had been in Rome three weeks,
they had all thoroughly enjoyed themselves,
and George Haggard had made no objection
whatever to her husband's putting in
an appearance at the Ball Papayani. The
great Carnival ball had been for years one
of the sights of Rome. Although the red
English guide-book merely discreetly remarked
that " the scene at Papayani's at
Carnival time should on no account be
missed," Baedeker and the other foreign
mentors devoted whole pages to glowing
descriptions of these more than Olympian
revels.

An Italian, as a rule, in Carnival time
is like an English boy on the fifth of
November  he is not happy unless he dresses

up. In this country, we are apt to think
when any one dresses himself up, that he
is disguising a fool. In Italy, on the contrary,
all the world is continually occupied
in masquerading in some way or other.
Costume balls, in all classes of society, are
favourite entertainments. Historical masques,
though not got up with the elaborate attention
to minute detail which is bestowed upon
them by the thoughtful beer-drinking and
sausage-devouring German, are yet of very
frequent occurrence. Every city, every town,
nay every hamlet, in Italy, has its long and
glorious history, often written in letters of
blood, always deeply engraved on the hearts
of the people. The mementoes of a bygone
time are cherished by the Italians. Consequently,
dressing up in Italy is universal,
and even the man who dines upon a penny
roll and a quarter of a melon, can afford
five centessimi, or one halfpenny, for a paper
nose, and it costs him nothing to flour his
face and hair.

Let us take an instance. Ivrea is a little
place, a small garrison town, celebrated for its
coolness and its cheapness ; thither the 
flock in crowds when the heat of the
city is no longer bearable. There is nothing
remarkable about the place ; it has its opera
house, at which ambitious young ladies, principally
English and Americans, pupils of the
Conservatory at Milan, make their debuts.
Happy garrison, happy sojourners in the
little Italian town ; they are provided with a
succession of interesting, though perhaps undeveloped,
prima donnas, who make their
little successes or their tiny frescoes at this
nursery of Art. But Ivrea, like all the other
Italian towns, has its history, its glorious
legend, which is never allowed to die, and the
Carnival of Ivrea is the time chosen for representing
the story and commemorating the
tragic history of the local heroine. In the
Middle Ages, Ivrea had its feudal lord. The
Count Arguing, as may be fancied from his
name, was a bold, bad man ; lie possessed the

terrible Droit de Seigneur, which he rigorously
exacted. The belle of the village was a miller's
daughter :

We never see such maidens now,
Such mill-wheels turn not round."

She was married. No sooner was the ceremony
over than the wicked count ordered her to
present herself at the castle. The command
of the feudal lord could not be disobeyed.
Bride and bridegroom, accompanied by the
weeping crowd, proceeded to the castle gate.
Count Arguing advanced to meet her with a
smile, unarmed and unattended. He was but
claiming his rights. As he stepped forward to
salute her, she presented her cheek to him,
and suddenly stabbed him dead at her feet.
The mob of relatives and friends wrecked and
burned the castle, massacring the retainers to
a man. The brave young bride was safely escorted
home, where the wedding feast was
triumphantly celebrated, and the miller's
daughter lived to be the happy mother of
many children, and died at a good old age.

From that day the Droit che Seigneur ceased to

exist in Ivrea.

This is the origin of the yearly ceremony at

the little Italian town. A pretty boy of seven

or eight years of age is chosen by each parish.

The boys are dressed in fancy costumes and

mounted on horses, escorted by the general of

the Carnival, who wears a black uniform, and

accompanied by his officers, who are clothed

in scarlet. During the Carnival the town is

under the rule of the general and his officers.

The party are received in state by the mayor,

the bishop, and the personages of Ivrea. A

poetical address is given at each notable's

house. On the second day, the children, some

eight or ten in number (they are called Abbas

on horseback, and escorted by the general and

his officers, head a procession, which passes

through the town, and which is joined by all

the carriages of the place, filled with ladies

in gala costume and men in fancy dresses.

Everybody dresses up. Then are thrown from

windows and balconies, oranges, flowers, and
vol. i. 14

real confetti, not the chalk coriandoli of Milan,
but good eatable sugar-plums. In the evening
the little theatre is illuminated regardless of
expense, a fabulous sum being expended on
extra lamps. Between the acts the Carnival
hymn is sung by the whole strength of the
company, the Abba children, the general and
his officers, who appear upon the stage ; and it
is a sine qua non that every one should wear
the republican red cap, even the Abba children
and the lady artists. The more enthusiastic
among the audience, male and female, also
sport the red cap of liberty. Secreted in the
omnibus box has been seated the prettiest girl
in the tow r n. The Mugnaia, as she is called, is
carefully arrayed in the costume of the bygone
time when the tragedy took place, and now
she is escorted by the general of the Carnival
to the footlights, a drum and fife band preceding
her, the Carnival hymn is sung, vociferously
encored and joined in by the audience.
The Mugnaia now returns to the box in which
she sits in royal state, the observed of all

observers. Of course, she is got up regardless
of expense. She, too, wears the little red cap,
and, as has been said, has been chosen for her
good looks. The opera is concluded, a masked
ball follows.

Xext day. at seven a.m., in every parish
the bride who was last married proceeds in
procession to the Piazza of that parish, and
with a mallet she indicates the place for the
annual carlo, or bonfire. She is accompanied
by her husband. The object of these scarli is
to manifest the popular exultation at the annihilation
of feudal tyranny. The pair now
return home, preceded by a drum and fife
band, and escorted by an enthusiastic crowd
singing songs of liberty at the full pitch of
their voices.

At two o'clock, the general of the Carnival

opens the public ball with the Miujnaia. This

is held in the Piazza Carlo Alberto, which is

the largest square in the town. The orchestra

is placed in the centre of the square. Then

there is a procession headed by the Mugnaia,

14 2

seated on a scarlet velvet throne, and borne
in a gilded car ; then comes a military band,
then the carriages filled with shouting masqueraders
and ladies in elaborate toilettes ; flowers,
sweets, and oranges, are thrown with amazing
prodigality as before. In the evening, again
the opera, again the masquerade. Next day
the procession takes place again, and there is
a public ball in the square till ten, then the
Abba of each parish solemnly applies the light
to his appointed carlo. When the last carlo
is burned out a funeral march is played and
all disperse to their homes. It may be mentioned
that the carlo is not literally a bonfire
in our sense of the word, but what we should
call a Venetian mast, bound with furze and
inflammable material, decorated with gaudy
ribbons and surmounted by a flag.

It is not likely that the inhabitants of
Ivrea, who thus commemorate her heroic
deed, will ever forget their Mugnaia.

But we have wandered away from
Papayani's, where the door was surrounded

by an enthusiastic crowd of the poorer
among the gay pleasure - seekers of the
Carnival. It was a rather trying thing for
the arrivals as they stepped from their
carriages and passed into the building
through a double line of sarcastic or
appreciative critics six deep. A quiet
brougham draws up at the entrance, the
door is flung open by a ragged masker, with
an enormous paper nose, in a tattered pierrot
costume. As he opens the door he bows
to the ground with an exaggerated humility ;
and Haggard, in his faultless evening dress,
steps out, with a frown upon his face, his
big form towering above the puny Italian
crowd as though he were a king of men ina
horde of pygmies. He hands a lady out ;
her pale blue silk domino hides her effectually
from the inquisitive gaze of the crowd.
Her tiny gloved hand clutches Haggard's
arm as he hurries her into the building,
which is one blaze of light, and from which
issue sounds of gay music and of the

rhythmic tramp of thousands of dancing feet.
The lady is discreetly masked, but though
her personal identity is thoroughly disguised,
she does not escape a fire of compliment
from the appreciative ragamuffins on the
pavement. "Ah! che ragazza bellidma."
"Chefiglia incomparable" And as an antithesis
to this flowery Italian praise, said one British
'Any to another British 'Arry in the crowd,
Did you see her ankles, George ? Do you
know who that lady is ? " Certainly the
white satin dress of the Watteau costume
that the lady whom Haggard was escorting
wore, disclosed an undeniable instep, and
'Arry's favourable criticism was not undeserved.
" I know one thing," said his
friend, " there was no humbug in the single
stone brilliant she wore as ear-rings." The
pair disappeared among the glittering and
gaily - dressed crowd that thronged the
portico.

M. Barbiche, formerly of the French
Embassy to the Court of St. James's, his eyeglass

tightly screwed into one of his wicked
little eyes, was lolling against one of the
pillars of the foyer. He was criticizing the
arrivals to Lord Spunyarn, who yawned by
his side, evidently thinking the whole affair
a bore.

Our Haggard, my friend, is what you
call an old fox, I fear. Who was the
charming girl in the blue domino he was
dancing with ? I failed to recognize her.
She is no habitue here. He intrigues me.
this Hazard of ours."

Pooh ! " replied the philosophic lord,
as he drove an unusually large volume of
cigarette smoke through both nostrils ; " some
milliner's apprentice probably, got up
regardless of expense."

No, my friend, the shepherdess was too
well clause for that ; besides, her mask
hides her face too well. Your milliner
would not be so farouche as to hide her
face, unless, ma foi, she had perchance a
bad complexion ; but our Haggard is too

great a connoisseur for that. However, he
shall introduce me to this mystery, and we
shall see."

I wouldn't try if I were you, Barbiche."
And why not, my friend ? Why not,
if you please ? Is this Haggard, this English
Adonis of yours, with the manners of a
prize-fighter, is he to croquer all to himself
all the pretty girls of Borne ? Is it not
enough that he shall have the prettiest wife
in Eome ? No, I wrong that angel, the
most beautiful and the most virtuous of her
sex. Is it not enough that this man shall
every morning sit down to breakfast with
the lovely Mees Lucy ? Ah ! when I think
of Mees Lucy, I remember myself once
more, and I think of those happy days in
the Quartier Latin, before my uncle does
me the honour to die, and I embark myself
in the diplomatic career. I study your
language in your Dickens, in your
Thackeray ; at last I attain proficiency.
You see it for yourself, no Englishman

ever shall suspect me, when we shall converse,
of being other than a Briton. It is
the same thing with the charming Mees
Lucy. I, a Frenchman, feel my heart beat
in sympathy with hers ; she is to me a
compatriote. We speak to each other as I
used to speak to Cascades in those old
happy times. Plan qa y est. This Haggard
of yours he shall have his most beautiful
wife, her most lovely cousin, but what shall
he want with this little shepherdess in the
blue domino. Bah," said the indignant man
as he stamps his foot and settles himself
down into his enormous color, " I say he
shall introduce me. Think you, my friend,
that I fear this 'la-out?' No, I am of the
first force, my Shirtings, at the savage."

"What's that?" said Lord Spunyarn
stolidly.

My friend, nous autres, we do not box
like you, but we use the savage. Behold,
then, what is the savage." And here M.
Barbiche suddenly threw himself into the

attitude of an enraged and aggressive
monkey. "A ruffian, he strike me, P- r-r-r-r-r,"
and here M. Barbiche sprang suddenly high
in air, and with one adroit and well-directed
kick knocked off the hat of the astonished
Spunyarn.

In the toliu boliu at Papayani's this
singular action of M. Barbiche excited not
the slightest surprise ; he simply received a
vociferous round of applause from the bystanders
in his immediate neighbourhood.
Excited by the success of his achievement,
Barbiche for the moment forgot the
Embassy, the Due de la Ilouspignolle, and
the proprieties ; he had been wound up by
Papayani's music, and by more than one
glass of Papayani's champagne. The Frenchman
became for the moment once more Le
petit Furibon, the darling of the Closer de
Lilas, the champion of the Qu artier Latin,
the Elisha upon whose worthy shoulders
had descended the mantle of the prophet,
the vanished Caoutchouc.

At this moment the strains of Arditi's
immortal waltz, " II Bacio," resounded
through the place. The head of M.
Barbiche kept time to the music, and he
regarded the dancers with a scrutinizing
gaze ; his eye evidently sought Haggard and
the mysterious shepherdess. As the ring
of maskers which surrounded the space set
apart for the dancers thinned, as numerous
couples joined in the waltz, the watchful
Frenchman was rewarded. " La voila, man
ami" he said, for Barbiche, when excited,
forgot the English of which he was so
proud.

Directly opposite Lord Spunyarn and his
French friend stood Haggard and his shepherdess.
She nestled at his side, clinging
to his arm and gazing up into his eyes.
The hood of the pale blue silk domino was
now thrown back, disclosing a magnificent
head of powdered hair ; the complexion of
the lady's neck and shoulders was dazzling,
and evidently natural ; her rounded arms

had more of the Venus than the Juno
about them ; her figure, as she gazed up
into Haggard's face, was seen to be perfection.
The little foot beat time to the
music of the waltz. But a black silk mask
with a heavy fall of lace hid every feature,
save a rounded chin and a pair of magnificent
eyes, which seemed to be pleading
to Haggard, and the shell-like ears in which
blazed the diamond solitaires which had
attracted the attention of the British " 'Arry "
in the street.

Haggard's face was suddenly lit up with
pleasure, his arm slipped round the little
waist, the left hand of the shepherdess was
confidingly placed on the shoulder of her champion
; they started and joined the numerous
pairs whirling round to the music of "II Bacio."
Soon the couple excited attention, of which
both seemed to be wholly unaware. Haggard,
though he was a married man, was still a good
dancer, and even here in a foreign ball-room,
where, as a rule, the dancing Englishman is

an object of ridicule, lie distinguished himself.
For Haggard, unlike most of the dancers present
(at all events those of the male sex), was
perfectly sober ; not that the proverbially
moderate Italians had exceeded in the use of
their light but notoriously nasty wines, but an
Italian easily becomes intoxicated, exalted,
exhilarated, beside himself under the combined
influences of a Carnival ball, the lights, the perfumes,
the music, the dancing, and above all
the eyes of his inamorata. Can we blame
Petrarch for being cheerful when Laura smiles?
But no Italian present was in so exalted a
state as M. Barbiche of the French Embassy,
once so well known as Le petit Furibon, of
the Latin Quarter.

As the pairs gradually dropped out,Haggard
and his partner became the cynosure of every
eye. In vain did Pasquin whirl his Contains
with the ruddled cheeks, varying his saltatory
gymnastics with an occasional scream ; in vain
did young Mr. Simon R Brown, that very
rough diamond from New York city, who had

come to Europe for polish, and was undergoing
the process (in the costume of one of the
Wise Men of Gotham who went to sea in a
bowl) at the hands of the Signorina Esperanza,
of the Scala, or any of the motley crew,
attempt to attract the public gaze : every eye
was riveted with admiration on the shepherdess,
that is to say, every male eye ; the
female organs of vision turned from her in
disgust, to admire or criticize her partner, and
in the end to feel dissatisfied with their own
peculiar victims. For if the masked shepherdess
turned the heads of most of those
present, Haggard was undeniably the best-looking
man in the vast arena. But even the
strength of a muscular English dancing man
must give way at length to the power of an
Italian waltz played fast at past midnight.
As for his partner, I believe she could have
gone on for ever, but she had perceived that
they were attracting attention ; she discreetly
drew the hood of her pale blue silk domino
over her head and hid herself in the recesses

of that mysterious garment. As ill luck would
have it, the pair pulled up close to the excited
Furibon.

Ah, mon vieiur" cried the Frenchman,
advancing with extended hands, " you
have rejoiced our eyes. Ah, gredin" whispered
Furibon, as he indiscreetly poked his
friend in the ribs.

"Ta ta, old man, I must be off," replied
Haggard with a frown, as the shepherdess
clung in evident trepidation to his arm.
For God's sake, Shirtings, take him away,
or there'll be a row," muttered Haggard to his
friend below his breath, his white teeth
showing beneath his black moustache in a
menacing manner.

The crowd of revellers was thick around
them. Barbiche was, as we know, a gentleman,
but our ideas of courtesy are not a
Frenchman's, and, as has been said before, he
had ceased to be Mr. Barbiche the viveur, for
the moment he was Furibon, the daring
Furibon of former days.

Saperlotte" he hissed, and his outstretched
hand touched the pale blue domino
on the shoulder.

The domino shrank as to avoid him.

Crash !

With one cruel but well aimed blow Haggard
smote the Frenchman in the moiith, and down
he went among the feet of the crow T d of indignant
maskers.

Look to him, Spunyarn," cried Haggard,
as he hustled his way through the crowd, and
in an instant disappeared, bearing in his arms
the fainting form of the shepherdess.

Vcevictis, alas for poor Furibon, where was
his boasted skill as a kicker? Why had he
not sprung high in air and delivered his unexpected
assault ? We must say of the savage
respectfully, as our Gallic neighbours said of
the Balaclava charge, best magnijigue, mais ce
nest pas la guerre. Seated on the floor, the
unfortunate Frenchman presented a piteous
appearance, as he shed mingled tears of pain
and rage, tore his hair, and wiped his cut lip.

Insolente birbone /" "Bestial /" "Cane! " Such

were the cries of the dancers on seeing the

blow struck, but they were levelled not so

much at the assailant as at his victim. In the

eyes of the bystanders, Haggard was evidently

looked upon as the protector of beauty in

distress. But as Valour bore off fainting

Beauty, and made his suddenly triumphant

exit, everybody's attention was directed to

the unhappy Furibon. A gentleman tearing

his hair, in the eyes of Italians, is a common,

interesting, and dignified object. The cause

of this performance is usually romantic, time

and place generally appropriate, but Italians

do not tear their hair at masked balls. As

everywhere else, a foreigner in distress in

Home is looked upon as a grotesque object,

and poor Barbiche was no exception to the

rule. At first he sat and wept, now he sat

and swore, but all the time he tore hard

at his hair. Haggard had disappeared with

the celerity of a harlequin who jumps

through a trap.

VOL. I. 15

Lord Spunyarn was somewhat bewildered ;
he, as a boxer, as an amateur though unsuccessful
athlete, knew what a good knock-down
blow was ; he had seen them delivered, w T with
varying degrees of energy, force, and vicious -
ness, but never in all his lordship's experience
till now had he seen a master-stroke which
combined all the above qualities in the superlative
degree. At last he got poor Furibon
upon his legs. The Frenchman carefully felt
his front teeth, doubtful if they were still
there, then he ceased to swear and to mutter
in his own tongue ; he ceased to be Furibon,
he became once more the correct M. Barbiche
of the French Embassy.

Minor, you have seen the insult. Monsieur
Haggard takes advantage of his physique,
of his brutal boxing skill, to maim me, perhaps,
Mon Dieu, for life, and to render mean
object of contempt and ridicule to these
grimacing apes," here he glowered at the
laughing crowd.

"But, my dear boy, it was your own fault,

you know ; what did you want to lay hands
on the domino for ? "

"In that there is nothing, Lord Spun-yarn.
Black dominoes, pink dominoes, blue
dominoes. Bah ! they are but public property,
minor, but I shall teach this Don Quixote a
lesson, this chivalrous protector of dominoes.
Yes," he added solemnly, as he crossed himself,
" please God."

Lord Spunyarn shook his head. There
seemed no other way out of it ; the
Frenchman had been struck, the insult was
in a public place ; an apology or arrangement
was impossible. Spunyarn was well aware
that Barbiche was by no means an antagonist
to be despised. He had been a journalist, a
career which in France may enable a man to
attain the highest positions ; from journalism
he had drifted into diplomacy, as French
journalists sometimes do. This was after his
accession to the fortune of a deceased uncle.
Of course, he was skilled with the small-sword,
as all French journalists arc bound to

15 2

be ; his reputation with the pistol was equally
deadly.

I shall send my friend to him in the
morning," said M. Barbiche calmly, as
leaning on Lord Spunyarn's arm he left
the ball-room. " I suppose you will act for
him ? "

"Don't know, I'm sure. I'm not up to
these things, but I don't see why you
should shoot each other over it."

The Frenchman shrusffed his shoulders
as he stepped into his perfectly-appointed
but funereal-looking little brougham. As he
drove home he meditated on his wrongs,
and in his heart of hearts lie swore that
four-ands twenty hours should not elapse ere
the insult should be avenged b} his own
skilful hand.

A MEETING IN THE GOOD OLD STYLE.

Lord Spunyarn woke with a very bad
headache indeed, the morning after the ball
at Papayani's. He hurried to commence his
dressing, for his valet on awakening him
had presented a thin and varnished card,
bearing a portentous coronet and the name
of the Comte de Kerguel. The man told
him that the visitor had come on business
of the most urgent nature. What his
business was, Spunyarn was well aware.
Knowing that, next to getting married, a
Frenchman looks upon the delivery of a
hostile message, as the most important, pleasant,
and serious event of life; Spunyarn wisely
dressed himself with care and deliberation.
When he entered his sitting-room M. de
Kerguel rose and profoundly' saluted him.

Minor Spunyarn. I have the honour of
addressing him ? "

"Yes, it's quite right, that's me. Please
be seated."

The Frenchman sat himself down bolt
upright.

I suppose, Lord Spunyarn, that my visit
is not unexpected. I had the honour to
call upon your friend Monsieur Haggard,
to demand satisfaction from him on the
part of my friend, Monsieur Barbiche. You,
I believe, were present at the whole affair.
Monsieur Haggard has referred me to you
as his friend."

Spunyarn bowed, stretched out his long
legs towards the fire, and opening his cigarette
case offered it to Monsieur de Kerguel.

Won't you smoke ? " he said.

A French gentleman in a new frock coat,
on the most serious of all missions, the
bearer of a hostile message to a man he
has never met in his life before, is asked
to smoke !

A crowd of strange thoughts parsed
through his mind. Are these Englishmen
cowards ? He drew himself up more stiffly
than before, as he declined the offer.

Have you breakfasted ? " said his hospitable
lordship, ignoring the gesture.

Lorxl Spunyarn," replied the Frenchman,
I come to you this morning purely as
the emissary of my insulted friend ; not to
accept of your kindness, or to trespass on
your hospitality."

Oh, of course I understand that ; but
you see we English don't fight duels as a
rule. Of course I should be sorry to balk
you, but can't it be arranged ? "

Lord Spunyarn, you are aware that my
friend was struck. In my country, no gentleman
receives a blow without avenging it.
Least of all a journalist or a diplomate. My
friend Monsieur Barbiche was one, and is the
other. In speaking of arrangement, minor,
I would surest that we are wasting time."

But I don't quite see that," persisted

Spunyarn, strong in his idea that the man
who fights a duel is a fool. " You see
there was a lady in the matter, and your
friend insulted her. Why man, he actually
touched her, I saw him do it."

Minor, ladies who go to masked balls
are accustomed to such marks of attention.
What my friend did was but a condescension
on his part. But there was a
blow struck, minor. Besides this, Monsieur
Haggard has referred me to his friend Lord
Spunyarn, I suppose with a definite purpose,
and not with the intention of causing me
to listen to, shall we say homilies, from
his lordship."

"The whole affair's a beastly nuisance.
I don't understand these things, but I will
try to settle the matter."

Minor, the matter admits of no settlement,"
said the Breton menacingly, rising
from his chair.

"I tell you plainly, Monsieur de Kerguel,
it is very much against the grain that I

have anything to do with the matter. Unfortunately,
as you say, I was present, and
I tell you that our friend Barbiche behaved
like a lunatic. Why he kicked my hat off,
and I don't want to call him out."

Monsieur de Kerguel smiled. " If your
lordship is in any way aggrieved by my
Mend's conduct, you have your remedy."

Oh, I could have had my remedy last
night ; if I had felt aggrieved, as you call
it, I should have done exactly what
Haggard did  I should have punched his
head, you knowe'"

Minor, no man of whatever nationality,
as you happily express it, l punches the
head ' of a French gentleman with impunity,
unless peradventure," said de Kerguel
with an insolent smile, " he is a coward
as well as a boxer."

"Do sit down," said Lord Spunyarn
imperturbably. " He's no coward," and
taking from his pocket a note, he handed
it to the Frenchman.

The letter was short but emphatic.

Dear Shirtings,

That ass Barbiche will send a
friend to you asking for a meeting. Agree
to anything he wishes and oblige

Yours,

"E. Haggard."

The Frenchman read the letter, reseated
himself, and with a bow handed back the
note.

I was precipitate, Minor. All this is
very irregular ; but we advance, though
slowly."

Yes, I suppose we do, worse luck. I'll
tell you what I'll do. Old Pepper is
stopping in this hotel ; there seems to be
nothing else for it, I'll send for him,"
said his lordship with a sigh, and he rang
the bell.

The waiter who answered it was directed
to present his lordship's compliments to

General Pepper, and to request his immediate
presence.

The Indian warrior had just breakfasted,
and entered the room in a few minutes.
He was introduced to the Frenchman ; a
few words from Lord Spunyarn sufficiently
explained the matter.

"I understand then, Monsieur de Kerguel,''
said the general, " that we are the challenged
party. As such we are entitled to
a choice of weapons ? "

Monsieur de Kerguel bowed. " Assuredly,
Monsieur le General," he replied.

You will excuse us then for an instant
? " said he, as he motioned Spunyarn
to the window. "This is a beastly affair,
your lordship. It won't admit of arrangement.
Do you know if the Frenchman is
best at swords or pistols ? "

Can't say, I'm sure," replied his lordship
; " probably he's a dab at both. I
know he was a newspaper man. They all
are fighting men."

It's most unfortunate for our man ;
they'll have to fight. Is Haggard any good
at either ? "

"I don't think he can shoot, at least
not in a regulation affair. I know he can
use a revolver, and he is very good at single-sticks*'


It's a heavy responsibility," replied the
general seriously. " If it had been arranged
for this morning at dawn we might have
had a chance with the pistols, for perhaps
the Frenchman's hand would have been
unsteady. I suppose it w T as a good knockdown
blow ? "

A regular snorter ! " said his lordship
with enthusiasm.

Most unfortunate. Well, we must try
our luck with a regulation sabre ; they can't
well refuse it ; ours is the stronger and bigger
man. I don't think there's any room for
doubt, eh? But it's a precious nuisance.
Man's got his wife here too. It's sure to
be in the papers. Beastly nuisance ; we shall

all have to clear out, for I suppose it won't
be a mere matter of scratches. It must
come off at once too, or we shall be suspected
of shirking. I think that's the only course'
said the general as he pulled down his wristbands.


I'm afraid so," said his lordship.

They rejoined the Frenchman.

"Monsieur de Kerguel," said the general,
seating himself, " we have elected to choose
sabres, regulation sabres ; you have no objection,
I suppose ? "

Sir, the weapon is unusual. As you are
doubtless aware, between civilians the small-sword,
the rapier and the pistol are what
are usually employed. The sabre is unusual,
and as a rule only employed in settling
the little differences of officers of cavalry."

Monsieur de Kerguel, his lordship and
I are here in the interests of our friend
Haggard. You are possibly unaware that
among English gentlemen the duel has ceased
to be a means in these degenerate days of

settling disputes. Unfortunately our principal
lias directed us in writing to agree to
your wishes ; and his lordship here has,
somewhat indiscreetly, I must remark, taken
you into his confidence. As he has done
so, sir," said the general, " and bearing in
mind that we are in a foreign country,
and that unfortunately a blow has been
struck, we feel ourselves reluctantly compelled
to accept the proposed meeting. Tt
is therefore our duty, sir, to protect our
principal, and we cannot consent to abate
one jot or tittle of our rights. Should you
decline the weapon proposed no meeting
can evidently take place," here the general
gave a little sigh ; " Lord Spunyarn is of
the same opinion. It is then for you to
accept or refuse ; in the latter case the matter
must definitely end here."

The Frenchman paused and thought.

Unfortunately, gentlemen," he replied,
my principal has left me no choice ; he
naturally declines any apology "

You will please to observe, Monsieur de
Kerguel, that we have offered none," interrupted
the general ; " in our humble opinion
the original insult, as well as the challenge,
conies from you, and we cannot deviate from
our position. We decline to modify our
terms in any way. And I would respectfully
suggest that this interview must definitely
terminate the matter one way or the other.
I would remark," fiercely added the general,
that neither we nor our principal are to
be cajoled or intimidated."

It shall be as you say, general. Nothing
remains then, I think, for us but to name
a time and place. The weapons, the most
unusual weapons, we are reluctantly compelled
to accept under protest. Have you
any suggestion to offer, general ? "

"None whatever, sir. One party shall
provide a surgeon, the other a pair of ordinary
cavalry sabres. You as a resident in
this infernal hole can doubtless surest a
suitable spot for the meeting. Of course

you will be provided with a second friend.
As to time, the sooner the better. We then,
if it suits you, will bring a pair of regulation
sabres. You, perhaps, will bring a doctor
who will act for both men. Perhaps you
will also oblige us by naming the time and
place of meeting."

"Gentlemen, the mill at St. Sterno is
only four miles off; it is secluded ; we shall
not be disturbed. You know the place ?
Five o'clock will, I think, suit us all? Is
it agreed ? "

The general bowed.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to salute
you," said Monsieur de Kerguel with a profound
obeisance.

The general rang the bell, and Monsieur
Barbiche's friend took his leave.

Thank God ! " piously exclaimed the
general. " I had him there ; Haggard is the
bigger and more powerful man, of that there
is no doubt. It shall not be my fault if
they don't settle their differences with the

longest and heaviest pair of regulation sabres
to be had in Rome for love or money. It's
quite against the rule, you know, but you
sav our man is good at single-stick, so he

> DO"

may have the luck to smash him or cut him

down before the Frenchman spits him, ashe

is bound to do if he gets the chance.

And I'll tell you what it is, my lord, I'll

take a glass of caracas, for I'm dry with

talking."

The caracas was duly brought, and

certainly the general deserved it. The

experienced warrior had perceived that De

Kerguul was bent on mischief, and by his

own coyness he had succeeded in beguiling

the Frenchman into accepting a weapon of

the use of which his principal was probably

totally ignorant. The men would then

theoretically meet on an equality. Buta

cavalry sabre is a big and comparatively

awkward weapon, and supposing that both

were equally unskilled in its use, Haggard,

as the taller and stronger man, would cere
i. 1G

vainly have the advantage. Besides this
the old general meant it, when he had stated
his design to provide a specially heavy pair
of weapons.

In his great anxiety to secure a meeting
at any price, De Kerguel had been compelled
to accept the general's ultimatum with regard
to weapons, " these or none ; " but he knew
that his principal thirsted for blood, so he
gave way, and it seemed to him at the time-that
the trifling matter of providing the
weapons was of little moment. But ere he
reached his friend's hotel he felt that he had
been caught napping.

Barbiche was extended upon a couch.
A huge piece of black court plaister hid
the wound on his swollen lip, a cup of tisane
stood upon the table. He was dabbing his
forehead with toilet vinegar. His head was
bound with a scarlet and yellow silk handkerchief
which he wore after the manner
of a nightcap, as is the custom of his country.
As his friend entered he sprang to his feet.

Have you arranged it, De Kerguel ? Will
he meet me, or are these Englishmen brave
only with their fists ? "

Do not excite yourself, Emile ; you will
have need of all your skill, of all your
courage."

He will come, then, this protector of the
demi-monde, this model moral English husband.
Say, is it sword or pistols, De
Kerguel ? "

Ah ! my poor Barbiche, I fear that I
have, as our American friends say, ' given
you away.' "

You don't mean to say that the coward
has apologized? This was no case for an
apology, De Kerguel, as you know."

I wish it had been," said his friend ;
unfortunately you are to fight."

Barbiche instantly threw himself into a
Napoleonic attitude. Under such circumstances
a Frenchman always feels himself a
hero, and invariably unconsciously assumes

the favourite pose of the Little Corporal.

162

"Yes, you are to fight, my poor friend,
but with cavalry sabres."

Barbiche suddenly buried his face in his
hands, and exclaimed in a broken voice, "Oh,
my mother ! "

When a Frenchman is in a very deep hole
indeed, he always apostrophizes his mother ;
on ordinary occasions he thinks little enough
about her.

Kerguel," he cried at length, looking up
reproachfully at his friend, " you must have
been mad. The sabre, as you know, is only
used among cavalry officers ; the pistol or
the small-sword are the arms of gentlemen."

And also of journalists, my friend. Of
that the ruse old general, our man's friend,
was unfortunately too well aware. You had
tied me down too tightly, my Barbiche ; my
instructions were to obtain a meeting at
any price. It w r as the choice of Hobson,
that or none."

Barbiche placed his hand to his swollen

hip.

And you were right, my friend. Let
us embrace."

They did so with effusion.

De Kerguel explained all the arrangements
to his principal. Then they drove to the
nearest cavalry barrack, where they had
acquaintances ; and that excellent fencer,
Monsieur Barbiche, received an hour's lesson
in the use of the sabre from the maitre d' amies.
But he found the weapon unwieldy, and he returned
to his hotel a sadder man than he left it.

Old General Pepper ate his lunch with
considerable relish. He was sick and tired
of home, its churches, its ruins, and its
priests. He longed, with an ardent longing,
for that paradise of retired military
men, " the sweet shady side of Tall Mall ; "
he longed, too, for the whist tables at the
Pandemonium, and his so-called friends at
that establishment, lie felt that if he only
got safely across the frontier lie would be
one of the lions of the season ; for he was
certain that the business he was bent upon

that afternoon would be no child's play.
He himself was no particular friend of Haggard's
; but he was proud of having done
his best for his man. " After all," said
he to himself, "it's six of one, and half-a-dozen
of the other. It's lucky for Haggard
that Spunyarn sent for me, or that cursed
Frenchman would have had his life to a
certainty, for the friend meant fighting ; I
could see it in his eye."

Such thoughts as these passed through
the worthy officer's mind as he carefully
packed his portmanteau. Then he paid his
bill. " Now," he soliloquized, " this is what
I call being sacrificed. Of one of these
fellows I know absolutely nothing, and
precious little of the other. But in the
cause of honour I shall probably have to
run half across Europe, and the worst of
it is, at my own expense."

Then the general started out to secure
the longest and heaviest pair of cavalry
sabres he could find in Ronie.

Haggard was equally active. He informed
his wife and her cousin that they must
leave Borne at once ; the convenient excuse
of an outbreak of cholera in the
city was a sufficiently valid one for the
ladies. By two o'clock Mrs. Haggard and
Lucy, their maid Hephzibah, and Haggard's
useful and polyglot valet, a Swiss, named
Capt, were en route for Geneva.

Business, my dear, will detain me here
till over tomorrow," said Haggard, as he
embraced his pretty wife upon the platform ;
but, please God, I shall see you then."
Perhaps his voice faltered a little, as the
possibility flashed through his mind that
perchance, in this world, he might never
gaze again into those loving, trustful eyes.
One more kiss at the carriage window
and the train started, for even Italian
trains must start at last. Haggard stood
gazing after the disappearing carriages.
Then he lit a big cigar and went back to
his hotel. Then, as a good man of business,

he made his will. It was short and to the
point. He left everything he had in the
world to his dear wife, Georgina Haggard.
He rang for a couple of waiters, who duly
witnessed it. And then from his pocketbook
he took a little packet of tissue-paper.
In it was a magnificent lock of
hair. Alas, its colour was other than the
deep chestnut bronze of George Haggard's.
He twined it round his linger, smoothing
its glossy threads, and then he carefully
dropped it into the hottest part of the
wood fire which smouldered on the hearth.
It curled and twisted in the embers as if
it had been a living thing ; a puff of smoke,
a pungent odour, and it was gone. Haggard
flung himself upon the sofa, and then
he slept the dreamless sleep of a little child.
Punctually as the clock struck five,
Monsieur Barbiche's faultless brougham and
high-stepping horse drew up at the old
mill, the only building which remained of
the ancient village of St. Sterno. The place

was well chosen. There was not a soul
about. Barbiche, his face still very pale,
dressed in spotless black, in his buttonhole
the red ribbon, so dear to every
Frenchman's heart, and accompanied by
his friend De Kerguel, stepped out. They
were followed by a little dried-up Italian
army surgeon, who carried under his arm
an ominous-looking black case. The made
for the miller's orchard at once.

They were not destined to be kept in
suspense, for Haggard and his party had
preceded them. All three Englishmen, Haggard,
the general and Lord Spun yarn,
were attired in ordinary walking dress ; the
general and Spunyarn advanced to meet
De Kerguel. Barbiche and the surgeon
remained a little apart.

Gentlemen," said De Kerguel, as he
courteously raised his hat, " we owe you
an apology."

General Pepper's ruddy face assumed a
purple hue. " Did these fellows mean to

cry off after all?" But lie was soon reassured.


We have thought it better," said the
Frenchman with a smile, " to avoid mixing
up any one else in this unfortunate affair.
Hence, gentlemen, we have dispensed with
the usual second temoin. Dr. Baptista,
of the Papal Zouaves, is present. We had
better perhaps lose no time."

Be good enough," said the general, " to
look at these." And from under his blue
military cloak, which lay upon the ground,
he drew a pair of regulation sabres, perhaps
a little exceeding the ordinary length. They
were heavy, murderous-looking weapons.

I cannot object, gentlemen," said the
Frenchman, as he carefully measured them

and weighed them in either hand. " But "

here he eloquently shrugged his shoulders.

The expectant adversaries lost no time.
They divested themselves of their coats and
vests, and, bare-headed, each advanced to
receive his weapon.

The general traced two lines on the
dusty earth, about eight feet apart. Barbiche
and Haggard took their places. The
old general stood between them, but a
little to one side ; he held his stick, with
the point raised a little from the ground,
ready to dash aside the blades the instant
that blood should be drawn.

En garde, messieurs" exclaimed De
Kerguel.

Both men put themselves at once on
the defensive : their blades crossed, but
the attitudes were different and characteristic.
Barbiche, drawing himself up to
his full height, raised his left arm while
standing face to face with his adversary,
brought the point of his weapon close to
his finger tips in salute, and then fell at
once into the regulation position of the
French fencing schools  the right foot well
forward, both knees considerably bent, the
left arm high in air, the elbow at a right
angle. He kept his sword pointed at the

eyes of his adversary ; but he never rested
for an instant. He evidently meant business.
Haggard, on the contrary, assumed
a totally different posture. His left arm
was behind his back, the hand clenched, the
right leg perfectly straight. He held the
sabre lower, but the point was kept unwaveringly
at the chest of his enemy ; his
teeth were set. On his face was that quasi-good
- humoured smile, which is alike assumed
by the British boxer and the British
ballet-girl when exhibiting their arts.

The Frenchman's blade scintillated in the
setting sun around Haggard's more stiffly
held weapon. As it grated against it, first
on one side then on the other, Barbiche
made pass after pass, feint after feint at
his impassive adversary. Suddenly he sprang
forward with cat-like agility, his left hand
touching the ground, and he made a rapid
pass from below upwards at the Englishman
; his point passed dangerously near
his ribs. It was the well-known extension

enseeonde; a favourite trick among Parisian
swordsmen of the Romantic school. The
attempt failed, and was followed by a rapid
succession of miscellaneous thrusts and
passes in bewildering variety. The Frenchman
never withdrew his blade ; but his
very anxiety to make a hit was defeating
itself. Such tactics with the light rapier or
small-sword are doubtless correct; but Barbiche
forgot the weight of his weapon, and
the muscles of his arm were already
beginning to tire.

As that experienced swordsman, General
Pepper, standing with stick extended,
viewed the fight, it seemed to him that
Haggard, by remaining purely on the defensive,
ran a considerable risk, but that
was Haggard's business. Perhaps after all
his principal meant to take a flesh wound,
and so end the matter. " But," thought
the general to himself, " he'll find out his
mistake, if that dancing devil gets in one
of his vicious thrusts." Spunyarn looked

on, and the perspiration streamed from his
face. De Kerguel was no less excited, but
he preserved a calm exterior.

More than two minutes had now elapsed
since the combat had first commenced.
These things take longer to tell than todo.
Suddenly, in an instant, Barbiche
made a furious lunge at his opponent ; the
Englishman parried it with ease, dropping
his point lower than usual. As if blind
to the consequences, the Frenchman
rushed forward with a short sharp cry,
his sword passed across Haggard's chest
without touching him, but poor Barbiche
had literally impaled himself on his adversary's
extended weapon. His sabre
dropped from his hand. He flung both
his arms high in air, giving one bitter
shriek. His face assumed the expression
of one enduring intense torture, and then
was calm again. The body, for he was
dead, slipped off Haggard's sword in a heap
at his feet. Haggard flung his weapon to

the ground, and all four men crowded
round the corpse.

He is stone dead," said the surgeon.

There was a solemn silence.

Save yourselves, gentlemen," at length
cried De Kerguel. " I will see to my unfortunate
friend. It was his own fault and
mine" he said with a sigh.

The Englishmen saluted. Haggard resumed
his garments, and they hurried from
the field, unobserved and unmolested.

Next morning Eome rang with the affair ;
by noon all three Englishmen were safely
over the frontier.

THE VILLA LAMBERT.

Twenty-four hours at a Genoese hotel
were got through by George and her
cousin without difficulty.

44 1 do think," said Lucy, " that Eeginald
might have brought us here himself. I
confess that a tete-astute of two women is
dull ; when they are almost sisters, as a rule
it's duller still ; though the dulness is frequently
enlivened by a pitched battle.
George, why are you not of a pugnacious
disposition ? My fingers literally itch to
box some one's ears ; as for Hephzibah, I've
no patience with her."

"I noticed that you had set her crying
again, Lucy, for about the tenth time
to-day."

And serve her right, she's over head

and ears in love with that priceless jewel,
your husband's man ; it's as plain as the
nose on her face, and there's no doubt of
the plainness of that. I know the symptoms,
they are unmistakable : they always
are, among the ministering classes. He was
Capt before, now it's ' Mr. Capt' here and
4 Mr. Capt' there. Mistering is always the
first sign, George. No, I've no patience
with her at all. It appears he gave hera
thermometer about a week ago ; she has
carried this thing about in her pocket ever
since ; the mercury has got separated, and
she passes her whole time in weeping and
shaking the horrid thing, and trying to get
it back again. Xow I ask you, George,
just look at her."

A mirror, turned towards an open door,
disclosed the lovelorn Ilephzibah in the next
room. Her proceedings were sufficiently
grotesque. In her hand she held a small
ornamental thermometer ; she would shake

it violently in the air, she would then
vol. i. 17

regard it intently with a puzzled expression,
then she would shake her head and
proceed to furiously agitate it once more.
Failing in her purpose, she wept bitterly.
Good-natured as Georgina was, she could
not resist a smile.

Hephzibah, you fool, come here," cried
Lucy.

The maid at once secreted the thermometer
in her bosom.

"Why do you hide the nasty thing?"
said Lucy.

Oh, miss, I'm ashamed."
"And what are you crying for?"
Please, miss, because of the omen."
What do you mean ? " said Georgina ;
do calm yourself, Hephzibah."

Oh, miss, only look," cried the girl, as
she took the scientific love-token from its
hiding place; "the quicksilver have separated,
never to be re united, and isn't that
an omen, miss?" Here the maid shook
the thermometer with redoubled fury.

' You stupid creature, so you believe in
all that nonsense, do you ? "

I may be stupid, Miss Lucy, but I've
never known a sign or .omen fail. Didn't
the cook at The Warren, miss, predict,
with coffee grounds, that I should be
engaged to a foreign gentleman, but that
some one younger and more beautiful
would prove a jealous rival ? Here I am
engaged, miss, or as good, to Mr. Capt ;
and I know what this omen means. You
may laugh, miss, but it's a very serious
thing."

I shouldn't wonder at all, Hephzibah ;
the hotel prospectus says there are no less
than fifty chambermaids here. Perhaps
even fifty jealous rivals."

Mr Capt don't demean himself to chambermaids,
Miss Lucy," retorted the abigail
with angry scorn.

Oh, I've no doubt Capt is ambitious ;
perhaps he looks higher. Perhaps I shall

be your rival, Hephzibah."

172

You wouldn't have the heart to do it,
miss," said the girl in all seriousness.

Mrs. Haggard gave her cousin a reproving
glance, but Lucy imperturbably continued
:

"Well, Hephzibah," she said, "I think
you may consider yourself safe from meat
least ; but I'll help you if you'll let me."

Ladies don't wink, they only imperceptibly
droop their eyelids, but the glance
that Lucy gave her cousin was terribly like
a wink, and brimming over with malice.

Yes," she went on. " Light that candle,
you stupid creature ; now hold your thermometer
close to the flame ; we shall soon
see what the omen is worth."

The maid did as she was bid, and carefully
watched the tube.

Well, are the separated fates getting
any nearer ? " inquired the young mistress
with affected solicitude.

Oh, miss, they are coming together
gradually, but very slowly, miss."

Get the thing nearer to the candle,
then."

Poor Hephzibah obeyed ; she little suspected
the heartless trick played at her
expense.

Oh, miss," she delightedly exclaimed,
they'll join in another instant."

Bang went the fragile bulb, as it splintered
into a thousand atoms, and the mercury
shot in sparkling globules over the
table.

Lucy's ringing laugh resounded through
the room.

But the matter was no joke to Hephzibah,
her pale lips became colourless ; she pressed
her hand to her heart with a gesture full
of anguish, recovered herself with difficulty,
gave forth a few short sharp sobs, cast an
almost menacing look upon her younger
mistress, then turned and rushed from the
room.

"How could you have the heart to
tease her so?" said George with honest indignation.

" I'm ashamed of you, Lucy ;

y

you've no right to trifle with her feelings.

o

Trifle with her fiddlestick," laughed
the girl.

But a knock at the door interrupted
them ; the discreet Capt entered, bearing a
telegram upon a salver.

Mrs. Haggard, to whom the envelope was

addressed, tore it open with some anxiety ;

her face assumed a pleased expression.

Order a carriage at once, Capt' she said.

The valet withdrew to execute the

command.

The telegram was from Haggard ; it was
as follows :

Spun-yam and I are on the road,
and shall reach Geneva by last train.
You had better go to the Villa Lambert
and arrange for taking up our quarters
there, if you like the place. All
well Br
George handed the paper to her cousin,
the latter clapped her hands with glee. Ina

woman's life there is nothing more
delightful than arranging a home, though
it be but a temporary one.

The girls hurried to prepare for their
drive. And Mrs. Haggard, after attempting
to soothe the wounded feelings of her
maid, directed her to accompany them.

"With Capt on the box, the young
wife and her cousin, and their still ruffled
attendant, started on the lovely drive alone
margin of the lake for the villa which
Haggard had secured, should it meet with
their mutual approval, as a home for his
wife and cousin during his short projected
necessary absence in America.

As seen from the lake the Villa Lambert,
which stood quite alone, gave one the idea
of the place a poet would choose for his
meditations. The villa and its terrace were
built of white stone, but a large portion
of the walls was covered with ivy. The
house itself was embedded in a thickly-wooded
garden where the trees were just

budding into leaf. Privacy was evidently
what had been aimed at in the arrangement
of the place. On looking at it one
would instinctively say, here is rest. A
large porte cohere, which had evidently
been long unused, was the chief entrance
to the place, and a small wicket, pierced
by a grille, and surmounted by a big bell
in an iron cage, was the only other means
of getting into the garden. The active
Capt descended, and seizing the substantial
handle rang loudly. The bark of a dog
was the only answer, but after repeating
the summons several times, the trap in the
wicket opened and disclosed the surly face
of an old Savoyard. The gifted Capt addressed
the old man in numerous dialects,
but no answering smile of intelligence
illuminated the sulky wooden face ; the
barred aperture was closed with an angry
slam, and Capt instantly recommenced his
solo upon the bell. Again the trap opened
and a weather-beaten crone answered his

summons ; at length the door itself was
unbarred, and Mr. Capt hastened to assist
his mistresses to alight. He explained to
them that the guardians of the villa were
a Savoyard and his wife, and that the
man was probably deaf, but that the
woman had expressed her readiness to
show them over the house and grounds.

The garden was full of trees and thick
with evergreen shrubs ; the walls covered,
as they are in most gardens on the
Continent, with carefully trained espaliers,
many of which were already white with
blossom, which promised an abundant
crop. Huge clumps of narcissus gave out
their heavy odour ; it was too early for
other flowers, save the China roses and
fuchsias, whose bright colours enlivened the
place. The beds were bordered, as in many
foreign gardens, by pieces of plank painted
a bright blue ; the paths, so different from
our hard trim English gravel walks, were
loose shingle, which had been carefully

raked. A goat, chained to a peg, grazed
on the unmown lawn ; the house itself was
jealously shut up, storm blinds and jalousies
covering every window.

The uncommunicative old gardener continued
his interrupted vocation ; his wife,
quitting the party and entering the house
by a back door, suddenly flung open the
windows of the drawing-room, and so
admitted the visitors.

There is always an air of discomfort
about a furnished house, a kind of grim
bareness that suggests an asylum or a
prison, rather than a home ; and in foreign
furnished houses this is specially apparent :
there are the regulation amount of chairs
and tables it is true ; if there are any
ornaments they are always either damaged
or in bad taste : they generally combine
both qualities. It was so at the Villa
Lambert ; but everything was spotlessly
clean, everything was scrupulously cared
for ; the chairs stood ranged against the

wall in a melancholy manner, cruel Philips
chairs and guiltless of cushions.
There were two hard formal-looking couches,
with straight backs and spider legs. There
was a sort of creepy look about the whole
place.

I wonder where the last proprietor
hung himself, dear ? " whispered Lucy in
her cousin's ear.

But from the rather dismal salon they
passed into a more cheerful room. As the
old housekeeper opened the shutters oneby
one streams of strong sunlight entered
the place ; the floor was inlaid wood, the
walls were panelled to the ceiling, and
elaborately carved ; the ceiling itself was
of polished wood, beautifully veined ; the
furniture was of oak, heavy and substantial;
attempt at ornament there was none,
nor was ornament needed, for from the
windows of this room one looked out
straight over the blue waters of the lake.
The cheerful sound of music came from

the deck of a big saloon steamer, bearing
its crowd of noisy tourists. On the opposite
shore, at Villeneuve, were the
wooded grounds of the hotel Byron ; Chillon,
a white spot in the turquoise sea, was
plainly visible to the right. The cousins
stepped to the open windows and descended
the flight of stairs that led from the centre
one ; it brought them to a little terrace
which overhung the lake.

Lucy clapped her hands with delight,
her more staid cousin w T as rapt in pleased
astonishment. In an instant the thousand
and one well-known descriptions ran
through her mind, and she thought of the
impassioned picture of the palace on the
Como lake, which Claude Melmotte had
poured into Pauline's delighted ear. Ought
she not to be happy ? Was not her handsome
husband the very ideal Claude?

Both girls were enthusiastic ; they spent
a long afternoon determining this, arranging
that. But spring evenings in Switzerland

are chilly ; Capt suggested their return
to the hotel. They reluctantly bade farewell
to the little villa ; but during all the
long drive back they talked of nothing but
the furnishing of the various rooms, the
things that must be had. the things they
could not do without. All this was argued
pro and con. ; colours were vital matters,
fashion equally important ; but not one
thought did the ladies give themselves as
to the cost. Happy girls, they were quite
right ; money in such a case as this was
no object. Lucky are they who have not
to count the cost, these are the people
who are the real privileged classes ; it's
easy enough not to count the cost at all,
in fact it's like a pleasant dream, a dream
which has an unpleasant awakening at
the shrill sounds of the piper who has to
be paid.

The girls sat up till midnight, at which
time Haggard and his friend were due
from Borne. The were both travel-worn

and had not much to tell. Their business
in Rome had been transacted. No, they
were not hungry ; they had dined in the
sleeping-car.

The next day, as gently as possible,
Hazard broke to his wife the fact that

Doit

was incumbent upon him to start at
once for his American property. The blow
came not unexpectedly, and George made
the best of it. But the husband stayed a
couple of days in Geneva ; there were
papers to sign in reference to the little
villa, a pair of ponies had to be bought ;
and the numerous little matters of business
to settle, which somehow or other it falls
invariably to the lot of man to transact.

The parting came at last ; it took place
on the platform of the station. There is
among women always a melancholy satisfaction
in seeing the very last of the
beloved object. George was no exception
to the rule. Spunyarn, who was to accompany
his friend, at a discreet distance was

laughing and chatting merrily with the
younger girl. True that at one time there
had been rumours of an attachment between
the pair ; we, who are behind the scenes,
know that both were perfectly heart-whole.


"Will the train never start, Lord Spun-yarn?
I'm afraid all this will upset my
cousin ; these partings are dreadful things
after all."

Think what my feelings must be, Miss
Warrender. I, who have been congratulated
by my friends over and over again in
reference to my supposed good luck, and
who will have now to face the fire of their
chaff at my cruel rejection."

Your lordship seems to bear it bravely
enough."

With profoundest equanimity, Miss War-render.
I leave the lady who has rejected
me, in maiden meditation fancy free, at least,
I suppose so ; that thought is balm to my
wounded soul. Hope, they say, springs

eternal in the human breast. Miss Warrender
may yet change her mind."

"She will not fail to let you know by
telegram should that unlikely event occur,
Lord Spunyarn."

"I'm afraid you've destroyed my future
peace of mind. I now shall never hear a
double knock with equanimity ; depend upon
it our time has not yet come."

Yours has at all events, Lord Spunyarn,
for if you don't get in you will certainly be
left behind."

Good-bye, then, Miss Warrender ; parting
is such sweet sorrow, I e'en could say goodbye
until tomorrow."

"Now that is very sweet of you. I little
thought you were Romeo still."

Now and ever, Miss Warrender," said the
young man with mock passion, as they laughingly
shook hands, and he hastened to enter
the carriage. "One thing I have forgotten,
though," he said, " don't let your cousin seethe
Society papers."

The parting between Haggard and his wife
was necessarily what such partings usually
are: it was painful to both; it would not be
amusing to the reader.

George's eyes were full of tears as her
husband embraced her for the last time. He
only tore himself from her reluctant arms as
the final whistle sounded from the engine.
As the train slowly moved from the platform.
the girls walked hurriedly along for a few
yards. Haggard leant from the window,
waving his hand ; his wife o-azed after the
vanishing train, standing like Niobe, dissolved
in tears.

Even Haggard, case-hardened as lie was.
didn't light his cigar for full twenty
minutes.

That evening Lucy Warrender obtained
with some difficulty a copy of 4 Tin 1 Sphen :'
tin is what she read there:

"Seldom indeed now-a-days do Englishmen
fight duels. In this they are wise, for with
us the man who fights a duel receives no

V)L. ]. 18

sympathy, and what is more unpleasant,
generally becomes an object of ridicule.
Sometimes, however, a duel is unavoidable.
We understand that this was the case in the
late unfortunate affair at Borne. The provocation
was given by the man who fell. M.
Barbiche was well known in London society.
As usual, the cause of the quarrel was a lady.
A correspondent in Rome, upon whose
information we can rely, informs us that a

blow was struck by Mr. R H , but

only after the grossest provocation. The
meeting took place within twenty four hours ;
unfortunately the result was fatal. The
survivor and the seconds of both parties
crossed the frontier at once, but one of
the friends of the deceased took the precaution
to draw up a process verbal of the
affair before he left, and transmitted it to
the authorities. Society in Rome has been
stirred to its foundations, for both the parties
were well known. The weapons were sabres.
We understand that the seconds of Mr. R

H , a well-known sporting nobleman and

General C , are, as well as their principal,

members of the P m Club. General

C is now in England."

To Lucy Warrender, who now heard of
the matter for the first time, these initials
were no enigma. The cause of Haggard's
mysterious detention in Rome, and of their
own sudden flitting, became at once clear
to her. " It was very thoughtful of Spun-yarn,"
she said to herself; "he was quite
right, George certainly shouldn't see
this'

The careful Lucy took every precaution.
The consequences of the incident at
Papayani's ball remained a secret to the
young wife.

The ladies were glad of the temporary
excitement of their move to the Villa Lambert,
which they made the day after the
departure of the two men. And now commenced
a life of seclusion and retirement,
which both of them enjoyed from its very

novelty. The old quiet life that they had led
at The Warren seemed to recommence once
more. They gardened, they drove out, they
rowed and sailed upon the lake, but they
declined all acquaintances. The life was
monotonous enough and devoid of incident.


Hephzibah Wallis had recovered her spirits,
her Swiss lover was more attentive than
ever ; he escorted her on a Sunday evening to
the Protestant place of worship, and though
she didn't understand a word, Hephzibah
enjoyed the service. In the mysterious rite
of " walking out " going to church together
forms an important factor ; it is the outward
and visible sign of " keeping company ; ,; it is
the inevitable step to being " asked in
church," a kind of probationary period, a
sort of trial trip. Mr. Capt was more
loquacious than the British man-servant,
under similar circumstances, would be. He
was never tired of drawing out Miss Wallis
on the subject of her young mistresses. The

juvenile escapades of the younger of them
were to him a source of endless amusement ;
he heard all that his inamorata had to tell,
nay his interest was so great in her artless
narratives that he would make her repeat
them over and over again. The Swiss soon
found out that in Hephzibah he was dealing
with a truthful girl ; for the tale, though oft
repeated, never varied. What girl has any
secret from the man she loves ? Hephzibah
Wallis formed no exception to the rule. But
it never dawned on her, at least not then,
that she was being " pumped' She put
down Mr. Capt's complaisance to his interest
in her ; and though, as servants will, she at
times asked him questions about his master,
she merely admired him the more when they
were dexterously parried, for the confidential
valet, in regard to Haggard, ever remained
discretion itself.

Great was George's delight when she goethe
first letter from her husband. Till now
they had never been separated; i< it to be

wondered at, then, that she locked herself up
with the treasure ? After the usual protestations
and the regulation amount of sentiment,
sentiment which, hackneyed though it was,
brought ready tears of pleasure into the young
wife's eyes, Haggard announced his immediate
departure by the mail steamer. " I'm off tomorrow,
George," he said, "for I find life in
London without you perfectly unbearable.
I am hastening my departure that we may
the sooner meet again," here followed several
sentences of the usual thing. The fact was
that Haggard found himself once more a
sort of lion in spite of himself, but he also
detected a rather chilling reception in many
quarters ; he was most gushingly received by
the least reputable of his lady acquaintances.
Mrs Charmington, in a long tete-tete with
which she had favoured him, had called him
her hero." But Mrs. Charmington was
already on the wane, and as he had no wish
to be her hero now he rather fought shy of
her. At the Pandemonium he was as popular

as ever, rather more so in fact ; fur since the
baccarat affair, particularly as he was away,
he had acted as a sort of scapegoat for the
sins of the many. It was rather a nuisance,
too, to find that wherever he went he excited
a considerable amount of attention. Even
when seated in the stalls of his favourite
theatres, those temples where the sacred lamp
of burlesque is so carefully tended, it was
annoying to find the glances of all those
airily-costume and magnificently-developed
females, who are known as the Loathes and
the Toties, concentrated on himself.

He had received no invitation to go down
to The Warren, but his father the Justice had
written him in no measured terms.

41 1 had thought," he said, " that by this
time you would have got tired of making
an ass of yourself; you'd better give old
Warrender a wide berth ; he is furious

All these things then tended to make a
long stay in town distasteful to Haggard,
so he went down to Southampton, took his

passage for Mexico in that magnificent steamship,
the "Capua," and he started, feeling
himself an ill-used man.

CHAPTER I.

AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS.

Seventeen uneventful years had passed and

had streaked George Haggard's abundant

chestnut locks with grey. A lovely woman

still. The innocent, healthful, girlish beauty

had developed into the sweet matronly

dignity which is so frequently seen among

the happy wives and mothers of the English

aristocracy. Haggard was still proud of

his wife, because even he couldn't fail to

see her beauty ; and as for the old lord,

he idolized her much as old Squire Warrender

had idolized her twenty sears ago at

The Warren. Georo-ie Ha<j\ard Alas not

demonstrative. Always quiet, she was
VOL. ni. 39

rather timid and subdued in her husband's
presence ; but with the old lord,
though perhaps a little more staid and
dignified than of yore, she was still the
lovely and affectionate woman of the old
happy times. Hers was the beauty of the
happy mother, the sweet matronly loveliness
which is perhaps the more touching when
tinged by the slight dash of sadness which
idealises it and saves it from the commonplace.
The smile was not ever present, but
it was none the less beautiful and touching
from its rarity.

Eeginald Haggard and his family had
been installed at Walls End Castle ever
since Lord Hetton's death. They had come
originally upon a visit ; Mrs. Haggard's
health had suddenly broken down, and at
the old lord's urgent entreaty the visit had
been indefinitely prolonged. Although Haggard
was, as we know, a wealthy man, lie
could not afford to disregard any suggestion
of his great-uncle. At first he had looked

OH the whole thing as a confounded
nuisance ; he had objected to his wife
that they might make themselves ridiculous
by a too abject obedience to the
whims of the old nobleman.

But after all it was not so very bad
for the Haggardss. Lord Pit Town took
care to make it very apparent to everybody
that it was at his special desire
that Haggard and his family remained at
the Castle. He let it be very plainly perceived
that he considered Reginald Ha'jard
almost as his son, as well as his heir ; for
the permanent Under-Secretary at the Home
Office, at the conclusion of his official
duties, had quite enough to occupy his
mind with his eternal whist at the club
till the small hours of the morning. The
odd trick was far more to him than the
possession of Walls End Castle and the Pit
Town title. But Mr. Lancelot Haorard
remained a plain esrjuire till his death,

which occurred seven years after that of

392

the unfortunate Lord Hetton. When his
man-servant opened the study door one
mornmcr for he had found the bedroom
empty, he saw Lancelot Haggard seated
at the whist table, upon which the four
hands of an unfinished game were spread.
Pole's "Treatise on Whist" lay open at "The
Echo of the Call," the candles had burnt
out in their sockets, there were tricks
turned, and three cards were already
played of another one ; and Lancelot
Haggard sat bolt upright, the fourth card
between his fingers, stone dead, but with
a peaceful smile upon his lips-reginald

Haggard, then, was practically
in the position of Lord Pit Town's son.
Of course he was but plain Mr. Haggard
still. He had got rid of his father's
place, thus " washing his hands," as he
had threatened, " of the whole bag of
tricks ; " for though Cunning-ham, the
Scotch steward, had succeeded in screwing
three per cent, out of the place, yet he

lead made himself so terribly unpopular
in the process that he resigned in despair
in order to emigrate to New Zealand, and
so become, as he phrased it, his " ain mon
a<2ain." When the steward resin-ned Haggard
had been very glad indeed of the
excuse to send the place to the hammer.
A set of rooms in the huge mansion of
the old lord in Grosvenor Square had
been placed at Haggard's disposal, and
though he frequently ran up to town, his
pied-parterre was at the house which would
one day be his own, and the Haggardss
had no regular establishment in London.
As for George Haggard herself, she invariably
passed a portion of the summer with
her father at The Warren. She usually
made her annual visit accompanied only
by the two boys, for Haggard invariably
absented himself in the summer either for
Norway fishing, lengthy yacht voyages, or
as one of a little party of men of his
own kidney, who sought their sport further

afield and went lion-hunting in South
Africa, shooting the hippopotamus on the
White Nile, or chasing the fast-disappearing
buffalo upon the American prairies. But
as a rule he would set home for the shooting.
Year by year the head of game in
the Walls End preserves, under Haggard's
fostering care, had increased. In the old
lord's name Haggard had invited every
year a select little party of crack shots ;
he gave them a couple of days' hattue
shooting, the other four in the stubble
and among the turnips, and at the end of
the week they went away to " wipe each
others' eyes " over some other man's birds.
For some years the bags made at these
little annual gatherings had been noted in
the daily papers. Haggard himself not
infrequently headed the list, for he was an
enthusiastic sportsman and a brilliant shot.

Eeginald Haggard at five-and-forty had
quieted down. Years and years ago he
had taken his name off the books at the

Pandemonium ; he no longer gambled, and
he took a great interest in politics, as
became a man who was destined, in the
ordinary course of events, and at no very
distant date, to become one of our hereditary
legislators. Of course Haggard had
many friends, or rather acquaintances, all
of whom were ready to kootoo and truckle
to the man who would be the next Earl
of Pit Town ; men whom he would invite
to dinner, and who would entertain him ;
generally men of his own age, or club-room
bucks with wrinkled cheeks ; men whose
clothes were always in the fashion, and
who as a rule ate and drank rather more
than was good for them ; men who rode in
the park on three hundred guinea hacks,
and who might be seen in the Drive in
big mail-phaetons with brobdignagian lamps,
or driving noisy and rather miscellaneous
parties on their four-in-hands towards
Richmond.

I don't know what Haggard would have

done without that invaluable esquire of
his body, Mr. Maurice Capt. Capt accompanied
him everywhere ; he had camped
out with him in the Cockles, and his culinary
skill there had more than made up
for the deficiencies of Bull-headed Bill, the
half-bred titular cook of the expedition.
Capt was a silent man, and his fellow
servants were never able to extract any
gossip from him respecting his master's
wanderings. But Haggard was lucky in
retaining one real friend ; his old nidus
Achates, Lord Spunyarn, was his friend
still ; still a bachelor, no longer the unsuccessful
amateur athlete of former days, but
developed into a full-blown philanthropist,
the friend of mankind in general, but of
the destitute East-ender in particular.

Ever since George Haggard, in her just
indignation, had banished her cousin from
her presence, Miss Luc} Warrender, still
a handsome woman, had led a wandering
life ; the dove had found no rest for the

sole of her foot. Homeless and friendless,
though her intimates and acquaintances
were innumerable, she was as restless and
erratic in her movements as the Wandering
Jew. Miss Warrender was always in
evidence upon the Ascot Lawn ; she was
to be seen at Brighton during the season,
at German watering-places, at Danville,
Biarritz, and Eastbourne or Scarborough
in the summer, and occasionally even fora
few days at The Warren, where she invariably
appeared at Christmas. For Lucy
Warrender had eight hundred a year of
her own, which she had inherited from the
colonel, her father. I am afraid she had
become a confirmed old maid ; she had
flirted and philander till she was thirty,
and there were plenty of the very smartest
people who were quite ready to flirt with
her now, for Lucy Warrender still retained
]her good looks, her dreamy blonde beauty,
and her eyes still sparkled as of old. We
have said Lucy Warrender was homeless

and friendless, and she had developed two
master vices : to drown her troubles she
gambled as only a woman can gamble,
and she drugged herself with chloral and
other abominations to procure a temporary
forgetfulness of a black shadow that incessantly
pursued her. The man Capt
knew of the long-buried secret, and he
persistently blackmailed the unhappy Lucy
Warrender ; but Capt was far too wise a
man to kill the souse with the golden efTs.
He considered that if he drove her to extremity,
and the trick which had been
played upon Eeginald Haggard should ever
become a public scandal, that he had nothing
to gain but everything to lose. He
knew that the English laws against what
the French call change were severe ; he
also knew enough of his master to be quite
certain that if Haggard's just indignation
were once aroused, he would be pursued
with relentless ferocity. So he contented
himself with plundering Lucy Warrender,

and kept her secret ; not because he was
not perfectly ready to betray it, but because
lie saw no way of bringing his knowledge
to a better market.

As for the two young men, for they had
already ceased to be adolescence, they were
certainly physically decidedly above the
average. Lucius, the elder, was, as we
know, Lucy Warrender's child. His whole
soul was wrapped up in the fact that a few
short years would see him the possessor of
the courtesy title and heir to his supposed
father's ample means and old Lord Pit
Town's incalculable wealth. The longfellow
had even developed a taste for art.
simply because he felt it was his bounden
duty to be able to appreciate the innumerable
treasures which must inevitably soon
be his very own. Young Lucius Haggard
had been petted and spoiled from his
earliest infancy, he had had his way in
everything ; his nurses, his schoolmasters
and his tutors had bowed down to him ;

good-looking young fellow that he became
in after years, a fact of which he was perfectly
aware ; he was flattered and toadied
to by the golden youth of both sexes, and
by most of his elders, who ought to have
known better, to an extent sufficient to
have turned the head of any ordinary
young man of wel-regulated mind. But
Lucius Haggard's was not a well-regulated
mind. He was of his father's religion, but
he carried the religion further. Eeginald
Haggard was a self-worshipper, a man determined
to get the greatest amount of
pleasure and amusement out of this world,
regardless of consequences to others, a man
fer whom trumps were continually turning
up, a man who felt he was a brazen pot
amono the earthen ones floating' down the
stream, and to whom the annihilation of the
weaker vessels was a matter of utter indifference.
Like Napoleon, he believed in
his star, and he had been right in doing
so, for when at two-ands twenty he  had

been turned out to take this chance, he
had rapidly become the possessor of wealth
far beyond his needs ; a little later, after
a short period of enjoyment of the free
wild life in America, he had returned to
draw the prize in the matrimonial lottery,
which somehow inevitably falls to the lot
of such as he. The good lives which stood
between him and the Pit Town peerage
had all dropped, and nothing now remained
between him and what he considered his
rights but one frail old man. But the
young Lucius had never for an instant
been submitted to the healthy influence of
even temporary poverty, his existence had
never even been troubled by so much as a
crumpled rose leaf; the consequence was
that his selfishness was utter and unaffected,
that he did not even wear it as a fragment,
but that it was absolutely a part of himself.
A tall handsome young fellow enough,
fairly clever, who did not conceal that he
thought himself rather superior to the rest

of the world, and the rest of the world
took pretty good care to coincide in the
young fellow's opinion.

As for George Hasforard. he was the anti

CO

type of Lucius. Equally good-looking, he
was the picture of old Squire Warrender
in his youth ; his fair chestnut hair curled
m profusion over his broad square forehead.
He was a muscular youth who
shone at school and at the university, in
the cricket field and upon the river alike.
But he was no mere athlete, for he had a
taste for reading, and he never forgot the
fact, which his father was continually pressing
upon his mind, that he, as a younger
son, would have to get his own living.
And George Hafroard was ambitious ; he
meant if possible to force his way into
the arena of political life, and had already
determined to make a struggle for name
and fame at the Bar. But though George
Haggard was ambitious, his was an affectionate
disposition ; he idolized his mother,

and he truckled to no one, not even to his
father or the old earl. George Haggard
knew well enough that he would be a
comparatively poor man  a pauper, as his
brother pleasantly put it, but only a pauper
from the point of view of Lucius Haggard,
the probable future possessor of immense
wealth, for The Warren acres would assuredly
be his, and had George Haggard
so willed it, nothing would have been
easier for him than to sit and twiddle his
thumbs and wait for old Squire Warrender's
death; but as we have said, George
Haggard was ambitious.

The great new gallery at Walls hand
Castle, the Grecian temple which Dr. Wolff
had designed over twenty years before, was
now less offensive to the eye externally. It
was a Grecian temple still, but its 
had passed away. Two old
gentlemen arm-in-arm slowly walked down
the principal saloon, the one a big gre}'-
haired man whose face was disfigured with

many scars ; as lie walked he gesticulated,
and he spoke with a strong German accent
in a loud voice. By his side ambled his
friend and companion of many years, a
very old man this, who stooped considerably
and leant frequently upon a crutch-handle
stick ; the two men were John, Earl
of Pit Town, and Dr. Wolff.

I never thought, Wolff, that I should
be spared to fill the last space on these
walls. I certainly never expected to sec
the termination of my labours. In art one
cannot be too exacting. We made up our
minds years ago that there should be nothing
doubtful here, and here is the only
remaining space filled at last, and filled,
as it should be, by a masterpiece. Yes,"
said the old nobleman, as he rubbed his
hands, " thank heaven there is nothing
doubtful here. Nothing remains for me
now, Wolff, but to leave the treasures that
it has been the labour of my life to accumulate
; mv sicht isn't what it was."

Xo man is what lie was, my good friend
and master, but it is not well to be sad.
You set yourself a freat task years aio,
an almost superhuman task. He is accomplished."


No, not accomplished yet, Wolff. I
have only got through a part of it. I have
caught my white elephant, but what am I
to do with him? I know too well that
my natural heir looks upon the contents of
these galleries but as so many hundred
thousand pounds' worth of hard cash. He
is an honest man, and makes no secret
of it."

But his son, my lord, the young Mr.
Lucius ? "

Ah ! he is a mystery, Wolff, that I have

failed to fathom. We have known him, my

friend, since he was a little child. I can't

tell why, Wolff, I have never trusted him.

Perhaps the aged are over - suspicious. I

confess to you that if I thought he loved

art for art's sake, he should have my
VOL. ni. 40

pictures, as lie will ultimately have my title
aud what goes with it."

You cau tie them up, my lord."

Yes, I know I can tie them up, but
then the pictures I've loved would suffer.
Who will care for them, Wolff, when you
and I are gone ? "

You have sometimes talked, my
lord, of giving them en Hoc to the
nation."

Yes, Wolff, I did once think of that ;
but since that time I have seen that real
Chamber of Horrors, the National Portrait
Gallery. I should not like to send
her there," he said, as he pointed to the
portrait of wicked Bab Chudleigh, who
simpered and smiled at him from the wall.
No, Wolff, I shouldn't like my pictures
to be hawked about as loans to one East
End or provincial exhibition after another,
to be sneered at by crowds of appreciating
yokels. It's a very heavy responsibility,
Wolff."

At this moment Eeginald Haggard entered
the gallery.

I hear, my lord," he said, as he shook
hands with the old nobleman, " that you
have hung the last long-sought ti-easure
this morning. Is it really so ? "

The old lord nodded.

"I suppose you will begin the weeding
process now ? " continued Haggard.

The old man drew himself up a little
stiffly. " If you can indicate to me anything
that is unworthy, you will confer an obligation
; but I think you'll find it difficult. In
my opinion, Haggard," he continued, " and
in the opinion of others far letter able to
judge than I am, tiers is nothing here
requiring weeding out."

Haggard slightly flushed.

I can only plead my ignorance," he
said ; " it is what most connoisseurs do."

Yes, there you're quite right ; but most

men begin collecting as the amusement of

their old age. I began it sixty years ago,

402

and I'm afraid my long life's labour is over,
and that, useless old man that I am, I've
lived too long already."

You look upon things in a melancholy
light, my lord."

"No man is pleased when he finds his
occupation gone ; and perhaps it's a little
sad to me to find that you care for none
of these things."

I know you wouldn't wish me to affect
an interest I do not feel," said Haggard
with an ingenuous smile.

No, there you're right. For we should
find him out, shouldn't wee, Wolff?"

The doctor of philosophy laughed. " It
is our business to detect shams'' he said.
Yes, I think we should have found you out."

Then, Dr. Wolff, you'd better try your
skill on Lucius ; he poses as a man of taste,
I don't.'

At that moment the two young men
entered the gallery.

Here he is to answer for himself," said

Haggard ; " and I'll leave him to your tender
mercies. If he be a sham Priest of Art,
unfrock him by all means, Dr. Wolff," said
Haggard with a laugh, as he sauntered
away.

The two young men greeted their aged
relative with respect, and nodded familiarly
to Dr. Wolff.

I verily believe, my lord, that this
younger brother of mine has no soul'' said
young Lucius Haggard ; " he actually tells
me that the contemplation of pictures produces
in him naught but headache."

And a pain in the neck, Lucius ; don't
forget the pain in the neck," said his
brother.

"Yes, his pain in his neck was his other
symptom. He declares he sees more beauty
in a sunlit rustic hedge than in a landscape
by Claude Lorraine."

And I added to my criminality, I fear,
Dr. Wolff, by declaring that I only liked a
picture when it gave pleasure to my eyes,

as does the wicked wanton on the wall
yonder," he added, kissing the tips of his
fingers to Mistress Barbara Chudleigh.

"Each, my young friend, do not glory in
being a Pilasters'' sighed Dr. Wolff.

I fear, George, yours is but a low and
sensuous ideal, if Sir Peter's commonplace
masterpiece is all that rouses your enthusiasm.
Why, amidst so much that is beautiful,
so much that is spiritual, so much
that appeals to the higher nature, you
should pick out the one commonplace bit
in the whole collection, I can't imagine,"
said Lucius with a sneer.

You may call it commonplace if you
like, Lucius. All I know is, that whatever
else she may have been, if Bab Chudleigh
was like that picture, she must have very
closely resembled an angel."

And have you seen them then, these
angels, young sir, that you speak so confidently
? " said the German doctor, as a great
smile ran over his scarred face.

Seen them? of course I have  hundreds
of them. So did you, Dr. Wolff, when you
were ray age, and I have no doubt so did
his lordship there," said the boy with a
glance at the old lord, who was peering
into a picture at some distance. " I'll be
bound that Lucius here sees the angels of
this dream-fancies by the dozen. He goes
in for poetry, you know, and all that sort of
thing, though I for my own part would
rather not see his angels, for I haven't been
educated up to the pitch where one admires
the beauty of decay, as Lucius has, the
creatures with the pointed chins, the sandy
townley hair, the great hungry eyes, the
uncomfortable poses, the deficiency of
adipose tissue and the prehensile toes. I
can't say that I appreciate green shadows
under the eyes, nor do I see anything poetic
in a bilious air. But all these things are
very dear to Lucius, at least lie says so.
No, give me nature and Tab Chudleigh,
and I'll make Lucius a present of art and

his bony angels, and all Mr. Swinburne's
clutching horrors into the bargain."

'' Thank you, George ; it's very noble and
generous on your part to hand over to me
what you can't appreciate."

My dear Lucius, we all have our failings.
You go in for art and the artificial, while
nature is enough for me."

When you are my age," said Lucius
with the superior wisdom of an elder
brother, " you will cease to judge by
externals, I trust. You will have learned
to peep behind the veil, and you will seethe
real soul seated on its throne."

Bosh ! " said George shortly.

And so the idle talk went on, and Lucius
continued to pose, while the worshipper of
nature took pains to fit on the Philistine's
skin tighter than ever.

AT MONTE CARLO.

Mk. Maurice Capt, thou oh an ambitious
man and a clever one withal, had risen no
higher in the world since we saw him last ;
he was still Eeginald Haggard's valet, but
his cases were eood and he had a little den
of his own where his meals were served
to him from the housekeeper's table in
solitary state. The valet was by this time
a man of property ; his wants were few and
his little economies, as he called them, were
large. Nobody but his banker was aware of
the extent of his accumulations ; he couldn't
have saved it all out of his pay, but he had
managed to amass a comparatively large
sum which stood to his credit in four figures.
Was Mr. Capt a gambler, a backer of horses,
or a dabbler in stocks and shares ? Nota

bit of it. Mr. Maurice Capt was the proprietor
of a secret. For seventeen years
Mr. Capt had drawn from this queer property
of his a varying but comfortable income.
When Lucy Warrender first came into her
eight hundred a year, Mr. Capt's income
had very sensibly increased. It wasn't paid
quarterly or half-yearly ; the manner in which
it was drawn was sufficiently original. The
bills which Mr. Capt drew whenever he
thought fit upon Miss Lucy Warrender where
always honoured. Mr. Capt was in the
habit of writing to the lady in the humble
tone of a suppliant. The letters always
stated with praiseworthy clearness what was
the sum required, and the demand was always
met with business-like promptitude. How
Miss Warrender managed to satisfy this insatiable
bloodsucker I cannot tell, for though
she had eight hundred a year of her own,
she certainly lived up to it, perhaps beyond
it. But Miss Warrender gambled in many
ways ; she speculated and had (suite a large

iiccoLint which she had opened with a very
old friend of former years, Mr. Dabbler,
once of the firm of Sleek and Dabbler, but
now trading by himself, and though dropping
his h's as freely as ever, one of the biggest
brokers on the Stock Exchange and an alderman
of the City of London. I suppose
Alderman Dabbler must have been very
much in love with Miss Warrender, though
he never actually had the impertinence to
propose to her. Iter transactions with him
Averse numerous, and did not pass through
his books. Most of her speculations were
made upon his advice, and many a handsome
cheque testified either to the astuteness of
Miss Lucy Warrender, or to the generosity
of Mr. Alderman Dabbler. Poor Dabbler,
he was but one of the many irons in Miss
Warrender's fire. Miss Warrender betted ;
it was even said that she ran horses as " Mr.
Simpson." She would stand upon the plateau
at Monaco at the shooting matches, and in
an entrancing costume and a pair of ten-button

gloves, lier face carefully shaded from
the blazing sun by an enormous parasol,
she would watch the birds fall right and
left and die in agony, or drop wounded into
the sea, and still continue to back the bird
or the gun, as seemed to her good, with
the cosmopolitan habitues of the rather
Bohemian but money spending set in which
she moved. It was a very miscellaneous
set : peers, members of parliament, journalists,
jockeys, people who lived by their
wits but who somehow always managed to
wear new garments of fashionable cut,
actresses, singers, dancers, of European reputation,
and some of them with no reputations
at all, fashionables of enviable notoriety or
the reverse ; all these various sorts of people
were hail-fellow-well-met with Miss Warrender
upon the Plateau at Monte Carlo, or
within the walls of the great gambling house.
Lucy Warrender had kept her good looks ;
I expect if she hadn't she would have gone
under long before. She enjoyed herself ina

sort of feverish way ; she was a notoriously

lucky woman when she gambled, and she

gambled habitually and heavily. But just

on the particular day we meet Miss Warrender

again, Fortune had been unkind. The

lady was sitting gazing out from her window

on the second floor of the Hotel de Eussie

upon the sunlit tranquil turquoise sea. I don't

think that she saw much beauty in the scene,

for though she stared at the blue sea and the

bluer sky, she appeared to be rapt in thought.

There are some women who are always

well dressed, whose flounces and whose

furbelows are ever fresh and crisp ; Lucy

Warrender was one of these. It would be

very easy to extract from The Queen a poetic

description of the pretty pale blue tea-gown

that Lucy Warrender wore, but I must

leave it to your imagination, reader. The

pale blue and the profusion of delicate filmy

lace suited Lucy Warrender's dreamy blonde

beauty. Seventeen years had passed lightly

over her head ; perhaps the golden locks were

a trifle more golden than of old, and if
their luxuriance was due a little to art, the
secret was only known to Lucy and her maid.
Her foot, thrust into a heel-less Tunisian
slipper of blue velvet embroidered with seed
pearls, beat the floor impatiently. The
strong sunlight showed that there really
were a few tiny wrinkles, faintest lines on
the ivory forehead and at the corners of the
pretty mouth, whose ruddy lips were arched
like Cupid's bow. But though the lips were
arched, the mouth was determined, almost
cruel; but the cruelty of the mouth suddenly
disappeared as the door opened, and the
whole face was instantly illuminated by the
smile that men termed infantine and angelic,
but which rivals of her own sex styled
affectedly sentimental.

It was Lucy's maid who entered the room,
a big burly woman, still the fine animal of
yore, Fanchette  the Fanchette who had
succeeded the unhappy Hepzibah, and who
had nursed the boys Lucius and George.

I have got them, mademoiselle," she said
in French, as she smoothed out a little heap
of blue bank notes ; " seven thousand francs
as usual ; and a brave pair of earrings too,
to produce lliat from the harpies of the Mont
de Piece at Nice. The employe made me the
usual compliment, mademoiselle, and as he
paid me the money he declared that the pair
of single stones were the most beautified he
had ever seen. The rascal took care not to
say it till we had made our bargain. Ciel,
I trust mademoiselle will be en veine tonight,
for I shan't feel easy till I see the
stones sparkling again in mademoiselle's
ears."

Lucy counted the notes, she dismissed the
bonne, and then she soliloquized ; not in so
many words, as do heroines of melodrama,
but this is what she said to herself, at all
events the substance of it :

I am sick of life, I am sick of planning
and plotting and being looked upon as an
adventuress. I am sick of being bowed to

and spoken to by people who in the oil
time would not have presumed to beg for
an introduction. I am iettinof declassee.
Perhaps one doesn't feel it so much here,
for wee are pretty well all adventurers more
or less, here in the gambler's paradise, though
some of us have plenty of money." Miss
Warrender stood before the smouldering
hearth and gazed with stern scrutiny at her
own features in the mirror. " Yes," she
soliloquized, " George, though she is two
years older than I am, has certainly worn
the better of the two ; she is lovely Mrs.
Haggard still. And what am I? A hag, a
dreadful grinning hag, a woman to be flirted
with, danced with and supped with, a woman
who has ceased to be respected. Why, that
dreadful old Baron Teufelsdroch called me
his belle petite the other day, and I have no
champion now to take the old sinner by the
throat and shake the life out of him."

Lucy sank into the only comfortable chair
in the room, and then she did a dreadful

thing. Dreadful to our minds, dear reader,
for we are respectable and insular and we
have our prejudices, our glorious insular
prejudices. We can sympathize with "The
Sorrows of Werther," we can even shed tears
perhaps over the bread-and-butter cutting
Charlotte, but were Charlotte to light a
cigarette ! Oh horror  fie  for shame 
pschutt : the lady would at once be outside
the pale of respectability, totally unworthy
of our love and sympathy ; worse still, to
our minds she would cease to be even good-looking
or to deserve the lovely and romantic
name of Charlotte at all. One can't tell why
it is so : the preternaturally hideous heroes of
our fashionable lady novelists seek consolation
in the strongest and most expensive cigars
or in rough cut cavendish. Dirk Hatteraick
even places a quid of pigtail in his mouth,
and that bold buccaneer and the heroes of
the lady novelists still remain dear delightful
darlings, and bright eyes grow dim over
their hairbreadth escapes, their struggles

VOL. HI. 41

and their woes. Spare then a little of your
sympathy for poor Lucy Warrender, that
bankrupt rake, as she coiled herself up in
the big easy chair and took from her pocket
a tiny silver case and extracted a Lafernie
cigarette. Remember, reader, that Fanchette,
you, and I, are the only accomplices of her
guilty weakness. She took an ember from
the fire with the tongs and lighted the little
cylinder, and as she did so her features
once more, as of old, became lighted up
with the soft placid smile of girlish enjoyment,
as the angel face became surrounded
by a halo of tobacco smoke. Why shouldn't
poor Lucy seek consolation as did the other
villains and heroes of romance ? It evidently
wasn't the first cigarette by many that Lucy
had smoked, for she inhaled the smoke
scientifically and ejected it from her nostrils
like an hahiiuee.

Nemesis sooner or later finds the sinner
out, and when we called Lucy Warrender
a bankrupt rake it was done advisedly, for

Miss Warrender had come to the end of her
tether. The earrings which she had pawned 
a sordid act, for they had been a love-token,
the souvenir of a reckless, wicked and unhappy
attachment  were literally the lady's
last stake. She took the little roll of notes
from her pocket and methodically counted
them once more.

So this is the end of it all," said Lucy
to herself ; " a few dirty pieces of paper
and that is all. And if I lose them all tonight,
as something tells me is but too likely,
then I must be a beggar, and must stretch
out my hands for alms  or bid good-bye to
all the bright sunshine and the happy, pleasant
memories," and she laughed a hard bitter
little laugh. " But why should I be sorry
to go? Happiness is not for such guns as
I have been. My secret has been well kept,
so far, but will it be a secret long ? For I
can't afford to pay for silence now. If I
land a heavy stake, or break the bank, all

will be well : if not, I must go where I

412

hope to find forgetfulness. But what if
there should be no forgetfulness beyond the
grave ? " As her thoughts dwelt on the
words she shuddered. " The cold, cruel,
silent grave. Silent ! Yes, that was something
 and after  if there be an after." And
then the thought of the happy girlish days
at The Warren came back to her. The remembrance
of the stupid faithful people she
had known, and liked, and laughed at, and
then the dreadful time at the Villa Lambert
and Avhat followed ; and then her own
triumphantly - successful trick  successful,
perhaps, from the very simplicity of its
audacity ; and then her weary worthless
after-life, with its sickening treadmill round
of so-called gaiety and amusement. And
then the child ; why lead he not died ? It
was for no love of her child that, by her
agency, young Lucius had been foisted into
the position of Haggard's heir. She had
thought no further than to hide her shame,
and in doing it she had unwittingly disinherited

her owu cousin's child. Why had
Lucius not died?

Lucy's melancholy meditations were disturbed
by the entrance of Fanchette, who
handed her mistress a letter and left the
room as silently as she had entered it. Lucy
recognized the hand, and knew full well what
the letter would certainly contain. She had
guessed aright. Another demand for money
from the man Capt. The words were respectful
enough, there was no threat, but
Lucy Warrender understood what it meant
the money or exposure.

A thousand pounds ! As well might the
daughters of Danaus try to fill their sieves
with water, as Lucy Warrender attempt to
satisfy the insatiable greed of the remorseless
Capt. Miss Warrender placed the letter
in the hire, and saw it consumed to ashes.

' Unless I win heavily," she thought, " you
will not be gratified, Maurice Capt. Then,
I suppose, you will try your master, but I
fancy you will have a bad quarter of an hour

with liim."' The thought gave her evident
pleasure ; it even made her smile.

And then she darkened the room, and
flinging herself upon the sofa lay down to
sleep away the hot afternoon till it should
be time for dinner and the subsequent
roulette.

Eight o'clock saw" Miss Warrender in a
charming toilette of electric blue. The little
bonnet with its short curing feathers did not
hide the great wavy masses of golden hair ;
the little cape with its fur trimming, and the
tiny rauiF, even the gloves and the boots,
were of the same colour. As Lucy Warrender
entered the Eooms she smiled, and lie
talked with several of her acquaintances.
That hoary old sinner. General Pepper, Cab.,
bowed profoundly to her, and paid her his
old-fashioned c omplimen t.

Devilish pretty little woman," he remarked
to his friend Colonel Spurbox, late
of the Carabineers ; " knew her years ago in
Eome. Wears well and don't look her age.

Those little plump fair women never do.
Gad, she's not got her earrings on ; sent
them to her uncle's, I suppose. She'll
go for the bank, Spurbox, to-night. Plucky
little devil. I hope she'll win."

The eyes of the two warriors gazed after
the retreating maid with sympathetic admiration


'' Crisp little thing, eh ? " continued the
general.

Monstrous," echoed his comrade, with
ready acquiescence. "Let's go and drink
her health, and then we'll go into the thick
of it and see how she 2:ets on."

The two old bucks ambled off to drink
Lucy Warrender's health ; they wished her
well. Much good may it do her.

As Miss Warrender walked towards the
great room where the worshippers of the
Goddess Fortune most do congregate, the
big suisses, in their handsome liveries and
chains of office, Sowed obsequiously ; they
all knew her as an habitude and a constant

customer of the tables. When she reached
the roulette table itself, that veteran diplomatist,
one of the oldest and most faithful
of her admirers, the Due de la Ilouspignolle,
offered to vacate his chair, with many a
protestation and a succession of courteous
bows.

"I have been unlucky, dear Mademoiselle
Warrender ; Fortune has frowned on me,
but now I am far happier, for I exchange
her frowns for the smiles of Yenus."'

"I won't take your chair, duke," said
Iaicv. "I may lean upon it, and try to
be your Mascotte and to bring you luck."

But somehow or other, whether the
pretty Englishwoman's presence upset the
old gambler's calculations or not I cannot
tell, but he lost, and in a quarter of an
hour rose from his seat.

Revenge me on the Philistine, dear
lady, if you can," said the old man, " for
I am decade  but don't take my unlucky
chair, I pray you. You will ? " he continued

in astonishment. " Well, if you will
you must ; at all events take my card, it
may help you'' and he handed her the
little card with the big black-headed pin,
by means of which the experienced players
mark and register the exact result of each
successive coup.

Lucy Warrender took the chair with a
smile, and laughed gaily, as with the card
she received a little tender squeeze from
the wicked old hand, and then she sat
down with a full determination, as the
Americans put it, " to plank down her bottom
dollar." Lucy Warrender was sitting
next to the croupier. She handed him one
of her thousand-franc notes and he gave
her in exchange a little rouleau neatly
sealed at both ends, containing the equivalent
in gold. For nearly three-quarters
of an hour Miss Warrender confined herself
to stakes of one or two Napoleons at
a time, which she pushed out before the
little glittering pile in front of her, and

which were placed upon the decked square
with wonderful rapidity by the obsequious
croupier. It is a curious fact that your
croupier, that well-paid but honest official,
for some mysterious reason or other always
mentally identifies himself with the bank ;
it gives him absolute pleasure to rake in
the winnings, and he feels some strange
vicarious twinge of agony when he commences
the process of paying out. But
whenever Miss Warrender won, this particular
croupier pushed her gains towards
her with a little smile, and strange to say
didn't seem to feel it in the least. And
now Lucy looked at her card. For twenty-seven
coups she had placed a single Napoleon
upon the number twenty-seven.
Of course, at roulette, some number or
zero itself is bound to come up every
time, but number twenty-seven was invariably
unlucky. Lucy Warrender's left
hand was thrust into the pocket of her
dress ; it clutched, as an Ashantee warrior

clutches his fetish, the key of her room at
the Hotel de Passive, and from the key
hung its little brass label  it was number
twenty-seven. For three-quarters of an
hour then, and for twenty-seven coups. Miss
Warrender had pursued her Will-o'-the-wisp ;
the one or two Napoleons that she staked
each time was mere child's play to lier, for
as we know she was in the habit of gambling
heavily. At the twenty-eighth coup
Miss Warrender changed the amount of
her stake upon the unfortunate number ;
for the twenty-franc piece she substituted
a hundred-franc note and handed it to the
croupier ; he thrust it into the great glass
and metal cash-box at his side and pushed
five Napoleons on to the square marked
twenty-seven. "Messieurs, le jeu est fait.
Rien ne va j>lus,' said the bald-headed high
priest of the table, who sat exactly opposite
the gentleman with the rake, who had so
deftly carried out Miss Warrender's directions.
He seized the big plated handle, gave

it the necessary twirl as he said the words,
and tossed the little ball of fate, with the
usual professional spin, upon the rapidly-revolving
disc. Found flew the wheel of
fortune, and round flew the ball, making
little irregular jumps. As the whirling disc
revolves less rapidly, every eye is fixed
upon the ball. The wheel is about to stop.
The ball jumps into 15, thence into 17.
The wheel has almost stopped ; the ball
will surely rest in No. 23. No, it has not
quite stopped, it goes a little further yet.
Heads are craned forward. Lucy Warrender
clutches the key of her bedroom tighter
than ever. And then the bald-headed high
priest uf Baal calls out in the regulation
monotone, " Vingt - sept. Rouge Impair et
Passe r' Rhadamanthus, Minos and lacus
stretch out their rakes, and gold, notes,
and fat five-franc pieces, which have been
staked by the unhappy backers of black,
even, the zero and the various numbers
(all but twenty-seven, lucky twenty-seven) are

swept away in an instant Then the croupiers
cover the stakes of the lucky backers
of odd and red with their equivalents ; nothing
remains on the table now but fortunate
Lucy's five Napoleons. The croupier at
her side gives it the little professional knock
with his rake, sweeps the five Napoleons
back towards Miss Warrender, and counts
out to her from his cash-box, with unerring
rapidity, the sum of three thousand
five hundred francs in notes. There is a
little hum of applause. "Faite-s vos jeii.v,
messieurs'' Down rained the notes, the
Napoleons, the British sovereigns and the
five-franc pieces, and the game continues
with monotonous regularity.

For three mortal hours Lucy Warrender
clutched her hotel key, and played with
varying success. At one time there was
quite a little heap of notes and gold in
front of her, upon which lie discreetly
laid her fan. She had steadily backed the
number twenty-seven for varying but ever

increasing amounts. The number twenty-seven
had come up no less than eight
times and had been the cause of Miss War-render's
winning heavily. The keenest eye
at that time coukl have detected no wrinkle
on Lucy's lovely girlish face. But fortune
after a while caasei to favour her ; the
crowd of admiring onlookers, " the gallery,"
that had stood behind her cluiir attracted
by her successes gradually dwindled, and
the heap of gold and notes in front of her
slowly but surely took unto themselves
wings and flew away. But the gouty old
Frenchman, the Due de la Houspignolle,
faithful knight that he was, still stood
behind her chair. Old Pepper and the
veteran Colonel Spurbox, of the Carabineers,
still leered at her, in mingled pity and admiration,
from the other side of the great
roulette table. Lucy Warrender still clutched
her key, and still backed fatal number
twenty-seven ; her mouth was dry and
parched as she took out her last thousand-franc

note, and, it not being permitted to
stake that sum at roulette, she took it to
the Trente et Quaraiite table, and lost it at
a single coup.

The lady had played her last stake and
lost it. She rose to leave.

Let me be your banker, dear Miss
Warrender," whispered the aged Mephistopheles
who stood behind her chair.

Xo, duke, not that. I haven't quite
sunk to that yet, you know."

' Always farouche, dear Miss Warrender,
but I apologize," he continued as he gave
her his arm.

Perhaps the little hand that rested on
it trembled slightly, but Lucy was a War-render,
and plucky ; she nodded and bowed
in every direction ; she smiled and simpered
as sweetly as of yore ; she sat in the great
restaurant at one of the little marble tables
and sucked an orangeade glace through two
straws, and then the Due de hi Ilouspignolle
escorted her back to the Hotel de Eussie

with all respect, where Fanchette anxiously
awaited her arrival.

Fanchette didn't ask her mistress how she
had prospered, for her gesture as she flaccidly
dropped into her lounge-chair told the
woman all she wished to know.

You can go, Manchester'" said Lucy ;
if I want anything I'll touch the hand-bell."


The woman yawned, courtesies and departed.


Lucy Warrender opened her writing-case
and commenced an affectionate letter to her
uncle. In it she said incidentally :

There are quite a number of people
here that we know. The old Due de la
Houspignolle, still quite the old beau ; and
that dreadful old General Pepper, the man
we met at Eome, and who was mixed up in
Eeginald's affair with poor Barbiche, and
Colonel Spurbox. They talk of making up
a party to run across to Nice. I think
of joining them. If we go we shall leave

the day after tomorrow ; everything of
course depends upon the weather. I "

Here Lucy Warrender deliberately let
her pen fall upon the paper. Then she
got up, looked at herself in the glass and
frowned ; and then she did a thing she
hadn't done for years. She knelt down at
her bed-side and said her prayer to heaven,
the very prayer she had been accustomed
to say as a little child upon her nurse's
lap. Then she took a printed receipt of
the Mont de Piece for a pair of brilliant
solitaire earrings, and burnt it in the flame
of the candle.

No one will miss me," she muttered
to herself, " no one, save Maurice Capt,
for I have been an income to him, and
George, perhaps. Poor George ! " she added
with a soli. She ne'er even thought of

o o

Lucius ; she knew full well that even had

the youth known she was his mother, he

would assuredly not have missed her.

I wonder whether the old duke will
VOL. in. 42

be there," she continued to herself ; " all
the English are sure to come. We never
miss a funeral ; it's one of our sad pleasures,"
she added with a hollow laugh. Then she
took from her dressing-case a dark blue
fluted medicine bottle ; it was labelled,
'the sedative mixture, a teaspoonful fora
dose at bedtime. POISON." The last
word had a little special red label all to
itself. The bottle was nearly full. Miss
Warrender deliberately poured out seven-eighths
of its contents into a tumbler, then
she recorded the bottle, replaced it in her
dressing-case and swallowed the contents
of the tumbler at a draught, and then
carefully and deliberately washed the glass
and dried it with the towel. Then she
sat herself down in the lounge-chair. In
ten minutes she dozed ; she soon slept
peacefully and calmly. In half-an-hour she
had ceased to exist.

On the 23rd inst., at the Hotel do
Eussie, Monte Carlo, Lucy, the only

daughter of the late Colonel George Warrender,
of the H. E. I. C. Service, aged 35,
suddenly of heart-disease."

This was the first intimation to Lucy
Warrender's friends in London of her
sudden death.

Poor thing ! " said Mrs. Charmington,
now quite the old woman, " I wonder how
she managed that lovely-coloured hair."

AN ANONYMOUS LETTER.

Mrs. Haggard and her husband, both in
deep mourning, sat in the special boudoir
at Walls End Castle which had been furnished
and set apart for his grand-nephew's
wife on her first arrival years ago by old
Lord Pit Town. Haggard looked pale and
weary, and well he might, for he had gone
straight to Monte Carlo and had come straight
back, stopping only forty-eight hours there,
just time enough to lay Lucy Warrender
in her grave. He had not gone alone ; at
his wife's insistance he had taken the
young Lucius with him. He had been
astonished at the determined manner in
which George pressed this arrangement
upon him ; he yielded, though with a bad
<]jrace. When he reached the Hotel de

Eussie, both he and Lucius liacl declined
to look on the fiice of the dead woman.
Haororard had a \oii<y interview with
Fanchette, and then he called upoji the
Commissary of Police. The night before
his mother was laid in her crave, Lucius
Haggard, unknown to his companion, who
was shut up in this room writing, visited
the Eooms, won a couple of thousand francs,
and thoroughly' enjoyed himself.

The next day the two men stood by the
side of the shallow grave ; graves are
shallow in Monaco, for the ground is very
rocky. A wandering English clergyman, of
more than doubtful reputation, gabbled
through the service for the burial of the
dead. The stones and bits of rock rattled
upon the coffin with a hollow sound, for
the orave-diosfer didn't trouble himself much

D DC

about the feelings of the relatives of the
foreign heretic.

I think my aunt Lucy went oil' tremendously
in the last year," said young

Lucius to his companion as they left the
cemetery.

"Let her rest, boy, let her rest," was
all the answer he got.

There was a sort of grey look of horror
about Haggard's face, that the boy put
down to grief for the departed. He was
a hard-hearted youth, and was frankly
surprised that Haggard showed any feeling
at all.

The husband and wife, as we have said,
sat in George's boudoir. This was what
passed between them.

Your cousin seems to have made a nice
mess of it," said Haggard. " Why she was
penniless."

Well, that wouldn't much matter,
Eeginald ; she could have written to Courts'
for more."

Gad, they write me that she drew out
the last farthing she had in the world two
months aso. And that woman Fanchette,
who is a very bad lot indeed, or I'm very

much mistaken, told me lie pawned her
earrings the day before she  died."

George nodded. " I remember them, a
pair of large single-stone earrings. I fancy
she must have bought them when she first
came into her property. I saw them quite
by chance last summer, for the first time ;
and when I admired them, she said that
she had had them for years, that they had
been her first folly and had cost her dear."

Well, here they are at any rate," said
Haggard ; " she pawned them for seven
thousand francs, and I redeemed them after
a lot of bother. And that's all that remains.
She had spent or gambled away every farthing
of the rest. I don't know whether I
ought to tell you, George," he continued
in a softer tone,

Tell me, Eeginald, tell me what ? Did you
know ? " and the light of love came back
into George Haggard's eyes, as she thought
that perhaps her careless heartless husband
had, from a wish to shield her cousin's

honour, silently and deliberately allowed
poor Lucy's bastard child to be fathered
upon him. But the light quickly faded,
and the eyes were suffused with tears, asher
husband answered coarsely :

Did I know what r I knows this  she
poisoned herself, there's not a doubt of
that."

And then, without the slightest attempt
to soften the ghastly details, he brutally
told his wife the particulars of her cousin's
end.

"They manage these things much better
there than here," he said. "Twelve Tom
Fools are not called upon to sit in one's
dining room and give their opinion. The
Commissary of Police had the whole matter
cut and dried. I saw the official doctor
too  a hungry fellow that. Of course I
had to bribe the pair of them. Lucy
Warrender poisoned herself, George. She
did it artfully enough, with chloral. Yhy,
they showed me the bottle ; she had swallowed

enough to kill half-a-dozen women.
What a fool she was, when one comes to
think of it ! Why, she could have married
well any number of times, if she'd liked ;
she could have had Spunyarn years and
years ago, if she had chosen to Hft her
finger. What a fool she was ! "

Yes, that was her epitaph : " What a
fool she was ! " You couldn't have put it
more tersely and more truly, Eeginald Haggard.
What a thoughtless wicked fool she
had been ; she had wrecked her own life
and her cousin's by her wicked folly.
What a fool she was ! "

I verily believe that if Haggard had
shown one spark of feeling in the matter
of poor Lucy's death, his wife would have
spoken, after a silence of twenty years ; but
his last words had checked the impulse, and
George merely nodded, while the tears rolled
down her cheeks, as she silently accepted
the justice of her husband's verdict.

As she sat and pondered over her cousin's

soiT} ending, she felt that the least she could
do for the dead girl was still to jealously
guard her miserable secret.

While the elders were talking, the two
young men were walking in the great avenue
that for nearly half a mile runs from the
principal entrance of the park to the big
hall door of walls End Castle. Lucius had
much to tell ; he was full of the journey,
and he went over all the details of the
funeral to the younger man.

Rattling good place, that Hotel de
Eussie ; they gave us an uncommonly good
dinner, and ortolans. I didn't think much
of them, but the governor was very enthusiastic,
and ordered them again for breakfast.
By Jove ! George," continued the young
fellow, "he's so fond of them that I believe
if mother, or even I, were to die tomorrow,
the governor would order ortolans for breakfast
if he could get them. I say, George,"
he added, " I'm in funds, and I don't mind
doing the generous thing, if you like. I

know you're hard up  beastly hard up 
you always are. I'll make you a present
of a pony, George "

Young George Haggard smiled, and took
the five-and-twenty pounds, in crisp banknotes,
which his father's heir produced from
his waistcoat pocket. " 111 take it as a
loan, Lucius," he said with a little laugh,
to be repaid when I become Lord Chancellor."


All right, my boy," said the other.
Now if you can keep a secret, I'll tell
you how I got it." And then he went off
into a long description of the great Temple
of Fortune on the shores of the Mediterranean.
How he had retired early, on the
plea of fatigue ; how he had escaped undiscovered
to the Eooms ; how lie had
backed his luck and won his money.
"Eighty pounds wasn't bad for a first
attempt, you know," lie said. '' 1 saw old
Pepper," he continued, '' in the thick of it ;
but I had to keep dark, you know, for I

shouldn't have cared for the old boy to seeme
there."

George still held his brother's welcome
present in his hand, and the boy twisted
the notes nervously in his fingers. lie
hesitated, but not for long.

Don't be offended, Lucius," he said ; " I
think I'd rather not take it, if you don't
mind."

"As you please, my boy," said the other,
holding out his hand willingly enough. ' As
they say in the schools, Non olet.""

"It does to me, Lucius  it does to me."

The young men continued their walk up
and down the great aisle of old beech trees,
and Lucius returned to his ecstatic description
of the scene in the Halls of Dazzling
Delight ; but I don't think the other young
fellow heard him, for he was thinking of
the dead woman who was sleeping in her
lonely grave.

Lucky Lucy ! dead a week, and you have
two human beings who still mourn your loss.

I always thought you were a fool,
George ; but you really are a bigger fool
than even I ever took you to be. I actually
hand you five-and-twenty pounds, which you
decline with thanks. I don't understand
you, George. You neglect your opportunities.
Why don't you make up to the old
man, or cultivate a taste for art, as I do ;
I mean to make art pay, my boy."

"Well, you see, Lucius, it might be awkward
if his lordship found me out. I'm
afraid I find more pleasure in walking up
and down this big avenue and staring up
at the rooks, than in spending my time
in the Pit Town galleries."

Oh ! I see ; Child of Nature, and all that
sort of thing. Why don't you go in for
being a poet, George ? It's the only real
business that I know of suited for a
thorough-paced fool, though as a rule it
don't pay."

Simply because I'm not a humbug, my
boy."

You might do a good deal with a rhyming
dictionary, you know ; particularly if
you let your hair grow."

"I don't think there's much poetry about
me, Lucius. I like the air, and the light,
and the green leaves, and those black chaps
who hop about from branch to branch,
and who look like a lot of disreputable
parsons, all preaching at once about nothing
at all."

Oh, I see, you admire the beauties of
nature. Now I look upon this old avenue
from quite another standpoint. Sooner or
later it'll be mine, and all the rest of the
pomps and vanities too, I suppose  the plate
and the pictures, and the title, George. Yes,
there's something in a title. But they're a
precious long while coming."

Don't be a brute, Lucius," was all his
brother replied.

While the two young fellows carelessly
talked and smoked in the great avenue,
old Lord Pit Town sat in his study and

]held a momentous conversation with
Georgia's husband. Eeginald Haggard stood
before the fire looking exceedingly uncomfortable.


' I wish you'd be candid with me,
Haggard. Was there any informality about
your marriage with Georgina?"

'' Good gracious, no. What makes your
lordship hint at such a thing ? "

That I will explain to you directly.
In the meantime answer me honestly ; don't
forget that as the head of the family I stand
in the position of a father to you. Anything
you may say to me will of course
be between ourselves. Can you assure mc,
as between gentlemen, that you made no
previous marriage? Was there any such
entanglement in America ? "

It seems to me that your lordship is
asking me to say that I am an unmitigated
villain. Still, to satisfy you as the head of
the family, I give you my word that nothing
of the sort ever occurred. Of course like

most young fellows 1 Lave made a fool of
myself with dozens of women, or rather
perhaps they made a fool of me. I sighed
and dangled, perhaps I even hinted at
marriage. Doubtless I was a young idiot,
like most young fellows of my age, but my
peculiar form of idiocy never developed
itself in a matrimonial direction."

I'm uncommonly glad to hear it,
Eeginald, for I have been uncomfortable fora
day or two, and now that my mind is at
rest, you shall see what caused my apparently
indiscreet questions."

The old lord opened a despatch-box which
lay upon his writing-table, and taking from
it a letter, handed the document to his
heir. Haggard seated himself, opened the
letter, and read it carefully through. It
was a strangely written manuscript on
ordinary thick note-paper. If the writer
had intended to prevent any attempt at
identification, he had thoroughly succeeded.
The precaution he had taken was simple,

but sufficiently ingenious. Your ordinary
anonymous letter writer is content to slope
his writing the wrong way, or if very acute
he uses his left hand ; but the expert, if
placed upon his trail, generally succeeds in
detecting some peculiarity sufficient to
identify heir The writer of the letter which
Lord Pit Town handed to Haggard was
evidently a man of originality, for the
letter and its address were not written ina
running hand, but in carelessly printed
Eoman capitals.

As Haggard perused the letter his brow
grew black as night, but when he had
ended it, he tossed it with a contemptuous
laugh upon the table.

Here is the letter verbatim :

MY LORD,

I address you to let you know that

I AM POSSESSED OF INFORMATION WHICH WILL ENABLE
ME, SHOULD I FEEL SO DISPOSED, TO ENTIRELY ALTER
THE SUCCESSION TO YOUR TITLE AND TO UPSET ANY
DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR PROPERTY THAT YOU MAY
MAKE. I AM PREPARED TO SELL TO YOU THE Information
FOR THE SUM OF 0000. I MAKE YOUR LORDSHIP
VOL. III. 43

THE FIRST OFFER, SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU
WILL AT ONCE SEE THE WISDOM OF ACCEPTING IT.
SHOULD YOU DECIDE NOT TO DO SO, I SHALL STILL
GET MY PRICE, THOUGH I MAY HAVE TO WAIT TILL
YOUR LORDSHIP'S DEATH. LITIGATION WILL, OF COURSE,
ENSUE, AND A DISGRACEFUL SCANDAL WILL BECOME
COMMON PROPERTY. SHOULD Your LORDSHIP FEEL
DISPOSED TO LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL, A
LINE ADDRESSED TO 103b, BROWN'S NEWS ROOMS,
CHEAPSIDE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT. THE FACT OF MY
NOT ASivING FOR PAYMENT FOR MY INFORMATION
UNTIL I HAVE GIVEN IT SHOULD BE TO YOUR Lordship
A SUFFICIENT GUARANTEE OF ITS GENUINENESS."

What can the fellow mean ? " said the old
lord. " Can Hetton have contracted a secret
marriage ? "

Haggard shook his head. " It's probably
a mere vulgar trick to obtain money," said
he. " Shall yon see the fellow ? "

It would, perhaps, be better that you saw
him, Reginald ; you are as much concerned
as I am, nay more so. Make an appointment
to see the man in town. I will write to him,
and if the secret he alludes to be genuine it is
cheap at the money, if it were only to prevent
expensive litigation and the worse horror

that he hints at  the dragging of our name
through the mire."

So it was arranged. A letter was dispatched
to 193 B, making an appointment for the
astute writer of the letter to see Mr. Eeginald
Haggard upon a certain day at the old lord's
house in Grosvenor Square. Eeginald Haggard
sat for a whole hour waiting in vain.
Nobody came to him with a mysterious
communication, and at the end of a week
both he and the old lord had dismissed the
matter from their minds as an impudent and
stupid hoax.

To the mind of the shrewd reader the name
of the writer of the anonymous letter is no
mystery. Mr. Maurice Capt had been seriously
disappointed when, for the first time in
his life, one of his applications to Lucy War-render
had been unsuccessful. But Lucy
Warrender was now beyond his reach. Capt
felt aggrieved ; he considered that his demands
upon Miss Warrender had been excessively
moderate, and he felt a sort of pride in

432

the fact that he had kept her secret so long
and so cheaply. But now Lucy Warrender
was dead, and the contract between Capt and
the lady at an end. Mr. Capt, when he wrote
his rather ambiguous anonymous communication
to the old lord, had thought the matter
well out ; he had made up his mind not to
reveal the nature of what he had to tell until
he had the old lord's promise to let him have
the sum he demanded. For Mr. Capt well
knew that it is possible to provide even
against extraordinary contingencies ; he knew
that there were such things as family treaties,
and he knew that his threat, if he could only
get Lord I'it Town to believe in its genuineness,
would be only terrible to the old man
by its rendering him practically incapable of
disposing of his property, and leaving the
very succession to his title in doubt. Mr.
Capt was sharp enough to know that if once
he had the old lord's promise, the five thousand
pounds was as good as paid. But Mr.
Capt had a holy horror of two things. The

one, which he dreaded with a natural terror
of the unknown, was the criminal law of
England ; the other was a desperate fear of
the wrath of bis Eecrinald Hacrorard. For
once his master had lost his temper with the
valet. It was nearly twenty years ago now
since Reginald Haoard, in a moment of
indignation, had literally thrashed Mr. Capt
within an inch of his life, and though it was
twenty years ago Mr. Capt's bones still ached
with the remembrance of that tremendous
beating. So that the suggested interview with
Haggard entirely upset all the valet's well-arranged
plans. Could he but have had a
private conversation with the old lord, and the
required promise, he felt that he would have
proved his case up to the hilt, and thus have
obtained what he looked upon as the honest
reward of his long silence. But though a
clever man, Mr. Capt was a coward, and he
feared to face th fury of Lord Pit Town's
heir.

The valet repeatedly turned the matter

over in this mind, and found it a very complicated
question. Of course, the one person
in the world to whom the secret was most
valuable was young George Haggard. The
facts had but to be published to the world
and George would jump at once from the
precarious position of a younger son into
that of the direct heir to an earldom and the
property of a man of enormous wealth, while
as for Lucius, he would become but the
nameless blow of old Warrender's niece.
But there were several disturbing influences
to Mr. Capt's calculations. To neither of
the young men could he sell his secret for
money down. This was a very serious consideration
indeed. As for George, he might
decline to do business at all, from loyalty to
his mother ; while as for Lucius, Mr. Capt
well knew that it was impossible to trust him.
The valet at length determined that he would
sound young George Haggard upon the matter,
and having made up his mind, proceeded
to. do so at the first opportunity.

Mr. Capt had not long to wait, for he
encountered the young fellow in one of his
solitary rambles in the park, and seeing that
they were secure from interruption, plunged
at once in medias res.

Young George Haggard was seated upon a
stile meditatively gazing upon the landscape,
when he was roused by a slight cough behind
him, which proceeded from his father's discreet
body servant.

Halloa ! Capt," said the youth good-naturedly
; '' enjoying the beauties of nature?"

Yes, Mr. George ; one can't well help it
in such a lovely place as this."

I suppose ordinary people like you and I,
Capt, don't appreciate it as we ought. That,
as my brother tells me, requires culture. He
would doubtless see more in it than we do,
being a man of culture, as he is, you know."

Perhaps the old place, sir, may look all
the pleasant to him, for in the ordinary
course of things, you see, sir, he must come
into it some day or other. That must be a

very pleasant thought, sir," added the valet
after a pause.

"Well, I'm not so sure about that, you
know ; there are lots of responsibilities, you
see," and the young man proceeded to fill his
pipe philosophically.

You may come into it yourself, sir, one
of these days, who knows ? " said the valet
in a carrying tone.

Young George Haggard started, and stared
at Mr. Capt, who seemed to him to have
slightly forgotten himself.

Stranger things than that have happened,
sir," continued the Swiss.

Well, you see, my man, as my father and
Mr. Lucius  to say nothing of his lordship) 
would both have to go to the wall first, it
doesn't seem a likely contingency. And do
you know I don't think it's quite the thing
to talk about, Capt."

But the valet was not to be put down.

Anyhow, it's a great position for so
young a gentleman as Mr. Lucius," insisted

the man. " Many a man has sold his
soul for less than that," he continued, as he
gazed admiringly at the Castle, which occupied
the centre of the peacefully romantic
landscape.

Young George Haggard stared at the valet
in undisguised astonishment. " Fellow's been
drinking," he thought ; " he seems strangely
impertinent, that accounts for it."

Ah, they manage things differently, sir,
in my country. It's share and share alike
there. My father, sir, had seven sons, and we
each of us took an equal share of his little
bit of land as a matter of right."

Well, perhaps, Capt, that's what they'll
do here when England becomes a republic.
But I don't think that it'll happen in my
time, and I don't think I could persuade
Lucius to go halves with me."

Seeing that the young man was disinclined
to continue the conversation, the valet
touched his hat respectfully and took himself
off.

It is a highly respectable thing to be a
landowner ; the freeholder has many advantages,
but getting rid of the property, particles
in the present day, is as a rule both
difficult and expensive. Mr. Capt was like
the proprietor of an Irish estate ; far from
being able to dispose of it at a reasonable
figure, he was unable to obtain even an offer
for his secret, and it was a valuable secret ;
but then, though a white elephant is a
valuable animal, it is not an investment
that most people would care to hold, and
Mr. Capt's property now seemed indeed buta
white elephant. Had it not been for his
holy fear of his master he might have
attempted to make terms with Mrs. Haggard,
but his terror of Lord Pit Town's heir was
extreme and had become a second nature
to him.

The love of home is specially developed
among the honest and economical inhabitants
of Switzerland; like the Scotchmen they quit
their dear native land young, in the hope

of making their fortunes ; but unlike the
Scots they inevitably return to the Fatherland
With the results of a life of industry, and this
Alas the dream of Mr. Capt's life. Like a
wise man, finding he could not get a cash
purchaser, he determined, though very much
against his own inclination, to make a bargain
with young Lucius Haggard at the earliest
opportunity ; but he knew that if he trusted
to the honour of Lucy Warrender's son he
would be leaning upon a broken reed, and he
walked back to the discharge of his duties at
the Castle in a state of considerable depression.


-*>-'i, n-

PALLIDA MORS.

It was the second of September. Eeginald
Haggard's usual invitations had been accepted
by a select party of his intimates. They had
had a great slaughter in the well-stocked
Walls End preserves on the day before.
General Pepper, Lord Spunyarn, Colonel
Spurbox, the host and the two 3'oung men
sat down to breakfast, and George Haggard
presided at the meal, looking to Spunyarn's
mind handsomer than ever in the deep
mourning which she still wore for her cousin
Lucy. But Mrs. Haggard was not the only
lady who graced the breakfast-table at the
Castle, for Mrs. Dodd had arrived to pay
a long-promised visit the day before, of course
accompanied by her husband. As some men
never travel without a hat box, so Mrs. Dodd

never left King's Warren without the Rev.
John.

I am so glad to have met you once more,
Lord Spunyarn," said the vicar's wife ;
isolated as I am at King's Warren, it is so
seldom my privilege to meet any man having
a purpose in life, and the men with a purpose,
you know, are after all the only men worth
knowing." Here she gave a benignant and
comprehensive glance round the table, and
every one felt that he at least was not worth
Mrs. Dodd's notice, which was exactly the
sensation the vicar's wife intended to
produce.

Awfully good of you, dear Mrs. Dodd, I'm
sure, ]put I'm afraid I can hardly claim the
credit of being a man with a purpose. I
went to the East End first, you know, merely
from curiosity and because the people were
excessively amusing, but nowadays ' slumming'
is the fashion and a great many smart
people I know do as I do, merely for a new
sensation."

All, you do good by stealth and blush
to find it fame," said the lady.

I don't know if you can call it coin(
good. I give very little of my money away,
though I certainly do spend a good deal of
my time among the abjectly poor. I became
a sort of confidential adviser to a good many
of them, a kind of honorary amateur solicitor.
I drifted into it somehow or other. I acted
as a sort of buffer between the East End
Lazarus and his landlord I was instrumental
in obtaining for Lazarus certain rights
which had been long in abeyance in the East
End ; either my client didn't know his rights,
or he found them difficult to enforce ; the
landlords would screw the uttermost farthing
out of the poor wretches in the shape of rent,
and if they didn't pay they were sold up.
The quid pro quo they gut for their rent
was simply a place to rot and die in  no
water, no drains, no ventilation, no anything.
Then there was the sweating system ; women
working fifteen or sixteen hours a day fora

pittance of nine pence : Tvomen doijig
men's work and getting next to nothing for
it ; and the attempted redress of a thousand
and one nameless grievances and horrors."

"Oh, Lord Spunyarn," cried Mrs. Dodd,
'' would that I could walk hand in hand
with you through those dreadful places,
sharing in such work."

"I have no doubt Dodd could exchaiiije
and become one of the wise men of the
East, if he tried," said Haggard maliciously.

Ah, dear Mr. Haggard, my husband was
never formed for missionary work. Ever
since my girlhood I have tried to rouse his
enthusiasm, but in vain. I don't believe he
has any enthusiasm," and here the voice
of the Eeverend John Dodd was heard in
an unctuous whisper addressing Colonel Spur-box
in commendation of the dish in front
of him, to which lie helped himself copiously
for the second time.

I'm quite certain, my dear sir, that there
is no more successful way of accommodating

the freshly killed partridge than in a salmi.
I say this advisedly, and after many years'
experience. I speak feelingly, colonel. Till
the fourth you can't do better than stick
to salmi; I always do."

There's no want of enthusiasm in that,
anyhow, Dodd," said Spunyarn with a
smile, while the two young men laughed
aloud.

Ah," sacred the vicars in a stare
whisper, " forgive his little weakness ; he will
hanker after the flesh-pots  the flesh-pots
of Egypt."

Be exact, my dear, be exact," cried the
vicar ; " it was quail, probably roast quail,
though that is a succulent dish, that is
referred to ; certainly not salmi of partridges."


"Don't trifle, John," cried Mrs. Dodd.

I don't, my dear ; I assure you that I
am seriously, profitably and pleasantly employed.
Good gracious me, is there anything
one need be ashamed of in the admiration

of art? And what art can be higher than
the culinary art, which must have been necessarily
one of the earliest, if not the very
earliest of all ? Some people are born without
an ear for music ; I am one of those
unfortunates myself, but to make up for it
I have been blessed by heaven with an
appreciative palate. Would you have me
neglect my advantage, would you wish me
to bury my one talent in a napkin? Certainly
not, Mrs. Dodd. Art I appreciate, especially
high art, and Til trouble you for a little more
of the salmi. Dr. Wolff."

And iiow are things going on in the
parish, Mr. Dodd ? " said George. " Are the
Dissenters as active as ever?'

No, my dear madam ; just now the Church
is far more popular."

Thanks to organization, thanks to organization,"
burst in the vicar's wife impetuously.
"' Our curates' wives arc admirable organizers.
You remember the Misses Sleek, Mr.

Haggard?"

VOL. III. 44

'' That I do ; uncommonly good-looking
girls they were too."

Well, Mr. Haggard, it was the last thing
that I should have expected, but they both
went into the Church."

"You mean that they married my curates,
my dear," interrupted the vicar.

No, Mr. Dodd, I said it advisedly, they
went into the Church. I suppose that in the
old days when high-born ladies became nuns
that they went into the Church, and in doing
so vowed themselves to a life of self-denial.
And in this present time any lady dio
marries a clergyman, Mr. Dodd, vows herself
to a life of self-denial and penance, and
certainly enters the Church. I did," she
added with a sigh, " and I glory in it. The
humble curate may rise to rank and title, butin
the highly unlikely event of your becoming
a bishop, John, I should remain plain Mrs.
Dodd still."

"Not plain, my dear not plain."

But Mrs. Dodd did not condescend to

reprove him ; she forgave the flippancy of the
remark for the sake of the compliment.

"The fact is," said the vicar, "that
since that fellow Smiter left King's Warren
a great many of the better disposed of his
people have come over to us. The services
are more ornate than they were, and consequently
more attractive. So are the sermons,
I suppose. At all events, they are
shorter. Then we've got a Sisterhood and
a Young Men's Christian Association, who
play cricket in summer and football in
winter. Then again we use collecting bags,
while at Gilgal they still stick to the
plates. Of course the collections have
dropped off to a mere nothing, but the
congregations have increased wonderfully.
Certainly the plates produced a healthy
rivalry, but the bags, I take it, are less
of a tax, and the congregation assuredly
prefers them. It's a mystery to me where
they get all the threepenny-pieces, and I

am sorry to say that farthings, and even

442

buttons, are not uncommon. Still, your
father and Justice Sleek  everybody calls
him Justice Sleek now  let us have all we
want in the shape of money, so I suppose
there's nothing to complain of."

Whatever my husband may say, dear
Mrs. Haggard, there has been a great
awakening, and though he may not see it,
for none are so proverbially blind as those
who won't see, I look upon it as principally
due, at all events in my own parish,
to the exertions of my own sex. My curates
are both highly popular."

My dear, curates always are highly
popular when they are married to wealthy
good-looking young women, and their pockets
consequently bursting, literally bursting, with
half-crowns ; I may add that, in my experience,
these are the only circumstances under
which married curates are popular."

' You have much to be grateful for,
John."

"I know it, my dear  I know it," said

the vicar as he finished his coffee. And
then the party broke up to commence the
real business of the day.

No one would have recognized in the
well-appointed and terribly respectable head
keeper who touched his hat to the party of
gentlemen as they emerged upon the lawn,
the former village reprobate  Blogg, the
whilom King's Warren poacher. But soit
was. By some strange fatality or other
your poacher either becomes a confirmed
reprobate or blossoms into the very best
kind of gamekeeper. Perhaps it's on the
principle of set a thief to catch a thief
that those estates are best preserved where
the head keeper has been poacher in his
youth. Just as the man who has risen
from the ranks makes the sternest martinet
and the strictest disciplinarian, so the reformed
poacher is invariably the prince of
gamekeepers, when honest.

The vicar of King's Warren was a High
Churchman. I believe he would have ridden

to hounds with pleasure but for the fact
til at he found it impossible to find anything
up to his weight. But he sternly drew
the line at carrying 2[un. Though the
vicar denied himself this pleasure, he joined
the shooting party, for his intense appreciation
of the culinary art made violent
exercise a necessity of his existence.

As Mrs. Haggard and the vicar's wife
sat and chatted over the little details of
life at the village of King's Warren, the
happy home of the former's girlhood, Mrs.
Haggard remarked to her companion that
it was strange that they had not heard a
shot for at least half an hour. As she
uttered the words Lord Spunyarn entered
the room, pale and out of breath, and
evidently hardly able to control his emotion.

What ! back so soon. Lord Spunyarn ?
Is anything the matter ? " said Mrs. Dodd.

Something dreadful has happened."

'' Has there been an accident ? Has
anything happened to George ? " cried the

mother, and the colour left her lips as she
rose excitedly.

At that moment the ol 1 lord entered the
room.

George is safe, dear madam," said her
husband's old friend, '' but I have hurried
here as the bearer of bad news, and I must
bid you prepare for the worst."

Gad, sir, don't keep us in suspense,"
cried old Lord Pit Town, with the irritability
of age. " Is Lucius the victim ? "

No, the boys are safe, dear Mrs. Haggard,"
he continued. "My old friend is
badly' hurt. In passing through a hedge

But Mrs. Haggard had fainted in the arms
of the vicar's wife.

And then Lord Spunyarn told his tale
to the old man, while Mrs. Dodd and the
women - servants who, summoned, had
appeared upon the scene, busied themselves
around the fainting woman.

It appeared that in getting through a

hedge to pick up a bird that, wounded,
had managed to struggle through it, Eeginald
Haggard's gun had suddenly exploded and
lodged a chai-ge of shot in his chest. It
was not from carelessness ; but Hansard's
foot had caught in a rabbit burrow, and
as he fell the accident happened. Before
their eyes the thing had taken place.
There was nothing mysterious about it. It
was terribly sudden, that was all.

Hardly had Spunyarn told his tale when
Mrs. Haggard came to herself. Tearless
and wan she rose to her feet, and taking
the old earl's arm, she said simply but ina
broken voice, "Let us go to him  let
us go to him at once. Lord Pit Town ;
there may be hope  there may be hope yet."

The old man looked towards Spunyarn
interrogatively, but a shake of the head as
the only response.

Mrs. Haggard hadn't to go far to meet her
wounded husband, for as they passed into
the great entrance hall of the Castle a melancholy

little procession came in by the main
doorway. Four keepers bore a hurdle, upon
which lay Lord Pit Town's wounded heir.
His face was pale, the lips bloodless, while
cold drops stood upon his brow. The four
men halted, uncertain where to deposit their
burden. George Haggard, quitting the old
lord's arm, sprang at once to her husband's
side, seized his hand, and attempted to wipe
the death drops from his brow.

Don't touch me, George," he muttered,
and the voice sounded unequal and cavernous.
" I've suffered untold tortures in
being brought here," and his pale fingers,
whose nails had become livid, vainly fumbled
at his collar. The faithful wife tenderly
loosened the band, which appeared to almost
strangle him. " George," he continued to
his wife, " where is Spunyarn ? I must
speak with him at once."

He who had been his faithful friend from
youth to middle age stepped forward and
bent his head over the mouth of the dying

man, for he was dying. For several seconds
Haggard whispered a hurried communication
to his friend, while the bystanders,
inciting the old lord and Haggard's wife,
stood aside, so as not to interrupt the privacy
of the communication. Ever and anon
Haggard paused for breath.

Shirtings," he said at last, " you will
remember ? ''

"I will see to it, be assured of that,"
replied his friend. Lord Spunyarn. And then
Haggard motioned the old earl to his side,
and addressed him with considerable effort.

They had dragged forward a couple of
oaken benches, and had placed them one
under either end of the hurdle upon which
Haggard lay. There was a dead silence in
the great entrance hall, only broken by a
loud succession of regular ticks, caused by
Haggard's life blood, which in great drops
fell upon the tesselated pavement below with
a monotonously dreadful sound.

Good-bye, my lord," he said simply, as

with an effort he stretched out his hand,
which was affectionately grasped by the
trembling fingers of the old nobleman.
I am going," he continued, " but you have
the boys, my boys."

Perhaps it's not so bad as you think,
Eeginald. Assistance will be here shortly.
We will move you out of this at once."

"There won't be time, Lord Pit Town.
Take care of Lucius."

The dying man's eyes fell upon his wife,
and a smile passed over his pale face.
'' George," he gasped out with an efTorl,
say you forgive me and I shall die easier."

"Eeginald," she whispered, '-I have
nothing to forgive, but," she added through
her sobs, " there is something I must tell

you."

"I know it, George. I have known it
all along. Kiss me, dear," he added with
an effort, and with the kiss his spirit passed
away.

Eeginald Haggard was dead, stricken down

ere lie could succeed to the title and
estates which would have been his in the
ordinary course of nature ; but as the aged
carl turned away from the body of the man
who had been his heir, his eye fell upon
the two young men, and motioning to Lucius
lie said in a broken voice, " Give me your
arm, boy ; you're all I have left in the world
now."

All sign of grief left Lucius Haggard's
face at this public notification of his
change of position. He drew himself up
proudly, and deferentially led the old man
away. But young George Haggard didn't
hear the words ; he stood staring at his
dead father, like a man in a dream.

Is there no hope ? " he said to those
who crowded round the hurdle upon
which the body lay. The ominous tick of
the falling blood had ceased now, and as
if in answer to the young fellow's question,
the dead man's jaw fell, disclosing the
white teeth. Then George Hafjrard turned

to his mother, and at a sign from Spun-yarn
he led her from the spot.

As soon as Mrs. Haggard found herself
alone, she gave way to her natural grief.
The hero of her girlish dreams had been
snatched from her suddenly, so suddenly
that she could hardly realize that he was
actually gone from her for ever. She had
continued to idolize the man and to remain
unaware of his many deficiencies and failings,
from the very moment he had first
courted her in the rose garden at King's
Warren until his death. He had been a
fairly good husband to her, as husbands
go, and she had never ceased to love him
with a trusting affection. But bewildered
as she was by the suddenness of her
affliction, she could not help pondering
over the strange communication he had
made to her upon his death-bed.

/ have known it all along I " What had
he known all along? Had he known
that Lucius, instead of being his own son

was but the bastard child of Lucy War-render
? Surely not. AVliat could lie mean,
ir he had known it all along, by his
solemn adjuration to old Lord Pit Town
to take care of Lucius. There could be
but one interpretation to that, surely that
he looked upon the boys as his eldest son,
his heir, his first-born child. Why had her
husband asked her to forgive him on his
death-bed? Forgive bini what? He had
not bade good-bye to either of the young
fellows, but then death had probably come
upon him unawares. Could it possibly be
that her dead husband, man of the world ashe
was, could have deliberately, for the mere
sake of her cousin's honour, sacrificed the
future of his only son designedly, and without
that son's consent ? That supposition was
beyond even Georgina Haggard's credulity.
There was a mystery in the matter, a
mystery she could not fathom. The more
she thought over it, the more difficult she
found it to attempt to arrive at any

possible solution. Was it merely that lie
feared that George, being really his only'
child, that at the boy's death without heirs
the Pit ToYn title and the Pit Town wealth
should descend to some remote branch of
the family, and so perhaps he may of a
purpose have placed the second good
young life between the old lord and his
distant relatives? But that was liardl}
likely, for such a contingency could never
happen till George was in his grave ; and
Haggard himself, be it remembered, was a
wealthy man.

What then was Lucy Warrender's son to
him?

Could it be that he had a stronger, a
dearer interest in the child? But she
thrust it from her as an unworthy thought;
and she strove to banish the pliant om
she had unwittingly conjured up, by letting
her mind return once more to its natural
grief, in the thought of her awful bereavement,
her sudden widowhood.

Eeginald Haggard's death and Eeginald
Haggard's funeral were a nine days' wonder
in the neighbourhood of Walls End
Castle. Hundreds of people clad in black
attended the ceremony. The old lord,
the two young men and Lord Spunyarn
were the mourners. The shooting party
had been broken, up on the day of the
accident. A short obituary notice had appeared
in the Times, and the penny
papers had made capital of what they
termed " The Shocking Accident in the
Shooting Field," while the leader writers
had earned their daily three guineas by
more or less ingenious strings of the usual
platitudes.

Lord Spunyarn was Haggard's sole executor.
The will was opened, and commenced
with a confirmation of the terms of
his marriage settlement ; it then proceeded to
give a further legacy to his wife of half his
property for her lifetime, and he made his
dear son, George Haggard," his residuary

legatee ; " my son, Lucius Haggard," the
document continued, " being otherwise provided
for as the heir to the entailed
estates of Lord Pit Town."

It was all plain sailing, and the will was
a very natural one for a man in Haggard's
position to make.

Lord Spunyarn, who was still staying on
at the Castle, waited for twenty-four hours
after the funeral, and then he demanded
a private interview with his friend's widow.

"I am sorry to trouble you, dear Mrs.
Haggard, about business matters," he said
as he entered the little boudoir which years
ago had been devoted by the old lord to
young Mrs. Haggard's use, 'but I am compelled
to worry you with a long and
painful conversation on family matters.
My dear lady," he continued, " I should
have been the very last person to trouble
you with the communication which I am
about to make, had it not been my

friend's dying wish and command."

VOL. in. 45

"Sit down, Lord Spunyarn, sit down,"
lie said, " nothing you can have to tell
me can be more painful than the suspense,
suspicion, and anxiety of mind which I
have endured for the last few days. Tell
me the worst at once. I have nothing to
forgive my husband. When on his deathbed
he asked for my forgiveness, I feared
that there was something dreadful to come ;
but I fully and freely forgave him. Lord
Spunyarn, and whatever you may have to
tell, it will not alter my affection for his
memory."

' Dear Mrs. Haggard," said the philanthropist,
with a little sigh, " the matter
concerns the future, as well as the past ;
the secret has been w-ell kept, and my
poor friend has done his duty in providing
for his son George, and for you.
I must tell you that at one time I had
my suspicions, but the thing seemed in
itself so monstrous, so improbable, that I
put it from me as an unworthy thought.

When your late husband whispered those
last words to me as he was dying,
he informed me that I was his executor,
and told me to examine a little red
box that I should find at his banker's,
and then to tell you everything. I obtained
the box ; I have examined it, and
it is here." As he said the words, he
placed a little red morocco box upon the
table.

452

A LITTLE RED BOX.

I don't think Lord Spunyarn could have
really found it cold in Mrs. Haggard's
boudoir in the second week of September ;
perhaps it was for the sake of collecting
his ideas that he busied himself with the
fire and added another toy log to the
flickering embers upon the dainty hearth ;
then he sat down, and staring straight at
the little red morocco box upon the
table, he began.

I think it may perhaps spare your
feelings a little, dear Mrs. Haggard, if I
tell you that from what my poor friend
said, and from the contents of this box,
I have become aware of the secret of
Lucius's birth." He never took his eyes
off the box for one instant, or lie

would have seen as he said the words
that the widow's face grew white as the
lawn cuffs upon her wrists.

She interrupted him suddenly.

"It is not I who have betrayed the
secret. I have guarded it faithfully for
twenty years, God forgive me," she added
with a sigh. " But what could I do ? I
was bound to shield my cousin, even if I
had not sworn to her to do so ; for she
would not take my word for it. Lord
Spunyarn. No hint of it has ever passed
my lips. Conceive my astonishment when
my dying husband told me that he was
aware of the fact, for I suppose it wa
that he meant, when he said to me, with
almost his last breath, that he had ' known
it all along.' "

"Yes," said her husband's old friend,
still staring at the little red box, " and
then'"

And then he died. Lord Spunyarn,"
she said with a sigh ; " but he had asked

me to forgive him, and to take care of
Lucius."

And did you forgive him, dear madam ? "

Of course I forgave him."

And you forgive him still ? "

Certainly, though what it was he wished
me to forgive I cannot tell."

But Lord Spunyarn never looked at her ;
he only stared at the box upon the table.
"I'm glad you forgave him," he said,
 fully and freely."

Fully and freely," she echoed.

"Mrs. Haggard, you had much to forgive.
When you promised to take care of
Lucius, had you any idea whose son he
was ? "

10, Lord Spunyarn, nor have I now ;
poor Lucy would never tell me that, and
I never pressed her, for it did not concern
me."

It concerned you very nearly, dear
madam."

Their eyes met, and those of the widow

Averse filled with mingled astonishment and
horror.

*' Ko, Lord Spunyarn ; do not tell me

that Lucius's father was " and her eyes

flashed with indignant rage.

It is best to gat it over  he teas your
husband ! "

There was a dead silence of some
seconds.

Go on, Lord Spunyarn," said the widow
in a hollow voice ; " then I am guiltless at
least of deceiving him for years. It is
horrible ! " But she shed no tear.

Your husband, dear lady, when he was
dying, gave it in charge to me to let you
see the contents of this box, which, he too
truly said, would explain all. I, too, at
times, had my suspicions ; for remember
this, I too loved your cousin long ago,
and your husband was my dearest friend''
The man buried his face in his hands and
was silent for a moment ; he pulled himself
together with an effort. " When I saw

what the box contained, the whole ghastly
secret was laid bare to me in an instant.
You remember when we were in Eome,
by chance, by merest chance, I saw your
husband at a masked ball with a lady ; at
that ball arose the quarrel between your
husband and the unfortunate Frenchman
who fell by his hand. The box will tell
you the rest. The masked lady wore a
magnificent pair of single-stone diamond
earrings." Spunyarn unlocked the box,
placed it in front of his friend's widow
and walked to the window.

With trembling fingers Mrs. Haggard
opened it. There was a little packet of
letters in Lucy Warrender's undeveloped
girlish hand, the ink of which had faded ;
then a pair of single-stone brilliant earrings,
which sparkled and shimmered in the
firelight, as the widow took them in her
trembling fingers ; to one of them was still
attached the duplicate of the Mont de Pike,
dated the very day of her cousin's death.

Last of all was a little purple velvet case
on which was her husband's monogram
with the single word " Eome," and a date
just over twenty years ago. She opened
it with difficulty ; in it was a lovely miniature,
not a mere photographer's likeness,
of her cousin Lucy in all the pride of her
girlish beauty, as a shepherdess, in powdered
hair and in a Watteau costume.
The face seemed to smile at her with
an air of insolent triumph, that old
smile of Lucy's which her cousin remembered
so well in the days gone by,
but which she had missed for many a long
year. The painter had not forgotten to
place in the ears of the shepherdess a
pair of single-stone earrings ; in the hand
was the ordinary black silk vizard worn at
masquerades, and the shepherdess was depicted
in the act of unmasking. Nothing
more pretty, nothing more piquant, nothing
more cliic could be imagined. The widow
placed the miniature upon the table, and

as she did so a single object still remaining
in the box caught her eye. It was only a
little black silk mask, and from the two
holes in the toy, in her disordered imagination,
the eyes of her dead cousin still
seemed to sparkle with a mocking light.
She dropped the miniature into the box
and closed the lid which shut out the
horrid phantom.

As the box closed with an angry click,
Lord Spunyarn turned towards the victim
of her husband's perfidy.

There is no need of explanation ; my
husband was right. I understand it all,
but I forgave him, Lord Spunyarn, and I
forgive him still. Poor Lucius ! "

This was all she said.

Spunyarn resumed his seat at the fireside.
Then there was a long silence, which neither
seemed disposed to break.

At last with an effort he spoke. " What
is to be done, dear madam ? I wish the
secret had remained in the dead man's

keeping ; it is a dreadful responsibility. Can
it be still kept?"

"It is my duty towards my dead husband,
Lord Spunyarn," she said decisively.

"But you have another duty, dear lady;
a duty to your son and a duty to the
old man here, who looks on Lucius as his
heir."

My son must suffer with me, Lord
Spunyarn, for his father's fault."

Spunyarn shook his head. "Not so, dear
lady ; there is but one way, one possible
way, to preserve the reputation of those
who are gone and to do justice, for justice
must be done. Pit Town must know ;
for others, taking the lowest standpoint,
may possess the secret, and the honour of
the family must not be compromised,
lucius must efface himself, that is the
only course."

Efface himself. Lord Spunyarn ? I know
the boy, the orphan boy ; he was my husband's
child; and with all his faults I love

him ; he will never consent to that ; he
would die first," said Eeginald Haggard's
widow.

"And die he must, I mean socially. There
is no other way."

He will never consent, Lord Spunyarn,"
repeated the widow. "He is. wrapped up in
the fact that he is Lord Pit Town's heir.
With George it is different ; he is my own
son, my very son," she added bitterly, " and,
if I wish it, he will give up everything
for my sake and his father's ; his father's
honour is as dear to him as it is to me.
Besides, my husband evidently foresaw the
dilemma in which he has placed us, and
made the boy his heir."

"But justice, dear lady, justice "

"Justice, Lord Spunyarn," cried the indignant
woman as she rose to her feet.
"God's justice, do you mean, or man's? Is
it not enough that my husband should have
betrayed and fooled me for twenty years,
and should have robbed my boy of his very

heritage, and more than that, of half the
treasure of a mother's love ? For I tell you,
strange and unnatural as it may seem, that
I love Lucius ; ay, I love him, though he
is poor Lucy's child and my husband's
bastard. And who could help loving the
poor helpless, friendless, neglected child ?
Yes, I acted the love at first. Lord Spun-yarn,
and it grew upon me till it became
a part of myself. Is it for nothing, that
when my husband was bleeding to death
before my very eyes, that he bade me take
care of Lucius? I have been a faithful and
obedient wife, Lord Spunyarn, and I will
obey my husband's last behest to the letter.
I will protect his son's interests and his
son's rights."

Alas, he has no rights, dear madam,"
said Spunyarn gently.

The secret, Lord Spunyarn, is not yours
or mine ; it is my husband's and hers," she
added, pointing to the box. "When she
made me swear to keep her secret, she

threatened to haunt me should I betray
her. How could I answer her ? It was a
girl's idle jest, I know ; but I did swear it,
God knows how unwillingly, and Heaven
help me I will keep my oath. Yes, I will
keep my oath," here she sank into a chair,
and covering her face with her hands, wept
bitterly.

Lord Spunyarn paced the room in doubt.
He was a man of principle, a religious mana
man of honour  strange combination forsooth
in this nineteenth century, and he remembered
that his mouth was closed. But
was he, a good man, to stand idly by and
see a great wrong done ? Was he to see the
honours and title of a noble family descend
to a bastard through the secret machinations
of an artful woman ? Heaven forbid !

Think it over, dear madam, think it
over," he said ; " let me beg you, at least,
to sleep on it, and God give you counsel,"
he added in a broken voice, and then
leaving the little red box and its contents

upon the table where it lay, he hurriedly
left the room.

While the interview which has been described
was taking place, the two young
men were walking briskly up and down
the great avenue, which was already yellow
2; with commencing' autumn.

It was Lucius who spoke.

"We have changed places, George, with
a vengeance ; it is I who am the pauper
now. If my father meant to surprise me,
he certainly succeeded. You are the man
of property, George, while I am rich only
in expectations. Thank goodness, neither
my father, the old man, nor an' one
else can keep fine out of the title and the
entailed property ; but there may be a
deuce of a long time to wait. By Jove!
you know these very okl men don't die,
they dry up. Why, look at grandfather
Warrender. It's a horrid nuisance this
mourning, though I shall be heartily
glad when I have to go into black

next time. His lordship is a decided
obstructions ; " so spoke the elder brother,
as he blew a big cloud of smoke into the
air.

Don't pretend to be a brute, Lucius ;
you don't mean it, you know, old fellow,"
said George.

"But I do mean it, though. There's no
more ridiculous custom than mourning.
It's a monstrous thing and ought to be
done away with by act of parliament, like
suttee in India was  we could see the
absurdity of that. We have a kind of
modified suttee here. Why, look at mother !
Why should she have to dress herself like a
guy? It's a ridiculous custom, I say. Why
should I have to wear black gloves in order
that I may exhibit my woe by the stains
on my fingers ? And why should I be
compelled to look like a British workingman
out for a holiday, and pass the greater
part of my time in flicking the dust off my
clothes? I've been badly treated, George,

and now I find myself pitchforks into a
ridiculous position. Here I am, heir to a
title and any amount of coin, and without
a farthing I can call my own. I wonder
whether the old man will think fit to make
me an allowance ; he gave Hetton a big
one, I have always heard. Do you suppose
I offended the governor, George ? "

'' Xo ; the will was made several years
ago, you know, when we were boys''

'well, it's uncommonly rough. Anyhow,

you'll allow that, I suppose ; and I confess

I don't care for the viae of a waiter upon

Providence. The only thing 1 seem to have

inherited at all is Capt, and I shall rid

myself of him at the earliest opportunity ;:

he must Have saved a pile of money ; he

ought to go back to Switzerland and start

an hotel. They all do, I believe, when

they don't cut their master's throats as

Courvoisier did. By Jove ! I wonder whether

Capt would lend me any money ? If he

won't, I must try the Jews. Why, since the
VOL. ni. 46

governor died, I've been inundated with
circulars from the house of IsraeL"

You needn't trouble about money,
Lucius ; you can have anything you want
from me, you know."

It's very good of you to say so, George ;
but as I shall have to go to the Jews sooner
or later, it's hardly worth while spunging
upon you. I may as well take the bull by
the horns at once. Though, between ourselves,
I don't see why my mother shouldn't
do something for me, and so circumvent
the governor's injustice. You and she got
all the plunder between you."

"Don't talk like that, Lucius. It's not
right. It's hard on you, very hard ; but I
wouldn't have anything to do with moneylender
if I were you."

Oh, of course not ; that's the good

advice all you wealthy fellows always give

us poor devils ; it's the way of the world."

You're not fair, Lucius ; we are both

under age, but this you can rely on, till

you come into your own, at all events,
you're welcome to share my purse."
Do you really mean that, George ? "
Of course I mean it, or I shouldn't say it."
I didn't believe you were half the good
fellow that you are, my boy. Let's shake
hands on it," and the two young fellows
shook hands, but George's generosity was a
bitter pill indeed to Lucius Haggard.

]mr. Liurice Capt did not find himself
comfortable under the new regime. lie was
still Mr. Haggard's man, but things were
changed ; he disliked his new master, and
his sliar|) eyes soon detected that the dislike
was more than reciprocated. When
Lucy Warrender died, what he looked upon
as a legitimate source of income he suddenly
found closed to him for ever. The
proprietor of a valuable secret is naturally
anxious to secure the best return possible
from his property, but unfortunately in Mr.
Capt's case dividends may be said to have

ceased. As he turned the matter over in

462

this mind lie disliked iiis investment more
and more. It seemed to have assumed the
aspect of a very unpromising property indeed.
What was he to do? The terms of
Eeginald Haggard's will were no secret to
him, for, in his first rage and mortification,
the young Lucius had confided his woes
to his late father's confidential servant.
Should he, the valet, hang on at Walls
End Castle for an indefinite period, until
Lucy Warrender's son should come into the
old lord's property, when he would be able to
recommence the blackmailing process which
he had so successfully carried out upon the
young man's mother ? He knew enough of the
character of Lucius Haggard to feel certain
that the power he would possess in such a case
would be boundless. But Mr. Capt was no
longer a young man ; he, like his master,
might die suddenly, and then the secret would
die with him. That miserable anticipation
filled him with horror and indignation.
Should he o to the widow, inform her that

he shared her secret, and, for a good round
sum in ready money, sell his silence, and of
course betray her as soon as he found it convenient
to do so ? Should he go to the old
earl, and make the best bargain he could
under the circumstances ? He was torn by
conflicting doubts. Mr. Capt had an observant
eye ; he had noticed that there had been
an exciting? interview between the widow and
her late husband's executor, and he became
aware of the fact that a little red morocco box,
which in the old days had usually accompanied
his master upon his travels, had
passed into Mrs. Haggard's personal custody.
Intuitively, he correctly jumped to the conclusion,
that in some way or other, the red
morocco box was connected with the secret
of Lucius Haggard's birth. Mr. Capt felt
then that it was his duty, as a prudent man,
to ascertain the nature of the contents
of the box, or even to obtain possession
of it. Promptitude as well as firmness
had characterised every action of Mr. Capt's

life ; with him to determine was to execute,
and he made up his mind not to rest until he
had mastered the secret of the box, and that
his subsequent action should be guided by
the information so obtained.

Eeginald Haggard was a wise man, a man
who burnt his letters, a man who was asa
rule untroubled by sentiment. The one
episode in his early life over which, to him,
there had still hung a sort of unhealthy halo
of romance, was the affair with Lucy Warrender.
Many a time and oft had common sense
urged him to commit the contents of the
little red box to the flames ; but he knew too
well that somehow or another his wife had
become the involuntary accomplice of her
cousin's fault. He had not burned the contents
of the box ; if he had done so the secret, as
far as he was concerned, would probably have
died with him ; but he had not burned it.
Hence his whispered death-bed confession to
his friend Spunyarn, and his appeal to his
wife for forgiveness.

Mrs. Haororard had turned the matter over

Coin

her mind again and again. To her it
seemed unnecessary to rake up an old scandal,
at least during Lord Pit Town's life ; the propriety
of letting sleeping dogs lie commended
itself very strongly to her mind. She herself
was quite convinced that when it became
necessary to communicate the secret to young
Lucius Hacrcrard things would risht themselves
without a scandal. Of course Lucius
would do what was right, and so would
George for the matter of that. Spunyarn's
suggestion that Lucius Haggard should
efface himself," and so voluntarily suffer a
social death, seemed to her but a brutal and
inhuman method of cutting the Gordian knot.
She had never again opened the little red
box, since she had closed it on the occasion
of her interview with her husband's executor.
To her mind the simplest thing of all would
have been to do away with the box and its
contents, but she gave way to the better judgment
of Spunyarn in this matter. On one

tiling, however, she was determined : by no
act of hers should her dead cousin's shameful
secret be dragged into the light of day ; and
so she made up her mind to communicate her
decision to Spumarn, and to deliver the box
to him for safety.

Lord Spunyarn's reflections upon the whole
matter convinced him of one things his own
unenviable position. To his mind the
matter was thoroughly clear, and his own
duty peremptorily defined. He had received
the secret as a death bed confidence ; there
could be no doubt as to the mystery of
Lucius Haggard's birth. It was certainly
not for him to stand calmly by and seethe
Pit Town title and the Pit Town estates
pass to Eeginald Haggard's bastard son. It
was his duty to take the old lord into
.his confidence and to break the matter
to the brothers. His own evidence and
that of George's mother, coupled with the
contents of the box, would set the facts
at rest beyond a doubt. If young Lucius

were an honourable man he would not
attempt to make matters worse by a useless
contest in the Law Courts, but would
doubtless of his own accord see the wisdom
of disappearing into an honourable obscurity,
while Lord Pit Town and George Haggard
would, of course, provide for him. He felt
assured that having bad time for reflection
Mrs. Haggard herself would inevitably consent
to this, the only possible course of
action. As to her scruples respecting her
cousin's secret, they would be overcome.
It was then with a mind fully made up
that Lord Spunyarn demanded a second
interview with his dead friend's widow, and
lie requested young Lucius Haggard to
await his summons to speak with them " on
a matter which," as he phrased it, " concerns
you nearly."

He found Mrs. Haggard comparatively
cheerful.

I have thought it all over. Lord Spun-yarn,"
she said. " You were my husband's

friend. I place myself in your hands unreservedly."


Spunyarn gave a sigh of relief, and then
he proceeded to sketch the course of action
which we have given alive.

"We weill tell no one, dear Mrs. Haggard.
George himself need never know. The
whole thing can be a simple matter of
arrangement. Of course Lucius must know
all, and Pit Town. I purpose to break
it to Lucius at once, and to him at least
your cousin's name need never be mentioned.
He is his father's son after all."

His father's son," she said with a sigh.
Yes, his father's son," she repeated with
meaning. '' Must it be done to-day ? "

"Don't let us procrastinate, dear lady.
Shall I send for him? He is awaiting our
summons."

The widow nodded, and Spunyarn went
to seek the youth, who in a few minutes
was to be stripped of name and fame and
wealth.

So far from suspecting a communication
of an unpleasant nature, young Lucius
Haggard, his face wreathed in anticipatory
smiles, was impatiently drumming upon the
window-pane in the library with his fingertips.
It seemed to him that this formal
interview with his mother and his father's
executor could have but one object, namely,
to announce to him that a suitable provision
was to be made for the heir to the
Pit Town title during the short time that

o

must necessarily elapse ere lie should come
into his heritage. But his anticipations
were considerably damped by Lord Spun-yarn's
first words. The elder man placed
his hand affectionately upon the young
fellow's shoulder.

"Lucius, my poor bo}'," he said, "prepare
yourself for a surprise, and a great
disappointment," he added ominously.

The happy smile of anticipation left
the young fellow's face as he heard the
words.

Well, Lord Spunyarn," lie said, " Alien
my father cut me off without even the
proverbial shilling, I thought he had done
the worst he could for me."

Lord Spunyarn took no notice of the
remark.

'' My poor fellow," he said, " steel yourself
to hear what I have to tell you. I
will tell you now," he added, " to spare
your poor mother the pain and horror of
having the sad story repeated in her
presence. Lucius," he said solemnly, " you
are no long-er the heir to the Pit Town
title, and all that goes with it."

Good heavens ! " cried the ounce man
as he sank into a chair, " it can't be true.
Did Hetton contract a secret marriage, and
is there a son? Does the old man know
of it ? "

It isn't that, Lucius. Compose yourself,"
Spunyarn added after a short pause,
*rand listen to what I have to tell you.
This tliino- concerns you and your brother

only. Lucius, bear it like a man, but, my
poor boy, you are illegitimate."

"Did my mother dare " he began, but

Spunyarn stopped him with a gesture.

Lucius," he said severely, " the lady
who has allowed you to call her mother
from the time you were a little child, did
so out of kindness ; speak no ill word of
her, my boy, for to her you owe everything,
to her love, and to her forbearance."


Great God ! Lord Spunyarn, it can't be
true, there is some base plot in the matter.
Who is the heir, the man who calls himself
the heir, I mean ? " he asked fiercely,
and he clenched his hands ; and his eyes,
Lucy Warrender's eyes, sparkled with mingled
raofe and hate. " We shall contest the thintr,
of course ? "

"The heir, Lucius, the rightful heir, is
your brother George ; he was born in wedlock,
while you, alas, though your other's
son, are "

''' Not base born ; don't say that, Lord
Spunyarn.''

But Spunyarn nodded sadly.

I won't believe it, Lord Spunyarn," almost
shouted the young man with uncontrollable
fury. " Have you, my father and
my mother, been hatching this infernal plot
between you all these years? Can the deadman's
hand strike me, even from beyond the
grave ? I won't believe it, it isn't true.
I'll fio-ht it in the Courts. What does Lord
Pit Town say? Does he give a tacit consent
to my undoing ? "

Pit Town as yet knows nothing. Lucius,
try to be calm. Listen to me," and as
gently as he could he broke to the indignant
boy the dismal fact of his heritage
of shame, that he was but Eeginald Haggard's
love-child after all."

"And my mother?" said the boy in a
broken voice.

No need to speak of her, Lucius ; she is
dead."

Have you the proofs, Lord Spunyarn,
of all this ? " said the boy more calmly, after
he had listened to Spunyarii's narrative in
silence. " It'll have to be proved, you know,
proved to the hilt ; that at least is my right,
and I'll not forego ito



"Lucius, you have no rights."
I must see the proofs, at least."
Yes, you must see them, I suppose, but
spare your mother, Lucius ; she is broken
down with grief and suffering."

"Lord Spunyarn," said the boy coldly,
you say she is not my mother ; why should
I spare the feelings of my father's accomplice
? Feelings forsooth ;" and he laughed
bitterly.

Lucius, you are mad. Let me beseech
you, as a gentleman, in the painful interview
that must take place, to spare your
father's widow as much as possible. Deal
gently with her, boy ; it is she who has been
the victim in the whole matter."

Don't bandy words with me. Lord ,"

cried the young man, and for the
moment the impetuous Eeginald Haggard
of bygone years seemed to stand before the
astonished nobleman in the very flesh. " You
tell me," he continued in a calmer tone,
that George Hafcrard is the heir, that I
am but my father's base-born child. Show
me the proofs of this and I'll believe it ;
till then, Lord Spunyarn, I simply say jon
lie," and the young man bowed defiantly.
Let us go," he continued, " to the clever
woman who has hoodwinked me for a lifetime.
I follow you, sir."

Lord Spunyarn made no reply, but led
the way to the widow's boudoir.

As they entered, Mrs. Haggard rose and
opened her arms to Lucius, but she sunk
again into her chair, staring with sad
astonishment at the extraordinary transformation
that had been suddenly effected
in the young man. His dead father, in
an access of furious passion, seemed to
stand before her. No answering look of

affection was upon his face ; the young
mouth was firmly set, and the eyes glittered
with savage defiance.

' Lucius," she said with an effort, '* dear
Lucius."

Madam," he replied, as, uninvited, he
seated himself with an attempt at dignity,
his lordship has inflicted upon me a
strange and improbable store I have
told him, and I do honestly believe it, that
that wild story is a lie, a wicked lie. He
tells me that you hold the proofs. Let me
then see these proofs, that I may make him
my humble apologies, and go out from
your presence into the world a nameless
beggar. But you will please remember
that you will find it difficult to deceive
me, and to deceive Lord Pit Town, fur
you must cheat us both."

Lucius," said Mrs. Haggard in a broken
voice.

But Lord Spunyarn interrupted her. " I

had hoped, dear lady," he said, " to have
VOL. in. 47

spared you such a scene as this ; let me
deal with him, Mrs. Haggard. The proofs,
Lucius," he added, " are here. I myself
can supply the few missing links in the
chain of evidence. It is but natural, perhaps,"
he said, " and you have, as you say,
a right to see these sad proofs, unhappy
boy, of the miserable folly and wickedness
of your real parents. Look at them,
then ; examine them for yourself, and then
you cannot fail to be convinced that I
have not lied to you after all."

He turned the key in the lock and softly
opened the box ; then the astonished man
gave a sudden start and placed his hand
to his forehead.

Young Lucius Haggard rose to his feet,
and laughed a loud, indignant, mocking
laugh.

The box teas empty !

LUCIUS Haggard IS BEWILDERED.

John, Earl of Pit Town, was above all
things an art-worshipper. He was never
tired of peramlmlating the great galleries
of Pit Town Castle and admiring the collection,
which it had been his life-long
labour of love to bring together. When
his son, the late Lord Hetton, had come to
his sudden and dreadful end, the old man
had felt the blow severely ; when his heir,
Eeginald Haggard, had been snatched away
in the pride of his manhood, it had affected
him in a less degree ; but he had felt the
blow from its very suddenness. Ever since
Reginald Haggard's wife had come to live
at the Castle, he had ceased to feel that
he was alone in the world, and a deep

affection had sprung up between the two.

472

As for Haggard's boys, now bursting into
early manhood, he loved them somewhat
for themselves, but still more for the sake
of the woman who had been a daughter
to him, and the stay and comfort of his
waning years. Always orderly and methodical,
he had settled the ultimate disposition
of his property with justice and discretion.
He was immensely wealthy. As we have
said, the entailed property was extremely
large, but was exceeded in actual money
value by the great mineral wealth which
was disposable by will. The value of
several ordinary estates, too, was locked
up in the vast collection contained in the
new galleries.

The future possessor of the Pit Town
title would be a lucky man indeed if he
got the treasures so laboriously accumulated,
during his long lifetime, by old Lord
Pit Town. The old man lived by strict
rule. He had a curious theory that, barring
accidents, the span of human life

might be ordinarily calculated at sixty-five
years ; that is, supposing that one third
of the time, or eight hours a day, was
given to sleep. He believed, too, that
just as the span of life is undoubtedly
shortened by indiscretions and excesses,
particularly in the matters of diet and
drink ; so he considered that span to be
indubitably lengthened, if the ordinary rules
of common prudence were carefully observed.
But Lord Pit Town went further
than this. Continual association with Dr.
Wolff had converted the old nobleman to
an extraordinary and original theory which
was held by the doctor of philosophy.
This theory was a delightfully simple one.
Dr. Wolff was accustomed to sum it upas
follows : "The human body is a machine,
and wotdd go on working for ever did not
certain parts of it gradually wear out. It is
our duty to make the machine last as long
as possible. When not in use it should be
run at the lowest rate of speed, in order

to reduce the rapidity of the deterioration.
If I don't want to wear out my boots," Dr.
Wolff would triumphantly remark, " I put
on my slippers ; therefore, as my body is
more precious to me than even my new
boots, I never unnecessarily wear it out.
A certain minimum amount of exercise is
undoubtedly necessary to health ; let us
take that by all means, but no more. Let
us avoid unnecessary exertion of all kinds,
physical or mental ; let us not ride if we
can drive, let us not walk if we can ride,
let us not stand when we can sit, and
certainly we should not sit if we can lie
down ; above all things we should not
remain awake if we can possibly sleep,
and even in sleeping we should, if possible,
refrain from dreams. The valuable machine
which we are possessed of should be run at
tale lowest possible speed, that it may last
the longer. Strong emotions of all kinds
should be just as obnoxious to us as strong
drinks. Holding it as an absolute fact

that, barring unavoidable accidents, a certain
definite amount of wakefulness is
allotted to every man, every opportunity
should be seized for running the machine
at the lowest possible rate by the simplest
paeans ; that is to say, to put it shortly,
never remain awake without an object, as
you are uselessly expending the allotted
time of Life, that is to say, of Wakefulness''
But Dr. Wolff and his disciple went further
than this : they looked upon sleep as the
secret recuperative power of nature. They
considered that in sleep they had discovered
the real vis cicatrix nature. Their
curiosity was aroused as to the success of
their theory ; they were neither of them
particularly anxious to become very old
men, except that their doing so would
tend to prove the correctness of their views.
Lord Pit Town himself had already
reached an almost patriarchal age ; he slept
and dozed frequently in the daytime, thus
carrying out the principles of what the

doctor proudly termed the "Wolffian
Theory." Under no pretext whatever would
any servant at Walls End Castle have
dared to awaken either the doctor or the old
lord ; they were never called m the morning,
and in the midst of the most interesting
conversations they were both of them in
the habit, without the slightest apology,
of suddenly closing their eyes and taking
a deep draught of what they called
nature's recuperative elixir. Everybody
in Walls End Castle knew perfectly well
Avliat the servants meant, when they said
that either the old lord or his faithful
henchman was engaged ; it simply signified
that the two human dormice were carrying
out the Wolffian Theory.

In sleep they were both accustomed to
seek refuge from disturbing influences of
all kinds. On the second day of Mrs. Dodd's
visit to the Castle she had seized the opportunity
of improving the occasion, when
she suddenly came upon the old lord and

the philosopher, each of whom was seated
in an easy chair, silently drinking in the
beauties of the celebrated Pit Town Turner,
which formed one of the gems of the new
galleries.

I hope I'm not intruding," the energetic
lady remarked, as she burst in upon
the scene of tranquil enjoyment; "I don't
disturb you, Lord Pit Town ? " she said.

Certainly not, dear madam ; nothing disturbs
me. I allow nothing to disturb me
now."

No, nothing disturbs us ; nothing short
of an earthquake, Frau Predhjer ; it is
against our principle, you know, and that
is why we don't rise at your approach,"
chimed in the doctor of philosophy ; and
the eyes of the two gentlemen by common
accord left Mrs. Dodd and returned
to their meditative contemplation of the
great landscape.

Mrs. Dodd was astonished but not
abashed ; she had never known what it was

to be abashed in the whole course of her
life. " Their conduct is very peculiar," she
thought. "That German man, if he had
the instincts of a gentleman, should at
least rise and explain the pictures to me ;
as for the old lord, I suppose he's in his
second childhood. I wonder what ' Frau
Premier' means?" "Ah, Lord Pit Town,"
she said, apostrophising the old nobleman
and utterly ignoring the obnoxious Wolff,
I must confess to a feeling of sadness
when I look at all these beautiful things,
and when I think how much might have
been done with the vast sums that they
must have cost," and she put up her eyeglass
and read the descriptive label affixed to
the frame of the great Turner. " So that is
the celebrated picture," she continued, " and
did it really cost four thousand pounds ? Oh,
Lord Pit Town," she went on, in the tone
she might have used to a little child detected
red-handed in some act of juvenile depravity,
" when we think how much might

have been done with four thousand pounds,
when we read m the statistics of the Society
for the Conversion of the Jews that it costs
little more than four thousand pounds to
convert one of that proverbially stiff-necked
race, one cannot look at that picture without
emotion."

She waited for a moment for the old
lord to excuse himself; she looked from the
picture to the venerable nobleman ; his eyes
were tightly shut ; he was evidently taking
a deep draught of the recuperative elixir.
Then she turned in search of sympathy to
the man who had called her '' Frau Pre-tiger''
he too was employed in exactly
the same manner. For the first time in her
life Mrs. Dodd found herself absolutely and
distinctly ignored; she was to these two
dreadful men as if she did not exist ; it
was too much, she turned and fled. As
the vicar's wife flung out of the gallery,
the two enthusiasts reopened their eyes
and resumed their contemplation of Turner's

masterpiece. From this little incident
it may be seen that the old lord and his
companion were not easily disturbed in the
even tenor of their tranquil lives.

Lord Spunyarn's feelings after the stormy
interview with young Lucius Haggard where
not to be envied. He hated to meddle and
to make. It's quite true that he had been
forced into his present position by Haggard's
dying communication, and it was by
no fault of his owen that he suddenly found
himself mixed up in the exceedingly intricate
family affairs of other people. It was
an unpleasant position ; he had seen with
his own eyes the links of evidence which
completed the chain of proof that plainly
demonstrated the truth of what his old
friend had told him on his death-bed. How
and by whom the contents of the little red
box had been mysteriously spirited away he
was unable to imagine ; certainly not by
his friend's widow for Mrs. Haggard, he
knew, was the soul of honour ; certainly

Lucius could have lead no hand in the
abstraction. It seemed to Spunyarn's mind
imperative upon him to communicate the
whole matter to the old earl, and so shift
the entire responsibility upon the shoulders
of the head of the family. Possibly the
old lord, as the possessor of unbounded
wealth, might be able to make arrangements
satisfactory to himself and to the
naturally conflicting interests of the two
3oung men. In any case an open scandal
must be avoided, and the Pit Town title
and estates, whatever might become of the
old lord's money, must not be diverted from
the legitimate heir. How he wished that
he had never accepted that autumn invitation
to Pit Town Castle ! He knew full
well that young Lucius Haggard would not
relinquish one tittle of what he considered
his rights. It was difficult to escape from
the horns of the dilemma. It was quite
certain that Mrs. Haggard would not move
in the matter, and to let Lucy Warrender's

child rob George Haggard of this birthright
seemed to him a crime. The only other
alternative being a scandalous trial in open
court and the dragging of the whole matter
before the public. As a man of the world,
Lord Spunyarn was quite aware that a secret
ceases to be a secret when there are too
many depositories of it ; for this reason he
could not even consult the legal advisers
of the family. He felt that George Haggard
must be told sooner or later : that was a
plain dut3\ He felt, too, that it were better
that the boy should learn the secret from
him, but the communication of the matter
to the old lord was still more imperative,
and that communication must be made at
once, for Spunyarn well knew that the life
of the fragile old nobleman hung by a
thread, and that there was no exaggeration
in Lucius Hasorard's statement that Lord
Pit Town might go off at any moment.
From what Spunyarn knew of George Haggard
and his mother, he felt, in the event

of the old earl's death, that it was more
than probable that Lucius Haggard would be
allowed to succeed to everything, contrary
to all the dictates of human justice. At
this thought all Spunyarn's class instincts
violently revolted.

Since the very starting communication
which had been made to him, Lucius Haggard
had thought of nothing else. To be
suddenly told that one is a bastard is bad
enough even for an ordinary mortal, but
to a youth who has considered himself
porphyro-genitus to be informed that he is
but of common clay after all, and, worse
than that, base-born, is terrible indeed.
Since he had heard the story, young Lucius
had been unable to obtain even a sip of
the doctor's recuperative elixir. He believed
the tale  he couldn't doubt it  for he knew
that the woman who had been a mother
to him could not lie. So Lucius Haggard
believed the story, and his only consolation
was that the proofs were missing. Possession

is nine points of the law he very well knew,
and he thanked his stars that the onus
2robandi, fortunately for him, lay with those
whom he already looked upon as " the other
side." But he could not rest, for the mysterious
contents of the box, whatever they
had been, might be discovered at any moment,
and, like Damocles, he trembled at
the suspended sword.

You're not looking well, sir," said Mr.
Capt, as he appeared with the dressing
materials in the morning. " Won't you lie
a little while longer?" said the valet. "I
can bring up your breakfast, sir."

"Ini all right, Capt. I've only had a
bad night," and then the vale drew the
curtains, and the young fellow looked once
more upon the well-timbered landscape
which till yesterday he had regarded as all
his own. And then he gave a long sigh,
which came from the very bottom of his
heart.

The light seems to hurt your eyes, sir,"

said the valet, as lie slight out what had

now become a hateful picture.

I think you're right, Capt, I'll have an

extra hour's sleep ; you can leave me, and

when I want my breakfast I'll ring for it,"

and Lucius Haggard turned his face to the

wall as the valet left the room. But he

didn't attempt to sleep ; he began once more

to turn over the matter in his mind and

to meditate upon the best course of action

to pursue. Should he have an interview

with the possessor of his father's heritage,.

the heir to what he had once looked upon

as his own birthright ? He well knew young'

George Haggard's generosity. Should he

make a clean breast of the whole matter

to George, and propose that come what

might, they two should share and share

alike by mutual consent? Of course such

a contract would not be legally binding, ashe

well knew, but he felt that should George

consent to such an arrangement, he, the

more astute, could break the contract Aliens
in. 48

ever he saw fit. If lie could only get hold
of those papers, or whatever they were, and
destroy them, his position would become
almost impregnable ; he would still remain
practically Lord Pit Town's heir. Should
the old man be talked over, even he, could
not keep him out of the title and the entailed
property. Could it be that in her love and
affection for him, or in a horror of a scandal
being attached to her name or to her dead
husband's, that Mrs. Haggard had destroyed
what the little red box had once contained ?
No, he couldn't hope that. To whose interest
was it that the proofs, whatever they were,
should disappear ? To his, and to his alone.
But surely no one would commit so stupendous
an act of villainy merely to benefit
him, or to wrong the man whom he still
called his brother ? should Spunyarn lay
the whole matter before the old lord ? And
if he did so would Lord Pit Town take the
tale for gospel without proof  proof, the very
existence of which was now problematical ?

Should he at once go to the earl and pose
as the outraged victim of a base conspiracy,
with the hope of enlisting the powerful support
of the head of the family? The more
he thought over all these things, the more
was he overwhelmed with a sense of his own
impotence. If he could only get hold of
what the box had contained and destroy it,
he would be comparatively safe ; for he felt
that even were he to peaceably come into
the possession of what he had once considered
his own, what a life of doubt and terror
would be unquestionably his, so long as
those proofs, those dreadful proofs, existed.
If the whole strange story were but a fabrication
after all  even that was possible.
Eeginald Haggard was his father; both Lord
Spunyarn and Mrs. Haggard had agreed in
this. He had always stood much in awe
of his father, and had never-given him cause
of offence. It was strange that, knowing
him to be a bastard, his father should have

treated him in all thinfjs as his legitimate

482

heir. Why had his father failed to provide for
him in any way by will? For the apparently
simple reason that he looked upon him as
the old lord's natural successor. If it were
true that he was but a base-born child,
then his father must have been aware of
the fact, and he and Mrs. Haggard must have
been co-conspirators in an ignoble plot.
What possible object could Eeginald Haggard
have had, and by what possible means could
he have induced his wife to be his accomplice
in so abominable a crime ? As he looked
back upon the long years of affection that
the woman, who until to-day he had called
his mother, had lavished upon him, he became
the more bewildered. Could it be possible
that the whole matter was but a hallucination
of his mother's, caused by her recent
bereavement ? That supposition wouldn't
hold water for a moment, for the philanthropic
but notoriously hard-headed Spun-yarn
had actually seen the proofs, and
Spunyarn was an honourable man ; and he

well remembered that Spunyarn himself had
asserted his power of supplying the missing
links in the chain, Was it possible after all
that the mysterious contents of the little
red box would never be discovered and that
he might be still the old man's heir for want
of legal proof to the contrary ? Such a
solution was the best that could be hoped
for. He felt more than ever powerless, ashe
reflected that his future lot remained in
the hands of Mrs. Haggard, the woman who
in his rage and despair he had insulted by
base suspicion and met by an open defiance.
That was a mistake, lie saw it now but too
clearly. But the mistake was not irreparable.
Gradually the policy he should pursue
became more and more clearly marked out
in his troubled mind. " I will not quarrel
with them," he thought ; " I will express my
readiness to do what is right, and should
the contents of the box be ever forthcoming,
then I must trust to their generosity. That
is the simplest and safest way, the only

wise course and the only prudent one ; lie
may after all be bound to secrecy," he
thought.

And then he rang for his breakfast, and
afterwards proceeded to interview his father's
friend. He found Lord Spunyarn in what
had been called Eeginald Haggard's own
room. When Lucius entered it, Lord Spun-yarn
was engaged with a mass of papers.

Spunyarn," he said abruptly, " I owe
you an apology ; I behaved badly yesterday.
Forgive me," he continued, as he held out his
hand, " I behaved badly enough to you,"
he went on, " but I behaved worse to my
mother, for I must call her my mother still,"
he added in a broken voice.

Spunyarn rose and took the offered hand.
Say no more, Lucius, I'm glad you thought
better of it. After all it was a terrible
position for you, my poor boy, a terrible
position for us all," he continued, " and for
her especially."

There's one thing I have to say to you,

Lord Spunyarn," said Lucius, and the crafty
young fellow spoke the words gracefully
and tripphiijly ; " in this matter I can only
place my interests and my honour unreservedly
in your hands. You were my
father's friend, Lord Spunyarn, and you are
his widow's and mine. It is for you, then,
to say what is to be done."

"sone thing must be done, Lucius ; the
honour of the family and of the dead," he
added solemnly, " must be respected."

"That of course," said the young fellow,
as he seated himself and fixed his eyes upon
the carpet.

You will ask for nothing but what is
just, Lucius ; you would not wish to see your
brother wronged ? "

Surely not. Lord Spunyarn, surely not."

It'll have to be done, I suppose, sooner
or later, and perhaps it's better done now.
I don't think I could rake up all the miserable
story in your mother's presence, Lucius,
but you have a right to hear it. A good

deal of the sad little drama was enacted
before my very eyes. I once loved your
mother, Lucius, your real mother, and I
wanted to make her my wife. Lucius, don't
ask me to name her  she is dead, poor girl.
Try to think of your mother, Lucius, as the
life-long victim of a girlish folly, as one who
paid very dearly for her fault. Let us speak
of her no more. I Avill tell you all you need
know. I must tell you, or you would not
be able to take in the situation. Just before
you were born, Lucius, your mother, who
was a dear friend of the much-wronged
woman who sacrificed herself for you, feeling
that her condition could be no longer concealed,
appealed to your father's wife to
save her from the consequences of her fault.
Remember, Lucius, that Mrs. Haggard had
no inkling of the truth that her friend's
lover was her own husband. She never
knew it, poor thing, till he was in his grave.
If she chose to make the great sacrifice
demanded of her, it was in her power to save

her friend's reputation, and your mother,
Lucius, was lier dearest friend. She made
the sacrifice, but when she made it she little
knew the price she would have to pay, for
in sacrificing? herself, she sacrificed the rio-its
of her own then unborn son ; and for twenty
years that poor woman supposed that she
was deceiving, tricking and wronging your
father. But it was not so, Lucius, for your
father was aware of the whole conspiracy
from the very first. Your mother's letters
proved that, and the box contained further
evidence, which rendered doubt upon the
subject impossible. But when my poor
friend was on his death-bed, Mrs. Haggard
could be silent no longer. She, the woman
who had sacrificed her whole life for the sake
of a girlish friendship, on his death-bed, asked
the forgiveness of the man who had wronged
her. Then, and then only, with his dying
breath, your father revealed to her that lie
had been a consenting party to the fraud
and aware of it from the first. And then

lie forgave him, Lucius. What was she
to do, poor thing? At your father's dying
request, I, as his executor, having come into
possession of the secret, handed the proofs
to my friend's widow."

And you saw those proofs. Lord Spun-yarn?"


Yes, I saw them, Lucius."

The young man rose. " Then, Lord Spun-yarn,"
he said, " there is but one course
open to me. As a man of honour I place
myself freely and fully in your hands.
Whatever you think is the right course to
pursue, that course I will follow ; for I
feel, as you told me yesterday, that I have
no rights. My very presence here as my
father's bastard, is an insult to her whom,
I would to heaven, I could still call my
mother, and to the head of the family. I
can say no more than this, Lord Spunyarn
I place myself in your hands."

Spunyarn took the young fellow by the
hand affectionately. " Lucius," said he, " you

are behaving nobly. But the dilemma is
none the less ; the proofs, unfortunately,
have disappeared. I know full well that
you will never have cause to regret your
generosity. Pray God that we may yet be
able to avoid a public scandal. I have sent
for Brookes ; he is, as you know, the old
lord's lawyer, and to him we must come
sooner or later. If we could only get the
contents of the box once more into our
possession, all would be simple enough ; but
the proofs have disappeared, perhaps forever
; and my poor friend's wife, Lucius,
is smitten by a terrible affliction ; they found
her speechless this morning, and the family
practitioner tells me she may never recover.
God knows," he added with a groan, " perhaps
the hand of heaven has closed her
mouth for ever."

"You don't say that she is ill. Lord
Spunyarn, perhaps dying ? '" cried the young
man in an awe-stricken whisper, as he repressed
his exultation with an efFort. " Let

me see lier at once. Poor mother!" lie
added with a sigh.

I verily believe that should fortune desert
young Lucius Haggard he need never really
starve, for his talents as a light comedian
should certainly be worth several guineas
a week to him.

Spunyarn," said Lucius after a pause,
who can have taken these papers ? Have
you any suspicion ? "

It's a mystery I cannot penetrate," he
replied. " Brookes may be able to get at
the bottom of it, however ; I hope and
trust so."

Can it be possible," said Lucius, " that
my mother destroyed the papers herself,
or has secreted them ? "

I hardly think so ; she seemed as much
astonished as I was, when we found them
gone. Besides, why should she destroy
them ? Lucius, she trusted you ; and she
judged you rightly, my boy; you have
chosen the only honourable and manly

course. No man has cause to regret running
straight in this world. You will never
have reason to repent of it, Lucius."

Do you think no one outside the family,
Lord Spunyarn, by any possibility can be
in possession of the key to the secret ? "

No one. Besides it interests no one,
save my dear old friend, your brother, and
yourself."

Yes, I suppose after all George is my
brother, in a sort of way, still."

George will never forget that he is
your brother, Lucius."
There was a pause.

Let us go to her," said Lucius Haggard
with a sigh.

The elder man consented, and they left
the room.

c9 l)-t>--

ENTER MR. BROOKES.

When Lord Spunyarn and Lucius entered
Mrs. Haggard's room they found her stretched
upon a sofa, and to the inexperienced eye
she presented very much her ordinary appearance
; but as the young fellow, who
had been nursed and tended by the invalid
when he was a helpless friendless child,
gazed upon the woman who had been a
mother to him, he saw that one corner of
the mouth was slightly drawn. The old
lord was seated by her side ; her left hand
was clasped in his ; the marks of recent
tears were on the face of the old nobleman,
and he roused himself with an effort to
welcome his heir.

Mother," said the young fellow, as he
took her other hand, " poor mother ! " And

even the long-headed youth felt a pang, ashe
gazed upon the wreck before him.

An answering smile illumined the suffering
face as she heard the greeting.

Then there was a pause of some length ;
and then the old man made his moan, for
the selfishness of age is as natural as the
selfishness of childhood. This is what the
possessor of countless wealth, and of all
the heart could desire to obtain, said in his
cracked querulous old voice :

"All gone from me, wife and son, and
nephews, all taken ; and now she is stricken
down, the joy of my dotage, the comfort
of my old age. It's very hard to bear,"
groaned the old man, and the hollow old
eyes became moist again. But there was
an answering pressure from the slender
hand which he held between his wrinkled
fingers, and the old man's face was lighted up
once more by a happy smile. " You won't
leave me, George," he continued, "for I
can't spare you, my dear, I can't spare you."

Again there came trio same answering pressure.
But lie spoke no word ; heaven had
set the seal of silence on her lips ; tlie}
moved, those pale lips, but no sound came
from them ; and then the sufferer made an
impatient gesture. As she did so young
George Haggard entered the room ; his
eyes were red with weeping and he trod
daintily upon the carpet, as a man would
do dio feared to disturb a sleeping child
The sick woman smiled as he came to his
brother's side and affectionately placed his
hand upon Lucius Haggard's shoulder ; her
eyes sought those of Lord Spunyarn, dwelt
upon his an instant, aud then the lids closed
upon the yet lovely orbs, and still smiling,
like a tired child, Mrs. Haggard sank into
a peaceful sleep.

No word was spoken by those around the
couch ; they sat silent, fearing to disturb her
slumber. As Lucius Haggard gazed upon the
sweet sleeping face, he was racked by torturing
doubt. How would it all end? Would

she recover her bodily health again ? The
mind was evidently still uninjured. Would
she ever speak a(/ain? That was the important
question to Lucius Laggard. The
papers gone and the mouth of this one witness
closed, he felt himself comparatively safe ;
still in the eyes of the law and of the world
his father's lawful heir. But should she
speak again, she might communicate the
secret of his shame. Without her evidence
all that Lord Spunyarn might say could
but be mere surmise, a simple ex parte-statement.


One by one they left her sleeping, the
old earl leaning heavily on the arm of Haggard's
eldest son. And then they separated ;
the old lord to his slumbers and his dreams
and the society of the faithful Wolf, the
two young fellows to the park, to wander
up and down the great avenue side hv
side, and talk with bated breath over their
fresh misfortune, the affliction that lead

befallen their mother ; while Lord Spun-vol.
ni. 49

yarn returned to the examination of the
mass of papers lying on the dead Eeginald
Hasofard's table, and to wait with impatience
the arrival of the family solicitor.
If there is a thing in this world that
I hate," said old Mr. Brookes to his partner,
as he sat in his cosy private room in
Lincoln's Inn Fields that morning, " it's
this modern system of telegrams ; they're
almost as bad as a doctor's night-bell. You
have to go, whether you like it or not.
Here's probably some simple matter of common
law. Why on earth can't he write?
Not a bit of it, he simply wires me, and
I have to go," and he handed a telegram
across the table :

Walls End Castle.
"Please come down at once. Your presence
urgently needed.

Spunyarn."

'why can't they write?"

That afterriooii saw old Mr. Brookes at
the Castle. He dined tke-a-tele with Lord
Spunyarn, and did full justice to the cook's
efforts. Lawyers are always epicures, and
Mr. Brookes condescended to praise the
supreme de volaille of the Walls End chef.
After dinner they drew their chairs to the
fire, and then Lord Spunyarn opened his
business.

I'm glad you have come, Brookes ; I'm
very glad you've come."

Something very serious, I suppose ; something
so urgent, Lord Spunyarn, that you
couldn't have written me a letter and got
my advice by the next post," and Mr.
Brookes chuckled.

'' Yes, Mr. Brookes, it was something so
serious that I had to see you in person.
I fear there is a screw loose in the succession."


Gad, sir, you don't mean that Hetton

teas married after all ? "

No, it's not that. Since my pour friend

492

Haggard's death, Mr. Brookes, I have been
placed in a very difficult position. On his
deathbed Haggard desired me to place a
box containing letters and certain reminiscences
of a bygone intrigue in his wife's
hands. There is nothing very extraordinary
in that you will say ; the man was sorry
for his youthful error, and sought forgiveness.
Quite so, but that was not the end
of the matter." Spunyarn described to the
old lawyer the contents of the box, the
miniature, the mask, the earrings, and the
packet of letters. " Mr. Brookes," lie continued,
" as my friend's executor it was
perhaps my duty to have gone through
those letters, but they were the love-letters
of a dead woman to my own dead friend,
and I myself lead at one time, long long
ago, been seriously attached to the lady.
I hadn't the heart to go through those
letters. I see now, that I neglected or
avoided what was a very painful duty. I
as mv friend's executor should have cared

for those letters, verified tlieni, and put
them in a ]place of safety'. ]\Iy only excuse
is that my dying friend's words to me were,
'Hand the red morocco box in my safe to
my wife, the contents are important ; remember
my affair at Ivome and you will
understand them ; George must do as she
pleases in the matter.' And then he died.
I take it, Mr. Br()okes, that it was my duty
to carry out my dying friend's injunctions.
I did carry out those injunctions t( the
letter, and then I became aware of an
astounding thing. Young Lucius Haggard
is not the heir to the Pit Town title, for he
is illegitimate ; nav, more than that, he is
not Mrs. Haggard's son at all."

The lawyer sprang from his (chair. " Do
you mean to assert, Lord Spunyarn, that he
was substituted by the supposed parents?
On the face of it, Lord Spunyarn, it's an
improbable story, almost an impossible
story."

Let me explain, Mr. Brookes. Lucius

Haggard is really the son of Mrs. Haggard's
dearest friend. When, in a moment of desperate
fear and agitation, in her love for
her friend she consented to cover that
friend's terrible position  she was an inexperienced
girl, Mr. Brookes  by personating
the child's mother, she had not the
slightest idea of the terrible complications
that vrould ensue, and that the child's father
was her own husband ; that latter fact she
never knew until my poor friend, suddenly
stricken down, with his dying breath hinted
at the terrible secret, and asked for her
forgiveness."

The lawyer moved uneasily in his chair,
but did not attempt to interrupt Lord Spun-yarn's
explanation.

"I acknowledge to you, Mr. Brookes," he
continued, " that I committed an error ; I
should have done at once what I am doing
now, and taken you into our confidence.
But the good name of a woman was at
stake, the proofs were in our possession,

there was no doubt as to the illegitimacy
of Lucius Haggard, and I trusted in his honour
and to the affection he bore to the woman
who had been a mother to him, to enable
us to tide over the matter without disclosing
it to a living soul, at least during Lord
Pit Town's lifetime."

And you were disappointed, Lord Spun-yarn
; you forgot the magnitude of the stake,
when you deliberately placed the honour
of a noble family, the succession to a title
and immense estates, in the hands of an
interloper."

"No, Mr. Brookes. At first Lucius
Haggard refused to believe for an instant
what would naturally seem a most improbable
story. A terrible scene of violence
ensued, but let me do young Lucius justice :
lie speedily came to his senses ; his conduct,
Mr. Brookes, was all that one could expect
from a man of the very highest honour.
He placed himself unreservedly in my
hands."

Thank God for that'* said the lawyer,
as he wiped his forehead with this big silk
handkerchief, " thank God for that, for it
simplified matters very considerably. And
now I suppose you want me to break the
matter to the old lord. We've had a very
narrow escape, Lord Spunyarn."

I fear we're not out of the wood yet,"
said Spunyarn meditatively.

What ! further complications ? "

Unfortunately, yes. Mrs. Haggard is
suffering from a stroke of paralysis and is
speechless."

Well, there is still your evidence and
the contents of the box ; besides, you say
that Lucius Haggard will not fail you."

"Mr. Brookes, the worst yet remains to
tell ; the contents of the box have disappeared'"

Again the lawyer rose to his feet deeply
agitated. " Lord Spunyarn," said he
solemnly, " you have much to answer for.
No doubt Lucius Haggard has possessed
himself of the evidence the box contained

and has destroyed it. Just think for an
instant of the immense temptation to him
to do so. There may be, there will be, a
gigantic law-suit that may never end, while
the whole of the vast property may be
frittered away, for in a matter such as this,
remember, all costs come out of the estate.
Lord Spunyarn, what yon tell me is not a
misfortune, it is an appalling calamity, and
Lucius Haggard alone has the key of the
situation. It's not a time for half measures,
Lord Spunyarn ; we must attempt to obtain
from him the contents of the box, even if
we have to employ violence."

Calm yourself, Mr. Brookes," said Lord
Spunyarn, " Lucius Haggard at least is wholly
guiltless in the matter. He was unaware
even of the existence of the box and its
contents until he saw it in Mrs. Haggard's
presence. We revealed to him the story,
and when we opened the box, that he might
see the proofs as he surely had a right todo,
it was empty."

The lawyer stared at Lord Spunyarn.
And what is your lordship's opinion," he
said, " in the matter ? Let me understand
you exactly. Lord Spunyarn. You handed
the box and its contents to Mrs. Haggard.
She can testify to that ? "

Mr. Brookes, she is speechless."
If we had only got the letters you speak
of, with affidavits in proper form from yourself
and the wife of the deceased man, and,
Lucius Haggard being a consenting party, by
the expenditure of a good deal of money,
we might perhaps tide the matter over ; as
it is. Lord Spunyarn, there is no evidence,
absolutely no evidence. All you have to
tell, is mere hearsay and conjecture; and it
would doubtless be successfully set up that,
accepting your version of the communication
made to you by Eeginald Haggard on
his deathbed, unsupported as it is by a
tittle of evidence, it was but the incoherent
raving of a dying man. A Committee
of Privilege of the House of Lords

would not accept mere ex parte statements
in so serious a matter ; there would have
to be absolute proof, legal proof, mind you,
proof that would satisfy the law officers
of the Crown. Young Lucius Haggard, even
if he were so Quixotic as to wish to do so,
could not sign away an earldom by a mere
stroke of the pen, neither could he strip
himself of the entailed estates. The extraordinary
events, that you say took place
many years ago, would have to be proved ;
and who is to prove them ? As to the
parties themselves, two of them are dead,
while the third unfortunately is unable to
give evidence one way or the other. If I
communicate this dreadful thing to my aged
client, it may actually kill him. What is
your own opinion. Lord Spunyarn ? Do
you suppose that in a temporary aberration
of mind, to take a most favourable view of
it, Mrs. Haggard, with a woman's natural
fear of exposure, destroyed or secreted the
contents of the box? Eerinald Harvard we

know devised all this property to this son
George, which was the least he could do
after stripping him of everything he had
the right to inherit (I am taking your strange
story for gospel for a moment). Can we
think that Mrs. Haggard (still supposing
the story to be true) felt herself bound to
be her husband's accomplice in robbing her
own son of his just rights, and so become
the principal actor in an abominable conspiracy?
You have pieced the thing together
in your own mind, and the whole
story fits charmingly, but it doesn't admit
of proof in any way ; it's little better than
an improbable and romantic tale as it stands
now, without a shadow of documentary or
oral evidence to give it even the semblance
of truth."

Lord Spunyarn interrupted the lawyer
impatiently.

"You don't mean to say that you doubt
the various details that I have given you,
Mr. Brookes?"

I doubt nothing, Lord Spunyarn," replied
the lawyer, "I am merely giving you the
legal view. It Avill be my duty, I fear
there is no escape from it, to communicate
the whole matter to Lord Pit Town, and
to take his instructions ; of course by those
instructions I shall be guided. He may
direct me to attempt to collect evidence in
the matter, for I don't suppose that he
would wish an illegitimate child of his heir
to inherit his title and estates. There is
another view. Lord Spunyarn, a view that
would commend itself to the minds of some
men : ' Let sleeping dogs lie ' is a good
proverb. If Lucius Haggard is, as you
assert, base-born, then it is for George
Haggard to prove his title ; and the real
struggle between the two young men need
only commence when my old friend is laid
in his grave. 01 one tiling I am quite certain,
Lord Spunyarn ; public scandal and litigation,
must, if possible, be avoided, and I am sure
that my client wdl be at one with me in this."

Spunyarn nodded.

It is, of course, possible," continued
the lawyer, " that some third person may
have possessed himself of the contents of
the box from mercenary motives."

And what is your own impression, Mr.
Brookes ? "

Speaking to you, Lord Spunyarn, as
Eeginald Haggard's executor and the guardian
of his infant sons, one of whom
is undoubtedly the hen to the Pit Town
title, speaking as a man unversed in the
ways of women, and supposing that Lucius
Hacrcrard was unaware of the alleged contents
of the box, I am inclined to suspect
that Mrs. Haggard holds the key to the
mystery"

You mean that she has secreted or destroyed
what the box contained ? "

The lawyer nodded.

Mr. Brookes, my poor friend's wife
would never commit a dishonourable act."

A woman's ideas of honour. Lord Spun-yarn,

are peculiar. With them, as a rule,
particularly with the best of them, sentiment
often takes the place of what men
call honour. You yourself have told me
that this unhappy lady considered herself
bound by an oath to Lucius's mother, accepting
for the moment the theory that
she herself is not his mother. If she would
keep the secret for twenty jesivs, Lord
Spunyarn, if there was a secret, she may
carry it with her to her grave, repenting
the sudden confidence that you state she
made to you. Even supposing that the
power of speech should return to her, she
may decline to confirm upon oath the statement
made to you. The very fact of her
suffering from paralysis may be used by
Lucius Haggard and his advisers to set up
a theory that she is of unsound mind ; and
a very natural theory, too, I take it," said
the lawyer with a sigh. " Lucius Haggard,"
he continued, " a minor, under the influence
which you and Mrs. Haggard would naturally

exert upon him, may be a very
different person to deal with from Lucius
Haggard acting under professional advice,
and only biassed by his own interests. I
fear, should the matter ever come before
the public, that very strong reflections indeed
will be made upon you and Mrs. Haggard.
Beati presidents. Supposing that Lord
Pit Town should elect to either honore the
matter altogether, or simply instruct me to
seek for further evidence ; in a very short
time indeed, for his lordship is a very old
man, Lucius Haggard will come into the
title and estates as a matter of course ; it
will then be for George to attempt to
prove his right. We must be careful,
Lord Spunyarn, in attempting to set ourselves
up as an amateur court of law, that
we do not ruin the fortunes of a great
house by leaving it absolutely without an
heir ; for suppose young George Haggard
to die, and supposing for an instant that
the story you have told me could ever be

proved, that is what would happen. Why,
the very title would cease to exist, and the
estates would possibly revert to the Crown.
Are you and I, Lord Spunyarn, justified insetting
the match to a train which might
extinguish an ancient peerage? If I speak
to you as a man of the world, and give
you my honest opinion, I do not hesitate
to say that the best thing that can happen
is, that these papers, whatever they contain,
may never come to light."

"You would not go as far as to suggest,
Mr. Brookes, that should we discover the
papers we are to destroys them? "

Xo, Lord Spunyarn. God forbid ! I
don't go as far as that. You, as your
friend's executor, through a strange carelessness,
for I can call it no less, have let
the contents of the box out of your possession;
of course it is for you to do your
utmost to refrain them. If you ever succeed
in doing so, it seems to me that young
George Haggard will be called upon to elect

VOL. HI. 60

his own course. I don't think there is any
use in prolonging this interview," he continued
; " I must see his lordship, of course,
in the morning ; and should he consent, and
I trust to his strong common sense that he
will do so, we shall be able to advise with
you in the matter. He may, however, object
to that, in which case you will of course
obtain professional assistance and take your
own course."

Spunyarn felt that the man who addressed
him had ceased to be Mr. Brookes, the old
friend of the family, and that he had relapsed
into his real position of Lord Pit
Town's legal adviser.

The two men shook hands ; and it is not
to be wondered at if neither slept very well
that night, both having abundant food for
reflection.

THE HOLLOW BEECH TREE.

Curiosity is not, as is popularly supposed,
the private and peculiar failing of the female
sex. Most men tear up their letters ere
they consign them to the waste-paper basket ;
the wiser and more suspicious portion of the
human race burn them. If Bluebeard had
confided the key of the Blue closet to anyone
of his servants, we may rely upon it that
they would have been just as certain to have
investigated the contents, as the nameless, but
indiscreet, lady, whose sister's name was Ann.
Mr. Capt was a very superior servant, but
like most servants he was innately curious.
The little red morocco box, which he had
never seen opened, which had always accompanied
his deceased master on his numerous
journeys, and which was habitually kept

50-2

in his master's iron safe, had always puzzled
him. It's not very much to be wondered at,
then, that when Mr. Capt saw the box upon
the table in Mrs. Haggard's boudoir, with
its key standing invitingly in the lock, he
should seize the opportunity to take a peep
at its contents. When Capt saw what those
contents were, being an unscrupulous man,
he hesitated not an instant in becoming their
possessor. With men such as Capt, change,
as the French call it, is a favourite mode of
obtaining wealth. We know how Capt had
blackmailed Lucy Warrender for years, and
how he was a past-master in the art. We
know, too, that Capt meditated a still grander
coup. The secret he possessed had been a
little fortune to him during poor Lucy's lifetime,
and, Uke the shares of a successful mine,
Mr, Capt's secret had developed in value with
astonishing rapidity. But Capt was a timid
as well as a cautious man ; he lead a holy
horror of the terrors of the law. The secret
he had to sell was a valuable one, it is true.

but the chain of proof was incomplete. Capt
could show that the ladies had gone to Auray
in a mysterious manner. Capt could swear
that Miss Warrender, under the threat of
exposure, had made no secret to him that
she was the mother of the boy Lucius ; but
who Lucius's father was, had been to Mr.
Capt an impenetrable mystery. And as Mr.
Capt rubbed his hands at the thought of
the disclosures he could make and their
great pecuniary value, his smile of delight
would fade at the reflection, that though all
he swore might be perfectly true, yet, like
the inspired Cassandra, he might fail to And
anybody to believe him. Great then was
Capt's delight at getting possession of the
miniature which represented Lucy Warrender
in her Watteau costume, for it opened upto
him the means of placing his own evidence
beyond a doubt, by adding to it the probably
unwilling testimony of Lord Spunyarn, a
witness who would be above suspicion. His
master's monogram upon the portrait case,

followed by the single word " Eine " and
the date, brought back all the facts distinctly
to his mind. He remembered actually looking
on with his own eyes, disguised as he
was as a Eoman warrior, upon the fracas
between Haggard and the unfortunate Mons.
Barbiche at Papayani's ball ; he had seen
the blue domino upon Haggard's arm, and
he had gazed with curiosity, striving to
penetrate the secrecy of the very mask
which was now in his possession. Probably,*
he thought, Lord Spunyarn was Haggard's
confidant in the whole matter, but when
he read the packet of letters all doubt was
set at rest, and Mr. Capt felt that the
honour of a noble family was his to traffic
with, and that all that remained was to
look out for the best bargain. Mr. Capt
then secreted his prey at once. Secure
now in the possession of the power of
proving what he had to tell, he had but
to take his merchandise to the best market
and dispose of it to the highest bidder.

Unfortunately for the valet, there were
only a few possible purchasers for the
valuable commodity he had to sell. There
was the old lord, but Capt doubted
whether Lord Pit Town mioht feel disposed
to invest his money in proving the
eldest son of his own deceased heir to bea
bastard. As for Mrs. Haggard, dealings
with her were out of the question, for she
was prostrated by the stroke of paralysis.
Then Capt's mind reverted to old Warrender,
but he thought with horror of the collection
of antiquated horsewhips which hung
in the entrance-hall of The Warren, and he
remembered that Squire Warrender, though
a very old man now, had a vigorous arm,
and that he was a justice of the peace.
The other possible purchasers that remained
were the two young men, but unfortunately
both were under age, and, therefore, comparatively
penniless ; so Mr. Capt, reluctantly
enough, was compelled to defer negotiations
to Lord Pit Town's death, or, at all events,

until Lucius Haggard's majority, and lie
determined whichever of those events might
happen first, that Fie would then realize his
property at once.

Capt had reluctantly made up his mind
to wait ; he carefully packed up the contents
of the little box which he had purloined,
including the brilliant earrings, for
he feared to dispose of them, though they
were very valuable, lest he might be accused
of, and punished for, a robbery.
Besides the earrings were a part of the
proofs. It was quite a neat little parcel he
made, and he carefully covered the whole
with waterproof canvas, lest the valuable
contents of the packet might be damaged
by weather. Mr. Capt had determined to
place his property in a temporary hiding
place, for he argued rightly that Lord
Spunyarn, as soon as he was aware of the
robbery that had been committed, would
leave no stone unturned to regain possession
of the deposit he had so carelessly guarded.

Nature had provided Mr. Capt with a
hiding-place suitable in every way to his
designs. In the most secluded portion of the
park, whither he was accustomed to resort
to meditate and smoke his master's cigars in
secret, was a very picturesque beech. At
about the height of a man in the trunk of this
vigorous young tree was a hole some eighteen
inches deep, just large enough to admit a
man's hand. Into this natural hiding-place
Mr. Capt remembered to have once himself
thrust his fingers from curiosity. It was
not without some hesitation that he placed
his property in the cavity, and to make
assurance doubly sure he covered the
packet with a few dead leaves and closed
the mouth of the hole with a big stone,
upon which he artistically placed a little
layer of living moss, carefully smoothing
down the edges of the tuft with his fingers.
And then Mr. Capt became once more a
waiter upon Providence.

The explosion which Mr. Capt had

expected took place. The sudden summoning
of the family lawyer, and the
striking down of Mrs. Haggard by paralysis,
had sufficiently informed him of the fact.
He felt certain that a vigorous perquisition
would ensue, and it was with considerable
satisfaction, that he reflected that he had
been beforehand in the matter, and that
he had placed, what he looked upon as
his property, in safety.

The interview between Lord Pit Town
and his solicitor was a lomb one. The old

o

lord was naturally much agitated. As was
to be expected, he placed himself unreservedly
in the hands of his legal adviser,
and he determined not to move in the
matter.

You seem to think, Brookes," he said,
that there is nothing to be done in this
thing."

Certainly not, my lord," Mr. Brookes
replied. " The late Mr. Reginald Haggard's
widow, should she recover possession of her

faculties, which her medical adviser has
informed me is extremely doubtful, would
be able assuredly to give us the solution
of the mystery ; till then, or till her death,
it is my opinion that we can take no
action whatever. It is certainly not for us
to throw any doubt upon the legitimacy of
the young man, whom you must perforce
continue to look upon as your lawful heir.
Of Lucius Ha;?oard's silence for his own
sake, we may be certain. Lord Spunyarn
we may trust, while Mrs. Haggard herself
will assuredly reveal nothing until her health
is in some measure restored, and then only
probably under considerable pressure from
you, if you should, under the circumstances,
consider such a course advisable. If there
really was a secret, Lord Pit Town, we
can rely upon the discretion of a woman
who has kept it for twenty years. But
after all it seems to me that it is only the
distant branches of the family who suffer
in losing a remote contingent succession;

even if the extremely unlikely history which
Lord Spunyarn gave me is a fact, and true
in all its details, Lucius Haggard is still
Eeginald Haggard's son. It seems to me
that it is not for us to stir up the question
of his legitimacy. Possibly your lordship
might feel inclined to put pressure upon
him, and make him covenant not to marry
in his younger brother George's lifetime,
and so the title and entailed estates would
eventually pass to George Haggard or his
heirs."

That is, of course, supposing the story
to be true," quavered the old lord.

It is impossible, my lord, in the absence
of the documents, for us to take any notice
of the story. I may attempt, if you wish
it, to obtain information. I might sound
the late Mr. Haggard's valet, though I think
it would be extremely bad policy to do so.
As for George Haggard, my lord, he is his
father's heir, and you and I, my lord,
know that the present disposition of your

lordship's property will amply compensate
him for the loss of the Pit Town title and
the Walls End estates, even if they were
really his by right."

Yes, Brookes, I suppose things must
take their course."

His lordship's remark showed that he
accepted Mr. Brookes' point of view. The
lawyer communicated the old man's decision
to Lord Spunyarn, but the matter itself was
never mentioned between Lord Pit Town
and the executor of his late heir.

Young Lucius Haggard for the last few
days had had plenty of food for reflection.
The agony of mind which he had suffered
when Lord Spunyarn had broken to him
the strange story of his birth was more
than counterbalanced by the disappearance
of the proofs and the opportune
illness of his father's widow. He found
himself once more the heir apparent, and
so temporary had been his degradation that
it seemed but a fevered dream. Whether

the story was true or false, probably no
one would ever know. The more he thought
of the matter, the more young Lucius Haggard
congratulated himself on having controlled
his feelings after his first natural
burst of passionate indignation. He had
not alienated Lord Spunyarn, he had not
quarrelled vith any one ; his conduct, under
the most trying circumstances, had been
such as to merit the respect of all concerned.
Though he had not yet won the
rubber, he had decidedly scored the first
game.

As time rolled on, Reginald Hasorard's
widow made no perceptible progress towards
recovery. The speechlessness continued ; she
was still unable to articulate. At first she
frequently attempted to speak, but gradually
ceased her efforts, as she found that it was
practically impossible to express herself.
When she tried to write, although the
fingers could grasp the pen, she was unable
to produce written characters, but she appeared

to hear and to understand perfectly.
Her memory, too, seemed to have failed
her, for she no longer attempted to express
her grief at her husband's death. She lead
lost to a certain extent also the power of
motion, and was confined to her couch.
With this exception, her bodily health remained
good, and there was no visible
change in her appearance.

No intimation of the supposed discovery
of a family mystery had been made to old
Squire Warrender, not that there was any
doubt as to his discretion, but simply
because there was nothing to be gained by
disturbing the old man's mind with so
terrible a communication. Squire Warrender
had hurried to the Castle to visit his
daughter when he first heard of her
seizure ; but as the fears of an immediate
fatal termination gradually wore off, the
old squire had returned to King's Warren.
But the two young men, as was natural,
still remained at the Castle in close attendance

upon their mother ; George, from
natural affection, while Lucius, though he
longed to taste the sweets of his newly-acquired
liberty, felt that it was to his
interest to remain upon the spot in the
unlikely contingency of Mrs. Haggard regaining
her faculties.

While the minds of many of the inhabitants
of Walls End Castle had been disturbed
in the manner narrated, the quiet little
parish of King's Warren had been shaken
out of its ordinary state of somniferous
torpidity. To use Mrs. Dodd's words, " the
government of the country lead at last
become awakened to the important services
rendered to the Church by my dear father."
The fact is, that a bishopric had fallen in,
and that the Prime Minister, a notorious
talker and time-server, and a very old
servant of Her Majesty, was extremely
anxious to perpetrate a great and glorious
job. But the Prime Minister was a wiseman
; he knew very well that in trying

to please every-body he would satisfy no
one, and so he meant to please himself,
and to appoint to the vacant see an old
college chum of his own, a learned but harmless
enthusiast, now a Don, dio had once
in his life perpetrated a very abstruse work
upon the Greek particle. The first thing
that the Prime Minister did was to lend an
apparently willing ear to the suggestions
of the various busybodies who under such
circumstances always favour unfortunates in
his position with their disinterested ideas
upon the subject. Deputations from the
two rival missionary societies waited upon
him, lords temporal and lords spiritual
had private interviews with him, and the
heads of his party expressed their opinions
to him freely but confidentially ; he promised
to give their suggestions what he
called his earnest consideration, and then
he bowed them out. But the Prime Minister
was a man who invariably killed two birds
with one stone. " I will obtain some cheap

VOL. UL 51

popularity," lie thought, " and several good
rounds of universal applause, by a masterstroke.
I will offer the bishopric to a
simple parish clergyman." In the clerical
world, to use a profane phrase, there were
at least half-a-dozen favourites in the betting,
and as many dark horses. When the Thunderer
appeared with an inspired article
upon the fitness of a successful parish
clergyman for the more onerous position
of a bishop, great was the humming and
disturbance in the clerical hive. Profound
was the disappointment in the minds of the
drones and dignitaries. Men who were
performing archidiaconal functions heaped
dust and ashes on their heads, crying aloud
that the interests of the Church were being
sacrificed to obtain an ephemeral popularity.
But the breasts of the working bees throbbed
wdtli excitement ; the vicars of parishes who
had been long in harness, and had never
met with the expensive misfortune of being
haled by their bishop, or the terrible aggrieved

parishioner, under the Church Discipline
Act, before that greatest of all clerical
bogies, Lord Penzance, and who would never
have thought of undergoing six months'
imprisonment for conscience' sake ; men who
knew a o"ood oiass of wine when they saw
it ; men who were apostles of the Hie
Ribbon Army, fathers of large families of
sons and daughters blessed in having: their
quivers full of them, and Celibates wedded
to the Church alone ; all these men were
racked by ambitious hopes. In the meanwhile
the Prime Minister was occupied in
putting salt on his sparrow's tail : that rare
clerical bird so fast becoming extinct in

o

the present day, rara avis in terris ni(jroqu&

si minima cygno, who should be willing to

reply to him nolo episcopal. The Prime

Minister was looking round for a man of

straw, and after some search he found him

in the person of the Eeverend John Dodd.

The Thunderer had said that "the little

leaven that was needed in the hierarchy

512

of the Church of England, that it mio-ht
leaven the whole lump, was a parochial
clergyman who had unostentatiously laboured
in the clerical vineyard, a man who could
rule his see as he had ruled his parish,"
and after a long diatribe, the article concluded
with these pregnant words : " Such
a man the noble lord at the head of
affairs has found in the well-known vicar
of King's Warren, the Eeverend John Dodd."
And then it compared the Severer id John
Dodd to the " Man of Loss," in its usual
graceful and pointed manner.

Verbal communications, like dead men,
tell no tales.

The Prime Minister didn't write a letter
to the Eeverend John Dodd, he didn't
even send him a halfpenny post-card,
offering him the bishopric ; ]put he did
dispatch a trusted emissary. We must
remember that the Minister had been credibly
informed that the Eeverend John Dodd was
absolutely the only respectable clergy man

ill the Church of Enghaiid, in the full
possession of his mental faculties, who
would be certain to decline the honours
of consecration. Certain Eoman emperors
have earned our respect by refusing to
accept divine honours, and the Prime
Minister heard with delight that the
Eeverend John Dodd was a man of the
same heroic kidney. We have met the
emissary before, it was the same old clerical
friend of the Eeverend John's, who had
on a previous occasion, as his archdeacon,
warned him to set his house in order on
the appointment of a new bishop, a king
who knew not Joseph. He it was, who had
recommended to his friend Dodd that
eminently reliable clerical charwoman, the
Eeverend Barnes Puffin. The Eeverend
Barnes Puffin had done his work well,
things had gone on smoothly ever since in
the parish of King's Warren; and many a
the and oft had the stout vicar, like the
mask'd Arabian maid in the " Licht of the

Harem," exclaimed, " Oh, if there be an
Elysium on earth, it is this, it is this."
I don't believe that the vicar of King's
Warren would have changed places with
the Mikado of Japan. The two clergymen
had their interview ; at which Mrs. Dodd, to
her great indignation, did not assist. Never
before in his life had the Eeverend John
kept a secret so long from the knowledge
of the wife of his bosom, the fair Cecilia ;
until the next morning at breakfast, he
may be said to have continuously wrestled
with her in the spirit. In vain did Mrs.
Dodd alternately beg, command, and even
entreat him with briny tears, to communicate
to her what had taken place in
that secret interview. All she could extract
from him was, that she should know all
about it at breakfast time. She even
tried guessing, but each guess was more
wildly improbable, and wider of the mark
than the last ; her final suggestion was a
rather barbed arrow though.

John," she said in a hissing whisper,
with a vicious nudge, to the poor vicar,
who was vainly seeking sleep for the
twentieth time. "You may keep it from
me if you will, John, but I've guessed your
dreadful secret. Yes," she added with a
succession of sobs, " I've guessed it at last ;
the boo-boo-bishop is going to sequestrate
your living on the ground of your
weakened intellect." But Dodd only
chuckled, or rather " chortled," in his
amusement, as he buried his face in his
pillow.

The next morning* Mrs. Dodd, as washer
custom, entered the breakfast-room
first. She took up the Thunderer, and she
performed her natural duty as a woman,
and went carefully through the list of
births, deaths and marriages ; and then
she came upon the inspired article to
which we have alluded. At first the paper
dropped from her fingers, and then her
face was illumined by a smile of triumph.

The neat parlour maid was just placing the
hissing urn upon the table.

Jane," said Mrs. Dodd, " in future
when addressing your master, be good
enough to say, 'my lord.' You can inform
the others of what I wish done."

The girl dropped Mrs. Dodd a low
courtesy, stared at her, and then stammered
out, " Yes, my lady."

So grateful was this speech to Mrs.
Dodd's feelings that she hadn't the heart
to correct the girl ; she merely smiled
blandly and smoothed her cap ribbons.

The Eeverend John Dodd entered the
room at the moment ; he sniffed and rubbed
his hands, for ambrosial odours from the
kitchen reached his nostrils. His wife
sprang to her feet, and rushing into his
arms after the manner of long-lost daughters
upon the stage, she buried her face in
his Mab. waistcoat. " John, dear John,"
she said through her fears of joy, as she
gazed up at his great round smiling visage,

"let me be the first to congratulate you on
your well deserved honours." She snatched
up the newspaper and waved it wildly
in the air. " I've read it all, John, and
they've put it so nicely. Little did I
dream last night when I spoke to you so
irreverently, for I shall revere you now,
John, that I was speaking to a bishop.
Oh, John," she continued, clapping her
hands in a girlish manner, " 'tis such a becoming
dress, and so, so delightfully exclusive."


Calm yourself, Cecilia," said Dodd, who
feared the shock would be too much for
lier. " Calm yourself, Cecilia, dear. I'm
plain Jack Dodd still ; they did offer it
me yesterday, but I refused it."

"And you can stand there, Mr. Dodd,
and tell me this dreadful thing. Oh, Mr.
Dodd," she said with withering sarcasm,
"I thought just now that I was the wife of
a bishop. Alas, I learn from your lips the
terrible truth, the truth which my poor

father so often impressed upon me, that
I am only married to a fool," and she,
rushed from the room.

I suppose that the parson was after alla
callous stony-hearted man, for though he
breakfasted alone, he devoured the entire
dish of stewed kidneys, which the parlour-maid
had placed upon the table with a
low obeisance.

"M-

MR. CAPT LEAVES SERVICE.

'Mil. Capt bided his time. The quiet respectful
foreign servant showed by no word
or creature that he held the kev to the
mystery of Lucius Haggard's birth. His
duties were almost a sinecure, and though
now he drew his pav from Lucius Sacro-ard,
and was, of course, young Mr. Haggard's
own man, vet he ofave almost as much
attention to the comforts of the younger
brother. Every afternoon Mr. Capt was
in the habit of taking a long walk in the
great park. I don't think it was simply
for love of exercise, or to admire the
scenery, that he was so regular in this
pilgrimages to a particular sylvan glade on
the border of the river Sweir, which
formed the extreme boundary of Lord Pit

Town's home park. The real fact was, that
Capt was in the habit of making a daily
inspection of the place where he had deposited
his treasure. At first he was accustomed
to walk down to the river and
examine the little tuft of moss which he
had so carefully planted over the hiding-place
furnished him by nature in the
beech tree. But he had noticed that he
had worn quite a little path just beneath
his tiny treasure-house ; such carelessness
he remembered might betray him ; so
though he passed the tree every day, he
was careful to avoid his first mistake ; and
as day by day the little tuft of moss grew
greener, for it had now evidently taken
root, Capt gradually inspected the tree just
as carefully but from a greater distance.
From many a point of vantage he could
observe the little green patch, and at
length, by a refinement of ingenuity, he
was enabled to keep away from the
tree altogether. His eternal cigar in his

mouth, lie was accustomed to walk about well
within sight of the beech tree. The spot
was secluded enough when he had first
adopted the hiding - place, but as the
autumn wore on and the leaves fell, Mr.
Capt thanked his stars at his own ingenuity.
Having assured himself that no
one was in sight, Mr. Capt would take a
small opera glass from his pocket, then he
would commence by its aid to admire the
view, he would gaze round at all points of
the compass ; last of all, his glance would
inevitably fall upon the beech tree, the
glass would be fixed steadily upon the
little tuft of moss, and then seeing that it
was undisturbed it would be replaced in
its case, and pocketed with a sigh of satisfaction.
And then Mr. Capt would continue
]his perambulations in a comfortable
frame of mind.

It was one of those bright, brisk, clear
days of early winter, when the sun has
attained sufficient power to make us unbutton

our overcoats, and feel glad if we
had left our neck-wraps at home. Mr.
Capt had just breasted the rising ground
which formed the boundary of the dell
in the direction of the Castle. He stopped,
and placed his hand in his pocket, to draw
from it the glass, and to then commence
his usual artistic studies of the thousand
and one autumn effects of the daily changing
landscape. But before he could get
the glass to his eye, he perceived a figure
standing at the edge of the little swirling
river. There was plenty of water in the
Sweir just now, as it swept through the
rich soft mould here, where it formed the
boundary of the home park. Eobinson
Crusoe's gesture of disgust and fear, when
he saw the first savage upon his island
home, was very similar to that made by
Mr, Capt when he discerned the tall figure
of Blogg, the head keeper, leaning upon
his gun. Eobinson Crusoe was a pious
Englishman, as we know, but Capt being

an irreligious foreigner, gave vent to his
feelings in a continental oath. The keeper's
back was towards Capt, and his eyes were
fixed upon the fast-hurrying waters of the
swollen stream ; the valet, though he was
a good six hundred yards off, retraced his
steps upon tip-toe in his great anxiety not
to attract the keeper's attention. When
he was well out of sight, having put the
rising ground once more between himself
and Blogg, he lighted a cigar, and recommenced
his walk, making a long circuit,
but as if drawn by some irresistible magnetism,
his feet once more, ere the cigar
was finished, brought him to the banks of
the Sweir and the entrance to the dell.
This time Mr. Capt was not so fortunate,
for the keeper's eyes met his the instant
he made his appearance. The fact is that
Blogg had been standing chewing the cud
of his reflections, or possibly thinking
about nothing at all, during the five and
twenty minutes' circuit that Capt had

made. There is a considerable difference
in position between a head keeper and
Ills master's valet. Bloofo- recognized the
fact, for though he didn't touch his hat
to Capt, he didn't presume to shake hands
with him, and he addressed him with
marked deference.

"Morning', sir," he said.

Good morning, Mr. Blogg," replied
the valet affably ; "on duty, I suppose."

Lor' bless you, a keeper's always on
duty ; leastways a head keeper is."

The two men walked along amicably
side by side.

I daresay it seems to you," continued
Blofror " more like loading; than duty, forme
to go touching round the best part
of the day, aye, and at times the best part
of the night, too, with this here gun. Not
that we're troubled much with poachers hereabout,
they're mostly amytoors here, but
they're as full o' tricks as a bag full o'
monkeys. I'm mostly a match for 'em

you know, for I was a regular myself once,
as you can remember. Ah, many's the
dark night as I went out a-wirin' in King's
Warren parish. I don't know as there
weren't more enjoyment in those days. We
were both younger then. Muster Capt,"
said the keeper with a sigh.

Ah, but think of your position now,"
said Capt, who wished to put the man ina
good humour, that he might all the
sooner shake him off.

Position ain't everything. A head

keeper's life is as anxious a time as a

frog's in a frying-pan, a hot frying-pan, ye

mind me ; it's not all tips and perquisites ;

it's information here and information there,

it's night lines in the river and the lake,

its wirin' and steel trapping', when it ain't

ferrettin' and iish-pison, and what with the

boys as sums after the antlers and the

nests, and the children as sums after the

blackberries, and the radicals as keeps a

dog, a man's hands is very full indeed."
VOL. lu. 52

You must have an anxious time," said
the sympathizing Capt.

"Ah, you may well say that," replied
the keeper ; " why, in ray young days the
boys they cum after the nests, and the
men they cum after the game, as is
perhaps natural after all, but now they
sums after everything. They even grubs
up the ferns and the primroses with irons
made a-purpose. Why, one of they fern
chaps would think nothing of clearing half an
acre in a morning'. They comes after the
butterflies with their nets, and a botanizing
with their tin candle boxes, and trespassing'
comes natural to them. Why, only the
other day I caught a feller bottling mud
out of a pond, and a-catchin' newts and
such like. ' What's your business here ? '
I said. ' I'm collecting attic animals,'
said he. ' And I suppose you've got permission
? ' ' Don't you be insolent, my
man,' he said ; and he shakes his finger
at me, for all the world like the Sunday-school

teacher used to shake his finder at
me when I was a little bit of a chap.
Don't you try to stop the march of
science, my man,' says he. 'I don't care
nothing' about the march of science,' says
I; 'but if you don't hand over the pair
of antlers as you've got up your back, I'll
wallop you, master. And after I've walloped
you, you and science can march
where you please.' But what makes my
life a burden to me," continued the keeper,
still airing his grievances, " is vermin."

Capt started.

What with the weasels, the stoats, and
such-like, a man need have his eyes open."

Yes," said Capt ; " you need all your
powers of observation, I suppose."

You're right there," assented the keeper ;
it ain't much as escapes me."

By this time they had reached the middle
of the glen, and were within a dozen
paces of Mr. Capt's secret store - house.
Greatly to the valet's disgust the keeper

nV-now

produced a lump of tobacco from his
pocket, and commenced with his knife to
carefully shred off the quantity necessary
for filling his pipe; he stopped to satisfactorily
complete the delicate operation,
then, with great care, he lighted the little
black clay cutty. The keeper got his pipe
into full swing, the two men were about
to proceed on their walk, but Blogg suddenly
laid his hand on the valet's arm and pointed
at the beech tree.

It's many a man," he said sententiously,
as would walk by that tree and see nothing
particular about it," and he stared at the
tree in curiosity. " Aren't you well. Muster
Capt ? " he said suddenly, as the expression
on the valet's face attracted his attention.

The valet's countenance had become of
an ashen grey, and drops of perspiration
stood upon his brow as he seized the
keeper's arm.

I am feeling very queer," he said.

"You look as if you'd seen a ghost,"

said his friendly fellow-servant. " Take a
pull at that," said Blogg, producing a
small flask from one of the capacious
pockets of his moleskin coat. " I'll get
ye a drop of water," he continued, removing
the little metal cup from the bottom of
the flask.

Half-a-dozen strides brought the keeper
to the banks of the Sweir, but getting
the cup full of water was not such a
very easy matter. The keeper flung himself
upon the turf at the edge of the rapidly
running stream, but ere he did so he
took the precaution to stamp, with one
foot in advance, upon the edge. The reason
he did this was obvious, for the soft bank
was undercut by the rush of waters. He
filled the little cup, and returned with
it to his companion, incidentally remarking,
"The banks are plaguy dangerous just
here. Do ye feel better now ? " he said
with solicitude.

"Yes, I'm better now," said the valet.

You look uncommon bad," returned the
sympathetic keeper.

And I feel so, Blogg," the other replied ;
"give me your arm, I must lean on something.
I think I'll get home at once."

"Just an instant. Muster Capt," said the
keeper ; " there's some artful game or other
been a-doing' with that beech ; some chap
has gone and plugged the hole of it with
a lump of moss ; as like as not he's got
a hopeful of wires there now. I'll just
put my hand in and find out what they've
been up to with it."

Get me home first, Blogg, if you can,"
hurriedly interrupted the valet, clutching
his arm. "I feel," said he, with simulated
anxiety, "I feel as if I were going to
die."

I won't keep ye a minute, Capt, but
duty's duty," answered Blogg.

"Don't be a fool, man," cried the valet in
an authoritative tone ; "there are seven
days in the week, and you can search

the hole, if there is a hole, tomorrow
as vrell as to-day."

But BloGfi' was an obstinate man. " You're

CO

wound masterful, Capt, for a man who
thinks he's a- dying," said the keeper with
an honest laugh. '' I'll see what's in the
hole ; and then, if you ask me, why, I'll
carry you to the Castle pick-a-pack, if you
like.' And then Blogg marched up to
the beech tree and picked the moss away
from the hole. He removed the stone,
and turning to the valet, with a triumphant
guffaw he cried, " I told 'ee so. Muster
Capt. I said as how there was a game
going on," and then he plucked the little
packet from its hiding-place.

Maurice Capt was a determined man.
Should he allow the cherished plan of
twenty years to be ruined by the curiosity
of a clod ? The packet was in the keeper's
hands. Like Ahiaschar's dream of wealth,
all the valet's plans and scheming, all his
fondest hopes of affluence, would be kicked

down in an instant. He well knew the
dogged honesty of the man ; the packet,
now within the keeper's grasp, was as good
as in Lord Pit Town's hands. All this
passed through his mind in the twinkling
of an eye, and as the keeper flung himself
once more upon the ground, the Swiss
valet advanced over the soft turf towards
his prostrate form with noiseless cat-like
step. Maurice Capt had made up his mind.
He flung himself upon the keeper's throat
with the ferocity of a tiger, and proceeded
to attempt to throttle his adversary from
behind. But the keeper was a powerful
man. Although Capt's long fingers were
tightly fixed upon his windpipe, and the
astonished man was taken at a great
disadvantage, yet the keeper did his best
to rid himself of the remorseless adversary
who was savagely attempting to strangle
the life out of him. He couldn't call for
help, and he didn't attempt it; but he
struggled bravely, he drove his heavy

boots into the soft turf, and succeeded
once even in rising to this knees, only to
be forced back again upon his face by
the furious efforts of the Swiss. Blogg's
eyes were nearly starting from his head,
and his mouth literally foamed, from the
cruel tightening grip upon his throat.
But the force of his muscular fingers,
which wrenched in vain at the iron wrists
of the valet, began to relax. Even a
strong man cannot fight long when deprived
of air. As the light of triumph came
into the valet's eyes, for he felt that
slowly but surely he was choking the
very life out of his victim, the vengeance
of heaven suddenly overtook the aggressor.
The overhanging bank of soft earth all
at once gave way ; assailant and assailed,
and the very earth they struggled on,
full with a dull splash into the rushing
stream.

Yet another few seconds, and the long
lithe fingers of the Swiss would have completed

their deadly work. As he felt himself
falling, he relaxed his grasp of the keeper's
throat, ill the natural instinct of self-preservation.
Before his mouth reached the water,
the hapless Blogg got one great draught
of air into his capacious chest, but Capt had
too nearly effected his work, and the keeper
was practically almost insensible. The only
effect of this last breath of life, that chance,
and not the mercy of his adversary, had
given him, was to make his muscular fingers
clutch the struggling wrists of his murderer
with a more vice-like grasp. The assailant
and assailed had now changed places as they
sank beneath the black waters. The valet's
sole efforts now were directed to escape
from the tenacious grip of the still struggling
man. As well might a cur attempt
to shake off an infuriated bull-dog who had
once fixed his remorseless fangs in his
throat. They sank beneath the waters,
and, still violently struggling, reappeared
again and again as they were spun round

and round by the rushing stream. But not
for long.

The 'little packet escaped from Blogg's
fingers and floated rapidly away down the
stream. The would-be murderer sunk
to the muddy bottom dead, and honest
Blogg struck out and scrambled up the
bank of the rushing Sweir.

"Blame me," he cried, as he shook himself
Uke a great water dog, " blame me if
I don't think Muster Capt went clean mad ;
why, he nigh on strangled me," and then
he stared at the hurrying, rushing waters.
Poor chap, he have gone to his account.
I wonder what was in that little bundle
though ! "

*****

The dark waters of the Sweir have closed
for ever over the crafty wretch who had
so lately held the destinies of a noble family
within his grasp. Poor Lucy's secret has disappeared
for ever beneath the raging waters
of the little river. The oath that Lucy

Warrender extracted from her cousin at the
Villa Lambert more than twenty years ago
will have been kept but too well, and the
secret will probably remain for ever undiscovered.
And will young George Haggard
be any the worse, seeing that he is robbed
of his birthright? We know that Lord Pit
Town's will has practically made him a
very wealthy man. The mills of heaven's
justice grind slowly perhaps at times, but
they go on turning and grinding for ever.
Lucius Haggard, who in his black and bitter
heart knows that he is but an undetected
impostor, may never marry, may even predecease
the half-brother who was born in
lawful wedlock. She, the silent invalid,
may yet perhaps speak, or the hollow beech
tree may perchance give up its secret.

Many things can happen in a couple
of years. To-day the old lord and the
German doctor still chat and doze in the
great picture galleries ; and George's mother,

beautiful still in life's sad evening, yet wonders
whether she shall ever meet again in another
world the dead husband who betrayed her,
but whom she has forgiven lone ao. As
she lies on her sofa in the pretty room
heavy with the scent of flowers, which has
been hers for many a long year, her eye
brightens, and the soft colour comes back
momentarily to the pale cheek, as she
hears the manly step of her dear son
George ; her own son, her very ow-n son,
her best beloved.

He is dressed in deepest mourning ; and
he wears it for Lucius Haggard, the man
who would have robbed him of his birthright.


"Mother! dear mother!" he says, as he
gently takes her hand.

There is no more to tell. And now the
prompter claps his hand upon his little
bell, and down comes the green curtain
upon the drama of human love, of human
passion, selfishness and greed, upon the

end of the family mystery with which it
has been the author's privilege to try and
interest the reader.
