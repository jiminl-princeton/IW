WALDINE WRITES

CuRZON Street, December Zrd.

John 

Mon ami John !  I have something of
the greatest importance to tell you. I must
say it at once : it will not be kept back. And
it matters so much. Presently I will tell you
all about everything else and all about the
least of things, me ; but first I must write you
the all-important news. It is this, John : * I
love you,  I love you,  I love you !'

And now I've written it, there seems
nothing more to say; for what else can
matter, what else is worth telling, in comparison
of this 1

I think of you ! ' that seems to come next

best ; I think of you in your home. Already
I have seen something in London that has
reminded me of you. I have looked out of
the window : it rains, and the pavement is
black with wet, and on the dark gloss there is
a bright shine of lamplight. John, when Mrs.
Lupton and I drove past your little house
there was just that light upon its windows.
The sunset glare, reflected on the blackness of
the window-glass, shone like a flame on coal.
When I look at the murky pavement here, and
the lamplight flares upon it, I shall think of
your home always.

Ah ! my love, when shall I not think of it,
when not think of you ? Is there any other
subject of thought but this in all the world ?

You want to know about me : it seems
absurd, but I believe you do. John, what is
there that you want to know ? Invent it, I
will subscribe to it gladly ; but on my life I
can find nothing worth the telling. Have
you not invented me ?  I am so wholly
different to my old self that indeed I think
so I  well, then ! you can invent a story of my

days, and I  I will only say to you,  ' I love
you !  it is true ! '

Your face follows me for ever : if I were dead
it would lead me from my grave. Have you not
lifted me up from darkness to light, Orpheus 
Orpheus  with your song of love ? While you
sing to me shall I ever cease to follow, ' as the
water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps,
anywhere around the globe.' Sing on * Oh
singer, bashful and tender ! . . . I hear your call.'

Some of which is out of a book Mrs.
Lupton gave me to read in the train. Was
it not written of you ?

And now, for you are looking very impatient,
you face that draws my heart, I will try to
write you categorically what has befallen us.

Coming home from the tableaux, I attempted
to tell Aunt Linda something about you : John,
you cannot conceive how difficult it was todo
so. At first I think she fancied that I
was your messenger to her, for she only
said, ' What a pity it is that I have been induced
to act ! ' But when I insisted on it that
you  how shall I say it \  liked me, she was

very angry, and thought it * quite ridiculous.'
Then I said that I  ' liked '  you, and she said
she did not wonder ;  that you were . . . no !
I will not tell you, for fear I should make you
vain ! Next she remembered that I had told
her you cared for me, and she left off praising
you and only said the affair was very odd
and very unfortunate, and that she must beg
of me not to distress her darling saint about
it. On this point she was so impressive that
I promised not to speak to his lordship till she
gave me leave : else certainly I should have
gone and waked him from his sleep to tell him.
What prevailed most with Aunt Linda
was her fatigue : by the time we reached
home she had, I really think, forgotten all I
had told her, and her ' good-night ' to me in
the hall was the farewell of a martyr at the
stake. ' It's over ! ' she said tragically, ' it's
done ; it will be in every paper tomorrow.
And now for rest.' For half an instant I
imagined she was speaking of us  (don't you
think those two wavy letters are the prettiest
in the whole alphabet ?)  I too thought ' It is

over ! it is done !' but I did not sleep  unless,
indeed, it is all a sleep and you the king of
dreams I . . .

In the morning Stephanie came to me with
two announcements. The first, that I was to
go to her ladyship before I went downstairs ;
the second, that his lordship was much less
well and you had driven over to Newton for
the doctor. I thought, at the moment, that
it was only a ruse to prevent our meeting ;
but I do not think so now. I think that
there is something almost divine in Aunt
Linda's foolishness  that it is just because she
does nothing and plans nothing that she
always gets her own way. She is like a
feather on the wind, but the wind blows fair
at the feather's will.

I went to her room at once : she was in bed,
with a hand-glass and a pile of notes by her
side. I think she looks at herself constantly,
while she writes them, in order to be quite
certain that she describes herself accurately in
each one of them. She was very serious about
Lord Grenvers  that sudden change to frost

had brought on agonies of neuralgia and he
could not bear to be spoken to.  John, if you
are ever ill I will talk to you till you are well or
dead, but I will not nurse you, and I will not let
any one else nurse you. This is 'par parentheses,
 About us (observe again the beauty of
the word !) she said no syllable. On the contrary,
she told me to go out for a walk. I
walked to our ash-tree, and somehow expected
to find it still golden. Its bareness made me
sad. You, the sight of whom would have caused
it to blossom like Aaron's rod, were away at
Newton. And for two hours I roamed the
woods in vain. It was icily cold and the day
was empty and dark. I came back to luncheon
so long ago, it seems, is it possible that it
was only yesterday ?  I was told that I must
lunch with her ladyship upstairs. To my
amazement, she was dressed and in the best of
spirits : I felt a wretch beside her, chilled and
lonely as I was. She jumped for joy when I
came into the room.

Oh ! here you are ! ' she said. ' Is not
Charlotte an angel ? Her tableaux have bored

her to such an extent that she's off to London
to-night for a fortnight's fun ; she sent to ask
me to come with her, but of course I can't
leave Grenvers, so  never say I'm not a good
aunt !  I told her you would go instead, and
Stephanie is packing your things already

I said I did not want to go. She answered
that I must : she said his lordship cannot
bear the thought of any one being in the
house during these attacks, which often make
him cry aloud with pain.  ' I am such a
believer in Providence,' she profanely added,
that I recognise Charlotte's trip as providential.
And just think what would become of
us all if we flew in the face of Providence !'

She made such a clever little gesture of
flying, and looked so pretty, that I believe I
burst out laughing. A moment later I felt
inclined to cry, but she gave me no time.
We lunched in her boudoir  where you were
once  and all of a sudden, as if you were a
topic of every-day conversation, she touched
on you. She said, * As soon as ever my dear
saint is better, I shall speak to him about your

future and its advancement I wanted, now
I think of it, to say a thousand things, but I
could not. It seemed irreverent : I did not
even thank her. I cannot tell indeed if she
be thankworthy or not.

And all the rest of the afternoon I was in such
a whirl that I scarcely recollect what happened.
Mrs. Lupton arrived at half-past three, and was
with Aunt Linda while I got ready. AVe left
Netherfield by the 4.40 train, and were established
and at dinner here by a quarter-past nine.
John, you have never been to London, have
you ? I thought not ; it is such a dreary place.
It is entirely empty  empty as the grave 
because you are not here. It is quite cold
and quite dark, whereas at Whiteknyghts it is
sunshine and summer  sunshine and summer
for ever ;  until you come up to see me here,
and then Whiteknyghts will be cold and dark
and the sunshine and summer will be here,
. . because of yoii.

This house is charming : I never imagined
that a townhouse could be so pretty ; it is
warm as a nest ; even the staircase is as full

of ornaments as Aunt Linda's boudoir. And
there are Netherfield flowers in every room.
I feel as if I were an enchanted princess.
But I want to be free from my bondage : I
am tired out already of the fairy palace.

. . Ah ! my love, my love ! how is it
with you in the house with the sunlit windows
the house which I have never entered
and which you have never left ? Have you
any memory there of me, who love you so, to
bear you company? You have your books,
your songs, your pursuits. Do they leave
you any moment for the remembrance of me ?
In your full days is there dwelling-room for
my poor intrusive ghost ? Answer me ; for
indeed I have no other home than in your
heart. Do you know, in any way, the possession
of me that you have taken? Do you
know that I want to make all claims upon you,
to tell you everything, to have you wholly
mine ? That is a little bit of what I wish,
and the rest of it . ah ! the sweet rest ! 

'And the rest' I cannot tell you to-day,
because Mrs. Lupton is calling me. She is

great at organising things, and she has a
bachelor friend in town whom she has driven
in a hansom to see. He appears to have been
at home, and they have made a plan for
to-night into which I perforce enter  I who
should like to sit here all the evening and
think of you.

For I am happy, have no fear ! something
you said to me that night was wrong : ' You
will want riches, pleasures, friends.' John, I
am not like that. I want nothing but you.
After all, were you wrong ? will you not be
all in all to me, your joys my riches, your
tastes my pleasures, your thoughts my friends ?
. . Ah ! yes, at least let your thoughts
befriend me.  Sans adieu,

Waldine de Stair.

And the beginning and the end is this :

I love you.'

IN CURZON STREET

Waldine's letter, although as a recital inadequate,
tells sufficiently well what befell
her as a sequel to the little wind's suggestion,
Mrs. Lupton proving the deus ex machine of
that Providence which Lady Grenvers flattered
with her trust.

Her ladyship, for all her naivete, had
sufficient wit to see that she had thrown her
niece overmuch into the company of a man
who could not remain unmoved by her beauty :
unable at the moment to betake herself to her
husband's counsel, she had appealed to her
neighbour's, but, with an instinct against Mrs.
Lupton's sarcasm, she had not told that lady
even as much as she suspected of Waldine's

tocquade, whereas Mrs. Lupton imagined
that more was made of the affair than need
be. She was interested and amused, though
she was not in the least serious. But she had
taken a fancy to Yal, and she was good-natured
enough to hurry her departure to get the girl
out of Lord Grenvers' way during the period
of his pain. It was his pain which had most
weight with her. Moreover, she liked sudden
flights and impromptu plans. The flights had
a mysterious air, which gave her a reputation
for Bohemianism in the county. She made
them alone, sometimes, just for the sake of the
talk and stir that they caused. Curzon Street
was always ready and there was generally something
at the theatres ; it was good for the few
servants she left in London to be taken by
surprise  the larger staff* at Netherfield would
be occupied in setting the rooms to rights after
their disarrangement ;  Mr. CoUington and the
other ' second selves ' could do the honours to
her departing guests, whom also it was no small
joy to mystify ; and she could see one or two
newspaper men in London to describe her

classic and oriental pictures ' to them byword
of mouth, which might or might not add
colour to their reports.

In the meantime she said nothing to Waldine
about John Lyne. Mrs. Lupton was a
woman of her word, and she had promised
Lady Grenvers not to enter on the topic. In
her heart of hearts she was rather intrigues
and would incline to foster this fancy and not to
crush it ; she was not unaware of the fostering
effect of silence while she kept silence. Silence
was in her bond, but that the silence should
signify approval or disapproval had not been
stated.

Who is it,' she had said to Waldine in
the train, ' who says that love " keeps out the
cold better than a cloak, it serves for food and
raiment ? " Longfellow, I think. Yes. It is
not particularly well said, and if I were a
fashionable woman I should laugh at it ; but
I incline to think it is true'  a remark which,
made concerning Lord and Lady Grenvers,
had taken a different channel in the girl's
thought, and occupied her mind and heart fora

considerable part of the journey. She also
thought it true.

Something of that fruit-like quality, distinguished
in relation of her beauty, there was
in Waldine's soul, if one might so distinguish
it. She had a healthy soul, not a morbid or
starved soul ; but its very ripeness was its
danger. The touch that impressed it bruised
it. It was like a peach without a stone.
Mrs. Lupton had the soul of a walnut,
riddled and wrinkled with impressions which
only went towards its hardening and its
flavour ; while Lady Grenvers' soul (very deep
down indeed) was like the pip of a pear.
With Waldine as yet, perhaps always a little,
soul and body were indiscriminate and interchangeable.
Touch with her meant thought,
and utterance followed hard on impulse.
Hardly could she feel things mentally which
did not reach her through the body  contrariwise
when her mind was moved the body
flushed or shivered. Love had reached her
through the senses, not through the convictions
; but the senses influenced her thoughts

till they were mere strings of Love's lute.
The hours which immediately succeeded John
Lyne's first kiss  whether waking or sleeping
hours  were literally love-laden ; the animation
of her mind was suspended and her every
movement listless and relaxed. Body and
soul became twin servitors of sense.

And when she had, to some extent, recovered
tone, she found she was a different
woman. New sympathies were awakened in
her, not finer alone, but wider of scope than
the old ones, and they were all at present
under the dominion of the one absorbing
interest. The love of this girl became at
once not only a full-grown passion, but her
entire self. What was done with her she did
not greatly care. They might take her away
to London or elsewhere ; she had never been
hardly used, and she could not understand
disappointment or deprivation ; she had found
and appropriated a new life wholly hers ; she
had no misgivings. No doubt it was partly
youth that made her take things so easily and
so contentedly pursue the inexpedient. She

VOL. II. 20

was unconscious, to some degree, of the way
of the world ; she was sufficiently conscious of
it to take a pleasure in defying it  that was
all. To write expansively and glory in sending
the letter fully signed  this was the first
result of the new influences. Had she stopped
to analyse her mental condition, as at other
times she was fond of doing, she might have
made the discovery that she went near to
rejoicing at the separation which gave her an
opportunity of writing so fully and so decisively.
But at this extreme of sensation
she analysed nothing ; she only acted or was
inactive as her new self moved her. Mrs.
Lupton, who, to her own never-ending regret,
always had her emotions thoroughly in
hand however much she pretended to let
them go, could not have understood Waldine's
state had its manifestations been evident.
If she could have understood it she would
not have rested till she had tried to attain
to it and broken her heart at finding it
eternally elusive to such a nature as hers.
Thus, with the best or the worst of intentions,

she could never prove a thorough friend
to Val.

But at least she could amuse her. London
to Mrs. Lupton, at all events out of the season,
was not the treadmill of routine. It was a
Pandora's box, perhaps of evils, certainly of
pleasures, out of which she caught the flying
moments without saying ' stay ' to any one of
them. To have an immense fund of occupations
for choice, and then, often enough, to
choose none of them but something entirely
different, was Mrs. Lupton's notion of the
freedom of will in London or Paris. She
could not behave thus to the limited and
formal county engagements, with which her
Netherfield sojourn was starred.

Something for every half-hour of the day,'
she often said, ' I like to feel that, in the mornings
: I like to have my little '* scheme " that
proves to me that there is no moment from
morning to night when somebody does not particularly
wish to see me. And then I like for
some one to come in  perhaps a stranger, perhaps
an old friend (I think preferably a stranger)

with something that is scarcely a plan to
propose  a stroll in Kensington Gardens, a
visit to a studio  some one with just the
influence of the moment upon him'  (Mrs.
Lupton was great upon the influence of the
moment)  'How gladly one throws over all
the scheme, lightens the ship of all the ballast
and then, vogue la galere ! ce que c'est que
cCtiefemme !'

'But suppose it is not "him?' an impertinent
friend would argue, with more
common sense than grammar  ' suppose it is
some tiresome bore from the country or some
exacting dressmaker, who puts out your day.
The sacrifice of your little " scheme " is not so
charming then, is it ?'

Oh, " suppose and suppose." . . . My dear,
one is a conscious actress, not a puppet. And
besides, even then, you have the satisfaction of
disappointing the people who expect you. That
is always delightful,  with the one drawback
that you don't see it. But it is at least pleasure
enough to give zest to your unpremeditated
hours. Then there is the deeper question.

which torments me for ever. Are not the bore
and the dressmaker a pleasure ? No : I dort
mean "mayn't they be more endurable than one
anticipated ? " I mean something more recondite
 something 'quite horridly blue," as poor
Ethelinda Grenvers says. I mean, Are not
'being bored'' and "beingtortured"pfea57i7e5f
are not vexations and disappointments
pleasures ? And not only because of one's
sense of martyrdom, but just simply because
they call on one's nerves in an unexpected
way. Are not grief and pain pleasures ?  it
is just a system of nomenclature  would not
one far sooner lose one's palate for sweets and
one's taste for pretty things than lose great
griefs, great loves, great agonies out of one's
life ? The proof ?  the proof is this : the things
we seek, the things after which we greatly strive,
are they not more akin to loss and death than
to amusement? With all my fondness for bonbons
and theatres, I have got more pleasure out
of a passionate and unrequited love or a cold
midnight vigil by a sick friend  consciously
tasted more nervous satisfaction  than out of

the finest play ever written or the divinest
dishes ever seasoned  d propos of which these
chocolate are something new, bitter not sweet,
you will like them.'

Had Mrs Lupton held forth in this strain to
Waldine de Stair, the girl, full to the brim of a
joy which was mere delight, would have replied,
But you would not call giving pain a pleasure?
surely this pleasure is only a poor spurious sort
of pleasure maugre the pain it gives ? '

Whereto finally Mrs. Lupton would have
replied, 'My dear Yal, one talks lightly and
glibly about giving pain and giving pleasure
what does one know? What does one
predicate ? it is all a habit of speech. One can
only accept intentions. A man gives me a
dog for a plaything : I hate pet dogs, and this
one bites me. But if I could nurse the same
man through an illness I should experience
great pleasure. I may be odd in expressing
myself so frankly. If I were to say I would
rather have opportunities of doing good thana
kingdom, you would approve me, though you
might think me a prig. But when I say I had

far rather a friend of mine had a fever than
that he should give me a lap-dog, you look as
if I blasphemed. But it is all one :  I have
seen pious women rejoice over what they calla
reclaimed sheep, and I have seen them weep
over an unregenerate death-bed ; and I know
perfectly well that the death-bed has been the
more real pleasure. Small blame to them ; it
excites one more.'

And thus, after reducing all pleasure to excitement
and eliminating all tenderness from life,
Mrs. Lupton would plume herself on being the
one woman in London who had the courage of her
opinions. She was, moreover, at this juncture,
the one woman in London whose companionship
was likely to be poison to Waldine de Stair.

For companions they became, although
Waldine, partly from Mrs. Lupton 's effusiveness,
never had any inclination to make a
confidante of her with respect to John Lyne.
It was not fear of her hostess that prevented
her, so much as reverence for her own deep
feeling which she did not now confide to her
most intimate correspondent in Brussels.

Moreover the days were full. Although
every one they met expressed surprise at seeing
Mrs. Lupton, the number of surprised people
was so considerable that it was obvious they
were not quite unfashionable in their locale.
They breakfasted late, and from twelve to two
they drove hither and thither to shops and
picture-galleries  the latter being the usual
trysting-place for some one or other of Mrs.
Lup ton's artistic swains. To Waldine, with
her keen love of colour, it was an infant, after
an hour of tedious shopping, to sit quietly in
Whistler's brown and yellow gallery and listen
to the soft undercurrent of criticism, not unmixed
with scandal, upon which Mrs. Lupton
loved to set her fancies afloat. Then after
luncheon in Curzon Street or, with other birds
of passage, at hotels or great houses half shut
up, where some cosy nook had been brightened
for the hostess in her flying visit, they would
drive out again to studios or teas less formal
than the season's, where there was whatever
music might be available of the best. Then
there were dinners, not too late for the theatres

to which they never went alone ; and occasionally
evenings when they dined out or had friends
with them, generally all going on together to
some large party, artistic and musical, which
would bring them well into the following
morning.

A year before, the girl would have enjoyed
the varied monotony of this pleasant London
life with avidity; but now it seemed to her
not to be stirring, at all, or anything more than
faintly amusing. She had been so deeply
moved that for some weeks she would be able
to take part in the pageant of this existence
without its impressing or fatiguing her in the
least. And this listlessness gave her beauty a
strange charm in contrast to Mrs. Lupton's
brightness and insouciance of quite a different
order. Val's listlessness was not impertinence
like Mrs. Lupton's  it was merely a phase
of preoccupation. In the cold nervous weather
her clear warm pallor and shining serious eyes
were provokingly attractive. And she was
never sad enough to be dull. The wine of
life which those first kisses had poured into

her veins, intoxicated her still. She was seldom
at a loss for an answer, though she was very
often inattentive. If the thought of John
became too much for silence, she wrote to him.

One evening, when they had been dining at
the Bachelors' Club and were just crossing the
long landing before descending to their carriage,
they encountered Mr. Launcelot Denham :
one of the two young men who were their
hosts and who were going on with them to
the French plays, was a cousin of his, and it
was his familiar greeting on the stairs which
made Waldine turn those serious eyes of hers
in Mr. Denham's direction.

Oh Launce ! ' said Mrs. Lupton, who was
never surprised, 'are you a "bachelor"? Look,
I have put my hook into your cousin's nose :
you must come with us and protect him.'

Come where ? ' said the Hon. Launcelot,
stifling an unholy aspiration for Opera Bouche.

To the French plays. I'm sure you'll like
them,  they're very improper.'

But I shan't understand them, and I
haven't got a stall.'

I will explain them as far as my comprehension
serves, and you can draw on your
imagination for the rest. You can get a place
at the theatre and come and sit with us. If
you have your hansom you can take Lord
Lexford ; we had much rather be three in the
brougham than four, and you can have your
talk out there. Lex, dear, your room is really
better than your company on that small back
seat,  Helbert's legs are shorter.'

Mr. Denham, not yet wholly freed from that
heathenish hankering after comic songs and
dances, glanced at Waldine de Stair, while Mrs.
Lupton glibly arranged his transit.

Yes ! ' she said with a little smile,  come
with us. Monsieur de 1 argent : you are so fond
of French, I remember.'

She was glad to see him : he was fresh
from Netherfield, and on the big light staircase
of the club he seemed to summon up a
country breeze  his bright hair, as he stood
before her with uncovered head, reminded her
of the autumn leaves at Whiteknyghts. She
felt to breathe the influences native to John

Lyne, beholding Launcelot Denham. ' Yes,
come with us she said, and, as if the persuasion
in her tone were not enough, she
smiled. Who can blame him that he read the
augury of her smile as kind ?

The French comedies proved rather dull,
but Mrs. Lupton's box was deep enough for
the party to converse unheard, and the Hon.
Launcelot ceased altogether to regret puns
and dances when his hostess bade him return
with them to Curzon Street for some supper
before he went back to his room in St. James'.
It was not often that Mrs. Lupton put herself
out so far as to offer supper even to her
'second selves,' but when she did it was of
the best, and a thing to be remembered.

It was during the evening only that she
bethought her of the invitation, but she managed
to scribble a line to her housekeeper, and
2fet it entrusted to a commissionaire. The
result was that when the brougham and hansom
reached Mayfair a charming little banquet
was prepared in the small front room where
she dined, out of the season. It was a luxurious

honbonniere of an apartment, fitted with plush
couches and hangings of a shade half copper
and half crimson  a kind of Indian red which
was equally becoming to her own pertness and
Waldine's beauty. There was a small round
table, lit by an elaborate hanging-lamp of
bronze and brass  from Mrs. Lupton's own
design (filtered out of Mr. Collington's pencil) 
the light from which, tempered by festoons of
brick dust silk, fell upon dishes of aspic and fruit
and the silver covers of hot soup and cutlets.
There were no flowers on the table, but a large
blue bowl of Christmas roses was, with a few
screens of peacocks' feathers, the only adornment
of the broad chimney-piece, which, like
the rest of the furniture, was of white wood.

There was nothing vulgar in the aspect
of the little supper gleaming on the white
damask. Perfect of its kind, it was at the
same time absolutely unpretentious. It
looked like something to eat, not like something
to stare at or to smell. And the white
walls, the deep-toned hangings, the shaded
but untainted lights, as well as the delicate

fare, were admirable adjuncts to Mrs. Lupton's
prismatic toilette and Waldine's simple dress
of ivory silk. The two young lordlings 
Lexford and Helbert felt themselves in favour,
while Denham was quite solemnised with
happiness. The sight of the piled-up mantles
on the sofa  Mrs. Lupton's furs and satisfied
velvet cloak, and Waldine's white wrappings
and long seal overcoat  filled the young
man's senses with a new strange pleasure. He
thought of Opera Bouffe without a sigh, he
thought of bachelor quarters and regretted
their discomfort. He was not of the order of
modern manhood which busies itself with the
decoration of its chambers.

'Your silence is quite tomh-y, Launce,'
said Mrs. Lupton as she unwound her fair
cropped head from its last lace scarf :  ' You
are a skeleton at my little feast  fleshy, but
still, to the philosophic eye, a skeleton.'

'Oh no r said the Hon. Launcelot rather
pointless, and the blank stupidity of his
answer told Mrs. Lupton something of what
was in his heart. She followed the direction

of his eyes, which rested upon Waldine's form
as she too put off the endless yards of lace
with which her cream - white throat was
swathed.

This is nicer than the theatre she said ina
soft full voice, as she came up to the fire.
The cold night had paled her face, but her
arms were like warm satin, from the protection
of the seal skin coat. They were so
beautiful and so expressive of her youth and
sex that Mr. Denham's face flushed as she
unloved them : he was very susceptible.

Do you never wear bracelets V he said.

Never,' said Waldine. * I hate trinkets, I
look at jewellers' shops and wonder who can
buy those cases full of rubbish in the windows.
If I had Mrs. Lupton's diamonds I might
wear them  'pas autremenV

The Hon. Launcelot, who had in his breast-pocket
one of the said morocco cases, the
contents of which he had taken half the afternoon
to select at Street's for one of the
young ladies who nightly murdered her part
in the Opera Bouffe, was rather astonished at

this new departure. His notion had been
that all girls liked bangles and brooches.

You are so different to every one else,' he
said reflectively ; and though the remark was
ambiguous, the tone conveyed a compliment.

I am odd said Waldine, sitting down ina
chair of gilt carved wood with ornaments
and arms of the ruby plush :  ' Give me one
of those peacock screens : I don't want to be
ugly as well.'

She was so wholly careless of his feelings
that she did not in the least mind what opportunities
for pretty speeches she gave him, and
his feeling for her was too honest and too shy
for him to take full advantage of them. He
gave her the screen, with which she fanned
herself slowly. One little curl on her left
temple waved to and fro with the air it made :
he felt as if his senses came and went with
the sway of that little curl.

Make Lord Helbert come and give me his
opinion of my new mantelpiece in the hall,
Lex,' said Mrs. Lupton to Lord Lexford :  ' It
is not often one can secure the verdict of such

a judge before it is too late. And the thing
is only half done, so that if he suggests anything
I can introduce it.'

Tell me about Netherfield,' said Waldine,
when they were alone, still fanning herself
at the same pace, as she leaned back in her
chair.

*Lord Grenvers is awfully ill,' said Mr.
Denham sympathetically, stirring the bright
wood-fire with his foot, where he stood by the
hearth.

'That I know. He is like Mother Hubbard's
dog ! '

Her ladyship sees nobody except  but that
is scandal ! '

'What is scandal? my aunt is above all
scandal.'

Of course she is really : only I'm so jealous
because she won't see me, you know.'

"Whom does she see ?'

'Only that lucky fellow Lyne. The way
they spoil him is absurd.'

(No answer, and the pace of the waved
fan unchanged.) 

VOL. II. 21

'They treat him more like a son than a
bailiff: he is always with his lordship, and
she gives him tea in her boudoir. He's been
ill or something ' 

(The fan stops waving, but Val does not
speak : surely, where the want of the heart to
hear something is so intense, there can be no
need of questions.) 

'Got cold after Mrs. Lupton's tableaux,
walking home or some folly. And then pleurisy
but he's all right again now.'

(The fan begins waving afresh, more
slowly but in little nervous jerks.) 

Bad thing, pleurisy.'

'Is it?'

Father : carried off my poor mother 
awful loss to a chap that is, Miss de Stair.'

Waldine put down the fan. The expression
of her face was singularly wistful and gentle :
one would almost imagine tears behind the
long, dark lashes. Evidently, thought her devoted
swain, she is not quite indifferent to
what grieves or moves me.

He proceeded to improve the occasion.

Yes : I always feel that there's nothing to
make up for it at home now. There's only
one sort of thing that can console a fellow,
you know ' he hesitated.

'And that is?' said Waldine absently.

Supper said Mrs. Lupton, at this instant,
reappearing with Lords Lexford and Helbert.

AT WHITEKNYGHTS

Among the many surprises familiar to our
capricious England is that of an April day in
the latter half of December. Often after
three stern white frosts it breathes in dawn
over the land, half promise and half regret.
Do not forget me says past summer, looking
back ; ' I am coming,' says spring, looking
forward : it is like the kiss of both. Just
such a morning befell the country within a
week of Christmas, and became Whiteknyghts
bravely. It was as if nature stretched herself,
with thawed limbs, out of her winter sleep.
The breath of the day was like the breathing
of a warm creature over the slushy roads and
cold pools. The grass put off its white mantle

and showed in a great plain of wide untroubled
green where, every now and then, an elfin
shred of the sapless bracken looked like the
ghost of a robin. All sorts of unimagined
plants appeared in view amid relics of departed
autumn. Nature would turn to sleep
again under her whitening coverlet, the little
growing roots and the poor sodden relics
would disappear. This was just a moment of
youth in age, of maturity in innocence ; but
it was a moment irresistible in its charm.
The deed that suggested itself on such a
morning one would do, as it were under the
spell of a dream.

What suggested itself to John Lyne was to
superintend the ordering of part of a plantation,
which, being visible from his usual
sitting-room, was Lord Grenvers' peculiar
care. Fresh shrubs were being planted in
among too scattered trees, while crowded
undergrowth in other places was making way
for unguessed vistas of view. Landscape
gardening was not properly in John's province,
but he knew what Lord Grenvers

wished to see and what he wished to have
hidden, and his taste was as much to be
trusted as his discretion. Moreover there had
been a talk of sacrificing Miss de Stair s ash-tree,
which chanced to be parallel with a fine
oak from one point of observation, and this
ash-tree  which had become the most sacred
of the Whiteknyghts wood in his eyes  he
was resolved to spare. So there he was
among the labourers, on this fantastic winter
day which was as warm as summer, his brown
and white plaid coat thrown open over his
knitted waistcoat and his tan gaiters splashed
with earth and leaves. No companionship
and no costume could have brought out so
strikingly his conspicuous refinement of look.

This was, perhaps, intensified by the severe
illness through which he had passed, of which
Mr. Denham had made cursory mention to
Waldine at Mrs. Lupton's. John's difference
to his compeers was not one of aspect only, it
was unluckily one of constitution also, and on
the burning excitement of the tableaux and
their sequel his long walk homewards through

the icy night had induced a chill which had
attacked his hitherto uncovered lungs. For
some days he had been suffering from a cough,
which seemed to have left him wholly for the
first time to-day under the healing of the
balmy air. This morning he looked renewed
and refreshed, the better  not the worse  for
his illness. And it was pleasant to him to
inhale the rare soft breeze, just flavoured by
the smoke which rose thin and blue from a
smouldering heap of twigs and leaves where
the woodmen had made their fire. It is not
like labour, this easy outdoor work ; it is like
the native play of Adam's sons.

An exquisite laziness stole over John's limbs
at midday, when his subordinates were grouped
about their dinner  half it was the unwonted
weakness of returning health and half the
influences of the quiet day  a laziness careless
and buoyant. He turned from the still scene,
where axe and chopper were hushed for an
hour, and with a smile upon his lips strolled
in the direction of the beloved tree.

His eyes were cast down on the unveiled

land, which he was not, like most of his kind,
too stupid to observe. They rested happily
upon the ferns, the bits of dark brown brier
and the variegated ivy which he was glad to
see again after their white burial. These
grew at either side his way, but his immediate
footprints were on a track which was almost
worn into a path by now. It went  the least
bit out of his way home, be it confessed  to
Waldine's ash-tree, which with its twin stems
was more noticeable than before amid the
general leaflessness of the scene ; soon after,
joining a road which branched two ways  the
right-hand turn leading to John s home, the
left in the direction of Mrs. Lupton's forsaken
halls. Where the path joined the road there
was a stile, and when John Lyne reached this
stile it was just half-past twelve o'clock on
this December day. Netherfield church clock
was striking.

There was no hurry  John's dinner-hour
was one, but he was not tied to it because it
happened that both his parents were away.
They had not gone far, only down to Nether-field

to make their small preparations for the
Christmas season ; but, being both in years,
they would honour appreciative connections
in the town with their presence to dinner,
when the marketing was done, so as to get a
good rest and chat before John drove down to
fetch them at dusk. Thus he was obliged to
keep near home, having the key of the house
in his pocket, but free to choose his own
moment for the frugal meal that awaited him
there. And this moment was not now; the
stile  quite dry in the noonday sun  was too
tempting ; he climbed up and sat down, with
his pensive eyes still on the ash-tree and his
back to the road.

Presently he lit his pipe, and the touch of
his pocket-book to his hand, as he did so,
would have reminded him of Waldine if he
had ever forgotten her for a single instant.
He drew out her last letter and he read these
words from the close of it :

I am getting sorry that I told you not to
write : if I do not hear of you I shall begin to
think you are only a misty phantom of the

meadows : I shall cease to believe you real.
But that is not what I most fear. Indeed I
have no sort of fears that you are not true.
My fear is that I shall become unreal myself :
my fear is that I shall forget you.  In that case
what would become of me, what should I do T

He did not understand the cry of the heart
which spoke in those words. The effort
against evaporation under many-sided pressure
was an effort of which he had no experience.
For him to forget was impossible. He loved
deeply : he had striven against his love until
he had the certainty that it was an accepted
thing ; then he became one with it, the flame
of it the flame of his life. He was hers, she
was his. The first was easy, the second
difficult; but both were truths. 'Forget?'
he did not understand.

He sat and pondered, still as some woodland
creature in the crystal morning. With his russet
clothes, the rooks might have taken him for part
of the landscape, but for the little waft of smoke
from his pipe at steady intervals ; their sentinel
sat on a bough and watched him ; perhaps the

bird would have understood light love better.
To meet, to pair, to part. No; John would
never come to think that this was love.
Waldine's letters were marvels to him, sacred
marvels which were his dearest possession.
There was nothing that she said, in her fluent,
exuberant moods, which his heart did not echo
steadfastly ; he had got used to let her flute -
stops express the song of his heart, and the
piping which was her satisfaction taught his
love a tune ; but in this last movement of the
music he had no skill to join. *My fear is
that I shall become unreal myself.' Here was
perplexity indeed. What was the world doing %
he did not know.

So silent he was that a traveller might have
passed him by, and so absorbed in thought that
he did not hear a footstep which came softly
brushing through the hedgerow grass. Nearer
and nearer it came, light as the step of a girl who
nears her heart's desire. And when it stopped
close by him  suddenly and short  it was no
more than if the air drops, less than if a leaf
rustles.

Are you not real, Waldine che Stair ? ' he
said aloud in his grave and tender tone.

I am quite real, John.Lyne, and I am here,'
said an answering voice behind him.

It was she indeed ; her shadow almost fell
upon the letter in his hand. In a second he
had turned and faced her with that sort of
light in his whole look that mountains catch
at sunrise. She was standing on the grassy
edge of the road, half shy, half bold, an incarnation
of beauty and love. Her lips and eyes
were like jewels in the softness of her fair and
wind-fanned face.

Why don't you speak to me ?' she said at
last, laughing softly for joy.

For although he said no word to her as yet,
there was no doubt of his welcome. . . . How
kind and liberal was this winter day ! were
there ever any two hearts so utterly and unreservedly
and happily alone ?

The stile was still between them. ' Don't
come across to me,' she said in breathless gasps,
I want to see you there : it is too good to be
true ! Listen, John. I have come all this

way to find you : I must tell you at once before
I am afraid of you, while I still feel as if
it were only the king of dreams that I speak
to. I could not do without you any longer.
No one knows I am come. . . . Oh ! do not
look at me. . I am ashamed, I don't
know why'  and breaking off from speech,
she suddenly wheeled round and buried her
face in her fur muff.

John stood quite still : his heart beat in
his chest like a sledge hammer : it was with
difficulty that he found words, when he did
they came slowly and low : ' Oh,' he said,.
you are not dead ? you are my own sweet
love ? . . . and welcome.'

With his utterance a sort of trembling
seemed to shake her : in a second he had strode
across the stile, and his warm arms were round
her. But her courage was gone. She hid
her burning face upon his shoulder, and a
quick string of nervous speech escaped her
lips.

I cannot tell you what it was  Mrs. Lufton
went on a journey  I was alone : I had

driven with her to the station in a cab, it was
too early for the carriage. . I told the footman
something  I don't know what  because
I saw there was a train just starting  I took a
ticket  I got in  I walked from the station.'

Have you done right, have you run any
risks ? '

I did not like to come on to Netherfield,
I got out at Mrs. Lupton's station : no one
knew me. I walked . it did not seem
far . . . and then I saw you.'

Thank God. What if you had not seen
me?'

/ should have died  / shoidd have gone
on and seen my aunt

The instantaneous contradiction was so
artless that they both laughed  that double
ripple of laughter, deep with sweet, than which
there is no better music.

Do not laugh, John  listen ! think what
I have done. I have found you and I have
two hours. Have you two hours which you
will give me for mine ?'

*I have better than that: I have all my life.'

Soil ! but just now it is these two hours
that I want. John, have you a well-regulated
mind V

Not just now.'

 No, but presently ; because I will tell you
a secret, " I am tired :" that sounds all right ;
but the rest sounds horrible, " I am hungry."
I thought when I had found you I should not
feel hungry, but I do. Is food possible V

'Listen to me now!'  He spoke as one
speaks to a child, but his voice quivered : 
'I am all alone at home to-day. Only two
hundred yards away from here there is a house
and a fire and food . . . and a welcome. But
you will go on to the Court.'

Do you think so ? Oh ! my king of
dreams, before you grow too dreadfully real,
let me tell you that a fireless barn with your
welcome and a crust of bread  only just now
I'm very particular about that crust of bread 
is better to me than all the Courts in Europe.
And no, John, no ! I am not going to be sent
on to my people. If you are alone like this,
it is Providence, and we " must not fly in the

face of" Aunt Ethelinda's favourite Providence.
For these two hours let us forget the world.'

With all my heart said John Lyne, ' your
world we will forget, but you are all my world.'

'Very well  that is understood. Now
listen to me,'  she pushed him from her a little,
and looked at him with her glowing eyes, 
Answer me quick and straight : do you love
me V

You only, you ever ; so help me God,'
said John.

I wanted to hear you say it : I am sure of
you now. Say " yes " three times.'

Yes  yes  yes.'

The first " yes " is this : you will never
breathe my coming. The second "yes" is
this : you are mine for these two hours. The
third " yes " is this : when 1 am gone you will
forget that I have been here  forget it wholly
and for ever.'

Why don't you command me things that
matter for always. Why so set on now f '

Because it is now that matters for always.
People are so full of long promises and great

hopes. I hate them both. I want and I claim
to-day  to-day and you.'

They are both yours, my darling. . . .'
Then silence, just because no word was

sweet enough for speech. . . .

After a moment  * Then, John,' she said,
I will tell you what I will do with my gifts.
I will use the one for the other : let me
help you in your daily life. Tell me things
to do.'

To-day is holiday : if you will please me
you will come and dine : home is close by.'

I am not tired. This moment I thought
I was, but now, '' my heart is full of rest." '

She did not look tired : she looked like some
radiant creation of sunbeams in the vigour and
freshness of her lovely youth. And the sunbeams
seemed spilt also over her shining furs.

Her broken sentences had told John all
he needed to know : more plainly the facts
were these : Mrs. Lupton had been for sometime
in treaty for a villa on the seacoast,
the purchase of which was just completed.
Unkind rumour  which she made a point of

VOL. II. 22

encouraging  affirmed that her frequent visits
to it were not made alone. On this particular
day she was due there to arrange some final
preliminaries as to its alteration and  to tell
for her, first, what she would not have concealed
she was going to install Mr. Collington thereto
superintend the decorations of the drawing-room.
There was no need to take Waldine.
If her trip shocked the girl, so much the better :
it would be a pity if she discovered that the
talk was wholly of " apple greens " and
French grays "  Mrs. Lupton would lose the
"prestige of her flirtations : she made a little
mystery of the journey to Yal.

'You shall come and see me ofi" at the
station, and meet me in the evening. I have
ordered the carriage at seven ;' she had said.
Amuse yourself well and lunch where you
will.'

As her train steamed out ol the station
Waldine had recognised the platform as that
of the Netherfield line. It was early, little
past nine o'clock, and she chanced to remember
the time-table. There was an express just

starting wliicli would bring her to Netherfield
in less than three hours. To tell the young
footman that she would not want him  that
she had to meet a friend with whom she
would spend the day  was the work of a
moment. In three minutes she had got her
ticket, and in a minute more had found an
untroubled solitude in a railway carriage.
The 3.15 train back would land her at the
station in town by half past six, so that, as
Mrs. Lupton's train was not timed to arrive
till 7.5, she could await her hostess in the
brougham. Waldine's impulsiveness and
innocence together compounded for her a
strange independence which was one of her
most dangerous and fascinating traits. The
glow of it kept her from any conscience-chills in
her extraordinary proceeding, while it quickened
her inventive faculties : she determined
to get out at the little station which Mrs.
Lupton used, where she would be taken for
one of that lady's many erratic visitors, who
came and went pretty much as they liked
during her own absence. At Netherfield

University OlF

AVhiteknyghts was all ; but county boundaries
are strongly marked, and at the next station,
only three miles off, Whiteknyghts was nothing.

The bright soft air of the exhilarating day
was like a tonic to the girl's nerves, and it
was not till she came close to John Lyne's
house that she felt her heart sink ; there then
commenced in her spirits a reaction which
would have overwhelmed her, and very likely
sent her on to her aunt with some excuse of
home-sickness, had she not come upon the
object of her quest and heard his spoken
words. To answer them aloud was irresistible,
and she found herself launched once
more upon the tide of passion whereon she
floated thus serenely.

They walked on down the lane, which was
so hedged with evergreen and fir that it wore
a summer aspect quite in harmony with the
day's ; and away to their right AValdine remarked
the thin blue smoke which rose from
the woodmen's noontide fire. There was
something strangely pleasant to the lovers in
this sign of life so near them and yet so

remote ; it was a sort of suggestion how fickle
was the tenure of these stolen moments, which
trebled their sweetness. But they were quite
secure ; not until much later in the day would
some market-woman pass up this road, and
probably the wheels of John's cart when he
went to fetch his parents would be the first
sound upon the sylvan silence. Two hours of
solitude, mutual and undisturbed, were to
be their portion.

My scheme is this,' said Waldine, as they
approached the little house, which, despite
all her plans, she had never visited :  ' We will
play at being old friends : suppose now, John,
that you have been at work all the morning, and
I have been at home preparing your dinner.'

Then we shall have to suppose you have
prepared a very poor one.'

Never mind that. 'better is a dinner
of herbs

" Where love is," ' added John, emphasising
the quotation by taking her hand 

" Than a stalled ox and hatred withal," '
she concluded briskly, withdrawing it.

He took his latchkey from his pocket, and
Waldine laughed at it because it was so
clumsy and old-fashioned  such a contrast to
the London latchkey which Mrs. Lupton aired
so daintily and was for ever leaving at home.
As they passed together up the garden-path,
she took it from him that she might unlock
the door herself.

Welcome home,' said John, as they stood
together on the threshold. There was a late
rose growing under the shelter of the porch ;
he had watched it for some days ; he stooped
and picked it now.

AT HOME

There is nothing mean in the configuration
of John Lyne's abode. It has a certain
old-fashioned simplicity which lets it hold its
own even in comparison with Mrs. Lupton's
gilded halls. Here all is Spartan, but the
severity is symmetrical and the effect of it
refined. Ugly things there are  the gauze protected
looking-glass, the antimacassar-shrouded
chairs, the beadwork mats  but they have a
trivial air ; they do not greatly offend because
they are palpably ephemeral  a touch would
sweep them away : what is permanent is the
fine old crust of the quaint house ; the sun
that lights it, the breeze that airs it, these
endure and recur  a quarter of an hour would

rid the rooms of all traces of a past hundred
years, another quarter of an hour would
reinstate them wholly. The simple, solid
house, where generations have been born,
have led their honest lives and died, it is
never without dignity ; in this case it is not
entirely without beauty. And Waldine has
of late been too spoiled to be critical ; the
mood of her journey is protest  reaction ; if
her lover lived in a cottage she would be
satisfied and glad. The character of the
house being, to a certain extent, the character
of its inmates, one is led to conjecture, not
amiss, that looking-glasses, antimacassars, and
beadwork mats have been presents  tributes
of respect to John Lyne's mother and grandmother
 when one sees the meal that is ready
for his return. It is plain, homely fare, but it
is set out with a neatness which makes it
appetising. There is cold meat and ham ;
there is some vegetable soup in a pot over
the fire, and there is cold plum-pudding, for
which Waldine has a schoolgirl's passion.
The butter and the bread are perfect, being

indeed the same that are supplied to White-knights
; and there is home-made wine in a
carved corner-cupboard underneath the clock,
which seems to tick out loudly, ' Look up, lookup,'
as if insisting that no moment of the
precious hours should be lost.

Her survey of the parlour has resulted in
Waldine's opening John's little piano which
occupies the place of honour there and has
attracted her attention ; but it is with the
larger room  half dining-hall, half kitchen 
that she is most enchanted. In the gay light,
which it is impossible to believe the same that
struggles through the murk of a London fog,
each old bit of furniture seems to laugh and
shine  the place to its farthest crevice seems
aware of the lovely and unwonted presence
for which it must put on its finest smile.
The seal-skin of the girl's Parisian coat is not
more glossy than the old oak settle upon
which she throws it, the satin lining of her
muff is dull beneath the brightness of the old
brass warming-pan above it. But her beauty
holds its own, it pales the sunlight and the

fire. She flits hither and thither like a foreign
bird ill a barn, and wherever she rests for a
moment, the eye recalls her grace. She is
perfume, laughter, music, warmth, delight 
love. John Lyne has hung up his cap in the
hall, and he stands  dazed with pleasure 
watching her explore his ancient home. He
forgets that it is himself whom she has come
to see ; he is unconscious of the possessive
charm of his own presence ; it seems to him
as if she were come to be a glory on each old
familiar thing, which shall be no more as it
was when her sojourn is over. But to be
indoors sets off his stature and his face, and
there is no discrepancy in his dress with the
apparatus of his simple home. Even his tan
boots are in keeping on the stone floor, and
there is nothing that the sunshine touches to
such beauty as his curly hair. The genius of
the place, it is he that really satisfies the girl's
 heart with this unknown, unequalled thrill of
soft content. It is he that is the prize of her
seeking.

Half wilful and half shy, she does not look

at him now ; and he is so chivalrous, so
reverent, that he lets her take her own way,
neither by speech nor glance embarrassing her
or making her feel that there is any danger or
scandal in her scheme. He lends himself to
her charming will with his easy, loyal nature.
He neither helps nor hinders her actions ; his
attitude says plainly, 'AH that I have and all that
I am are yours.' The treatment of her chattels,
that is for her to decide, who is the lady of
his homestead and the mistress of his life.

Her decision is favourable to both. She is
bent upon beneficence  and luncheon ! She
throws two sheep-skin mats beneath the little
table where the board is partly spread ; she
signs to John to draw up two arm-chairs,
instead of the straight, high-backed pair which
are set for Mr. and Mrs. Lyne in their places
against the wall. In an instant she has given
a touch of luxury and ease to the little
banquet. And this, too, she will serve in her
own way. * We must garnish our soup,' she
says laughing, and flings open the corner
cupboard where Mrs. Lyne's sauces are ranged.

Chili vinegar ! Join, it is what his lordship
always takes in soup ; get it out. How
I wish I could cook ! But I can make a
salad  and she sets to work with some fresh
vegetables.

She has turned up her neat sleeves over
the rounded wrists ; and John Lyne marks, as
Launcelot Denham marked in London, the
beauty of her girlish arms. But he does not
contemplate them as Mr. Denham took leave
to do. Her beauty will recur to him when
this sunny day is done, haunting his senses
like a fever. The oval shape of her slim waist,
the firmness of her graceful shoulders to
which the plain gown clings so lovingly,
they will have due place in the recollected
image that will fill his dreams ; but not to
take her in his arms, not to tell her what is in
his heart  that is the effort now. When she
stoops close to him, and, raising up her head,
lets the fragrance of her hair reach him ; A\'hen
she touches him lightly in passing, when her
laughter fans towards him the pure warmth of
her breath  at every moment of contact, at all

proximity  there is built within his brain, ever
deeper and ever dearer, the face and figure of
his idol. His passion, restrained though he
keeps it, is like a cumulative poison which
makes gradual headway in his veins because
of her exceeding loveliness and charm. He
is glad with a great joy that is like the
revelation of bliss undreamed and unimagined
pleasure. He is in fairyland ; the caprice
of his fancy is realised beyond its utmost
conception.

To the caprice of her fancy there is no limit
but that of time and space ; she has no such 
bounded routine as has been his, to circumscribe
her horizon. His eight and twenty
years of sameness find no parallel in her nineteen,
so lightly lived amid various changes of
scene and company. To sit in twilight and
become suddenly possessed of the sun, that
would be a surprise ; but to find one's self an
inhabitant of the sun after a series of short
stays on planets at will, would be little more
than a halting-stage in a journey.

I am famished ! come and eat.'

They seat themselves and taste their mutual
meal. Waldine is honestly hungry, and though
she has but the appetite of a healthy bird, she
makes a feint at least of eating her luncheon.
John cannot eat. There is a sort of hurry in
his nature which will not let him feed it.
Unpractised nerves of sense are at their utmost
tension, the demands of usual fibres are
forgotten. She does not notice his abstinence.
Her delicate organisation recruits itself quickly ;
the soup and meat which she tastes, sitting at
rest in the warm bright room, strengthen her
to banish fatigue and shyness. She is at
home ; she feels as if she lived in that room
and ate at that table always. The strangeness
that abides is his, in his own house, not
hers.

To me this is the happy life,' she says,
with that perception of her pleasure while she
enjoys it which is so rare and which doubles
the value of existence. 'I don't know how
you live or what you do, but I feel as if I
knew it all. You will have to see after those
woodmen, ami John, and I shall prepare your

tea ; and then we shall play and sing all
through the winter evening, shutting out the
tiresome world with those good strong shutters ;
is not that so ? Ah no ! I shall be dining in
London and you will be walking through the
dark to Whiteknyghts. I think I am jealous
of some one who is at Whiteknyghts.'

'There was some one there that I love,'
says John, humouring her with a smile, ' but
she went away to London and forgot me.'

'For a time.' Her eyes look very long
and tender in the clear afternoon light ; she
sits facing it with the frank carelessness of
her beauty. ' No ; I am not jealous of that
girl, John, I think I am jealous of my aunt.'

They both laugh.

By the way, tell me what she says to
you.'

Never a word about you. When I came
back with the doctor for his lordship you were
gone with Mrs. Lupton. Each morning I
have met the postman ; but I supposed that
you could not do that in London, so I hesitated
before writing, and then you forbade me.'

I know ; I hate complications, and I don't
care for letters. I like to write them.'

Since then I have had a sort of fever, and
she has been very kind.'

You must not have fevers ; I hate illnesses ;
and you must not let her be kind. You are
well again now, are you not ? '

Never better  never half so well.'

But thinner. I did not see it in your
thicker coat at first. Ami John, do you know
that you are very good to look at.'

So that you are here to see me, I am glad.'

Eat and drink. I want to do you good.
I heard of your illness ; if I had been nice I
should have told you that it was the news
of it which brought me. But it was not. I
wanted to see you, to make sure that you
existed. And if I had found you ill, I should
have been angry. Sono facta cost

He smiles again, disbelieving her though
she is speaking the absolute truth.

' And now we will make plans. I do not
want to stay away any longer. No ; I am not
really jealous of her ladyship ; I do not care.

But I care to see you. I mean to return and
you are to do all that I choose.'

A shadow passes over his face as he listens.
May I speak first V he says decisively.

'If you mean, "may you speak to her
ladyship first,"  no. Certainly not. If you
mean, " may you say something to me now,"
proceed.'

He had meant the former: she has incidentally
denied him his request, and it is difficult
for him to repeat it in view of her leave that
he shall say what he wills to her. He leans
across the table, looking very sombre and
earnest ; she gazes straight out of the window,
only her lips twitch a little and her colour
comes and goes.

'Waldine,' he says gravely, 'you mean
well by me, do you not ? '

*I don't know what you call well  I love
you.'

'That is enough. I will tell you what
love means to me. It means all.'

She makes a little comprehensive gesture
with her hands, part mocking and part nervous,
VOL. II. 23

He goes on steadily. ' That you should
love me in the sense I mean, is so immense
a thing that I want you to understand it.'

I do not want to understand it : (hest plus
fort que moi.'

There is a shortness in her answer which
tells him plainly that she has envisaged the
subject and put it by.

'Think of it in all its bearings,' he says,
after a pause, ' think what you give up.'

I give up nothing,' she says quickly, ' I
keep all I have and I take you.'

But is that possible ? '

" Is it possible ? " ami John, is it not the
case ? I am here with you : what do I lose? 
a dull luncheon in London. And yes ! I know
something of what you would say, and I ask
you, de grace, not to say it. I think it would
spoil my day. You tell me love means all to
you. I tell you it means all to me. Is not
that enough ? What does it matter if the two
alls " are not exactly the same ? '  and John
cannot forbear a smile at her logic, while he
has not the heart to contradict her conclusion.

Therefore,' she proceeds with the air of
one who has disposed of a parenthesis, ' my
plan is this : we will win Lord Grenvers and
my aunt by gradual means. They are devoted
to you, and they are too unused to me to mind
greatly what I do. We will be nice to them,
ami John, and they will come round to our
point of view. Meanwhile I dream of a second
life all the time  a life together, yours and
mine  like the birds' life in the fields : this is
its commencement, there is nothing to hinder
its continuing.'

Still John is silent ; she is so plausible, so
sure, that he is half ashamed of the warnings
of his conscience.

Ah ! do not look at me so critically, one
would think I were proposing a crime'  she
too leans forward now, and speaks quickly
and below her breath. 'Ever since I have
been here this has been my dream  a life of
friendship with you which should be the song
of which my other life, with all its music,
should be nothing more than an accompaniment.
I think approval would spoil this a

little : I want to keep my happiness hidden
from all the world. Do you not understand ?
I want to wake in the morning and think that
a mile of woodland lane will bring me to you,
that a special hour in the day will be your
hour with me. I want contrast in my life :
almost I fancy Mrs. Lupton has taught me this
want. I should 'prefer to live tiresome days
at the Court and know that there would be a
moment of this home-feeling in each  greatly
prefer that to living simply here. Don't look
so sad, John. It is not that I do not like
you,'  she pauses, and the tears flood her
lovely eyes,  ' it is because I like you so well.
That is the fashion of my soul,'  in an instant
the tears have given place to a light smile, 
the dress I like best, John, the food I prefer,
1 do not want to wear and eat the same always.
I should go on liking them, do not be afraid ;
but the delight of expectation and of remembrance,
these would be gone.'

 And your love would be less without
these.'

I do not say that : I do not know how

great it is or how much greater it may become.
But I want to foster it in my own way, and
you must spoil me so far. Has my plan no
charm for you ? '

Yes : it has charm.'

Great changes may occur : how do we
know what may happen ? The chances of the
world and life may bring us gradually nearer
without our making efforts. And an effort
might part us beyond our own recall  think
of that, John.'

Yes, I am afraid that is true.'

Well, then, it is wisest as well as best that
we should trust each other ? '

That little turn of her voice as she questions
him:  it is more than he can bear. He rises
abruptly and walks to the window. What is
he to do ? Is he to warn her of a danger of
which she never seems to dream ? Is it not
more manly, as her host, and more true, as her
lover, for him to accede to her simple plan 
putting his life in her hands, and see that no
harm befalls her in the scheme she proposes 
than to urge her to a final step at once of which

she might repent too late. With himself her
guardian, she can always find safety against him.
She leans back in her chair, radiant, contented,
happy. She watches him with a
luxurious sense of pleasure : she has no sort of
notion of the ferment in his brain. She waits
for him to speak without the slightest apprehension
; and though he does not look at her,
he is aware of that sunshiny calm in her heart
which her eyes express.

Waldine,' he says at last  for the taste of
her name is very sweet to his mouth  ' I am
older than you are.'

 Ten years I think,' in the slow untroubled
voice with which a nymph might murmur
singing and swinging on a wave.

And what I ought to say to you is this :
'* Go from me altogether." '

But that you will not say,' she answers
in the same tone, with no trace of surprise.

But that I cannot say,' he repeats in a low,
hoarse voice  the trouble is all his,  sand
therefore I say this : do with me what you
will, there is nothing in my life but you. I

will be satisfied if I am something at least in
yours.'

Something, John ? are you not all ? 

I think that you think so. Love, I have
no more doubt of you than I have of the light,
but I have a longing that all you have and are
should be the best. Realise what it is that
you hold out to me  all that my heart most
seeks  companionship, understanding, beauty.
And then by and by, if you blame me for
grasping at these, try at least to forgive me.'

'Your voice sounds sad, John, let me see
your face.'

He does not turn towards her yet. ' And
in return,' he goes on in the same low voice,
but firmly, with a vibration in his tone that
thrills her as she listens  * in return for my life
make me one promise. While you meet me,
while you accept my . . . friendship, you will
love but me. You say, and truly, there
come times of change. If change takes hold
of your heart, tell me, and I will put the world
between us and leave you free. I would bear
it if you told me honestly that your love had

died : I would bear it though it broke my heart.
But one thing I could not and I would not
bear  to share you with another. I come of
an old country stock, and we have all of us had
notions of honour which would seem strained
to you. I do not want you to enter into
them, but I want you to know them. Where
we are loved we are faithful to death ; where
we are deceived we kill. It was so once and
it will be so again. We kill or we die  at any
rate there is an end. That is the only stigma
on my family,' he adds, lifting his head more
erect as he names it :  ' I have heard it spoken
of with shame, but I am proud of it. . . . You
swill not deceive me.'

I adore you,' says the girl beneath her
breath.

Then he turns his head. The effort it has"
been to him to speak has flushed his face and
straightened his posture. His eyes glow and
his handsome mouth is set into a stern smile.
Waldine has not changed her attitude, but her
cheek has paled a little. She has the look of
one who listens to stirring music  her lips are

parted, her eyes dwell upon his face. She
is not afraid : she is in an ecstasy of love
and admiration : she has found something to
surpass her hopes. They remain for some
seconds without moving.

Then a tall clock in the corner strikes two
beats from its deep heart of oak.

A GOLDEN HOUR

Two o'clock.'

Ah ! we have not another hour ; but I
shall be able to drive you to the station ; we
can do it in twenty minutes

She rises without thanking him : details of
time and distance  those are for him to decide.

Meanwhile they have very nearly an hour
to spend together  how enjoy it best '?

She walks away from the table and contemplates
the room critically ; as she does so
she smiles at the history told by the little
luncheon-table.

Ami John, do you generally use all these
plates and dishes ? '

John shakes his head ruefully : deceptions

have never been in his line. He is at a
loss.

Enjin, we must clear our own table, and
efface my record.'

This domestic concern makes their intercourse
easier. It seems to soften off the edge
of steepness from their conversation. Waldine's
plate and glass are washed by John's own
hands and set, by hers, in a particular corner
where his eye can rest upon them often. He
makes up the fire ; she opens the window.
The beauty of the day is at its height still.

Mild as May,' he says, as the soft air fans
him. He stands between the window and the
fireplace, and watches her throw out some
scraps of bread to the birds.

See, John, there is a robin, and sparrows,
and a blackbird in the distance.'

*And presently the rooks will come, only
they see you. Do you hear the thrush ?

" 'Twas the thrush sang in the woodland  hear

the story, hear the story ! 
And the lark sang 'give us glory,' and the dove

sang ' give us peace.' " '

Surely John's dinner-room has never echoed
any bird's song sweeter than her voice !

'Will you do me a favour?' he says in a
tone that does not anticipate refusal.

Yes.'

Come into the next room and sing to me.
There is my small piano there ; you opened it
but you did not play.'

I was not at home with you then as I
am now Yes, wee will sing something : what
shall it be?'

He opens the door into the passage and she
walks before him into the opposite room.

*When I come to live here I shall make
this room so pretty she says laughing.

It is a new thought for John  another
dream for his Arabian nights of enchantment.

What will you do ? ' he asks her.

I will have only the piano and a little
wicker table and two wicker chairs, with some
Turkish mats, upon those nice oak boards. And
then plants and flowers  oh ! endless flowers.'

But where are the flowers to come from in
December? we have no hot-houses here.'

Qu'importe f Mr. Denham shall bring the
flowers.'

John's face clouds : she feels that he is
grave and turns quickly towards him.

'No!' he says, 'Mr. Denham shall not bring
the flowers ; I will build you a conservatory and
fill it with hyacinths, and we can have lilies and
cyclamens too  our own flowers, not his.'

She listens to his voice which, whenever he
speaks fervently, seems to mesmerise her into
assent,  the spell of his manhood.

Very well,' she says dreamily, and sits
down to the piano.

She plays a 'prelude of Chopin  the sort of
music his little Broadsword has never echoed
before  and then she sings a setting of Vivian's
song from the ' Idylls of the King ' 

In love, if love be love, if love be ours,
Faith and faith can ne'er be equal powers,
Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all'

It is a very simple setting of the words, but
John's heart approves it. He is seated close to
the piano, almost facing her as she sings. . . ,
He loves her ' all in all.'

So you see that you must trust me altogether,'
she says, when she has finished.

It's done,' he answers her decisively:  ' Do
not think I have been pondering about it.
Kemember that it is your life which is complex,
mine is single and plain.'

" Single and plain," like an old maid,' she
says, evading the recurrence of his serious
mood. She leans forward on the keys with
her face resting on her hands, and looking full
into his eyes she laughs. ' John, is it not
strange that our life here does not seem to me
future but present  I had almost said past 1 I
cannot think of it with apprehension. I suppose
I ought to think gravely of its chances,
with a resolve, in event of fate spoiling it, to bean
old maid  if not "plain" " singled But I
don't. I feel to be on level ground, to be able
to look far back and far forward, and there are
no changes and no surprises.'

I think it is your nature,' says John
quietly ; ' you are like a bird ; you will sing ina
cage, if you are there, as well as in a grove.
Sing something else in this cage.'

Her fingers wander over the keys for an
instant : she picks out the cavatina of Raff,
then she stops abruptly. ' How strange it is
that you should be so fond of music !' she says.

Because I have to work ? ' he answers her ;
oh ! it is not unusual now. There is some
sort of musical instrument in almost every
farm-house, and generally it is the men who
play and sing more than their wives and
daughters.'

Which reminds me. Find something that
we shall sing together.'

He stands up and turns over a pile ot.
music on the piano ; as he does so he is very
near her. The piano is low, and his right
hand is almost before her ; she lays her fair
face caressingly upon his arm. He looks
down quickly. Something in her drooping
attitude and shamefaced silence touches him
to infinite tenderness. He restrains his first
impulse lest it should alarm her. She is so
at rest in her trust of him that a kiss would
disturb her. But her beauty is eloquent in its
stillness and seems to demand an answer.

AValdine,' he says, ' may all God's angels
guard you ; you are the joy of my life ! You
have made me so glad to-day, that for any
pain your love may ever bring me, I forgive
you now.'

Somehow that was what I wanted you to
say,' she replies presently, raising her head.
The tears stand again in her beautiful, burning
eyes.

Here are my songs,' says John gently,
but we have not many minutes now, and
your talk is sweeter than my singing.'

But I want to hear your voice. Oh ! here
are Mendelssohn's duets, John ; let us sing
this one ! '

They sing together : 

Oh ! wert thou in the could blast
On yonder lea, on yonder lea,
My plaids to the angry airt
I'd shelter thee. . . .'

It is wonderful how their voices blend, and

how their mood befits the strain.

The desert were a paradise

If thouVert there, if thou wert there. . . .'

they sing.

With something very like a sob she breaks
off suddenly. Her whole being seems melted
into song and love. His steadfast eyes that
watch her as she plays, his pure, true voice
that matches them, his bodily presence which
she has come so far to seek  they are the
light, the sound, the air of her magic world.
She sighs heavily and then gets up from the
piano, pushing her chair away backwards not
to touch him. There are things she could not
bear.

I cannot sing,' she says ; * go and get the
horse, I think it is time to go.'

The want of tenderness in her words does
not make them intended. A complimentary
phrase of departure would reveal less feeling
than this hr usque command. By the same
token he makes no answer : he only looks at
his watch and then goes out of the room.

She is quite still for a few moments, standing
by the window, as her wont is, with her
hands clasped behind her. The first thought
that rouses her is a momentary wonder whether
her famous ash tree is visible from this house ;
VOL. II. 24

but the wonder is too transitory for her to
care to satisfy it by observation. It just acts
in her brain the sort of part a dream is said
to act in sleep  it serves for gradual awakening.
Then she passes her hand over her eyes and
looks back into the room.

To think that he can live here ! ' she says
beneath her breath.

Going away, he has taken more than he
knew. He has, as it were, exposed the
commonness of his joor little drawing-room :
she sees it as it is. Sometimes a flood of sunshine
will make an ordinary object beautiful :
the sun goes in, and its ugliness appals one.
Now that the sunshine of her heart is gone,
this empty place of it looks hideous and
barren. In a sort of reaction from her trivial
surroundings, she glances down on a beautiful
gold pencil that hangs by her side ; her fingers
adjust it and its use occurs to her. There is a
blotting-book on the table in front of her : she
takes a scrap of paper from between its leaves,
and placing it against the window-pane she
writes these words : 

When you play music, close your eyes and
think of me. My home is in your heart.'

With an impulse to give something to him
in remembrance of this golden hour, she
unfastens the pencil-case and rolls it up in the
scrap of paper. Her desire is to leave some
trace behind her which shall be more beautiful
than the details of her lover's daily life ; the
impulse is not entirely unselfish. She walks
back to the piano and lays the little packet on
the keys, closing the case. With that curious
trust in circumstances which with her is half
instinct and half carelessness, she is sure that,
his hands will be the first to find it. Then
she quietly returns to the less decorated room
which pleases her so much better, and puts
on her hat and jacket without going to the
glass.

She has done with the scene of this episode.
That is her feeling. Thoroughly sincere as
she is in her love, she is without that intimate
affection for place and objects which characterises
her sex. The passion that has possessed
her is too concentrated, too large, to let her

trouble much about its accidents. This particular
act of life's drama is over : the stage
on which it has been played is nothing to her
but a platform that has served its turn. As
she slowly draws on her tan gloves she does
not even look about her. She has no wish
for a mental photograph of the house where
her seat is set.

Meanwhile John is mindful of her departure.
A few minutes have sufficed him to
harness the Denham mare and brush the
cushions of his little country cart. He makes
all haste, for he too must find her some token
of his devotion from among his few and
simple worldly goods.

When he comes downstairs from ransacking
his treasures he meets her in the hall.

'Will you take this?' he says, 'the words
are in what always seems to me your native
language.'

He has a quaint old oval case in his hand,
glass, with a gold rim. Long years ago it was
a gift to some forefather of his from the
woman to whose tragic fate he has made

allusion  the Avoman from whom he has
inherited his peculiar beauty. It contains a
tress of dark hair, on which rests a delicate
ivory tablet shaped into a heart ; on the
tablet, in fine black letters, like old-fashioned
penmanship, are the words, ' Ton amitie fait
monroe;' round it and above it a thread of
gold is twined into a true-lover's knot. Intrinsically
of no great value, it is the kind of
token which a sympathetic mind regards with
reverence. It has been the sign, it is still the
memorial, of the heart's desire. To some one,
at some time, it has seemed worth the world
beside.

She takes the present in her hand and
reads the posy in her clear foreign accents.
It is written wrong,' she says,  but it is very
pretty. Ami John, there is something I
want, of which this reminds me. I want a
bit of your hair. Do you think we could
undo this to hold it : the rim is slight ? '

He holds the locket, looking at it critically ;
it had never occurred to him that she would
want to tamper with it, but he does not

gainsay her wish. He takes his knife from
his pocket and begins to unfasten the soldered
edges. In a moment they give way ; the
fragile token has held its treasure for an
hundred years, but it yields to the first rough
touch of this utilitarian day.

Bring it in here,' she says, going back into
the room ; ' we have only a moment.'

Glass, rims, tablet, hair, gold thread  the
whole contents of the little gift, which seems
to have lost its charm in the undoing  lie on
the table before them.

Kneel down,' says the girl laughing, ' and
give me that knife. Ah ! John, it is the
knife I stabbed you with.'

She lets it drop quickly, and, falling, it
breaks one of the thin convex glasses of the
locket.

It is broken I fear,' says John in amazed
sorrow, picking up the pieces as he stoops ; it
seems to him, somehow, to be an irretrievable
loss, as indeed it is, to Time.

Ah ! what a pity ! But never mind. I
do not greatly care for ornaments. Mr.

Denham said just the other evening that it
was odd, when I told him I only liked
diamonds.'

And I shall never have any diamonds to
give you.'

You ! oh ! the gift you give me  that is
different. No, John, no : I do not want that
relic, put it all into your pocket together.
Are these your mother's scissors V

He kneels down before her with his dark head
bent. She has unloved her hands again, and
she passes them lightly over his curly hair till
she severs a thick lock of it which twines round
her fingers. She puts it down on the table
with the scissors and then bends over her
lover and hesitates for a moment.

Tu es hen a moi,' she says, rapidly as a
breath, and her lips touch his hair like flame.
It is not a kiss. He could not say whether it
was her cheek or her hand that touched him.
He reads the passion of her tone into a kind
of benediction, for he has not caught her
words. But he puts his arms round her as he
kneels, and his head leans against her waist.

The warmth and peculiar softness of the seals
coat she wears almost overpower his senses:
the moment feels eternal : when he stirs he
could fancy himself awaking from a long sleep
or a swoon, and his eyes are heavy and hot.

As for her, she will lose it never, that
feeling of support and possession which his
clasping arms and throbbing forehead press
beneath her beating, yielding heart. There
springs to life in her the maternal element of
loving : she pities him for his pain in losing
her; as she frees herself there is compassion
in her hands and her voice is sad.

Come,' she says kindly, as if she would
console him, ' I shall lose my train.'

He pockets the debris of the broken
trinket, saving only the gold thread which he
twists round the lock of hair before she places
it within her glove in the hollow of her hand.

'It is a clumsy keepsake,' he says shyly ;
you ought to have cut it better.'

Yes, I have spoilt your head : I hope
you are not like Samson : I should be sorry to
steal your strength.'

And am I to have nothing ? ' He glances
at her wind-ruffled hair with wistful eyes.

There is no time : I do not want my head
spoilt : that matters. I will send you a yard
of hair if you like ; but it means nothing tome
to give it you. I am not sentimental,
John, and you must not be. Why I wanted
this, was for a sign of your existence : I am
not going to cherish it that I know of. It is
a proof to me that you exist and that, existing,
you are mine.'

Never doubt that,' he answers with a
sigh : he does not question her will : his heart'
has no such need of tokens, but his sigh
reproves her : she glances off the subject.

If you want a sign of my existence,' she
says laughing, ' look in the glass, if the wound
in your wrist is healed. For I have not only
stabbed you, but I have taken your scalp.
John, I feel that I have behaved like a wild
Indian.'

Like Longfellow's Minnehaha ?' says John
with a smile,  'the laughing water.'

They are standing upright now, facing each

other, and it seems to each of them that the
other's presence is all the world contains.
The mutual photograph upon their brains
must be a clear one, focused by such ardent
eyes. The afternoon is so quiet that they
hear the Denham mare pawing the flagstones
of the yard where John has tied her. She is
not used to waiting before she begins her
journeys.

She warns them of the flight of time : their
thoughts are in such unison that they do not
need exchange the warning. John reaches
down his hat and they go out.

It is already colder, and he does not stay
for a coat : is not the beating of his heart
enough to warm him to his feet and finger tips?
He has never taken any woman but his mother
in this little cart of his, which is a new purchase
of Lord Grenvers'. He has had no experience
in life like this drive with Waldine down his
favourite lanes, where there is not a single
passer-by to look at them askance. The sense
of doubled life, the satisfaction of the company
of this beloved and lovely woman,  it makes

all fresh as paradise was fresh to Adam after
the birth of Eve.

And Waldine's contentment is absolute ; the
swift motion, for their time is short, the light
noise of the wheels, the fanning air  above all,
the sense of moving towards a goal, which is
ever a joy to her  make all her senses keen
in the crystal day. Seated at his side, warm
in her close fine fur, she takes long looks up to
his face when his eyes are occupied with the
mare. She feels to know that face so well, to
love it so dearly. And is it not the most
beautiful thing in the world ? Her heart brims
over with possession and pride. The way the
cool air darkens and pales his cheek, the rare
closing of his lips to a soft encouraging whistle
which the Denham mare quite understands
without a touch from the whip  these things,
which are lessons to her, do not seem strange :
it vaguely occurs to her that when she drives
in London she will miss them.

Nor is he silent now : the familiar scenes
through which they pass are potent instigate to
speech. He tells her all his days: he explains

to her the country-side. She knows the road,
but she has driven it hitherto alone or talking
chiffons with Lady Green vers : it has been a sealed
record to her till now, of which he can unfold
the story. They only stop for one instant just
to catch full view of Whiteknyghts with its
great array of shining windows.

Yes, I see it,' says the girl smiling  ' big,
empty shrine of the " dear saint."  Ah ! mon
ami, if I were not here would you be there ? '

Of course,' says John, smiling too. He is
so happy that he can afford to make light of
his own constancy.

I wonder what her ladyship would say if
she met us. But, John, do you know, she
never sees any one : she always says to me,
* Here is a carriage, Val, how am I looking ? "
and when the carriage has passed, she says,
Who was it ? How did 1 look ? " '

Then she may meet us and welcome,' says
John : he hums a little air and then adds,
breaking it off short,  Is that what she calls

you ?

'That is what I am mostly called ; " Waldine"

is strange and formal : no one has ever called
me that.'

May I ? ' says John : it is the first direct
request he has made her. 'The " lady of the
woodlands ? " I should like to call you that.'

Very well,' she says contentedly, ' I am
Waldine to you. Val to the rest of the world.'

And Miss de Stair to Mr. Denham ? '

If you will : but you call your horse the
Denham mare.'

Will you christen her another name ? '

You can call her Countess Val.'

He looks troubled. ' I always forget your
foreign dignity, ' he says : ' does it matter ? '

Nothing matters,' she answers, looking up
anxiously at his face, * except '

His eyes meet hers : it is a long straight
road : the Denham mare has settled down into
a steady trot which she will not break till they
near the station hill where John and his love
must part. He gathers the reins into his
right hand and puts his left arm, being human,
round her waist.

Oh ! that is safe,' he says in a low tone,

and then lie draws her towards him and his
lips stoop to hers. Lovers of old time, long
dead, does not your dust thrill at their meeting?
. . Was the road so short \ was the pace so
fleet ? they have reached the station turning,
and a shrill whistle sounds on the bright air,
almost in their ears.

Just in time ! ' says the girl, panting with
fresh haste as she descends:  'No, John;
another yard and they will see you : I can run
these few steps more  Good-bye ! '

He leans over the cart, but she is on foot
already and she does not once look back. Where
is the good of looking at him when her eyes
are drowned with tears  most sudden tears 
of bliss ? Where is the good of looking at
him when his seal is set upon her mouth and
his image on her heart for ever ?

John Lyne drives down to Netherfield in
the afternoon, as it changes to chill. He goes
a long way round, he will not return to his
empty house. His face grows cold, his hands
numb, but his brain is dizzy and his pulses

throb. He has entered into the world of
unrest : he will know no more careless days
and no more dreamless nights. His life is set
henceforward to the tune of this girl's voice.
She has taken from him his strength and his
peace ; she has left him nothing but the sweetness
of her roseleaf lips on his.

She speeds through the gathering dusk,
sitting alone and motionless in the railway
carriage, feeling neither noise nor cold  spellbound,
silent, warm. All goes so well with
her. When she meets the carriage Mrs.
Lupton's train is still not due ; when she meets
Mrs. Lupton that lady is cross and tired, and
insists on bringing Mr. Collington home to dine.
His hotel is in Half Moon Street, and he can
go on there in the brougham to dress while
she slips on her tea-gown : they will have such
a cosy evening !

'Dear Yal, Tm afraid your time has been
dull, but I hope you had a pleasant luncheon.
You must tell me all about your day when
you've heard mine. See, Cecil, what a hostess
I am ! I ask her no questions, and then perhaps

she won't ask us any. . . .' Mrs. Lupton's tone
becomes suddenly lowered to the flirtation register.
When they arrive in Curzon Street she
has fifty notes to read ; there is also a letter
for Waldine with the AVhiteknyghts postmark,
from her devoted aunt. It is too long to read
at once, but the postscript attracts her eyes : 

'Poor John Lyne has been quite horridly
ill  pleurisy or something : he is all right
again, as far as he ever will be, but has lost
his looks  such a pity, for you know I had
the most idiotic penchant for his handsome
face : no one could sympathise with it now,
least of all you who hate invalids. Oh ! how
he would bore you ! health was his charm.
But who can be well in this arctic month ? I
am alive, but see nobody : my nose is like a
damson : is chinchilla really so much worn ?
ask Charlotte. . . . '

They are stupid and false,' says the girl to
herself passionately, 'they shall never know.'

And she locks up that day in her soul and
gives the key to memory.

CHAPTER VL

WALDINE WRITES

CuRzoN Street, Christmas Eve.

My own dear love !  These many days you
have lain silent in my heart : I have had no
need of speech. To-night you wake and call,
me : I rise and answer.

Why to-night ? I do not know. I tell you
always I am not sentimental : I do not
believe that anything is happening to you
that should distress me on your account.
I do not think that you are ill or that
you want me. But there are times and
times in love. It has its moods like the sea
poor old simile that has done duty so
often !  and to-night there is a full moon
tide of speech. . I take you out of my deep

VOL. n. 25

heart and I look at you : I love you : let us
take counsel together.

Confession first: mon amour, I have told
nothing to any one : I think you thought I should,
but it was impossible. Life is intricate : to throw
truth to people who don't know what truth is,
you might as well feed a serpent on flowers !
They cry out for something palpitating to
mangle, these cobras of gossip ; and you and
I will not be food for them. Do not look
solemn about it. Trust me, and all will be well.

All is well. John, I wonder whether
English girls often do what I have done  take
an independent journey to satisfy their . . .
caprice  curiosity  what was it ? and then
return to find that they have not been missed
and nothing is said. I feel I did a dreadful
thing, but it is not because I am found out ;
rather, I think, because I am so scot-free, and
my world rolls along so evenly again after the
kick I gave it. I have proved Mrs. Lupton's
maxim true : ' The big things of life remain
unknown.' But for all that they are not
unimportant.

What are you doing % I do not ask : I
know. You are asleep and you dream of me.
It is what I am doing that I want to tell you,
obedient to one of your last suggestions. You
were right to make it : it is good for me to
unfold myself to you. You are the peace and
the calm of my days : I feel myself nervous
and modern in face of your old-time simplicity
and strength. All about you and around you
now there is the immense quiet of the winter
night : leagues upon leagues of unbroken
silence which the town noises never reach.

John, I think of you in your little house as i4
were in a safe grave. It seems to me possible
happily possible  to turn my back upon
the town, to go far and to dig deep and to
find  you : and this ' return upon you ' is the
mainspring of my life. Here is my tendril
token of your hair before me on the table. I
think out all the way to you  the loud and
crowded terminus here, the long journey into
ever purer air, the small country station,
the hill, the road we went together, the lane
to your garden-gate, the pathway with the

roses at the end. I pass x that pathway : I
stand at the barred door. I do not knock,
I enter. It is all so still that I can think I
hear the snow fall. There is no light in the
passage now, no light in either room I know,
but I do not stumble : I go ghostlike up the
stair. Yes, you are safe at home, but you
are not safe from me. I come to you with
the burden of my life, with all its desires and
sighs. And at your door I knock. Oh ! my
love, do you sleep still ? Do you not hear my
tears upon your threshold ? must they fall
there ? . . .

Was it a thunderbolt ? was it a storm that
scared the vision ? Nothing, John, nothing
but the rumbling of some market-cart that
goes belated or beforehand up the street.
Here market-carts, and worse than market-carts,
are for ever scaring my visions. I feel
as if I had got into the heart of some great
beating machine, for which the fuel is the
lives of men. Sometimes when I look out of
my window I thank God for frost or rain.
At least they arc signs to me that there are

elements somewhere which bring gifts of
whiteness and wet. My window at White-knights
 I pant for it, I cannot stay longer
away. Every day it has some new surprise
for me ; some sober glory of winter colour,
some group of sheep or cattle that are at
home there and at ease. There is a farmer
pastures his cows in the park ; at eight in
the morning I see them bounding over the
grass. There is a gladness in the rustle of
their paces, crisp on the snow or thudding in
the thaw. It makes me happy to hear the
beasts begin their free and open day. A
whole long day, it must be so much to a cow
or a sheep ! Here too it may be much, but
it is a muchness of the wrong order  like a
day in the shambles for them.

John, ' my whole day,' was I to tell it you ?
Then it shall be to-day : that's easy. You
don't know what a London fog is ; I shall not
attempt to describe it. One feels as if one
were sitting under the shadow of some awful
and mysterious sorrow. One can imagine
one's self in hell. Sisyphus, Ixion, Tantalus 

in turn one is each and all. Mrs. Lufton hasa
special regime for fogs when she is in the
mood to avoid them. For there are days
when she is m the vein: then she goes out,
and heaven knows what befalls her ! To-day,
however, she was not willingly befogged, and
she fought the stars in their courses. Every
shutter was shut, every blind vas down ; we
played at its being evening. All the pretty
lamps were lit in the boudoir ; they would
amuse you, some of them, supported by
flamingoes, owls and peacocks  quite literally
ivory and apes and peacocks;'  we wore
dressing-gowns and discussed our neighbours.
"What we did ? we chose evening frocks,
availing ourselves of the various lights; mine
is yellow  an appalling colour by daylight,
like the yolk of an Q.gg. Faithful to her
appointment, a dressmaker appeared about
them, and things of so much moment are
not decided in an hour. Mr. Collington came
to luncheon of course and brought a couple of
young actors with him, who delighted in the
artificial glow and the real banquet. They

are getting up a little comedy with Mrs.
Lupton as the heroine, and they rehearsed it
in the afternoon : I stayed in the drawing-room
while they went to the empty music-room,
and before answering some notes I took
up a novel. The fog and the lamps together
had given me a headache, and I went to sleep
which is perhaps the reason why I cannot
sleep to-night, dear comrade of my vigil, and
perhaps it is not why ! I went to sleep and I
dreamed.  Of you ? Yes, first, and then that
Mr. Denham called  and behold ! it was nota
dream ! I awoke and rubbed my eyes ; he
was there in the flesh. What he said ? John,
you are tedious in your demands : I don't
remember. Yes I do. He gave me various
most interesting personal statistics, to which
I listened while I sat and wished that he were
you. He told me who his tailor was and
where he got his flowers ; and that he liked
the roses on my tea-gown, and that he liked
the set o/mj tea-gown, and that he liked mein
my tea-gown. Which was no trouble and
the reverse of unpleasant, but which did not,

if you will believe it, amuse me in the
least.

And then I told him what I thought of
him : I said I thought he was part of the
fuel ' for the machine of life in town and in
the country, to which he replied that he was
very inflammable; and what with the sleep
and the dream I felt so far away from him all
the while that I said, ' Really, do you know,
that's not at all bad for you,' without in the
least remembering that I was speaking to a
real man. At which he was good enough to
laugh not unkindly :  he is not unkind.

John, I am glad you are not rich and do
not wear button-hole bouquets. Mrs. Lupton
said the other day that she 'never got any
tonic out of a scent-bottle.' I am much of
her mind. It keeps one awake, it refreshes
even, but that is the most one can say to
praise it.

Perhaps, however, Mr. Denham is more
than a scent-bottle ; for  I had half forgotten
it  he became rather serious before our 
was interrupted. He referred again to the

demise of his mamma  which made me laugh,
the dear defunct being obviously resuscitated
only as the keystone to more vital relationship.
I suggested that Mrs. Lupton would be a
mother to him gladly if he would allow her.

'And you a sister, do you mean?' he said
imploringly.

I did not quite see how that followed, but
I admitted that the limit of my years would
allow of the relationship. And even then he
was not satisfied ; he said he did not want a
sister. ' Then,' I concluded brilliantly, ' I
shall have to be a mother to you myself
And upon that imaginative basis our friendship
rests for the present.  What ! my real love,
you are not laughing? you look puzzled but
not amused ? I hear you say, in that grave
voice of yours, that you do not want to be
Mr. Denham's stepfather. Very well, then,
very well : all that you wish is very well
to me. Yes ! best of all.

That's now; and which of us two, dear,
shall mind about the future ? That tiresome
future, it is buried deep enough this winter

while ; we shall not hear it start till spring.
Are you not satisfied ? Then come and see
for yourself. London is not so far.

I went to you once  did I not, or is it alla
dream ?  I cannot come again. Mrs. Lufton's
expeditions are ended for this winter ;
she took cold on that last journey, and is
always saying how fortunate I was to have
been safe at home. My conscience does not
sting me, for if ever I was ' safe at home ' it
was then ; with you, John, with you.

Persistent still ? I have said, ' Come and
see ! come and see that I do not forget you !'
but you want to know these little things, and
somehow, all the time, I want to tell you
them. Mr. Denham informs me that the filial
relationship demands a certain confidence ; I
reply that my time and my attention are at
his disposal on foggy days. He remarks that
he hopes it will be foggy all the winter ; I
rejoin that I have every fear his wish may be
fulfilled. There is then a long pause. Am I
sufficiently dramatic ? for you know the accents
of the dialogue. After the pause he said that

he congratulated  was it himself or me ?
that he had got so far. It seemed to me
that he had ' got ' not forward but backward
many weary years, as I found myself with so
full-grown a son, and I ventured that witticism
as well. To which he replied that anything
which neared us to each other seemed a step
forward to him. And, while I thought just
that same thought of you you may guess that
I was not sloan to retort to Ifiim that I found he
was ' quite forward enough ' already !

And it was almost directly after that repartee
that Mrs. Lupton came into the room,
triumphant from the completed rehearsal. . . .
As for us two, John, we are near enough !

How cold it is ! with fire and gas and
lamps I do not feel it here, but I know how
keen the frost is by all the little signs of
London winter  the way the flames burn, the
sounds one hears far off, the sleep, like a thick
cloak, that is upon one the instant one seeks
it. And you sleep sound, I know, nearer
Nature than I, in the home that will be mine
one day.

Oh ! love, love ! there is no rose left in
your garden jt'ithway now ! but this room is
full of roses . . . and they are not all artificial
roses either, for my adopted son sent me a
bouquet this evening in which there are real
rosebuds almost sweet. We went to the first
night of a new burlesque ; when I returned I
found you waiting in my room and sent away
my maid. . . . Here you still are, but I have
failed to write you my day, failed in the expression
of all I would express, only will not
fail in the expression of my love ! I love you
more than you love me, more than you know
that I can love. You think of other things
than love, you think / think of other things
than those ; I think of one thing only, love,
I think of you ! No future planned ; believe
I want no future  that will come. No past
remembered, for I have no memory of the
past  it was not yours !  But / am yours,

Waldine.

Come to me ! when you will, as you will,
only somehow come ! I want to prove you mine.

FROST

Proof ? what proof was needed ? Was he not
hers as wholly as the thorn-stem is the grafted
rose's ? He had no separate existence now,
no aim in life but just to be the standard o
her pride. How best to serve her ? He received
the letter on the 26th of December ;
the letter said,  Come,' and he went next
morning.

It was difficult, but there is a providence
for lovers : Lord Grenvers had long been
wanting a locomotive couch, adapted specially
to his infirmities ; it had been an old suggestion
of his that John Lyne should pay his first
visit to London-town in quest of this, and at
the same time he could take an ornament to

Curzon Street, which was Lady Grenvers'
Christmas gift to Yal, and which thus need
not risk the laden post. It was all settled in
five minutes, and settled without sacrifice of
truth.

Lady Grenvers had said to John,  It is
'polar ; if I drive to Netherfield I die : you
must order me some New Year cards ; only
there is no choice as there is in London.'

I suppose the London shops are very gay
just now,' he said in tentative reply.

What a wistful voice V put in his lordship,
whose daily interview with John Lady Grenvers
had unceremoniously interrupted, ' I believe
you'd like to go and see them ! '

I should like to go to London,' said John
frankly,' with a sort of passive wonder.

And you shall,' cried her ladyship ; ' and
take Val her pendant : I shall never wear that
pearl pendant again, Grenvers ; it was one of
your first presents to me and is only fit for a
girl ! And Val has so few things. It will
still be in the family, and he can get your
chaise longue  order it, at least  and bring

me my New Year cards. Could you not go
tomorrow 1 I really want them.'

Yes, gladly said John, who felt his heart
bound at the possibilities afloat towards him
on the spell of the easy placid voice. And
gladly, when tomorrow came, he went. Another
time it would have seemed a great event
this going to London ; it seemed less than
nothing now, as a mile walk is ajjt to seem a
step in the direction of the beloved. There
were subjects to be considered ; but not in
relation to London, only in relation to one
feminine atom befogged therein whose eye
were poor John's lodestars. There was the
question of dress, there was the question of
times, there was the question of behaviour.
To look worthy of her, to reach her and to be
what she would have him be  this was the
triple problem which extinguished all wonder
as it annulled all distance.

Before Lady Grenvers sent the pearl pendant
across the park to John's home it had flashed
above her mental horizon that she might be
promoting a possible meeting between her

niece and him. But it only occurred to her
as the light for another lamp of self-approbation.
She wrote outside the packet, ' To be
left at 90 Curzon Street, Mrs. Lupton's ; you
need not ask for Mrs. Linton' and slept
soundly under the warm glow of her discretion.
He will have plenty else to do, she thought.

So John registered a mental vow that he
would not ' ask for Mrs. Lupton,' and snatched
his few hours' sleep with a conscience only at
all disturbed by the triple problem. And
when he woke ere daybreak it was solved.
He would just let things slide ; no forethought
thus far could have bettered fate's. He dressed
himself at dawn in his plain Sunday clothes ;
that they were not the clothes in vogue never
suggested itself to him, nor did he balance in
his mind whether they became him as well as
the costume of his daily wear. They were his
better clothes ; there was no choice. In his
breast-pocket was the box containing the
pendant, laid alongside of Waldine's letters,
and therefore safe with his life ; in an outer
pocket was a card on which his name was

written and his address, in case mishap befell
him. London was for him a sort of violent
engine, like the train. ' If I'm killed anywhere,
they shan't have to find her letter to know my
home.'

What he looked like ? Very like a gentleman,
only a touch more manly than most.
The boots were not very shapely and the hat
was wrong, but the walk was such as a prince
might have envied, and the head was as
handsome as a god's. His covert coat was
permissible in town as in the fields ; its earthy
tint became him very well : the general effect
was sombre.

Why, John,' said Mrs. Lyne, ' where's your
coloured scarf ? you don't look half smart for
London.'

Oh ! I'm not going a holiday, mother,' he
answered :  ' It's sober earnest this is, and lots
to think of.'

And much he did think in the train and
much in the streets, but it was not much of
London. It was one thought only  ' Waldine,
Waldine, I come!'

VOL. II. 26

After his four hours' journey, for the morning
train was slow, the day seemed younger in
the city streets than he had left it at Nether-field.
He had this day before him, for there
was a late train back ; and he found himself
in the neighbourhood of the shops for his
commissions.

It did not strike John to drive : he walked
gravely along the foggy thoroughfares ; visited
the place, somewhere in the Strand, for Lord
Grenvers' couch ; and made his way through
Soho into Regent Street ftr her ladyship's cards.
There was an embarrassing choice. He looked
in window after window till perplexity as well
as dust was on his face.

Perhaps,' he said to himself at last, ' perhaps
she would. . . .'

It was half-past one o'clock ; he did not
feel hungry. He went down Conduit Street
and Breton Street. Berkeley Square ! they had
told him that was near his goal.

Afterwards John remembered best of all
his London wanderings the last time he asked
his way to 90 Curzon Street. It was just

opposite to Vanstone House, where the
statue stood dripping under leafless boughs in
shivering feminine contrast to a well-clad
policeman who was contemplating her with
unsympathetic contempt. Mrs. Lupton would
have delighted in the contrast between his
stalwart warmth and that modest chill of hers
which was so much more permanent. And
the group detached that lady's image in John's
mind.

Does Mrs. Lupton live about here V asked
John.

I beg your pardon, sir,' said th astonished
policeman ; and then after a second glance,
which somehow flushed John's temples, he
added, ' I suppose you're from the country ;
don't you know the address V

It was rather a blow to John Lyne, and he
was glad that the subsequent direction should
be plain even to a rustic intelligence, unaware
that of two easy routes his informant chose
the less direct  ' Back a bit and down Berkeley
Street ; past the bottom of 'Ay '111 ; then down
the little tunnel to the right, and there you are.'

It was very foggy, very cold, very still.
He skirted the dead wall and there was the
old-fashioned passage, looking like a vault with
its iron pillar and grimy steps.

Well,' said John to himself, ' it's not as
fine as the lodge at AVhiteknyghts. '

He swung himself down the stairs : the
clank of his footsteps, echoing along the
narrow walls, amused him : perhaps it was his
quickened walking that made this sudden heat
and glow about him ; his whole frame tingled
as he went. Perhaps. . . .

He stopped quite still ; he could not have
advanced a step.

Waldine ! '

She had entered the passage from the
Curzon Street end : indeed it was none other
than she, and, by a final miracle, she was
alone. Surely nothing could befall her between
Curzon Street and Dover Street, where
she was going to luncheon with some friends
arrived from abroad. Nothing did befall her,
but just this : to find the radiant moment of her
life upon the muddy way. So one finds Love.

She was looking exquisitely lovely ; even
her beauty could be heightened by contrast
with dark fur and the rich velvets of Mrs.
Lupton's choice. She had dressed herself with
unusual care, and in this dingy frame and
under this gray sky she was the very picture
of luxury and grace. She walked lightly and
demurely ; her femininity divined a man whom
she must pass  her air was the more reserved
her eyelids proudly drooped.

She came quite close to him : he spoke
aloud, ' Waldine.'

Pace from motion to stillness : lips from
red to white : heart from life to death. And
then with one soft word, with one short step,
lack to red lips and fuller life again.

No one came by : the world was going to
luncheon, and the world's underlings had
ceased purveying it. It was the siesta of
the little dark passage and this word its
midday dream. . . .

You see I have come,' he said at last,
smoothing her hair with his hand where his
lips had stirred it, for she seemed as if she

could not speak to him ; ' and it wasn't so
difficult either ; there were things to be done,
and luckily it fell to me to do them. . . .'

Never mind,' she answered, her senses
returning with the tints of her cheek, 'you
are here and we have met ; you were coming
to find me

I was coming to leave a case of trinkets
for you, from Lady Grenvers ; I was specially
told not to ask for Mrs. Lupton.'

And you would not have asked for her ;
would you have asked for me ? '

I don't know ; it seemed all bound to come
right somehow. AVill you have the trinkets \ '

No :  what do they matter ? you can leave
them by and by. John ! are you glad to seeme?'


Very glad ; but must you be always as
finely dressed as this in London ? '

She sighed. ' No, I suppose not; but I like
clothes, and I am going to such a luncheon
party  the De Lewes',  oh ! you don't know
and to meet royalty.'

Princes and princesses ? '

Not the whole Almanach De Gotha, John 
one English princess and some foreign potentates.
I knew the De Lewes well in Brussels ;
they are at Brown's hotel. The worst of
royalty is that one can't be late, and I don't
see my way to being ill at a moment's notice.'

No/ said John directly, 'you must go.
What time will it be over % '

I can get away at three. Meet me here
then. What shall you do meanwhile ? '

Leave the parcel at Mrs. Lupton's. '

It will take nq minutes, and there is an
hour and a half before you. Perhaps I can
escape before three, but Mrs. Lupton thinks I
shall stay the whole afternoon.'

I will wait for you here ; come when you
can. But Waldine, answer me one question.
Do you care for all this  I mean this gaiety
and pleasure % You are so young, you are so
bright and rare.'

You speak of me as if I were a gem, only
then youth would not add to my value. John,
yes, I care for it all : don't let me undervalue
or underrate things. I care for clothes and

compliments. But I care more for you ; even
with that same me which these things occupy
I care more for you than for them. You are
the great excitement of my life, the thing that
is most at my heart is to tell you how entirely
I love you.'

Oh, Waldine, Waldine, do you speak the
truth ? '

Absolutely. Walk demurely now, as you
saw me walking : there is some one coming
and I feel I am not behaving well. \Yhy in
heaven s name haven't you got a high hat on f

Is it wrong  this hat ? I never thought
and my coat ? '

Looking down from the hat to the coat,
she had to meet the eyes, so that the coat was
never commented upon : she laughed lightly
under her breath and they let the stranger
pass them.

What shall we do this afternoon ? Have
you any sort of plan ? '

I am to get some New Year cards for
Lady Grenvers.'

The very thing : we will go to a shop I

know of together, and choose them ; I shall
buy a thick veil, and then we can go in a
hansom. It is very shocking, but it does not
strike me as wrong. Does it you 1 '

Don't do it another day with Mr. Denham.'

Not with my son ? John, what a look !
He will be at the luncheon : I wish I could
take you. But you would hate it and I should
hate you there ; if you looked at the princess
I should die of jealousy. Do get a high hat,
there are plenty of shops in Bond Street. It
will be something for you to do, and I am
sure it will suit you. What is the time ? '

Ten minutes to two.'

I must go.'  They were standing on the
steps near the pillar.  ' Wish me a pleasant
morning ! I shall be thinking of you all the
while.'

Think of me thus ! '

He had taken her softly in his arms before
she was aware ; * Waldine ! ' he said, ' my wife.'

It was a whisper, like a breath of June.
Ah I how he loved her : even her exactions
were contented now.  That tenderness of his

embrace, that lover's utter gift of self  they
must have left a gust of summer between the
dark walls, a shock of warmth in the cold
pillar, for the next fortunate passer-by. What
was it wandering in the air ? a soul exchanged
or lost ?

A hientdt', she said ; and then, for there
were footsteps, she was gone.

He watched her cross the road and walk
with supple easy motion up Hay Hill. Then
he went through the passage again without
seeing a yard of it : and luckily he could not
miss his way to Mrs. Lupton's house.

He had an hour before him : he went to
Bond Street and bought himself a hat.

I want a high hat, please,' he said, ' like
they are wearing now.'

It was the latest defect licensed : it made
him look very tall, and it was not quite easy
on his curly head. Moreover, it cost a great
deal of money ; that mattered more.

In effect he had left himself a margin of
thirty shillings for the day's expenses, of which
the hat took twenty-five. But n shillings

would suffice for his refreshment, and he had
not told his mother that he had thought of
bringing her a present from London. He put
on the new hat and pocketed the change : he
gave up that notion of a present for his
mother.

Where shall I send your other hat, sir ? '
He did not think of having it sent to the

station : he did not want to give an address :
Will you keep it for me till I call ? ' he said.

(So that perhaps John's hat is at the hatters
still !)

He had a travelling cap in his pocket, that
would do for the train. As for the new one,
he would slink in, at home, and hide it, or
throw it out of the carriage window before he
reached Netherfield : he knew it was an useless
purchase, but it was Waldine's wish that he
should have it  it seemed like the price of his
blissful hour with her.

Now for some dinner,' he said, as he left
the shop. He had a sovereign that Lady
Grenvers had sent him for the New Year
cards ; he must keep that intact : he had his

return ticket and he had five shillings : he was
hungry and would have no further expenses.

Stay ! the cab in which he was to drive
with Waldine by and by ?

He stood still outside the Grosvenor
restaurant and whistled softly.

Then he took his hand out of his pocket
and buttoned his coat.

He had breakfasted betimes and it was
long past his dinner-hour, but there was no
help for it, he could not afford to dine now.
If he could get some bread and cheese ?

But that is a difficulty in Bond Street.
There was a baker's : but by some odd chain
of inferences his high hat prevented his going
there. He had a feeling that it would look
unusual. On the whole, it was easier to be
hungry. ' By Jove,' he said, ' I would eat
my hat if I could.' He could hardly return,
however, to the shop that he had honoured
With his patronage and offer there the old hat
in exchange for a meal. He had put on an
instinct with his London chimney-pot and he
was obliged to obey it. Neither bright

public-house, discharging muddy workmen,
nor pastry-cooks, with supercilious Hebe,
satisfied the requirements of this instinct.
He took exercise instead of luncheon. It was
not so strengthening, but it was cheaper.

The shops bewildered him with their show
of jewels and silks ; but one would not have
guessed his wonderment. Like all country-bred
Englishmen, he had a shyness which
looked very like pride. It was the first time
that this shyness had absolutely gnawed his
vitals, but in the extreme form it shaped
itself into extreme reserve ; just because he
was hungry and shy, his air was consequential
in its nobleness and languor.

People looked at him too ; perhaps what
was attractive in his aspect was that it was
not yet levelled to the ordinary London tone.
Without being odd he had the impropriety of
being brilliantly handsome, and of having the
flesh-tints not effaced by lassitude or dirt.
The hour passed very quickly; his mind
photographed all sorts of pictures  carriages,
horses, corners, faces, but he was unaware of

most of them ; it was an automatic process.
It was only when he turned into Grafton
Street again and saw the Bond Street panorama
still before his eyes that he knew he had
observed intently, that he knew he should
remember. He was in Berkeley Street at ten
minutes to three : she might escape, she had
said, before the appointed hour. He waited a
quarter of an hour, half an hour, an hour 
patient as a dog. It rained. He sheltered
himself under the portico of the passage and
made skirmishes of observation. Presently
from his covert he saw Waldine in a hansom
with Mr. Denham : she fronted John as they
drove down Hay Hill : she was laughing  he
could see that ; her lips were like a scarlet
flower, her teeth like millet ; but he could not
see the way her eyes sought out his figure in
the dark. Despite his hunger and chill, he
felt a great access of angry jealousy inflame
him. He would not be the first to drive with
her that day then, despite her having characterised
the proceeding as very shocking ?
He had told her rightly what his simple

country-breeding meant, with its heritage of
single-hearted passion. He could renounce
her ; he-had hardly sought the boon she had
bestowed on him ; but he could not share her
with another. She would have to understand
that, once and for all.

He straitened himself ud almost fiercely
and lit a cigar to calm his nerves ; the look in
his eyes as the match showed them was a look
of heavy care. How long he might have to
wait he did not know, but it never occurred
to him to go elsewhere. Her word was law.

A sudden rattle of wheels round the corner
of the square  her radiant face was before
him again ; she was alone in the hansom now ;
that flamelike vision burnt up all the smoke
of jealousy and wrath.

Stop,' she called out to the driver, ' stop !
there's my  brother! . . .'

And then she fell back laughing and
covered her burning face with her hands.

Oh John,' she said, ' how different you look
to Launcelot in London ! '

FIRE

John got into the hansom dexterously enough,
considering the difficulties of the vehicle, only
bruising the unaccustomed hat against the
drooping glass. As he settled himself beside
her it seemed to him that Waldine expanded
like some lovely tropical flower ; the sweetness
of her presence made his heart faint with
longing. Excitement, flattery and delicate
fare had all been to her a sort of prelude to
this feast of love. She was warm in every
limb ; her sapphire eyes and vivid lips flashed
smiles ; and this meeting long deferred was to
be the crown of her delight.

That John was jealous, hungry, cold  ill
with the weary and unusual day  never once

occurred to her mind. Was anger possible ?
were there such terrors as fatigue and chill '?
How should she know? she felt like a fairy
queen, commissioned to fling glory through
the town with her fairy prince beside her.

Shut the doors she said, still laughing, ' I
have told him where to go ! What I have
been through to come to you I your providence
almost failed us. . I was in such a
hurry to get away that they all wanted to
know my plans. Mr. Denham said he should
walk back with me ; then I said I was going
in a hansom, and he asked if he might com
too  " Give your brother a lift," he said, for the
cabman to hear him.  I was rxiaee : when we
got into Charles Street I suddenly remembered
that Mrs. Lupton would not like it. I insisted
on his getting out. I drove down
Queen Street and then up Chesterfield Street
I passed him again but he never saw me.
I told the cabman to go to Waterloo Place,
and to Waterloo Place he is going. I took
a hint from Mr. Denham, about whose relationship
to me I am getting horribly confused, and

VOL. II. 27

stopped him to pick up ''my other brother." 
Why don't you speak to me ? Do you mind
the lie?'

I don't mind anything now,' said John,
thawing a little in her sunshiny presence, and
taking her fluttering hand in his ; ' have you
been happy all this while away V

Am I late ?  it seemed endless. Oh ! yes,
I have not been bored : I have a lucky consciousness
moreover that I have not been dull.
I had always rather be bored than dull : one
can blame others if one is bored, but one
cannot forgive one's self if one is dull ! '

Dull, my star ! '

Behind a fog often enough, without you,'
said the girl gently, her eyes brimming with
tears. ' John, I must buy a veil : 1 have seen
three people I know already. Is it not extraordinary
that one cannot drive a moment
in Piccadilly without seeing three people one
knows  and nearly always just the three
people one would rather not see, aren't they V

John looked out of the hansom : there were
not three people that he knew in all London.

Where are we going ? ' lie said after a
moment.

Waldine's answer came from behind the
muff, with which she was shielding her face
from the eyes of a familiar friend.

To a shop where we can get cards and
veil and all  a sort of general village shop,
like the one at Netherfield Gate ! Do you
like driving through these streets ? I adore it.
Look at the lamps ; they have hardly been
put out for days ! We don't live by sunlight
here ! '

'Don't you?' said John rather foolishly,
contemplating what was mere sunlight to him.

You have not said three words she went
on quickly : ' say three words to me, you say
nothing. I must have you say three words to
spoil the sight of those three hideous people ! '

/ love you!

Silence ; then after a pause. ' I surrender,
John, I cannot talk to you : I can write to
you, and often when you are away from me I
can talk to your ghostly presence hour by
hour. But now that you are really here, you

are like a weight upoti my heart and I  I
think  on yours.'

You will have all life to talk to me in, I
trust,' said John.

I think I shall never utter : don't you see,
John, that for us two there is nothing but
love ? If you were any other man I know,
there would be a hundred safety valves of
speech : I could let off the steam. But now
. . you would not care to hear about the
princess' bonnet or the grand duke's appetite,
would you ?  and he did not eat prettily, par
"parentheses /'

John pushed back the offending hat ; she
had never even observed it. ' I care for
nothing here but you, Waldine,' he said :  ' I
came here to see you and I have seen you.
All that you tell me pleases me, because you
say it; but the only thing in London that
there is for me is yourself. Do you not
understand ? You have only to be with me
for me to be happy : it is not what you say
or do that moves me, it is you. Why are
you silent now V

Oh ! go on speaking to me ! Do you
know what your words are ? There is not a
fibre in my heart that they do not thrill : I
think it is your voice that I love.'

I hope that it is me that you love, my
darling, me and my love of you.'

 It is not that latter, I know ; it has
nothing to do with it. I love you as one
loves fresh air and music, reckless if they have
returning love for one or not  never, I fancy,
thinking about that at all. It is your voice,
your hands, your kisses that I love, that make
the world for me.'

'If I were dumb and maimed and absent '

Oh don't talk like that ! horrible ! how
can I tell ? it would not be you. Absent, yes !
I can stand a certain absence . . . would you
love "hue if I were maimed and dumb ? '

Better, if better can be, but it can't : you
are myself for me, Waldine ! A man loves
himself: he talks about it little, but see the
pains he takes to get it happiness : does he
love himself less for such troubles as those ? 
no, but more. It seems to me dreadful, often,

that the only scope for my compassion towards
you is the risk of your love for me.'

I don't want your compassion : I have
made no sacrifices : I have added you to my
life.'

But you are going to make them ? . . .'

Of course ; but if do  or rather when I
do  they won't seem sacrifices. Don't you
see? when I go to you, I. shall go because I
love you just too well to do without you any
longer. Why did you put that tone into your
voice ? Do you think I would ever go back
from my word \ For one thing only in life I
have complete contempt  for its timidity. I
have no qualms, all things are for the best.
Love is the best of things ; there is no second
best.'

You will marry me and share my grooved
career ? '

I have said it ; I will say it as often as
you will hear me. You must trust me, John ;
believe me I was born respectable ! cowardice
is a question of breeding. You have my
word. Listen ! If I ceased to love you I

would marry you still if you wished it. If
you wished it I would even marry you if you
ceased to love me  that's harder, but one does
not give one's word for nothing, one gives
one's worth with it : I have thought out all
this. But I have only begun to love you,
John ; I shall take all my days to learn the
whole lesson ; and you  you have not ceased
to love me yet ? I love you far too well to
dream that you will cease to love me yet '

Not yet,' said John. Again the little
word, the great significance, the mutual thrill.

They were driving down Waterloo Place
now, and it was darker turning from the glare
of Piccadilly; the cold damp air blew fresh
vigour into Waldine's nerves, as if it were a
breath of the sea ; she felt her face cool above
the throbbing of her frame, like ice on fever ;
she stooped it against his shoulder.

Waldine,' he said, ' when shall it be, this
gift of our life to each other V

Oh ! when you will,' she answered ; ' how
can I decide ? we must do what is wisest, and
you are the best judge of that. It bothers me

to make plans, but I shall not quarrel with
yours

Let us think said John gently, ' where
we are . . . He set his mind to ponder.

We are at Howell and James,' she answered
quickly, with a sense of relief, ' and
we have half an hour's work before us ;
give the cabman eighteen pence ; we will be
economical and not keep him ; put on as
brotherly a look as you can, and follow me ! '
The audacity that was upon her was like
possession.

She bought a veil, for which John madly
longed to pay, but the price of which astonished
him greatly. She tied it closely over
her face and set about the selection of poor
Lady Grenvers' New Year emblems as blindfold
as fortune. The warmth and comfort
of the place was new life to John ; starved
and frozen as he was, he glowed and thawed ;
the look of perfect happiness on his flushed
face gave it an ideal  almost transparent 
beauty. Through her veil Waldine watched
him with intense pride. He seemed to her

like a god : the notion that he was straitened
for small change would have been incredible
had it presented itself to her mind ; but she
never thought of him as any way dependant.

Buy me this, John she said when the
parcel was completed, with the air of one who
confers a favour.

It was a little scented sachet of white satin
with a rose outside it  not a thing which she
liked even, not a thing that she needed or
on which she could fasten any association
with the day. He bought it with his last
half-crown.

They went out presently into the street ; it
was nearly five o'clock. The thickness of her
veil prevented her from feeling chilled ; to
John the keen air struck like rain, all saturated
as it was with fog. Strange, for he had never
used to be one to think of weather !

I must be home soon after n', said
Waldine ; * there is a crowd of people coming,
and I have no sort of excuse. We will walk,
John. Oh ! it is not like Whiteknyghts
walking, is it ? '

She paced quickly, but it was not fast for
him ; they had turned southward and went
down the broad steps towards St. James' Park.
They made their way more slowly along the
skirting avenues and by Constitution Hill to
Grosvenor Place, for the Green Park was shut ;
the darkness, the sense of security, the nearness
to the beloved combined to Waldine's entire
elation.

That is where the Prince of Wales lives,'
she said ; * Mrs. Lupton means him to distinguish
me next season. Perhaps next
season we shall be settled in the country and
I shall have forgotten Marlborough House as
much as you will.'

We have such soft evenings at Netherfield,'
said John, ' in summer weather ! Ah, love,
last summer I did not know that the world
had anything like you  is not that strange %
There you were all the time growing up forme,
and there was I all the time waiting for
you ; longing often in the fields, those August
evenings, for some one different to the girls I
saw, to walk with me between the hedgerows

or in the cornfields. I used to wonder how I
should find the sweetheart I wanted ; she
seemed a dream. Till I saw you, and then the
dream faded suddenly out ; because you were
so much more w and fair than the face it held !
How soon you filled my heart  how full you
filled it ! '

Waldiue listened, listened ; his voice, with
its slight throat sound, deepened from fatigue
and vibrating with passion, lulled her into an
ecstasy of which their motion through the
winter air was like the pulse ; she felt as if
they throbbed together in the world without:
volition of their own or individual being.

It was very dark along the lonely road ;
only a few saunterers, who did not heed them,
saw that John had stolen his arm round the
girl's shoulder and that she was walking with
her head against his breast. Under the pressure
of this air, so charged with secrets, he
could tell her his at last. He spoke it as
proximity made it more clear to his own sense :
' I loved you from the first ; I shall love
you till I die. My eyes are blind when I do

not see you, my arms empty when they do
not hold you. For my heart you are life and
death, for my soul you are heaven.'

I cannot stay in London now without
you,' said Waldine after a pause ; ' you have
changed it all for me by this one visit. I did
not know it could contain such bliss. Ah !
John, what immense happiness time holds.
Driving sometimes with Mrs. Lupton I have
thought how charming town-life was with its
gaieties, its perpetual occupation ! I have passed
by Hyde Park corner and I have seen people
sauntering about and never suspected that the
saunterers might wholly despise the busy
drivers, never thought that I should soon
stroll here with my beloved.'

So this is Hyde Park corner,' said John
as they came out on the bewildering lights.

Yes ! and do you see the fog ? we have
hardly felt it  at least I, for you look strangled
and John, I said that every foggy day I was
at Mr. Denham's disposal to give him my
maternal counsel. Do you recollect ? I wrote
to you all about it. Very likely he is waiting

for me now  an idle son with a face full of
confessions.'

Let him wait.'

For ever and a day ! I promise you, now
and for always, that whenever I am with him
I will think of only you.'

That's a pretty promise ! will you keep it?'

With my life ! . . . Love, / must go ; it is
late and I have no excuse  and you must go 
j must think of it ! you have to catch your train ;
I know there is one about six, but we have
loitered here so long you have no time to
spare ; you must take a hansom.'

What are you going to do this evening
while I am hurrying away from you  so fast
so fast ? '

Only heaven and Mrs. Lupton know ; we
have to dine out, else I could avoid the rest.
And anyway it will be long past ten before
you are at home by that slow train ; I suppose
you must go. . . . It is like taking the life
out of my body. Write to me when you are
gone.'

She tied the veil across her face aofain  the

face which John had bared to kiss in the
dusky avenues  and they walked silently along
the south side of Piccadilly. The novelty
of being side by side had become suddenly
familiar : they felt as if they were about to
break off a long while of life together. They
threaded the streets  presently, and it was by
the little dark chapel in Curzon Street that at
last they parted. Many a parting, without
doubt, ere theirs had that little chapel shielded,
many a parting has it shielded since, but
seldom one, perhaps, where the usual mood
was so entirely reversed. Of these two beautiful
and youthful lovers here the girl had all
the enterprise and ardour of a boy, the man
had all the docile constancy of a woman.
Waldine was in the pause of a crowded life,
even physically fuller than John's. This
violent passion of love was the one peaceful
instant of her day ; she was going on from
strength to strength because of it. Well fed,
warm clad, the crimson of superb health staining
her soft lips, she was, as it were, just
wasting a breathing space of existence in

company of the idol she had chosen. As for
him, chilled, hungry, choked with unaccustomed
poison in the air  every nerve and fibre strained
in rapture of earnest, self-upbraiding love 
this was the central pang to which all his
hopes had rounded. When this good-bye was
done he had to get his endless journey over
as he best could, and to live by its remembrance
tortured with jealous pain till kindly fate
might bring him one chance more. And yet
the gift was his, for all that the search was hers.

Say one thing to me, love,' she said,
gazing into his dear, tired face with starlit,
dewy eyes ; ' one word that T may hold within
my heart for ever.'

Kemember,' he answered her, ' once more
remember this is all to me. Withhold everything
or withhold nothing now. I give you
this last chance. I am not cruel  I can
forgive. But choose ! Waldine, my queen, in
the sight of God above us, are you my wife
or not ? '

Yours only, yours ever,' she said in a sigh
that was the echo of his breath.

And then he kissed her aoain

to'

Ten minutes afterwards he was running,
as fast as one can run in London, through
drizzling wet to the station ; and Warlike,
her face only the fairer, her hair only the
sleeker, for the damp, was turning to Mr.
Denham's confidences, from among billowy
sofa-cushions, the inattentive shell of her ear,
in which the humming song of contented
passion was yet awake like music.

THE END OF BOOK III.

CONTEMPT

VOL. II. 28

JOHN LYNE's love-letter

Whiteknyghts Cot, New Year's Eve.

My dearest girl  That is the way that
Keats began his love-letters, and I suppose
Keats had a sort of notion of the right wa}\
That at least is what you are to me, that and
more.

At last I have your leave to write to you 
a leave I hardly dare to take. To bring you
myself, that is one thing, because you have
deigned to accept me, but to bring you my
thoughts, that sounds bold.

Yet surely this is the time and this the
place, if ever anywhere it can be true that I
should write to you as mine.

Waldine, this paper is not worthy of you,

this ink is not clear enough, this pen is not
fine enough. Only the hand that guides the
pen is jours enough ; nothing else enough, but
yours enough, my dear.

What shall I wish you for the coming year ?
in an hour or so it will be here, and everything
is so quiet and the air so still and keen that I
almost fancy I can hear its wings. Perhaps
they're the old year's wings, though, that I'm
so loth should leave us. Stay a bit, old
fellow, you have been the best of friends !
But he won't stay : he is going : and what of
his successor ? I think I'll wish that he may
bring you happiness ; nothing besides ' matters
much,' as you would say.

And you shall give me in return one of
your glancing, omnipotent wishes  for health,
I think : there is no need for you to wish me
happiness ; it is in your own gift.

It makes me half ashamed  only that
shame is not in love at all  to have to want
that you should wish me health. I have been
bad again with that same illness, and it's all
my own fault. I played the fool by hurrying

to the station after our walk together, and
got a sort of chill on the journey, after the
glow you put in me, I fancy. Anyway it was
indoors for me, and no more chances of sporting
the London hat  not even for New Year's
Day ! All the old trouble of cough and blood-streaks
again ; and it goes on still, though
lessened.

And his lordship is ill, and chafes for me to
go to him ; and they say her ladyship is almost
always in her rooms, for fear of draughts, 
and  well ! you see, in fact, we want you back
again to put our lives to music !

For me you are health and summer : I have
no comparisons for your presence ; but when I
shut my eyes and think of you it is as if a
lilac bush in spring were in my room, and on
every bough of it a bird were singing.

You have never seen this room ; it's very
simple. I wonder what you would do with it
if you had it to alter  that passes all my
guessing. It's my bedroom ; and it's got a
nice window with a red curtain, now pulled
back to show the moonlight : and what besides

? a table and an arm-chair  that's newly
added  and a bit of carpet, on which Sep 
that's short for September  Sep, my collie,
Flirt's successor, is asleep before a bright fire.

And here's me, a poor sick fellow that loves
you  that last quality seems to dignify me to
my self  in an old shooting-coat and with an
old pipe for all companion, which, by the way,
IVe let go out already thinking of you.

Me, Waldine, me, what am I ? Just your
slave ; but none the more merry for being such
a wholly useless slave just now. If I were a
poet, or a bit of a writer of any sort, I shouldn't
mind it so much. But this letter when it's
written will be the longest piece of writing
I've ever done, by a great deal, if I say half
that's in my heart to say.

Are you tired of it already % Oh ! I'm not
without qualms. How am I to interest you ?
I only know one subject of very great interest,
and that's a subject you ought to know a good
deal more about than I do, because, my love,
it is your own dear self. But the qualms are
in absence only ; when I am with you I have

none. It seems to me then that I can make
your life. My love is like a deep well : when
I get outside of myself to see it I am struck
by its small surface, but when you sound it I
get a hint of its capacity. All the same it is
you that fill the well. Till you filled it
with the water of love and the light of life it
was merely a hole in. my heart.

That was what ached for emptiness those
summer evenings. Sometimes I have stretched
myself along the grass, almost in physical pain
for what ? I did not know then ; it was
only an immense desire of something vague,
which something vague has shaped itself to
palpable you.

Now the fulness of the well, how to bear
it ? Now the answering arms, how to support
the embrace ? how to wait for it, how to claim
it ? Love, who knows all these things but
Love, whose moods they are ?

Those lonely summer evenings, how indefinite,
how hazy they were ! to-night how
changed the sky ! I wish you could have
seen the sunset. We have winter  arctic

winter  a black frost, not a breath of mist,
not a trace of fog from morning to morning,
absolute crystal clearness in which sun and
moon are plain to see and stars are intimate
lamps. One feels one could blow them
out, if the revelation did not hold one's breath.
I get up and go to the window  was it hours
ago that sunset flamed itself away in saffron
and purple and gold ? Hours or centuries was
it \ What has this deep heaven to do with
that burst of passion ? Oh Love ! the depth
of this dark canopy, the calm and silence of it
which are not death's calm or silence because
of the pulsing stars. Oh Love ! the glory of
the risen moon, which was so faint and pale in
the flooded sunset sky.

It will pass, this fiery insupportable hour
which shakes our senses till we hardly discern
life's full moon dawning for the flush of marriage
saffron all around. Our heaven will
darken, deepen, grow more mystical and
still.

And then the silver light. Waldine, I
have not much to give you : I bring you a

night of stars ! Let the crescent sail in it till
it reach the perfect round.

That's what it seems to me, the life I offer
you  a night of stars. Will it content you,
sweetest, best, and least considerate of self,
after the garish sky ?

Oh ! but the worst of it is this, you ought
to look for noontide, not for moonlight. My
heart misgives me that the sky so bright above
you now is really not sunset's but dawn's.

What if I shall have spoilt your day ?
What if my silver moon and quiet starry night
should find you cold, regretful ever of a vanished
morning \

Already you have spoken me my word of
comfort. You said you had no fears ; you
would own to no regrets. It was easier to
speak in simile  it seemed to shield my poorness
from myself  but that won't do. Let
me show you what it is that we have done.

We have plighted ourselves to each other
for life or death. We shall live always in the
same house, we shall lie for ever in the same
grave. If my station be low, if my grave be

far away, your station and your grave must
be with mine. Be certain that the great glory
that this holds for me holds no reverse for
you. I think we could not live here : that
you will not mind, but realise it once for all.
Our place would be anomalous. Will you
come with me abroad ? Whither you will ;
for me it need not be far, I have so few
acquaintances that I need avoid ; but what of
you % I do not want to weary you with
details, but what could I do in Europe ? I
am the merest Englishman. I think our home
must be American, or in Australia. I do see
somehow there a sphere for me with my
bounded knowledge, a possible wide, hajpy
life for you with your boundless courage and
love. Rustic life  almost wild.

Details I will not give you : if you realise
this, you will not want to be precise about the
where. I will find out all about that. Then
comes the when ? Life is not long : will you
not marry me soon, my love of loves ? My
people are old and well cared for : they have
plenty for their lives laid by : I have been

independent of them for some time past,
saving my means. And mine is yours. Yes,
I have the wings to take us, have you the will
to fly ? Lark, nightingale, dove, what bird
are you that you will make your nest with a
poor daw like me ?

Wife, does it vex you to think that we
must go so far ? Oh ! it is lucky you are young :
surely you are quite free ? London has no
links for you yet, the country-side no chains.
We will forge links and chains out there which
would make the desert home. Now is the
moment. Let us forestall time and death ! .

Come back, and let us speak about it in this
frost until we make the snow thaw with our
promise : we will talk it over all the spring,
and let us go from summer to summer and
find next December an Australian June.
You ought to go a sea voyage,' the doctor
said this morning ; ' you would shake off this
illness altogether so.' And saying it he turned
my heart over in my body with a bound.
Let me build the scheme ! Say you 'yes.' I
ask no more counsel. Come summer noon.

come winter night, no weariness, no chill shall

ever reach you. Through my brain first must

pass any shadow that shall fall upon your eyes,

through my breast force its way any pang

that shall stir your breath to sighing.

I am between you and the world henceforth.

You must peep at it over my shoulder. Mis

view of the world ? Oh love, my world is you !

Your faithful lover,

John.

Midnight.  There go the bells! my life
upon your faith.

God bless you, my darling.

WALDINES REPLY

CuRZON Street, January 2nd.

Yes ! ' you ask it : I say it. ' Yes ' with shut
eyes and fingers in my ears, ' yes ' vigilant
and listening. Why are you troubled ? why
do you make plans ? I have no troubles and
I make no plans. I take you, you take me :
all will be well.

And seriously, my own (my very own I
know for time and for eternity), I am not
wholly irresponsible. I have a sense of
honour : you seem to think I haven't ! In
other senses I am wanting, I have no sense of
distance. England, Italy, Australia  where
that latter is I am most uncertain ; but anyway
the three countries are under one sun, in

one air  better air or worse  and for me they
hold, or may hold, but one presence. I have
a sense of hurry though : don't hasten things !
I mean don't hasten great things : hasten
your coming or my going  our meetings and
our partings shall be how or where you will.
But why disturb a current of existence that
can be as calm as ours ? Do you want to
leave Whiteknyghts and your people and my
uncle ? why should you ? See my prudence :
it is obviously,  nay ! it is inevitably, right.

First of all you have to get well. It sounds
rather dreadful, but your illness is perfectly
intolerable to me. What's the use of chopping
words ? I who greatly desire to tell you
everything that befalls me, should I not tell
you first what I unjust have. I must have you
well again, John, well without more delay.
Don't think either that I grieve because this
illness is, as some would say, my fault.
Honestly, it is not that which grieves me. It
is this : the first thing that I ask of you is
health; devotion afterwards, but capacity before
all else. You must bury sickness with the

buried year: 'alms for oblivion,' John, you
must put weakness into ' Time's wallet.' You
will not disappoint me ?

And you must try and be practical  reasonable
first and practical next. Dearest, I have
a new cream satin dress.  (Oh ! there is something
of my aunt in me, and I never knew
it !)  It was not made for the backwoods.
By and by I will dress myself in serge or
print  nay, in sackcloth for your sake : but
with a new cream satin from Elise and with
you at my side  for what is that path across
the park when I am once at home ?  why
should I not enjoy the pride of both ?

How you have made me argue ! and it is
all such a trifle : you trust me, do you not ?
you are not jealous ? Well then do not be
impatient ! do not spoil tranquil ease by a
snatch at ecstasy with risk. Let us have
peace with honour ! '

These last words have made me lausfh.
They read as if I did not wish to be your
wife ! I have no wish in life but that : it ends
up all my plans. But it eiids them : the plans

beyond are yours. Do you not understand ?
Once given, I lose myself, and rightly. If I
could think for one instant that you doubted
me when I say solemnly that I love you, then
illogical as it sounds  I would marry you
tomorrow ! But you cannot doubt my love
for you any more than I doubt yours for me.
And I do not doubt that at all ; did not doubt
it before I had your letter, do not doubt it
now.

Your letter ! all this while I have not
praised it : I have no words of praise. Dear,
one who loved you less might praise it more
than I.

There I stop short  because  because I
do not want to be ambiguous. I will not
have you think I cannot praise it because I
am too much moved. The reason, the real
reason is that it does not wholly please me.
To think that I should be so difficult !

Once I said to you I was not absolutely
certain that I wished you to love me. Of one
thing I am quite certain : I do not want you
overmuch to express your love. I want you

in my life for many reasons, but the chief
reason is for repression of myself. Let me
be the fluent speaker  it is so easy. Be you
the limitless and throbbing silence. Close up
my chattering day, voiceless interpreter ! . . .
Oh me ! choosing all these fine terms, am I
still afraid of being truthful ? Is the real fact
merely that your way of speaking is not
what I would have it be ? Is your letter,
despite its devotion, or because of its devotion,
a sort of weariness ? I would to God I
knew. . . .

John, don't look hurt ! you would not
dream that I am careless of your love if you
could see me now. I have perused your letter
twenty times : I have no fault to find with it.
But, dear, it does not stir my depths as your
long silence stirred them. Mine be the blame
of this ! But you must know the case : then
you shall write or not write as you will. I
love you with my whole heart, I am not sure
that I love you with one lobe of my brain. I
would let my heart, set free, win the conversion
of my mind.

VOL. II. 29

Enough: my reasoning is all abroad. Only,
once more, don't try to utter fancies : I credit
you with the unutterable always. Just tell
me common facts, if needs be, dates and hours.
What you are to me, have you any notion?
I have no words to tell it you ; but, whatever
it is, it is my heart has made you this for me.
Yet what you did not make, you somehow
still might mar. Can you understand this %
It is simple.

I must try and frame it rationally to your
knowledge. A certain outside self of me is
more the slave of things usual than I thought.
I have speeches made to me all day by one
and the other, with which I do not want to
put your speech into comparison.

It would be like your coming up to London
without a high hat : I don't know why, but it
would : remember you were a shock to me
then ! I have not quite got over it yet !

Be my compass, my mainspring, my prince,
my life, my god ! But, for your own sake,
lift me up to you, do not come down  such a
descent it is !  to me.

There ! I am ill to-night. Surely it must
be illness that makes a woman dispraise herself.
Shall I diagnose my illness for you as
you do for me that most vexatious one of
yours ? I have discussed it with Mrs. Lupton,
and she says it is ambition. For my part I
call it fatigue. She says I want an embassy,
I say I want rest.

Oh ! is the secret to be solved by double
life ? I wonder.

To be happy I desire power, but I desire a
slavery therewith : I have the longing to rule
a kingdom, but be ruled by you. Perhaps
sex is my trouble ; if I were a man I could
lead two lives ; and why not now ? Why try
to run a complex personality in a single
groove ?

Don't think I hesitate or balance any
choice whatever in my mind. I don't : I
have chosen you ; I have foregone success, so
called. And yet, so far as this success maybe
compatible with your possession of me, I
want you to let me taste it. Let me know
the worthlessness of the sphere that I resign

before I resign it in your favour. A concession
like this will be generous.

Very often it seems to me, Join, that I
love you as a man loves a woman. I adore
your beauty, I hold my breath before your
gentleness. I know no sweetness upon earth
like the sweetness of your kiss. But your
protection  do I want that ? Oh ! no a thousand
times ; it only makes me smile. You say
that you will shield me ; but then I have no
wish to be shielded 

. . .in me si move
Un anima selvaggia.'

You have not forgotten your Italian ? 
selvaggia,' yes ! that's it. I am Waldine,
to change the sense a little. I ask for choice,
to choose you always in the end, but to be
forced to decide. How else is there action in
life, how else is there worth in love ? Dear,
don't talk of protecting me  a gun can do as
much ; don't talk of providing for me  a fool
can do more ! Draw out my tears with your
tenderness, draw out my soul with your voice.
That is your province. As to the world and

the world's value, I need no help, no added
courage, to make me face the one or despise
the other.

A thousand pardons ! I ask your pardon
always, I know not why. But one thing in
me needs neither forgiveness nor concessions,
the truth I show you. Is not my truth a
merit ? Yet not mine, but yours. For yours
I am, to take or leave, yours for all claims and
all time. And shall I not be true ? ' Oh
yes ! ' you answer, and your tone, unheard,
thrills me although you are so far away :  ' Oh
yes ! it is surely best for both of us that you
should be true ! ' I will.

Was that a sigh of yours, my love, that
closed the whisper and seemed an answer to
my breath of relief ?  for confession is over :
I have nothing more that is hard to tell you,
all is said and done. I do not want to hear
you sigh like that, when I am alone with you,
like this, of evenings.

For indeed, indeed, you are here ! Wherever
I may be now  at home, abroad, in shops
or theatres  I hold you in my heart : you

are my talisman against another care. I
cannot think of any shame or any sorrow
that one instant of your embrace would
not blot out from me for ever. Strange
gift you give me, absolute intoxication of
sense !  and then to attempt speech of it !
No, no, we shall express things sometime, but
not now.

You are ill, you say. How to amuse you ?
Mrs. Lupton or Lady Grenvers could amuse
you better than I. Love makes me sad, exacting,
cross : it is an enervating mist about me. . . .
Ah ! by the way, John, it is strange that the
only two women I should have seen intimately
since I came to England should guide me 
little dreaming it  more and more straight to
you. My aunt is incarnate vanity. Her
influence has been to set me against self. I
am wholly sickened of her care for her beauty
and her dress. She presents what she would
call mere rustic slavery, by contrast, in its
most attractive form. Her introspection (let
me frame it philosophically if I can) moves me
to expansion the more. Because of her prevailing

powder-puff, I pine for sun-tan and
freckles.

Mrs. Lupton's influence lias been more
dangerous than this incitement by opposites :
she has roused my daring. John, I do not
believe in all Mrs. Lupton's adventures, but I
have got to feel it is my mission to prove them
possible. I furnish the examples to her text
of life. It was her fault at first : it will be her
fault still until her fixncy fails her. She is not
more than a dreamer ; but I have lived her
dream. She often says to me, not I now
believe, from her own experience, ' We modern
women must keep life and love apart.' And
then I come straight to you and say to you,
We have fulfilled Mrs. Lupton's ideal in many
ways : let us fulfil it also in this.'

For a time ! For a time only. I ask you
but a breathing space. And, dear, how
charged with sweetness will be the air
we breathe the while ! My wish is this : 
for you are right that I cannot stay a great
while longer away.  Let me return and let
us live our daily life, glorifying ever what

moments of it you will, by meetings at your
pleasure.

While I am here I am amused  I confess
it ; there would be almost cause for you to be
jealous if you saw my surroundings. But
at Whiteknyghts ! you will not grudge me my
unharmed moments there. There is no one 
scarcely any one, is there ?  that will come as far
as Whiteknyghts to find me, of all my London
friends. I will test them at any rate. ' If they
should come?'  you say. Oh! but they won't.

I had a hundred things to say to you, but
they are too trifling. All that matters really
in what I have written is the news that I am
coming. Early, very early in this young year,
I am coming, to find the one real passion the
world holds for me.

Answer me in a word, you perfect lover !
Shall I not come ? shall it not all be as I will ?
I sail upon the clouds in expectation : do not
make me feel myself only ballooning by the
suggestion of any chain to earth however silken.
Raise your spirits to my level ! Meet me up
here in heaven ! . . .



A shiver brings me back to earth  a shiver
like an omen of evil. The fire is out. My
ecstasy seems to have passed. I am,  once
again,  your poor, perplexed

Waldine.

AN AFFIRMATION

Whiteknyghts Cot, January Hath.

Come then, my dearest, when you will, and
let us lead what life you choose together.
Half together, if not yet wholly ; but not
apart, as now, again.

My last qualm is against letting any words
bind you. For you would always speak the more
generous resolve. I will let only your action
bind you past recall. If you come to me now,
you come as my promised wife. Whether our
Averting day be in summer or winter does not
seem to me to matter. You know what you do.

But, once returned here, whether your home
be at this side of the world or at the other,
you are mine : there is to be no going back.

I was to give you facts. My father is ill.
He has had an accident : and my mother is
worn out with watching him. Think of me as
better, watching too. But it is only half my
sight that watches the old man's sleep ; and
the more wakeful half watches the road for
you.

My child, my mistress 1 it costs me something
to leave the paper blank. And yet I
know how poor my words must seem to you.
Look into my heart : I'll warrant you will not
be disappointed there.

John Lyne

LITTLE FOXES

I HAVE not,' said Mrs. Lupton, summing upas
was her wont, an article of her negative
creed for Waldine's behoof, ' any opinion at
all of my own sex.'

It was an interval in the busy London day,
that opportune moment preceding tea (and the
inevitable tea-side danglers) which she was fond
of improving before she launched into her airy
cynicism. It was a moment full of memories
for Val ; it was for just this hour she had
walked with John Lyne on Constitution Hill.

*Your mood is Delphic,' she answered
absently, ' and that gray velvet gown is
tomh-y, as Aunt Linda would say. Utter, my
oracle, and tell me why ?'

She sat herself at Mrs. Linton's feet ; she
experienced always now a longing for caresses.
She put her head on Mrs. Lupton's knee, Mrs.
Lupton stroked it with her small nervous
hand which felt the softness of the hair
without divining a throb of the brain.

Of you, my dear, I have a sort of notion,
but the most of us are quite elusive ; one
must mistrust us, because trust has no foundation.
Oh ! L don't mean that I have a bad
opinion of women. I mean just what I say 
I have none  we are such a menagerie.
Worldly women are like turkeys and tortoises.
If you don't strut and gobble, and fatten your
body and wrinkle your face, you must get a
shell and creep about beneath it. Ethelinda
has become a tortoise already ; her shell is
self, and how she polishes that shell ! I shall
be a turkey, Yal, I know it. I have shuddered
at Christmas fare like a cannibal, and I suppose
that's the reason. Oh ! the want of courage
that sends us all to the same farmyard or
floor. We who thought once to fly, in the
end we waddle or crawl.'

I suppose I shall finish as one or the
other,' said Val laughing, ' tortoise or turkey,
shall I crawl or gobble?  But I always
thought Aunt Linda was a butterfly.'

It is the butterfly, dear, that swells and
hardens into the tortoise ; I have watched it
often. For myself I have prayed to be neither
tortoise nor turkey, yet I often feel the
clutter in my throat and I know my doom.
But widowhood helps me,' she concluded with
a sigh :  'Be a widow, Val ! It is difficult, but
I don't see why it should be impossible to
forecast it, if you choose your man.'

'Think of some other mode of emancipation,'
said Waldine slowly, repressing an odd
shiver :  ' I want an original life.'

A life,' Mrs. Lupton echoed ; ' we always
say "a life," as if it were a certain line of
tram or railway. Yet Chance is still standing
by us with hands full of varied hours :
the thing is to get a safe foothold within
reach of them. I have made my perch ; it is
not lofty, but it is easy; thence I select
samples of existence.'

Samples would not suffice me ; I am more
robust than you. I want to lose myself.'

 Inartistic ; in fact coarse ! I am convinced
of the need for a safe critical standpoint.
There shall Chance toss you the
hours : play with them what game you will
and let them fall, but keep your foothold.
By the way, Waldine, you must marry soon.'

Indeed, ma'am, and why V

For a reason the reverse of the common ;
most women marry for protection, you must
marry to protect. Your husband must be perpetually
drawing out your masculine qualities,
and you will find the feminine virtues increase
with the demand.'

That's obscure ; but if I understand you,
I think you are right about me.'

What a grave tone ! . . . Mr. Denham ?
Ah ! you have precluded a confession ! I was
going to put some home-questions to Waldine :
and she would have responded . . . who can
prophesy how ? Likely enough, in Chinese
fashion, by more questions ! So that it's as
well you came. But answer, is the fog really

thick enough to warrant your being admitted
again to-day?'

It is black out of doors said Mr. Denham
sheepishly, ' I took for granted that it was fog.'

Waldine had not risen ; she was still gazing
steadily into the fire. He came across to
shake hands with Mrs. Lupton and then
stooped over her ; she took his hand, but it
was only to raise herself from the floor.
When she had done that, she walked away a
step or two, regardless of his having pressed
her fingers. She did not even say 'thank
you ' for his assistance.

Mr. Denham looked at her ; she wore a
simple gown of a sort of soft dark fleece ;
her head showed above it like a flower out of
brown mould. Her face had the sort of
vividness that pales paint. Coming in from
the cold air, she had flushed her cheeks with
rice-flour a little, and a few grains of it rested
upon the ivory and rose of her beauty like an
earthy stain. The texture and tint of her
skin were alike so lovely that the least
artificial touch disfigured them. She was

standing near a lamp, the light from which,
diffused through a white paper shade, was full
upon her hands as she tied and untied a long
brown ribbon knotted in a loose bow upon her
bosom. Her hands were like lilies.

Mr. Denham looked at her. She was to
him an enchantment, a mystery, a goddess.
Mrs. Lupton looked at Mr. Denham and
smiled ; he was not even a riddle to her.

You have no news,' she said in rather a
meaning voice.

No,' he answered, * you always know everything
first. I've nothing to tell you.'

His tone, which he made purposely impressive,
attracted Waldine's attention.

 How comes it you remain in town ? ' she
asked him ; ' I thought you were devoted to
hunting.'

Oh ! I like London too,' he answered,
awkward and crimson ; ' I shall stay up sometime.'


'Shall you?' she said; 'I confess I don't
care for it any more. I would say so to no
hostess but Mrs. Lupton ; she permits whims :
VOL. II. 30

and if I don't like it under her auspices I
should like it less under my aunt's. I have a
caprice for isolation, my palate is cloyed with
pleasure.'

Yes, there is too much pleasure,' said the
Hon. Launcelot sadly, 'but I should have
thought you found Whiteknyghts dull.'

I adore dulness,' said Waldine  ' dulness,
cold, loneliness : I want the tonics of these.
I feel like a Skye terrier that has been kennelled
in a hothouse.'

But surely Whiteknyghts is like a hothouse
quite as much V

I suppose it is not perfect,' she answered
impatiently, ' but attending perfection  that's
a French phrase I fear  it pleases me well
enough.'

You like that part of the world ? '

Sufficiently well '  she stopped short and
put one of her white hands to her head.
There had darted through her mind like a
swift pain the vision of that adorable wild
land about Whiteknyghts which was covert to
the only quest she sought.

You would not hate to make it your
home?' His tone was a little anxious now.

It is my home : you are like Magnate's
questions, only not so well worded. . . . Look
at Mrs. Lupton's visitors, they are more
amusing than I am.  Who is that V

It is Lady Trefusis ; is she not handsome %

Eugenia Trefusis ! the one woman Mrs.
Lupton loves. Let us sit down here and you
shall tell me about her.'

All the world knows : ' She is as good as
she is beautiful," et cetera. None the less I
believe she was once passionately in love with,
a brute called Jarvis. Mrs. Lupton knows
him too.'

That dreadful Captain Jarvis who rides in
the row with Mrs. North V

The same ; the man who married Miss
Buxton.'

I think I can understand the infatuation.'

You ?'

I. Don't look so horrified ; I do not
know him, and I have only seen her in the
distance. I may be wrong ; but I realise the

position. Captain Jarvis was the unknown
for Miss Brand ; she lead no landmarks. Had
she been less angelic she would have been
much harder to deceive.  Does she ever see
him now ? '

Never. She has set up the landmarks
with a vengeance since.'

That also I can understand. What a face
she has ! she makes Mrs. Lupton look like a
wicked doll. 1 suppose everybody in London
has a history.'

Everybody one knows, I should think.
Why that serious look? Do you want a
history ? '

I don't know what I want : I want to
stand bareheaded in the rain  that first.'

It's the heat of the room.  Miss de Stair,
will you let me tell you what it is you want ?
I am the sort of fellow that is very little good
at words, and one does not make speeches
nowadays, you see ; but I think what you
long for is to have your own way in everything,
and what I wish is that you would let
me help you to have it.'

I don't know that you are right, and I
don't see how you can help me

'Don't you?' he Laughed nervously, changing
colour a little, under her steady stare, but
man enough all the while not to flinch from his
position.  ' You might at least let me try. It
is like this. As things are, you have nothing
to gain by anything you may do. But if you
were  different, in different circumstances 
everything you did would matter, and not to
yourself alone.'

*We none of us live to ourselves alone,'
said Waldine with mock solemnity :  ' Have
you any notion how ridiculous you look
lecturing me ? Your face is quite red and the
collar of your coat is on end with excitement.
I never knew men's clothes were sympathetic 
wool to the sheep.'

You are not kind,' said the young man,
dum foundered at her rudeness :  ' But have
you any notion how beautiful you look when
you laugh ? yes, and when you frown too ? I
wish I had your photograph like that.'

Photographs are vulgar things. Mrs.

Lupton and I had a perfect holocaust yesterday
; we burnt you in effigy I can't tell you
how often ; it's a marvel that you have survived
it. You will have to present her with at least
a dozen new-ones to fill the empty frames.'

I have had some new ones taken ; may I
give you one ? if so Mrs. Lupton may have
the rest.'

I suppose you may ; but I shall not
frame it.'

You will not burn it ? '

No, I will take the greatest care of it : I
will put it away in a box, lock the box and
throw away the key.'

Well, as you will. What sort of copy shall
I send you ? they're wonderful fancy affairs,
my new photographs ; plain or embossed ? '

I should think the plain ones would bethe
most like you,' said Waldine carelessly :
and then they both laughed, like children, and
he could not press his suit.

But having silenced him, she returned,
womanlike, to the dangerous ground.

This repartee was but an interlude,' she

said, leaning back in lier chair ; * you were
teaching me my London. Lesson the first, to
disbelieve everything ; I cannot skip so soon
to lesson the last, to believe in you. Tell me ;
it does not trouble you that people have had
histories V

I should have very little sleep at nights if
it did.'

And you sleep well after the " fitful fever "
of your days ? '

Like a dog ; nobody's scrapes bore me ;
even my own don't keep me awake.'

Have you had " a history ? " '

He blushed. ' No  yes ! I suppose so,* a
hundred  nothing considerable.'

Novelettes at most, or shall we say paragraphs
? '

Oh ! I'm not worth discussion ; and 1
believe in fresh starts up to a certain age.'

For a woman also ? May I have novelettes
and paragraphs ? '

You are like nobody else. How am I to
tell you what I think about women ? They
must be very young to start quite fresh . . .

but what do you know ? And I  Miss de Stair,
the feminine world divides itself for me into
* you," and " other women." '

That is a very pretty speech, I suppose ;
I am vain enough to take it so.'

It is meant to be. You see for sine you
can't do wrong. Even when you are hard on
me it seems all right. There is nothing I could
not forgive you, nothing I could not excuse
you. . . . Because I want you so. Oh ! won't
you let me tell you how much I want you ? '

His voice had become quite thick with
emotion ; its low, deep tone, because it did
not melt her in the least, froze Waldine's confidence
 she was half frightened, half amused.

Don't go on talking now,' she said, pushing
her chair aside a little :   Open the door
for Lady Trefusis and bring me some toast.'

The wonder in her heart was answered !
She could envisage choice. From what worse
evil should one pray to be delivered ?

THE WORLD WELL LOST

And it was with the knowledge that she left
a lover, still undeclared, in London, that
Waldine de Stair returned to Whiteknyghts
soon afterwards. Returned to havoc, sorrow,
pain  to the undisguised seams of life. Returned
gladly : she was independent of them
all.

Her latter days in town had been days of
almost unmixed pleasure, but she had not
enjoyed them at the time. Her heart's blood
had absorbed the poison of London variety
and London insincerity without her knowledge,
but the poison left no immediate trace upon
her will. Because still superbly potent above
it was the desire of love.

She came back to the country like a freed
prisoner : her young step bounded up the
broad, still staircase, whispered, rather than
echoed, along the warmed corridors, was
music to Lord Grenvers, and to her ladyship
not seldom perplexity and fear.

Don't bounce into the room, darling she
said at last, when surprised in too flagrant
self contemplation with the familiar hand-glass :
Never houiice or steal. My way of entering
the room has been so much to my poor saint
for years. It's not that I don't want you
always, but my nerves are so sensitive. I
really should have thought your long visit to
Charlotte would have taught you . . . poor
Charlotte ! I never dared enter her room
without knocking, or even go round the corner
without a cough ; but she was younger then !
I suppose noir. . . . And that was different !
By the way, I have never seen a woman let her
complexion go as Charlotte has done  not that
it ever was much  still jea-souj:, really jjea-
soup. My face is a disease to what it was 
yes ! Val, a disease  but it is human flesh.'

There are other things in the world beside
complexions,' said Waldine ; but her ladyship
did not attend ; she was mounted on her
favourite hobby of self and self's demands.

 What was that tiresome game one used to
play?' she went on in a slow, sad voice,
absently taking up the hand-glass again.
" Animal, vegetable, or mineral,"  that was it.
Some women look vegetable or mineral  now
I am animal still.'

You are ethereal,' said the girl laughing.
Lady Grenvers heard that ; her ears contained
some special valve for compliments, which was
always open. They entered in and dwelt
there.

You spoil me, Val,' she said, ' but everyone
has always spoiled me ! No, dear, I am
animal,  a poor worm of course, but not a
potato or a lump of lead ; you are animal too,
Val ; your complexion is almost too  too,
what is it 1  violent. I hope you won't get
apoplectic by and by.'

I hope not,' said AValdine  ' yes. Aunt
Linda, I suppose I am. Animal ? Human ?

Well ! who would really care to be a stone ora
soul ? '

Horrid ! ' said her ladyship, putting a
period to the discussion with her usual
comment as soon as she was out of her
depth.

Were they stones or souls  Waldine
wondered  the people about her \ or were
they just half-people or were they dead ? She
went to the window and looked out from its
one unsullied square  a white world, with
black, snow-fraught sky above it ; somewhere
he was waiting for her now. Was it cold ?
was that the whimper of the wind across the
park ? she did not care.

I think I shall go out for a run,' she said
at last, her tentative tone anticipating a
rebuke. * " The snow lies white," but we maybe
quite snowed in tomorrow.'

Ah ! what a pretty song that was. / used
to sing it. " The snow lies white." ' Lady
Grenvers hummed it to herself over the hand-glass,
which reflected to her that the powder
lay white ' also.

Waldine waved her a kiss and left her.
She preferred the snow for choice.

There was a sort of fire alight in the girl's
senses. The icy airs crept round her in vain ;
the frost only dared the blood to her feet and
hands ; nothing chilled her. Nor was it only
love that warmed her through. She was in
supreme and ardent health ; her restful life of
luxury made her impervious to fatigue or
weather. She was more hardy than her lot
in society demanded ; she had a reserve of
energy and warmth. Why waste it here ?

She fastened some furs round her neck and
put on a velvet hat ; then she glided out of
the door and breathed the fresh wind, crystal
clear, across the waste land and the snow. It
was a fairy scene. To her, so newly steeped
in London fog and gaslight, the purity of this
rare atmosphere, the visible descent of gradual
night were boons that brought intensity of
feeling and succinctness of resolve. As she
stepped quickly over the iron fields, crunching
the drift like salt, her thoughts were travelling
wind-swift in her brain.

Is that the world ? ' she said aloud, ' for
which so many people dare and bear so much 1
I have heard Aunt Linda quite envied : there
has never been any scandal about her ; women
would give their lives to have her wealth, her
reputation, and her husband's love : and yet
the centre of her being, where does one find it ?
In that little ivory knob by which she holds
her powder-puff ! It is there.'  She laughed,
but not unkindly, and kicked the snow as if
it were the orris root and violet meal she
scorned.

' And Mrs. Lupton's world ! it is quite as
trivial really  her life is a twirling toy ; she
can stop it and no one will mind ; she can
change it and only rest people's attention. It
does not do. Does anything do on earth, I
wonder, that has no claims and brings no
suffering ? I had rather have my uncle's life
than hers.'

Her thought saddened as it traversed Lord
Grenvers' sphere ; she walked more slowly
and in silence ; after a moment she smiled.
She was thinking of Mr. Launcelot Denham.

Simply by contrast ! Illness connotes health
and suffering: strength. It was no treasonable
thought ; he meant to have the good things of
the world ; he meant to make a life. So far
very well. But he had made his world spin
and his life hano on her will and from her
finger. And for her, his world with every
other world, his life with every other life,
were so well lost for love.

Love, incarnate and her own, that was
waiting for her under the bare ash-tree boughs !
She had met John every day since her return ;
she had been building busily at that imaginary
dwelling-place wherein their twin souls were
some time to dwell. And here the tree was,
full in sight, and he had not failed her yet.

Her glance was too impassioned now, and
too possessive, to note that lie was changed.
Not less handsome, not less radiant, taller he
looked indeed,  but he had lost flesh, and the
brightness of his eyes burned over hollower 
cheeks ; the voice in which he greeted her was
deeper than of old, had husked its ringing
tone, more muffled day by day.

All ! ' he said, ' you have come at hist.
Kiss me once, twice ; Warlike, I have heavy
news.'

Do not tell it me yet ! Let me be a little
glad of your presence first.'

To be with him was an enchantment to
her, to be in his arms an ecstasy ; she launched
herself upon the tide of love like a boat on
summer waves. For him too her kiss was an
intoxication, an oblivion. . . . They made
June in winter.

What is your bad news ? ' she asked him
at length, smiling up into his face.

He sighed. ' Nothing hurts you that I
can tell you, does it ? ' he said with tender
care.

Nothing ; my only suffering is when I am
absent from you ; then it aches here like
hunger.' She put his strong bare hand upon
her heart. Its beating sent the colour to his
cheeks and lips  the beating of the heart that
made his joy.

Oh ! ' he said softly, ' do not make me too
happy to-day. Waldine, my father is dead.'

The words had little meaning for her ; she had
never known his father ; she had not allowed
herself to think ever about his parents except
as people that must die some day  unwelcome
figures that would yield the stage at last.

She pressed him closer in her arms, with a
sweet gravity of look that soothed him like
music. She took him away from life and, in
the new world that she made for him, she
asked him the very truth.

'It is soon,' she said  'sudden rather.
John, are you very sad  very sorry ? Should
you not have minded this much more a yeas'
ago? Tell me "yes!'

('A year ago!' How could he remember
what he would have minded then ?)

'There is no blank you cannot fill forme
by one dear word,' he answered. 'But
each sad circumstance, each loss that comes tome,
will be a wound until you heal it.'

Tell me about his death,' said Waldine
quickly, with evasive eyes. She looked across
his shoulder, she saw the long cold stretch
toward his home : she sighed.

VOL. II. 31

It is good of you to look sad lie said, ' it
is good of you to sigh. No ! why should I
tell you ? He died this morning, without any
pain, from some brain injury he got in the
fall. He was an old man, sweetheart ; you
are right : I will not be sorry. But I am
troubled about my mother : can you guess
what the loss of him is to her V

I think so. If I thought I should be any
good, I would come with you to see her. 
Perhaps you wished it ? Yes ;  but not just
yet. I cannot act ; and I have no personal
affection for her. Your people were not dear
to me because of you, as they would have
been to some women. They were only people
who had a certain claim upon your love and
upon your time. I have resented them
always.'

You are so strange, Waldine ; sometimes
 I think you are made of marble and sometimes
of fire.'

Common hard stone, call it, for the rest :
mere flame for you  you are not so wholly
wrong. Dearest, be rational ! I see precisely

how things stand. You have thought to
yourself:  "Why, here is her moment ! She
will come and throw herself upon my mother's
neck and be a daughter to her from henceforward."
But that is just what I could never
do. If I went with you now I should either
patronise her or alarm her. Let her consolation
be that you are still hers for a time. 
Ah ! not for long.'

'But by and by?'  said John, doubtful
though half convinced against his will.

By and by she will die too, ' said the girl
impatiently, ' she is not immortal. Oh ! love,
don't look so shocked : don't say I give you
more sorrow ! But can't you see that your
mother and I should not agree under one roof ?
Can't you see, John, that your isolation is the
one thing that makes you possible ? You
have kept yourself apart from the rest to some
good end, but you must be isolated wholly.
I shall give up my world for you, but you
must give up yours for me. And death ends
ties so gently and so well. Oh ! I believe in
death. See ! it is not a doom apart : we

must all die to make way for progress. Is
not that philosophy?'

It may be so : 'tis a new view of death
for me

'* There are no fields of amaranth on this
side the grave," ' she said, ' '' there is no name,
with whatsoever emphasis of passionate love
repeated, of which the echo is not faint at
last." That is Landor's : if I could speak such
honey, it is that I would have said. You
must lose me sometime, or. I must lose you :
or if we kill ourselves together the rest of the
world must lose us. Some day we must lose
each other ! It is written. Not to miss our
happiness while we have it in hand : that is
what matters. Beloved, I resist no longer.
The resolve your news brings me is that I will
marry you tomorrow if you will. I accept
your father s death, not for hindrance but for
spur. Anybody will look after your mother
till she dies!'

But, AValdine,' said John, in utter distraction
of mind, ' what is this that you say ?
Do you not realise how this great loss of hers

must bind me  us  to my mother? How
can I  we  leave her soon 1 how can we
leave her ever ? You are so  is it un-english
? it cannot be heartless. How shall
I teach you life V

You teach me life !' she cried. 'Poor John,
it is not life you have to teach me : it is love
love, as you read it, which indeed I half
approve. I think you love me well, I believe
you will love me for ever. But life ! leave
life to me. You asked me to emigrate : had
I gone with you and your father died afterwards,
as he must have done, we should not
have returned. I would not go : I wished
things to arrange themselves, links to fall off
and leave our freedom clear : now the first
link has fallen. Let us congratulate ourselves
that we did nothing to force it.'

What do you mean ? '

Is impatience then a sealed book to you ? 
Can you not understand the longing to be
free goading one into striking off obstacles, v.
scattering them to right and left. On my life,
I think such a struggle would fill one's days

far better than laments and lassitude. You
look so struck with fear that I am possessed
with a desire to tell you all my worst. John, I
believe I have no heart except to live by : I
know but one sort of love. Don't you think
I would pitch Uncle Grenvers out of window
bath-chair and all  and put arsenic into
my aunt's lip-salve, sooner thar let them part
me from you?'

He smiled at her plain words. ' You area
tigress, my beauty,' he said with reflected
passion, as he strained her in his arms, the
wild blood wakened in him with her laughter.
But it was not the rose-leaf kiss of old :

Come with me now ! ' he murmured.

'Let me go,' she said, still laughing, ' remember
this is your afternoon for sackcloth and ashes,
though it may be also my hour for secret joy.
But I want no secrets from you. John, I
am glad of your father's death, and you must
get over it without my help. Look how dark
it is and feel how cold ! ' she put her cheek
against his hand.

Yes, it is cold,' lie answered, as he loosed

her :  ' Well, what are we to do ? Love, I amin
your hands : I stop the clock of my old
conscience here. At first I shall be a bad echo
to your leaps of time ; but teach me plain
what flights to take.'

I want no flights at present : here we
stand under our own twin tree  my tree : the
one bit of landed property which I possess !
We have youth, health, love  perfect trust.
And I have courage. . . . But it is an odd
sort of courage : it goes from me when you are
not by. There are times when I feel subject
to any moment's magnetism and capable of any
crime : other times there are when I become
an innocent and happy self. Have you no
experience of such changes ? '

I don't think much about them,' said
John humbly, ' I am too simple for you yet :
but I do think, Waldine, that half of your
complexity is youth. You play ball with life
and death because your nerves are not yet
sensible of weight. I shall make you so tame,
my darling, by and by.'

*That will be better than my worsening

you !  Oh wc have talked into hours, and you
are going back to a sad home ! Have I no
compassion ? I ought to be so sorry. Love,
I want to see you again to-night : these stars
do not shine for nothing. And such a moon,
Endymion ! Ah ! she is in love with you, that
foolish moon, to shine upon your face like that.'
She took off his cap, and with her arms clasped
round his neck, she gazed at his beauty, her
whole soul, her whole being, aflame within her
turning eyes.

I will come,' said John, ' if you want to seeme
: I will walk up at nine o'clock this evening,
and stand by the window of your music-room
like last night ! like last night.'

Ah 1 then I am content : I could not say
good-bye. Love, what is that shadow moving
down the road ? '

It is a man on horseback coming from the
Court : it looks like Mr. Denham.'

Impossible : he is in London still. I told
you  did I not ?  that he is in love with
me ?'

I knew it. You did not tell me.'

What a tone ! So lie is best there, is he
not ? we do not want him here ? '

Oh Waldine, do not name him ! should I
ever name another girl to you ? Ah ! well, I
will be silent if you will keep your hand upon
my lips like that. Must you go, sweet, must
you go ? I feel you flutter like a bird within
my arms.'

Now or never. Whisper : you do not
mind about your father any more ? you love
me best ? No words : a whisper is too loud :
I hear it in your heart.  Itt  tell me once ! '

He bent his head over her cheek, his month
to her lovely ear, till her temples flamed at his
breath. . . . Who dares give his words ? He
only knows them who has in such a way, at
such an hour, let loose the floodgates of his
pent-up soul.

Heart of a woman, filled with that full tide,
what in your life is made of the passionate
river ? Only a draught to quench your instant
thirst : only refreshment for bright lips and
luring eyes that afterward shall smile and
shine upon other waters.

WALDINE WHITES

Whiteknyghts, Fehruanj th.

Elsie mine, long neglected : lost and found
again, as one loses and finds one's friends, in
the maze of memory, low shall I excuse myself
for your many letters not answered at all, your
many other letters answered by a hurried line ?
Best, I think, by telling you all my news in
this, such as it is to tell.

Kemember, dear, I am a rustic now. Do
not expect surprises : and keep yourself prepared
for a tone of sadness. I have done with
cities : I want to be a rustic all my life.

This afternoon I have built myself away
from the world : locked doors, closed curtains,
barred shutters : I am going to piece together

my existence for you, to pick up the threads
of my loom. And first you want the figures
of the scene.

You will have heard that my uncle is ill :
his plight is such that at the time you first
heard it probably he was better again : and
by the time you heard he was better he was
certainly worse. I caught Aunt Ethelinda the
other day discussing widow's weeds with him :
what a true disappointment she will feel that
he can never see if they become her ! He
makes all sorts of preparations for his death :
and sets his house in order as a good man
should. I am with him a great deal oftener
than I was at first. My love of the place,
which has grown into a passion, pleases him
more day by day. He understands that my
aunt will never care to live here without him.
I doubt if she knows the landmarks round the
first turn in the road or the look from any
point of view but her boudoir window : I
suppose, after the event she will travel and
become the cynosure of continental hotels. I
often wish that you could hear her ciescendo,

with its gradual changes of tone. It commences
sadly :

'When my poor saint is gone she says,
'gone over to the majority," Val, as the
Greeks used to say  I am half a Greek myself
since those tableaux  Ah ! ivliat is to become
of poor Queen Venus ? Everything goes to a
cousin or something horrid I have never cared
to knoAv : the title is extinct and shoals of
females will divide the spoil, so fat and hideous
they can only marry into the learned professions
Chabot ! . . . He leaves me what he can, I
believe, but what is money to a widow ? My
one comfort is that I shall never be a dowager :
though with a name like mine  made for a
dowager  to evade being " Ethelinda, Lady
Grenvers," is after all not utterly consoling.' 
And then, with rather a more cheerful accent :
' When my poor saint is gone, dear Val, I
shall have to travel. Awful, of course, for
I am such a stay-at-home ; but I can't help
feeling that it will be my only chance. Where
shall I go % some dull place first, I suppose :
Venice. But what is the good of crape at

Venice ? It does not matter what one wears
there : I shall go about in a hat, and lace in the
evening. . . . Have you never been to Venice,
Val ? You shall come with me ! I imagine
it will be next autumn. At first we shall
have to be very quiet, but one may get quite
a rest and change there before  well ! it will
depend on circumstances whether one can go
out or not next season. What do you think ? '
And then she lapses into silence, while the
periods of sorrow are reckoned !

And yet, dear Elsie, when the time is come, I
know she will be inconsolable ; but in the meanwhile
she diverts herself with attention divided
between schemes of mourning and oi trousseaux,
for she has set her heart upon my marriage.

You have guessed to whom ? It is one of
those things that seem fated : ever since I
came here it has been obvious to the meanest
intelligence that sooner or later I must marry
Launcelot Denham. And the worst of it is
that it seems as obvious to him !

Realise my entourage ! an aunt whose folly
is more magnetic and decisive than another

woman's reason ; an uncle of superior gifts
who approves lier judgment in all things;
a lover  well ! one would not wish a fonder
or more earnest lover than the devoted Launce.
Why, the sequel of the story is not worth
writing ! It is a question of date. Give reins
to your conception of eligibility  yes ! and
you may give scope to your fancy too  the
real man would not disappoint you. On the
face of things it would be impossible to refuse
Mr. Denham. Oh ! whither will life lead me ?
I was born to be hanged.

Flippant you say. Remember flippancy
with me was always an excuse from tears. But
I don't want to discuss my failings with you ;
I want to give you statements ; then you shall
mount your tripod and deliver the prophetic roll.
You can predict of me with some experience.

I went to London with Mrs. Lupton ; Mr.
Denham was there. Hardly a day passed
but we met ; and wherever we might chance
to be, he made it plain that there was no
one there for him but me. Not unpleasant ;
there were no exactions ; I bade him farewell

a free woman, as I am to this day. I returned
to Whiteknyghts only glad to leave him in
town. He was to remain there some time
longer. But he did not do so. Listen.

You know  I do not want to write upon
this subject  that I have had a toquade for
'the bailiff' here. Do not misinterpret the cool
tone of this statement ; it is just in this way
that I try to formulate the position to myself.
Whether I have felt superficially or deeply,
whether I have been wise or foolish, these
points are incidental, they do not alter the
fact. I saw 'the bailiff' in London; up to
that meeting he had seemed to me a sort of
god ; since then he has seemed to me only a
rather inexperienced young man. But in my
personal regard  is that the term ?  for him
this made no sort of difference. When I came
back here I was honestly glad to see him
again  glad with my whole heart. If I could
entirely divorce him from surroundings I
should be glad to see him all the days of my
life. But his surroundings have fatigued me
of late. He has lost his father, and his mother

frets herself eastwards as fast as she can.
You, who know me, know how trivial and
commonplace these domestic affections and
afflictions seem to me. It is not so with John
Lyne ; he is absorbed in anxiety and grief.
Moreover he has suffered much in health ; he
has become what I used most to hate  ' an ill
man ;' but I do not hate him yet. One does not
hate, ever, the man that has first brought the
light into one's life. . . . And with his illness,
his anxiety, his grief, he somehow has increased
his demands ; he is not content to be my playfellow.
The situation is serious : what am I
to do ? Now that I write it in this brutal
way it has an ugly look. I must elucidate.

Elsie, attend to this ! One afternoon last
week I met ' the bailiff not by accident, and,
I suppose, gave him  let us figure it thus  a
presumptive right to be jealous. When we
parted I added  shall we call it an order ? 
to come up to Whiteknyghts in the evening.
There intervened an unfortunate moment, for
which the temerity of my town admirer is
responsible. Here's the account.

WALDINE WRITES 209

Returning home, I met Mr. Denham, leading
his horse ! John's eyes had been quicker
than mine ; he had spied him coming from
the Court, where he had been to inquire
for my uncle, who chanced to be better
that afternoon. He had said to me, * There
is Mr. Denham ! ' I had answered, as we
stood together there beneath our ash-tree,
that it was impossible : * He is in London
still,' I had told him, and I believed I
spoke the truth. Mr. Denham, riding from
the Court, had tried a short cut which the
snow disguised ; his horse had stumbled over
some pitfall of the waste land, and was badly
lamed. Recall that I was happy and at peace
with all the world ; recall that Mr. Denham
was glad of the accident which had so far
hindered his return as to let him have a chance
of seeing me. Understand that we were not
far from the Whiteknyghts stable and a very
long distance from Denham. You will conclude
that, almost of necessity, I asked him
back to the Court. For you would have done
so yourself, light-hearted.

VOL. II. 32

He was unafFectedly concerned, at first,
about his horse ; I had no danger signals.
We walked along side by side, and I was
thinking of 'the bailiff.' I forget, Elsie, when
I first perceived that Mr. Denham was talking
at all ! I do remember that he said I did not
look cold. And I laughed because, for some
unknown reason, I was feeling at that instant
much like a live torch. There is a warmth
which has not to do with weather.

He went with his horse to the stable ; I
betook myself to his lordship's room, and interested
him as far as I could in the Hon.
Launce's misadventure. Ill chanced that access
of zeal :  ' I should like to see him,' said
my uncle.

He had been denied admission before, because
it is a rule of the house : indeed he had
only left his card ; but now that he was with
us, my aunt descended to see him. She was
enraptured with her own appearance, and consequently
cordial  his visit happened to cheer
the invalid. In fine, his horse being installed,
the trap that was to have taken him back to

Denham was counter-ordered, and he remained
to dinner.

Hardly, Elsie, can you conceive the change
it made in our dull routine, this impromptu
invitation. Lord Grenvers was wheeled into
the dining-room, and her ladyship and I made
those fancy - dress toilettes one makes in
England when one says, ' We will not dress
this evening.' Mr. Denham put on an elaborate
array of my uncle's while his wet clothes
were dried. And whether it was from the
novelty of the costume or from the rarity of
the circumstances, he became interesting. Of
course we had many London topics in common,
he and I : no doubt it was because of that.
But I have left off trying to find out a reason
for anything. Facts  facts only !

We dine at a punctual eight, and the meal is
not a long one. At a quarter past nine his lordship
was taken back to his own rooms, suffering
slight premonitory symptoms of neuralgic pain.
My aunt, in her familiar rule of the ' Angel in
the House,' floated out by the side of his chair,
and waved a momentary ' dj tantdtJ

I will be back directly,' she said ; ' if you
will have no more wine, Waldine will take
you to her sanctum : let us have our coffee
there together.'

Elsie, when she had left the room, I felt a
wave of fear pass over me. In the warmth,
the daylight, the fragrance of fruit and flowers,
the sense of hen-etre in the charming room,
the complete immunity from interruption, was
there not every incentive to help this young
man, never over-reticent, to speak his mind ?

He fortified himself with another glass of
claret : not to be formal, I got up and stood
by the fire. ' Ah ! ' he said, ' it was almost
too good to be true that I should see you
sitting opposite to me like that at dinner.'

It was not the first time,' I replied, but
I felt the evasion was a poor one ; it gave him
too good a chance of saying that he hoped it
would not be the last  the sort of repartee to
which he is equal, and of which he availed
himself with empressement .

I know 1 you can stop your ears and shut
your eyes ; blind and deaf you could give our

brilliant dialogue almost word for word. He
was very anxious to be serious, I was quite
determined to be trivial. But when lie asked
point-blank to be let speak to me, half to gain
time and half from inadvertence I told him I
would permit his cigarette in my own sitting-room
: I hoped that my aunt, having consigned
her dear saint to his nurses and powdered
her lovely nose, might be there before us, in
order to arrange the lights for her complexion.
She was not there : she had sent a handmaiden
to shroud the lamps becomingly : the
room looked curiously warm and almost
oriental. I never have the curtains drawn
there, 'pour des raisons ; and the pink and
white candle shades told well against the black
background of window glass. Perhaps the
sight was cosy and pretty to envious eyes
without. But how should Mr. Denham think
of any such contingency ? Nor did I, at the
moment ; I was intent on evading a definite
demand. And this demand I have hitherto
evaded.

It was twenty-five minutes past nine : think

that any one who waited outside my window
since nine o'clock, had waited in the snow for
nearly half an hour ! And then think of
this : 

Mr. Denham had dined well : Mr. Denham
wanted to ask me to be his wife. I had
brought him to a place where there was even
less fear of interruption than in the diningroom,
and, as there, we were alone. Add that
Mr. Denham is not diplomatic, he is engagingly
sincere, and you will not be unprepared
for what occurred. He followed me
closely into the room : we had exhausted
conversation, and although we were not even
looking at each other, to an observer our
intimacy must have seemed assured. I stooped
to fasten the case of my violin, which was
lying on the floor, for fear my aunt's long
train should catch the lid, when she came
down. Mr. Denham seized the opportunity
to see what sort of figure he made in a large
looking-glass, which is over the fireplace.
When I glanced up at the same glass, as I
rose, I was greatly amused by his evident

pleasure at the way my uncle's lounging - suit
became him. I burst out laughing ; I had
quite forgotten I was close to my admirer in
the flesh ; I was only taken up by his image
in the glass. Did he read delight in my
mirth ? In a moment he had caught me in
his arms and I felt the breath of his lips upon
my hair. . . .

No, he did not kiss me. I would have
resisted that to the death. But the worst of
it was that my escape from his salute was not
due to any act of intrepidity on my part, but
simply to the noiseless entrance at this juncture
of Aunt Ethelinda. I did not even have
to move aside, my gallant swain caught the
scent of her approach and loosed me.

Elsie, from outside this is what it seemed : a
sudden embrace interrupted by an unwelcome
relative. And I knew for certain I could not
appeal to my aunt. I saw, from her completely
ignoring the proximity in which she found us,
that her one regret was that she had not delayed
her coming five minutes longer. Even as it was
she was delighted. As for Lancelot, what

had he to be ashamed of ? he wished to astonish
me, to take my bashful sense by storm. He
would have tried it again had the opportunity
occurred. I was not ashamed myself: he is
not trifling with me : he has said quite enough to
teach me that I may accept him at any moment
and in any manner : nor had I behaved ill : I
had been just civil to a man who does not displease
me. That was all. But for the burning
heart outside, in weariness and cold, was there
no shame in this ? Elsie, there was a man before
my window whose soul was ashamed of me.

I did not see him ; I had no chance of
explanation.

I know that he was there : had I not bade
him come ? He turned and went away.

Do you care for the sequel of that evening ?
Lord Grenvers was worse, and Aunt Linda
had come to make a courteous adieu to our
unexpected guest. In a quarter of an hour
he had left us, and she, really anxious for
once, had returned to my uncle.

What did I do ? I opened the window and
stepped out upon the terrace in the snow. 0]i !

once, for one last time, let me strip bare to you
my heart of hearts, and tell you what I did. So
soon the falling fleece would mar those careful
footsteps ! I traced them while I could ; I
followed towards the park. I came to a small
flight of steps where one goes down from the
gardens ; you can see a mile before you there ;
I strained my eyes, but he was out of sight.
I stooped and kissed the hand-rail where his
hand had rested, but it was cold already.
The stone of it said, ' iVo,' through my lips to
my life. . *. .

It is an old story now ! I will not be
moved by it again : I pitied myself for a
while. Now I know that it was all for the
best ; at least I hear you say so. But then I
pitied myself. I think that I was mad with
passion and shame. I had wanted so, that
night of all others, to tell him how I loved
him ! I felt one throb of fever. I drank the
snow from his footprints !  But it is days
and days ago, and all is over.

I ought to have pitied him. He went
back to his lonely home and his dying mother

in the murk blackness of the night. Did he
feel the irrevocable as I did, or did he trust
me better than I trust myself? That icy
wind ! it seemed to lay Death's fingers on
my love. I have not seen him since. I have
suffered, I half forget how.

Elsie, I have written too much. I am not
well, and we are an anxious household. It is
as if a shadow brooded over us these winter
days. Under the wings of that shadow what
boon is brought me ? Is it life ? Is it love ?
I think it cannot be both.

I pull myself together to end my letter ;
the pen has outrun me. I meant to patch
you up my life and live under that same patchwork.
And so I will. I have not told you
all, but I have told you something that will
help you to understand me, whichever way
I act. My resolve is, believe me, to do what
is right. I began to write falsely ; let me say
truly, at least, now, that I am
Your true friend,

Waldine de Stair.

February Sth.  I have just heard that John

Lyne's mother died this evening. I have not
heard it from himself; but I think he will
tell me his wish ; they say that he is going'
away. But news comes shrouded here. Elsie,
my uncle cannot live till spring. The story of
my sojourn here is almost done.

A FAREWELL

This was John's letter at last :  .

February I2th.

Waldine, my Love 

I buried my mother to-day; if I seem to
have told you nothing you will the easier forgive
me by and by. Say, at least, 'He kept his
troubles from me.' Say that when I am gone.

If I can do so, let me tell you facts ; it is
what you bade me do.

The worst fact first : I saw you in the
arms of a man who  I suppose  would laugh
if I should call myself his rival. It is now
many days ago, but I see you still. I shall
see you so until I die.

Second fact, harder to write. I do not blame

you : I do not misunderstand. I have thought
it out. You knew that I was there : you would
have spared me this. You were not  are not
bad enough to dismiss me by these means.

But dismiss me you did. Third fact, which
hangs from these : I am going to leave England
at once. My only love, it is the only way. I
sail by the ship Valentine on St. Valentine's
Day  'tis an omen. . I can't put words
together : you freeze the lava of speech, and
in my heart there is no heat against you. It
is right for you to marry Denham. There,
that is said. It was the hardest thrust of all,
that sword thrust of conviction.

Look how I trust your word ! I do not
leave you choice : I go before you can stay me.
I know that you would come, but to your lifelong
sorrow. You love me, do you not ? Ah
yes ! you love me, but I love you better than
you ever loved me. I will die without you
sooner than let you live for me. How should
it not come home to you at last what might
have been? When I am gone, forget me.
You will suffer a little, but you will know (so

soon ! ) that I was right. If 1 could doubt that
Denham loved you ! . . . But now I cannot.

And I am a dying man. If you did come
with me, it would only be for a few months, and
it would unmake all your life. Oh ! if I live or
die, forget me ; remember only that I loved you
well. So well, Waldine  so well  so well !

The words break my spirit. . . . You will
forget or will remember as you choose.

If you will do something for me, take care
of my parents' grave. I would to God  that
after death  the death I go to meet abroad
alone  I too might lie there. If you would
do me some great thing, contrive me this.

My queen, my child, I am gone ! tomorrow
night I sail. Almost I am glad to be
ridding you of such a burthen. Don't be
sorry : I do not need to say this is not want
of love. It is the one thing that a man who
loves you best can do that is best for you.

For me? . . . Darling, there is a star in
my' soul always : I kissed you first.

John Lyne.

THE FLASHED RECALL

And this Waldine's reply : 

'To John Lyne, Ses. Valentine,
Plymouth.

To-morrow | night | at | nine | the | Willow | Garth.'

No other word, she knew it was enough. The
telegram was sent from a post-office, some
miles distant, to which she had gone for
information on the routes abroad which could
not be obtained at Netherfield. And there was
no reply : it was a command, not a prayer, from
a hand which held the issues of life and death.
He could not reach Netherfield direct by
the cross journey, but he came to the terminus
at Newton, within five leagues, and walked
through the declining day.

[and last]

fulfilment

A MAN and woman face to face alone. St.
Valentine's Eve.

.Night in the Willow Garth : winter night
as soft as spring : over the old familiar meeting-place
the old familiar moon, no doubt, but
shrouded from their eyes.

Underfoot the bedded leaves : about and
around the waste of waters filled with melted
February snows. All dark, all still, all wrapped
in gloom like the grave's.

So often they had met here of late. Further
from John's home than from hers  out of all
human ken  its solitude seldom broken, the
strange place had lent them a trysting spot from

the very first. Waldine could have felt her way-through
the tangle blindfold. Beneath the
larches that enclosed the garth there was a little
stem of blood-red maple which had kept its
leaves all through the frosty weather : it had
been her beacon a thousand times, had saved
her from the perils of that marshy tract where
a false step had landed her so nearly.

And there was shelter for the lovers in the
thickset, wind-proof copse. There was the
old boathouse with the half sunk punt in it
which would never carry Lord Grenvers anymore,
in his favourite wild fowl shooting, but
which was for ever sacred from profane hands
as a record of his liking and his skill. It stood
on the very marge of the lake, and the waters
round it were reedy and deep. The wooden shed
was fallen in disrepair : the door swung loose
upon its hinges : one fold of it had dropped already,
and lay stretched across the wrecked boat.

Against the lintel of that door John Lyne

was standing. He leaned there overpowered

with fatigue  with hunger too, poor normal

need of life ! he had not tasted food that day.

AOL. II. 33

An immense joy was upon him : to reach the
presence of his idol, that was his heart's desire.
But there had supervened on this a numbness
that was new.

He had waited for her a weary hour : now
at last she was here. His famished sight
could feast upon her beauty, his thirsty lips
on her fair face. Such a contrast as they
made! John, travel-worn and tired  a big,
gaunt figure in his mourning clothes ; Waldine
with rich furs draping her to her feet, yet not
wholly hiding her white evening dress. Her
cheeks were pale under the feathered shade
of her velvet hat, and by nearness to the
black lace twisted round her neck. But her
eyes were like bright lights in the gloom :
they were full of pride and power : one could
feel that they only veiled laughter, whereas for
John's set mouth the laughing days were done.
He held her in his arms once more: he felt the
seal-skin of her coat soft and warm against his
stiff hands, he felt her breath upon his chin,
her fingers on his neck. In his ears was the
music of her voice, so many days desired.

'What did you think of me?' she said,
speaking quickly and low  'husband, ever
dearest love, had you not my word that I was
yours ? Oh ! to tell you all ! it has seemed
to me, these empty hours, as if the web of life
were closing round me, as if I soon should be
only a poor woven image of a woman in the
loom of the world. Now I have cut the
threads : I am alive once more I You want
me, do you not ?  you did not wish to escape
me. . . . How I must love you, how I must
know you love me, never to dream of that !
My strength, my master, I will go with you
to the end of the world.'

I wanted you,' said John, ' as one wants
heaven. I did all I could for the world's poor
best. But God is too good for us : the world's
poor best is vile.'

'Do not despise the world,' she said and
laughed ; ' we will make something of it between
us. I am so sanguine, John. I have
no fears. See ! we must learn reason : there
are plans to be made. Tell me all you have
done from the very beginning.'

I am gone,' said John, smiling in spite of
the deathly fatigue and illness that was upon
him,  so magnetic was her will :  ' the only
strangeness is that I am here. I have taken
my farewell of Netherfield : it seemed not hard,
with all that I have lost. And I had paved
the way ere now, in case we went together by
and by : Waldine, you are not afraid ? You
will come with me ? It is for life or death.'

Need you ask it ? But to-night the ship
must sail away without you. Never mind
your things ! Let them drift to America, we
shall find them there. Why have you taken
me at unawares ? I have no scheme of action
ready. Is poor Aunt Linda's providence to work
it all ? Dispose of me as you will, my hero ! '

Only a heavy sigh for answer.

John, you have no courage ! you are cold.'
She freed herself and looked him in the
face.  * What is it ? are you tired  or are
you ill ? ' There was a note of impatience in
her tone which did not escape him ; he knew
all her changes.

Aye, that's it he said softly at last with

a great sigh. ' It's the old grievance, beloved,
which you never cared to hear. But it is only
to-night I am so tired. The heaviness will
pass, the joy abide. Plans, Waldine ? yes,
but let me look at you first. My wife, how
beautiful you are ! how strong, how dainty !
Ah ! the regrets I ought to feel for that poor
London that is robbed of you for ever now ;
but I have none. . . . From the first, Waldine,
from the very first ! There is no face in all the
world but this face of yours for me. Oh ! for
life together !  but not here  not here ! ' . . .
Dear, I have been thoughtless of you !
not for the first time. How often I must
have come here these last weeks to meet you,
pampered and warm, while you have been cold
and starved, in failing health ! John, I have
never thought of this at all till now. I will
make amends  amends ? Have I not power
enough for both. Ah ! this is not fatigue ; it
is a faintness that is on you  the journey, the
long day, the griefs that you have suffered.
And now the waiting and the happiness.
I have been blind and selfish always !

Let me begin anew. . . . Answer me ! John !
Oh ! God in heaven. . . . Here !  your head
upon my heart. Love, answer ! Speak ! ' 

He had slowly sunk upon his knees, his
hands still clasped about her. She tore open
her jacket and pressed his head upon her
bosom with a desperate instinct, new born in
her mind, to give him back the warmth of which
her will had robbed him. Her brain was fire ;
the wild thoughts surged in it  unformed,
beyond control. She had no definite hope,
but just to save him and renew his strength.
With her lips to his eyes, her arms round his
body, she held him up in an embrace that was
like life. It could not leave him senseless.

Mine  mine '  he said at last : and
then

They were on the brink of the lake ; he
had slipped a little on the reed-grown bank,
and she, now kneeling forwards to dip her
hand in the icy stream for his refreshment,
felt that it was only by her force that she
prevented his fall. One foot was caught
already in the sedge, and one hand, loosing

her, sought vaguely, weakly, for the boathouse
door. It was quite dark ; the sky
black, whence some star of help should be
born. There was not the light of a wildflower
on those banks that would grow forget-me-not
in spring.

To-morrow '  he said, as the gloom closed
over his eyes, and tried to lift his lips to hers
for one last kiss that should slake more than
thirst.

And even with that word he had fallen
from the girl's grasp into deep water.

It seemed to her, for one sharp instant, as
of Death's, that her very soul had left her.
She gave a sort of moan that was never made
a cry ; and passionately, madly snatched his
left arm as the stream engulfed him. But
the faintness that had seized him left his
limbs quite irresponsive to her grasp. . . .

And then  what was it ? fate ? chance ?
will ? She let go his arm and buried her face
in her hands. She would not save him, but
she could not see him die.

The solution of Death ! It was the only

way. Her entire being would have revolted
from it as a scheme, but as a fact she accepted
it without a sigh. What was there she could
do ? She was not unconscious ; her strong
nerves never failed her; the water was not
hell enough to drown her had she made one
vigorous effort. She did not make it ; she
obeyed her lot, success. It was to be !

'Best so,' she said at last  it was long after 
and stayed upon dry land.

Not otherwise she could have killed him : she
was made of flame, not mud : she was no common
murderess. But thus, by .this calm death, she
let him perish. Was there any lot on earth
that could have soothed him half so well ?

The grim weeds held him fast , the place
was just his grave, no more. As at last, ashen
white, she rose to her feet, her hand stirred
the old punt a little, which his fall had pushed
aside; it settled back into its place again,
undisturbed for many years, over his loving
heart. Thus time withholds eternity.

There was no trace of him left : with him
had sunk the few poor things he had  his

watch, his money, his cigar-case ; had anything
been left it might have moved her to
some human outcry, to some vain trial of her
strength, some disclosure which must have
shamed her for ever. But there was nothing.
What he left her was an immaterial cross.
To take up her racked martyr-life for the sake
of the world's thorn crown. It sounds  or
should sound  hard ; but was it ? Who shall
answer? Perhaps it was the easiest way, as
well as best : the key to such a riddle is not
here. God holds it.

When she stood up she did not feel
remorse : her one sensation was of a great
difficulty evaded, an infinite freedom won.
The heart-break would come later ; her instinct
now was to escape the past. To stay
here, to behold this place again, that were
madness,  at least that way madness lay.

She did not tarry : the whole tragedy had
taken less than an hour. It was a clean
knife-cut across the thread of the winter's life.
The man that had taught her love lay dead in
the woodland like a wild thing shot or a

frozen bird. As for her. . . . She had knelt
on her dark furs ; there was no stain upon
her dress !

A spring of life seemed bounding in her
breast ; she shook herself clear of the low
undergrowth, stooped through the willows
and ran out of the wood. Something white
and ghostly stared at her forth of the dark.
It was the dog's grave.

On the white wood of which she knew the
words, 'Death loose.'

Before she had been many minutes in her
room, a light footfall sounded in the passage
and Lady Grenvers entered, in studied disarray.
Dear Val,' she said, ' I do neglect you so :
I have not been near you this evening. And
I can't go to bed without telling you something
most important. Launcelot Denham has
written to my poor saint about you.  " To be
your Valentine."  It is such an enchantment
to us both. You will not refuse him. The
prospect of the wedding is fresh life to me,

though I ought to be thinking of  but who
thinks of death for long, ever ? . . . Horrid ! 
I promised not to tell you, but I must.
You would know anyway  alas ! so soon 
Val, you know I never cared for the country
and Launce, though he is rich, has no
house. Grenvers is leaving you White-knights
by will ; on condition that  after
your marriage  you make this place your
home. Sleep upon that ! How fresh and
cool your cheek is !  Dear  Good-night ! '
