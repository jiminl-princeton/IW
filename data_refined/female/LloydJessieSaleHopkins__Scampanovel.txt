Chapter I.

SCA MP."

C A ;M P ! Scamp ! where are
you?" cried a pleasant, manly
voice ; but there was not the
faintest response, for " Scamp," otherwise
Adela Thorndyke, was deep in a
sensational novel, and had no mind to
be disturbed, even by her father.

*' Thomas, what has become of Miss
Adela ? " he asked of the old gardener,
who had lived at the Rectory with him
before Adela was born.

VOL. I. A

A white hand parted the leaves of
an ancient walnut tree, and a dainty
index finger was shaken at the factotum
warningly, even menacingly ; but the
Rector of Winsthorpe was not a man
to be trifled with, except by one person,
his daughter Scamp, his one and only,
and it must be added, spoilt child ;
and although Thomas saw the warning
hand, he dared not say he did not
know where the young lady was.

He pushed back his hat, and screwed
up his mouth gravely, and raised his
honest eyes to his master's face.

"Miss Ad'la's somewhere about, sir,"
lie said. " Maybe she won't be long."

Come, no prevarication, Thomas ;
you know where she is ! " and the keen
grey orbs of the clergyman, who had
once been an officer, fixed upon him
relentlessly.

** Maybe, sir," he returned reluctantly ;

but, you see, Miss Ad'la has ears, and
if she wanted to come  "

I believe you have let her go up
that tree again," said the Rector hotly.

Me let her I " answered the old man,
in helpless bewilderment. " Lor', sir,
how could / ever stop Miss x\d'la ? " and
he laughed an amused chuckle.

A middle-aged lady here joined the
Rector, walking by the side of a tall,
aristocratic-looking man of some five-and-thirty
years of age, whose hair was dark
and close cropped, his features fine and
well-chiselled, while his soft brown
moustache could not hide the sweet
grave mouth ; his eyes were large and
hazel in hue, black-lashed, and earnest
in expression.

My dear," said the Rector irritably,
I believe Adela to be up in that tree,
and I have said I won't have it, over
and over again. One of these days

she'll break her neck, and who would
have thought it ? It was easier to
keep a whole regiment ia order than
that slip of a girl. Thomas, is Miss
Adela up there or no ? "

The hand became doubly animated
among the green leaves, and a pair of
hazel eyes were fixed upon it, while a
smile parted the grave lips.

Well, she be," replied the old man
regretfully. "I can't tell you an untruth,
master."

Oh, you sneak ! " cried a bright,
mellow, girlish voice, and the yellow
paper-covered novel came whirling at the
old man's head.

The gardener ducked, and the book
hit Mr Thorndyke upon the shoulder.

A novel, too, I vow ! " he exclaimed
angrily. " I will not allow Adela to read
novels ; she is too young to have her head
filled with rubbish. Mamma, it is for you

to see that such books do not get in her
way," and he handed it to his wife.

But really, Edward, I know nothing
about it. This volume is not ours ! "
said Mrs Thorndyke, somewhat helplessly,
looking at it the while.

Well, give it to me then, and I'll
find out to whom it does belong, and
they shall have a spice of my mind
upon the subject," and he began to turn
the leaves over with a quick hand.

A sudden commotion was heard in
the tree, and the leaves commenced
to quiver, the boughs to shake, and a
bright espiegle face peeped out from the
branches.

*' Let me have it back, dad ! " said
Adela coaxingly. '* I know you will,
for you are such a dear old pet, and
never refuse me anything."

Nothing that is for your good,
Scamp," ' he replied, the clouds passing

from his brow, and then he turned,
with a smile, to his friend.

*' Did you ever know such a little
witch ? " he laughed. " Ah ! Egerton,
you're lucky not to have a daughter
like Scamp to worry you."

*' If that is Scamp I don't think I
should object," said Captain Egerton,
his eyes fixed on the beautiful, animated
face framed in the tender green of the
walnut leaves.

A golden brown, curly head, which
the sun had caught and turned to
burnished gold, a pair of laughing blue
eyes, set in dark, curved lashes, with
a look of defiance in them. Two
coral-red cupidon lips, and a row of
pearl-like teeth  a fair, white skin, flecked
with a golden freckle, and cheeks which
glowed with health and strength.

Did you ever see such a witch ? "
repeated her father, looking at her with

loving pride. " Adela, whose book is
this ? I mean to know ! "

When Mr Thorndyke called her Adelaide
knew he meant to try and be firm
with her, and that there would be the
semblance of a battle between them, and
she made a mutinous moue.

Then the remembrance came to her
that there was a name on one of the
first pages of the book, and she determined
that her father should not
see it.

The lovely vision vanished, and a
violent scrambling took place among the
verdant leaves, and in a few moments
the girl swung herself down with a
graceful movement and marvellous agility,
and descended upon the Rector with
outstretched arms, which she threw
around his neck, and kissed him on
cheeks and brow ; then, as if purely by
accident, she took the book from his

hand, and he never saw that he was
vanquished.

Mrs Thorndyke recognised the fact, and
smiled, for thus the battles generally ended
between her husband and daughter.

Egerton," he said, " let me introduce
you to my girl," and turning to
her, he added, '' you have often heard
me speak of Captain Egerton, Scamp,
have you not ? "

"Often," she answered; 'but I expected
to see an old fellow like  " and
she hesitated and blushed.

*' Like me, eh ? " laughed Mr Thorn-dyke.
" You see she is truthful, if not
polite, Egerton''

*' I would rather see it so than the
other way. And so, Miss Scamp, you
have heard of me ? and I have very, very
often heard of you; so we must be friends."

Must we ? " she asked, studying his
face. " I shall like that.'

Forward young puss," said her father,
pulling her hair.

Not forward, Thorndyke. honest ; and
now, young lady," he added, " are you
not oroins: to shake hands ? "

' No, I wasn't, because mine are all
dirty from climbing the tree," she laughed.

I rather like clean dirt," he said,
joining in her merriment.

Now, look here, Adela," began her
father sternly, "you are too old for
tree-climbing, and I won't have it ! "

Too old to climb trees, and too
younor to read books ! " she exclaimed
piteously. " Why, dad, where is my
fun to come in ? "

"Bless me, child, are there not plenty
of other things to do ? "

Nothing but riding Peggy barebacked,
and you say I am too old for that ; in
fact, I am either too old or too young
for everything I care to do ! "

Why, Dela, there's tennis, and badminton,
and bowls, and you may ride
on Peggy as often as you like,
with a saddle, and read the books your
father chooses for you, and sit in the
tent, or under the verandah. There, are
plenty of things to amuse you, dear
child ! " said Mrs Thorndyke.

Tennis is too tiring, unless you have
some one to pick up the balls," she returned,
shaking her bright head. " There's
always too much wind for badminton  the
shuttlecocks worry you to death. I don't
care for bowls ; it makes your back ache.
I hate riding With a saddle ; it's too tame,
you might as well sit in an arm-chair
at home. As for books of dad's choosing,"
she shrugged her well - shaped
shoulders with an expressive gesture,
*the less we say about them the better.
As for the tent, it's stifling, and the
verandah is so draughty it gives you

a stiff neck for a month. Not one of
those things will amuse me one little
bit, mother mine ; but I do love a nice
book in my snug corner in the dear
old tree," she added, with a smile.

"Simply because you are told not todo
it," said her father warmly. " Well,
I hope you will outgrow your perversity,
Adela ; it is the fault you should conquer.
For the rest, I have no complaint
against you. You are a dear good girl.
Why, where is that book ? "

But Adela Thorndyke was out of earshot,
or pretended to be, and was running
with fleet steps across the law.

It is to screen some one else, not
herself, she has carried off that volume.
I have said I will not have books lent
her until I have seen them ; but she gets
them, nevertheless, somehow, wheedles
them out of some one, I suppose."

I am certain she would out of ?ne"'

laughed the Captain, "regardless of what
you might say to me on the subject.
If I am to stay here, Thorndyke, I
warn you that your Scamp will be able
to lead me away. I shall find myself
sitting up in that tree with her before
a week is out."

They all laughed at the idea ; but it
soon came about for all that.

FRIENDS.

R and Mrs Thornclyke had gone
out to pay a round of visits,
and the Captain and Adela
had watched them drive off in the village
cart with Peggy, till they were out of
sight.

Then the girl turned suddenly, and
looked at her companion.

'' What shall we do ? " she asked.
Anything you like," he responded.
"I'm at your service."

'* Really ? or is that politeness ? "

** Really ! I'll do whatever you ask me 

if it be to turn Catherine wheels like the
street Arabs, for your amusement. I learnt
the accomplishment when I was a boy."

She clapped her hands.

I should like to see you  but I won't
ask that, for you were wounded in the
head, were you not ? and it might make
you ill."

It's more than likely," he laughed.
*' I forget I am cracked china sometimes."

"And, besides, you are too tall and
dignified for that sort of thing. I shouldn't
like you if you looked ridiculous."

Then you do like me, Adela ? " he said
eagerly.

Of course I do ; you're a dear, and
awfully nice."

They were walking around the garden
now, and she stopped before a rose tree
and plucked him a lovely bud, and
placed it in his button-hole, with the
innocent freedom of a child.

There ! now it is your turn to give
rae one, Captain," she said merrily.

He turned to a syringa bush laden
with white flowers, filling the air with
its sweetness, and picked a spray.

Here are orange blossoms for you,
Scamp," he said softly.

'papa would call that talking nonsense,"
she replied, shaking her sunny
head, " because they are not, and you
know it, Captain Egerton."

Then they came to the old walnut
tree, and stood beneath it.

Don't you want to smoke ? " she
asked ; " I like the smell of tobacco out-of-doors."


I shouldn't mind a weed at all," he
admitted.

"Co up to my parlour," she suggested ;
*sit's quite a little room  place one foot
there, and another there, catch hold of
that bough, and you will find it quite easy."

He caught her young enthusiasm, and
obeyed her to the letter, and was soon
looking down.

What a delightful place ! " he said,
'' Are you not coming up, Scamp ? "

She ascended with far greater ease
than he had done, with catlike grace ;
and in a few moments they were seated
side by side upon the leafy throne
which the girl so loved  he contentedly
enjoying a cigar, while she sat by,
watching the white smoke curl up
through the branches.

He caught sight of the book which
had been the subject of dispute between
her and her father, stuck in a crevice
in the tree, and took it ujd ; and ashe
did so, the leaves opened, and he
read upon the first page the name of
Horace Lake, and his eyes rested upon
the words.

Who is Horace Lake, Adela ? " he

asked, a strange shade of disappointment
crossing his brow, and an equally
strange pain contracting his heart.

'* He's an awfully jolly fellow 1 " she
returned, with animation. " And he does
no end of things for me. I cannot think
what I should do without him."

"Oh, indeed ! And how old is this
paragon ? "

He is about twenty."

"And you?"

"I'm fifteen. But I thought it
wasn't polite to ask ladies their ages ! "

Do you wish me to be polite,
Adela ? "

She sat still a moment thinking,
her large eyes looking into vacancy 
self-absorbed. He laid his hand upon
her arm, and she looked up at him.

Well ? " he said interrogatively.

** I want you to be always just what
you are," she answered, with a smile.

VOL. I. B

A pretty compliment, Scamp," he
said, with a brightened look. " Nevermore,
nor less to you, than I am now ?
Is that your wish ? "

Certainly never less ? " And then
she hesitated, but turned her bright
eyes to his frankly. *' I want you to
promise that we shall always be friends ! "
she went on eagerly. " I know you're
a great deal older, and all that, but
I like you, and I don't care for
many people ! "

Of course, we will be friends,
Scamp. We are friends, my child, and
will remain so, so long as you will
let the compact last."

And he took her hand and held
it in a firm clasp.

Suddenly she broke out into a merry
laugh.

Do you know you are encouraging
me in disobedience ? " she asked.

"I knew I should, if ever I were
put to the test ! " he said, laughing
too. *'I told Thorndyke so!"

Told father ? And what did he
say ? "

He didn't say much. He thought
it was fun, but I knew it was earnest."

Again she relapsed into the transcendental
mood, and as quickly broke
it with the bright upturned glance.

You won't split upon Horace, will
you ? You shouldn't have seen the book,
if I had not thought I could trust
you ! "

"You can trust me. The name of
Horace shall not pass my lips ! "

'' You-are a brick ! I felt sure of it,
or I shouldn't have asked you to be
chums," she replied, with animation.

Brick ! chums ! " The terms would
have sounded fast and slangy from less
beautiful lips than Adela Thorndyke's,

and have disgusted the sensitive ears of
Cecil Egerton, but she spoke them with
such childlike grace and ease, looking
so bright and happy the while, that he
could not quarrel with them in her.

Who taught you slang, young lady ? "
he inquired playfully.

Not papa, you may bet ! " she
laughed. " He's real riled when he hears
me."

Nor mamma ! " suggested Cecil.

Not exactly ; mother is very patient
but slang does nearly give her a fit."

Then why use it, little woman ? It
cannot add to your happiness, and from
your account it diminishes that of your
parents ! "

Not a bit of it. I torment them, and
they enjoy it ; it is like being tickled
with a feather  some people delight
in it. Dad and mam do, in my naughtiness
; they would be quite lost without

it. As to slang, I simply love it ; if weare
to be friends you must not expect
me to be sedate, and sit on my hind legs
all day. 1 couldn't do it for any one,
not even for you ! "

Not for Horace ? " he asked.

Horace ! " and she broke out into
merriment. " Why, he likes it ; he
has taught me all the mischief I
know ! "

Oh ! has he ? You seem an apt
pupil ! " retorted Captain Egerton, amusement
and annoyance struggling for the
mastery in his mind.

** I am," she admitted, "because I enjoy
it so much ! "

'enfant terrible'' he sighed.

By-the-by," said Adela reflectively,
you have broken your word."

I have ! How ? "

'you said the name of Horace should
not pass your lips, and it has ' "

Oh ! I didn't mean to you, child ! "
Well, then you're forgiven  but to
no one else, mind ! "

And what is this paragon of perfection
like ? " asked Cecil, somewhat bitterly.


I never said he was perfection ! I
said he was awfully jolly ; and so he
is!"

'well! what is he like?"
'' Like ? Not at all like you ! "
That is only telling me what he is
not like ! "

Oh ! I see I must mind my P's and
Q's with you, Mr Severity ; you're nearly
as bad as Mrs Jackson, who comes here
sometimes ! "

And what does Mrs Jackson do ? "
"Do! Why, she's an authoress, and
edits me upon every possible occasion.
Do you know any authors ? Save me
from them ! "

'eyes! I know a few!"
What do you think of them ? "
I generally find them inclined to be
silent and reserved ; people are too apt
to try and draw them out, and make a
show of them, I fancy, and they resent
it, and keep their ideas for their books ! "
I wish Mrs Jackson would ! "
Then she began again, 
"Don't they ever try to edit you''
"No ! I suppose they think I'm past it!"
I shoukl be glad if Mrs Jackson
would think that of me," said Adela.

Naughty Scamp ! You should wish
to be improved."

Should I ? " she inquired naively.
"Well I dont  I like being naughty
best. No one would love me half so well
if I were not a Scamp. If I were tractable
and obedient every one would say I
was a very good girl, and there the matter
would end ; there would be no further

interest in me, you see ; but it's a little
excitement for every one to scold me, and
forgive me, and all that, both for them
and for me. It must be very oppressive
to be a saint ! "

It never struck me in that light
before," laughed Cecil ; " but now you
mention it, there is something in the idea.
The wild son is always the mother's
favourite, I do believe."

"Of course he is! From the lost
sheep in the parable down to me, the
naughty one gets all the petting 
the bad little animal got carried, and
all the rest had to trudge home on
foot."

"So I suppose you never mean to try
and become a model young woman ? "

Not I. I should bore myself terribly,
and how Horace and Lilian would laugh
at me!"

"And who is Lilian?"

Oh ! she's a chum of mine, too.
Lilian Freemantle her name is, and shea
very pretty girl indeed. It's a pity
you can't see her ; but she's at school
now. She is the daughter of Sir Richard
Freemantle of Marsden Hall, and he's an
old tartar. He would make a nun of
Lilian if he dared, and if it were not forme
the poor girl would be crushed ; but
I am wicked enough for two, and help
her when she wants it."

I hope you don't lead her into mischief.
Scamp."

Of course I do when I can. Sir
Richard won't let her see any one but
ourselves, and fondly thinks she cannot
take any harm under the Rector's wing, and
when he is here I'm as demure as a mouse."

I didn't know mice were demure."

Now you're editing ! I didn't think
you would be so nasty. You're as bad
as Mrs Jackson."

'' What ! quite ? "

"Well, nearly. In fact, Fm not sure
you're not worse, because, you know, we're
friends."

'* And do you think friends ought
never to correct each other, little one ? "

"Never. They ought to think whatever
the other does is right, and accept
their acts and sayings without question.
That is my idea of friendship,"
she said warmly, " and so it is Lilian's
too."

And Horace's ? "

Yes, and Horace's."

Well, it is not mine, Adela," and he
was silent.

The girl sat still, pondering his words,
and he gently blew away his cloudlets
of white vapour with an unconcerned look.

She hoped he would begin to speak
again ; but he did not, and she was soon
tired of being quiet.

What is yours ? " she inquired at
length.

My what ? " he answered, with apparent
indifference.

She flushed.

** Oh, if you have so soon forgotten, it
does not matter," she said vexedly.

And if I have not forgotten ? "

Then you're a horror ! " she retorted,
springing up, "and I'm off."

He stretched out his hand, and stayed
her.

Where are you going, Scamp ? "

Anywhere away from you ; I don't
care where."

Then you may as well sit down
again."

She hesitated. She didn't really want
to go ; she would much prefer to spend
the rest of the afternoon by his side, but
she was annoyed with him.

'' Will you stay if I give you my

definition of friendship ? " he asked, with
a smile, drawing her towards him.

Yes, if you will do that," and his
smile was reflected upon her face.

Well, sit down, little one, and I'll
try ; but I'm not good at putting my
thoughts upon such subjects into shape."

He took a long pull at his weed,
as if to draw inspiration from it, and
began, 

"I do not consider a friend shuts his
eyes to obvious faults."

That is telling me what you do not
consider friendship, not what you do," she
retorted severely, repeating his own words.

Mocking bird ! " he laughed, " you've
scattered all my ideas, and they were
sublime ! You'll never now hear the
grand image under which I was about
to paint my wingless Cupid."

Oh ! a sort of lost chord, eh ? Well,
if this is the way you keep your

Friendship is love without wings ? '

That will do for my definition, Scamp.
Love may be blind to faults, friendship
is not ; love may make difficulties
fly, for friendship they will only
walk."

How do you know ? Have you
ever been in love ? " she asked, turning
her great eyes upon him.

Never ! Have you ? "

No, but I should like to be ; it
must be such fun."

Fun ? "

Awful fun. Do you know, I am sure
I should torment my lover dreadfully."

1 can quite believe it," he said,

breaking out into a hearty laugh.

** You're a perfect little Phyllis ; your

father should have named you so."

'And what did she do? something

nice ? " she asked archly.

Naughty, and nice," he returned.

'* Don't you know the song ? "

"No; do you sing it ? I have heard

papa say you have a beautiful voice."
"That is very kind of him, I'm sure."
"Will you sing me Phyllis?"
"Well, I'm afraid I can't after that."
' Do, please. I want so much to hear

the words," and she laid her hand upon

his arm in a manner not to be resisted.
He took his cigar from his lips and

laid it aside, and turning to her with

a smile, sang a snatch of the old

ballad, 

Phyllis is my only joy,

Faithless as the wind or seas,

Sometimes forward, sometimes coy.

Yet she never fails to please."

It is very pretty," she said ; " but,
Captain Egerton, do you think I am
faithless ? "

I hope not, child ; but who can tell ?
Even gold must be tried by fire. Of
one thing I am certain, you will be the
joy and torment of some poor fellow's
life one of these days."

Would you be sorry for him ? "

"I hardly know If you loved him a
little  yes ! "

"x\nd if I were very fond of him?"

You would make him wildly happy,
or intensely miserable," he said gravely,
even sadly.

How old are you ? " she asked irrelevantly.


'' I am thirty-five. Why ? "

"Because you were looking a hundred
just now, and as though you had
been a judge on the bench all your
life."

Was I of so very severe an aspect ? "

** Very. Vinegar cruets were nothing
to you."

You're a polite young lady."

*ani I? It's to take the adore off the
compliment about your voice. Go on with
the song, please."

No, thanks ! "

*' You're sulky!" she asserted, looking
at him fully. '' Well, you are. touchy !
I often say much worse things than
that to Horace, and he doesn't mind a
bit."

"Oh, bother Horace ! " he said irritably.

Why, certainly ! " she replied, like a
veritable Yankee, with an exasperating
laugh.

I'm tired of him. Who is the fellow ?
Does he live here ? "

If you're tired of him why do you
ask ? "

Because I want to know, to be sure."

Yell, then, he is the son of Mr Lake,
the solicitor, and he'll be a lawyer himself
some clay, I suppose  although he
doesn't want to be."

*' And what does he desire to be ? "

'dear me, your interest is growing
in the young man," she remarked mockingly.


Not at all ; but as you are my friend,
and he is yours, I ought to know all about
him."

** Ah ! that's a sort of logic, isn't it ? "

Don't tease, child ; you're too young
to know anything about logic."

'' No, I'm not. I can prove to you by
logic that it's raining; now. Horace taught
me how to do it."

Well ? "

** It either rains, or it doesn't rain. It
doesn't rain, therefore it rains. Do you
see ? "

Not clearly."

VOL. I. c

Ah ! evidently the rain is a Scotch
mist in this instance ! "

'' You're a sharp young puss."

Have you only just found it out ? "
she laughed. 'horace says Fm as sharp
as a blunt needle ! "

What a clever simile, and so new ! "
he retorted mockingly. "Well, and what
does this clear-sighted young man aspire
to?"

Well, you see," said Adela gravely, '' I
don't quite like to tell you."

'' Why ? "

You might think me rude ; Mr Lake
is rather a wag, you see."

** Do you mean Horace by Mr Lake ? "

No, his father, who is blessed with
three sons, and he has made up his mind
what to do with each of them."

Oh, indeed ! "

"I heard him tell papa that his three
boys were totally different, and that he

should place them out in life according
to their abilities."

** Wise man," remarked the Captain.

' Horace wishes to enter the army,' he
said to papa ; ' but that will never do,
he has too many brains for an officer 
he must go into my office. Tom's a rake,
he will make a good soldier. Bob's a fool,
and he will do for a parson ; and Horace
is a rogue, he's just fitted for a lawyer.' "

Captain Egerton broke out into a merry
peal of laughter.

The old fellow is honest, at any rate,
and I'm blessed if there is not a certain
amount of truth in what he says."

Papa thinks there's a great deal."

What ! when he's a parson himself?"

"He is one from conviction, not for
the sake of a living, as so many are. A
young man has an uncle a bishop, and
from his cradle it is settled he is to bea
clergyman, no matter what his predilections

are ; and, besides, you're a soldier,
and you acknowledge that there is a point
in the remark."

"That's true. And so your friend is
the rogue of the family ? Does your
father like him, Adela ?"

'eyes, just as Mr Lake likes me. He
thinks him a pickle ; but he can't help
liking him."

Shall I see him ? "

'' See him, no ! He's at college."

Captain Egerton breathed more freely.

He would want you to tell him all
about the campaigns you have been
through if you and he were to meet.
He is always drawing dad out, and sometimes
we have such interesting anecdotes,
until he finds out the fact, and then he
collapses like a telescope."

That's very natural."

But why don't soldiers like to talk of
what they have gone through ? "

Have you ever heard of braggadocio
? "

' Rather ! "

*' Well, soldiers see such strange sights,
and go through such marvellous experiences,
that if we were to tell half we
have seen, we should get the credit of
o-oingr in for it."

In other words, it is not churlishness,
but modesty ? "

In most men, I think."

I wish you would go on with that
song," said Adela, suddenly dashing from
one subject to another.

Will you be very nice if I do ? "

Very, very, most particularly nice ! "

"How will you do it, Scamp?" he
asked softly.

Like this," she replied, slipping her
hand into his. " Won't that suit ? "

Excellently ! " he laughed, as he clasped
it in both his own. " But first, child,

do you know I am going away tomorrow ?
Will you be sorry ? "

'must you go?" she asked, her eyes
upraised to his.

'' Duty calls."

I wish it didn't."

'then you like me to be with you ? "

Awfully, and especially up here in
my own green den."

"I shall remember this afternoon,
Scamp, as long as I live."

'* I expect 1 shall, too."

You are not sure, then ? "

"Yes, I am," she acknowledged, a
dimple deepening in her chin ; " only I
thought I'd tease you."

Phyllis again ! Child, I wonder how
you and I will meet in the future ! "

She looked at him in surprise.

Why, are you not coming back to
Winsthorpe now you have found your
way here once ? "

He shook his head.

Ours is the first regiment for foreign
service. We may be abroad for years,
and 'by the time 1 return, I shall find
you flown from Winsthorpe, perhaps."

Flown from Winsthorpe ! "

"Yes. Married, very likely  tormenting
some fool of a parson, or rake of a
soldier, or rogue of a lawyer," he said,
with the ghost of a smile.

*' I don't think I shall be married,"
she answered gravely. " I might be
engaged."

"Well, well, the one is a prelude to
the other, is it not ? "

"Not necessarily," she returned. "I
doubt if it would ever come to that with
me. It would be orreat fun all the love



making, and that ; but when it was all
made, wouldn't it be dreadfully tame
work ? Fancy being expected to do echo
to any man's opinions ! Why I should

hate him in a week, and make myself
disagreeable, and then he would hate
me, and that would be the end of the
matter."

Until you found another lover to
amuse yourself with, eh ? "

I suppose so," she replied dubiously.

What a child you are ! " he said, a
sudden light breaking out in his face.
Keep so, Scamp  keep so till I come
back. I should like to find you unchanged,"
he ended, with feeling.

*' Should you ? I thought you wanted
me to be an angel instead of a  "

'' Scamp ! " he interrupted, with a smile.
No, child, an angel would be too fluffy
for my taste. Do not change till I
come back, and then  "

Then ? " she repeated, questioning.

How can I tell, child  how can I
tell ? Scamp, Scamp, will you promise
to keep our compact of friendship ? Will

you never forget me ? Child, you have
grown strangely dear to me ! "

'never," she answered, a flush rising
to her fair young cheek, and an unwonted
softness to her eyes. " Cecil, you will
always be one apart from the rest of the
world to me."

And for the first time Adela Thorn-dyke
peeped through the door of childhood
into the golden fields beyond.

A sweet chord Alas touched in her
young heart, and vibrated with tender,
scarcely understood happiness.

Wait, child, wait ! " he said earnestly
; "wait till I come back."

She no longer questioned what was
then to happen  a quivering hope was
turning the child into a woman.

Yes ! I wall wait," she said softly.

Then he caught her in his arms, and
pressed his lips to her pure white brow.

My little Phyllis, my little Scamp !

will you make me happy or miserable ? "
he asked.

Hallo ! who's up there ? " cried the
Eector's voice from below.

For the afternoon had passed, and the
long hours had seemed short to the
friends in the leafy parlour. The visits
where paid, and Mr Thorndyke and his
wife having returned, were puzzled to
know what had become of Captain
Egerton and Scamp ; and so intent were
these two upon their conversation, that
they failed to hear the Eector's footstep
as he came down the garden path in
search of them.

'' Who's up there ? " he repeated
angrily, as there was no response. " I'll
have that tree cut down."

"Don't do that," said Cecil, "it would
be a thousand pities  it is simply delightful
up here, Thorndyke. Do join
us !

'* Join you ? " he echoed. '' Has Adela
dared, after all I said to her ? "

Don't repeat it, dad. I know it so
well by heart ; but you see I couldn't
help it this once, for I was obliged to
show my favourite place to Captain
Egerton, because 3011 know, after all you
said about it, he would have gone away
thinking T had done something dreadful,
if I had not proved to him that it was
entirely prejudice on your part, dad."

Entirely prejudice ! Adela, I forbid  "

Yes, entirely prejudice," repeated
Cecil, cutting him short. '' It is quite
a pleasant, natural arbour. Do come up,
Rector."

Well, Egerton, if you're going to
encourage Adela in tricks like this, it is
a good thing you're off tomorrow."

Ah ! perhaps it is, and now I am
going to ask a parting favour  will you
grant it for auld lang syne ? "

*' For auld lang syne I can refuse you
nothing, Cecil. I have not forgotten
how, when a boy of seventeen, you
carried me off the field of battle under
the enemy's fire," he said, softening.

Did he ? did he ? Oh ! I am proud
of him ! " cried the girl brightly.

You I " said her father, in surprise.

Well, my request is," said Egerton,
*' that you will join us here for this
once .' "

The Rector of Winsthorpe hesitated.

Oh ! do ; please do ! " cried Scamp.
*' Place one foot there, and the other
there, catch hold of that bough, and I'll
give you a hand." And she bent down
such a brilliant face. *' Do, you dear
old dad ; it will be such awful fun ! "

A spirit of frolic seemed to come over
the staid man, and in another moment
he was scrambling up the tree in obedience
to orders.

'' For aulcl lang syne ! " he said, as he
came panting to the top. " I wouldn't
have done it for any other man in the
world."

** Edward," said Mrs Thorndyke's quiet
voice, " where on earth are you ? "

You may well ask," he replied.
Where, indeed ? Scamp has me and
Egerton up here as visitors. Perhaps-you
will join us, my dear ? Nothing will
surprise me after this."

** Nor me, nor me ! " chuckled the old
gardener, as he bent over his spade to
hide his merriment.

Oh ! Miss Ad'la ! She makes everyone
do as she wants."

Mrs Thorndyke, however, declined her
husband's friendly invitation !

Lord CARRUTHERS OFFER.

jHREE years passed rapidly by,
leaving no especial landmarks
behind, but bringing with their
flight the natural changes which needs
must be, in this impossible-to-stand-still
world.

Adela Thorndyke had grown more
beautiful ; the child was exchanged for
the woman, and yet there were glimpses
of Scamp still discernible in the outbreaks
of wilfulness and sudden perversities
 in the old mischievous, half-naughty,

wholly winning ways, in which
she had won hearts to her.

And she went on winning them. She
had more lovers at her feet than any girl
in the county, and one of them was now
a subject of contest between her and her
father. Lord Carruthers was all which a
girl's fancy might picture  tall, well-made,
and handsome ; rich, pleasant, and
honourable ; and yet Adela would not
accept him.

He had been that very morning to the
Rectory, and had enlisted Mr and Mrs
Thorndyke's sympathies in his suit.

They were both exceedingly pleased at
the prospect of having so charming a
man for a son-in-law, and gave him
a warm and hearty permission to ask
their daughter for her love, with but
little doubt as to the result, as they
looked upon the man's animated face.

Adela was reading in the self-same tent

which she had three years before pronounced
stifling, and there his lordship
found her, having left the Eector and
his wife with glad hearts in the study of
the former.

Adela is a very lucky girl ! " said
Mrs Thorndyke, when the door closed
upon their visitor; 'ewe could never have
hoped for a better match."

No, indeed, it will relieve my mind
of a great weight. I am not a rich man,
as you know, and I feel my health to
be failing ; it will be a real happiness tome
to see our child well settled in life."

And to me also ; but, Edward, you
must not talk of failing health at your
age. Why you are not fifty yet, and I
could not spare you, my dear ! " and she
laid a gentle hand upon his arm.

*' You would not be asked. You see,
wife, when a man's time comes, whether
he be old or young, rich or poor,  has

dear ones who would fain keep him, or
none to mourn his loss  he must obey
when he is called from hence."

"May you not be called then, Edward
! " she said, with a sad smile, and
he had stooped and kissed her.

If I were not here, dear, Adela would
ask you to make your home with her, I
am sure," he continued ; " and I should
die content to know that you were both
provided for."

But, Edward, you are surely not
ill?" replied his wife, tears welling to
her eyes.

Perhaps not," he returned, with a
strange smile. " I hope I may be
spared ; I am not tired of my life,
Mary, dear."

She slipped her fingers into his, and
they stood by the window, hand in hand,
watching the tent upon the lawn.

Adela has rejected many good osiers,

VOL. I. D

but she can expect nothing better than
to become Lady Carruthers," said the
Eector, abruptly leaving the former subject.
" I suppose she will come in and
tell us her good news, dear little Scamp !
I am thankful she is to have a happy
lot. With a disposition like hers she will
feel both the joys and the troubles of
life acutely. As Carruthers' wife, few of
the latter will, I hope, come in her way.
And now I must see to my sermons.
This is Saturday, and I am seldom so
late with them ; but I have felt disinclined
to buckle to, to write or think,
all the week, and now Scamp's lucky fortune
has unsettled me. But I must use
my will, and put thoughts aside  that is,
secular ones," he added, with a smile,
turning to his table, and sitting down
before a quire of half foolscap.

*' May I stay with you, Edward ? " asked
his wife. '* I won't talk to disturb you,

and perhaps Lord Carruthers will come
back himself to tell us. I should like to
be here if he does."

'every well, Mary," said Mr Thorn-dyke.
" I don't feel inspired to begin
yet," he ended, with a smile, " so you
will not hinder me, I daresay."

But Lord Carruthers did not return.
He found Adela sitting alone in the tent,
leaning back in a lounge chair, with a
neat little shoe and highbred instep peeping
from the folds of her cream-coloured
dress.

She was looking sweetly pretty, her
fair skin catching a tinge from the ruby
velvet with which her costume was
trimmed, and her well-turned wrists and
white hands fully shown beneath her
half-cut sleeves, trimmed with falling
lace.

Her azure eyes wore a far - off look,
and she started when Lord Carruthers

stood before her, and a slight expression
of vexation crossed her speaking face ;
but the next moment she had risen, and
received him, if not with warmth, yet
with politeness.

Did you not find my parents in ? "
she asked, as she indicated a chair.

Yes, I have seen both Mr and Mrs
Thorndyke," he replied, " and have had
a pleasant interview with them, and now
I have come to torment you, Miss Adela.
I am a humble petitioner."

She looked up inquiringly, no shadow
of his meaning falling across her mind.
She wanted to be alone  to think  so
his visit was unacceptable, that was all.

A petitioner ! " she repeated, smiling.
Well, Lord Carruthers, you may be
that, but don't ask me to picture you a
humble one, at any rate, for I could not
do it."

Could you not ? And yet a man

must needs plead humbly when he is
asking for his life's happiness," returned
his lordship gravely.

She did not answer him, and a flush
rose to her cheek as he continued, 

Adela, you surely cannot be taken
by surprise at this avowal. You must
have seen that ever since I came from
abroad last year I have loved you."

I have not seen it," she returned
hastily. " Had I done so  "

He interrupted her.

** Hear me out, dear girl. Your parents
have given me permission to speak freely
to you, and have desired me to tell you
that they wish nothing better than to
see you my wife."

She turned very pale, but did not
again attempt to check his words, and
he drew his chair close to her side.

"Adela, you are the love of my life,"
he continued earnestly. "Will you come

and be its brightness ? My dear old
place will be no home to me without
the woman of my heart to share it with
me ; to joy with me in my joy, and to
sorrow with me in my sorrows. Adela,
you will not refuse me this happiness.
You will be my wife," and he took the
soft white hand into his own.

I cannot," she said gently. " Forget
that you have asked what I must refuse."

And why ? " he queried, with emotion.

Because, Lord Carruthers, I do not
love you. We have been good friends ;
let us remain so, please."

"Adela, do you love any one else?"
he asked, with sudden pain.

I do not know that I do," she returned
thoughtfully. "A preoccupied
heart is not the only reason for not
caring for a man in that way."

Then you do not forbid me to hope ? "

*eyes, I do. It is of no use for you

to let hope tell you a flattering tale, Lord
Carruthers. I like you too well ever to
love you," she added quaintly. *' And
now think of it no more."

And she looked honestly in his face,
pressed the hand which held hers, and
quietly withdrew it from his clasp.

Not think of it ! " he echoed. " Adela,
you can never have loved, to speak thus
lightly."

*' Perhaps not," she answered. " But
I think I should have the strength of
will to forget, if I tried."

No, no, not if your love were as deep
as mine for you, dear girl ! I have so
hoped ; my every thought of the future
has been filled with pictures of our joint
happiness, our mutual joys ; and now
you say forget, as though the word held
no pain for me."

"" I am sorry to put you to pain," she
replied, laying her hand upon his coat-sleeve

; " but it is kinder to tell you the
truth at once, than to let you dream of
a future which can never be realised.
Sortie other girl, more worthy of your
love than I am, will brighten your home
and cheer your heart with a fuller affection
than I could give you, and make
you a better and more yielding wife. I
should have to love very deeply to make
a man even fairly happy. I am wilful
and exacting by nature, and intolerant
of control. It is all right here at home ;
they do not discover my faults, because
I always have my own way. With a
husband it would be different."

Adela, if that be all, let us try. You
shall have your own way, my darling.
Heaven knows that I should wish it ! "

No ! it would not do. I should
despise you if you were weak ; and yet
I feel that you could never be my
master ! "

You would resent it if a man
attempted to become that, surely?"

Certainly, if I knew it  I should
kick over the traces at once," she said,
with a laugh. " Lord Carruthers, if
ever my love is won, and kept, the
gainer will be a very clever man. His
reins must be of the finest silk, and
strong as iron. If once I see them,
good-bye to his influence ! Don't you
think you are well out of it, my
friend ? " and she save him a brio-ht
heart whole look.

No, I do not. I believe you to be
high-spirited, but as true as steel ; you
will not scare me with your sketches
of character. I shall watch, and wait,
and hope still."

Do not," she entreated ; "it will
only end in disappointment ! "

''Adela, I value the prize too much
to give it up without a struggle," he

said earnestly. " I can never turn
aside from seeking you while you are
free."

Then he held out his hand to her,
and as she laid hers upon it, he stooped
impulsively, and touched it with his lips.

The action had been as quick as it
was decided, and the girl had no time
to show annoyance, for no sooner did
she recognise the fact that he had kissed
her hand, than she knew that he was
gone.

Edward," said Mrs Thorndyke suddenly,
" Lord Carruthers is going away.
See, he is making for the gate, and he
looks upset ; I do hope Adela has not
refused him."

Refused him ! impossible, my dear ! "
but he pushed his virgin paper aside,
and did not appear so assured as his
words seemed to imply.

*' But he is gone ! " continued the
Rector's wife, in agitation.

Mr Thornclyke joined her at the window.

Yes ! his lordship was gone ! There
was no sign of him anywhere, and the
gate was swinging to and fro, as if it
had been opened and shut with haste
and impatience.

I wish I knew what she has said
to him," went on Mrs Thorndyke uneasily.


"Very well, my dear, let us go and
find out. It is impossible for me to
write with my mind in this state of uncertainty
and chaos  I shall have no
sermon ready for tomorrow."

Never mind, preach an old one," returned
his wife, with a smile.

*' Turn over the tub, eh ? Well, I
believe many men do so once a year ;
one old clergyman with whom I was
acquainted told me honestly that was his

system, and his parishioners knew his
sermons by heart, and would tell you
what was coming each Sunday."

He was putting his papers together ashe
spoke, then opened the French
window, and slipping his hand through
his wife's arm, proceeded with her to
the tent.

They spoke as they walked along, and
their voices reached Adelaide

sat up with an eveilU look, scenting
opposition.

'''When Greek meets Greek  '" she
murmured. "They will seek to persuade
me that it would be for my good  and
they may be right  but Adela Thorn-dyke
never breaks her word. I promised
to avait ! I can hold my own
against papa."

By that time the Eector stood in the
entrance of the tent, and was looking at
her gravely.

Adela ! why did you not keep Lord
Carruthers to luncheon?" he asked.

I ? I don't usually issue invitations
without knowing your views, papa," she
said carelessly. " Had you wanted him
to remain I suppose you would have
asked him yourself!"

We expected to meet him again,
dear," began Mrs Thorndyke ; '*we were
greatly astonished to see him going out
at the gate ! "

I don't know why you should be ! He
does not often stay to meals  he is nota
tame cat, like Horace ! "

"Like Horace! certainly not," retorted
the Rector. *' Carruthers is a very different
class of man."

I have nothing whatever to say
against him," replied the girl coldly.

Against him ! I should think not ;
there is nothing but good to be said of
him ! "

I did not know he was such a prime
favourite," she returned, with a smile.
'' Now Horace  "

We do not want to talk of young
Lake," said Mr Thorndyke irritably.
"He is a very good sort of young fellow,
but if he were to ask for your hand tomorrow
I should say ' No,' to him."

Without reference to my views f "
and she let her eyes meet his.

'' I should think such reference unnecessary.
You could not consider
Horace a suitable husband ? "

How do you know, papa ? Did you
ask any one's opinion when you chose
mamma ? "

"No I did not, but the cases are different."


Different ? What ! because you area
man and I a woman ? I cannot see it
ill that light. We have as much to lose
or win in choosing husbands as you cano



possibly have in selecting wives ; but it
is just like you lords of the creation, to
think we should be bought and sold like
slaves."

Adela ! if I really thought you loved
Horace Lake, if I considered him necessary
to your happiness," began her father,
in agitation, " I would put my own wishes
aside."

And let me have him ? "
I could not cloud your life."
You old dear ! " she cried, starting
to her feet. " I only wanted to make
you say something sweet and nice. 1
knew you would if I ran you in a
corner," and she threw her arms about
him in her old impulsive way.

"And do you care for him, my
child ? "

"Care for him, you wise old thing, of
course not," she cried, again smothering
with kisses. " I only care for you,

and you ought to know it, and you will
find it very difficult to get rid of me, I
can assure you."

A look of pleasure rested for a moment
upon his face, but he quickly dismissed it.

*'My dear, you are fencing," he said.
You led me cleverly off the track with
your will-o'-the-wisp Horace, but it won't
do. You know as well as I do that your
mother and I did not come here to talk
to you of /w'm."

* No ? " she answered, with well affected
surprise. "Well, if you are going
to remain for a chat you must have this
cosy chair," and she pressed her father
into it with gentle strength, while she
drew her mother to the only other seat
the tent contained ; and having made
her sit down, flung herself at their feet
with a graceful movement, rested her
head against her mother's knee, and
slipped her hand into her father's.

"Now," she asserted, *'if I'm to be
talked to, I'm ready ! "

'' Vhy did Lord Carruthers go away,
Adela?" questioned her mother, smoothing
the girl's bright hair.

That is best known to himself," she
returned, a flush creeping to her fair
cheeks. " One does not usually ask a
gentleman why he comes, or for what
reason he leaves, when he pays a morning
visit."

"Adela," said her father, 'your badinage
is irritating. We came to ask you
a simple question, and we want a sensible
answer."

"Oh! like that, dad, are you!" she
said, smiling up at him. " I'm so sorry,
for I know by myself one feels bad in
that condition, and I'm quite sure Lord
Carruthers is not worth one unpleasant
word between us."

I am grieved to hear you say so ;
VOL. I. E

he is a very fine fellow, and I like
lira immensely."

So do I, for the matter of that ;
he is nice enough, take him all round."

My dear child," struck in Mrs
Thorndyke, in a deprecating voice, " do
be serious ! "

Never was more so in my life, even
during one of dad's best sermons. I'm
deeply interested  deeply ! "

''Adela! you're enough to provoke a
saint ! " exclaimed the Eector hotly.

Meaning you, dear dad ? " she laughed
brightly.

I really shall be very angry with
you," he began, with veritable annoyance
; but Adela was now on her knees
before him, her golden head upon his
shoulder, her soft white hand smoothing
out his care marks.

No ! you never were that in your
life, darling ! " she said softly. " I'm

still your own little Scamp, and I ever
shall be. It is too late to change now,
dad," and she raised her saucy eyes
to his, full of love and confidence.

Small witch ! " he muttered ; *' it must
have been just such a girl as you who
made poor St Anthony look up from
his good books. Scamp, Scamp ! wil
you ever be a woman, and face the stern
realities of life ? "

'' Soon enough," she returned sadly.
I don't want to begin before I can
help it."

But Lord Carruthers ? " reminded Mrs
Thorndyke, breaking in.

*' Off the line again ! Adela, what a
tactician you are ! Yes, Lord Carruthers.
Why do you lead me from the subject
? "

Simply because I do not wish to
broach it. His lordship is nothing tous
; why should we talk of him ? People

are not pleasant themes of conversation
it is too personal ! "

Of course it is personal," said her
mother. " Adela, Lord Carruthers asked
our consent to his proposing to you."

That was very straightforward of him,"
she returned approvingly.

Of course it was."

Then there was silence.

Well ? " resumed Mrs Thorndyke interrogatively.


Adela looked at her.

"And did hef" continued her mother.

"It is rather a mean advantage to
take of a man to tell of an offer,
is it not ? " she returned, with hesitation.


Certainly not, in this case," replied
her father. " He proposed, of course !
And you ? "

I was highly flattered, equally of
course. Now don't you think I should

jump at the chance of becoming a
countess ? " she asked wickedly.

I should hope you were not mad
enough to refuse such a man, with
such a position," returned her father
with warmth.

** Is there any insanity in our family ? "
she asked quaintly.

Insanity ! Why ? "

** Because I did refuse Lord Carruthers,
papa  refused him absolutely and irrevocably.
I did not say ' No ' in a manner
which meant ' ask me again,' but I told
him plainly it could never be."

Adela, it is too bad of you," said
Mrs Thorndyke, veritable tears starting to
her eyes.

'* You will never get such a chance
again, and we wished it so very much."

Do you really want to get rid of
me, mamma ? " asked the girl, her smile
dying out.

No, child, not to get rid of you,"
replied her father, not unkindly ; " but
to throw away such an opportunity really
does seem a pity, and Carruthers is such
a good fellow. I'm sure he expected
his dismissal as little as I did. What
reason did you give him for your refusal
? "

I do not love him, father, and I told
him honestly that I never should do

so.

How can you tell that ? " said Mrs
Thorndyke eagerly. " Love grows, and
yours may do so."

No. Love is an inspiration, not a
growth," she replied, in a low voice.
It comes without your will or knowledge.
It cannot be cultivated, believe
me."

"And pray what do you know about
it ? " asked the Eector, regarding his
daughter in surprise. '' I'm aware you

have had lots of fellows after you, but
you have assured me you do not care
for any of them."

'' Nor do I."

Yet you have your definition of the
article by heart ! "

She had flushed beneath his scrutiny,
but she was not beaten.

You forget the yellow-covered novels,"
she laughed ; " it is easy to borrow
sentiment."

Very easy," he answered tartly.
*' Adela, some day I hope you will become
more sensible. Carruthers wall not
give you up lightly. I know the
man, and I yet hope to see you his
wife ! "

"Yes!" chimed in her mother, "it
would make us very happy, dear. Try
and like him, there's a good girl ! "

Fancy trying to like one's future
husband," she laughed. '' No, no ; it

Scamp.

really would be that, mamma. Put the
idea from your heads, you two old dears
I shall never become Lady Carruthers
! "

I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN.

Delay THORNDYKE had heard
but little of the man she loved
during the past three years,
but she knew she was not forgotten by
him, for in every letter he wrote to her
father, he sent her a kindly message,
not warm enough to raise a suspicion
of the truth in the Rector's mind, but
sufficient to let the girl know that she
was remembered.

Not once had he penned a line to her
direct, and yet Adela felt he would come
back, if she kept her word and waited.

As if to reward her for her faith in him,
scarcely had her parents left her, thana
servant came and placed a missive in
her hands, and her heart leaped, for she
knew the writing.

It was from Cecil Egerton, now promoted
to the rank of Major ! It was nota
foreign letter, as those to her father
had hitherto been, but written upon
ordinary paper, and stamped with a
penny stamp ; moreover, it bore the postmark
of London.

Long the girl gazed at it in a tremor
of happy doubt. Was Cecil really in
England when she had believed him faraway
in the sunny East ?

After awhile she broke the seal with
eager fingers and read the following
lines : 

"My Dear Miss Thorndyke,  " I have
been very ill, and have been sent home to

England on sick leave. Will there bea
welcome for me at Winstborpe if I comedown
? 1 do not mean from my old friend
the Rector, but from the bright-eyed child
with whom I smoked the calumet of
peace in the ancient walnut-tree. Scamp,
have you kept your promise ? If not,
never again could I bear to visit the old
place, haunted b}'' memories of your winsome
ways ! Send me one line to the
Army and Navy Club, Piccadilly, and
by it I will be guided whether I inform
the Rector of my return or no. 
Yours ever, Cecil Egerton."

Adela sat gazing at the lines before
her, her heart filled with a deep joy,
when a merry laugh sounded close at
hand, and Lilian Freemantle stood before
her.

I have been watching you," she
said.

Spy ! " retorted Adela, with a bright
look. 'were you repaid for your
trouble ? "

Amply ; I've learnt a secret, Scamp !
How sly you have been ! "

I ? I do not understand you ! "

'* Don't you ? Dela, who is that letter
from ? "

A deep flush suffused the fair girl's
face as the dark eyes of the other were
fixed upon her, and Adela did not
reply.

'rit is short for a love letter," continued
the young lady, with an air of
authority ; " but it is one for all that."

** Oh ! you know that, from the vantage
ground of your superior knowledge."

Of course I do. Have you any news
for me, dear ? "

"Regarding yourself? No, not today,
Lilian. You must not be greedy,
and he must not be imprudent. If I

received too many letters, it might be
commented upon ; there are disadvantages
in growing up ! "

Lilian sighed.

"If it were not for you, dear old
girl, I should be utterly miserable. He
is coming home, but I shall not be allowed
to see him, unless you can manage
it for me ! "

"I'll do my best."

"You always do, you dear old pet;
and now about yourself. Why were
you looking so strangely happy when
I caught you, Dela ? "

Because I felt so," she returned
shyly.

*sis that all I am to hear?"

'eyes, that is all to-day."

Shall I know more soon ? "

I hope so."

Then the two girls waited, each for
the other to speak.

Adela," said Lilian, after a pause,
*' do you know people are saying you
will be Lady Oarruthers some day.
What a lovely little countess you would
make ! "

**Do they? Well they are mistaken,
Lil," she answered quietly ; " the position
wouldn't suit me at all, and Lord
Carruthers knows it as well as I do ! "

"I am so sorry. Then you don't
think he will ask you ? "

I am sure he won't," she returned,
with a smile.

"Then I can't think who it can be
with, Dela, but there's no doubt he's in
love ; he's so absent, you can t keep his
attention fixed ! "

Perhaps it's with you, Lil ! "

*' With me ? No, ny affections are
settled ! "

But he is not to know that."

'* I'm sure he might, by my manner."

Your manner ! Why, you're the
veriest little flirt I ever saw!"

You're a nice sort of friend, Dela,"
she laughed. " If I'm a flirt, what are
you?

I'm not sure. Do I flirt ? "

"Rather! why, how you make Horace
bow down to you."

*' Oh ! yes of course ; he knows which
side his bread is buttered."

So do most people, but it is not
that. Horace loves you for yourself ! "

Then the girl suddenly looked up.

AYhat has become of the handsome
captain who was here three years ago ?
You never mention him, Adela, and I
have meant to ask over and over
again ! "

Oh ! he's a Major now ! " she returned,
with burning cheeks.

Lilian looked at her keenly, then broke
into a silvery laugh.

Lies the wind that way ?  in the
East, eh ? He went to India, did he
not ? If you won't give me full information
concerning him, I shall ask the
Eector, and tell him the reason for my
interest in him."

'* And what is your reason ? "

** Your blushes, Adela. Shall I consult
your father as to their origin ? "

Don't, Lilian. I'll tell you all I know
Major Egerton has returned to England."


'* And is coming down ? " cried the
other eagerly.

I never said so."

No, your tongue did not, but your
cheeks did. Adela, I've known you too
long  you can't deceive me. I daresay
that letter was from him 1 Was it ? "

"Perhaps."

*' And was it that made you happy ? "

I won't be confessed," she cried, starting

to her feet, and placing the letter
in her pocket. " Come in and have
lunch with us, and I will walk home
with you afterwards."

Will you ? You are nice. I should
like both, of all things."

Well, then, that is settled. To tell
you the truth, I am rather in disgrace
to-day, and I shall hail your presence
at luncheon as a godsend."

Bad Scamp ! What have you done
now ? Your parents are such old dears.
I cannot take your part if you have
vexed them. You should live with my
father for a week ; he would make you
jump."

No, he wouldn't ; I should manage
him," she laughed.

*' Well, confess ; what have you done ?
If you don't, I'll ask Mrs Thorndyke."

She would not tell you if you did ;
and now, dear, come in."

VOL. I. F

The two girls went into the house,
and Lilian Freemantle took off her hat
and jacket. She was decidedly a handsome
brunette, and made a striking contrast
to Adela's fair beauty.

Her eyes were dark and sparkling,
fringed with long black lashes ; her
complexion olive - hued, warmly tinted
with carmine ; her face oval, her teeth
dazzlingly white and somewhat large.

In fact, she was altogether an attractive,
dashing-looking girl, and one not to be
passed by without notice.

As soon as luncheon was over, which
somehow lacked the ease which pervaded
the household generally, Mr Thorndyke
retired to his study, and after a few
minutes, Adela crept away to write to
Major Egerton.

She only sent him one line ; but it
took her a long time to make up her
mind what to say, and longer still to

decide that what she had written would
do.

She merely wrote : 

I have not forgotten," and signed it
Scamp."

Lilian Freemantle was the best-hearted
girl alive ; but she was decidedly inquisitive,
and Adela had scarcely left the
room when she really did ask Mrs
Thorndyke what was the matter. And
she, poor woman ! was but too ready
to get a listener to her troubles, to
withhold her confidence ; and before Adela
returned, Lilian had heard the whole
story of Lord Carruthers' offer, and
her rejection of him.

Alien the two girls went upstairs to
put on their hats, Lilian took her friend
by both hands, and looked her full in
the face.

'' Oh ! you sly young puss ! " she said,
her dark eyes dancing. " I know how

you vexed your parents this morning !
How could you refuse such a man as
Lord Carruthers ? "

Who says I ever had the chance % "

Come, my dear, give up trying to
deceive me ! I have heard the whole
story from Mrs Thorndyke ! It is
useless ! "

It was not fair of mother at all ! "
returned Adela warmly. ** If I were a
man, I should deeply resent a girl's
telling I had proposed to her ! "

** So should I ! But you have not
done so ! "

No ; but mamma has ! "

"It is safe with me, Dela. You
might have trusted me."

No, Lilian, not with other people's
secrets ! "

"But you were so sly about it!"

Was I ? Then it was not for my
own sake ! "

Why, you made out he did not
care for you 1 "

No, not quite that ! I said he
would not ask me to be his countess ! "

Because you had already refused."

"Just so!"

*' Deceitful  decidedly ! " said Lilian,
with mock gravity. " And oh ! Adela,
how could you % It would have been
such a splendid match ! "

** Yes ! of course it would ! I
appreciate its advantages ; but I cannot
avail myself of them ! "

** Ah ! I see ! You are too romantic
to desire baronial halls, and all that
sort of thing ! You want love in a
cottage, and Cupid as cook and housemaid.
Usual food, which mounts up
butcher's and baker's bills, will not be required.
You will live on the sweets of life,
and thrive on them, pronouncing yourself
intensely happy in your lovers' elysium."

Lovers' fiddlestick ! Don't talk such
nonsense, Lil, or I shall think you
moonstruck ! " said Adela, laughing.
*' No, I am afraid I too well appreciate
the good things of this life ; but
they may be too dearly bought !
Lilian, it makes me tremble to think
what I should do if I were married
to a man and found I did not love
him. I verily believe I should do
something dreadful  cut my throat,
perhaps ! "

** Or his ? " coolly suggested the other.

That would be more satisfactory
by far!"

Then the two pairs of eyes met.

** Lil, what nonsense you talk ! "
said Adela, with a smile.

My dear, the same thought was
passing through my brain concerning
you ! " replied Lilian Freemantle, smiling
too. * And  now if you have finished

mitigating, we had better start. My !
you are a time dressing ; and I have
a stern jparieiit at home, remember ! "

"I like you, Lil."

Of course you do, but what called
forth the sentiment on this especial
occasion ? "

Why, you have been standing before
the glass ever since you came upstairs,
gazing at yourself from time to time
like a female Narcissus ! and I verily
believe, like him, enraptured with your
charms ; while poor little I have had
to dress in the corner, regardless of my
hat being all on one side ! "

With your brain to match, Dela ? "

You're complimentary ! "

Not at all. I asked for information.
Have you answered that letter ? I
suppose you stole away for that
purpose after lunch ? "

And thinking me safely out of the

way, you treacherously pumped my
dear, weak-minded mother, and made
her commit a breach of confidence ? "

"Not a bit of it. I was doing you
a friendly action ! "

"Me! How?"

"Why, if I had not kept Mrs
Thorndyke amused, she would soon have
wanted to know what had become of
her ewe lamb ; and would probably
have sought you, and found you
writing love-letters."

I have not been writing love-letters,
and mamma is in better
training than that ! "

"Oh, is she ? I wish my father was ! "

You give way to him too much,
Lil," decided Adela, buttoning up her
glove.

I'm obliged to clo so. He scares
me. He makes such a noise if I
don't obey him at once."

' Why don't you make a noise too ?
He would soon get tired of it."

Lilian looked at her with open-eyed
wonder.

"My dear, the place would be like a
bear-garden. I couldn't ! "

It would be an unpleasant sort of
remedy for you both, perhaps, but it
would cure him. You allow him to be
quite a tyrant to you."

'that is really substantially true, with
the exception of my allowing him to doit.
I'm awfully afraid of father."

I'm not a bit."

"It is well that you are not. Dela,
would you beard the lion in his den ?
Would you come to my rescue, if ever
he found out ? " she said earnestly, laying
her hand on her friend's shoulder.

Of course I would. I will go and ask
his consent now if you like."

No, that would never do. My boy

must get on first. He must have enough
to keep the wolf from the door without
help from papa. I'm not sentimental,
Dela, but the cottage would content me
very well with liimr

*soh! And Cupid as chief de cuisine'
laughed Delay

dear, I really must go," announced
Lilian decidedly.

"In other words, you prefer to change
the subject," suggested Adela. *' Well !
I'm a generous enemy ; I'll let you off.
I've been ready this half-hour  but you
are such a girl to talk."

** Talk ! Why, I can't get in a word
edgeways if you're within a mile, and
you know it."

I know you're a horrid little wretch ! "
cried Adela, catching her, and giving her
what she called a bear's Img. *sand I
cannot imagine what he or any one else
can see in you."

"My dear Dela," retorted Lilian, "it is
a mystery to me why Major Egerton  "

But Lilian Freemantle's speech ended
suddenly, for her friend had made a rush
for the door, and had flown downstairs
like a lapwing, to avoid the retaliation
she knew she deserved, and Lilian had
to follow her without finishing her broken
sentence.

Mrs Thorndyke was in the passage.

"What! are you going, girls?" she
asked, as she saw their out-door garments.


"Yes, indeed; I expect I shall be scolded
as it is. I didn't know I should stay hereto
lunch."

"Tell Sir Richard to scold me instead,"
said Adela. " I should rather like it fora
change."

"That's a challenge, Mrs Thorndyke,"
remarked Lilian. "You spoil Dela."

I don't feel sure you are not

right," returned the Rector's wife half
sadly.

'send her to the Hall for a month.
Papa will get her into fine order for
you.

'would hef' replied Adela, with dilated
nostrils, and a defiant look. '* I'm not so
easily kept in order, I assure you." Then
she turned, and laid her cheek against her
mother's with a loving gesture. " We
never try that sort of thing on, mummy
dear, do we ? " she said.

** I don't think it would be of much
use, my child," replied Mrs Thorndyke,
kissing her.

"And we quite understand each other,
don't we ? " continued the girl coaxingly.


Yes, generally, dear ; and now goodbye."


"Good-bye, Mrs Thorndyke. May I
come again soon ? " asked Lilian.

Certainly, my dear ; we are always
pleased to see you."

And after a friendly kiss the Rector's
wife watched them down the drive and
out of the gate.

Your mother's a dear old thing!" said
Lilian warmly''

That she is, especially when she lets
out my secrets," said Adela wickedly.
And now, Lil, do you know how far I
am going with you ? "

'' I know how far I should like you to

go."

"And how far is that?"

Why, all the way, of course, but I
know as well as possible where you will
stop."

"Where?" demanded the other.

At the post-office, of course."

Why should I ? There's a letter-bag
at home."

*'A letter-bag at home ! " echoed Lilian,

'' Of course there is ; so there is at the
Hall, but those are only for ordinary
letters, my clear child."

Oh ! that is how you manage, is it ? "

You know how / manage everything.
I'm not so close as you are, Delay*'

"I'll go right home with you, if you
like, Lil. So much for your suspicions."

Lilian looked at her watch.

"All right, you will still be in time
for the post on your way back," she
laughed.

"The 'post I You're post mad," said
Adela. " I've a good mind not to go
another step with you," but she went on
for all that, as far as the massive gateS
of Marsden Hall, and as she returned,
she walked close by the wall of the postoffice,
and dropped a letter into the
box.

\mm,

A DISAPPOINTING MEETING.

LESS me!" cried Mr Thorn-dyke,
a few earnings after,
as he sat at the breakfast-table
with an open letter in his hand.
Why, Cecil Egerton is in England, and
is coming to look us up ! He says he
will be here to-day, knowing that he
will always find a welcome in the house
of his old friend. My dear, you must
order a room to be prepared for him.
Of course we shall be glad to see him,
and I am sorry he has been so ill.
Scamp, here's a chance for you to show

your powers of nursing. You will like
a visit from the Major, will you
not?"

Adela did her best to look unconscious,
but a tell-tale colour dyed her
cheeks.

'' I am sorry Major Egerton has been
ill," she said gently. "Does he tell you
at what time he will arrive ? "

*' No ; I wish he did, for your mother
and I are going into the town shopping
after lunch, and we should like to be at
home to greet Cecil. You may be taking
him up into the tree again  who
knows ? "

The girl shook her bright head.

"Have no fear," she returned, with a
smile. " I have not been there since
that day."

I remember ; it was a sudden conversion.
But I never understood why
you gave it up all at once."

Did you not wish me to do so,
dad ? "

'undoubtedly, my dear ; hut you don't
always follow out my wishes."

Don't I ? " she returned thoughtfully.



No, or you would now be engaged
to Carruthers."

"I am weary of the man's name," she
cried petulantly. " Papa, why do you
want me to be engaged ? I would rather
stay at home with you and mamma."

That is all very well, Adela, so long
as we are spared to you ; but if we had
gone over to the great majority, what
would you do then ? "

I should wish to die, too," she answered,
tears starting to her soft eyes.

But we cannot always do what we
wish ; and when Carruthers told me he
wanted you for his wife, a weight seemed
lifted from my mind."

VOL. I. a

Dad, I am sorry to disappoint you ;
but it can never be," she said earnestly,
and, rising, she went to his side and
kissed him.

"Well, well, when the time comes,
choose wisely, my child  a man who is
able to support you. It is a sorry thing
for a woman to have perpetually to solve
the question of how ends are to be made
to meet, and requires a deep and unusual
love to bear the strain without
being weakened by it."

If love deserves the name, father,
trouble must draw those who share it
closer."

"It is possible, my dear ; but it is not
the usual result."

"It would be a happier world if it
were," said Mrs Thorndyke. "There is
nothing sadder than for two human beings
to wreck their lives by the fatal mistake
of marrying without deep affection."

And yet you would have me accept
Lord Carruthers ! " replied her daughter
hotly.

For a moment the Eector's wife was
silenced  she felt she had played a wrong
card ; the next, she answered gently, 

Lord Carruthers is a man we could
entrust with your happiness, my darling
; few real troubles could reach you
as his wife."

"Not so, mother; the greatest of all
sorrows would be mine, to be daily and
hourly with him, maddened by the
knowledge that I was bound to a man
I could not love. I should soon hate
him ! " replied Adela, with brightly flashing
eyes.

Hush ! my dear, do not say such
things. I hope you could hate no
one."

"Could I not? Mother, I could be a
good hater ! "

I do not like to hear you say so,"
said Mrs Thorndyke sadly.

Poor old mother ! I am not like
you ; you have a far gentler nature
than mine. I am sorry to horrify
you ; but you cannot quite realise
how keenly I feel things," and Adela
kissed her affectionately, and left the
room.

'' She is right," said the Eector, after
a pause. " Scamp is strong for good or
evil. May Heaven grant that the
strength of her nature may be turned
into a right channel ! She will love withall
her heart and soul, and that very
love will wreck her if mismanaged," and
he sighed deeply.

I cannot think her strong for evil,
Edward ! " said Mrs Thorndyke warmly.
Adela has a most generous nature ;
she has never harboured a mean thought,
or done a shabby action, and she has a

strong sense of religion, although she is
not fond of talking of it."

She has a grand character, Mary,"
returned Mr Thorndyke, "in which there
is room for large faults, but no petty
ones. Believe me, she is just the woman
to suffer keenly."

"Poor Dela ! " sighed Mrs Thorndyke.
I hope her life will be a happy
one.

Amen I " responded her husband, and
silence fell between them.

At lunch the Eector talked of little
else but the anticipated arrival of his
friend Major Egerton, and Adela listened,
but took small part in the conversation.
A sudden coyness and reserve seemed to
have come over her.

Papa," she said, " you will be back
to receive him, will you not ? "

"Yes, undoubtedly, if I can' he had

replied. "Your mother says he did not
arrive till nearly six last time, and we
will call at the station to meet the
down-train from London at half-past five,
and bring him home with us in triumph.
Will that do ? "

Very nicely indeed ! " she returned,
with a smile. "You don't think he will
come earlier ? "

I can't see why he should ; he never
has done so before, and he would have
to leave town very early to save the
previous train. If he should arrive, however,
you will be here to receive
him 1 "

I don't know," she responded shyly.
I might not be in, either."

"You had better not go out, Dela,"
said her mother. " You and Major
Egerton used to be great friends  surely
you will be pleased to see him ? "

She flushed hotly.

It is so long ago ! " she replied.
*' He may be changed since then, or may-think
me so."

Egerton is not the man to change ;
all the years I have known him he has
been the same," asserted Mr Thorndyke
stoutly.

That is a character worth having,"
said Adela, and then she turned to her
mother.

When do you start, dear ? "

'* At once, I must put on my bonnet.
Peggy was ordered before lunch ; dinner
punctually at seven. Adela, look after
the cook a little, will you, my child \ "

Shall I prepare the pastry for you,
mother ? You always say it is nicer when
I do."

Yes, you make it so light ; do it,
there's a pet."

"That I will, with pleasure."

Can I get anything for you in the

town, Adela ? " asked Mr Thorndyke,
rising from the table, and waiting in the
doorway to put the query.

No thank you, papa. I have everything
in the world that I want ! "

What ! everything ? " he replied, somewhat
quizzically ; but Adela pretended
not to hear, for she was speaking to her
mother, but the clear skin showed a
passing flush.

An hour later she was in the kitchen,
wrapped in a large holland apron, embroidered
in fern leaves, with her sleeves
well turned back, her rounded arms
whiter than even nature had made them,
powdered with flour, keeping her promise
to her mother of making; the
pastry, while the cook had betaken
herself to the scullery to attend to other
matters.

Adela, much as she longed to see Cecil
Egerton again, shrank shyly from meeting

him, especially in the absence of her
parents.

She had thought of paying Marsden
Hall a visit, on purpose to be out of the
way when he arrived ; but her mother's
wishes had prevented her doing so. She
felt that her own invitation had brought
him down.

He had sought it, to be sure, but she
would have preferred that he had come
without question, and a strange mingling
of feelings jostled each other in her mind.
She had admitted " that she had not
forgotten," was not that as good as ask-nor
him to come forward ?

The colour leapt to her face as the
thought came to her, and caused a
sudden mental rebellion  her very fingertips
tingled with pride-born shame.

'' No man should gain her unsought,"
she told herself, and there was a bright
defiant look in the blue eves, such as

they had often worn in childhood, but
which had not been seen so frequently
of late.

There was a slight sound in the doorway,
and Adela looked up to meet the
loving gaze of Cecil Egerton.

For one moment she turned pale with
suppressed emotion  the next she was
holding up two flour-covered hands.

Wretch ! " she laughed, " how dare
sou come here ? I'll call cook to pin a
dish-cloth to your coat, as a punishment
for invading her dominions. Where have
you sprung from ? We did not expect
you here till six o'clock. Papa is going
to meet you at the station, with Peggy
and the trap."

Have I come too soon, Adela ? " he
asked, with a slight intonation of reproach
in his voice.

Why ! don't you see you have ? I'm
making tarts ! "

Cannot I help you ? "

*' You ! I cannot imagine Major Egerton
up to his elbows in flour at all ! " and
she broke into a merry laugh.

Let me try," he said softly, coming
close to her side.

No, no, avaunt ! Who ever heard of
a soldier in the kitchen ? "

A good many people, if they live ina
garrison town ; it is difficult to find
one where there is not a soldier."

* Are they indeed so invincible ? "

ere you not going to shake hands,
Adela ? "

*' Certainly not, in my present capacity
; there's time enough for that."

A look of disappointment settled upon
his eyes.

ril dip mine in the flour too, then
we shall not be able to laugh at each
other," and he moved towards the jar ; but
she snatched it up with sudden perversity.

No, no, you would spoil it ; and
now, tell me how did you know where to
find me \ "

'' I walked from the station, saw your
parlour-maid in the hall, and learnt from
her where you were. She was with you
when last I was at Winsthorpe, and
knew I was to be trusted."

'' Then she is better acquainted with
you than I am, Major Egerton."

Her words pained him, and he was
silent. He had expected a different
welcome, and yet Adela's heart was full
of love for him, full enough even to
satisfy his craving for it, had he been
able to gaze into its hidden depths!

Suppose you go into the dining-room,
and ask Sarah to give you some lunch ? "
she suggested.

No, thanks ; I don't want any," he
answered, with a shade of annoyance.

"Have you had it?"

"Often," he replied.

"But to-day?"

"No; not to-day."

She walked to the door and called to
the parlour-maid, and gave some orders,
and after a while the woman appeared and
said all was ready.

By that time the cooking arrangements
were over, and Adela shook her fingers
clear of the flour.

"Now," she said imperiously, ** come
and have something to eat."

Are you ordinis with me ? "

"You see I am."

Very well," and he followed her
meekly.

When they reached the dining-room he
made a capture of her white hand.

Adela," he said simply, "I received
your letter. It made me very
glad ! "

Did it \ " she answered, with crimson

cheeks. "Will you take chicken or
beef?"

Neither, thank you," he replied, loosening
her from his clasp.

'what then?"

''Oh 1 a glass of wine and a biscuit,
please."

She pushed a chair out from the table,
poured the sherry from the decanter, and
placed a silver biscuit-box before him.

I wish I could persuade you to take a
proper meal," she said ; " and now. Major,
you will excuse me while I go upstairs
and take off my apron, I know. When
you have finished, you will like a cigar
in the tent, and I will join you by-and-by."


Saying which, Adela Thorndyke left the
room.

Cecil Egerton looked after her.

Scamp ! Scamp ! " he murmured, " and
you said you had not forgotten me. Would

that 1 could forget, if this is my reception,"
and he rested his head wearily
upon his hands.

Then he raised himself, and sipped his
wine.

She is more beautiful, more bewitching
than ever. I cannot give her up ! "

The entrance-gate swung upon its
hinges, and he looked out in time to
see a tall and handsome young fellow
walk in, as though he were quite at
home.

He gave a very peculiar whistle, and
to Egerton's surprise it was answered
from the window of the room overhead,
and Adela's voice came to him distinctly.

' Go into the drawing-room ; I'll be
there directly."

The other gave her a bright look, and
obeyed, and Cecil sat still, a great pain
creeping about his heart.

Why did I come here ? " he asked

himself passionately. " Why did she tell
me she had not forgotten, if remembering
meant this ! " and he waved his hand
impatiently in the direction of the draw-groom.



He listened to every sound, jealousy,
octopus-like, throwing its cruel feelers
about his heart's peace, and holding it
bound.

He heard her light footsteps run down
the stairs, and the door close upon her,
and let his mind picture the meeting in
the adjoining apartment.

Have you anything for me to-day,
Adela '{ " said the tall youth, with an
eager look.

Will you be very grateful if I say
yes ? " she asked.

"Have I ever been otherwise to you?"
he replied, toying with the hanging ribbon
on her sleeve. '* You have been my
friend for so long that I don't think I

could do without you if the trial of
separation came."

** AVell you will have to this afternoon,
for I have a visitor."

A visitor  you f "

She nodded her bright head.

Is it Carruthers ? " he inquired,
*' Adela, that man loves you dearly."

Lord Carruthers  nonsense ! Why
should he be here ? " she answered
sharply.

To see you, of course, and he might
do worse."

*swell, it is not his lordship, but an
old friend of papa's, and I must go to
him."

"Old! How old?" he said, with
interest.

Oh, as old as the hills ! "

'* I daresay ; but there are mole-hills
and mountains, you know. Which is
he?"

VOL. I. H

The happy medium, of course ; and
now here is your share of the spoil,"
and she drew from her pocket a small
packet.

You are good to me, Adela," he said,
clutching it eagerly. 'when may I
bring my answer?"

She pondered a moment.

'* To-morrow evening it will be safe,
I think. Suppose you come here at eight
o'clock ; I will leave the dining-table.
They will be over their wine then, and
I will meet you in the tent for a minute
; but you must not stay  it would
never do for my parents to suspect."

Of course it would not at the present
time. What a hornet's nest we should
raise if the truth were known now."

'* Well, realising that, my dear boy,
you had better go at once."

I daresay ; but, x4dela, we used to
be such friends ; I scarcely had a thought

I did not bring to you in the dear old
days. I wish they had never passed.
We were so jolly together then ; no restrictions,
no proprieties. I verily believe
it is these difficulties which get people
into scrapes, instead of keeping them
out of them, as they are intended todo."


** There is no incentive like opposition,
certainly," she replied, with a smile;
'' but, after all, I don't think you have a
very bad sort of life."

"No, thanks to you."

Well, you really must go now, or
I shall be obliged to discontinue my
countenance."

Discontinue it, Adela ! You don't
mean that  I could not get on without
your help at all. Look here, little
woman, no one can ever be such friends
as we have been ; promise me that
nothing shall ever make a split between

us  no one could do so on my
part," and he leant over her eagerly.

Am I the sort of girl to be dictated
to ? " she asked.

I should like to see the fellow who
attempted it," he laughed.

So should I ! " and she joined in his
merriment.

I think he would have a bad time
of it. No ! No one shall ever part
Adela Thorndyke from her chosen friends
do not fear."

And she held out her hand to him.

'* You are a dear old girl ! " he returned
enthusiastically. *the best friend
I have in all the world."

'' Of course I am ! " she said gently,
touching the packet. " And now do

go."

Very reluctantly he bade her adieu,
and she stood by the window to watch
him depart, then passed into the diningroom.

Cecil was apparently busy with
the newspaper, and did not look up.

'' Are you ready for your cigar ? " she
asked.

'* Thank you," he replied coldly.
I am not oroino; to smoke," and went
on reading.

She waited for some time, but he
never raised his eyes.

After a while she took up her work-basket,
and artlessly left the room by
the French window, and entered the
tent.

The meeting between Cecil Egerton
and iVdela Thorndyke had not been at
all what they had pictured it.

IN THE GLOAMING.

HEN the Rector and his wife
clove in through the garden,
Adela ran to met them.
'has Egerton arrived?" asked the
former ; " he was not at the station."

He is in the dining-room," she replied
; *' at least I left him there reading."
Hearing voices, the Major came out,
and a hearty greeting took place between
the friends.

"You're not looking the thing at all,"
said Mr Thorndyke decidedly ; "but I

hope Winsthorpe air will soon set you
up again  it is counted good."

** Adela and I must take care of you,"
added Mrs Thorndyke, and turned to
her daughter, who was aimlessly plucking
the leaves from a rose, for a corroboration
of her offer.

''I beg your pardon, mamma, what
did you say ? " she returned, to avoid
replying to the question, which she had
heard distinctly.

Cecil looked at her with grave reproach.

1 do not think I shall be here
long enough to benefit by your good
offices," he said sadly.

Is your furlough such a short one ? "
inquired the Rector. "You don't look
much up to duty."

It is long enough," he answered,
almost wearily ; "I came home for one
purpose, and in that I have been grievously
disappointed. Had it been my

health only, it would have been better
for me to have gone to the hills."

And cheaper ? "

Decidedly cheaper, and that for a
poor man is a thing to be considered."

'' How is that old uncle of yours ? I
suppose he is alive still. It seems a
shame he should live so long, and keep
you out of so good a property, dien he
has no one to live for but himself"

What ! did I not tell you ? I certainly
thought I had written you my
wail ! ' "

"Your wail! then the letter never
reached me. What is the matter ? "

'* I am no longer his heir."

The Rector stopped short, and gazed
at him with blank astonishment.

My uncle has married."

"That old fossil married?"

*' Yes ! a young and pretty wife, and
they have a little boy."

'' Don't, don't ! " cried the Rector ;
** this is too much ! Why, Lord Lyne-stone
must be eighty ! "

'not quite so old as that, but he is
seventy seven, and I certainly never
expected him to marry after his long
life of bachelorhood and misogamy."

"And you are reduced to your pay,
minus expectations % "

I have only my pay, and no expectations."


A poor prospect, in these fast-going
expensive days ? "

'' I have managed so far, and conclude
I shall be able to continue to the
end."

It shuts out all possibility of marriage,"
continued the Rector, " which
is hard on a man."

'* You think so ? " returned the other.

Do not you ? "

*' I have not looked at it in that light.

There are happy poor couples as well
as rich ones, I suppose ; but perhaps
you are right."

I am sure I am. I would never ask
a girl to carry the knapsack, for my
sake. It would be a hard life ; don't
you think so, Adela ? "

*' I cannot agree with you, papa,"
she said decidedly. "If a girl's love
were worth having, she would doubly
cling to a man if he were in trouble,
and be but too glad to share his life ;
in the lack of other happiness the
more ready to make it for him herself."


Cecil Egerton's heart gave a great
bound as he looked at the animated
face, sweet with gentle emotion, the
earnest eyes, the quivering nostrils, and
trembling lips. Oh ! if he might transplant
her into his bare life. He was
a favourite in his regiment, but there

<b

was a depth in the man's nature which
could not be touched by external pleasures
: a lono;ino; in his mind for a soul

CO

to reflect his own, a heart which should
beat only for him, a life utterly intermingled
with his ; a want, a need,
which could only be satisfied by one
the woman of his love.

For one brief moment the eyes of
these two met, the next he was walking
along by the Rector's side, but it had
relieved two hearts of a dead weight.

Adela knew that he loved her, and
once more hope revived in his breast.

She was thinking no longer that her
words had brought him to her side ;
she was grieving for his disappointment,
and longing to make up to him
for it.

Mrs Thorn dyke went indoors to take
off her bonnet ; some one came to speak
to the Rector, and Cecil and Adela

found themselves alone, under the old
walnut tree.

"Do you remember our afternoon up
there ? " he asked softly.

"I do not forget easily," she replied.


Nor I, Scamp ! Do you recollect
how you promised always to be my
friend ? " lie continued earnestly.

More ; I renew the compact," she
answered, with an eloquent upward
glance. '* Major Egerton, I am so sorry
you have been ill,  so sorry you have
met with disappointment. It was inconsiderate
of your uncle, very."

"I do not know that ; if I could
but believe that he and Lady Limestone
really care for each other. I should not
grudge either of them their happiness.
My motto is  ' Love before all else ! '
Adela, is yours the same ? "

She looked down nervously upon the

ground, and traced a pattern with her
dainty shoe.

I am afraid to boast," she acknowledged
quaintly ; "I cannot sometimes
understand myself, my own wilfulness
overcomes my best intentions. I mean
to be very nice, for instance, and a
breath will change my mood, and make
me utterly perverse. Did I seem glad
to see you to-day ? "

No, Adela, you did not. You pained
me by your cold and almost mocking
reception."

I am sorry," she said humbly, " for
I was glad ! "

A great light beamed in the man's
face.

**My darling!" he murmured passionately,
''if I dared believe that  if I dared
believe that the love which fills my whole
being is worthy of a moment's thought
to you, that you could be satisfied with

the lot of the wife of a soldier of fortune !
Scamp, no words of mine could ever
tell you what my devotion has been to
you. Your image has filled my mind
day and night since we parted ; my one
hope and longing has been to return, and
ask you to be my wife, and to-day when
I came, I thought that hope was over."

'' Do you love me so dearly ? " she asked,
with shy tenderness.

' So dearly ! " he echoed. " Ten times
more dearly than my words can paint, or
your mind picture, my darling. By day
your dear image has filled my thoughts,
all my hopes and aspirations have been
for you, and in my dreams my arms have
clasped you with fond possession."

I am very glad," she said softly.

My own, are you really ? Is it
possible ? "

Well, very nearly," she replied, a
dash of mischief rising in her eyes.

'My Phyllis!" he cried, "did I not
tell you you would always be some one's
love and torment ? "

Yes, something like that," she answered,
with a happy smile. "And now
am I to torment you, Cecil ? "

"Will you, sweet one?" he asked
earnestly. " Have you really waited forme?"


I have not waited for any one else,
certainly ; I felt that you would come
back, Cecil."

"Dearest of girls, what a brute I have
been to you. I must have wasted two
hours away from you, and only because
I mistrusted you. Adela, can you forgive
me ? "

Yes, if you will trust me always in
the future. In this case 1 was as much,
or more, to blame than you were ; but,
Cecil, there is one thing I must exact
from the man I love  perfect trust ! If

that were wanting, he could be nothing
to me : want of faith I could never
forgive."

Adela," he said, in a low voice, " for
the love of Heaven never let anything
come between us  you are my very
life ! "

Heaven grant that nothing ever
may ; but we have both such strong
wills, Cecil. Of one thing, however, be
assured  I love you, love you with all
my heart ! "

And her hand crept into his.

There was no one there to see them,
and the leafy boughs of the walnut tree
sheltered them from notice, and closed
them in.

He drew her to him nearer and nearer,
his eyes fixed upon hers in a transport of
ecstatic feeling. His arms found their
way about her slender, sylph-like waist,
and she felt her very being merge into

his, with a strange, deep, delicious
meaning.

She neither moved nor spoke, but just
yielded herself to his embrace, unutterably
happy.

From that moment she knew she Alas
his very own, that the shadow of
no other could ever enter her heart,
that she was Cecil Egerton's, and his
only.

He lifted the loving face to his, and
kissed her upon cheek, and brow, and
lips, his own lingering unbidden in suppressed,
passionate bliss too deep for
words.

And she quivered in his arms like a
frightened bird  yet had no fear, but a
deep, tremulous joy ; if fear she felt, it
was at the greatness of her own happiness.


The first dinner-bell broke in roughly
upon their love-dream.

VOL. I. I

It was too bright to last," he
said, with a sigh, as he released her
from his arms ; " but, Scamp, my darling,
you have promised to be my
wife."

Yes, Cecil, I have promised."

Sweetheart, when shall I tell your
father ? "

She started.

Not yet. He will oppose our wishes.
You heard yourself what he said about
marriage," she replied, with agitation.
"Let us be happy while we can. You
must tell him before you leave, I
suppose ? "

** Certainly, dear one ; it would be
wrong not to do so. I should rather
tell him of my happiness to-night."

"No," she said sadly; "let us have a
few days in peace."

Adela," he answered earnestly, " your
father loves you too well to cross your

wishes, and has too much regard for me
to blight my life."

My father is as good as gold ! " she
went on excitedly; "but he is strong in
his opinions as to what would be for ray
happiness, and what would not; and your
avowal of your poverty is still fresh in his
mind."

Adela, you weill not give me up, even
should your father say * nay ' ? "

No ; in that case, I should merely
wait until I am of age. My opinions areas
strong as my father's," she answered,
with a glorious look.

'* My brave, noble-hearted darling ! " he
cried, looking at her with tender admiration.


And the second dinner-bell rang out.

Do you hear?" she asked, with a glance
of comic dismay.

Indeed I do, and I must put on a black
coat."

*' Papa will prefer your appearing in
your grey one to being kept waiting ;
nothing offends him like want of
punctuality."

I'm really ashamed."

So am I. I have my morning-dress
on still ; but never mind, if we don't tell
upon ourselves, perhaps no one will find
it out."

I really must apologise."

Eemember, qui s excuse, s accuse,"
she laughed, as they hurried along side
by side.

Adela ! Egerton ! " resounded from
the stentorian lungs of the Eector.

'* We are coming," replied his daughter,
who entered the dining - room with a
beaming face.

"So is Christmas, my dear ; it is five
minutes past seven."

He was standing with his watch in
his hand in a perfect fidget.



Will you excuse my coat ? " asked
Egerton. " I'm afraid we are rather
late."

** I'll excuse anything, if you will only
come at once, the fish will be completely
spoilt. Like Wellington, I like more
than punctuality ; you know the story
of him, of course ? "

No, I am not sure that I do," replied
the Major, anxious to let him
talk.

Thank God ! " said the Rector earnestly,
suddenly remembering his grace,
which, in his excitement, he had 
forgotten, good man though he
was.

It came in so strangely, that Arbela
had difficulty in keeping her countenance.
Every one seemed in good
spirits, the non - punctuality ruffle soon
wore off the Eector's mental feathers,
and he was pleased to see his friend,

to talk of old times, to hear about the
sentiment to which he had once 



longed, and to learn of his old comrades,
many of whose fortunes had
changed with the wheel of time, as a
turned kaleidoscope, making various strange
devices.

Some were married, some dead, some
gone along the road of ruin too far to
be recalled, some still upon the brink,
a few had climbed the cliff of life manfully,
and were at the top of the professional
tree, a few more had prospered
in other paths.

Mrs Thorndyke and her daughter retired
early, and left the two men to
enjoy their conversation, and their wine.

It was not wonderful therefore, that,
the past revisited in thought, the Rector
should open his mind to his friend, and
tell him about his daughter's unlooked-for
rejection of so eligible a match as

Lord Carruthers, and his own deep desire
for his acceptance.

Goodness knows what the girl wants,"
he said irritably. " Carruthers is as
nice and as handsome a young fellow
as you could meet with, besides all the
worldly advantages which he has at his
back."

"Is he tall and Mr ?" asked Cecil
thoughtfully.

Yes ! you don't know him, do
you ? "

I fancy I have seen him," he answered
sadly, with the remembrance springing
into his mind of Adela's visitor of the
afternoon, wiom he had in his happiness
forgotten, then he continued,  " Are you
sure Miss Thorndyke does not really care
for him ? Sometimes people have some
slight tiff, which spoils their whole lives,
the mischief even going so far as the heart
being; caught at the rebound. There can

be but little prospect of happiness in such

a case."

She says she does noil' replied the
Eector, " but even the most truthful girls
ivill tell tarradiddles about their love affairs.
I still live in hope of seeing them united
some day."

Cecil Egerton sighed ; his pleasure in the
conversation was over.

A bright, handsome face obtruded itself
between him and his peace.

It was doubtless Lord Carruthers whom
he had seen, and he was of course still
trying to gain her, and, moreover, they
appeared to be on the best of terms.

Should he ask Adela to explain the
young man's visit ? or would she consider
that mistrust ?

Major Egerton was of a jealous nature,
and jealous people seldom use sound judgment
in reflection.

Thus it was that he simply tortured himself

about Adela's visitor, and let his suspicion
rankle.

And the girl, all unknowing, joined him
in the garden in the gloaming, where the
scent of the old-world flowers was all about
and around them, filling the sweet night air.

Her father bore them company fora
while, but soon went in to sit with his
wife, and the two paced the lawn side by
side, with the veil of silence between them.

Adela felt too happy to talk. In the
man's mind was a drop of bitterness,
which kept him tongue-tied.

But the quietude became oppressive after
a time, and the girl touched her lover's arm,
with a smile upon her red lips.

Cecil, have you taken the vow of
silence ? "

He started.

"No; I was thinking, Adela."

Of me ? "

"Yes, of you, and of other things."

I object to the other things," she
said playfully.

So do I, my darling," he answered,
with more gravity than the occasion warranted.
" Adela, I would leave you if
I knew it to be for your happiness ; but  '

** That is what I call considerate," she
interrupted merrily.

But," he continued, " I could never
be satisfied with half a heart."

' I don't suppose you are singular in
that sentiment," she laughed. '' Even the
ingenuous young man in the song of
Kitty Tyrrel, although he sagely remarked
that one heart was enough fora
body, distinctly asks for one  a whole
one  in return for his."

** Adela, are you quite sure that my love
will make you happy ? " he said earnestly.

*' No one can be quite sure about anything.
You can make certain of two
things only  taxes and death."

Scamp, you pain me."

She turned to him with the brightness
suddenly dying out of her speaking
face.

Cecil, what is the matter ? " she
asked. " Surely you have not been
speaking to papa about me ? "

** On the contrary, he has been telling
me of the love of another for you."

Then it was very wrong of him ! " exclaimed
she indignantly. '"' No one hasa
riorht to mention such a thiner."

o o

'* And do you mind my hearing, Adela ? "

"Yes, I do."

Is that trusting me ? "

"It has nothing to do with you at all,
Cecil."

Nothing to do with me, and yet you
have promised to be my wife ! "

My dear boy, what is the matter
with you ? One would think I had accepted
Lord Carruthers and you too."

*' Adela, are you sure you care nothing
for him."

'cecil!"

My darling, at any sacrifice of self,
I would make you happy."

You seem very willing to resign me ! "
she exclaimed, in a tone of pique. " It
would be pleasant to me to hear that
you would ' hold me against the world.' "

AVould it, Adela ? Do you really
mean it ? "

*' I always mean everything I say."

Even when you are cross ? "

Then you think I can be cross ? "

Who can't ? Only an idiot can be
always the same."

Well, allowing that I can be cross 
and often am so  I do mean what I say
then, at the time, at any rate."

And, dear girl, you mean that you
love me I know now, now that you are
saying it ; but, oh ! Scamp, will it last ? "

If you have not confidence in me,
Cecil, it is not too late to confess you
cannot trust your happiness to me," she
answered gravely.

And I am to give you up to marry
Lord Carruthers ! " he said hotly.

*' If you give me up, Cecil, it will not
be for you to dictate who I shall marry,
or the reverse," she replied, with dignity.


'' Why did you not tell me you loved
him, child ? Heaven knows I would have
helped you had it been in my power 
helped you to be happy," he said, in a
low, passionate voice.

I could not tell you what is not
true. I do not love Lord Carruthers ! "

I should not have wondered if you
had ; he is a good-looking fellow ! "

Have you seen him ? " she asked
suddenly.

** Yes : this afternoon."

A smile flitted over her face. She
knew quite well that his lordship had
not been near the place ; but she let
the mistake pass, to avoid explanations
such as she had no mind to enter
upon.

Cecil," she said, " I was so happy
before dinner, and now a few foolish
words of my silly old father's have
clouded our sky. Am I not as dear to
you now as then ? There is no difference
in me, remember."

They had passed away into a sequestered
part of the garden, and were out of sight
of the house.

He caught her to his breast with hungry
love.

You can never be less, dear Adela ;
I would gladly die for you."

'* Live for me instead, Cecil," she
whispered ; " it would make me happier
by far."

Would it ? Scamp ! my life is yours
to do what you will with  only love
me, my darling. I cannot do without
your dear affection. You can never
know what the past three years have
been to me ; I was in constant dread
of some other carrying off my little
love."

I was a child," she began, but stopped,
for she felt that childhood had vanished
with his first kiss ; and whatever else the
girl was, she was truthful.

Yes ! in years ; but Adela, you were
daily getting older, and 1 knew that
lovers would be wooing you, and the
thought well-niorh maddened me."

'' Why did you not write if you felt
all that ? "

Simply from a dread lest your childish
promise, and not love, should make you
accept me  that I could not bear."

The darkness had closed them in, but

the stars twinkled overhead, and the
moon shone out with a soft light.

She raised her face to his, and let
him look into the depth of her eyes ;
then she placed her arms about his neck.

'cecil! cannot you believe in me
fully ? " she asked. " Can you not trills
me ? Without such confidence we shall
be better apart."

"I can! I do!" he cried, holding her
to his breast. '' Scamp ! I am mad when
I think any man had dared speak words
of love to you  forgive me."

That is nonsense ; all girls have offers
some time."

'' Do they ? Then men must be very
persevering, for there are six women to
every man."

Dear me ! the statistics upon the
subject must be quite interesting ! Then
a man must be refused five times to let
every girl have one offer''

What au outlook for the men I " he
laughed.

For the women, you mean, Cecil ;
it does not hurt a man to be refused."

Does it not ? I cannot agree with

you."

"Come, tell me how many offers you
have made in your thirty-eight years of
life ? " she said merrily.

None, Scamp ! I have been waiting
to find my queen, and I have found herat
last ! And now one confidence deserves
another. How many men have dared
speak to you of love, my sweet one ? "

I'm not going to confession, Cecil."

For a moment his arms unclasped from
about her.

Cecil," she said, very gravely, " do
you know that I have a great fear in
my heart to-night ? "

Once more he clasped her tightly to
him.

VOL. I. K

Have you, little love ? Cannot I
shield you from it ? "

You would have to shield me from
yourself," she returned, with a sad smile.
* Do not misjudge me, dear. I love
you with all my heart, but I could
never brook mistrust. Cecil, with all
your devotion, I fear you will yet let
your foolish fancies wreck both our
lives."

Suddenly she kissed him and clung to
him, as though the fear was a reality.

Oh ! Cecil, my love, do not ; I cannot
be answerable for myself if you
do."

My dear love," he returned, holding
her passionately to his breast  " how could
I ? If I could not believe in you, my
faith in all would be ended. Darling, let
this be our last misunderstanding."

She nestled in his breast then, and
a bird, which should have been asleep,

twittered to his mate to listen, too, to
these words of human love ; knowing,
wise bird, that both dwellers in houses
and nests, quarrel and make it up many
times before they settle down to life's
duties.

What a peaceful night ! " she said
softly ; " Cecil, I wish time would standstill."


I want you for my wife first, love ;
then let the grim scythe-bearer become
a pillar of salt or a Cleopatra's needle,"
he returned joyously.

We shall never be happier than weare
to-night, love," she said, half sadly.

Winter follows summer, we cannot
always have it bright like this. See,
already there is a black cloud rising in
the sky ! "

There is none in our horizon, darling."


Are you sure ? "

He caught her to him.

Hush ! love ! do not prophesy evil,
my darling ! I swear here, under the
arch of heaven, no other woman shall
ever be aught to me, save my one love,
my little Scamp."

She did not answer him in words, but
even in the dim light shed by the night
queen, he saw her face, and was satisfied.


CAN YOU NOT TRUST ME ? "

HE following; dav was uneventful,
and happy enough.

Cecil and Adela had many
quiet chats together, hand clasped in
hand, and all uneasiness seemed to have
left the mind of both.

There was a walk and a drive, a
breakfast and a luncheon, and once
more the dinner-bell sounded at the
Rectory.

On this occasion both Adela and
Major Egerton where dressed, and ready

to cheer Mr Tiiorndyke's heart by their
punctuality.

When the Major entered the drawing-room
he found an addition to the circle
in Lilian Freemantle.

*' I'll slip out at eight o'clock,"
whispered Adela. " and just say he's
to meet you in the lane when the clock
strikes nine, and come in again as fast
as I can. Keep my tame lion amused if
possible."

They were all laughing and talking,
and it was only when the bell of the
church tower chimed out eight, that
Adela Thorndyke remembered her promise,
and without a word she quietly
glided from the room.

Her mother looked up, but seeing her
smile, she let her go without comment,
fully satisfied that nothing was the matter.

But Adela's friend was late, and very
impatiently she waited.

Some minutes elapsed, and Mrs Thorn-dyke
signed to Lilian to accompany her
into the drawings-room.

The girl longed to fly off to the
garden to Adela, but her hostess was
in the middle of a long story about the
troubles of a family in the village, who
were in great distress, and could not
possibly be interrupted in her voluble
narration.

Not a word of it did poor Lilian hear,
but she managed to reply yes or no
occasionally, as though the subject were
full of interest to her, and all the time
her ears were stretched, listening intently
to every sound outside.

The "tame lion," left alone with the
Rector, asked him kindly to excuse him
for a minute. Jealousy was at that
moment far from his heart.

A fear possessed his mind that Adela
was ill, and he was oroing; to seek her. In

the hall he saw the parlour-maid, and inquired
where her young mistress was to
be found, and learnt that she had gone
out into the garden.

Without hesitation he followed her, and
walking across the lawn in the direction
of the tent, his footsteps gave back no
sound.

*' Don't go yet, Dela," said the voice of
a man, as he approached it.

I must, you are so rash. Suppose any
of them knew I had come out to meet
you ? Don't spoil all, and, above everything,
another time do not keep me
waiting."

I'm awfully sorry ; it was the fault
of my wretched watch, and I ran all
the way when I heard the church clock
strike."

Well, you must go out the back way ;
no one must see you here to-night. I
have left the gate of the kitchen garden

open, and I will lock the one between, so
you can wait in the lane till nine, then
sit in the old summer-house for half-an-hour.
I shall not be far off."

*shows good you are!" he said;
" what should I do without you ? I
didn't know I should have such luck
to-night, so I wrote. Perhaps you had
better take the letter now."

He drew a handful of papers from
his breast-pocket, and slipped his letter
into its envelope, then started ; for in
the weaning light Cecil Egerton was
standing: at the entrance of the tent,
looking in, his face dark and lowering.

An angry flush rose to Adela's cheeks,
but her words where firm and quiet.

Good-bye till nine o'clock, then,"
she said ; " please go."

Her visitor obeyed her without question,
and she and her lover were alone.

Adela," he said, in a voice of suppressed

passion. '' I must ask you to
explain what I have seen and heard."

She paused a moment.

*' 1 have no explanation to give," she
returned.

You came here by appointment to
receive a letter from that young man's
hands ? "

I did."

And you have promised to meet
him again at nine o'clock ? "

*' I have."

'' And you refuse to satisfy me as to
what it all means ? "

Cecil, I cannot ; the happiness of
another depends on my silence."

"Then I shall inform Mr Thorndyke
of what is going on."

Cecil, you would not, you could not,
be so  so unmanly ! You creep here,
and listen to words, and see things
never intended for your ears and eyes ;

and then you threaten to go and make
mischief ! I cannot believe it of you ! "
she cried excitedly.

"Lord Carruthers has no right to
sneak into your father's premises by
back ways, and it is as well he should
know the sort of man he is, w4iom he
so greatly desires for a son-inlaw"

A weight seemed lifted from Adelaide


"All right!" she reeked. "Go and
tell my father, if you like, that Lord
Carruthers has been talking to me in
the tent. I do not think he will mind
much," and she gazed at him defiantly ;
and you may add, if you please, that I
am oroinoj to meet him again, at nine, at
the gate in the lane. He will not interrupt
us, I'll warrant," she added bitterly.

"And this is your answer?"

I can give you no other."

A merry voice sounded in the garden.

Dela, Dela ! here's your hat, your
mother says you will catch cold ; " and
Lilian bounded into the tent.

I beg your pardon, Major Egerton,
I thought you were in the dining-room ? "
.she said apologetically.

I am going, thank you ! " he replied,
and turning upon his heel, walked away,
while burning tears fell slowly and silently
down Adela's cheeks.

Have you two quarrelled ? " asked
Lilian, in surprise.

"Quarrelled! No! Do not think
about me, Lil ; I'm all right. We will
go into the other garden and lock the
gate."

What ! now ? Some of them may be
about, and look for us."

Never mind ; I cannot go in just
yet. Horace will be somewhere near.
He will hear us if I whistle. He ought
to know the call, for lie taught it to me

so many years ago," she said, with a sad
smile.

And she was right.

Horace Lake emerged from the little
summer-house, and in another moment
Lilian was in his arms.

This is an unlooked-for pleasure my
pet!" he cried; '* I am so  so glad to see

you!"

It is all dear old Dela's doing," she
answered. " Horace, 1 should have given
you up in despair long ago but for her.
She is always ready to help us, and cheers
me by the assurance that it will all come
right. It is doubly good of her, when
the Eector has forbidden her to do anything
contrary to my father's wishes."

The roof would go off if poor old
pater were to guess that you two were
here ! " struck in Adela, with a spice of
her old fun.

"What about that very savage-looking

old, young man ? " asked Horace ; " he
won't go in and split upon us, will
he ? "

' He may inform my father that Lord
Carruthers is out here making love tome,"
she said, with a sad smile, "but that
would do you no harm."

'' Thought I was his lordship, eh ?
Well, I should not mind if I where. There
would be no difficulties with Sir Richard
then, would there, darling ? " and his
arm crept round Lilian's waist.

"Did you not undeceive him, Dela ? "
asked she.

No, dear, it is safer as it is, and now
be happy you two ; but don't stay too
long, for papa might not approve of a
lengthy interview with his lordship even,
when the darkness deepens," and she
hastily withdrew, seating herself upon a
bench to think.

Once she heard a footstep upon the

gravel in the flower-garden, and knew
that it was Cecil Egerton's, and she
longed  longed wildly to rush to him,
and tell him the simple truth, tell him
that Horace was the lover of another,
and not herself at all, that every beat of
her fond heart was for him, and for him
alone ; and he then would have taken her
to his arms, but for a very small incident.

She heard him try the gate.

A wave of anoer and india-nation
surged through her mind, driving back
the love. He was spying upon her
actions. It was a thing she would stand
from no man, she told herself, in the
strength of her pride.

So she sat still, and he passed on ; and
thus their lives where changed. Such a
very little thing will do it. A straw
upon the surface of the stream of
existence.

Horace and Lilian were very comfortable

lovers. They thoroughly understood
each other, having been like brother and
sister in childhood, before the heads of the
families thought it necessary to make
them conscious of sex by irksome restrictions.


Up to then they had been friends ;
after that they became lovers. No
sooner did they become aware that their
lives were to lie apart, than they determined
to live them together ; and
having so determined, strengthened in
their resolve by their friend Adela, they
never wavered in their allegiance to each
other.

Adela sat quite still  her mind in a
state of chaos.

Love, anger, resentment, gentleness,
and defiance, holding a battle royal.

The lovers had had their half-hour,
and considerably more, had kissed and
parted, and Lilian had locked the gate,

and was standing by her friend's side
with the key.

Where is Horace ? " she asked, coming
back to the present with an effort.

''Gone, dear ! Thank you a thousand
times, my darling old girl ; we have
had such a happy time ! "

Horace is a good fellow ; you and
he will get on splendidly, Lil ! "

'' I am sure we shall ; he is not like
the young men of the present day ! "

No ! there is nothing of the ' master '
about Horace," returned Adela, with a
smile which was sadder than tears.

Dela, darling, what has happened ?
Do tell me ; you look miserable ! "

I look what I am, Lilian, but do
not question me ! "

Can I help in no way ? You do
so much for me ! "

No ! no one can change things ; it
is fate, I suppose ! "

VOL. I. L

I never knew you fatalistic, Dela ! "

Perhaps not, but in some moods we
cannot shake it off, and can only account
for the course events have taken in one
word ! "

And that is ? "

Kismet."

Poor old girl," said Lilian softly ;
"it is of no use to talk to you to-night.
Sometimes one does not feel open to
argument ! "

You are right, and now let us go in.
How dark it has grown, and you will be
sent for before long ! It will be better
that your servant should find you in the
sheepfold, for one cannot tell a friend from
a foe in these degenerate days."

Yes one can, Dela ! Could I ever
mistake you for an enemy ? "

I ! Oh ! count for nothing ; it is
a part of my religion to be staunch to
you and Horace ! "

o

"At any cost?"

Yes ; at any cost."

Dela ! " returned Lilian earnestly,
* promise me that if ever you find helping
or shielding us may get you into
trouble, that you will turn us adrift.
I can trust Horace, even thrush I misiht
be parted from him for a time ! "

Never ! " replied Adela decidedly ;
I will never give up the friends who
have been my companions from childhood,
for any one's caprice ! "

You faithful old dear ! No one ever
had such a chum as you, Dela ! "

Adela gave her a warm hand clasp,
and the darkness hid the fact that her
red lips were quivering painfully.

Come, Lilian, we must go in," she
said, and the two girls sauntered alongside
by side, arm linked in arm. They
stopped before the French window of
the drawing-room and looked in.

A moderator iarap was casting its soft
light in the room, and it all looked
very home-like.

Mr Thorndyke had fallen asleep in his
chair. His wife was busy at work over a
small garment for one of the infantine poor.

Cecil Egerton had a book in his hand,
but his eyes were not upon its pages ;
they wore a sad, far-off look, which
could only have been born of pain, and
it went to Adela's heart.

He started as the girls stood before
the open window, but it was Mrs Thorn-dyke
who spoke.

My dears, it is very damp for you
two to be out in the garden ! "

The Eector woke with a start, 

Eh  oh  ah  yes ! What is the matter,
Mary ? "

Nothing, I hope, Edward. I was
sorry Adela and Lilian had remained
out so late  that was all."

'' Late ! Why, bless me, it is quite
dark ! "

The carriage has come for Miss Free-mantle,"
announced the parlour-maid.

Oh, you are going home in state,
are you ? " laughed Adela.

*' I would rather walk by far," asserted
the Baronet's daughter. " But papa sometimes
takes freaks into his head, and will
not allow me to do so."

Then she bade them good-bye, and Adela
went with her to the carriage door, and
watched her start, returning to family
prayer in the dining-room.

Adieux were spoken, and Mrs Thorn-dyke
and Adela went upstairs, and
after assisting; her mother, the oriel
kissed her fondly, and left for her own
room.

In the passage she met Cecil, and
stood aside to let him pass, and in so
doing she had a full view of his face.

and the misery depicted in it went to
her heart.

She laid her hand upon his arm, and
he stopped and looked at her with silent
reproach.

Cecil," she said earnestly, " can you
not trust me ? "

A great wave of feeling passed over
his face, and he stretched out his hand
to her.

"If I dared, Adela  if I dared," he
replied, in an agitated voice.

You may do so, believe me," she returned.
" The gentleman you saw is a
dear friend  nothing more ! "

He gave a deep sigh of relief, and
stood looking into the blue eyes which
met his own so honestly.

Then he stooped and kissed her, as a
father might do an erring child ; not as
though he thought her blameless, but as
though her sin against him was forgiven.

Did you tell papa ? " she asked.

No, Adela, I did not," he answered
gravely. " Although my first impulse
was to do so ! "

Second thoughts are often best," she
said approvingly. " I am glad you said
nothing to father."

Then she looked up at him in her
half-saucy way.

Are we friends again, Cecil ? "

Friends always, Adela ! "

A rosy flush suffused her fair cheeks.

I  I  did not quite mean that ! " she
said truthfully.

I understand you," he replied, with
gentle gravity. " And I must think it
out,  think whether it is for your happiness.
You have asked me to trust you,
and my own heart pleads for you, dear girl,
while my reason emphatically says ' no .' ' "

Do not listen to it, Cecil. Men
reason till they lose all faith 1 "

Yet reason was given us as a safeguard
! "

Cecil," she said gently, " you must
think me very wilful not to give you
the explanation you desire ! "

Yes, I do think you very wilful 
nay, more, very wrong ! "

I am sorry," she returned humbly.
Yet I cannot with truth and sincerity
do so."

Then it is best to be silent ! "

*' So I think. And now, Cecil, how
shall we meet tomorrow ? " and she
raised her beautiful eyes to his, full of
love.

Little siren," he murmured, drawing
her to him. " You would cajole a man's
soul out of his body ! " and again she
was nestling in his arms, free from
care.

Am I forgiven, Cecil ? "

Darling, will you assure me that no

words of love have passed between you
and that fellow ? "

'' Solemnly, I do ! "

And even though appearances are
against you, you are still my own ? "

Your very own ! "

He gathered her to him then, and
kissed her again and again.

The Rector's footsteps sounded in the
hall, and Adela fled from her lover's arms
with a liofht heart.

ADELAS REQUEST.

Delay's unhappiness and fears
had passed from her mind.
Her lover had made no mischief.


She had kept the secret of her friend,
and she had obtained her forgiveness, and
was once more in favour.

She slept the sound sleep of youth,
and a clear conscience, and did not
awake till the sun was high in the
heavens. Her first thought was of
Cecil.

She sang for joy as she dressed, because

he had chosen her, and because he
loved her ; and when she was ready she
ran downstairs with light footsteps, and
was soon among the flowers, enjoying
their sweetness.

She believed her lover to be still in
his room ; but as she passed the tent she
saw that he was there, and she went to
him at once, then stopped, for the face
which met her gaze was Cecil Egerton's
certainly, but how changed.

White to the lips, and stern beyond
description, the ghost of the man who
had pressed her to his breast only a
few hours before.

*' Cecil, in Heaven's name, what is
wrong ? " she asked, with a sudden
fear.

What is wrong ! " he repeated, almost
mechanically. " Surely it is not for you
to ask that ? You have deceived
me!"

She stood before him pale and still, a
deep passion seething in her heart.

'' How dare you make such an assertion
? " she said, in a suppressed
voice.

'' Because I can prove its truth," he
continued sternly. " Last night I allowed
your caressing ways and your bright eyes
to befool my reason. You asked me to
trust you, and I put aside all suspicions
from my mind, and lived only in your
smiles  so lived, and was happy. Today,
I know you for what you are.
Adela, you perjured yourself when you
assured me words of love were not passing
between you and your friend."

Major Egerton," she said, with pride,
although her heart was well-nioh breaking,
"I do not know upon what you
found your accusation, but you have said
enough to prove to me that I have
chosen wrongly. You are free."

She turned from him with the air of
a wounded queen, and walked away.

Stay ! " said Egerton, following her.
You shall see that my accusation is not
unjust," and he held out to her the conclusion
of a very loving love - letter.
Was that written by your friend ? "
he asked cynically.

It was, without doubt."

To whom was it addressed ? "

I cannot say."

Of course not," he returned bitterly.
Yet he was giving this very letter to
you when I came in sight last night,
and he little dreamt that he had dropped
a piece of it."

Have you anything more to say ? "
she asked.

Nothing whatever. Have you ? "

Yes ; one thing. I am innocent."

And before he could reply to her,
Adela was across the lawn, in the house,

and upstairs in her own room, with the
door locked.

She declined to appear at breakfast,
pleading a headache, and when Mrs
Thorndyke came and made her admit
her, the pale face and heavy eyes amply
convinced her of the truth of the statement.


After breakfast, she went into the
village to visit some poor folks ; and the
Eector being bound upon the same
errand, Adela did not go down at all,
until the maid came up to tell her Mr
Horace Lake was waiting to see her.

She went to him at once, for he had
said his business was urgent.

Have you not heard ? " he asked
excitedly.

** Heard what?" she queried.

"About Lilian. There was an accident
going home last night, and my dear
girl was hurt. It is all over the place.

and, Dela, I am almost wild. I dare not
go to the house to ask, and I cannot get
at the truth of it. The horses ran away,
and the carriage was all smashed up  of
that there is small doubt. Some people
say my dear girl is seriously injured 
others that she is only slightly hurt. Oh,
if I might see her ! "

I am afraid that is not possible,
Horace ; but I will go at once to Marsden
Hall, and obtain full information about
dear Lilian. If you \y\\\ hide yourself in
the little spinney at the corner of the
road, I will manage to get out, and tell
you the truth."

God bless you, Adela ! " he cried,
holding her hand unforbidden ; " you are
indeed good to me, as I have said before,
very often ; what could I do without you ? "

Neither of them had heard the door
open, but now a cold voice struck upon
their ears.

I beg your pardon. I was unaware
that the room was occupied. Mrs Thorn-dyke
informed me that you were unwell,
and were not coming down ; " and
without waiting for a reply, Major
Egerton closed the door again, and was
gone.

What a prig ! " said Horace. "One
would think he was posing for the ghost
in Hamlet."

I will dress if you will wait," she returned
; "we may as well walk together,
and oh ! how I hope we may find our
dear Lilian better."

She left the apartment as she spoke,
going wearily up the stairs.

The last straw," she moaned. " Circumstantial
evidence  link upon link. It
is all over now."

Scalding tears rose to her eyes, but she
fought against them ; choking sobs to her
throat, but she drove them back.

She looked so faint and weak when she
returned that Horace noticed it.

What's up with you, Adela ? " he said.
You look quite ill ! "

I have had no breakfast," she confessed.
I could not even look at it."

He went up to the sideboard, and poured
out a glass of wine for her.

Anxious as I am to go, I will not
start until you have taken this, and
eaten a biscuit. You will be ill if you
go on like this," he said kindly, but
firmly.

It would not matter much if I were,"
she asserted, with dim eyes. " There are
few who would miss me if I were
dead ! "

Poor old girl ! now" I know you are
out of sorts," he said decidedly. " It
was never our dear old Scamp who said
that."

And he laid his hand upon her shoulder.

VOL. I. M

She swallowed the wine to please him
as quickly as she could, and left the
house by his side, Cecil Egerton watching
her till she was out of sight, from
the window of his bedroom.

Then he turned, and very slowly collected
the things which belonged to him,
and packed his portmanteau, strapping and
locking it.

Lunch time came, but Adela did not
return.

Mrs Thorndyke went to her room, but
found the bird had flown.

Both she and the Eector had heard
rumours of Lilian Freemantle's accident,
and she rightly divined the cause of her
daughter's disappearance.

I fancy Adela must have heard that
Lilian is hurt," she said, as she joined the
others at the luncheon-table ; " she must
have gone in haste to have left no message
it is unlike her ! "

A bitter smile curled the lip of Major
Egerton. He made no remark, but he
had seen Adela depart with Lord Carruthers
(as he supposed), and had no
faith whatever in Mrs Thorndyke's
theory.

ulster the subject had been discussed as
far as it could be, a pause followed, which
he broke.

I received some news to-day, Thorn-dyke,
which calls me to town, and I
must ask you to let me take an old
friend's privilege, and run away. You
and Mrs Thorndyke must not think me
churlish for making such an abrupt departure."


"We will let you go on one condition,"
said the Eector heartily.

And that is ? "

That you come back as soon as possible.
What will x\dela say to find you flown
without even a word of farewell ? "

I cannot flatter myself that Miss Thorn-dyke
will regret the fact."

Why not ? " asked the Rector, looking
up. "Are not you and she good friends
now ? "

Certainly we are," returned the Major.

Well ! I am sorry you are going,
Egerton, very ; but it is no kindness to
press a man to remain when it has become
inconvenient to him. Eemember
there is always a vacant chair and a welcome
for you while I have a roof to
cover me. What time do you want to
go to the station ? "

"To catch the four up."

Oh ! there is plenty of time then, and
Adela may be back to say good-bye."

But she did not return, and Cecil Egerton
was carried by the four o'clock train
to London, with a strange feeling of uncertainty
as to whether he was glad to
be spared the parting, or sorry not to

take one last look at the face he loved
so well  the sweet face which had followed
him, sleeping and waking, for three
long years, and which would haunt him
still for many a weary day.

Lilian Freemantle was really ill ; so ill
that she could not bear Adela out of her
sight, although when she heard who was
waiting in the plantation, she but too
willingly spared her to carry a message
from her.

Sir Richard loved his daughter, in
spite of all his strictness with her, and
he begged Adela to let him drive over to
the Eectory for the permission of her
parents, to remain at the Hall all night,
and fetch her things  a request to which
the girl gladly consented ; and the little
pony-trap, with the Eector and Major
Egerton, was scarcely out of sight of the
Rectory gate when the Baronet drove in.

Mrs Thorndyke was glad to know for
certain where Adela had gone, willingly-put
together what she would require, and
told Sir Richard to '' keep her until Lilian
was content to part with her."

That would be never ! " laughed the
Baronet. " I have heard of hero worship
with a girl often, but this is heroine worship,
and no mistake. Lilian cannot bear
Adela out of her sight.

I think they are very fond of each
other," remarked Mrs Thorndyke, " and
Adela is very staunch in her friendships."

So I should think," replied Sir Richard.
She is the only girl I have ever liked in
my life, besides Lilian and her mother ;
there is something so open about her."

She is open as the day."

'' Well ! I had better get back," returned
the Baronet, " and make Lilian's mind easy
as to her friend's not being taken away
from her."

"Tell her with my fond love that I
hope she will very soon be quite well
again, and I am glad no bones were
broken."

No, no ! she was frightened and
shaken, poor child, and has a sprained
ankle  nothing worse, I am thankful to
say, but she is restless and feverish."

Will you kindly tell Adela that Major
Egerton has been called unexpectedly to
town, but we hope to see him back soon."

Sir Richard delivered Mrs Thorndyke's
message to her daughter, and was struck
by the girl's unusual pallor ; but after a
minute she went on talking about other
subjects, and he thought no more of it.
Not so Lilian.

"Dela," she said, "why has the Major
left Winsthorpe so suddenly."

I will tell you some day, Lil, not now.
You must keep quiet, my dear old girl ;
I want to see you better."

When you say ' not now ' in that
decided way I know there is no appeal,"
said the girl, with a smile. " What time
are you going out to meet my Horace
tomorrow ? "

"At twelve  now go to sleep."
"I will, if you will hold my hand, or
I will try."

Days had run into weeks before Adela
Thorndyke went back to the Rectory.

Lilian was more hurt than her father
supposed, and her friend scarcely left her
side, save to deliver those tender messages
in the spinney at the corner of the road.

Peggy took Mr and Mrs Thorndyke
over daily to see their daughter, and inquire
for the invalid.

They had received a short note from
Major Egerton, telling them he was starting
for the Continent to travel, in order
to recruit his health before the expiration

of his leave ; and this was all the news
of him they had to give her, and she
heard it without a sign.

Summer passed, and winter set in.
Spring, and another summer came round,
and again sped away.

A line had informed Mr Thorndyke that
Cecil had reached India, and rejoined his
regiment, and that was all.

In the damps of autumn. Sir Richard
Freemantle had contracted a severe attack
of bronchitis, and he had asked as a favour
that Adela might come to Marsden Hall,
and help Lilian to nurse him ; for he had
noticed her soothing ways, her brightness
in the sick-room, and her gentle touch,
and longed for such a nurse himself

She went without hesitation, and did
more than a daughter's part by him. The
door of death had stood ajar, and he had
looked in, and the sight had made him a
more gentle and a better man.

One day when he was convalescent, he
called Adela to his side.

Adela, my dear, come here," he said
kindly. ** I shall pull through now, I
think, and, under Providence, I consider
it due to your constant care."

And Lilian's."

Lilian is a good girl, but she is no
nurse : she has lacked experience. Adela,
I owe you a debt of gratitude  is there
any way in which I can pay it ? Anything
I can do to show you that I
appreciate all your kindness ? "

She opened her lips to say no, when a
sudden thought occurred to her, and he
caught the changed expression of her
face.

'* I see there is," he said. " Do not be
afraid to speak, my dear ; I will grant
whatever you may ask."

"Will you  will you really?" she
queried, her eyes beaming.

I have already promised," he said.

But Adela remained silent.

Why do you not speak, my dear ? '
he asked.

Simply because I am afraid," she
laughed, " afraid of my own impudence.
Sir Eichard, you know how dear Lilian is
to me ? I want to see her happy, and
there is only one thing which can make
her so. She has from childhood loved one
lad, and now that she is a woman she
loves him still. He is an open, manly
fellow, and she has his honest devotion ;
but she cannot be contented without the
consent of her father to her union with
the man she loves."

And if I do not consent ? "

I cannot say what Lilian would do,
but I can answer for myself that in such a
position  I should marry my lover the
day after I came of age," she answered,
with a flash of defiance from her bright eyes.

The corners of the Baronet's mouth save
a twitch of suppressed amusement ; but
he looked at her gravely.

"It is fortunate you are not my
daughter, young lady," he said, at length.

I am not so sure of that," she lashed.
'' I think we should have got on better
than you and Lilian do."

Oh ! you think that ? "

She nodded.

And how would you set about it ? "

I should have told you what I thought
upon all occasions."

' Indeed ! "

Lilian is afraid of you  I should not
be."

'* Oh, you would not ! " and again the
mouth was wrinkled up, and the keen
eyes shot out a spark of merriment.

No ; I am not at all in awe of you,
Sir Richard. I think you are a dear old
man, and I am sure your heart is very

kind, and soft too, if you can just peel off
the outer crust. It is that only which
is hard."

"It is strange you should have come
to that conclusion, when I have so often
been cross to you, Adela, during my illness.
Child, you have been very kind and
patient with me, and I thank you."

He stretched out his wrinkled hand to
her, and clasped her slender fingers warmly
and she, moved by a sudden impulse,
stooped and kissed his brow. A flush of
pleasure spread over his pale face.

You are a good girl, my dear ! " he
said kindly. '' The Rector has a prize in
his daughter."

A torment, you mean ; and, Sir Richard,
I am not good ! " she answered, tears rushing
to her then soft eyes. " I am wilful
and proud  oh, so proud ! " she continued
sadly.

"You are good in my eyes," he returned,.

with the old-world air of a courtier; "and
if you are proud, I admire it. I wish
Lilian were like you."

Don't ! She will make a better wife
as she is."

Perhaps ; but not a better daughter.
And now, Adela, your request ? I would
that it were a favour to yourself."

It is a favour to myself, dear Sir
Richard."

Then for yourself, is there nothing I
can do to render you brighter? The old
man has not been blind, young lady ; he
has learnt one secret."

'' And that is ? "

That his gentle nurse has some concealed
sorrow."

If it be so," she answered, with feeling,
all your nurse asks is, that you will
keep your belief concerning her locked
in your own breast. It is the only help
you can give her."

Is your trouble past the reach of aid,
my dear ? " he asked.

Utterly ! think no more of it, my
friend."

I wish I could ensure your following
the injunctions you are laying on me."

She smiled at him sadly.

Let us talk of Lilian," she suggested.

"It is strange, my dear, that you
should understand me so much better
than my own child," he said. "You have
done me good, Adela. No one has comprehended
me since I lost the wife I loved.
Why is it ?

Shall I tell you my opinion ? "

"Do."

Your pain was great, and to hide it
from the eyes of the world you enshrouded
yourself beneath a coldness which was not
natural to you. It saved you from the
suffering of having your wound probed
by kindly words, but it would have been

better had you let it bleed freely. The
wall which you built up to exclude the
sympathy which you felt you could not
bear, became your prison, almost a part
of yourself; an armour which hid your
real self from men, until the coat of mail
became known as you ; affecting even
yourself, for in life's mirror you, too, saw
the cold, hard reflection, and the thought
became fixed, ' To this I have come.' It
is the only light in which your child has
beheld you since she was old enough to
think, and the coldness has repelled her.
Put up the vizor, dear friend, and let her
see her father's love in her father's face.
Take off the iron gauntlet, and let her
feel the clasp of his warm hand. Throw
aside the breastplate, and take her to
your heart. Strip off all the cold exterior,
and let her know you for what you still
are, although you hide the fact from alla
kind, good man."

A score of expressions passed over the
Baronet's face while she spoke.

''So there is one who believes in mein
the world," he said softly. " Adela,
have you always had these thoughts concerning
me ? "

No, not always. I never thought
you so hard as other people did, but still
1 did think you so. It has only been
since I have been so much with you that
I have found you out, you dear old
man ! " she said, and passed a loving
hand over his silver hair.

Adela ! " he said with emotion, '*/
loved her so passionately ! Life seemed
a livings death when she was gone.
You cannot understand my feelings.
May you never have cause to realise
them."

Yes, I can," she answered softly ; and
their eyes met.

Poor girl ! poor girl ! then you, too,

VOL. I. N

have loved and lost. Are you sure it is
past recall ? "

"Perfectly sure."

Well ! I am indeed sorry  more than
sorry  for I owe you another debt of
gratitude. Adela ; I hope never to put
on that armour again. Sympathy, your
sympathy, has done me more good, given
me more happiness, than my years of self-elected
mental solitude. My dear, I
must live for my fellow-men once more.
T see lie would have wished it."

'* Of that I am sure, and I am very,
very glad. I am no longer afraid to ask
my favour. Do you remember the
halcyon days when your own love was
new, dear friend  when all nature spoke
lier name to you ? "

Ay ! well, well. I told her I loved
her under the scented lime trees in her
father's old Rectory grounds, and I can
still see the soft, shy, tender light in her

eyes, as they were lifted to mine full of
joy and happiness," he answered, in
agitation.

'' And I," continued Adela, " saw a lad
and a lass under an ancient walnut tree
in my father's grounds, and the two had
been told they were no longer children,
and that they must 'part. Perhaps this
very command taught them a fact which,
till then, they had scarcely realised, that
childhood was over. I left them thereto
bear their trouble as best they could."

When I returned this face was transformed,
and the light of love beamed in
her eyes.

Scamp ! " he said, " Lilian has promised
to be my wife ; no one can part us ; they
may divide us now, but her life is mine
mine hers."

And Lilian clung to me and wept.

Oh ! Dela ! " she whispered, " I am
so afraid papa may some day find out."

And if he does ? " I asked.

She shuddered.

I can't bear to think what he would
say ; he has told me that Horace and 1
must cease to be friends."

"Lilian," I replied, " tell him that
you love Horace ! " but she could not be
persuaded.

Then a bright, resolute look came into
the lad's eyes.

I will write and tell him myself,"
said Horace, " and I admired his courage.
He did write  you know what followed
? "

I do. I took his letter to his father
and told him what I thought of his son's
impudence ! "

You forgot that day under the lime
trees, my friend."

Sir Eichard shaded his eyes with his
hand, and was very still.

I did, I did ! " he said at length, as

lie looked up at his companion, and his
eyes had an unusual moisture in them.
Mr Lake and I had very high words,
and we have been enemies since that
day!"

Horace was sent off to college at once,"
continued Adela, " but not till he had
met Lilian again under the walnut tree,
and there we three made a compact
of friendship which only death can
break."

And you have helped them 1 "

I have, by every means in my power ! "

Adela ! you are a noble girl, noble

to stand by them in their trouble, and

still more noble to tell me the truth thus,

without reservation ! "

And now," she said, earnestly, ignoring
his compliment, " you will make both my
friends happy ? "

I should not wish Lilian to marry
until she has proved this young gentleman's

affection, " he said thoughtfully.
'' You see I have no other heir or heiress.
Lilian will be a wealthy woman at my
death."

Horace's love will not change. Tell
him that you will consent to Lilian's
marrying him, but that his bride will be
portionless ! "

And you think that he would still
desire the marriage ? "

Nay, I am sure he would doubly desire
it. Every true man loves to have his
wife dependent upon him ; to know that
she trusts to his manhood for all her
small needs ! "

And Lilian ? "

Would gladly give up riches for
Horace's sake ! "

Enough ! enough ! And now, Adela,
what price are you willing to pay for the
happiness of your friends ? " he asked, with
a smile.

What price ? " she repeated with a
puzzled look in her eyes.

Yes ! my doctor has ordered me to
winter abroad in future. If I consent to
this engagement will you accompany me
and Lilian ? "

Do you think papa would let me ? "
she asked.

1 am sure of it," he returned ; " he
does not like to see you look so pale,
and he will believe that the milder climate
of Mentone will cure your cough ! "

I have not much cough," she asserted,
with a smile.

You have quite enough. Adela, if
you consent, Horace shall come also.
There ! "

Do you really mean it ? " she asked,
a great gladness shining in her speaking-face.


Yes, really. What is the use of doing
things by halves ? But, Adela, all

this must be a secret between us. Will
you promise ? "

'' Certainly."

"You will not tell either of them a
word ? "

I would not deprive you of the
pleasure."

Thank you ; and now write to Horace
Lake, and tell him to call here tomorrow,
and leave the rest to me. Will that
do?"

Excellently ! I will write at once."

Are you afraid I may change my
mind ? " he laughed.

Not much ; but it seems too good to
be true ; a sort of fairy godmother business,"
she answered.

"So it is," he said softly. " Adela, it
is you who have been the good fairy ; but
for you, I fear Lilian would have continued
in her lack of happiness. Are you
glad, my dear ? "

20I

Very, very glad," she replied sprightly,
and once more kissed his sorrow - lined
brow with a gentle caress more eloquent
of her gratitude than any words.

WHAT A PEACEMAKER YOU ARE !

jS|HEN Horace Lake received the
strange and unlooked-for invitation
from Sir Richard Free-mantle,
sent by the pen of his staunch
friend Adela Thorndyke, his bewilderment
knew no bounds.

For one moment a rush of wild hope
raised a tumult in his breast. Was it
possible that Adela had really softened
the old man's heart towards him ?

The next, he was looking at the matter
critically, with a lawyer s mental eye.

Lilian's father had been more than decided
in his opinions against him ; he
had, in fact, been insulting. His pride of
race had risen up in arms against the
liberty of any young fellow iu the middle
class of society presuming to ask for his
daughter's hand. His worth mattered
little to him, his deep love still less.

Lilian was his only child, the representative
of his ancient family, and she was his
heiress ; and Horace's attentions were a
gross impertinence in his blue-blooded
mind.

No, he argued ; Adela was a wonderful
girl, with her winsome ways, half-queenly,
half-coaxing, but even she could not work
such a miracle as that.

Then it came to him that it was a piece
of fun on his friend's part. Probably the
Baronet was going away from home for a
short time, and she had thought that
Horace mio-ht venture to Marsden Hall to

see his sweetheart, and she had chosen
to word the invitation in this quaint way.
Adehi often was quaint.

There could be little doubt that this
was the explanation of the mystery. He
would even fancy Scamp stumping into
the room with Sir Eichard's massive gold-headed
stick, and could hear Lilian's
silvery laughter at her impersonation of
him, addressing: him as " Young; man ! "
And he smiled as he conjured up the
picture.

Well, he should see his darling, at any
rate. Adela was not the girl to prepare
XI disappointment for him, and he began
to count the hours which must elapse before
he should have Lilian in his arms.
But first he must scribble off a line of
thanks in reply to her letter.

My dear kind Adela,  I will be
there without fail, and sure I am that I

shall get on excellently with Sir Richard
upon this occasion. It is quite refreshed
see you Scamp still, in this work-a-day
life of toil and trouble. I shall appreciate
the fun, and even more the sight
of my dear girl.  Yours ever gratefully,

Horace."

This epistle was brought to Adela as
she sat by the Baronet's side reading to
him the following morning, as it was
obliged (so Horace thought) to pass
through the post, little dreaming it was
a sanctioned communication. A bright
glance of merriment overspread her face
as she perused it, and Sir Eichard watched
her expressive features.

Well, young lady," he said with a.
smile, " aie you going to share your fun
with me?"

"It is from Horace Lake," she answered
readily ; " and there is but little

doubt he thinks the invitation a joke on
my part."

A joke ! Eh ! How so ? " he replied
sharply.

Doubtless he imagines it is merely a
hint that the coast is clear, and that he
may come here and see Lilian."

So, lassie, you would invite a prohibited
young man here without my consent
? " he asked, with a strange mixture
of amusement and vexation upon his face.
' You would just wait till my back was
turned, and then outwit me ? "

Horace fancies so, I am sure ; but he
is wrong. I would help both him and
Lilian upon neutral ground, but I should
never dream of asking any one within
your walls whom you had forbidden to
enter there. That is my idea of loyalty
to you all."

He stretched out his hand to her.

I might have known you better, my

"dear," he said gently. " And now let
me see this young limb of the law's
letter. It may guide me in forming a
more favourable opinion of him, unless
there are secrets in it."

'there are no secrets now from yoii'
she replied, with a bright, ingenuous
look.

That is right, my dear. In future
remember I am a friend to be trusted,
not an enemy to be defeated," he said
with feeling ; and putting on his glasses
he read Horace Lake's little note. " It
is open enough," he remarked, when he
came to the end of it. " One day I may
like him perhaps ! "

Of that I am certain," she returned
warmly. "Horace is a thoroughly straightforward
fellow."

Then he is too good for a lawyer,"
said the Baronet in a dry tone, and remained
in thought. After a pause he

looked up. " Aclela, if I ever like young
Lake for his own sake he must win the
liking ; all my instincts are against him.
It is for your sake alone that I now receive
him."

And for Lilian's ! "

That, of course ; but she would not
have won my consent for herself, of that
I feel sure, much less my co-operation.
She has not your ways, my dear ; I wish
she had ! "

It is pleasant to hear one's self praised,
but Lilian is very sweet and gentle."

"Too much so; a lamb to the slaughter!
No man likes to feel himself a brute, and
Lilian has made me hold that opinion of
myself many a time and oft. It irritates
a man of my temperament; I prefer a paton
the face with your velvet paws, Miss
Pussy ! "

"Even velvet paws have concealed
natural pins," she laughed.

All the better ! You may scratch me
now and then, because then I should see
you sorry, and that wonderful light in
those sweet blue eyes ! Sunshine and
showers make April a bright month ; you
remind me of April. Lilian's sullen obedience
irritates me ; she says nothing, but
she looks a martyr ! "

And you don't admire martyrs ? "

"Not at all. I prefer live and let live
people ; martyrs are too good for an old
sinner like me ; make me feel my inferiority,
I suppose. Lilian does that ; you
do not. I feel that you are as open to
faults as 1 am. Are you affronted at my
rudeness, Adela ? "

*' Not at all ! What you say is quite
true. And now shall I go on reading ? "

No ! I am in a talking mood ; you
have said nothing to Lilian ? "

"Not a word."

That is right ; don't, my dear ! Do

VOL. I. o

you remember that tomorrow is her birthday
? She is a little younger than you
are, Adela, but not much."

Six months."

She looks older ; fair girls have
the advantage over dark ones in that
respect ! "

"All that is just a matter of opinion,
according to people's taste ; there are few
handsomer faces than Lilian's ! "

She is a regular Freemantle," he
said proudly, and then his face softened
; " but her mother was fair, very
fair 1 "

Have you no picture of her ? "

Yes, and some day I will show it to
you, Adela. I have thought it too sacred
for strange eyes to rest on ; but you
understand me, child, and so did she.
No one who does not can enter with me
into my sanctum sanatorium  not even
Lilian."

Has she not seen her mother's picture
? " asked Adela, in surprise.

No," he answered briefly ; " I could
not bear it. Lilian has no real love for
either of us. Fear and duty have been
her bonds to me, and her creed. She was
too young to remember her mother with
affection."

Do you think so ? "

Do not you ? "

No, there is a deep yearning in her
heart for the love she has never known."

Tears started to his eyes and dimmed
them.

Is that the truth % "

Yes," Adela continued softly. " Lilian
is not afraid to open her heart to me ;
and oh ! my dear friend, I Jcnow how she
longs after, and pines, for her mother's
love."

Again he shaded his eyes from her view,
and was silent.

Then he lifted up a changed and softened
face.

Adela ! what a peacemaker you are 1
I have thought my child cold and unnatural."


Lilian has the warmest of hearts."

I am glad. She shall be happy if it
be in my power to make her so ; but I
shall try both her and her lover, to find
out what metal they are made of."

Gold will stand the test of fire," she
returned, " and so will their love."

*' My child, I begin to see things
through your spectacles," he said, with
a happy look. " I hope they are not
too rosy in their tint ? "

Not so," she laughed ; " they are
the coolest pebbles, and as clear as sound
judgment can make them."

That is a good hearing for me," he
said, joining in her merriment.

'* A sound pleasant to hear," cried

Lilian, entering the room. " It makes
life in the old house, Dela, to listen
to your laughter."

And to see me join in it. Eh, my
dear ? "

"It is so ; indeed, papa, I meant
that."

Then don't hesitate to say so. Express
your opinions freely, my dear, as
Adela does."

Do you mean that ? " she asked,
with an air of bewilderment. " Dela
can say anything, and no one minds ;
it is her way, which carries off her
words. You would not like it in me
papa."

Suppose we try, Lilian ? I have
no wish to oppress you. I would
rather see you bright and happy, my
dear ! "

Tears started to her eyes, and a look
of deep wonder filled her face ; her lips

trembled, but no words issued from
them.

Adela gave her a little pinch.

*' Lilian," she whispered, " speak to
him ; encourage him to be kind."

But the girl only stammered out something
inarticulate ; she was afraid of taking
him at his word, afraid of saying the
wrong thing. They had so long been
two, that she could not comprehend his
desire for union.

A shade of disappointment crossed his
face, but Adela smiled at him.

Rome was not built in a day," she
said ; '* but what a success it was when
it was finished ! "

He pressed her hand.

Lilian," he continued, " I do not
think you and I have quite understood
each other, and the fault has been mine ;
I should have made you my study."

Oh, papa ! " filtered the girl ; *' do

not speak so, or I shall think I have
done something to displease you ! "

On the contrary, you silly girl ! " broke
in Adela. " You must think that you have
a dear, generous old father, who is ready
to take the first step to draw you nearer
to him, Lilian, and is even willing to
acknowledge that he has been in fault."

No, no ; it is I ! I cannot bear that
he should fancy that ! "

Well, let us see if we cannot do better
in the future, my dear ! You and Adela
have both been good, kind nurses, and I
am going to tell you each to ask me a
favour, and I will grant it if I can. Adela
has already made her request. Now let
me hear yours ! "

Have you, Dela ? What have you
asked ? "

That's tellinors," laughed the Rector's
daughter ; " and it is not the first time I
have had to give you that answer. From

our childhood you ever were inquisitive,
Lilian. It is like telling your wish  it
would never come true if repeated."

''Adela is right, and you may make
your request in private too, my dear, if
you like."

"Very well, I'll be off!" cried Adela.
'' A third element is a restraint ; you will
o-et on better without me ! "

It hardly seemed so, however, in this
case. Adela was the oiled feather between
these two ; and when she was gone they
came to a standstill. She found them
much where she had left them upon her
return.

The Baronet gave her such a comic
glance of despair that she knew he was
disappointed, and settled herself down with
her work by his side, with an encouraging
smile.

She had fixed four o'clock for Horace
Lake's call, and had promised Sir Eichard

that Lilian should be out at that hour ;
and now she must persuade her friend
to go.

Lily'* she half whispered ; " do you feel
very amiable to-day ? "

*'I have no sensation which tells me
that I am the reverse," she admitted,
laughingly ; "so perhaps I may truly
answer yes."

"That is all right. I thought the
dimples looked deep this morning. When
you are out of sorts they are nowhere.
They are regular barometers."

Then you always know when it will
be fair weather ? "

I flatter myself I do."

Well, what do you want me to do,
Dela ? "

To walk over to the Eectory instead
of me this afternoon. I promised to be
home to four o'clock tea, and mother will
be disappointed not to see me. So will

you go, dear old girl, as Sir Eichard wants
me to continue a subject we have begun
together ? "

** Couldn't I help papa if you want to
go home, Dela ? "

Not to-day, old lady, you couldn't
take it up in the middle ; could she. Sir
Eichard ? " she continued, with a smile.

"You shall read to me another time,
my dear," replied her father, kindly ; "but
I must have Adela this afternoon."

Lilian looked disappointed, but she
agreed at once to go out in Adela's
stead.

Chapter X.

IN THE LIONS DEN.

Punctually at four o'clock
Horace Lake rang the heavy
bell at Marsden Hall. He had
expected to see two merry faces peeping
at him from behind the window-curtains ;
but all was quiet and still as a city of
the dead.

His heart beat strongly with a strange
inter mino-lincr of feeling;.

He did not altogether like coming to
Sir Richard's house, when the old man had
forbidden his entrance there.

But Adela had bidden him come, and
he had perfect confidence in her wisdom,
so he thrust the thought aside. Still ashe
stood at the door waiting, it would
obtrude itself.

He was, moreover, in a difficulty as to
whether he was to ask for Lilian or Adela,
or to pretend he wanted to see the
Baronet. He decided against the latter
plan, considering it a needless deception.

The butler having opened the door, he
inquired whether Miss Thorndyke was
within.

The old servant had received his orders
from Sir Richard when Adela was in the
room, to admit Mr Horace Lake at once
when he called, and to usher him straightway
into his presence.

He answered, therefore, merely with a
bow, and led the way without hesitation
into the library, where no bright faces
awaited him. There was no Adela leaning

upon a massive gold-headed cane, as he had
pictured ; no quaint mimicry of the Baronet's
pompous and angry manner; no merry
laughter from Lilian, in which to join.

No Lilian at all, and no Adela ; but
there in state sat the Baronet himself, in
the depths of a large morocco-covered
easy-chair, his feet upon a stool, his knees
protected with a soft fur rug ; his elbows
resting upon the arms of his chair, and
his fingers tapping together with a somewhat
nervous and agitated movement.

Had Horace seen a ghost he could not
have looked more confused, as his eyes
met those of Sir Richard Freemantle.

He stopped short, and stood still, not
knowing whether to advance or retire ;
fearing to speak, yet feeling it impossible
to be silent.

He had been forbidden the house, and
to account for his presence there, if he
attempted explanation, he must bring

blame upon Adela, and that he would not
do.

Worse still, he must get Lilian into
trouble. And so he stood silent, his eyes
fixed upon those of the Baronet, who
thoroughly understood his dilemma, and
chuckled visibly.

Well, young gentleman," he said,
*' what are you doing in my library ? "

I beg your pardon ! " stammered
Horace, making for the door. "I have
made some mistake, I fear."

Stop ! " said the other. " Since you
are here, you are not going to get off so
easily as that. Come here ! "

Horace returned immediately.

Sit down," continued Sir Richard.

The young man obeyed him, feeling very
much like a schoolboy awaiting punishment.

And now," said the Baronet, " explain
your presence here. Have you come by
any one's invitation ? "

A flush rose to Horace's face. He
determined to speak the truth as far as it
lay in his power.

Perhaps, after all, Sir Eichard had sent
for him. Perhaps he had found out his
correspondence with Lilian.

By yours, sir, I conclude," he replied,
boldly.

Then why did you try to bolt when
you beheld me  eh, young man ? "

I really cannot explain."

Again the Baronet chuckled.

'' Caught in a trap, eh ? " and he
laughed until Horace's fears partially
melted, and he found himself joining in
his host's merriment.

Show me my invitation," insisted the
old man.

I really cannot."

You can ; it is in your pocket ! "

Horace Lake was silent.

Can you deny it ?' '

I must decline either to admit or
deny," he replied.

'' Staunch ! staunch ! " murmured the
Baronet approvingly to himself; then he
turned almost fiercely on Horace,  " Have
you obeyed my prohibitions ? " he queried.

I have never entered your house,
sir, since you forbade me to do so."

"Nor seen my daughter % Nor addressed
her by letter ? "

This is a free country. Sir Eichard,
and I have done both ! " he answered
boldly.

Oh ! you Ifiave ; and she has consented
to meet you clandestinely, and to reply
to your letters ? "

I have not said so. I have a right to
speak of my own actions, but none to
canvas those of a lady."

Not with her father ? "

Not even with her own father."

Humph ! Well, I suppose you have

got over that childish nonsense, which I
had to prohibit ? "

"No, sir, I have not got over my love
for your daughter, and never shall do
so while life lasts," replied Horace gravely,
a deep look of earnestness about his
bright blue eyes.

That is unfortunate for you  very
unfortunate  for you can never hope to
gain such a prize as the heiress of Mars-den
Hall."

*' I care nothing for the heiress of Mars-den
Hall," returned Horace proudly.
** If Lilian were a cottager s daughter,
she would be equally dear to me ; and
I tell you plainly, sir, that I will yet
win her if it be in my power."

In fact, you mean to defy me ? "

Something very like that, although 1
say it from no lack of respect for you."

"And when, may I ask, do you intend
to begin the siege upon my daughter ? "

VOL. I. P

When she is of age, and legally entitled
to guide her own actions."

Oh ! then you will allow me undisputed
possession of my own child for
two years more ! " he said mockingly.
What if I marry her to someone else
before that time elapses ? "

Lilian would never consent. She will
be true to the man who loves her, to
whom she has given her heart's affection."


You speak confidently, young man."

'' I speak as I feel. I could no more
mistrust her than I would myself."

Very well ! Then I am to understand
that if I withhold my consent, you and my
daughter mean to marry without it. May
I ask what you are going to live on ? "

*' In two years time my share of my
father's business will be five hundred
per annum ; I can keep a wife upon
that."

But not as Lilian has been accustomed
to live."

She will not object to the change,
believe me. She will be contented as the
wife of a comparatively poor man."

"You think so?"

I am sure of it ; moreover, my means
will increase ! "

Then you do not desire any allowance
from me for my daughters maintenance
\ " and Sir Eichard looked at him
keenly.

"No, sir, I shall prefer to maintain my
own ivife ; to ivory for her will make
labour sweet ! " and Horace Lake held up
his head proudly, and looked the Baronet
full in the face.

You are a bold young fellow ! "
chuckled Sir Eichard ; " and you are a
friend of Miss Thorndyke's, are you
not?"

She is the best friend I ever had ;

there is no other girl in the world to be
compared with her, except Lilian," returned
Horace warmly.

"And is not Lilian jealous of this
wonderful admiration of yours for
another % "

Horace Lake laughed.

You do not know Adela Thorndyke
as I do, or Lilian either, or you would not
ask the question ! "

"Evidently the young lady has helped
you in your love affairs ! " said the Baronet
cunningly.

"Miss Thorndyke has helped me in
all things since childhood," he replied,
evasively.

Very well turned ! Very well turned,
young gentleman ! "

** I am glad you think so. Sir Richard ! "

''I think you're honest," continued the
old man slowly, " too honest by half fora
lawyer ! "

I accept your compliment as a man,
and resent it as a solicitor," returned
Horace, with an amused smile.

*' It seems to me to make very little
difference to you and Lilian whether I
oppose her marrying you or not, since
you are both resolved to have your
own way, whether I will or no," said
the Baronet, comically.

It makes all the difference, sir."

Yes, if I were not only to consent,
but to help her in a pecuniary point of
view."

** That is not my meaning. Sir Richard.
Neither my dear girl nor I desire your
money ; it would not add to our happiness
 but your consent would do so. Let
Lilian have your blessing upon her ,
and I shall have no fear for my
darling's future."

My empty blessing ! That will content
you, eh ? "

Your earnest blessing will more than
satisfy us both."

With no hope of future favours ? "

I desire none whatever."

Adela is right," murmured the old
man, in an agitated voice. *' Horace Lake,
you are a better sort of fellow than I
took you for. I wish you well. I regret
my harsh words concerning you. You
understand fully that if Lilian becomes
your wife, I must seek another to inherit
my property ? Suppose I were
to marry again, eh, sir ? Many a
man has done it at a more advanced
age than mine."

"Many, and it would be a wise thing
for you to do, rather than be left alone,"
replied the other, approvingly.

Sir Eichard Freemantle sat up and
stretched out his hand.

I won't offer to rise ; I'm an invalid,
and I'm comfortable  the ladies spoil me ;

Mr Lake, we are friends  you comprehend
me ? "

He clasped the old man's hand eagerly.

Not quite," he replied. " Am I to understand
that you withdraw your opposition
to my suit ? If so, I need hardly tell
you that I am indeed your debtor."

You owe me nothing yet, young gentleman,
and I make no promises ; nevertheless,
I require one from you."

"Name it, sir."

Should you meet Lilian when you leave
here, I do not wish you to mention that
you have been at Marsden Hall."

Is she not aware of it then ? "

No, she has no idea of it ; Adela and
I arranged it between us."

A gleam of light shot from Horace's
eyes.

If Adela has had anything to do with
it, I thank her from my heart. Did she
gain me this interview ? "

'' You know she did, you sly fox. Did
she not write to you herself ? "

Since you are aware of the fact, I confess
it," laughed Horace.

But for Adela Thorndyke you would
never have entered my doors, young man,
so you know whom you have to thank
for it."

I am deeply grateful to her."

And if you meet Lilian ? "

** I will obey your wishes, and be
silent."

*' That is well ; and now do you knows
what tomorrow is ? "

Yes,  my dear girl's birthday."

'* Have you brought her a present ? "
asked Sir Eichard keenly.

Well, sir, I have."

Then you expected to see her today
? "

I confess I hoped to do so."

And now if you meet Lilian, you will

want to be giving her this love-gift of
yours to-night ? "

With your permission."

Then you won't get it. I wish my
own present to be the first she receives
tomorrow."

Horace's face fell.

May I be permitted to send it, or
may I call and see her ? "

You can scarcely expect that, young
gentleman. I shall only have her for two
years, you for the rest of your life, and
yet you want to poach upon my preserves
! " answered the Baronet, but there
was a smile lurking upon his lips. " It
is time for you to go," he resumed suddenly.
" Lilian will be back, and I won't
have you meet her here."

"May I call tomorrow, sir?"

Yes, you persevering rascal, call ; but
it must be at half-past eight in the morning,
and I mean to be up myself, and
VOL. I. Q

present at the interview," and Sir Richard
laughed till he nearly choked himself.

Horace looked blank, and so disconcerted,
that the other laughed more and
more.

Won't that satisfy you ? " he asked.
'then don't enter my doors again !"

It must be as you wish, sir, but you
weill not object to my giving her a letter ? "

You may give her what you please
when my own offering is made," he answered
; " but I shall expect you to keep
your word on all points, and, remember,
I am a ticklish old fellow to deal with."

If I give my word. Sir Richard, I
shall keep it," replied Horace proudly.

Well, you had better give it ! "

*' I will, sir, and trust to your kindness
to make things easier for me than they
now appear."

** Kindness ! who ever heard of kindness
from Sir Richard FreemantJe?"

Horace did not answer him, for he had
never heard even a rumour of it.

Not one polite speech, Mr Lake ? "
They are not in my line, sir."
*' Ah ! I see you think, like all the
rest, I'm a hard-hearted old man. Well,
well, of course I am, and I pride myself
on the fact, and enjoy the reputation,
and have done so these many years.
Now go, you young dog ; I'm tired of
you. To-morrow morning, at eight-thirty
punctually."

'' I'll knock as your great clock chimes."

Do so, and now good day. We have

shaken hands once, we need not trouble

to do it again. Being that bell, Mr Lake.

and my servant will show you out."

CHAPTER I.

SIR Richard S BIRTHDAY GIFT TO LILIAN.

horace LAKE was standing upon
the colossal steps of Marsden
Hall, waiting for the great

clock over the lofty archway leading to
the stables to strike the half-hour past
eight, before laying his hand upon the
mediaeval bell-pull, to summon the solemn
butler to admit him to the mansion.
But early as he was, there were two
people already in the dining-room pre-vol.

II. A

pared to receive him Sir Eichard Free-mantle
and Adela Tborndyke. The former
greeted him with an indifferent nod.

Certainly not as if he had come with
his permission, and by his invitation. But
Adela' s bright face and friendly hand-clasp
reassured him ; moreover, he noticed the
breakfast-table was laid for four.

*' You must humour all Sir Eichard's
whims," whispered Adela, and turned
aside quickly from Horace, that her host
should not see them in conversation.

And he nodded to show his comprehension
of her instructions.

You cannot see Lilian until she has
received my present," remarked Sir
Eichard at length to his matutinal visitor ;
so perhaps you will be good enough
to go behind that screen, young gentleman,
and seat yourself in the chair
there placed for you ; and I shall be
obliged by your neither moving nor

speaking until I give you permission,"
and he pointed to a fourfold Japanese
screen of black, richly embroidered in
gold, some six feet high.

Come along, Horace," said Adela, with
a bright smile. " What fun ! how delighted
our dear girl will be to see you
under her father's roof."

Am I really to understand, sir, that
you have consented to Lilian's becoming
my wife ? " asked the young lawyer, with
agitation.

Understand what you please," grumbled
the Baronet. " Old folks always have
to give way in the end."

' Thank you ! thank you a thousand
times," began Horace ; but Sir Richard
waved his thanks aside. "Go to your
chair, mr Lake ; and mind, not a word,
not a sound ! "

You shall be obeyed, sir," he replied
readily. 

"Then look out of that window all
the time, Horace," whispered Adela ;
and as she stood beside him she deftly
pinned a placard on his back unknown
to him, with the pretence of brushing
something from his coat.

Come, Sir Richard, and see if that
position will do," she laughed ; and in
another moment the Baronet was by her
side, and the chuckle which Horace had
heard several times the previous day
was audibly repeated.

Capital ! capital ! You always know
just what I want, my dear ! " he said
warmly.

The thought occurred to Horace Lake
that Adela had not much to do with
the position he had taken up, but since
it gave Lilian's father satisfaction to
think she had, the pleasant delusion
could not affect hmi in any way.

The whole transaction, however, was

very strange, and he thought Sir Richard
must be getting a little childish, to wish
him to sit behind a screen while he gave
his daughter his birthday present.

But Adela had said that he was to
be humoured, so of course he must be.
The little farce would soon be over, and
it would not hurt him at all, as he was
not invited to perform in it. If he had
been, he would gladly have taken any
part assigned to him, to draw him nearer
to Lilian, and win her father's favour ;
for although he did not doubt she would
marry him, even in defiance of his wishes,
still he knew but too well that it would
be a cloud over her happiness, to feel
that she had reached it by the paths of
disobedience.

'there is to-day's paper for you, Mr
Lake," said Sir Eichard quietly, as
though it were quite an everyday occurrence
to hide people behind screens.

"Thank you, sir, but I could not
read, I could not concentrate my
thoughts ; you forget I'm to see Lilian
presently."

Not a bit of it ; but what's the use
of wasting time ? You'll get through
the leading articles if you're a brisk
reader."

But Horace again declined the paper,
and followed Adela's instruction to lookout
of the window.

At that moment something happened
which none of them had anticipated.
Lilian's sweet voice was heard in the
distance singing " Love's Request."

"Stay with me, my darling, stay,
And like a dream thy life shall pass away."

The great gong clanged out the announcement
that breakfast was ready,
and the solemn butler noiselessly brought

in the tea and coffee, and the hot
dishes, and placed them on the table.

But instead of coming into the room,
the singer passed along the hall, and
ran out into the keen morning air, to
gather, for her own decoration, a bunch
of red chrysanthemums, and one of
white for Adela.

"Not a word, sir," whispered the
Baronet.

Don't move, old chap ! " said Adela ;
she'll be here directly."

And Horace sat looking out of the
window.

Suddenly Lilian passed.

Involuntarily he started.

All at once she glanced in, and their
eyes met.

He laid his finger upon his lips to
enjoin silence, and with a joyous
laugh the girl came dashing into the
house.

Dear old Dela ! " she murmured.
This is her surprise in honour of my
birthday ! She knows papa never appears
downstairs till one o'clock."

She rushed into the room wildly.

"You dear old girl!" she cried, clasping
her arms about her friend's neck.

"How good you are! But what would
papa say if he found out ? "

Hush ! " whispered Adela, and made
a motion with her hand towards the
further end of the room, where sat Sir
Richard, with the newspaper in his hands,
well up before his face.

Lilian uttered a cry of alarm.

"Hallo! what on earth is the matter?"
he inquired, not understanding the cause
of her agitation, and little dreaming of the
apparition she had beheld through the
window.

Nothing, papa, nothing," she answered
uneasily.

Then turning to her friend she whispered
with much agitation, 

Oh ! Dela, darling ! Cant you open
that window, and let Horace out ? It was
very kind of you ; but it was too great
a risk. Oh ! what will papa do to Horace ?
I'm sure he will horsewhip him ! "

Hush ! " returned the other ; " be quiet,
Lil."

In the meantime Sir Richard had got
himself out of the depths of his easy chair,
and was approaching his daughter somewhat
feebly, but with a kind and affectionate
smile upon his handsome old face.
And Lilian told herself that it was evident
he did not dream of her disobedience,
or that Adela had been a traitor in his
camp, and had admitted his enemy."

*' My dear child ! " he said, gently ;
you are surprised not only to see me
up, but to find me down, I am sure."

I am indeed, papa ! " she faltered.

VOL. II. B

"It is in honour of your birthday,
Lilian," he continued. "I feel I have
somewhat neglected it hitherto, and I am
going to begin a new era to-day."

No, no, papa, you have never neglected
it ! I have many kind birthday gifts of
yours ! " she replied earnestly.

A few poor trifles, but I don't remember
that I ever tried to do anything
to make the day a landmark in your life.
I never did anything to make you feel
the happier for being a year older, I
am sure."

You are very kind ! " she answered
simply.

I want to be, my dear," he said, with
feeling ; " and I have a great deal to say
to you ; but J have invited a friend to
breakfast, so I must be brief."

Oh ! papa, you will quite overture yourself
coming down so early. Shall I not
breakfast with you upstairs ? "

"No, no; you forget my friend!"

I did, I confess ! "

She glanced helplessly towards Adela,
but for once she seemed to have deserted
her, and would not meet her anxious eyes.
Never before had Lilian felt so vexed with
her.

Never before had Adela so mismanaged
everything," thought the poor girl ; and the
feeling came into her mind, that, instead of
a happy birthday, it was likely to prove
the most miserable one she had ever spent.

Before we begin breakfast, Lilian," continued
Sir Richard, with feeling, " I must
give you my offering upon this festive
occasion. Yes, my dear, I hope you will
think the phrase aptly chosen  this festive
occasion" he chuckled. " At the same
time I must confess that it has cost me a
good deal to do it,  more than you will
realise, perhaps, for I had made other
plans, I fear. But x4.dela has helped me in

the arrangement of my gift ; she knows
your tastes better than I do, so I hope you
will be satisfied, my dear. Accept it with
my affectionate love, Lilian ! You ivilljind
it behind the screen ! "

Behind the screen ! "

Poor Lilian gave an hysterical cry.

"Oh, thank you, father ; I am sure to
like it ! " she said.

But she never moved an inch.

What ! are you too lazy to look after
your own present ? I would fetch it for
you, my dear, but it is too heavy : I
couldn't lift it."

Adela was making signs to her to go
behind the screen, and her father's next
words decided her.

"My dear, we must go together if you
won't go alone."

She glanced appealingly at her friend.

Oh, stop him ! " she whispered, and
rushed forward.

In front of her sat Horace Lake, looking
out of the window, and on his back,
little as he was aware of the fact, was
a placard bearing these words ia large
letters, 

"A birthday present to my dear daughter
Lilian, from her affectionate father,

Richard Freemantle."

And the signature was in the Baronet's
own handwriting.

"Oh, papa, have you really, really given
me to Horace ? " she cried.

No, my dear ; I have given him to
you ! " said her father, with emotion, coming
to her side, and kissing her with real
feeling. " And now, young man, it is
your turn," he added, and wheeling sharply
round, he seated himself at the table.
*' Come, Adela," he said ; " we're out of
it. We may as well have our breakfast.

It is fortunate lot - water dishes have
been invented, or our cutlets would not
he eatable."

But there was a look of happiness in
his face, and a moisture in his keen eyes,
unusual to either, notwithstanding his commonplace
words.

"Lilian, my heart's darling, mine indeed
now ! " whispered Horace Lake, ashe
clasped the agitated girl to his breast.
'' Your father has been very kind, dearest;
he has put aside his own wishes, and has
consented to our union."

Oh, Horace ! can it be true ? " she
gasped.

Quite, quite true, dearest," he answered
joyously. " No more hidden meetings, no
more surreptitious letters, no more Mercury
business for dear old Scamp. We
may own our love before the world, my
darling, now. There is only one reservation
on your father's part  if you marry

me you will not be his heiress. Will
you make that sacrifice for my sake,
pet ? "

Will I not ! " she returned reassuringly.
"If I have no money, Horace,
no one can say you married me for it,
can they ? "

"No, indeed, little one. I should be
sorry if they could. How proud I shall
be to work for you, my own ! "

She looked happily up into the animated
face.

I never dreamed that papa would be
so kind," continued she at length.

Nor I. It is all dear old Scamp's
doing."

Did she coax papa into it ? "

There is not the least doubt of it."

Then I wonder no longer. Scamp could
do anything ! With her gentle, saucy ways
she would win gold from a miser, love from
a misanthrope, or charity from a parson ! "

He laughed.

What would her father say at the expression
of such an opinion, Lilian ? " asked
lier lover.

He has heard it before, Horace."

There is plenty of charity in the Rector
of Winsthorpe to count in the scale against
a number of detrimental."

There is, indeed. He is a man in a
hundred, and a parson in a thousand."

Your opinion of them is not elevated,
then ? "

No ; they preach much, and practice
little. I am glad you are not one of
them."

According to Sir Eichard's ideas, lawyers
are all rascals ! " he said amusedly.

That is very likely. I don't object to
that so much  it is their trade to make
wrong appear right ; but what I hate is
to see wrote: things done under the cloak
of religion ! "

'' There you are quite right, dear ; and
now, my pet, I want to be selfish, and
talk of ourselves. My dear girl, I do
most heartily hope this may be a bright
and happy year to you. When I bought
this," he continued, slipping a gipsy ring
set with brilliant from his waistcoat pocket,
"' I had no thought that you would be
able to wear it for the next two years ;
but now, love, I shall place it upon its
right and proper finger. We must take
it ofi" just once, dear, to put on a plain
golden fetter, and then it can go back
again for ever. You will wear it for my
sake, Lilian ? "

While life lasts," she answered
earnestly, and he once more held her in his
arms in a close embrace. "It is lovely ! "
she said brightly, looking at her ring.

And now shall I show it to papa,
Horace ? "

By all means, if you like."

Oh ! there you are ! " exclaimed Sir
Eichard, as they emerged from their
hiding-place. " I was beginning to think
you understood my invitation to be to
lunch, Mr Lake."

Have we been so very long, sir ? It
did not seem so to me."

I daresay not," and again that chuckle
was most audible.

I have to thank you for your goodness,
and Adela for her championship,"
began Horace, when the Baronet interrupted
him.

Don't you think you had better wait,
young gentleman ? Breakfast is decidedly
cold already, and I have quite finished.
Adela, my dear, I have some letters to
answer. Will you do them for me ? "

Willingly," she replied at once.

Then we will make ourselves scarce.
I won't refuse your arm, my dear, if you
like to offer it."

"Of course I like to offer it," she returned
kindly, and suited the action to
the word.

Papa ! I must tell you how grateful
I am," whispered Lilian, clinging to his
other arm.

' Dont my dear; I never could stand
thanks. The anticipation of them has
many a time prevented my doing a good
action."

Well ! I am grateful ! " she returned,
with tears of happiness in her eyes,
whether I may express my feelings or
no.

All right, my dear ; I suppose you
know your own mind."

"Indeed I do."

Ah ! so did I  so did I. Adela, my
dear, I am ready."

Oh ! papa, I must show" you my ring.
Is it not pretty ? "

Very nice, very nice. Soon got the

fetters riveted  eh! young man? Well,
well, youth is always in haste, and age is
slow ! Very odd, very odd, when one hasa
long life before him, and the other may
count it by days. I suppose I shall see
you at lunch, Mr Lake ? " he added, with
a grim smile.

Thank you very much, sir, if I may be
permitted."

If not, I should then have said plainly,
I wish you good day, young man, as
I shall not see you at lunch.' You need
never mistake my meaning unless you
choose," and the old man went off chuckling
upon Adela's arm.

"You are rather tired, are you not. Sir
Eicharcl ? " she asked kindly.

A little, my dear. But I must begin
to look up my strength for our journey
to the land of frogs."

You must, indeed."

I'll take you to Paris, my dear ;

it is the best capital in the world for
amusing yourself. You have never been
there, have you ? "

Never ; but you must get better
before you think of our pleasures ; and
now, will you rest on the sofa while I
write { "

Thank you, lassie, so I will ; I like
to watch you."

She gave him a bright glance, wrapped
him up, arranged his pillows, and set
out her writing materials, waiting for
his instructions, pen in hand.

' What shall I do without you, Adela ? "
he said thoughtfully, his eyes resting
upon her sadly. " At latest, when the
winter is over, your father will want
you back at the Eectory."

You will have Lilian," she replied
gently. " She will have learnt before
then how dear you are to each
other ! "

She will never understand my ways
as you do, my dear."

Oh ! I hope so. The light of love
will have taught her how to please
you!

'rand when she is married?"

*that will not be for two years, and
no one knows what may happen before
then ! "

You may have found a sweetheart
too  eh. Pussy ? "

The hot blood mantled her cheek, then
left her paler than before.

You are not likely to hear that," she
answered gravely, and the hand that held
the pen trembled.

Forgive me, child ! " he said earnestly.
'' I did not mean to pain you ; but you
are too young to wear the willow for
any man. You will get over it in time,
Adela ; it is not as when two lives have
grown together, and taken deep root ! "

The heart knoweth its own bitterness,"
she answered, with a sad smile.
No one can judge of the powers of
loving; or suffering of another. As for
the willow, dear friend, I do not wear
it. If I mourn, it is in spirit only. To
the world I am the same as ever, Adela
Thorndyke, the Scamp ! "

Well, well ! I wish I could make you
happy as easily as I have done Lilian. I
would if it cost me my estate, believe me ! "

"I am sure of it," she replied, with
feeling.

We managed capitally this morning,
my dear ! " he said, changing the subject
with tact.

We did, indeed ! " she answered, a
smile chasing away the clouds.

I could not Cjuite understand why
Lilian was so slow in going to look
after my gift ! " he went on, in a
puzzled way.

Adela's laughter rang out.

I daresay not," she returned ; and
then she told him how Lilian had seen
Horace from the garden, and thought he
was there without this knowledge, and
her horror, when she found both lover
and father in the same room, divided
only by a screen, and explained her
anxiety to get the one out of the
window, and the other out of the door,
back to his own chamber.

The humour of the situation suddenly
struck the old man, and he laughed till
the tears trickled down his lined face,
and Adela laughed too, as though there
was no Cecil Egerton in the world.

SIR Richard PUZZLES THE LAWYER.

whether

HEN Sir Eichard and Adela went
down to luncheon there was
no need for them to inquire
Lilian had spent a pleasant
for her face was radiantly

morning,
bright.

She and Horace had, however, really
been too long engaged, although without
parental sanction, to obtrude their feelings
upon others, when the first astonishment
and joy was over ; and only a few
fond and trustful glances told they were
lovers.

VOL. II. c

Both were in the best of spirits, and
their cheerfulness was contagious, and
soon the conversation became sparkling
and animated, and the Baronet ceased
to wonder at his daughter's choice, ashe
listened to Horace's amusing sallies,
and looked at his handsome face.

A pang of regret shot through his
mind at his want of position in the
county, but he thrust it back impatiently,
and determined to try and overcome his
aristocratic prejudices.

What are you young people going
to do this afternoon ? " he asked at
length.

Suppose you all three drive over to
the Eectory, and tell our good friends
there your little bit of news  eh !
Lilian ? "

I should like it so much, papa. I
know both Mr and Mrs Thorndyke will
be really glad, although they would not

encourage me in disobedience, " she returned,
with a smile.

As Adela did, " laughed the Baronet.

Oh ! you must not say that, papa ;
no one knows how good Dela has been
to me."

Oh yes ! he may," cried Scamp brightly.
He may say whatever he likes. It
is lie who is good, really good ; for
he has overcome himself. There is no
merit in standing by a friend."

Who helped me ? " inquired Sir
Eichard, looking at Delacour

own kind heart, " she said
softly.

He was about to deny it, when she
struck in with her sweet, imperious
way,

I worst be contradicted. Sir Eichard,
so you had better give in at once."

Very well," he answered merrily ;
but I shall punish you by staying

abroad a month longer than I meant
to do."

Abroad ! Surely you are not going
away, papa ? " asked Lilian, looking up.'

Yes, my dear. The doctor has ordered
me to leave England at once."

Oh ! papa ! I am so sorry."

'' Sorry ! "Why ? "

I shall miss you greatly," she answered,
with feeling.

'' Not a bit of it ; you are coming too.
You would not have me go alone, would
you ? "

Oh ! no, papa ! " she said hesitatingly,
with her eyes downcast and her colour
deepening. " Of course you cannot go
alone ; it was thoughtless of me to
imagine it for a moment. Indeed I shall
be very glad to go and take care of

you."

I can't say you looked very overjoyed,
my dear ! " he answered grimly.

Naturally I wish we could all have
remained here, especially now that weare
going to be so happy."

Speak for yourself, my dear, speak
for yourself. I see before me a very barren
life ! That young rascal promised me
the next two years of your society without
his interference, and he has been poaching
all the morning. Well, Lilian, tell the
truth  you don't like to leave your lover ?"

"No, papa, I don't."

"Well, I will go without you."

Not for the world. Horace can do
without me better than you can now,
father, for you are not well."

A smile of satisfaction lighted up his
face, which was reflected upon Adela's,
who gave him a glance, as much as to
say, " I told you so."

And what do you say to the arrangement,
young gentleman ? " demanded the
Baronet, turning suddenly upon Horace.

Lilian has given the right decision,
sir," he replied ; " she must certainly accompany
you."

The smile deepened.

"You two will want to write love-letters
to each other, I suppose." he
remarked, with a wicked twinkle in his
eyes. " I conclude I must consent to it
once a month or so ! "

A little oftener than that I hope,
sir," pleaded Horace.

Never satisfied ! " he laughed. " Well,
I must see ! I'll think about it. Lake."

Then he turned to Lilian.

We must coax the Eector to let
Adela accompany us, my dear ; we could
not do without her yet, could we ? "

Oh ! Dela, I am more than glad.
If only Horace were going too, how I
should enjoy it ! "

And a silence followed her remark.

Two of them knew that he was to go.

but the Baronet liked to let out his
favours in surprises, and Adela had no
mind to thwart his whim.

Lilian's wish was expressed upon the
impulse of the moment, with no thought
of the possibility of such a scheme.

Horace gave her a grateful glance, but
shook his head.

How would my work get on, little
one ? No, there must be no pleasure-making
for me for the next two years,"
he answered, in a very low voice ; " then
I will take my dear girl abroad myself, and
how I shall enjoy it ! "

Their eyes met, and their hands met
furtively, too, under the table.

I have communicated with the Eector
on the subject, and all you have to do
this afternoon is to bring; me his consent
to Adela's accompanying us," said the
Baronet.

"We will not both leave you," said

Adela hastily ; " let Lilian and Horace go
over together, dear Sir Eichard."

Without a chaperon ! Impossible.
No, my dear girl, you must do Gooseberry,
and I'll take a nap. By-the-bye,
bring the Rector and his good wife back
to dinner."

That hould be nice ! " replied Adela
warmly.

"And tell them the carriage shall take
them home in the evening."

How thoughtful you are ! "

"Am I? Then I must have learnt the
trick of you, missy," he laughed. "Now,
girls, go and dress. Suppose you help
me upstairs. Master Horace. I think
your hair will want smoothing before you
appear in respectable society. Have you
looked at yourself in the glass lately ? "

Not since I made it all stand on end
as far as I could," laughed Lilian ; " but it
is so curly, and I cannot succeed very well."

OJ

What things you girls are ! " grumbled
Sir Richard. " What a way to show
your affection for a man, to try and
make his hair stand on end ! One would
think you wanted him for a bottle
brush ! Go on, the pair of you, or Adela
will be tr3dng her pranks on me to keep
you in countenance."

And as he spoke he took Horace by the
arm, and led him from the room.

Well ! " he said, when they were
alone, " Lilian's birthday only comes once
a year. I suppose you want to stay to
dinner. I'll send over for your clothes."

That is indeed kind of you, sir. With
your permission I will write a note to
my mother, and tell her what to jack
up for me. They do not even know
where I am to-day."

Bad son ! bad son ! " returned the old
man, with pretended deprecation.

I left a message to say I could not

tell when I should be back," continued
Horace.

Oh ! of course, of course ! Trying to
take off the unfavourable impression, eh ? "

Horace laughed.

Well, sir, I cannot pretend to desire
your ttTzfavourable opinion," he admitted.


Well, then, make my child happy,"
said Sir Eichard gravely, " and you
will deserve my good one."

It shall not be my fault, sir, if
sorrow reaches my dear girl. I will
shield her from it, Heaven helping me,"
he replied earnestly.

In silence Sir Eichard clasped the young
man's hand.

May He bless you in your endeavour,"
he answered brokenly, after a pause.
May Lilian be as dear to you as her
mother was to me."

Then he turned from him abruptly,

and Horace went out with quiet steps,
and left him alone.

When Adela and Lilian came in to
say " Good-bye," they found him very
still.

Send Harvey to me, Lilian," he said,
and his valet entered the room as they
went downstairs.

I am going to write a note," he
asserted. " Order the dogcart round,
and when it is prepared, you are to
come back to me for instructions. Just
ask Mr Lake if his letter is ready before
he starts."

The man found it already in the hands
of the butler, and informed his master
of the fact, also that the trap was at
the door, a quarter of an hour later.

*' Very well, take this note and Mr
Lake's ; leave the latter at Mr Lake's
house, and say you will return for Mr
Horace's bag. Then drive on to the

office, and bring Mr Lake back with you,
after giving him my letter. Remember
you are not to return without him, and
you are to call for the bag on your way.
Do you understand ? "

'' Perfectly, Sir Richard."

Tell the groom to drive quickly, I
want to see Mr Lake as soon as possible."


I beg your pardon, sir, I hope you
are not feeling worse," began the man
anxiously.

Don't trouble yourself, Harvey ; my
will was made iona; ao-o, if I make
another it won't be in a hurry."

No offence, sir, I hope. I humbly
beg your pardon."

Don't waste time, man, go at once."

The valet withdrew with a respectful
bow, and in less than five minutes Sir
Richard was asleep.

Great indeed was the astonishment at

Mr Lake's residence, when the Baronet's
dogcart dashed up to the door, and
Horace's note was placed in his mother's
hand.

Dear Mummy," it ran,  " Send me
over all my dinner toggery in my small
portmanteau by the bearer, please. 1
have so much to tell you, but it must
keep till we meet. One thing, however,
I must say, and that is, there never was
a happier fellow than your loving son,

'' Horace."

Mrs Lake sat looking at the lines in
bewilderment.

What did it all mean ?

There never was a happier fellow than
her son Horace !

Her motherly heart gave a great bound
of gladness, for there had been moments-when
her boy's bright and handsome
face had been sad indeed.

The young man said he would be
back for the bag in a few minutes,"
ventured the abigail.

Mrs Lake started.

Of course, Fanny, I will select the
things at once," and she did so, her
mind still upon her son's words.

Mr Lake was perfectly aware that he
and Sir Eichard Freemantle were tito,
both as friends and acquaintances, as
well as in a business point of view.

He had managed a good many matters
for him in days gone by, before Horace
had presumed to love his daughter, but
that time was over, and no communication
had passed between the Hall and
the solicitor's house or office since.

He was therefore bewildered to hear
that Sir Richard Freemantle's dogcart
was waiting to convey him to Marsden
Hall, with the request that he would
kindly start as soon as possible.

Moreover a note was placed in his hand,
written by the Baronet himself.

Sir Richard Freeman tie presents his
compliments to Mr Lake, and will be
obliged by his coming to see him at once,
upon pressing business."

The lawyer called for his hat and overcoat.
The Baronet was not a client to be
kept waiting.

It was evident he was to receive some
instructions, possibly to be taken into
favour again, and the law management
of the Marsden Hall estates was worth
having.

So Mr Lake went willingly, and withall
speed.

He had not forgotten Sir Richard's
bitter words to him, but he could afford
to put them aside, if it were to his advantage
to do so.

He looked surprised when the dogcart
stopped at his house, and the valet sprang

down from the back seat to ring the belL
His own maid quickly answered it, with
his son's small portmanteau in her
hand.

*' Misses says can you come in and speak
to her, sir ? " she asked.

'' Not now, Fanny, but I shall soon
be home, tell Mrs Lake. Where is that
going ? "

Please, sir, I don't know ; this gentleman
said he would call for it."

And she pointed to Harvey the valet.

I am following Sir Eichard's instructions,"
replied the man.

And slipping the portmanteau under the
seat, he again jumped up.

The high-mettled horse dashed forward
at a brisk trot, and in a very few minutes
they had left the town, and had traversed
the intervening two miles which divided
them from Marsden Hall.

Sir Eichard was still asleep when Harvey

opened the door, entering the room
with the solicitor behind him.

Hullo ! wouldn't come, you say ! " lie
cried, starting up.

Mr Lake is here, sir," returned the
man.

And that personage stepped forward,
while the valet retired.

You don't often catch me napping, Mr
Lake," said the Baronet, with a grim smile.
I have been an invalid lately, so I must
be excused."

Certainly," began the other politely,
a siesta in the afternoon is often very
refreshing. I am sorry you have been
in ill-health. We have not met for sometime."


No, not since your young rascal of a
son chose to make love to my daughter,
and what's more, sir, he's at it still, at
this very moment ! "

Mr Lake's hopes went down.

VOL. II. D

Instead of being reinstated as the Baronet's
man of business, had he been sent
for to hear again of Horace's enormities \
It seemed very like it.

"It is a matter of regret to me, Sir
Eichard, that my son should do anything
to annoy you. My only excuse for him
is. that I am sure he and the young
lady are sincerely attached to each other;
but believe me, I do nothing to encourage
it ; on the contrary, I (encourage
it ! "

Then why not send the rogue abroad
for a time ? " he asked sharply.

Impossible 1 I could not afford it,
sir."

Tut  tut  that shall not stand in his
way. Look here, Lake, I have a little
business to be done at Mentone ; let the
lad go there for the winter months."

But, sir, I should have to engage
another clerk in his place."

"Yes, jyvo tern., and you can charge
his salary in my bill, also that of Master

Horace ; the two combined won't ruin

>>
me.

I don't like to decide without speaking
to my son : he may not wish to go."

"Give him the chance," chuckled the
Baronet ; " if he says no, let there be an
end of the matter."

You cannot speak more handsomely
than that, Sir Richard," returned Mr Lake
warmly. "Horace ought to consider himself
a lucky fellow to have the opportunity
of getting such a trip. You specified
Mentone, I think, as his place of
residence ! "

I did, but I have no objection to his
having a look at Paris on his way there
not a bit  I should like to do so myself
were I in his place."

You are very kind, sir ; and may I
ask whether you hope that absence will

shake the faith of our children towards
each other, for if you propose the arrangement
with any such expectations, I
think it is only fair to tell you that I do
not believe my son Horace will ever
change in his affection for Miss Lilian. For
the rest, though I shall miss him very
much, I should like him to accept your
offer. He has fretted a great deal, and
the change would do him good ; only it
would not be honourable in me to hold
out aDy hope that he will give up his suit
upon his return."

'' We will see, we will see," replied the
baronet, with a merry twinkle in his eye,
which the man of law failed to understand.


'* You will throw no difficulties, then,
in the way of the boy's going ? "

'' None whatever."

** And when can he start ? "

As soon as he will."

"Tut  tut  young people must let
their elders settle things for them sometimes
; we will say this day week."

If Horace agrees to the arrangement,
most certainly ; but I fear he may not
like to leave the neighbourhood which
holds the girl he loves."

'' Romance, no thing: hut romance."

Very likely, Sir Richard, but most of
us have gone through the phase ourselves,
so we must look leniently on these ideas
of the young ones."

Yes, yes, we have all passed through
it if we have hearts at all," murmured
the old man. " And now, Mr Lake, as
we have been friendly over this matter,
let us try and work together."

No one could desire it more than I
do. Sir Richard. I am truly sorry any
folly of my boy's should have caused you
annoyance, but I was powerless to influence
him."

Well, well, all the better ; a young
man who can't think and act for himself,
is not worth much. Suppose you bring
Mrs Lake to dinner here to-night, to meet
the Eector and his wife ? This is my
daughter's birthday, and we may as well
have a little merry-making."

Mr Lake looked at the baronet in surprise.


It would be quite like old times,"
he said hastily, "and Mrs Lake will be
highly honoured."

Then that is settled."

Thank you, and if I can get hold of
Horace, I will sound him about this scheme
of yours, Sir Eichard, and let you know
what he says."

All right ; we dine at seven. Come
at half-past six, and you can have a talk
with the lad before dinner."

Mr Lake began to think his sometime
client was getting a little childish, and the

old man was sharp enough to catch this
thought in his eye.

Oh ! I forgot to tell you Master
Horace will be one of the party," he
laughed. " I have asked him to dinner
to-night. Even condemned criminals are
allowed to say good-bye to their friends,
Mr Lake, and I could not be hard on
the boy. As you reminded me just now,
ive were young once, and lovers into the
bargain."

The lawyer began to feel more than
ever puzzled ; his mind was so chaotic, he
was quite unable to form an opinion upon
Sir Richard's seemingly inconsistent conduct.
That he should be willing to pay
some hundreds of pounds to get rid of a
detrimental admirer of his daughter's, and
yet so tender of his feelings as to invite
him to dinner, to give him the opportunity
of saying farewell to the prohibited young
lady, were things totally past his comprehension

; and very serious fears set in, in
his fancy, as to the state of the Baronet's
intellect.

Is there anything I can do for you
legally, Sir Eichard, before I go ? " he
asked gravely, " or did you send forme
merely to make this proposition, or
to give us your kind invitation in person
? "

"There is nothing more just now,
Lake. We will see how you manage
matters with your son," he added cheerily.
If you are successful in your persuasions,
there will be a great deal for you
to look after this winter, for I may be
away myself."

Mr Lake looked at him in pity.

Here was Sir Eichard wanting to banish
Horace, that he might not meet his
daughter, and after all he was going away
himself. Then a sudden light broke upon
the subject. If Lilian was to be left at

home alone, there was perhaps some sense
in the Baronet's precaution.

Is not your daughter to accompany
you, sir ? " he inquired, after a pause.

"That is just as she pleases, Lake; it is
the best way to let young people choose
for themselves, after all."

"And you do not think she will go?"

I never said so."

You had better not let my son have a
hint of this. Sir Richard."

'Why?"

"Because he is but human. If Miss
Lilian remains here, with no one to protect
her from his attentions, is he likely to
cease them when she receives them
willingly ? "

The Baronet chuckled.

Lawyers are accustomed to have hard
nuts to crack, I suppose, Lake. You
must do the best you can with the
rascal ; and now had you not better go,

or Mrs Lake may make other arrangements
? "

"Just so," he replied, well aware that
there would be quite a little domestic commotion
on his wife's part at the unexpected
invitation, and no end of excitement
in the choosing of caps and frills,
gloves and laces, for the occasion, and he
rose at once.

Sir Eichard extended his hand.

*' Don't forget, be here at half-past six
dinner will be at seven, then while you
are talking to that young rascal of yours,
the ladies can tell each other their secrets ;
it's wonderful how many they find to
relate when they get together. For me, if
I have one, I keep it to myself Once
told, you never know where it may travel.
I don't believe in confidants ! "

It would not do for my clients all to
hold your opinions, Sir Richard. Solicitors,
like doctors, ought to know the

whole of a case if their services are to be
of any avail ; and in both of our professions
we are bound in honour not to
reveal what is confided to us."

In honour, yes ! but the article is
scarce. A secret is no longer a secret if
even your lawyer knows it."

You have not a very high opinion
of"

Of any one,' struck in the Baronet ;
*' all men are ready to look out for their
own interests."

And who would, if they did not ? "

Exactly so. It is every man for
himself in this battle of life, and his neighbour,
if needs be, for a stepping-stone !

'Tis true, 'tis pity ; pity 'tis, 'tis true ! '

And now Mr Lake, take my dogcart and
make use of it ; keep it to return in, if
madame be not afraid to mount so
hiiih."

o

u """ITY OP

** She will not object at all, I am
sure."

'rand the close carriage can leave you
as it takes the Rector and his wife home
at night. It holds four."

"Thank you, thank you very much."

Sir Richard had once more tucked his
legs up on the sofa, and now he laid his
head back on the pillow and closed his
eyes.

"Good-bye," said Mr Lake.

*' Eh ! why, you're coming back, are you
not ? " asked the Baronet irritably.

"Thank you, yes; then ' au

revoir

/"

Oh certainly, au revoir by all means,
my good fellow," returned the other,
closing his eyes with utter indifference.
You know the way ? or touch the
bell."

Thanks, I know my way very well ;
it is not the first time I have visited
you in your room by many."

*' Of course not, before that rascal  "
began the Baronet, but Mr Lake wouldn't
stop for another outbreak against his
son, and was quietly closing the door.

Long-winded fellows those lawyers,"
grumbled Sir Richard, as he turned on
his side. "I've puzzled him anyway, 
given him an enigma to work at, which
will take him the rest of the afternoon,
and then he will not find the answer
without help. I've a great mind to tell
that young dog the joke, and make him
vow that nothing shall take him from
the vicinity of Marsden Hall. Then I
could storm at his father for an hour."
And the old man chuckled till he fell
asleep.

i

THE MYSTERY SOLVED.

[EVER knew any one so verbose,"
thought Mr Lake, as he went
slowly down the stairs, " and
his mental tiles are getting very shaky.
How changed from twenty-five years ago,
when he brought home his sweet young
wife, who worshipped him, although he
was twice her age ! He was forty then,
and how old he looks now ; but he
cannot be more than sixty-five, aged ashe
looks. He is wearing badly. I am
only his junior by ten years, and I'm a

boy compared to him. Poor Sir Billiard !
What does it all mean ? "

Is the trap to take you home, sir ? "
asked the butler.

Yes ! and to wait and bring me
and Mrs Lake back again," returned the
solicitor, with importance. '' I'm sorry to
ive so much trouble."

Not at all, sir," replied the man
politely ; and passing out at the door
he went to the groom who was in charge
of the vehicle, and spoke to him in a
low voice.

I'd better take the horse to the
hotel if I have to wait," answered the
groom. " All right."

Then Mr Lake jumped up, and was
whirled along homeward, with a very
preoccupied mind.

** Sir Eichard does not seem himself

at all," he said to the groom suddenly.

No, sir, he's very much pulled down.

The hroivnkitis is a very weakening thing,"
replied the man gravely.

Yes ! illness weakens mind and body,"
suggested the lawyer.

It do, sir, but Sir Eichard's mind is
as clear as crystal. He is going away,
you know, sir, and he had me in yesterday
to give me his orders respecting the
'horses during his absence. Nothing was
forgotten, ill as he has been ; and I was
shocked to see him look so thin and white."

Ah ! " replied Mr Lake, and relapsed
into silence, feeling more puzzled than
before.

Mrs Lake was watching at the window
for her husband's arrival, not at all displeased
that the outside world should
see the good man seated in state in the
baronet's handsome trap.

Humours had crept about of the
quarrel between the owner of Marsden
Hall and his solicitor.

People had assigned many reasons for
it, but the real reason was known only
to a few, if guessed by many, for neither
the Freemantles nor the Lakes had desired
to make the affair the talk of the small
town.

The split had been commented upon,
was a little nine days' wonder, and now
appeared to be forgotten.

Mrs Lake ran to the door to admit her
husband.

Are you going back, sir ? " inquired
the groom.

Thank you, we are to be at the Hall
at six-thirty. We had better start at
a quarter past, I suppose ? "

The man touched his hat, and laid his
whip gently over the horse's back, and
drove to the nearest hotel.

What's up, I wonder ? " he said to
himself as he turned into the stable-yard.

Mrs Lake's query was of the same nature,

VOL. II. E

if not couched in exactly the same language.


Well, Henry," she asked, with an intent
look, " have you good news ? "

He walked into the sitting-room, and >
closed the door.

'' I'm blessed if I know," he admitted.
*' Sir Richard seems to me to be decidedly
cracked, but that groom of his
asserts that he is perfectly clear-headed."

You didn't ask such a question, surely ? "

"Is it likely ? One can find out a thing
without asking ; most people can be
pumped / "

Why were you sent for ? "

"To invite you and me to dinner, my
dear ! " he answered, with a smile.

'' Us to dinner ! " exclaimed the lady,
with evident pleasure. " Well, I am
glad. There is nothing cracked about that,
Henry ; he wishes to be friends again."

Just so, but why ? It cannot advantage

}iim in any way, and he has invited
Horace too ! "

Invited Horace ! Then that is what
his note to me meant. Henry, depend
upon it you weill see our boy the Baronet's
son-in-law yet ! " she cried excitedly.

*' Nonsense, my dear ! You women are
always off at a tangent about something.
Sir Eichard is so anxious to get rid of
the lad that he has decided to send
him for the winter to Mentone on
some pretended business. The scheme
will cost him a cool five hundred ! "

"Well, he can afford it!"

I daresay ; but where is your dream
picture  eh, wife ? "

Mrs Lake looked crestfallen.

I don't understand. What is his
object in wanting to send Horace
away ? "

Goodness knows, unless he thinks
Lord Carruthers is after his daughter.

I hear he has been a good deal at
the Hall lately."

Does Horace know it ? " asked Mrs
Lake sharply.

How can I tell what the lad knows
or does not ? He is not a boy to talk.
My dear, you had better go and lookout
your finery ; for one thing is certain,
at any rate  we are to be at the Hall
at half-past six."

*' I would have had a new dress if I
had only known," said the good woman,
with an air of regret. " We so seldom
go out in this little place, and when
we do, our things are good enough for
our company. But I should have wished
to look well to-night for Horace's sake.
I should not like him to be ashamed of
us ; and, my dear, your dress coat is so
rusty, you really must order another."

In case Sir Eichard should honour us
again, eh?" laughed Mr Lake. "Well,

my dear, we had better wait, and see
whether I get the estate work to do as
of yore ; if not, I should not feel justified
in obliging you till the boys are
out in life. As to Horace, he would
never be ashamed of his father and
mother, if they appeared in rags and
tatters ! "

Bless the boy ! " replied his wife,
with tears in her eyes, "you are right,
Henry, he never would," and she ran off
upstairs to dress, contentedly arraying
herself in her well-worn evening costume.

Punctually at half - past six the dogcart
drew up before the hall-door at
Marsden, and the butler showed Mr
and Mrs Lake into the drawing-room,
where they found a merry party already
assembled.

Lake, I am very glad it is all right,"
said the Eector of Winsthorpe, in a low

voice, giving him a friendly grasp of the
hand.

Thank you, thank you ! " returned the
other, not at all certain upon what he
was being congratulated, and passed onto
greet the rest of the guests.

Lilian, my dear, Mrs Lake will like
to take off her bonnet if you will conduct
her upstairs ; and you, young gentleman,
can show your father into my
room," ended Sir Eichard, turning to
Horace.

Then, as they left the apartment in
pairs, he looked at Adelaide

had turned it over again and
again in his mind as to what the girl's
trouble could be ; and having come to
the conclusion that it could not possibly
be anything but a love affair, set his
wits to work to unravel the mystery
of whom it could be that she cared for
in secret : and he could find no one

worthy of such au attachment in the
neighbourhood but Lord Carruthers.

Under this impression he had been
unusually friendly towards the young
nobleman, and had given him a \varm
welcome whenever he had put in an
appearance at the Hall.

Adela, I have another guest coming
this evening," he said suddenly.

Indeed ! what a pity ! we were just
eight. How naughty of you, Sir Eichard ! "

Well, my dear, I don't often entertain,
and I shall not have the chance
of doing it again for some time, so you
must forgive me this once. I have
long wanted to ask Lord Carruthers to
dinner."

Adela coloured, but made no reply,
and the old man thought he had found
out her secret.

Mr Thorndyke, who had heard the
conversation, struck in warmly, 

1, at any rate, am glad he is coming.
Oarruthers is a great favourite of mine,
and is always a welcome guest at my
house."

Well ! I am pleased that some one
is satisfied," he laughed ; " and now what
about Miss Pussy here ? Her cough is
still troublesome, and Mentone will set
her up, to say nothing of my selfish
desire to have her with us. You won't
say no, will you, Rector ? "

She has been a long while away
from home," returned her father, " and
her mother and I miss her sadly, but
we do not think it would be right in
us to consider our own feelings before
her good. Do you want to go,
Adela ? "

She lifted her eyes to his, full of
deep affection, and her hand crept into
his.

My feelings are too mixed to analyse,"

she replied ; " you shall decide for me,
father."

There was a pause, and Mr Thorndyke
sat looking upon the ground, wrapped
in deep thought.

You shall go, darling," he said, at
length, ** and may the journey be for
your good, as well as that of your
friends."

Sir Eichard flung up his velvet cap
like a schoolboy, in the excitement of
his satisfaction.

My dear," he said, " I will show
you the world. You shall enjoy the
trip, if it rests with me."

She has not seen much of it, sofar,
poor child. Winsthorpe is a somewhat
out - of - the - way place for young
people, and of late I have felt no inclination
for going about : the change
will brighten her up."

I am bright enough, papa," she

laughed, but there was a wistful lookin
her beautiful eyes.

By-the-bye, Adela, your father heard
from an old friend of yours to-day,"
said her mother.

''To be sure," struck in the Eector,
'' from Egerton. He says his uncle  Lord
Limestone, you know  is in a very shaky
state, and wants him to come home
and see him, and has offered to pay
his expenses if he can get leave to do
so ; so we may have a visit from him
in your absence, Scamp, to cheer us
up."

Sir Eichard knew nothing of Major
Egerton, and taking no interest in the
conversation, was talking to Mrs Thorn -
dyke about the arrangement for the projected
trip, and failed to see the pallor
grow upon Adela's cheek.

Her first feeling was a sense of wild
disappointment that should Cecil revisit

Winsthorpe, she should not be there to
welcome him.

Her second was one of deep relief
that she should be spared the meeting;.


Not only had he left her, and misjudged
her in his passionate anger and
jealousy, but he had not once sent hera
kindly word since he had been away,
when that anger must have cooled, when
his sense and judgment should have
spoken in her favour.

Pity the old man married," continued
the Eector ; " had he not done so, Cecil
would have had a fine property. As
it is, Lord Limestone wishes him to
undertake the guardianship of his sod,
from the age of twelve to eighteen,
personally ; and it is about this he is
desirous to see him. Before then he
is to remain under his mother's care.
Egerton says he will come home if he

jan, but that he shall only be in England
 few days."

Where is Lord Limestone living ? "
asked Adela, for the sake of something
to say.

His estate is in Derbyshire, and the
scenery around is the most beautiful
which England can produce. We might
have had a peep at it had the place
fallen into Cecil's hands ; but he does
not say a word as to whether his uncle
is at home, or health-seeking elsewhere."

At home, I should fancy, if he is
so feeble," said Adela thoughtfully.

And at that moment Lord Carruthers
was announced.

He looked such a perfect gentleman ashe
entered the room in his evening
clothes, and so handsome, that Adela
glanced at him in surprise.

Often as she had seen him she had
never been struck by his appearance as

she now was, and the greetings over, he
secured the vacant seat by her side, and
held it in possession.

In the meantime Lilian had thrown
her arms round the neck of Horace's
mother, and had burst into joyous
tears.

''My dear, what is it?" inquired Mrs
Lake, holding her to her breast, and
patting her back, as though she were
soothing an infant.

*' Nothing indeed, only I am so happy,
and so is Horace," she answered, smiling
through her tears. " Papa has been so
kind ! Oh ! dear Mrs Lake, he has really
consented to our being married in two
years' time ! "

*' Then no wonder the boy wrote me
such a bright note ! " returned Mrs Lake,
her face like a sunbeam.

One thing may disappoint you and
Mr Lake, perhaps," continued the girl

shyly. *' I am not to inherit papa's
property or money, but of that Horace
says he is rather glad than otherwise ;
he would not like to be dependent upon
his wife."

And quite right too ; I admire his
spirit. I had not a sixpence when his
father married 7?ie, and no couple could
be happier than we have been ; but it
will be a change for you, my dear, to
live on his means."

"Do you think I shall mind that?"
-asked Lilian softly.

Not if you love him truly."

"I do love him with all my heart,"
she answered, with her bright eyes looking
straight into those of Horace's mother.
''\ do love him, and I want you to try
and care for me for his sake."

It won't be very difficult, my dear ;
I was fond of you as a child. Of late
years we have not seen each other, but

I have thought kindly of you because
you were true to my boy. Yes, dear,
I can, and do, and will love you," she
answered warmly.

Thank you very much," returned the
girl, in a low voice. " I never had the
comfort of a mother's love ; I was so
young when she died, and I have so
often longed for her gentle guidance."

You will have Horace to guide you
now, darling," said Mrs Lake, smoothing
the soft dark hair from her brow ; " and
1 will be a mother to you, Lilian, if
you will let me," and they sealed the
compact with a kiss of sincere affection.


While this conversation was being
carried on in Lilian's room, another was
in progress in Sir Eichard's bed-chamber,
between Mr Lake and his son.

This is an unexpected surprise to see

you and my mother here, father," said
Horace, his handsome face aglow with
pleasure.

" Just so, my boy ; no one could have
been more taken aback than I was when
the Baronet sent for me this afternoon."


What ! have you been here before
to-day ? Then I suppose you know all
about everything ? "

'' I conclude I do."

And what do you think of it \ "

Well, my opinion, in confidence, is,
that the Baronet is cr ached r

Horace looked at his father blankly.

Have you heard of his scheme to get
rid of you f "

To get rid of me ? " echoed the son.

Yes ! he is willing to spend at least
five hundred pounds for his whim."

Horace Lake turned pale.

The gladness died out of his face, and he

sat down as though all the strength had
gone out of him.

Go on," he said, much agitated. '' Let
me hear all."

Why, the long and the short of it is,
that he wants to get you out of the way
for the winter. I have an idea that he
wishes to clear the coast for some one else,
and thinks if Lilian does not see you, that
she will forget you."

Lilian forget me ! " retorted Horace
scornfully. " Never ! "

'* Well, I can account for his proceedings
in no other way. He is willing to pay all
expenses if you will ship yourself off
to do some pretended business for him
abroad."

"But what is his object? He starts
himself this day week."

The deuce he does ! That is the day
he said you were to go. Does Miss Lilian
accompany him ? "

VOL. II. F

Certainly, and Adela Thorndyke too."

Then he must be mad ! "

Heaven forbid, for Lilian's sake ! And
where am I to go ? " asked Horace suddenly.


Well, queer as the offer is, I should
not refuse it if I were you, Horace. You
have looked harassed of late, and it will
secure you a long rest and a pleasant
winter. He wishes you to go to Mentone
for some months, but he has no objection
to your visiting Paris on your way, and
amusing yourself there or elsewhere as
well."

To Mentone ! " almost shouted Horace,
sunshine bursting out with a sudden beam
upon his handsome face, while he sprang
to his feet with so rapid a movement as
nearly to upset his father. " Dear, dear old
man. I see it all now ! "

Do you ? " replied his father dryly.
' I confess I don't. If I might venture to

express an opinion, I should say there is
madness in the air at Marsden Hall. 1
have been a shrewd lawyer for the past
thirty years and more, and I can see
through most things, but here the atmosphere
is too dense for my vision, I must
confess. I am sent for as if it were on a
matter of life and death ; and when I arrive
I am asked to send my son away for six
months, for no other reason, as far as I can
find out, except to humour some ridiculous
fancy. Then I am invited to dinner
as a sop, and the moment I enter the
room the Eector congratulates me upon
the dickens knows what, and now
you have caught the infection too, by
Jove ! "

Horace bursting out laughing, 
I don't believe you know, after all.
Didn't mother tell you ? "

She said you were delighted at being
asked here."

Of course I am. What else do you
know ? "

*' That you're as cracked as the rest ! "
replied Mr Lake irritably. " I never was
good at riddles ; I'm too old to enjoy them
by far."

Dad," said Horace, with a bright and
happy face, *'if I am at all insane, it is
with joy."

I only see the result ; I know nothing
of the cause," returned the lawyer ; " but
if you are sane enough to explain yourself,
I confess I shall be glad."

'* This is Lilian's birthday," began
Horace.

'* So her father informed me ; we're
here in honour of it," snarled Mr Lake.

Sir Richard, you know, has been ill,"
continued his son, " and Adela has been
nursing him. Under her gentle influence
his heart has softened strangely of late."

'* It was soft enough twenty-five years

ago, before sorrow soured him," said the
lawyer reflectively. " If you wanted a
kind action done. Sir Richard Freemantle
was the man to apply to."

I can believe it now," replied Horace
earnestly. " A week ago I could not
have done so, but yesterday he sent forme,
and questioned me, in his would-be
rough manner, as to my love for his
daughter, who, he told me, would not inherit
his property if she married me. I
assured him that I wanted nothing with
her ; that I would rather work for my owen
wife than let her be beholden to any one
else for what she required ; and he seemed
pleased. He then desired me to call at
half-past eight this morning, and when
Lilian came down he gave me to her, in
his own peculiar way, as though the thing
were a joke, rather than a serious sacrifice
to his pride and prejudice. Then, as it
was my dear girl's birthday, he kept me

to spend it with her, and at lunch he told
us that he is going to Mentone for the
winter months."

He is going to Mentone himself ! " interrupted
Mr Lake.

Just so, father ; and if he has fixed
this day week for me to start, he means
me to accompany them."

*' And he actually lias consented to your
engagement ? Well, the world must becoming
to an end ! "

"It is just beginning for me, dad. I
have often thought myself happy before,
but to-day I have really begun to live ;
and now that you do understand, father,
let me hear that you are pleased."

*' For your sake, I am ; very much so,
my boy," replied his father kindly ; "although
for my own I would rather you
had chosen a wife from our own set.
Miss Lilian is a very nice girl, but she
will miss her grand st3de of life when

she comes to inhabit a lath-and-plaster
villa."

Lilian is the truest \x\ on earth."

"No doubt she loves you, but she is not
likely to be much of a daughter to people
with our quiet ways."

You don't know her," replied his son.
She will love my home and my parents,
all for my sake, father. Have no fear
about her whatever."

Then, my boy, you have won a
treasure."

I have," answered Horace gladly, and
father and son clasped hands as the gong
sounded for dinner, and both hastened
downstairs.

OH, CECIL, CECIL, HOW YOU HAVE MADE

ME SUFFER !

!"

]E are nine," said Sir Eichard,
letting his eyes glance around
upon his guests. " Rector,
you are my oldest and best friend ; I can
take a liberty with you. Will you give
me a strong arm, and that will enable me
to offer my weak one to Mrs Lake ? We
three old folks can hobble along together,
and the younger ones must follow us. Lord
Carruthers, will you take Miss Thorndyke ?
Mrs Thorndyke will not quarrel with mr

Lake. And you two, my dears, require
no pairing."

Lord Carruthers had heard nothing of
the engagement, and gave a glance of surprise
at Horace and Lilian under his eyelashes
; but the party were on the move,
and no explanation was given.

The dinner was a very recherche one,
for the baronet had arranged the menu
himself, to the astonishment of his housekeeper,
and every one seemed thoroughly
to enjoy it.

The guests were glad to be there, and
were not ashamed to show their pleasure.

Sir Eichard felt happier than he had
done for years, and exerted himself to Idea
good and agreeable host.

Lilian was bright as a summer skv,
with her lover by her side, and
Adela was purely happy in the joy of
others.

Lord Carruthers was well contented with

his position, and was devoting himself to
her amusement.

The conversation very naturally ran
upon the proposed visit to Mentone, with
which place Lord Carruthers was well conversant,
and able to give full information
as to the best hotels to be found there, etc.,
and Sir Richard grew greatly interested
in all he said.

"You had better come and be our
cicerone. Strange if we should all find
ourselves there before the winter is out!"
he laughed.

/ cannot leave my flock," replied Mr
Thorn dyke, shaking his head.

Nor I my clients," remarked the
lawyer.

"No! but you will both be represented
by your children. Carruthers has neither
fold nor clients, and nothing on earth todo
but amuse himself. He ought to try
and be of use to his friends."

His lordship's eyes turned towards Adela,
but hers were fixed upon a slice of delicious
ice pudding ; and no wonder, for it looked
uncommonly good.

Had they been raised, however, he would
have seen that there was a touch of annoyance
in their expression, which did not
bespeak any pleasure at the proposition ;
nor could Sir Eichard see them, and he
was honestly endeavouring to put things
right for her.

He had heard a whisper of his lordship's
rejection in days gone by, and his
belief was that having rejected him she
thought him now beyond recall, and was
fretting at the fact.

He had, therefore, been watching his
visitor for some time past, and had
come to the conclusion that Lord Carruthers
still loved Adela, and was ready
to come forward again upon the faintest
encouragement on her part ; and he

determined to try and throw them together.


*' I shall be travelling in France and
Italy," replied his lordship, with as much
carelessness as he could assume ; " and
very possibly I may look you up at
Mentone, since you promise me a welcome."


We shall all be very pleased to have
your company," returned the Baronet decidedly.


But Adela never raised her eyes.

The Eector felt vexed with her, but
knew that any word of his would only
draw attention to his daughter's silence ;
so he wisely held his peace, merely
expressing his pleasure that Adela would
have so many English friends about
her to keep home green in her memory.


The dessert had been handed round by
the noiseless, well-mannered servants, who,

when their duties were done, as quietly
withdrew.

The Baronet looked over his shoulder to
see that the coast was clear, then turned
towards his daughter.

Speeches," he said, " have long been
laid on the shelf with many other pleasant
old-world customs ; but to-night, my
friends, I must claim the privilege of saying
a few words in honour of my daughter's
birthday, and also engrafted on to that,
her betrothal day. Lilian, my love to-you,
and may you be happy with the
man of your choice. I like to have the
last word, my dear, so don't let that
young thief who has stolen you from me
say a number of pretty things he does
not mean. One man's gain generally consists
in another man's loss."

He let his eyes rest upon her kindly,.
and raising a bumper to his lips, emptied
it in her honour.

A buzz of congratulation followed the
Baronet's announcement, by which it was
most plainly evident to all, that his opposition
was totally withdrawn, and that
henceforth Horace was to be received asa
future member of the family at Marsden
Hall.

Mr Lake no longer thought his client
fit for Bedlam ; the fog had cleared
away, and he felt very proud as he sat
there at Sir Eichard's well-appointed table,
in the reflected light of his son's new
honours.

'' I am sorry you will not allow me to
thank you. Sir Eichard," said Horace, with
feeling; "but all the dictionary strung together
could never express the gratitude
I feel, believe me ! "

"Yes! yes! You have got your own
way, lad. It is wonderful how amiable
people are when they have all they want!
I know I am myself."

Does that happy stage of existence
ever arrive really ? " asked Lord Carruthers,
with a smile.

It did with me," replied the Baronet,
in a low voice, with a far-off look ;
"but it was too bright to last. We
should need no heaven if it were todo
so."

And they all knew that the perfect
happiness he referred to, had been found
in the wife of his love ; and his words
threw a solemn silence upon them.

Father," said Horace, as he drew
Mr Lake aside into a quiet corner of
the spacious drawing - room, " T had
not time to ask you what you meant
about its costing Sir Eichard five
hundred pounds for me to go to Mentone
! "

Well, my boy, he has promised to
pay your salary while you are there

and that of some one else to do your
work 'pro tern., and he will of course
consider you his guest during your stay."

I could not accept it," returned Horace
firmly.

What ! don't you want to go ? '*
asked Mr Lake in astonishment.

More than anything. But neither
you nor I could play such an unhandsome
part."

I don't quite see that."

Don't you ? then / do. I could
not make money out of Lilian's father ! "

I don't look at it in that light. It
is a business transaction.

Nonsense, father ! there is no business
about it ; had there been, it would
have been all right. So long as you
did not know of the existing relations
between us you were not to be blamed
for entertaining the idea ; but now the
thing is impossible."

' What do you propose, then ? "

Bob would undertake my work forme,
I'm certain."

Your brother is very good-natured ;
I daresay he would. You can ask him,
at any rate."

"Til get some one to stand in the gap ;
and as to my own salary  I'll do without
it.

You're rather Quixotic ! You'll offer
to pay Sir Richard for your board next."

Not I ! I should be sorry to insult
im.

I didn't know how far your pride
might carry you," returned Mr Lake
snappishly.

** Father ! you know I am right."

And the lawyer did know it, and
that lie was wrong, and for that very
reason he felt out of humour with his
son for making him feel the fact.

Sir Eichard had not once remained

VOL. II. G

in the drawing-room to listen to music
since the voice of the woman he idolised
had ceased to fill it with rich melody.
Now he walked to the fine old grand
piano, and opened it himself.

His daughter's voice and musical talent
had been well cultivated at his desire ;
but when she sang he had shut himself
away from the sound of her music
as far as he could ; and, knowing this,
Lilian had entirely given up singing
when he was in the house.

Horace," he said, " find Lilian's songs
for her," and turned away.

The girl gave a timid glance at him,
and he looked back with a reassuring
smile.

Let us hear what you can do, my
dear," he laughed. " None of your
newfangled runs, but just an old
simple song, such as I heard in my
youth."

And Lilian sung him the old refrain,
'' Home Sweet Home."

There was a ring in her voice which
reminded him of her mother's, and tears
rose to his eyes as he listened, but
Lilian's powers fell very far short of
those of the dead woman.

She was nervous, moreover, and did
not feel that she had done her best,
and was in haste to quit her position.


Dela, do sing us something ! " she
said eagerly.

'eyes, Adela, do!" added the Baronet.
I often hear you sing over your work
a soft little lullaby."

Must / give you an old song too ? "
she queried kindly.

By all means, yes ; my ears are not
educated to the new."

Some of the ballads of the present
day are really beautiful ; I must teach you

to like them, I think ; but I will humour
you to-night."

And she sat down, and gave that touching:
old son Of, '* She wore a Wreath of
Roses," and the salt tears fell one by one
unheeded down the old man's wrinkled
cheeks ; for the wife he loved, who was
growing to perfection in God's garden,
used to sing that very song to him ; and
once more she seemed to be there with
him in the old room, and all his guests
were for the time being forgotten. She
and he were alone, and their love was new.

He gave Adela no word of thanks, but
sat as one spell-bound, and she sympathising
in his mood, and understanding it,
crept away into the dimly-lighted conservatory,
as she thought unobserved ; and
leaning her aching head against the cold
glass of the door, she looked out with
blind eyes into the darkness beyond.

"It is like my life 1 " she murmured

passionately. " Black as Erebus ! Oh !
Cecil, Cecil ! how you have made me
suffer ! "

Dela ! what is the matter ? " asked
Lilian's soft voice near her.

"Nothing Lil, nothing."

Dela, darling, I heard what you said
just now."

Did you ? " returned the other wearily.
'well, it did not amount to much."

"That is true; it only told me what
I have long known, that you are unhappy,
and I feel such a wretch to be in the sunshine
while you are in the shadow."

Nonsense, Lil. I do not pretend to
be high-minded, and say I am content to
be in the shadow. I should love the
sunshine as well as any other girl ; but,
Lil, I do strive to grow in it, to do
what good I can in my generation. I
don't want it to wither me up, and render
me useless ; but it is very hard to do so."

Poor, poor old girl ! So it is Cecil,
after all. You once promised to tell me
all about it."

"Did I promise? Well, I couldn't, Lil,
then, and I can't now. I may get used
to it by-and-by, and be able to do so,
but not yet. Don't ask me questions,
there's a dear, only thank Heaven that
you have gained the heart of a man who
would as soon mistrust his own honour as
your faith and love."

Surely no one who knows you could
mistrust you, Scamp, darling ? "

There ! there ! I have said enough !
too much. Go away, Lil ; I want to be
alone."

"You would not be, if I obeyed you.
Lord Carruthers has been waiting for you
as faithful as a watch-dog. His eyes
have been fixed upon the door ever since
you passed in here."

** Oh ! let me have a little peace tonight,

there's a dear girl," said Adela
impatiently.

I wish you liked that man, Dela,"
whispered Lilian. "He is good and
true."

** I can well believe it ; but, oh ! Lilian,
to love once with me means to love to the
end, and I shall love Cecil while life lasts."

'rit may come right, darling," said
Lilian, very softly. " Who ever could
have dreamed that Horace and I should
now be so happy \ "

Lil, my trouble makes me seem selfish,
but I am more than glad and thankful
for your joy."

If ijoii are selfish, Dela, darling, may
all the world become so," ended Lilian
with warmth, as she clasped her friend's
hand lovingly in her own.

The carriage was summoned, and the
party broke up.

After warmly thanking Sir Richard
for all his kindness to their son, and his
hospitality to themselves, Mr Lake and
his good-tempered wife withdrew to get
into their outdoor-clothing, warm wraps
having been necessitated by the fact that
they had been driven to the Hall in an
open trap. Mr and Mrs Thorndyke, who
had come in the close carriage, lagged
behind, to tell the Baronet how rejoiced
they were at the issue events had come
to.

'' It is so much better sanctioned," remarked
the Rector wisely. " Lilian was
too staunch ever to have given her lover
up. It was easy enough to tell her
that it was her duty to be obedient ;
but who in their heart could blame the
girl for her truth ? "

They say everything comes to the
man who waits ! " returned Sir Richard ;
and so the young people have found

it ; and no one is much more surprised
than I am myself," he laughed.

I wish I could see Adela as happy
as Lilian ! " said Mrs Thorndyke wistfully,
as she watched Lord Carruthers
saying a few parting words to the
girl.

I am sure she could be if she chose ! "
replied Sir Eichard meaningly, as his
eyes followed hers.

"I quite agree with you!" said the
Rector : " but orirls are full of strange
fancies ! When we wish things they are
dead against them, but if they once find
out we consider a man a detrimental,
it is all up with the affair. No one else
will do ! "

There is no incentive like opposition,"
laughed the Baronet. " If I had another
daughter, I should insist upon her marrying
the man to whom I most strongly
objected. AYith the light of experience

thrown upon the subject, I should have
no fears as to the result."

Horace and Lilian here came out from
behind the heavy folds of the window
curtains.

I heard your treason, father ! " she
said, with a shy smile.

'' Who was to know you were in there,
star-gazing ? " replied Sir Richard, somewhat
taken aback. " You should have
coughed to attract our attention ! Listeners
seldom hear any good of themselves
! "

Well, we did not much mind what
we heard ; did we, Horace ? "

Come, lad, we can make room for you
in the carriage ! It will save you the
run home ! " said the Eector kindly.

I fear my legs are not telescopic ! '*
returned Horace. ''No, thanks, I shall
enjoy the walk ! Lilian and I have ascertained
that it is a lovely night ; and I

want a word with Sir Eichard before I
start ! "

As you will. Where is Adela ? "

She stepped forward readily.

Good - night, my dear ! You will
come home for a few days before your
departure  to get your things together ? "

I will come to enjoy a peep at you
and mother ! " she corrected.

Well, it sounds prettier put like
that ? " and he stooped and kissed her.

Suppose we look for you tomorrow,
then ? " suggested Mrs Thorn dyke.

"With Sir Eichard's permission," replied
the girl, turning towards him,

' Say the next day, my dear ! I shall
be tired tomorrow, and dull too ! Excitement
brings reaction ! Stay with me
tomorrow, child ! " he said softly.

Very well ! The following morning,
then, expect me, mother dear ! " and she
raised her face for her mother's kiss.

Good-byes were exchanged, and the
carriage went swiftly away down the
drive, Lord Carruthers' pulling up at the
Hall door in its stead.

Then we shall meet again at Mentone
? " said his lordship, as he took
Adela's white hand within his own, and
looked down into her eyes. " Miss Thorn-dyke,
will you give me a welcome when
I arrive ? "

We shall all do that ! " she answered,
in a matter-of-fact way ; '* and no doubt
Sir Eichard will be pleased to see one
of his own countrymen again ! " and
she drew away her hand quietly, but
firmly.

You will find plenty of English
families in Mentone ! "

Yes ; but he has lived so quiet a
life ; he is not likely to know theme"'

'that is true."

"Is it pleasant there ? "

Very ! Won't you enjoy sitting with
open windows, even in winter time ? "

Immensely ! "

And you weill revel in the spring-flowers
? They are simply exquisite."

I am sure I shall. They are the
fairest of all which the year produces.
and that is saying something."

** Have you ever seen the conservatories
at my home, Miss Thorndyke ?
You have never honoured Axminster
Towers since I have been its owner, but
you may have been there before then ? "

We have not much time for running
about' replied Adela indifferently. " I
don't think I ever was there, even in
childhood."

I should be so glad if the Eector
and Mrs Thorndyke would bring you
over to lunch one day. I should like
you to see the hothouses, since you
care for flowers."

I am very fond of them, indeed,
but you see my time at home will be
brief. You must excuse my seeming
ungracious, but we could not manage it."

He heaved a sigh of disappointment.

'' I must hope for better luck upon
your return," he said regretfully. " And
now", good-bye. When next we meet it
will not be upon English soil. Heaven
bless you."

Then he turned from her, mingled
with the rest, and went his way.

Good-bye.

;AIT for me, darling, to say
good-night," whispered Horace
to his fiancee. '' I want
a word with your father before I leave."

I will be in the library," she answered
promptly ; and passing over to
Adela, who was standing thoughtfully
apart, she linked her hand through her
arm, and led her from the room.

Hallo ! " said Sir Eichard, watching
the movement. " What's up now ? They
have left us alone on purpose."

That is quite true, sir. I asked
Lilian to let me have a word with you."

I thought everything was settled,"
answered the Baronet, somewhat impatiently.
'' Are you not satisfied with the
arrangements ? "

'' Sir Eichard," said Horace gravely,
do you really wish me to go to Mentone
with you ? "

*' Lilian does, and that is much the
same thing," he answered. " Don't you
care about the trip ? "

More than I can tell you."

Then the matter is settled. What
is there to talk about ? We shall start
on the morning of this day week."

Sir Eichard, you have been more
than kind,  most thoughtful and generous
in your offers to my father concerning
me ; but when he accepted them, conditionally
upon my liking the scheme,
he was not aware of the relations existing

between us. He considered it a
business transaction, for which you were
ready and willing to pay handsomely.
As it is, although I gladly accept your
kind invitation to accompany you to Mentone,
and stay with you there, you must
allow me to decline, with many thanks, remuneration
for services T do not perform ;
and my young brother will, I feel sure, do
my work in the office during my absence."

*' Does your father agree to this ? "
asked Sir Richard.

Of course he does, sir."

Did he suggest this line of conduct ? "
he inquired, with a keen look.

Not exactly."

"Did/owP"

I told my father my opinions."

And did he agree with them ? "

They came fresh to him ; he had not
considered the subject, but he sees that
I am right."

VOL. II. fl

The Baronet remained in thought.

"You're a proud lad," he said at
length, with a smile breaking out over
his handsome face. " Are you quite
decided in this course ? "

Quite ! "

'well, well, I like you none the less
for your independence. I suppose you
will not refuse to accept bread and cheese
in my house ? "

Certainly not, sir. I am more than
grateful for the kind thought which will
enable me to spend the next few months
iDy my dear girl's side, and I thank you
very much. I have had a very happy
day, the happiest I have ever known,
and now I must not keep you up."

"No, lad. Send Adela to me, and
make your adieux to your lady love,"
and he shook Horace warmly by the
hand.

"Dela," said the latter, as he entered

the library, " we have bijou to thank for
it all. Is there nothing we can do to
prove our appreciation of your kindness ?
No brightness we can bring into your
life ? "

Nothing, my friend," she answered,
with a smile, " think of Lilian, not of
me. Don't you know, Horace, I'm always
bright ? "

Scamp, Scamp, don't tell arras
! " said Lilian, winding her arms
about her.

Did not Sir Richard ask for me ? "
she questioned suddenly.

Yes, he did," confessed Horace.

*' Then why did you not tell me so ? "
she cried impatiently, and walked quickly
towards the door ; but before she reached
it she turned back. " I'm a regular
Goth," she said, with regret in her tone,
but I am more pleased than I can explain,
at all that has happened to-day.

Dear old frieDcIs both, I congratulate you
from my heart."

Then she kissed Lilian, held Horace's
hand, and passed quietly out of the
room.

Is it Carruthers ? " asked Horace, after
a pause. '' Dela cares for some one, I'm
sure."

"No, it is not his lordship," replied
Lilian sadly. " I wish she could like
him, he would make her a loving husband,,
and he worships her."

I have thought so for a honos time.
Well, who is it, Lilian ? "

Why you, of course, boy. Does not
your vanity tell you so ? "

Can't say it does. Had Scamp made
love to me, little woman, who knows but
she might have cut you out ! " he
laughed.

** And saved me from a life of misery,.
eh ? Well, dear, these things are written,

I suppose, and you and I were meant to
torment each other, as you couldn't get
Scamp."

Do you think I ever tried, darling ? "
he asked, looking at her with a lover's
eves.

I am quite sure of one thing," she
returned rog;uishly.

And that is ? "

"That Dela never did, or you, or any
other man, would have been at her feet,"
she continued, with a smile.

*then why is she sad at heart, for
that is what I feel she is ? "

"Horace, our dear old Scamp doesn't
tell her secrets, even to me, so it is of
no use for you to question me about
them."

"All right, pet, I understand; I'm not
to know," he laughed.

No, nor I either, for the matter of
that, and it does not seem loyal to talk

of, and speculate upon, what she doesn't
wish to tell, does it ? "

Perhaps you're right, dear ; and now,
sweetheart, I must go. Are you quite
contented with your choice, little
woman ? ''

Quite," she answered, letting both
hands creep into his, while her soft dark
eyes met his own, full of confidence and
deep affection.

I would not exchange you for the
most eligible 'parti in the whole world."

Then he stooped and kissed her with
a lover's fervour.

I'm the happiest man on earth,
darling," he whispered " the very happiest,
my little love ! "

And /'m not altogether miserable, old
boy," she answered mischievously, as she
nestled in his arms in perfect confidence.

That is good hearing," he laughed ;
happiness is making you saucy, Lilian ! "

Papa wants me to be saucy, you
know."

Does he ? Did he tell you so ? "

'* He wishes me to be like Dela, and
she is saucy, goodness knows ! "

She is Scamp," replied her lover,
and you are my own dear love. Scamp
is the dearest girl in all the world, and
you are dearer still ; but neither of you
must be like the other, or both would
be spoilt."

I think I understand, Horace," said
Lilian softly. " I must be myself to
you because you have learnt to love meas
I am. Papa is going to care for meas
he wants me to be, and the nearer I
can come up to Dela the more he will
like me, so I must be very bright and
cheery with him."

Right you are, little one ; and now,
good-night. Heaven bless you, dear !
Only two years more, Lilian, and then  "

He clasped her to him in an almost
boyish ecstasy.

If you want me, then, don't choke
me now," she gasped. " I call this ill-usage."


You will have plenty of it, pet," he
laughed. " You have given yourself tome,
you know  have you not ? "

Horace, you must go," she said suddenly.


Little traitor ! you are laying up
heavy punishment, to be paid in the
future with interest."

I'm not greatly afraid," she answered,
laying her head against his shoulder,
and turning her ripe lips up for his
farewell kiss. "Is it not delightful
that you are to go abroad with me,
love ? "

'rit is indeed, Lilian, dear ; your old
father is a brick. We shall grow awfully
fond of him, I am sure."

"I wish he had always been like this,"
said she, thoughtfully.

I don't, or you would never have disobeyed
him, and stuck to me."

"In that case, I don't either," she confessed,
in a soft voice, "for you are the
one being in the world I could not do
without. Much as I love them both, I
would live without papa and Dela ; but,
Horace, I could not without you!''' and
she clasped her arms about his neck, and
clung to him.

'lovey, I am so glad, so very, very
glad ! " he whispered back, and held hera
willing captive in his strong embrace.

"Adela," said Sir Richard, as she entered
the room, "have I done all as you
wished ? "

"You have been most kind and noble,
you dear old man," she answered, coming
to his side, and passing her hand

gently over his silver hair. " You have
fought a brave battle, and come out a
generous victor ! "

"If I have done what is right, Adela,
I have to thank you, and you only. I
confess I have not gone through to-day
without pain."

And yet I have never seen you look
happier."

There is pleasure even in the sacrifice
of self, child, when one knows that the
holocaust is appreciated," he returned
with a smile.

Unselfish pleasure is the purest of
all," said Adela. ** And now let me
thank you for all you have done to
please me, and to make Lilian happy,"
and she stooped and kissed him.

I am more than repaid, my dear," he
returned, and pressed his lips to her
white hand, like any young gallant.

"And now," she continued, "you must

be very tired. Let me give you an arm
upstairs, you will be glad of a long rest.
Don't let any one call you tomorrow ;
have your sleep out, and ring the bell
when you awake."

I'll follow your advice, my dear. I
confess I'm fairly done up."

And he leant heavily upon the girl's
arm.

You must save up all your strength
for your journey," she added.

Adela, I am so glad you are coming
with us, my dear." he said earnestly.
"My life will be a dull thing when
you go out of it, my child. Do you
think the Rector would let me adopt
you?"

She looked round with an amused smile,
but his face was very grave.

"Would not papa laugh if you asked
him ? " she replied merrily.

You don't think he would consent ? "

You forget I am his one little ewe-lamb,"
she said gently.

No, no! I do not, but he has his wife;
he does not need you as I do," he answered,
with feeling:.

Do you care for ray company so very
much ? " she said kindly. " Well, I shall
be by your side to tease you for a long,
long time. You will be quite weary of
me before the winter is out."

'perhaps it would be better for me if I
could be so," he replied sadly.

Adela smiled.

It would not be flattering to my self-esteem,"
she admitted. " No, Sir Richard,
don't let me stay till you grow tired of me."

No fear of that, my child," he replied
earnestly, looking at her beautiful changing
face. "No one could do that."

And he left her at his chamber door with
no other word of farewell.

The intervening week between Lilian's
birthday and the day upon which the
party where to start for Men tone, was a
bustling one.

Adela had thoroughly enjoyed her little
bit of home-life, greatly as she was petted
and made much of at Marsden Hall. Her
father's kind words, and her mother's gentle
looks, were very sweet to her, after having
been in a measure without them for
some time ; and the hours they spent together
at their needlework, sitting at the
Eector's side by the fire, were happy and
peaceful ones.

I wonder," said Mr Thorndyke upon
one of these occasions, " I wonder I have
not heard from Egerton. I wish he had
chanced to come in upon us while
you were at home, Adela  don't
you?"

The girl's fingers trembled so that she
could not for the moment make a single

stitch ; but in a short time she raised a
quiet white face to her father's.

I daresay he will get on very well
without me, papa. I was scarcely more
than a child when we struck up a friendship,
and that was a very long while
ago."

Yes, but he has been here since that."
Then, after a thoughtful pause, Mr Thorn -
dyke added,  " I don't think you hit it
off with Egerton so well during his last
visit, my dear ? "

A roseleaf hue crept into her pale
cheeks, but she met her father's eyes
bravely.

Perhaps not," she replied, very quietly.
' Twenty years' disparity makes people look
at things from a different standpoint, of
course."

I thought so," laughed the Eector,
and neither you nor Cecil would give
up your opinions to save your lives."

"/ should not, decidedly, unless I saw
myself to be in the wrong."

Would you then f "

Certainly. Would not he f "

I hardly know ; Cecil is rather what
men call * pig-headed ' ; no doubt he considers
it firmness, but I don't ; yet he
has a generous nature, and if he could be
made to see that he had been wrong or
unjust, I think he would be more than
willing to make reparation."

But it would l>e hard to make him see
his error ? "

Very, I should fancy."

That is quite the estimate I have formed
of his character."

You have been studying it, then ? "

It is a way I have, dad," she answered,
with a smile. '' I cannot go through the
world with my eyes shut. I must analyse
my friends' peculiarities when I am in
their company ; and, do you know, I

often find that they are so different from
what we fancy them to be."

Sir Richard, for instance."

Yes, indeed. Who ever could have
believed him to be what he is ; shut away
as he has been behind that screen of reserve,
which he had placed around him."

I have always known him for a goodman,
although of late, like all the world,
I thought sorrow had hardened and soured
him."

He is not hard, dad, nor sour either,
but he has suffered very much."

Then after a pause, Adela looked up with
one of her own smiles.

Do either of you want to get rid of
me ? " she asked.

To get rid of you, child ! Heaven
forbid ! " returned her mother, with a look
of surprise.

Don't be alarmed, mother mine ; I'm
not going to be married, or any thing

dreadful," she laughed ; " but Sir Richard
would like to adopt me, if you are tired of
me at home."

** Greedy old rascal ! " exclaimed the
Rector, joining in her mirth ; "he has had
you for weeks, and is going to have you
for months, and now he wants to keep
you altogether ! No, no, my little Dela,
your poor dad must not be quite forgotten."

Adela laid her work down, and knelt
in her old childish way beside him.

"Do you avant to go, my dear?" he
asked, after a pause.

No, father," she answered readily. " I
am very fond of Sir Richard and Lilian,
but fonder still of you and mother."

I need not have inquired," he asserted,
with a look of contentment. " Need I, my
dear ? "

I don't think so, dad," she replied,
and laid her head upon his shoulder, and
was very quiet and still.

VOL. II. I

Time does not tarry ; and Adela's trunks
had to be packed for her journey. As she
looked at them, and then at her parents, a
pang of regret shot through her warm heart.
She did not at all like to leave them,
now the hour for doing so was drawing
near. She was really going for the sake
of Sir Eichard, whose mind appeared set
upon the project? and she did not wish to
disappoint him, because he was still weak
and ill, and because he had done so much
to please her.

But now that she looked at her father,
the thought came to her that he was altering
very much, and a fear took possession
of her.

Words came to her lips. She longed to
ask him if he were ill, but she wisely kept
silence until he left the room, when she
inquired anxiously about his health.

I do not think he is really ill, darling,"
answered her mother kindly ; " and you

must not spoil your holiday by fretting
about him ; but we must not hide from
ourselves the fact that your dear father
is not strong. I made him see the doctor
yesterday, and he says there is no cause
for alarm if he will only take moderate
care of himself."

But when did he ever do that, mamma ?
Papa's energy is beyond his power."

Quite true, dear girl. He says himself
he means to ivear out, and not to rust
out!'

Yes, but for our sakes he must not
wear out before his time," replied Adela,
with a sad smile. " Shall I beo- him not

o

to work so hard, before I go ? "

Do, dear, if you like. I will leave you
alone with him when he comes in."

He did so shortly after, and the girl
placed her arms fondly about his neck.

Father, dear," she said, " I have a parting
favour to ask."

Have you, my child ? If it be in my
power, it is granted before you name it."

*' It is quite within your power, dad. I
want you to take more care of yourself, 
not to go out all weathers, and to work
less hard altogether."

"You have asked what is difficult, Dela.
I cannot refuse to bury a man because it
is raining, nor to marry a couple when
I am tired ; but I will remember your affectionate
solicitude, and spare myself when
it is possible ; and with that my little girl
must be satisfied. Come back with roses
upon your cheeks instead of lilies, my darling,
and I shall be repaid for having deprived
myself of your company."

And let me see you look hale and
strong when I return, dear dad, and
then, please Heaven, we shall have a
bright spring and a happy summer
together."

He kissed her, spoke to her of her

journey, and then she went upstairs to
dress. Every little detail of her pretty
chamber seemed dear to her now she
was about to leave it. Things which
she had scarcely before noticed, suddenly
obtruded themselves upon her attention.
Her fathers books, her mother's work,
all speaking to her of a happy home-life.


A wave of regret flooded her mind.
How little she had thought of that home-life
lately !

Her heart had been so filled with painful
lonorinors, and useless thoughts of the
past, that the happiness which really
was her own, had been dwarfed out of
its truly beautiful proportions.

She had not realised it while she had
her home, but now that she was leaving
it, even for a time, the truth became
apparent. Her eyes were opened.

She groped her way downstairs, almost

blinded with tears ; was clasped in her
father's arms, and held to her mother's
breast. She heard their loving voices,
wishing her " Godspeed " in a far - off
dreamy way, and was soon in the Hall
carriage, going towards Marsden as
quickly as the horses could carry her.

'rit is hard to part with her," said
the Eector, as it passed out of sight,
but I could not refuse Sir Richard's
request. We must never forget that
we are indebted to him for this living,
which enabled us to marry. Dearly as
I loved you, Mary, 1 could never have
asked you to be a curate's wife on a
hundred and fifty pounds a year."

I would have accepted you, Edward,
if you had only had the fifty without the
hundred," she returned, with a loving
smile.

''I believe it," he said earnestly.
My dear, you have been a good and

faithful wife to me, and the knowledge
that such is the case, and that you have
cheered me along life's road for many
years, and often through rugged paths,
will give you contentment when the
snows of time have fallen upon your
head, and you may, perchance, no
longer have me by your side," and he
drew his wife's hand through his arm
and led her indoors.

SEEN THROUGH A LEAFY SCREEN.

ENTONE proved all which
Adela and her friends could
desire.

The damp and fog-born coughs soon
ceased, bronchitis was laid aside, roses
bloomed upon the girl's cheeks, and the
hue of health was seen upon those of
Sir Eichard ; while Horace, between happiness,
and change, and rest, looked
more "fit" than he had ever done
before.

Sir Eichard was beginning to like his
society, and to seek it, and although he

was not willing to acknowledge it, even
to himself, he no longer felt any regret
at his daughter's choice.

Almost every day the old Baronet
might be seen leaning upon the young
man's arm, with a bright and interested
face ; listening to his news, and his
amusing conversation.

Some materials strike sparks out of
the dullest metals.

It was so with Horace.

He had always something to say,
and whatever the theme, he managed it
so as to make it worth talking about ;
and Adela and Lilian looked on, well
content.

Among the English people at Mentone
that season were Lord Limestone and
his young wife and little son ; and
Cecil Egerton, at the earnest request of
the former, went thither to confer with
him about the boy's future.

Lord Limestone was sinking slowly.
He had no especial disease to which
medical science could be of avail. It
was with him a general decadence, a
failing of nature.

He was considerably above the age of
man, and knew that he could expect
nothing else ; and he was prepared for the
end. Nay, he would have welcomed it,
weary with the journey of life, but for the
sake of the two he must leave unshielded
in the world. Still he trusted to his
nephew to stand by them, and aid them
when he should have paid nature's last
debt.

He felt that his marriage had been very
hard upon Cecil, and he now meant to
leave him such a fortune as would render
him independent of the service, whenever
he desired to retire from it, after his many
years of soldiering. It seemed as though
the old Earl could not die until he had

commended his wife and child to his
care.

Lord Limestone's had been a somewhat
romantic marriage.

He had for twenty years had a private
secretary, who had lived in his house, and
attended to all his affairs ; one Captain
D'Arcy, who passed among them as a
single man, and was believed to be such
by the Earl himself, until the date of the
Captain's sudden illness and unexpected
death.

Then he sent for his patron, and, in
great distress of mind, told him a sad
history.

Captain D' Army had married in his
youth a lady of good family and expectations,
but the marriage had been a
clandestine one.

Had it proved happy, the young man
would have soon acknowledged it to the
world, but the tempers of the two were

unsuited, and they speedily agreed
mutually each to go their own way, and
leave the other untrammelled ; he plunging
into a vortex of dissipation, which soon
obliged him to leave his regiment, and she
to return to live in her father's house of
ease and luxury, which she bitterly regretted
having ever left.

Once only had he seen her after that,
when their little girl was born.

Then she had sent for him to see the
child, and he had gone.

He found her in a London lodmno, she
being supposed to be abroad with some
friends, who, knowing of her secret marriage,
were willing to keep her counsel.

He called again at a later date, and
found both mother and child gone, and
the former had left no address. He applied
to the post-office, but none had been
lodged there either, and he returned to his
club in a state of disgust, determining to

trouble himself no more about a woman
who cared so little for him.

Neither she nor the child could want,
he knew, for although she would not be
able to take her little one home to her
father's, without acknowledging her marriage,
her pin-money alone amounted to a
large sum, out of which she could well
afford to pay for the keep of her infant.

Shortly after, through an influential
friend, Captain D'Arcy obtained the position
in Lord Limestone's household,
which he retained until his death.

During his last hours the past troubled
him, and he charged Lord Limestone tolet
his wife know of his decease, receiving
from him a promise to see both her and
his daughter.

His lordship therefore went straight to
her father's mansion in Berkshire, there to
learn a sad story.

He had been ruined ten years before, by

a bank failure, and the family had split
up, each to earn their own living as best
they could.

He had considerable difficulty in finding
Mrs D'Arcy, but he had made a promise
to a man now dead, and he was determined
to fulfil it, if possible.

When he did find her, it was in a
state of almost poverty ; her daughter
was with her, her constant nurse and
companion.

Mrs D'Arcy had been no mean artist
as an amateur, and she had supported
herself and her child, at first with but
small difficulty.

But the long hours of labour, the loss
of brightness in her life, the poorer fare,
the confinement, soon told upon her
health.

She was too proud to apply to her
husband to help her, by whom she had
not stood in her younger days, nor had

she his address, save that of the club to
which she had directed in days gone by.

She did not know of his long residence
at Limestone, as the Earl's secretary.

She and Eosamond occupied two small
rooms in a pretty cottage at Richmond,
and the girl now went to London with
her mother's paintings, which grew fewer
and fewer as her strength gradually
diminished.

When Lord Limestone arrived at
Jasmine Cottage he was over fatigued,
and his sad revelation made, the invalid
had to bestir herself to wait upon him,
for Eosamond was out.

When the girl returned, she thought
the old man so ill that she went for a
doctor, who said he must be put to bed
at once, and carefully watched, for he
was threatened with apoplexy.

Here was a terrible position for the
Darcy. Eosamond carried their trouble

to their kind laDcllady, who offered to
give up her own airy bedroom to his
lordship, and to help the girl to wait
upon him ; and there Lord Limestone
had to remain for a week, his household
in a state of dismay at his unusual
absence.

No apoplexy intervened ; it was staved
off by the doctor's careful treatment, and
the old man went home.

But he could not forget Mrs D'Arcy
and her beautiful young daughter, and
before a month had elapsed, he wrote a
formal proposal for fair Rosamond's hand,
at the same time offering her mother a
home at Limestone. He had taken a
fancy to the bright-faced girl, and
thought this would be the best way to
help them.

His offer was at once gladly accepted.

Love was a sealed book to Rosamond
D'Arcy. She had had to toil early and

late, and it seemed to her that a life of
ease aud pleasure would be Paradise.

The price she had to pay for it
appeared nothing until her wedding-day ;
then her heart spoke  her womanhood
cried out. She shrank from the future
before her, and burning tears ran down
her pale cheeks, for she knew that she
was selling herself for this world's goods
knew that she had no love for the old
man whom she must henceforth call
husband.

But she drove back these natural feelings,
and became Lady Lynestoue, and
she and her mother settled down in
comfort in the beautiful home which was
to have been Cecil Egerton's.

There was to be no more toil now, no
more drudgery, no more poverty, but the
change had come too late for Mrs D'Arcy.
She lived to see Lord and Lady Lyne-stone's
little boy, and then faded away,

VOL. II. K

being united to the husband in death,
with whom she had elected not to remain
in life.

Rosamond had made the old man a
good and patient wife and nurse.

He was too infirm to take her out
into the world, as she had hoped and
dreamed, and well it was for her that
such was the case.

With her dazzling beauty and youth,
it was scarcely likely that her warm
young heart would not have claimed
some other kindred one for its own ; and
in a mind like hers the struggle between
love and duty would have been a fearful
ordeal for the young wife to pass
through.

In her quiet and beautiful home, with
her bonnie boy to interest and amuse her,
she was at peace, and content ; not pining
for pleasure which she had never known.
And there she remained for three more

years, when the doctors ordered his lordship
to a warmer climate.

They travelled from place to place, but
even the air of Italy and Switzerland cannot
remunerate, and the man of medicine
knew that the beginning of the end had
begun.

Lord Limestone wished to die in his
ancestral halls, but the homeward journey
was pronounced to be too much for him ;
but his desire grew even more urgent, and
it was decided that his removal should
be attempted as soon as his nephew arrived,
and he reached Mentone upon the same
day as Sir Richard Freeman tie and his
party ; whereas Lord Carruthers, who had
travelled more quickly, had been already
a, couple of days on the spot, and had been
devoting his time to making various arrangements
for the comfort and pleasure
of his friends from Marsden Hall.

Among other things, he determined to

procure some flowers to get placed in
Adela's and Lilian's rooms, which he felt he
could easily manage through the servants.

When at the florist's, he was strangely
struck by the beauty of a lady who was
choosing the fairest blossoms she could
obtain, which he heard her say were for
an invalid.

When she went away he inquired who
the beautiful girl was, and learnt that this
was Lord Limestone's young wife, so soon,
as all the world knew, to become a
widow ; and a great pity for her filled
his mind. He seemed obliged to think of
her, compelled to it by the force of her
great beauty.

And he found himself asking, again
and again, whether by any possibility this
fair young creature could love the infirm
old man with idiom she was mated ? and
his own heart answered *' No " emphatically.


Lord Carruthers' flowers were duly admired
by Adela and Lilian upon their
arrival, but one was as innocent as the
other as to whose kindness they were indebted
for them.

They found by the local paper, in the
visitors' list, that he had arrived before
them, and he left his card upon the first
evening, with his address, and made inquiries
for them after their journey ; but
delicacy prevented his breaking in upon
their privacy so soon.

When Cecil Egerton reached the beautiful
villa in which his uncle had taken up
his abode, he saw at once the desire to go
home had come upon him too late. He
had a long and earnest talk with the dying
man, who retained his faculties clear to
the end.

He heard from his own lips the whole
history of his marriage, and understood
the significance of the fact that the young

widow, countess though she was, had
scarcely a friend in the world ; and his
uncle pointed out to Cecil what a prize
she would be, with her beauty and wealth,
and how many adventurers would be about
her path, to whom she might fall an easy
prey, from her innocence and ignorance
of the ways of the world.

And Cecil promised to do the best he
could to shield and advise her ; also undertaking
the guardianship of the little
lordling, and Lord Limestone lay very
quiet with his feeble hand in the strong
one of his nephew.

'' Rosamond," he said, as she entered
the room, " it is too late ! "

What is too late, dear ? " she asked
sorrowfully, kneeling by his side, and looking
tenderly into his drawn face.

Too late to return home. But you
w ill bury me there, Cecil ? My bones
would not rest in a strange place."

*' I will respect your wishes in all ways,
my dear uncle," he replied kindly.

Rosamond," continued Lord Lyne-stone,
" when I am gone you must look
to Cecil for advice and guidance. If you
are in any difficulty, my child, appeal
to him. He will help you, for my
sake! "

I shall not forget," she answered
softly.

She has been a gentle wife, Cecil ; and
remember, I am not selfish enough to wish
her to spend her life alone. She is young,,
and will, I hope, some day marry suitably.
But, Rosamond, if you have any
doubt as to the fitness of your choice, consult
Cecil, and recollect that he was your
husband's only relation."

Tears filled the sweet blue eyes, and
words rose to her lips, springing from a
tender heart.

She was trying to tell her dying lord

that no other should take his place, but
he stopped her.

Hush ! my darling ! I will listen to
no such promises. I will not permit you
to make them. Who knows what the
future may hold for you ? Remember I
wish you to be happy ! Now, kiss me,
child, and let me sleep."

She obeyed him, and she and Cecil sat
there watching, listening to the laboured
breathing.

The doctor came, but did not disturb
him. He called Cecil on one side, and
told him he would probably pass away in
Ms sleep, and he was right.

Cecil went over to the young widow,
and taking her hand, tried to lead her
from the room.

Let me stay," she pleaded. '' I cannot
leave him ! "

My dear," he answered gently. " The
and was indeed peaceful. He has left you''

"No, no," she answered, in an awed
voice. " He cannot be dead ! "

She leant over him.

He breathed no more.

Then she stooped and kissed him,
weeping the while, and let Cecil take her
from the chamber.

That evening Cecil went out upon
various matters in connection with his
uncle's death, and to make arrangements
for the conveyance of his body to
England ; and as he stood within one of
the shops, he heard a voice which made
his heart stand still, and saw a tall slight
figure pass in company with another
girl.

Sir Richard and Horace were in front
of them, but he did not perceive them.
His whole attention was taken up by
Adela and Lilian, both of whom he recognised.


The former was looking bright and
happy, as well as the latter, for they
were expressing their satisfaction at the
ojood terms which had begun to exist
between Sir Eichard and Horace.

Had Adela turned round, she would
have seen her lover watching her. As
it was, the carriage was awaiting them
at the end of the next street, and as
soon as they reached the corner they got
in and drove off. So when Cecil made up
his mind to follow them, they were no
longer visible, nor could he understand
what had become of them.

Suddenly he looked up, and saw the
publishing shop, where the list of visitors
was printed ; but upon application for
one, he found it would not be out till the
following morning.

But the transfer of a heavy coin from
Cecil's pocket to that of the salesman,
brought the offer of the names and

addresses of any of the new arrivals he
might wish to know about, and he left
the office with the information that Miss
Thorndyke was staying at Greenhouse
with Sir Richard Freemantle and his
family ; and that night Adela's espiegle
face chased away the sweet, sad one of
Lady Limestone, and even that of the
dead Earl himself, and by morning Cecil
had made up his mind to call and see
Adela, see for himself whether he was
forgotten, or if the light of love would
ever again shine from her beautiful eyes
for him.

He had been wildly, madly jealous.
Reason was crushed out of his mind by
the stronger feeling.

Every mail he had expected to hear
that the woman he loved was betrothed
to another, and that other was Lord
Carruthers ; but no such news reached
him.

The last he had heard of her, was that
she had gone to Marsden Hall to help
Lilian to nurse her father, so he was not
greatly surprised to find her, even at
Mentone, in their company.

He still loved her with every pulse
of his exacting heart. She was just as
needful to his happiness as ever.

If he could once see her, he should
soon know whether she had shut him
out from her love.

One moment he told himself it was
no wonder if she had done so, for she
was a proud girl, and he had left her
with scarce a word.

The next he fiercely repeated that
there was no other course open to him,
as he had assured himself at Winsthorpe,
and over and over again since that sad
day when her self-will and his mistrust
had wrecked their joint happiness.

Sleep would not come to him. Restlessly

he paced his chamber, impatient
for the morning, that he might present
himself at Greenhouse ; and before noon,
he stood with his hand upon the latch
of the gate, with a wildly-beating heart.

The path up to the house by which
he entered the grounds was not the carriage
drive, bnt wound among beautiful
shrubs and ferns, being almost at times
hidden from view.

As he followed it, going towards the
house, Adela's voice came to bim, and
he stopped with a sudden longing to see
her unseen, and peered through the leafy
screen.

She was sitting under the verandah,
and advancing in her direction across
the lawn was a tall, fair young man.

Cecil Egerton's heart stood still. The
blood then surged with a mad rush
through his veins.

He clenched his powerful right hand,.

and dug his heel savagely into the gravel
path.

Dela," said the fair man, " which
will you have  red or white ? "

"Oh, white for me ! " she answered,
with a bright smile, looking up at him.

' Roses red and roses white,
As if pale with love's despair,
As if pale with love's despair,' "

he sang, as he handed it to her.

A great deal you know of love's
despair, you old rascal ! " she laughed.

I should have known it. Scamp, but
for you," he returned earnestly. "You
have been my good angel."

A wingless one, I fear," she retorted.
*' And now see  I have no pin."

*' But / have. You perceive that I'm
not an engaged man for nothing ; every
lover should be made to carry pins for
his lady's needs. Here you are, Dela, or
better still, let me put it on for you.

I'm getting quite an expert at that sort
of thing already."

Adela rose from her chair, and willingly
allowed Horace to pin on the roses
he had given her.

There was no reserve, no shyness between
these two ; there was not the
least consciousness, nor the faintest fear
of their misunderstanding each other.

But Major Egerton misunderstood them.
The old jealousy was raging in his breast.

That man again  curse him ! " he
muttered, through his clenched teeth.
*' Let her have him  he is a better
match than I shall ever be ! " he added
bitterly, " and she knows it," and he
turned away with uneven steps, going
out again by the gate he had entered
with so light a heart, heavy enough now
heavy as lead.

It was agony to him to see her accept
love gifts from another, to watch him

pin them upon her shoulder with a lover's
freedom, to hear him say she had saved
him from despair, to listen to his opinion
as to his own improvement as her lady's-maid,
since his engagement to her.

Every word entered his very soul, and
quivered there like a barbed and poisoned
arrow.

He had told himself from month to
month that it was all over between them,
but never with such dead certainty as now.

She was engaged to another. Horace's-
own words had been the funeral knell of
all his hopes.

He looked ten years older when he
once more entered the villa of his dead
uncle. Lady Limestone gazed at him in
wonder, questioned him as to whether he
was ill ; but Cecil was not the man to
appreciate the prettiest woman's sympathy,
if she were not the one woman
in the world for him.

So he forced himself to talk to her of
the funeral arrangements, earnestly persuading
her to remain at Mentone with
her boy, while he went to England with
his sad charge, and saw his uncle laid
to rest among his ancestors.

If you say it is right, Cecil, it must
be so," she answered, " for my dear lord
bade me trust you."

So Cecil asked a few people whom
he knew to be kind to the gentle young
widow until his return, and set out upon
his melancholy journey.

His path and Adela's had again met
and diverged, and she little guessed how
near she had been to having her lover at
her feet once more.

VOL. IL

I COULD NOT GIVE YOU LOVE FOR LOVE.

[S Cecil Egerton listlessly ran his
eye over the list of visitors
at Mentone, he was not in
the least surprised to see the name of
Lord Carruthers among them, and he
crushed the paper with an impatient
hand, and flung it aside.

At one moment he decided to go to
Winsthorpe, and upbraid his old friend
the Rector for not letting: him know the

truth about Adelaide

next he saw the absurdity of such
a step.

He had never, by word or look, taken
Mr Thorndyke into his confidence, and
how could he expect it in return from
him, or sympathy either ?

On the contrary, the Rector would be
rejoicing in the engagement, which, to
him meant lifelong loneliness ; for well
he knew that Adela's place in his heart
could never be taken by another.

Perhaps his old friend had even laid
pressure upon his child, to persuade her to
accept this good match, which he had
himself so ardently desired.

Not that Adela could have needed
much persuasion, he thought bitterly.
She had seemed perfectly at home with
the handsome young fellow who was
familiarly fastening roses upon her
dress.

Well ! there was little wonder. He was

in youth's pride and prime ; he was rich
and affluent ; while he, Cecil Egerton
was but a soldier of fortune, a major ina
marching regiment, with his best years
already passed.

The train whirled him honor through
France, his mind excited and sad.

Would Adela have married him if he
had now been Lord Limestone ?

He asked himself the question again
and again, one moment, loyal in his rejection
of the thought that riches or
station would have altered her conduct
one jot or tittle ; the next, recklessly believing
this, or any other evil of her.

Norland was reached at last.

It was not two years since he had
visited Limestone  his uncle's guest.

Now, he was accompanying all that
remained on earth of the Earl back to
the home he had loved,

He had lived honoured and respected

and had died at a good old age, respected
still, leaving a wife to mourn his loss  at
any rate, for a little space  and a hostage
to fortune in the shape of his merry, blue-eyed
boy  now Lord Limestone.

And Cecil, his acknowledged heir for
so many years, was not to reign in the
old place in his stead.

There was a large gathering to pay
the last tribute to the dead man.

No plumes or black draperies were to
be seen at the Earl's funeral. No black
hearse, or mourning coaches.

But there was a procession of well appointed
private carriages following the
catafalque, which reached from the mansion
to the chapel in the park, which although
in reality a private one, was
thrown open on Sundays for the people
of Limestone to worship in.

There the family vault was.

In the middle of the chancel stood a

rarely beautiful monument, upon which
the gold-hued glass windows threw a
seeming glory.

Four angels carved in white marble
were guarding it, one at either corner,
and the names of the Limestones, from
the days of the Saxon kings, were graven
upon it.

Facing the altar was a door by which
descent was made to the spacious vault
below, in which those of this ancient
family rested, who had died at home in
peace, while the bones of many had
bleached upon battlefields, and some had
known only a watery grave.

Among his ancestors they laid the departed
Earl, his coffin laden with white
blossoms, and turned each man to his
own home, save those who were invited
to be present at the reading of the
will.

There were the usual legacies to old

family retainers, and instructions as to
various favourite horses.

Cecil Egerton was to receive twenty
thousand pounds, as a mark of his uncle's
affection, and was appointed his boy's sole
guardian from the age of twelve to
eighteen, when he was to be permitted
to judge for himself of his future ; but
was recommended still to act under his
guardian's advice.

To Rosamond, his Countess, the Earl
left the sum of fifty thousand pounds
absolutely ; which she was to retain in
the event of her marrying again.

She was to live at Limestone, if she
desired it, should she remain a widow,
until her son married, upon which event
taking place, she was to inhabit the
Dower House upon the borderland of the
Park.

The rents, etc., were to be allowed to
accumulate as much as possible during

the young Earl's ininoiity, and the Countess
was lovingly entreated to confer with
Cecil Egerton, the Earl's loved and respected
nephew, upon all matters of importance.


All that he could leave to his wife
and to Cecil he had done. The rest was
entailed property.

When all had been arranged at Lyne-stone,
Major Egerton hesitated.

Should he fulfil his half-made promise
to go to Winsthorpe or no ? and he decided
in the negative.

He felt he could not bear to hear his
old friends there speak of the coming
wedding of the girl he loved so dearly.

So a few lines informed Mr Thorndyke
that press of business would prevent his
paying them his talked-of visit, as he
must return to Mentone to arrange matters
for his young widowed aunt ; but he
purposely omitted to mention his address

there, as he did not wish the Rector to
write to him.

The consequence was lie immediately
penned a line to Adela, and told her that
Cecil Egerton would be in Mentone almost
as soon as his letter could reach her.

Knowing: nothings of his last fatal mistake,
the girl het hope once more grow in
her heart.

If he should return, and ask her again
for an explanation of what he had been
unable to understand, or she then to tell
him, bow gladly would she reveal what
had at that time been her friend's secret.

Now, Cecil and all the world might
know who her fair and handsome gentleman
visitor had been, and why she had
met him as she had done.

The love-letter would be explained ; the
bogie of Lord Carruthers being; her lover
would be blown to the four winds, and
she 

Miffht she not be Cecil Ef2:ertoii's once
more ? Would he not ask her again to
be his wife ? Would he not open his
arms for her to nestle upon his breast ?
and should she not hear his heart beat
true to her \

She was alone in her chamber thinking,
and she held out her hands with a glad
cry, as though he were there to clasp
them.

She felt that he was coming, that he
was not a great way off ! If once they
met, all would be explained.

She never even asked herself whether
he loved her still. It never struck her
to doubt his loyalty. She believed him
to be as incapable of changing as herself.

A misunderstanding had parted them,
not want of love.

She had almost forgotten his lack of
trust, in her visions of reconciliation.
She was restless, and changeful in her

moods. Even Horace and Lilian could
not make her out. Gay as a skylark one
moment, the next wrapped in thoughtful
reflection, singing a snatch of a song,
playing some bars of a piece, and suddenly
stopping ; her book lying idle
upon her lap, or read by jerks. She
seemed always to be listening ; listening
for Cecil.

But days passed slowly by, and he
never came.

Sir Richard was once more himself
again, and he and Adela took daily walks
together, while Horace and Lilian wandered
in the country, side by side, avoiding
the haunts of men ; too happy in each
other's company to desire further companionship.
Sir Richard, on the contrary,
liked to look about, and see the people,
and the ships, so he and Adela went often
to the more frequented parts.

About a week after she had heard from

her father that Cecil was at Mentone, she
saw him, and he saw her.

He was in Lady Limestone's open carriage,
sitting by her side, with the little
lord upon his knee.

His eyes met hers coldly, and he merely
raised his hat as the carriage dashed past
with its fast-stepping bays.

Who is that, my dear % " queried the
Baronet, looking after the retreating
vehicle.

For the moment she was speechless,
all the blood seemed to have congealed
in her veins. She had seen her lover
again. Her soul had gone out to him,
and he had passed her with cold courtesy.

She heard her old friend's question ina
dazed way. Then she knew that he
had repeated it. The earth seemed to
have retreated beneath her feet.

She felt faint and ill, but she aroused
herself with an effort.

o

self, and she answered, in a firm voice, 

Major Egerton ; you know he is an
old friend of papa's."

*' To be sure, though I have never seen
him before, but he recognised you, my
dear, and he will be certain to look you
up. When he comes, Adela, make him
understand that your father's friends are
mine, and that he will be welcome at my
house. He must come and dine with us."

' You are very kind," she answered
simply, for she knew not what to say.

Her vision had been blown away by
one glance from Cecil's cold eyes.

There was not even surprise in them.
She saw that he knew perfectly that she
was in the place, and he had laid down
his line of conduct towards her beforehand.


He knew that she was there, and he
had not sought her.

"And who was the lady, my dear?"
continued the Baronet. " She was a very
pretty woman, and young to be a
widow."

Yes, she was really beautiful," said
Adela freely. " I think she must be Lady
Limestone, his uncle's widow. You will
remember that when Lord Carruthers
dined with us a day or two ago he was
speaking of her as one of the sweetest-looking
women he had ever seen."

Ah ! I recollect now, and she deserved
his praise. Widows are fascinating
little creatures, and Carruthers had better
take care of his heart," and Sir Richard
looked searchingly in her face.

"It is early days to be finding her a
new husband," she said, somewhat reproachfully,
'' even though hers was believed
to be only a mariage de convenance
; but if she is as sweet as she looks,
when a right time has elapsed. Lord

Carruthers might do far worse than become
her second husband."

And would none of his fair friends
grieve at his desertion ? "

She shruorored her shoulders.

"Who can tell? One think; I do
know, / should not be one of them."

He remained in thought, then spoke
suddenly, 

A mariage de convenance was it ?
Yes, yes, I suppose so. There must be
some strong motive to induce summer
to waste its bright days upon winter. It
was not likely she loved him, was it,
Adela ? "

You have asked me a question I cannot
answer ; I never saw the late Earl."

But, generally speaking, such love
would not be likely, or possible ? "

*' Not likely, but certainly possible."

'' You think so, my dear ? " he said,
looking at her with interest.

It would not be like the love of two
young hearts, perhaps ; but I think a
girl might be very fond of an old manif
he were what he ought to be, ripened
in goodness with his years."

There are not many such, my child.
Ah ! here comes Carruthers."

Then he turned to his lordship.
We have just seen your widow," he
laughed, " and a lovely little woman she
is ; but there was a good-looking fellow
already in possession."

Indeed ! so soon ? Who, may I ask ? "
*' Major Egerton ; he's a friend of Miss
Thorndyke's."

Egerton ! Why, she's his aunt ! "
His aunt ! she does not look like it."
I should have said his uncle's widow.
His marriage must have been a great
disappointment to Major Egerton, for he
didn't marry till he was seventy-five or
six.

Ten years my senior ! " cried Sir
Richard, " and married to a pretty young
oirl. Well ! there is a chance for me
yet  eh, Carruthers ? "

I shouldn't like you for a rival if
you entered the lists with me," laughed
Lord Carruthers, and then he added
mischievously, " perhaps Lady Limestone
would like another matured man, Sir
Richard. Who knows ? "

Who indeed ! " chuckled the Baronet ;
"but, to tell the truth, I looked upon you
as her admirer, and was saying so to
Miss Thorndyke as you came along."

Lord Carruthers coloured.

Although he had been thinking a good
deal of the widow and her beauty, his
affections were still Adela's, and it was
far from pleasant for him to have such
a suggestion made to her ; and he longed
for an opportunity to convince her that
Lady Limestone was nothing to him.

VOL. II. M

You are very thoughtful, Sir Richard,"
he said, in a nettled voice, " but rather
precipitate, as I have not even yet
been introduced to the lady in question."


The Baronet laughed.

He knew exactly what his lordship
felt. He had in fact laid the trap for
him, for he had not yet quite put aside
his idea of making Adela happy.

Lord Carruthers accompanied them
home, and was invited by the Baronet
to remain to dinner, so he sauntered to
his hotel and dressed, and returned in
plenty of time for that meal.

It was a beautiful evening, and the
stars were shining overhead as bright as
diamonds in the sky ; and all but Sir
Eichard were tempted out into the
garden.

Go out, my dear," he said kindly to
Adela. " I have not seen you look so

pale since you left England. You are as
white as the privet flower."

"If I am as hardy I shall not hurt,"
answered Adela, with a sad smile.

My dear, is anything the matter ? "
he asked anxiously, looking at her heavy
eyes.

My head aches," she replied. *' It
is not much to talk about, is it ? "

The air will do it good, Adela ; stay
as long as you feel inclined. I shall
take a nap most likely."

So she joined the other three, and
they wandered about the grounds ; she
and Lord Carruthers in front. Suddenly
she stopped, for Horace and Lilian were
nowhere to be seen.

His lordship had no mind to miss
the opportunity which had been made
for him, either by design or accident,
and turned to her, the moonlight falling
upon his refined, well-cut features.

Adela," he said softly, " I was most
terribly vexed at what Sir Richard said
to me to-day regarding Lady Lyne-stone."


Yes, it is a mistake to make such
speeches," she replied readily, " especially
when they are made in reference to a
recent widow. She would naturally be
bitterly annoyed if she by chance heard
of them ; but of one thing you may
rest assured, it was said thoughtlessly,
and with no intention to give offence."

*' All you say is quite right, Miss
Thorndyke," he continued ; " but you
do not seem to understand the chief
cause of my annoyance. I shame to say
it was not delicacy for her ladyship's
feelings."

No ? " she said interrogatively.

No ; it was the fear you should
believe that I could think of, or wish,
any other woman for my wife except

yourself, Adela," he went on earnestly.
I have loved you now more than three
years. No other woman has been aught
to me during that time. Your image
has filled my heart to overflowing. I
have loved you, and I love you still,
with a deep and earnest affection, xldela !
Adela ! my dear girl, have you no kind
thought for me ? Do you continue indifferent
as to my happiness ? "

Lord Carruthers, I am not indifferent
to your happiness at all," she answered
kindly ; " and, indeed, nothing could
give me more pleasure than to hear that
you were thoroughly content with your
life."

Then, dear one, let me hope that
you will give a different answer to my
prayer from that I received at Wins-thorpe.
I cannot be happy without you."

You would not be so with me," she
answered sadly.

Should I not ? " he replied, in a low,
passionate voice, drawing her to him.
Adela, give me a trial ; see if my
deep devotion cannot satisfy you ? Oh !
my love, you do not dream what you
are to me."

"Perhaps not," she answered. *rand
yet I think I do understand."

You cannot, or you would not torture
me by your coldness ! " he cried.

"I am not cold," she said gently.
Indeed, I wish to be your friend ; so
much do I wish to be your friend that
I will not shrink from giving myself
cruel pain to prove it to you. Lord
Carruthers, you will promise that what I
say shall be sacred to you ? "

As sacred as my mother s honour,"
he replied solemnly.

I am satisfied," she said, half under
her breath. Then she turned and placed
her cold hand in his.

Would you wish a wife to lie in your
bosom with a heart wildly longing for
another man's love ? Would you wish
her to evade your kiss, because it is not
his ? To shrink from your tender words
because they do not fall from his lips ?
To know that every fibre of her nature
quivers at his touch, trembles at his
footfall ? To realise that whatever worship
you give her, she loves him more ? That
all your deep affection can give her no
joy, no happiness ; her happiness being
centred in another ? Would such a wife
make your comfort, my friend ? Would
you desire such a one for your life
companion ? "

'heaven forbid!" he replied earnestly.

Then never again think of me as
aught but a friend. I like you truly ; my
love is beyond your reach ! "

"Adela, can this be true?" he queried,
in a pained voice, " or are you trying to

cure me of my love ? Are you building
up this barrier to drive me away ?
Nothing but the knowledge that you
belong to another will silence me, rest
assured."

My heart is not mine to give," she
said sadly. " I might almost say ' I
wish it were,' for your constancy touches
me, and I believe you will be very good
to the girl you marry ; but I value your
peace too much to accept your offer,
knowing that I could not give you love
for love,  could not satisfy your large
heart. Dear Lord Carruthers, seek some
gentle woman who would make you a
loving, yielding wife and companion
through life. I could not so wrong
you as to take advantage of your devotion
! "

Adela," said his lordship, with feeling,
you have been very good to me ; I
know that it has cost you dearly to tell

me the truth, for I fear your choice has
not been a happy one ? "

**No, it has brought me much sorrow,"
she confessed, with trembling lips.

"Will you make me one promise,
dear ? " he asked.

Yes ; I can trust you."

If ever you overcome this fancy, and
feel you are free to love another, and
capable of wifely affection, you will let me
know."

"Do not think of it; it is not a fancy,
it is the love of years ! "

"Adela, it is impossible that you can
love in vain, if your lover is worthy of the
name of man."

He is worthy, believe me. I have no
need to be ashamed of him," she said
warmly, "he is brave and true!"

"Do not ask me to suppose the fault is
yours, Adela ; I cannot do it."

Believe that there was no fault at all,

that circumstances placed me in a false
light ! "

And he could not trust you ! My
dear, I would have stood by you against
all the evidence the combined world could
produce. Adela, I would to Heaven your
passion for this other were not so great,
that I might shelter you from sorrow and
care ; but, my dear, I could not bear it.
Every time I saw a cloud upon your white
brow, I should feel that you were longing
for him, and not for me. My soul
would be torn with anguish," he added
brokenly.

I know it," replied she tenderly ; 'rit
would be so with every true man. My
friend, you must live it doivn ! "

Yes ! I must try and live it down, for
the present I think 1 had better go away,
and see whether your dear face will haunt
me less elsewhere."

"You are quite right. Lord Carruthers,

and when it is done, come back. Let
the past, with its dead hopes, never bespoken
of between us, and let us be fast
friends."

"That is a compact," he answered
kindly. " And now, Adela, good-night; I
cannot go back among the others. They
must have guessed my secret ; no doubt
they will understand."

Good-night," she said softly, " and
believe that I am sorry to have given you
pain ! "

They clasped hands then warmly and
firmly, and the night breeze seemed to
take up her words, and to echo his sigh,
as he parted from her, and went out into
his life alone.

A LAST LOOK AT THE ROSY WEST.

jHE winter passed happily enough
for all the dramatis persons
in our little life-drama.
To Horace and Lilian it brought unalloyed
joy, to Sir Richard Freeman tie
peace and contentment ; while A.dela
strove to enjoy the good things left to
her, and to shut out from her mind that
ever painful theme, Cecil Egerton, and
her love for him.

It was not an easy task.

Nay, it was an impossible one, but she

hid her sufferings even from her dearest
friends, and they thought her happy.

It was only when she was alone that
her heart-weariness would at times overcome
her, and break down the proud
spirit which so bravely enabled her to
hide her sorrow from an unsympathetic
world, and sympathetic friends alike.

Lord Carruthers had been travelling
from place to place and visiting among
his kinsfolk and acquaintance, and everywhere
the man whom Adela had rejected
was a welcome guest and favourite.

To say he had ceased to care for her
would be erroneous, but he thought of
her now with no hope,  as a being
beyond his reach.

He no looser intermingled her life with
his, in imagination, and was one step upon
the road to a more healthy state of
mind.

Bob Lake was going into the Church,

being " the fool of the family," as Scamp
Thorndyke had told Cecil Egerton up in
the old walnut tree years before ; and he
was now very good-naturedly doing the
office work in his father s business, which
usually fell to Horace's share.

He had a hero worship for his elder
brother, and would have done even a more
unpleasant thing for his benefit.

Tom, the youngest of the family, was
now at Sandhurst, an embryo officer, and
in his cadet state was eagerly longing
for his commission, and greater independence.


Lady Limestone truly sorrowed for the
kind old man who had done so much for
her, but it was not a sorrow without
hope.

Friends had quickly rallied around her,
and now, no longer tied by her wifely
duties to the side of her invalid husband,
she mixed in a quiet way in the society of

her acquaintances, daily becoming more
admired and sought after.

Sir Eichard and his household, in the
shape of Adela and Lilian, had called
upon the gentle widow, and a warm affection
sprang up between the three ladies ;
but it was from Sir Eichard's lips that
Lady Limestone learnt that her late lord's
nephew and Adela's father had been close
friends  a fact which drew her still nearer
to the girl.

But, strange to say, Major Egerton was
never spoken of between them.

Perhaps with some subtle insight into
that mysterious thing, a woman's heart,
the young widow guessed that there was
a place in that of her new-made friend,
Adela, a holiest of holies, into which none
were invited to enter, and that the image
there enshrined was Cecil Egerton's.

True it is that after the few first chance
mentions of his name, she avoided it, or

spoke of him with averted eyes, lest she
should seem to watch the sad white face
of the listener.

She told Cecil, in one of her letters,
that she had made Adela's acquaintance,
and how much she liked her ; but her
communication was not commented upon,
and she Wrote of her friend no more.

She was not of an inquisitive or
interfering nature, and had no wish to
pry into the feelings of those who showed
no desire to make a confidante of her.

Cecil Egerton was eating his heart out
in silent misery.

He would have given much for the information
which he was too proud to seek,
or even to encourage.

He could scarcely repress the longing
to know all the particulars of Adela's
supposed engagement, and yet he shrank
from her very name.

He was for ever saying to himself that he

had put her outside his life, outside his
love ; but he left the door of his heart
open for her to creep back and nestle
there.

Mrs Thorndyke said little to her
daughter of her father's health, and his
own letters to her were cheery, and full
of anticipation of a bright meeting, and
Adela let her fears rest.

But the heart of the Eector's wife
became heavier day by day, with a
growing fear, and the family doctor was
graver than of yore, for his patient's
strength diminished instead of increasing.

He was advised to try change of air,
but he shook his head.

"Home," he said, 'was the place fora
sick man, and he would stay there,"
nor would he hear of help in his work,
his desire being to " die in harness."

It came with a shock to Adela, upon
her return, to find her father so much
VOL. II. N

weaker, and his pale cheeks so thin, but
she smiled still in his presence, and hein
hers, each keeping up the deception of
hope for the other's sake.

She did not remain at Marsden Hall
at all, but went straight home, blaming
herself for her long absence, which had
kept her from her duties of love.

Eobert Lake was ordained, and a little
plot was laid between the Eector's friends
to give him help in spite of himself, and
Mr Lake asked him as a personal favour
to take his son as his curate.
He had a regard for the lad, and did
not like to refuse, so the young man
lived still with his parents, and lightened
the Rector's work, doing the better from
the fact that he felt all he did would
save his senior, for whom he entertained
a sincere esteem.

So the summer, to which Adela had
looked forward, came, and was a bright

one, but damped by her secret sorrow ;
and the new fear, which at first was
only vague and shadowy, was now
taking shape and form.

But still Mr Thorndyke was cheerful
and active as his strength would allow.

He never spoke of his approaching end
except to his wife, and from her he had
never hidden the truth.

He had not guessed his daughter s love
for Cecil Egerton, but he saw that his
hopes as regarded Lord Carruthers were
at an end. He had thought that meeting
in Mentone, and being then thrown together,
it was more than probable that
Adela might learn to enjoy his society,
and from that might grow fond of him ;
but upon learning from Sir Eichard of his
abrupt disappearance from among them,
he could no longer shut the truth from
his mind.

There was little doubt that Adela had

dismissed him again ; and this opinion was
shared by Sir Richard Freeman tie, who
was more at sea than ever to account for
the trouble which he had at times surprised
upon her face, the sorrow in her
steadfast eyes.

When late autumn set in Mr Thorn-dyke
found himself obliged to give up
his clerical duties ; but Bob Lake now
knew all his ways, and daily conferred
with him in his study, following out all
his wishes.

And his friends looked hopefully forward
to the spring to see the Eector better ;
and carefully his wife and daughter nursed
him through the winter months.

Snow lay deep upon the ground, but
no cold reached him in his snug home.

The holly, and the mistletoe, and the
kind wishes of all around him, told him
that it was Christmastide, and it pleased
him to receive visitors for a little time,

only he soon grew tired of listening and
speaking.

Sir Richard seemed to have outgrown
his delicacy, and there was no need for
him to 2:0 abroad for his health or for
pleasure. He felt he could not do so,
with so much anxiety among his dearest
friends.

Many and many a talk these two had
together, for it was the Baronet's daily
custom to drive over to the Rectory, and
it was the greatest enjoyment of his life.

He missed Adela in his home more than
he would have cared to confess, and the
peep at her every twenty-four hours
seemed to bridge over the gap in his
existence occasioned by her absence.

Often and often he had it ail bout des
livres to ask the Rector if he would
approve of his adopting his daughter in
the future ; but Mr Thorndyke had never
spoken to him of his near end, and Sir

Richard was waiting for him to hroah
the subject, which he hoped he would one
day do, but that hour never came.

It had always been the Rector's custom
to read family prayers morning
and evening, but the former was now
delegated to his wife to do, for he was
not able to get up till the middle of
the day.

The evening devotion he still conducted
before he went early to bed.

The winter had passed, and the first
sudden warmth of the early spring days
had begun, and Mr Thorndyke had
found them unusually trying.

He had essayed to walk round his
beautiful garden one day in the sunshine,
but had been obliged to give up the
attempt, from the unusual sensation of
extreme weariness.

And he had rested placidly in his
arm-chair, looking out towards the

west, till the sun was sinking in bright
effulgence in the sky.

"My dear," he said to Aden, who
was sitting by his side, " I will read
prayers now, and go to bed."

She looked at him in surprise.

It is only six o'clock, father dear,"
she answered gently. " Did you forget
the time ? or will you have your dinner
in bed to-night ? "

'' No, my child, I did not forget,"
he replied, in a faint voice ; " but I am
so tired, so weary ; I want rest."

Do not wait for prayers, darling ! "
she urged ; " mother will read them.
Let me give you my arm, and come
at once."

No," he answered, his eyes fixed
upon the rosy west ; " I will conduct
them to-night."

Adela at once summoned her mother
and the servants ; and the Rector of

Winsthorpe read a few verses of the
Bible, and prayed ; and those who heard
that short, earnest prayer never forgot it.

It was uttered in a low, sweet voice,
and ended with a blessing. And Mr
Thorndyke remained upon his knees,
with bent head, the sun lighting up his
pale face with seeming glory.

He did not move when the servants
left the room, and Adela and her mother
were very still, for the father and husband,
as they thought, was still praying,
still kneeling there with closed eyes,
and a peaceful smile upon his lips.

But Winthrop's good pastor would
neither preach, nor praise, nor pray anymore
on earth !

His weary body had found its needed
rest. His spirit had fled to the Great
Unknown, where the mystery of mysteries
will be to each revealed.

THE NEW RECTOR OF WINSTHORPE.

[HERE was scarcely a dry eye
in Winsthorpe when the Rector,
who had so long and so
lovingly watched over them, was known
to be dead.

He was mixed up in all that concerned
both rich and poor.

He had buried their dead, comforted
the mourners ; he had given a strong
hand over death's borderland to the
feeble and dying ; he had sat with the
old, and read with them, and had ministered
to the sick.

He had married the young men to
the maidens, and baptised their children.
He had known the secrets of many,
and had faithfully kept them.

He had been true to his trust ; a
good shepherd, and the people of his
flock knew it.

Most of them begged to be allowed
to take one last look at the placid face,
and not being refused, went, and laid
their humble cottage flowers, bedewed
with honest tears, at his feet ; and the
rare exotics which came after, were not
more valued by the widow and orphan
than the offerings of the poorer brethren
who loved him.

There was no noise, no confusion,
when they laid him in God's garden.

His followers were all mourners, not sightseers,
and his mourners mourned him truly.

The funeral over, Sir Richard Free-mantle
drove to the Rectory.

"Mrs Thorndyke," he said kindly,
taking both her hands in his. " I have
come to fetch you and Adela. I have
longed to do so every sad day of this sad
week, but I felt that while he was here,
nothing would entice you away."

*' You were right," she answered, with
tear-dimmed eyes. " I could not have
gone, nor must you ask me just yet."

For Adela's sake, if not for your
own," he pleaded. " She is completely
overwrought, utterly overdone ! "

For her sake I would do anything,
but I do not think she would wish it.
Every place is so dear here, because he
loved them ; there is not a thing which
does not remind me of my darling."

That is just it, you will never be
better while you remain here."

You must give me a little time," she
said sadly. " I shall only have six
weeks in my dear old home, then I must

seek another. That is clerical law, I
believe ? "

** Well, will you promise to pay me a
long visit then, since I cannot persuade
sou now ? "

** Thank you, I shall be glad to do so.
You are very kind."

"I am much disappointed," he replied.
*' I hoped to have carried you off tonight.
Where is Adela ? "

She heard his voice, and came down
to him, pale and wan, a silent agony in
her azure eyes, but no word of complaint
rose to her lips, and Mrs Thorndyke
had slipped away.

''Adela," he said softly, "my dear girl,
my heart bleeds for you. I know what
you have lost, but you must now let me
be a father to you."

No one can ever fill his place," she returned,
in a low voice. " With me a place
once filled in my affection is filled for ever ! "

There was a look of keen disappointment
upon the old Baronet's face ; at the
same time his admiration and respect for
her increased.

"Then, my dear, I hope I niiiy claim
to be your friend ? " he answered simply.

She stretched out her hand to him.

One of my very best," she answered
warmly. "It is good of you to come tous
in our sorrow."

My dear, I had hoped you would
come to me. I desired to take you back
with me, away from these sad memories."

They are all we have," she said
brokenly.

Well, Adela, your mother would
rather visit us later. Will that suit
you ? "

I will do whatever she wishes," she
returned wearily. " It seems so utterly
sad for us to leave our dear old home ? "

Sir Eichard remained in deep thought

awhile, then there was a sudden brightening
of his keen eyes, which showed an
idea had struck him which had given
him pleasure.

May Lilian come to you tomorrow,
child ? She will be fairly vexed with
me for not taking you home with me ! "

*' Mamma was right, our place is here
for the present. Our time must needs
be short, and there is much to be done."

'' Will you mind leaving here very
much ? " he questioned.

*' More than I can say. It has always
been my home, and for mother the trial
will be worse. I think this last straw
will break her down. A clergyman's
widow has always this last trouble above
others, that however thoughtful her
husband may have been, he cannot prevent
her being turned from the home
which has been her Eden."

Well, well, child, do not meet troubles

half-way. Promise to come to me this
day month and I will see what can be
done with your dear father's successor.
He may be in no hurry' to take possession
of the Rectory, you know it is in
my gift."

I had forgotten it, although I have
heard both my parents speak most gratefully
of your great kindness to them."

So a month afterwards Adela Thorn -
dyke and her mother were visitors at Mars-den
Hall, and Lilian and Sir Richard could
not make enough of them.

Horace," said the Baronet one day,
come and dine with me this evening,
and bring your brother Bob with you.
I have not forgotten that he did your
work for you while wee were at Mentone.
He is a nice young fellow, and we must
change him from a deacon into a priest as
quickly as possible."

He will be very pleased to accept your
kind invitation, I am sure. He is fretting
at the thought that he will have to leave
here, poor old boy, but it is possible he
might be re-engaged if you would recommend
him to the new Eector."

I'll see, lad, I'll see ! '' said Sir
Eichard. " You can both stay and talk
to me when the ladies have retired this
evening."

They did so ; and the Baronet sat gazing
upon the ground.

Suddenly he looked up.

It seems like robbing the dead," he said,
with emotion, '* to put any one in dear
old Thorndyke's place ; but the living
must be given away. Winsthorpe cannot
be without a rector, so I mean to
present it to the person who I think my
poor friend would like best to see in his
shoes, of whom I have heard him speak in
warm terms."

I quite understand your feelings, sir,"
replied the Curate. " It will be pain tome
to see any other man in his pulpit
but I have grown fond of the people, and
I should grieve to leave them. I have
been hoping for your good word to the
new Eector, if you think he is likely to
require a helper."

*' I don't think he is in the least likely
to want one," replied the Baronet, with a
smile, and a mischievous twinkle in his
eyes. '* He will be a strong young fellow,
and able to do the work for himself"


The shadow of disappointment fell
across Robert Lake's face.

Then I am afraid there is but little
chance for me," he said.

But Sir Richard did not seem to notice
his remark.

He turned to Horace.

Let me see  how old are you now ? '
VOL. II.

I am twenty-five," he answered
readily.

And your brother ? "

Bob is three months over twenty-four ;
we came near together ; Tom is considerably
younger. By-the-bye, sir, he has got
his commission."

Has he ? Well, he's a smart lad ; he
will make a good-looking soldier."

"His heart was set upon it. I'm very
glad he has been able to follow his bent."

Yours was the same way, my boy, was
it not ? " asked the Baronet.

In years gone by, sir, but I am
most thankful now that I remained
here."

Why ? "

*' For Lilian's sake."

'what, you don't believe in truth in
absence ? "

Indeed I do, but we shall be much
happier as it is."

Yes ! you are right, Horace ; Lilian
must have a settled home."

Suddenly he turned to Robert.

Now, young man, what can I do for
you ? " he asked.

For me, sir ? Nothing, thank you," he
stammered. " Had there been any chance
of my being able to remain here, I would
have asked you to help me in the matter,
but as it is  "

"As it is, I owe you something for
being a good-natured fellow, and doing
your brother's work for nothing ; and I
want to get out of debt. Can't you think
of any favour to ask ? "

I can't indeed."

Humph ! You're slow to seize an opportunity.
Why don't you ask for the
living for yourself, eh ? " and Sir Eichard
looked at him keenly.

Robert Lake flushed.

You are laughing nt me, sir," he said

respectfully ; " and, besides, I understood
you had decided upon whom you mean to
bestow it. Moreover, I am too young to
solicit such favours, or to dream of such
patronage."

In fact you prefer being a curate ?
You're a perfect Tommy-too-good, eh,
Master Bob ? You're too young to seethe
advantages of having a living," laughed
the Baronet.

No, no. I'm not so young as that ! "
returned Bob, laughing too.

Oh ! not too young to accept a good
living if ever it comes in your way, eh ? '*

"It is not likely to come in my way,
sir ! "

I'm not so certain of that. Have you
got your eye on a sensible wife, my boy ?
In my humble opinion, a parson should bea
married man as well as a doctor."

The hot blood rushed into Bob Lake's
face.

Hallo ! I see you have. Now, out with
it. Who is the lady of your choice ? "

Eeally, sir  " he began.

Nonsense ! Let me hear if the lady
is suitable ; it's as much my business as
yours."

Excuse me, Sir Eichard, but I really
can't see that. If my heart has gone out
to any one during the past few months,
the fact is known only to myself."

What, have you not told her ? Men
were not so cautious when I was young''
chuckled the Baronet.

What had I to offer, sir ? And, besides,"
he added, growing crimson, " I have
no reason to believe that she cares in the
least for me. She is very gentle and kind,
but I have noticed that she is so to the
poorest man in the parish."

In the parish ! " repeated Sir Eichard,
regarding him intently. " You don't mean
to say  "

"Bob!" cried Horace, 'rit's Adela. I
see it all now. How I wish she would
have you. Oh ! shouldn't we all be
happy ? "

I wouldn't ask her," blurted out poor
Bob.

Then it is Scamp ! "

I'm not ashamed to own my love for
her, but, remember, I'm not going to tell
her of it unless better times come, although
in her trouble I have longed to ask her
to let me comfort her, longed to shield
her in some measure from the hard corners
of life, which seem to grow sharper
as troubles increase ; but I will never
ask a oirl like Adela to undergo a life
of poverty for my sake," he added, with
feeling.

Sir Richard had been staring blankly at
the speaker for some time. Then he rose,
and paced the room with bent head and
downcast eyes.

If it could be, it would be best so,"
he murmured. "If ever I let another
thought creep in, it was folly  folly, utter
folly. It would settle the whole question.
Yes ; it would be best so ! "

Suddenly he stopped by Bob's chair,
and laid his hand kindly upon the young
man's shoulder.

My boy, if Adela loved you she would
follow you to the world's end if you had
not a penny in your pocket. She is a
noble girl. I know none other like hero



not even my own daughter. Still I respect
your scruples, and poverty shall not
stand in your way. As soon as you have
taken priest's orders, and are alle to hold
it, the living of Winsthorpe shall be yours.
I had intended this before I was aware of
your adoration for my young favourite.
Now I have double pleasure in bestowing
it upon you. It would be a happy life
for the dear girl to follow in the honourable

and honoured footsteps of her parents.
She loves the Rectory  every tree and
shrub and flower. Every brick has a
meaning for her beyond others. She will
be glad to stay in her old home if she
can care for you. If she does not, nothing
will tempt her. In confidence, it
was my intention that she and Mrs Thorn-dyke
should not leave their beloved home.
I meant to have given the old place to
them, and to have built a new Rectory-house
near the church. Should Adela accept
you, this will become unnecessary,
for I am sure you would not desire to
part her mother from her, and I should
expect you to give Mrs Thorndyke a
suite of apartments for her own use, j\Ir
Bob."

Robert Lake's colour came and went-like
a girl's, through his fair skin. Hf
could not believe his own ears  could not
believe that at twenty - four he was to

hold a good living, to be able to ask
Adela to be his wife, to offer her her
dear old home, to remain near his own
father and mother and Horace, and the
people he had learnt to love !

He could scarcely find a word wherewith
to thank his benefactor, but the
Baronet liked him none the less for that
fact.

Do you really mean it, sir ? " he
faltered ; "it seems all too bright for
reality."

I never say what I don't mean, lad,"
returned Sir Richard kindly ; "so you
may go home, and dream about it with
safety."

Bob, I congratulate you with all my
heart ! " cried Horace, seizing him by the
hand, and shaking it as though its dislocation
were his one object in life. '' If
only Scamp will say yes ! but don't hope
too much for that. Anyway, you're the

luckiest young parson I know. Fancy
your becoming the Rector of Wins-thorpe
at twenty-four ! Won't Lilian be
pleased ? "

"I hope she will," said the Baronet,
smiling.

T think so. I wondered often she
didn't ask the favour herself"

"None of us ever dreamed of such a
piece of good fortune," said Horace. "And,
Sir Richard, I don't know how to thank
you for all your kindness to Bob, and
to me too, during the last year and a
half. It has been a truly happy time tome."


"Thank me by acts, lad, not by words.
Continue to make my little girl as happy
as you are now doing, and I shall be
satisfied. I shall require no further proof
of your gratitude ; and, Horace, my boy,
I have ceased to regret Lilian's choice.
You're a good and honest fellow."

A sunbeam seemed to pass over the
young man's face.

Those are the best words T have
ever heard in my life, sir ! " he exclaimed,
with emotion. " Next to when my darlings
confessed her love to me, I thought
nothing could make me happier save the
right to call Lilian my wife ; but now
I know that I was wrong, for you have
lifted from my heart its last regret. Intime,
sir, I earnestly hope you will learn
to regard me as a son."

' My lad, I do so already. Indeed,
I have done so for a long time, but I
have been too proud to acknowledge the
fact, after my long opposition ; but that
dear girl's sweet sad face softened me,
and I made up my mind I would tell
you so to-night."

You mean Adela's ? "

Yes, Horace. There is no other living
face so sweet, and sad, and bright, by

turns, and every mood seems to suit her
best. I thought she never appeared so
beautiful as she did to-night in her sable
garments ; her look was utterly spiritiielle !
If that young rascal gains her, he must
be born under a lucky star indeed."

I know it, sir, and I am not very
hopeful at present'' said Bob. " Adela
may in time get to like me, but I am
not very sanguine about it."

The old man shook his head.

I don't believe in that sort of courtship,
lad. Love is spontaneous. If she
has no thought of you now, she never
will have."

Men have overcome even dislike, sir ;
and have gained the love they desire in
the end," said Bob warmly.

'' Perhaps ! Better dislike than indifference.
Moreover, they gain affection,
not love, and it is not gained from such
girls as Adela Thorn dyke. There is

nothing lukewarm about her. There are
women who are little better than machines.
They marry the first man who asks them
and one is as capable of making them
contented as another."

You are right, sir," said Horace. " If
Adela does not really care for Bob, he
may give it up at once. Time will never
change her."

I think, like myself, you understand
her, my boy," said Sir Richard approvingly.
" And now, young gentlemen,
I've had enough of you both. Go home
to bed, the pair of you. Robert, I wish
you joy ; and you, my lad, a continuance
of it," as he g-ave Horace a bright nod
and a slap on his shoulder.

Then he shook the young Curate's hand
and almost turned them out of the
house.

They are both good lads," he murmured,
as he went upstairs to his bedchamber,

" and there is real pleasure in
giving happiness."

Papa, is anything the matter ? " asked
Lilian, fluttering out of her room in her
pretty dressing-gown.

Nothing, my child, except that you
ought to be in bed and asleep," he said
decidedly.

I have been listening for Horace to
go," she returned. " I never knew him
stay so late after I had gone, and I feared
something might be wrong''

"Ah! you thought you were the only
attraction in the house, did you, lassie ?
and you may yet learn that you have to
be jealous of your old father, for Horace
and I are growing very fond of each other."

*' I am so, so glad, father dear," she
said softly, as she clung to his arm, and
looked lovingly in his face. '' He is a
dear old fellow, is he not ? "

Yes, child, he's a good lad."

' And you don't wonder that I love him
so dearly ? "

Not very greatly," he returned, with
a smile, as he kissed her. "Go to bed,
my dear. Where will your roses be tomorrow
? Did you leave your friends
comfortable ? "

Comfortable, yes ! But oh ! father, I
cannot bear to look at Dela. She never
says a word, but I really believe that her
heart is breaking."

Poor girl, poor girl, I wish I knew
how to make her happy."

"And I."

"Lilian, are you in her confidence?"

No, papa ; and if I were, I could not
betray it."

Then we must pray to a higher
power to help her, my dear ; it is all we
can do."

Yes, I fear so ! " replied Lilian sadly,
and they bade each other good-night.

"Horace," said his brother, in a low
voice, as they walked home side by side,
you have known Adela so long, do you
think I have any chance ? "

*' ' Faint heart never won fair lady,' old
boy. She is worth trying for," returned
he cheerfully.

Ay ! but you don't think she cares
for me ? "

How on earth should I know ? "

"You  you don't think she loves anyone
else ? " he questioned anxiously.

"Would she be likely to tell me if she
did?"

I don't know ; you have always been
such friends, or Lilian might have told
you.

"Neither Lilian nor Adela have told
me anything, Bob, old boy ; so you can
but hope, and, remember, if Dela won't
have you, there are as good fish in the
sea as ever came out of it."

"Could you have comforted yourself
with that idea, Horace, if Lilian had said
no to you ? " asked Eobert, with a sad
smile.

*' No, Bob, I couldn't ; and that's a fact."

I thought not, no more can I," replied
the other brokenly.

And the rest of the way the brothers
walked on in silence.

In their father's hall they clasped hands.

Don't lose heart, old boy," whispered
Horace ; " your can still hope."

"Yes, I can hope," returned the other,
but he did not go up to bed with so
liorht a heart as he ouorht to have done
as the future Rector of Winsthorpe.

VOL. II.

SIR RICHARDS RUSE.

[DEL A, innocent of the affectionate
adoration of the young
Curate, so soon to be made
Rector in her father's stead, received him
in the kindliest spirit, fearing to damp
his pleasure by seeming to grudge him
the position which her own dear one could
no longer hold.

Both she and Mrs Thorndyke were
truly glad that the j)ooi' of Winsthorpe,
who had so long been their care, should
have so kind and good a pastor as Robert

Lake had proved himself to be during
those trying months when Mr Thorndyke
had been among them, and yet unable to
attend to his duties.

He had shown both zeal and tact and
patience, winning the good opinion of all
around him ; and they felt that it would
be his pride to follow out all the plans
and washes of his predecessor, and to
keep things going upon the same footing
as they had been.

Adela warmly entered into all his
thoughts and feelings about parish matters,
and evinced more signs of life and
energy than she had done since the blow
fell, which had at the same time been
both expected and unexpected.

She congratulated Sir Eichard upon his
wisdom in having selected Eobert Lake,
young though he was ; and the Baronet
smiled, sadly enough, but still he smiled.

Perhaps, after all, it was the young

Curate who had made a captive of the
girl's heart, since it was not Lord Carruthers,
as he had imagined ; and of course,
if so, his position, or the want of it, would
fully account for there being no engagement
between them, as well as
for both the young people pining in
secret.

And yet, good as Eobert was, and
honest and kind, he was scarcely the man
Sir Richard would have pictured as the
one to gain and enchain the heart of his
favourite.

He felt that he should be more than
glad when something should be settled.

In six months his promise to Lilian
and Horace must be fulfilled. He must
part from his child.

His mind was filled with half-formed
desires, and shadowy resolves, concerning
them both ; but before he could really
look the matter in the face, of one thing he

was determined  to do his best to settle
some future for Adela and her mother.

He would wait now until Winsthorpe's
future Rector should plead his cause. If
she should accept him, the matter would
be soon arranged. If not, it was still left
for him to see to their comfort, which as
the Hector's old friend he would willingly
have done, even if Adela had not been
his beau ideal of living women.

But as it was, he felt it would be an
equal pleasure to him to secure happiness
to her as it would have been, had she been
his own daughter.

Horace, looking on, felt hope for his
brother grow.

Adela was so bright with him, so different
from the pathetic-faced Adela whom
he oft-times found when alone.

He spoke of it to Lilian, and the girl
started.

"Robert loves our Dela ! " she exclaimed,

in astonishment. "" Well, poor old boy, I
do not wonder. I wish she could fancy
him, but if there were no other reason, I
should imagine he is too young for her ! "

Why, Lil, there is only one year between
us ! " Horace returned.

True, boy, but Bob is not you, you
know," and she turned a pair of saucy,
loving, brown eyes up to his face.

He stooped and kissed her.

'little flatterer," he whispered; "but
Bob is a better fellow than I am."

"It is quite right you should think so,"
she said, letting her hand wander among
his warm, curly hair, while the smile
deepened about her mouth ; " but / know
you're worth a dozen Bobs. Still he is a
good boy too, as being your brother, he
he could not fail to be ; but, Horace, dear,
it seems to me that Dela must have someone
very out of the common  Lord Carruthers
would have done for her."

"Evidently she did not think so,"
returned Lilian's lover mischievously, " for
she certainly could have had him if she
had so desired.

"That is true," she acknowledged reluctantly.


"Now, pet, cannot you suggest someone
else who is more suited to her than
poor old Bob ? " continued Horace
quizzically.

She remained in thought for awhile
then she looked up at him with a sudden
brightness.

Horace, do you remember Major
Egerton ? "

What ! the old young man who surprised
me giving Scamp a letter for you
in the tent ! who glared at me so murderously
that I began to think he was a rival
for your hand, darling ! Oh yes, I have
not forgotten him, and a precious 
fellow I thought him."

"Nonsense, dear; he was an eminently
handsome man, a symphony in autumn
tints, a picture man ! and a brave fellow
to boot."

Well ! all I can say is, he must have
looked at you with a very different expression
of countenance to that with which
he honoured me. I thought him dia
logical / " he retorted dogmatically.

Green eyes ! " laughed Lilian. "Major
Egerton is undeniably handsome ; but you
would never think any one good enough
for Dela, if it came to the point."

Yes, I should. I would like to see her
Bob's wife muche."

Of course ; then she would be your
sister, you old sinner. But I tell you that
poor old Bob will never gain her."

"I am sorry for it. The disappointment
will go near to breaking his heart ! " Then
he added suddenly,  "Lilian, if you know
anything, it will be only right to speak.

If Adela is already engaged, we must not
let poor old Eobert make himself ridiculous."


No, she is not engaged, dear ! " replied
Lilian sadly ; " of that I am certain,
but more I cannot say."

Horace had felt a little ruffled that
Lilian should place any other before his
brother as more eligible for the hand of
his old playmate, but it quickly wore off,
and he said warmly, 

Well, pet, watch them together. No
one arouses Adela from her lethargy like
Bob after all, and I think he has a
chance."

Lilian did watch them, and was bound
to confess that Horace was right.

Was it possible that Dela had forgotten
? Had she really determined tolet
the past rest and go into oblivion,
and to attempt a new path in life ?

She knew how she loved her old home,
VOL. II. , Q

and might not the fact that if she could
care for Bob she need never leave it, bean
inducement to her to accept the new
Rector for her husband ?

If even Adela's best friends began to
look upon the alliance as possible, need
it be wondered at that, hope increased
in the heart of her lover ?

He hovered about her path. He
brought her every scheme, every plan
and thought, in connection with Wins-thorpe,
to ask her advice and learn her
wishes upon it. And Adela. remembering
only what her father would have desired,
entered into it all for his dear sake, little
understanding the construction which was
being put upon her conduct.

And so things went on, but Bob never
found himself sufficiently at home with
her to plead his cause, and day by day
the Baronet interrogated him with word
or look, to receive the same answer.

I have never had the chance, sir."

*' Chance ! " repeated Sir Eichard
warmly. " When I was young, men
made opportunities, now they expect them
arranged for them. Very well, young
man, / must find you the chance, 1
suppose. Come here to lunch tomorrow,
and leave the rest to me."

So it turned out that the next morning
the Baronet sat down beside Adela
for a talk. Robert Lake had been asking
his help for a labourer, living some
miles distant, upon the very borders of
the parish, upon whom some timber had
fallen, rendering the poor fellow perfectly
helpless.

He had been carried to his poor home,
and had lain there for a month past in
an abject state of suffering and poverty,
his wife being unable to leave him and
her large family of little ones, to go out
to earn anything.

Adela," said Sir Eichard, " something
must be done for that poor fellow Jenkins,
his case is a pitiable one. Suppose we
drive over and see him this afternoon ? "

With pleasure, dear Sir Eichard," she
answered readily. "It is so little I can
do now, I am no longer in the groove to
be of use to any one. I shall be only too
glad to go with you ! "

*well, well, who knows how soon a
life of usefulness may again be yours, my
dear ? At any rate, we will see what we
can do to-day."

CHAP TEE I.

A RUNAWAY PONY.

IT the commencement of Sir Richard's
speech, Adela had glanced
up at him inquiringly, but the
finish seemed to satisfy her.

"At what time shall we start?" she
asked.

'' Let us say three o'clock ; that will
give the down train time to pass. You
must cross the line to get to Jenkins'

VOL. III. A

cottage, you know, and ' Fury ' objects
to steam power  nothing else makes him
carry out his cognomen. So, my dear,
return over the line at once, as there
are no other trains due till half-past
four. Then you will miss both ; when
you are at this side of the cutting again,
drive where you like," he added kindly.

'' You will be there to decide for yourself
and me ? " she returned, with a smile,
in which he joined.

** Oh ! ah ! yes ! of course, I was forgetting,"
he admitted, which was true,
but not quite in the sense she understood.


Winsthorpe's future Eector arrived between
twelve and one, and never before
had Adela found him so quiet and even
shy.

She told him of their contemplated
drive to the aid of his 'protege Jenkins,
which appeared to please him, but otherwise

he was undoubtedly ill at ease, and
his eyes turned restlessly towards the
door whenever it opened.

Sir Richard had promised that day to
make an opportunity for him to speak
to Adela, but this could not be it, for
Mrs Thorndyke sat there in her widow's
cap with her saddened face, and her everlasting
knitting.

She always carried it in her pocket,
and those many minutes which are usually
wasted by most of us, in her case represented
each Christmastide innumerable
warm stockings and socks for the poor.

And Lilian was there too, trying by
her lively sallies to cheer the mourners.

Luncheon was announced, and Sir
Richard joined them.

He, too, was unusually silent and
thoughtful, and none of the party felt
very sorry when the meal was over.

Well, lassie," he said, as they were

removing

away to the drawing-room,
member the pony will be at the door at
three. I know you like the little trap
better than what you call ' riding instate,'
" he laughed, and he signed to
Eobert Lake to follow him. *' Now," he
said, '' do you see your opportunity ? "

I can't say I do at present, sir ; and
if Miss Thorndyke is going out at three,
I don't know how I am to get her
alone."

Of course she is going out at three,
and you are going with her ; not I, as
she supposes. It had better seem an
accidental thing. Do you understand ? "

'* This is, indeed, kind of you.'

*' Kind ! Nonsense, it is the end of my
debt ; after this wee are quits. Master
Bob, and it will be your turn to help me."

Yes, if I only knew how, how gladly
I would," replied Eobert heartily.

Well, well ! the mouse helped the

lion, you know. Who can tell but that
some clay I may ask you to assist me;
and now you may go into the billiard-room
if you want a weed."

Thank you, no, sir, I don't smoke."
Never learnt the pernicious trick, eh ? "
I'm afraid I did, but I thought it
was a bad example, so I left it off when
I took holy orders. You cannot urge
the men to give up beer and tobacco if
you indulge in them yourself."

"But you are not a teetotaller?"
" No, I approve of a glass of wine or
beer with your meals ; that does no harm.
It is the intermediate drinking which
runs the men into mischief, not the half
pint, or even pint with their dinners at
home. It does not do to draw the rein
too tightly. It may snap."

You're right, Bob. You will do the
poor fellows more good by your sensible
view of the case than some of your

parish priests who wear so much starch
ill their neckcloths that they cannot turn
their heads, and can see only one road, the
one that they are travelling. And now
tell me, is Horace fond of his work ? "

He does it well and conscientiously,
sticks to it like a leech, but I don't
think he would ever have chosen office
work."

"Nor should I," chuckled the Baronet.
' He had better have turned parson, then
he could have had the living of Wins-thorpe
instead of you, Bob," and he gave
the other a decided dig in the ribs.
Well, mind you are in the hall to hand
Adela into the village-cart, young man,"
he said, as he looked at his watch. " I
have one or two things to see about
before you start." And with a nod Sir
Eichard left the room.

At five minutes to three Eobert Lake

went into the hall, and began gazing at
some of the valuable pictures hanging
there, with eyes that saw nothing of
their beauty.

Hallo ! youngster, you're all there,
are you ? " called the Baronet, when he
caught sight of him.

Robert laughed, in spite of himself.

Yes ! I'm quite all here, sir."

** Quite, eh ? Are you sure about that.
Master Bob ? "

The other coloured, but had no time
to answer, for the butler was coming
along the hall, and the sound of wheels
was approaching.

And soon after, Adela joined them,
looking pale, but still beautiful, in her
sable garments.

Well, my dear, are you ready ? "
exclaimed the Baronet, taking down his
hat and shaking himself leisurely into
his dust coat. " Help Miss Thorndyke

up, Lake; I'll be there directly," but
at that moment a note was placed in
his hands.

He sauntered to the carriage reading it,
and looked up at Adela, without a smile.

My dear," he said, " I cannot go
with you after all ; the news contained
in this letter claims my immediate attention.
However, poor Jenkins shall not
suffer. Lake will drive you over ; here
is my purse ; do what you think right
for him, and I shall be quite satisfied,
rest assured."

It was all done so naturally that a
more suspicious girl than Adela might
well have been deceived, and she certainly
had not the remotest idea but
that her old friend was going with her
until suddenly prevented by some unexpected
business matter.

Cannot I wait for you ? " she asked
kindly.

"No, my dear, I shall not be able
to manage a drive to-day ; it will be
best to keep to the arrangements we
had made, with only the change of
charioteer, unless you would like to drive
yourself, in which case I am sure Lake
won't object."

Not in the least," he said readily.

Then up you jump, sir ; and Adela,
remember, be back across the line before
half-past four."

Very well," she answered, with a
smile, and away sped the spirited little
pony as fast as his short legs could
carry him. She had never driven him
before, and she found him a very different
animal to manage from " Peggy,"
her father's quiet, well-worked little
quadruped, now grazing in the Eectory
field.

Fury's " mouth appeared to her to be
uncommonly hard, and his pace seemed

very fast after " Peggy's," but she enjoyed
passing swiftly through the air,
and he neither kicked nor shied, nor
otherwise misbehaved himself.

A sudden turn in the road brought
them to the line, and to Adela's astonishment
the gates were closed across it,
and before she could realise the danger,
an express train dashed through.

In one moment, " Fury " had twisted
round like an eel, and was galloping
home fast and excitedly, with his bit
between his teeth.

She had kept her seat, but the place
beside her was vacant.

BOB LAKES WOOING.

fT was all Aclela could do to
guide the terrified animal, who
ran recklessly along the familiar
road to the Hall. She had not lost her
presence of mind, and was enabled to
keep him clear of the sharp angles round
which he rushed.

The entrance gates were fortunately
open, and 'fury" flew up the drive,
turning ofi" for the stable-yard, where
Sir Eichard was standing talking to the
head groom.

Suddenly, to his surprise, the man
bolted from his side ; he had caught a
glimpse of the runaway pony through
the trees.

He ran to the gate and shouted
*' Woa I " and " Fury " seemed to recognise
his voice, for he slackened his pace,
and the man was able to catch him by
the rein, running by the side himself,
and laying his weight upon the little
creature's neck, while he spoke to him,
which helped to quiet him, so that they
arrived in the stable-yard at a jog trot.

Sir Richard turned pale as he looked in
Adela's white face, for in truth she had
had her nerves at full tension so long that
she was scarcely able to bear any extra
strain upon them.

'* In Heaven's name, what has happened,
my dear ? " he asked, in an agitated
tone. " Have you met with any accident ?
"What have you done with Lake ? "

That is the worst part of it, Sir Richard,"
returned the girl anxiously. " I do
not know what has become of Mr Lake
We got on very well till we reached the
line ; and, of course, not expecting any
train, I was not on the look-out for one,,
but no sooner had we got near the gates,
than an express flew by ; round whizzed
Fury,' and all I know is, that poor Robert
no longer filled the place by my side. He
must have been thrown out by the sudden
jerk the pony gave. I had my work
carved out to keep him to the road. As
to pulling him up, it was impossible ; I
believe he had the bit between his
teeth."

More than likely ; he is perfectly quiet
if you avoid trains, as I told you, but if he
once catches sight of one, he's the devil
I beg your pardon, my dear."

Oh 1 I don't mind," returned Adela,
with a smile ; " but oh ! Sir Eichard, what

if I have hurt or killed Horace's brother ?
I don't think either ' Fury ' or the trap are
injured."

Not in the least, and we will hope the
best about Bob Lake. Here, Johnston,
take one of the men with you, and go and
look after Mr Lake ; if he is all right he
can jump up, and the man can walk home."

Johnston touched his hat respectfully,
readjusted the pony's bit and bridle, and
led him across the yard, then calling a
light-made, active lad to his side, bade him
fetch his hat and coat, and in less than
two minutes " Fury " was retracing his
steps down the drive, with a stronger hand
on the reins than Adela's.

'* My dear," said Sir Richard, with emotion,
as he offered her his arm, " I can only
thank Heaven that you are safe ; had any
harm overtaken you, Adela, it would have
broken my old heart."

Don't say that, dear friend. All things

are fated, I believe ; and if it had been my
destiny to be killed, life does not hold so
many joys that you need have regretted
helping me accidentally over the borderland
into a better," she answered sadly.

*' My dear, don't talk so ; it grieves me
to see you so despondent."

Does it ? Then I will try and keep
my feelings to myself"

'' I can't understand about that train,"
remarked Sir Eichard irrelevantly. '' None
ought to have passed at that hour ; it must
have been a special. I would not have let
you go that way on any account if I had
not thought it was quite safe, you may be
sure."

I hope Mr Lake is safe," said Adela
fervently. " I wonder I was not thrown
out too, the jerk was so sudden."

I trust so, indeed ; he is a good young
fellow."

*' He is, truly," she replied warmly. " If

my dear father could have named his own
successor, I believe his choice would have
fallen upon Eobert Lake. He endeared
himself to our beloved one so much by his
kindness and unselfishness."

I am glad," said the Baronet simply ;
and now, my dear, if I were you I would
keep this little matter from your poor
mother ; it would only upset her sadly,
and do no good. Go into my study and
rest awhile, and I will bring you the first
news of the young man," and he led Detain
by the French window which opened
upon the terrace, and placed her in his
own easy-chair.

Then he went into the dining-room, and
secured a bottle of champagne and a glass,
and some macaroons, and went back.

You must drink Bob's good healthy
Adela," he remarked, as he sent the cork
spinning to the further end of the room
with a loud report. " There, it is useless

for you to say no, my dear ; I know what
is good for you far better than you do, and
you will not vex me, I am certain."

He poured out the wine as he spoke
and held the glass to her lips.

"You have had a nasty shake, child,
and need picking up."

His words of thoughtfulness brought
a rush of tears to her eyes.

Don't be kind to me ! " she said, in
an agitated voice ; *' tell me I'm a silly,
weak-minded creature. I try so  so hard
not to break down, indeed I do."

Never mind me, Adela, I could never
think you anything but the best of girls,
whatever you may do, and tears are a
relief sometimes."

He placed his arm about her, and
laid her head upon his breast in a gentle,
fatherly manner, and let her trouble
have its way, and soon the sobs became
fewer and fewer.

VOL. III. B

Then he made her drink down quickly
a glass of the wine he had brought her,
and placed her once more in his own
chair, sitting beside and holding her
hand, and talking to her in his own
kind, strange way, until he heard the
faint sound of wheels.

Then he went quietly out, and after
a few minutes he returned with a smiling
face, and a second glass in his hand.

"Bob's all right," he laughed. ''He
says you turned him out most neatly,
and he's as lively as a cricket."

'' Is he not hurt at all ? " she asked,
in a tone of relief.

He has twisted his wrist a bit ; he
fell with his weight upon it, and he is
a lucky fellow to have got off so cheaply."

I am sorry about his wrist, but
thankful it is no worse. Does he think
it was my bad driving which caused
the accident ? "

"No, no, of course not. He thinks
you showed great pluck, and so do I.
It would have been all right but for that
wretched train ; as it is, I am the person
to blame for letting you drive that rascal
'Fury.' If he had hurt you, I should
have had him shot, believe me ! "

I am glad he did not, for he is a
pretty little fellow ! "

' Handsome is as handsome does.'
If he can't behave himself, I must find
a pony who wil."

'* Oh ! he went very nicely till he was
frightened. Poor little wretch, I believe
he was really scared."

Yes, I have no doubt he thought his
Satanic majesty was after him I " laughed
Sir Eichard.

*' And no wonder ; a train is really
an awful - looking things. If we did not
understand it, we should be alarmed too,
I expect."

Don't make excuses for him, Dela ;
he ought to have got used to the sight
by now. Fll have him turned into the
field beside the line to punish him."

'that will be much better than shooting
him, and will probably cure him intime."


"Now here comes Lake, Adela. You
had better bandage up his wrist for
him ; and while I go and get you one
from the housekeeper, you must give
him some champagne, and keep him
in countenance, my dear ; for it is most
unsociable to make a man sip his wine
alone ; and here are some macaroons, I
know you like them."

AVhat a memory you have!" she
returned brightly, and he left the room
as Bob Lake entered it.

"I am so thankful you were not more
hurt ! " said Adela, kindly rising to meet
him as he crossed the room.

*' Never mind me," he said earnestly.
I do hope the fright has not upset you,
Adela ? "

"Yes, I'm afraid I was rather
cowardly," she replied, with a smile ;
"but I got home all right, and now I
am thankful it is all over. Poor Jenkins;
I am afraid he won't get his money
to-day."

Yes he shall," said Sir Eichard,
entering with the bandage. ** We will
go over in the barouche later in the
afternoon. I shall be at leisure by then !
you can go with us or not, Lake, as you
like best when the time comes. Shall
we say half-past five ? That will give
the ladies time for their afternoon tea,
and me to get through my business,"
and he bustled off again at once.

What a kind old man he is," said Adela
softly.

Indeed I ought to agree with you ; he

has done a great deal for me and Horace,"
he replied, with feeling.

Quite true," she returned, smiling ;
and now I must obey his orders, and
make you take some champagne, and have
a little myself to bear you company."

And she suited the action to the word.

' I make it a rule not to take anything
between meals," he laughed ; " but this is
a very especial occasion, so I don't think
I'll say no, for I don't feel quite sure of
my own identity ; my head runs round a
little."

I'm so sorry," she said regretfully.

Are you really, Adela ? " he asked
earnestly.

"Yes, really and truly," she returned
heartily ; " and I'm so afraid your wrist
will cause you suffering. Finish your wine,
and I will bandage it for you with cold
water."

"I shall not mind the pain one straw if

it causes you to think kindly of me," he
began.

Of course I think kindly of you," she
replied innocently, handing him the glass.
Now finish that up, and let me get to
my work. I know how to pass a bandage,
so you need not be afraid of my lack of
skill." And she began with agile and
light fingers to arrange it scientifically,
so as to make it more comfortable. "Is
that easier ? " she asked, smiling up at
him.

Adela, I would gladly suffer pain
every day to have an angel like you to
minister to me," he said, in a low voice,
taking her hand, and holding it firmly in
his. And something in the expression of
his face kept her silent, much as she
longed to laugh off his remark. "Adelaide
continued fervently, " I cannot think
how it is that I have not been your friend
as Horace has been from childhood. I

conclude it is because I went away to
school, and he did not ; at any rate I
have learnt to grudge him all the happy
days which he has passed by your
side.

Tom and I used to laugh at him for
his friendship for girls, but we were
wrong;. It has made him a more attractive,
gentler fellow than we are, and I,
for one, know what we have both lost.
I seem somehow to have never really
known you, Adela, notwithstanding all
the years we have been acquainted, until
I became your dear father's curate. Then
my eyes were opened, and I saw what
womanhood ought to be.

From that time I vowed to try and
be worthy of such a friend, and, Adela, I
have gained your goodwill, but now that
will not satisfy me. I have seen what a
treasure you are, dear one, and is it
strange that I should covet it for my

own? I know I am not good enough for
you, that you will have many better fellows
at your feet, who can offer you
richer homes, even titles ; but, darling,
you will never find a man to love you
more truly or fervently than I do, and
the whole object and aim of my life shall
be to make you happy, and to act and
live as you would have me do.

"And now, Adela, I can have the joy,
not only of asking you to be my wife,
and allow me the privilege of protecting
you from the cares of life, but I can offer
you back the home you love, and have
loved so long ; and, darling, your mother
will have a hearty welcome there. I
should never wish to part you from her.
She does not dislike me, I am sure, and
one day she may learn to lean on meas
though I were her own son. Delay
dear girl, may I hope for your
love ? "

She held up her hands with a pathetic
gesture.

"Oh, hush!" she murmured; "I never
thought of this, Bob, never ! "

Think of it now, dearest ; I will not
be impatient. I fancied you must have
felt, must have known my devotion, but
if I have been too abrupt, if I have
startled you, I can wait. Only let me
have hope that by-and-by your decision
will be in my favour. Adela, think of
it. I have woven you into all my
schemes for doing good, all my thoughts
and plans for dear old Winsthorpe seem
centred in you ; help me to bring them
to perfection. "Without you I shall be
but a one-handed man ! " he said, with
emotion.

Adela covered her eyes with her hands.
She could not bear to look into his young,
pleading face, and know that she must bring
the shadow of disappointment upon it.

She would have closed her ears to his
earnest words, as she had shut her eyes,
had it been possible, for each one went
to her heart with a cruel pain.

He asked her to carry on with him
her dead father's work, and it seemed to
her as though his dear voice joined Bob
Lake's, and urged it also.

Her mother too ! She could secure her
the home to which she was so deeply
attached.

She fairly groaned.

"Oh ! Bob ! " she answered with real
sorrow upon her speaking face, " what
could make you think of such a
thing ? You and Horace are like
brothers to me. How could we, be anything
else ? "

I can never be a brother to you,
Adela," he returned gently. " I love
you with a very different sort of feeling
to that. Darling, tell me you will be

my wife, let me try and make you your
once bright self again."

Oh ! never, never ! " she moaned.
I can never again be that."

"Then I will uncomplainingly share
your sadness, dear one."

"Bob, put the idea from your mind,"
she returned firmly, but gently. " It can
never be."

Do not say so, dear girl ; think before
you decide. My avowal was unexpected,
by-and-by you will see things in a
different light."

Never, Bob ! "

Oh ! Adela, you will break my heart,"
he said, with a bitter cry. "You cannot
realise the disappointment you are causing
me."

Nor you, my friend, the way you
are tempting me to do wrong. Bob, if
I could only say I loved you, or even
that I might grow to love you, I might

accept the life I should prefer to any-other,
which could be offered me. I
might ensure my mother comparative
happiness, and feel that my dear father
was looking down with joy at my
choice."

"And feeling all this, you say no?"
asked Bob in surprise."

Yes 1 I say no, I can say nothing else."

Am I then so utterly obnoxious to
you ? " he cried, with bitter reproach.

Don't, don't, dear old Bob ; if I had
a brother I could scarcely love him better
than I do you ; but even as you could
never care for me as though I were your
sister, so I can never feel for you as a
woman should do for her husband ; and
without such love on both sides, believe
me, life together would be living
death ! "

Am I to shut away all hope then ? "
he asked.

"Do, there's a dear fellow, it is useless
to hope for the unattainable."

Adela, what is your future to be ? "

I often ask myself the same question.
I hardly see myself at present, but I
think I could write, if I could get my
works taken, and with the little we have
we might manage."

He turned from her abruptly.

I cannot bear it ! " he exclaimed
passionately ; " the thought that you are
going to fight the battle of life alone is
too much for me. My dear one, if you
could but make up your mind to let me
try and give you happiness  "

She stopped him.

My good old Bob, you only give me
pain ; the world holds but one man who
could have commanded my love."

And he ? "

Did not think it worth the having,"
she said bitterly. " I know what are

your feelings, Bob  oh, so well !  and I
feel for you most keenly, but I cannot
change any more than you can ; the cases
are parallel."

Not so ; he is not worthy of one
thought, Adela, while you  I should like
to have his punishment in my hands."

She looked up at the tall slight youth,
and smiled.

I don't think you could do much
against him," she said.

Eio;ht is might," he answered. *' I
wish I could have the chance."

You must not think ill of him, Bob ;
I love him still."

He shrank from her words.

I did not mean to pain you," she
said gently, as she laid her hand upon
his arm ; " and you must not pain me !
I cannot bear to hear him harshly spoken
of"

Then Bob rose. All the light had died

out of his bright young face  all the joy
seemed to have passed out of his life.

"If you say my dream must be at an
end, Miss Thorndyke, I must obey you ;
but not to love you is beyond my power.
There will never be a mistress to Wins-thorpe
Eectory."

Nonsense, Bob ! You are too young
to speak like that."

Am I younger than you are ? "

No ; but men are different to women.
Love is a woman's life ; a man's pastime."

You will find when your hair is grey,
Adela, that my love is unchanged ; and
remember, in all the years to come, it is
yours if you will accept it ; and remember,
too, that there is a home ever
ready for you, and loving arms whereinto
shelter, should you find the world too
cold and unsympathetic. My de!ir girl,
may Heaven bless you, and keep you
from all sorrow."

Then he took her hands in his, and
holding them tightly, looked into her sad
eyes ; and the pain in his so troubled her
that she could not answer him one word ;
and he turned from her with bent head.
The door shut, and she was alone.

VOL. III.

m

SIE RICHARD S TREASURES.

OW long she sat there she knew
only by the appearance of Sir
Richard.

I have been looking for you in the
drawing-room, my dear," he said kindly.
** How is it you did not join your mother
and Lilian at afternoon tea ? "

Do they know I am at home ? "
she asked, with a hasty glance at
him.

'* They would have done so had you
gone in," he returned, with a smile ; " as

it is, I thought the least said the soonest
mended, so I did not mention you."

You are always so thoughtful," she
replied gratefully.

My dear ! what have you done with
Bob Lake ? Is he not coming with us ? "

A troubled look crossed Adela's white
brow, and a tender, pink hue flitted over
her cheeks.

I think he went home," she answered.

The Baronet regarded her for an instant
attentively ; then replied, as though his
presence or absence was a matter of indifference
to him, 

*' Well, my dear, we must do without
him, and you must put up with an old
man for company."

I could not wish for better," she
answered readily. " People are so apt to
mistake one, but you always understand
me, old friend."

Of course I do," he assented, putting

her through no catechism with regard to
her somewhat peculiar remark, for which
she felt grateful, and soon after, they set
out for the cottage of the poor man they
desired to succour.

Adela was looking pale and careworn
when they started, but the Baronet's
friendly chat soon placed her at her ease,
and the fresh spring air brought a healthful
colour to her cheeks.

But, for all Sir Eichard was cheerful
and amusing as usual, he was all the time
wondering what had taken place between
his young friends. One fact was evident.
Bob had left her immediately after the
interview ; he had gone without one word
of farewell to him  his host, even ; and
surely that boded no good for the poor
lad.

As for Bob, Adela s refusal had hit him
hard. He had placed all his eggs in one
basket. His whole mind had been set

upon gaining lier love, and nothing else
would do for him  nothing less could
make him happy. His pleasure in Sir
Eichard's generous gift was now blown to
the four winds of heaven. His castles
were become heaps of ashes. He had
believed in their foundation, but he had
been mistaken.

That night he resolved to quit Wins-thorpe
for ever, to refuse the living, and
to go to India as a missionary.

He even went so far as to prepare a
letter to Sir Richard Freemantle, telling
him of his decision ; but during the long
watches of the night he put the temptation
from him.

He had promised Adela to carry on her
father's work, and no personal disappointment
should make him shrink from
keeping that promise.

He had, moreover, told her that his love
would always be hers, and he had offered

8 Scamp,

her the shelter of his heart and home if
ever she should need them.

Could he thus receive her as a missionary
in India or elsewhere ? Could he in anyway
watch over her, if he were thousands
of miles away ? He knew he could not;
so he tore his letter into pieces, and sat
down to write another.

'dear Sie Richards"' he said,  "You
will have guessed, by my sudden
departure, that bitter disappointment
has been my portion. So bitter, that
last night I thought to ask you to give
the living of Winsthorpe to another. But
I have fought the battle with myself,
and see that it is my duty to stay here
if you still desire it ; but I think it only
right to tell you, after the opinion you
expressed to me about the need of a lady
at the Rectory, that I shall never now
marry, unless Miss Thorndyke should

change her mind, which is most unlikely.
With your permission, I will get someone
to do the duty here for a time.

I will then take my priest's orders,
so as to be able, when I can face Wins-thorpe
again, to enter on my duties fully.
If you should, upon consideration, not
think it desirable to have me in the
parish, if you think my presence will in
any way be disagreeable to Miss Thorndyke,
do not hesitate to tell me so at once.
With grateful thanks for your kindness, 
Yours sincerely, Eobeet Lake."

This letter was placed in Sir Richard's
hands the next morning, and he perused
it thoughtfully.

Poor lad," he murmured ; " if he cannot
have his bread buttered, it would be
hard indeed to take away the loaf. No,
no ! Adela is too good to desire such a
sacrifice from him. However, I will ask

her. Somehow I did not think she would
accept him. It would have settled matters
comfortably for them both, and I'm sorry
for Bob ; but he is young and will get
over it. It is harder for the old to
forget."

Adela's affairs seemed to trouble Sir
Richard sorely. He might almost be said
to be an altered man. All his business
habits with regard to the estate, etc., were
broken through. He was always trying
to invent something new to interest his
young favourite. He was fitful in his
moods too. At times he seemed to have
grown young again.

k new life, a fresh vigour, appeared to
have come to him. At others he was
silent, taciturn, and thoughtful.

It was about a week after he had
received Bob's letter, to which he had
sent off a few lines of reply only, telling
him that he had no wish to change his

intention of appointing him Eector of
Winstliorpe, and adding a kind word in
reference to his disappointment ; but still
he had had no opportunity of an uninterrupted
tete-astute, with Adela. It came to
him, however, at last.

Mrs Thorndyke had a headache, and
was in her room with closed blinds.

Lilian had gone to see her future mother-in-law,
and Adela was sitting alone in the
library, writing, when Sir Richard opened
the door and looked in.

My dear, shall I disturb you ? " he
questioned.

Not a bit," she answered readily. " I
have been trying my hand at an ' article,'
but my brains are wool gathering, I
think."

'that is one of the things I want to
talk to you about," he said gently. " You
are not strong enough for literary work.
To obtain either money, or a name, you

must devote your whole time and attention
to it ; you must write many hours
daily, and after the free life you have
been accustomed to lead, you will find
the constant application and confinement,
both harassing and trying."

'' I can quite believe it," she answered,
almost wearily ; " but beggars cannot be
choosers, and we must live!'

My dear, you need never say that,
while your old friend Richard Freemantle
is alive," he said, with feeling.

You are very good to me," she replied
gently ; '' but it is necessary now that I
should find work, since my old line of
usefulness is gone. We were meant todo
something with our lives ; we were
never intended to cumber the ground as
idlers."

Adela, I hope you will forgive me,
if I speak to you upon a subject which
is painful to you," he said, as he drew

a chair to her side ; " but I have had
a letter from Bob Lake."

She coloured vividly, but did not
reply.

Are you sure, my dear, that you
could not make up your mind to return
to your old life ? "

Ah ! if I could, if I could ! But the
past can never return."

No, but there would only be one
difference. Instead of a daughter of the
house, you would be the mistress."

The only difference I " she echoed, with
such a tone of pain that he winced. " Oh I
Sir Eichard, I did not expect to hear you
speak like that. I thought you at least
understood me."

There was a strange struggle going on
upon his expressive features.

Well," he said, " I was only wishing
to see you happy, Adela. I would do
anything to ensure that ; but, child, I am

totally in the dark. Remember, with all
our friendship, you have never given me
your confidence, and without that I seem
powerless to assist you. First I thought
that you and Carruthers really cared for
each other, and that some trifle had
occasioned a misunderstanding between
you, but it seems I was wrong."

*' Oh ! quite, quite wrong ; his lordship
and I are real friends, nothing more. I
hope he never suspected sour ideas about
him," she continued anxiously. " It must
be so humiliating and annoying to a man
to feel that any one suspects he is not
appreciated in that way."

Carruthers and I have never exchanged
a word upon the subject that I remember,
and had we done so he would have
known that I am to be trusted."

** Of course," said Adela, "I did not
mean that, indeed."

Well, could, being out in my reckoning,

I thought when I found out how
devoted poor old Bob was to you, that
you might be happy in your old life in
your old home."

** No, no, it could not be."

So I find, my dear, and I am charged
with a message from the lad. He does
not wish to annoy you by his presence ;
if you would prefer it, he will give up this
living, and go elsewhere. It is not the
only one in my gift, Adela, and I need
hardly tell you that he shall not suffer by
the exchange."

She gave him a startled look.

Oh ! he has promised me that he will
carry out all my dear father's work. Do
not let him go away, Sir Richard. Make
him understand that I shall think of him
just as I used to do ; that I will gladly
help him should we remain in this neighbourhood,
if only he will never again refer
to our last interview. It is all I ask, and

I see no reason why we should not befriends
still."

''I will convey your message, my dear,"
said the Baronet kindly. " As to your
leaving Winsthorpe, that is out of the question,
Adela ; we could not do without you,
and, moreover, your poor mother has taken
too deep a root in the parish for her friends
ever to think of allowing her to be removed
from it."

'' Perhaps you are right, dear Sir Richard,"
she returned thoughtfully ; " but a
residence will be the difficulty."

" Leave that to me, my dear," he replied
kindly. '' Your visit here must bea
long one ; before it is ended some of my
houses may need tenants  who knows ? "

Adela shook her head.

*ewe should have heard of it, if any one
had intended to leave," she said.

I'm not so sure of that," he answered,
with a merry twinkle in his eye.

She looked at him in astonishment.

Oh ! do tell me where it is," she asked.
I know every house and cottage in the
parish, and I can't imagine."

" No, no, lassie, you must bide your
time ; do not fret as to a future residence,
that is all."

** Do I know it % " she persisted.

Undoubtedly."

And like it ? "

*' I think I can answer yes to that also,
but it is the last query I shall reply to.
I do not mean to say any more," he
laughed. " And now, Adela, I am going
to fulfil a promise I made you long,
long ago. I am going to take you to
my sanctum, to see my dear wife's
picture."

'' Are you % " she cried, a sudden light
springing to her eyes. " I am so glad ; I
have so longed to see it, but I did not like
to ask. I thought some day you might remember,"

and she rose eager to accompany
him.

*' I have never forgotten," he said, " but
I wanted to wait till we might go in quite
alone, and unobserved, to have no comments
made upon my actions."

** Has not Lilian seen it yet, then ? "
she asked, in sudden surprise.

No, not yet ; she shall do so upon her
wedding-day. I want her to remember it."

She could not forget," answered Adela
gently.

I hope not, child, and now shall we
go?"

He clasped her hand, and led her along
as though she were what he had just called
her.

They ascended the stairs, and paused
before a door, and taking a key from his
pocket, he unlocked it, and they entered,
and Adela looked around her almost with
awe.

This room, dedicated to the memory of
the dead, was on one side fitted up as an
oratory, and here the husband and wife
had day by day knelt together at their
devotions.

A beautiful painted window threw a
soft, subdued light into the room. A
silver crucifix hung against the wall, upon
a background of purple velvet, and beneath
it was a table covered with the
same material, upon which were books
of prayer.

*' My darling was very High Church,"
he said gently. " I made this oratory
for her, and fitted it up to suit her
taste. These were the very books she
used," he continued, with emotion.
Every page speaks to me of her."

Then he turned Adela round, and she
almost started as she met the sweet sad
eyes of Sir Eichard's wife, which seemed
to be looking out from the canvas at her,

VOL. III. D

and she had a strange certainty they were
wonderfully like her own.

A small window was so arranged as to
throw the light upon the exquisite face,
and the lips appeared to smile as Delegated
upon the picture with silent wonder
and rapt admiration.

"How beautiful!" she murmured at
length. " Oh ! my friend, I don't think
I ever realised till now what you must
have suffered. Never have I seen such
a heavenly countenance ! " she ended
softly.

'you are right," he answered. "As
the fruit ripened, so Heaven's reflected
glory shone from her dear face ; like
Carlo Dolce's Christ, which is painted
upon gold, we are told ; and seems to
give out a strange brightness. But when
my darling was young, Adela, she was
very, very like you ; only fairer still.

It was this likeness which drew me

to you, even in childhood, and made you
one apart from the rest of the world tome,
and so you have remained ever
since," he added, with a deep pathos
touching' his voice. ''If I could have
faith in the doctrine of the transmigration
of souls, I should believe that her
gentle spirit had entered into your tiny
frame, but I see no Bible authority for
such fancies, nevertheless, you are like her
in disposition, as well as in countenance.

So I learnt to love you, dear, for her
sake ; and now I love you for your own,
and often I have come here to see
Whether her gentle spirit was grieved by
it, for I have the strange fancy that if
such were the case, it would seem to me
that she no longer smiled, and that hereat
least, I should feel and know if she
disapproved of aught I did.

But she does not disapprove, she
knows that my love for her will be

faithful to the end ; and yet my heart
has room for another in it, and one affection
is somehow engrafted on the other.
Adela, has it ever struck you how deeply
I love you ? "

She looked at him with a timid, uncertain
glance. He was not his usual self,
there was something eager, almost excited,
in his manner, which made her shrink
from him a little.

*' I thought I would tell you this herein
her dear presence, and ask you, for her
sake, to listen to an old man's pleading.
See how equally beautiful she was in
death, Adela  cruel death, which left me
desolate  how desolate, she only knows,
until you came to cheer me, dear ; gentle
death, which carried her into an eternity
of bliss. One can feel no doubts of her
happiness, looking upon her angel face.
Child ! is it not lovely ? "

He drew aside a curtain, and in the

further end of the room was a monument
carved in purest white marble.

There were sculptured figures of
mourners holding a canopy over a recumbent
form, and Adela saw at once
that it was a representation of Lady
Freemantle in her wedding dress ; even
the orange blossoms were carved upon it,
and a golden-hued window behind the
monument cast a halo upon the still
form, leaving all the rest in shadow.

'' I never saw anything so lovely ! "
she whispered, in a hushed voice.

On the front of the monument were
these words : 

LILY,

THE DEARLY-LOVED WIFE OF

Richard Freemantle, Bart.,
OF Marsden Hall.

Died 18  Aged 25.

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God."

Adela could not withdraw her eyes
from the sweet face before her, even
more beautiful in death than in life.

How glad Lilian will be to see these ! "
she said softly.

I hope she will," he answered ;
*' but now that you have been with me
into my holiest of holies, you will understand
why I could not take any one in,
who was thoughtless or lacking in love.
It would be like taking an unbeliever to
church."

*' I think I understand you," she answered.


Do you, Dela ? Only in part, I fear,"
and he closed the curtains carefully around
the beautiful monument.

Then he led her back into the oratory,
and placed a chair for her, taking another
himself opposite his dead wife's picture.

My dear," he said gently, " you have
become so much to me I cannot let you

go out of my life. Do you remember my
asking you long ago if a young girl might
grow to love an old man, and your
answer ? You said you thought it quite
possible. Adela, could you love an old
man  one who will be sadly lonely if
you say nay to him ?

'' My dear, cannot you make up your
mind to let Marsden Hall be your home ?
Your mother can remain here with all
my heart, or she shall retain the Eectory
for her own home ; and you shall share
alike in everything hereafter with Lilian.
You would lift a weight from my mind,
dear girl, if you could say ' yes ' tome
; and you would bring back the
brightness into a life which has been
long; dark. I know I am asking; a
tremendous sacrifice, dear ; but to the
end of my life I will strive to make you
know that joy which you will bring back
to me.

"I ask you here, with that sweet
angel face looking on, and feel that I
have her blessing ; that she wishes me
to be happy, to spend my last years in
peace and contentment, with loving hands
to minister to my needs. Have I scared
you, Adela ? You look simply shocked ! "
he said, with a smile.

"Oh 1 dear Sir Eichard, you cannot
mean what you have said ; you who are
so staunch and true, you who have
mourned your one love so many weary
years," she replied, in an agitated voice.

And I shall mourn her to the end,
child ; but is that any reason why I
should shut brightness out of my life ?
The night has been long and dark enough,
Dela. Is the morning to dawn into day
for me or no ? "

I cannot understand you," she murmured,
'sand I thought I knew you so
well I "

Adela, my dear, will you let me
take care of you for the few years I have
left ? " he asked, with emotion. " They
cannot be many. Will you cheer them
to the end, and let me shield you from
such troubles as I can ward off from
you ?

'' Am I to lose all my friends in this
way ? " she exclaimed passionately. " First
Lord Carruthers, then Bob, now you ! Oh !
dear Sir Eichard, do recall what you have
said. 1 have delighted so in your friendship,
and now  "

It shall never fail you, Adela, whatever
you may say to me."

Surely you did not dream ? " she
began, and stopped.

That 5ou could love me as I do
you ? No, Dela, but I thought you might,
and perhaps would, give me a deep and
true affection. I hoped you would listen
to an old man's prayer. I shall be very

desolate, my dear, if you close your heart
to me."

I could never do that, my dear, kind
friend, but I wish you had not spoken
such words to me. No, no. Sir Richard !
no other love must come between you
and your pure white lily hereafter, not
even the shadow of it. You have mistaken
your kind desire to provide for a
homeless orphan, for love, believe me. Forget
the wild fancy, and let us be what
we have ever been, the dearest, best of
friends. Knowing what your love for
her has been, I could not dispossess her
even in thought. Forgive me ; let us
never refer to the subject again, and let
us be the same helpful friends wee have
always been."

He sat very still for a long, long time,
with his face turned away from her.

Then he rose and kissed her very
gently.

"You have broken my day-dream,
Adela," he said, in a low voice. " I must
obliterate the anchor from my creed, but,
Adela, I have loved you well and truly ;
now the vision is over. Think of me still
as Lilian's father and your firm friend,
who ought to have had more wisdom than
to have put your affection to such a test."

For a moment he stood before his wife's
picture, then passed on to the door and
opened it, and Adela had no choice but to
follow him.

I like this monument better than the
one in the church," she said, as he walked
by her side down the broad staircase,
although that is very beautiful, with its
lovely tracery of lilies, and the most
perfect of them broken ofi", with its
fallen blossoms, so touch ingiy emblematic
of your lily, taken in her prime. But the
sculpture of her is most exquisite. Was it
really done after she had passed away ? "

*' Eeally. Miss D  , the most famous
lady sculptor of our day, did it for me."

And was she in that very costume ? "

Yes ! She expressed a wish many
times to be buried in her wedding-dress."

How she must have loved you ! " said
Adela tenderly.

"You are right, my dear. She had no
thought but for her poor old Dick," he
replied, with a smile and a softened lookin
eyes and mouth. 'rand now you will
be glad to get rid of me. I have detained
you too long already."

"Do not speak so to me. Sir Eichard,"
pleaded the girl. " I am most grateful to
you for letting me see your treasures, and
for all your affection too, believe me ! "

'every well child, I'll try to believe
you."

"And to think that all is for the best.
I should blame myself if you were not
happy."

6i

Do not do that, my dear ; I am used
to life's shadows. And now get to your
writing, and turn out a good brisk article."

She closed the MS.

Not to-day," she answered, " I could
not write a line ! "

LADY LYNESTONE GOES INTO SOCIETY.

Lady LYNESTONE's days of
mourning were things of the
past. She still thought kindly,
and with regret, of the good old man who
had taken her from a life of poverty and
drudgery,  thought of him as one at peace,
whom it would be wrong to wish back in
this world of cares and troubles, which
needs must come to the best as well as
to the worst of men ; to the richest as
well as to the poorest.

She had been a model young widow,

but now her friends ursed her to come
more freely into society, and to take up
that place in the world to which she had
the right ; if not for her own sake, for that
of her boy, for whose benefit she should
make acquaintances among influential
people of her own class.

Had any one told the little Countess that
she was getting weary of retirement and
solitude she would have denied it indignantly
; but, nevertheless, when she had
decided to come out of her chrysalis state,
she was as eager and excited over it all, as
any young girl looking forward to her first
ball.

Rosamond, Countess of Limestone, did
not lack a single advantage in her introduction
to the great world. She was taken
up by the very best people. The Duchess
of St Ives, whose blood was of the bluest,
and whose character was sans reproche,
presented her at Court, and offered her a

place under her aristocratic wing, introducing
her to all those whom she deemed
worth knowing.

Her own rank gave her status, and her
youth and beauty made her a star of the
London season ; while her money was an
additional attraction to men " about to
marry," or to those who contemplated
matrimony as a destination of necessity to
be arrived at some day, looking at it as
they did from their various standpoints.
To some it was a needful evil ; to others
an inevitable fate, which overtakes men
sooner or later, so that they think they
may as well be on the look-out to accept
it under circumstances as favourable as
possible  to a few, as the crowning point
of earthly happiness, but to only a very
few.

The Countess of Limestone, with her
handsome town house, stylish carriages, and
liveried servants ; the beautiful Countess

in the dainty and elegant dresses which
AVorth turned out for her, regardless of
expense, had plenty of admirers, both eligible
and ineligible.

An Italian nobleman followed her about
like her own shadow, until he became a
positive annoyance to her.

It was at a ball at the Duchess of St
Ives' that she had first met him, and she
was often rallied by her friends as to his
evident adoration.

But Rosamond had taken a strange dislike
to the man, with his compliments, his
sweet, soft nothings, and the perpetual
worship of his dark eyes.

It might have pleased a school-girl, but
not Lady Limestone, who had experienced
the stern realities of life as well as its
frivolities.

"You have made an undoubted impression,
my dear ! " laughed the Duchess.

I cannot say the same for the gentle-vol.

III. E

man, unless it be a had one, dear Duchess ;
and now I want you to tell me who the
creature really is."

Her Grace shrugged her shoulders.

Ciel ! my child, how should I tell you ?
The Marchese di Elvira is a Woman of
Romans, according to his own account.
His title is a known one ; for the rest, he
is received everywhere, and that is all
which we require to know."

'' I don't like him."

Tant pis pour luV

I wish he would not follow me about."

'* No doubt he is of a persevering nature."

Then it is a pity he does not employ
it better."

*' He is a good-looking fellow, Eosamond.
Why do you so dislike him ? "

I cannot say. My instincts are against
him."

Very odd ! I wonder how you will
like our new guest."

Who is that ? "

Lord Carruthers ; you don't know him,
do you ? " as she looked up at his name.

No ; but he was at Mentone when we
were, and some friends of mine have often
spoken of him."

Favourably ? "

Oh, yes ! they liked him very much."

"I am glad of that; he is a favourite
of mine, and will be a good match, if any
of the London girls can catch him ; but
the bird has the credit of being somewhat
shy in coming forward."

** All the better ; there are too many
male coquettes by half"

Not more than female, my dear ! I
never allow abuse of either sex ; one is as
good and as bad as the other."

Very likely. Duchess ; but there is nothing
good in the Marchese."

You are hard-hearted, Eosamond ! I
think the man is harmless."

"Do you? I don't!"

That is unfortunate, as you will both be
guests in our house. Had I really thought
you disliked him so much, I would not
have invited him."

Oh ! he cannot hurt me," answered
Eosamond, and a dark man within the
door of the conservatory, who had been
hidden from the ladies by the thick green
foliage, now stepped into the room, and
stood with eyes fixed upon Lady Lyne stone,
with a strange expression in them, which
was almost mockery.

She rose at once.

Duchess, it is time to dress," she said
quietly. " Will you excuse me ? "

No, Eosamond, I will not excuse you,"
laughed the lady, " for I'll] follow you 1
Marchese, you know your way about % " and
she gave her hand a comprehensive wave, to
indicate that the whole establishment was
at his service, upon which the man bowed

low, as a Roman nobleman would, and
should do.

"How can you be so civil to him ? '*
asked the Countess, as soon as the door
was closed behind them.

One must be all that to one's guests,
Kosie. You're not amiable this afternoon,
or you would recognise the fact at once ;
and, moreover, I'm sure the man heard our
remarks. Did you see him look at you ?
My dear, you had better not make an
enemy of him ; these hot-blooded foreigners
are sometimes rather dangerous people to
offend."

*' I'd sooner have him for an enemy thana
friend ! "

'' I don't know, Rosie. Put on that exquisite
silver grey dress, with its vapour-like
tulle trimmings ; it looks like cloudlets
upon a soft calm sky, with the gloaming
coming on, and the diamonds which
you wear to clasp it, seem like the first

pale stars peeping out. You will never
look so sweet as you do in your half mourning
shades : no one ever does ! "

"Your simile is quite poetic, Duchess,
but I believe Worth knows how to blend
all colours."

They stood laughing at the door of
Lady Limestone's bedroom, and then she
went in and found her maid waiting for
her, and the Duchess of St Ives passed
on.

The Marchese looked after the ladies, and
an evil expression crossed his face.

It matters little, mia cava uccellina,
whether you like me or no," he muttered.
Money I must have, and with the story
I shall tell you, you will do as I wish, for
the sake of your blue-eyed boy. I have
no fears, oh ! dear no. You would not risk
seeing him turned from Limestone as an
impostor," and the evil look deepened ashe
smiled.

He was no longer a very young man.
Forty-five summers and winters liacl probably
passed over his head, but they had
not whitened a hair ; still there were lines
about his face when in repose, which proclaimed
him all his age.

He was already in evening dress, and,
finding himself alone, he lounged luxuriously
in an easy - chair, making himself
very much at home.

A large party assembled at dinner, and
Lady Limestone found herself paired off
with the new guest, Lord Carruthers. He
recognised her again at once, for her beauty
had made a great impression upon him
when he had seen her nt the florist's in
Mentone.

As for her, she had a vague idea that
she had met him somewhere before,
although she had not been introduced to
him.

They were evidently mutually pleased

with one another, and chatted with ease
together, while the Marchese watched
them with lowering brow.

I must strike soon," he muttered, ashe
tossed off his champagne freely.

I think I know some friends of yours,
Lord Carruthers," said the Countess, with
a smile.

Indeed ! " responded the Earl.

Yes ! Sir Richard Freemantle and his
daughter were very kind to me in my
early widowhood, and Miss Thorndyke  "

A slight shadow fell across his face
at the name of the girl he had loved so
long and so well, and Lady Limestone
noticed it.

Do you not like them ? " she asked
innocently.

Like them ? yes, most sincerely. I
am glad they are your friends."

I was wondering if by any possibility
I could have seen you with them. Lord

Oarruthers ! Somehow your face seems
familiar to me, and yet  "

Yes, we met once," he returned, in a
low voice. " It was at Mentone, and you
were purchasing flowers. I have never
forgotten you. Lady Limestone ; you were
looking so sad."

*' I was in trouble," she returned, as she
drooped her eyes, "but, strange to say, I
remember you."

Do you ? " he asked eagerly. " I am
so glad of that ! " and there was a short
silence between them.

"Have you heard of Miss Thorndyke's
trouble ? " she said at length.

'' No. I have only just returned from
a trip to Australia. I have been wandering;
about the face of the earth of
late."

And I have often longed to do so,"
she replied ; " but we women have so little
latitude allowed us. I should not have

cared to go, followed by a troop of servants.
I wanted to be alone."

** I understand : that feeling will come
to us sometimes. But about Miss Thorn -
dyke ? "

She has lost her father, poor girl."

It will be a sad blow to her," he returned
gravely, " and I am sorry for Mrs
Thorndyke's sake also. They were a very
united family. Poor fellow ! So he is
gone ! I certainly did not expect to hear
that."

Nor any one else till quite lately. He
had been ailing; a long time, but no one
thought anything very serious was the
matter with him. What a favourite he
was ! The worst of it is that they are left
badly off, and of course they will have to
leave the Rectory. I mean to ask them
down to Limestone to stay as long as they
like. I do not know the mother, but I
intend to be fond of her for Adela s sake."

He gave her a grateful glance.

You like her ? " she said interrogatively.

'' Yes ; we are real friends."

So are she and I."

Our mutual liking for her will be a
bond of union between us," he said softly.
- Shall it be ? "

She lifted her face to his, and their eyes-met.


'' I think ive shall be friends, too, some
day," she answered gently.

"At no distant one, I hope," he replied,
in an eager tone.

Then, looking up, he met the sinister
glance of the Italian fixed upon them.

Who is that dark fellow ? " he inquired.

My Mte noire'' she laughed. " Da
you know, I have an idea that that man
will yet give me trouble or annoyance."


Indeed I hope not, Lady Limestone ;
but if ever that day should arrive, remember

that you have a friend in Reginald
Carruthers."

I will not forget," she answered gratefully.
*' You see I have no old friends.
My husband and I lived so quiet a life,
and my only relation now is Lord Lyne-stone's
nephew, my boy's guardian. I suppose
you do not chance to know Major
Egerton  I beg his pardon, I heard of his
promotion to-day. He is now the colonel
of his regiment, and appointed to the
second battalion, at present stationed at
Malta ; so I hope we shall see more of him
than it has been possible for us to do
hitherto, for he has been in India. He
came to us at Mentone at Lord Lyne-stone's
request, when he was so ill. I don't
know what I should have done without
him. He saw me through all my troubles
before he went back."

He was a brother officer and especial
chum of poor Thorndyke's. I have never

seen him, but I have heard him spoken
of often at the Eectory, and always with
affection."

"Yes, I am sure he is a good fellow,"
continued the Countess warmly. "You
know he was my husband's heir for so
many years, and every one thought him
a confirmed old bachelor. It must have
been a bitter disappointment to Colonel
Egerton when Lord Limestone married
me, but he showed me no ill-feeling or
resentment, as some men would have
done."

They would not have deserved the
name of men," replied the Earl.

I don't know. I have always felt very
sorry for the Colonel."

"He is happy in having your sympathy,"
returned Lord Carruthers kindly.

"Are you going to Lady Molyneux's
ball to-night ? " she asked suddenly.

I suppose so. I am at the Duchess

of St Ives' service to go where she
directs."

How very obliging ! " laughed Rosamond.
" You have no will of your own,
then ? "

I don't know. Are you going ? "

Yes ! decidedly."

Then I have a will ; I'm going too ! "

The Countess caught the glance of her
hostess's eye, and the ladies thereupon
retired to the drawing-room.

My dear." said the Duchess kindly,
"I am glad to see you getting on so
swimmingly with Lord Carruthers. He
is quite one of the right sort  no affectation,
no nonsense. He is neither a fop
nor a fool, nor a woman-hater, nor a
master. If my daughter were seventeen
instead of seven, I should often invite
him to meet her."

"That is very complimentary to his
lordship," laughed Rosamond ; " but I

am sure you are right. There is something
very honest and genuine about
him ! "

That is open ! Well, how many
dances are you engaged to him for
this evening ? "

None at present."

Oh ! He does not make hay while
the sun shines."

'' We did not mention the ball till
the last minute."

I see ; well, I will take care that
he is in your carriage, and escorts
you."

Thanks ! any one but the Marchese."

My dear, I don't think that renowned
foreigner appreciated your easy
chat with Carruthers," laughed the
Duchess ; "I saw strange sparks flash
from his dark eyes."

"I do not see that it can matter to
him to whom I talk. He ought to

know by now that any one's company
is preferable to me than his."

The Duchess shrugged her ivory shoulders.

"There is no accounting for men.
Some require no encouragement ; in
fact, the more they are repulsed the
more determined they are in their suit.
The Marchese means to have you, Rosamond.


The little Countess gave her such a
startled look, that her friend laughed
heartily.

These are not the days of masked
ruffians and abductions, Kosie. Don't
be scared. The Marchese dare not run
off with you against your weill, but he
will try and bend your will to his."

-How?"

How can I tell ? I wish I had
never invited him here ; but on this
particular occasion it was St Ives' fault,
not mine. He asked him, or let him

ask himself ; from what \ can make
out that is nearer the mark. And now
wall you think me rude if I leave you
tomorrow morning for two or three
hours ? I must go and see my parents
upon some business."

Not in the least. Send the gentlemen
out, and especially the Marchese,
and I shall be perfectly happy with my
boy. You won't mind his coming down,
and keeping me company ? "

"Far from it. I want you to feel
perfectly at home."

"Talking of home, I might as well
give up my town house, and shut up
my country one, for all I see of either
of them," laughed Lady Limestone. " But
I really am going home shortly, and shall
hope to see you at dear old Limestone ! "

I'll come with pleasure. Shall I
bring the Marchese with me ? " she
added, lauohino;.

VOL. III. F

"Pray, pray don't !"

Well, we shall have to be off soon ;
the gentlemen are coming."

The Duchess led her husband aside
and gave him instructions as to how
the party was to be divided, and Lady
Limestone found herself opposite Lord
Carruthers, with her host and hostess
as her companions.

I thought we four would keep
together," said the latter kindly, " for
our little Countess here is afraid of
a pair of admiring dark eyes."

"What! of the Marchese ? " replied
the Duke. " Well, he has a fierce look
sometimes, I must confess."

*'lt is very strange," said Lord Carruthers
thoughtfully ; " but I am certain
that man and I have met before, and I
believe he has the same feeling concerning
me ; and, moreover, he has not left
a favourable impression upon my memory."

I hope he is all right," replied St
Ives. " I met him first at the Duke of
Edinburgh's. The man sings divinely,
and upon that occasion carried all his
hearers with him."

Does he ? " answered the other
eagerly. " Well, I'll keep my eye upon
him, but I'm almost sure now he is nota
stranger to me. However, I "nay be
wrong, I was a very young man at the
time  a lad in fact  travelling with my
tutor. It is some years since, still his
is a peculiar face."

A handsome one, decidedly."
Yes, of the Fra Diavolo type."
Then turning to the ladies he engaged
them both for a couple of round dances,
just as the carriage drew up at Lady
Molyneux's house : and he helped Lady
Limestone across the crimson carpet at
the entrance, past the watchers who
usually congregate to see the ladies' costumes,

amidst the ferns and flowers
into the spacious hall.

Already there before them was the
Marchese di Elvira.

Lady Limestone started as she saw
him, for she knew he had been left behind
when they drove ofi'.

"You have come by electricity, Marchese,"
said the Duchess of St Ives.

I never waste time, Duchess," he
replied, with a bow ; " my countrymen
do not let the grass grow under their
feet, I can assure you ! "

** No ? I thought you were all ease-loving
people ! "

"We earn our ease before we enjoy
it!"

Lady Molyneux here came forward,
and gave her friends a hearty welcome ;
and in a few moments Lady Limestone
was gliding evenly round the ballroom,
held by the firm clasp of Lord Carruthers,

thoroughly enjoying the good
dancing of her partner, while the Marchese
stood stroking his dark moustache,
evidently in a thoughtful mood.

Confound the fellow 1" he said at
last, half aloud. '' I wish to Heaven I
could tell if he remembers me. As for
myself, I never forget a face."

He stepped forward and asked Lady
Limestone for a dance, but could only
obtain the promise of a square one,
much to his annoyance.

It is scarcely possible to hold consecutive
conversation in the mazes of the
Lancers, and he did not attempt it.

The heat, the dresses, the Academy,
the floral decorations, and a few compliments,
carried them to the end, and then
he offered her his arm.

She made some hasty excuse to join
her friend, and cleverly avoided a tete-tete
with him all the evening.

I can wait," he murmured, in a low
voice, while his dark eyes followed her
every movement.

It would have been a pleasant ball to
the little Countess, save for those eyes ;
but it was over at last, and the party
of four returned home as they went.

As the carriage drew up at the Duke's
mansion, Lord Carruthers noticed a
woman with a strange, weird, but still
beautiful face, lingering near the entrance,
and as the queen of night shone upon
it, there was something familiar in it ;
and a fancy seized him to watch her
movements, although he could scarcely
tell why. And having bade his friends
good-night, he asked the butler to let
him out by some other door, begging
him to admit him again the same way
upon his return, as he was going for a
stroll while he smoked his weed.

A VILE PLOT.

[HE following morning the Duchess
was up unusually early for her,
and she went to Lady Lyne-stone's
bedroom to say good-bye.

Before starting, she had laughingly
begged Lord Carruthers to take care of
the young widow, and not to let the
Marchese scare her with his admiration.

A peculiar smile crossed his Lordship's
face.

'' If needs be, I think I can silence him,"
he answered, somewhat vaguely.

Indeed ! How ? "

"At present with a name only. Later
I hope to do so with something more
substantial and satisfactory."

"You know something against him
then ? "

'* I do."

"Then, Lord Carruthers, he should not
be a guest in our house. You must confide
your secret to the Duke."

I fully intend to do so, but not
before I can prove what I state. When
shall you be back, Duchess ? I shall not
leave the house till you return."

About three, or, stay, I will come
back to luncheon at two if I find it
possible. Li the meantime, au revoir.
I leave you ' on guard.' Don't let anyone
run away with my little Countess,"
and with a friendly nod she walked towards
the door.

Are you ofi" now ? Then let me see

you to your carriage," and he followed
her out into the hall.

Lord Carruthers was pale, and there
were unusual lines of thought upon his
brow.

He had had a wakeful night, and what
little sleep he had obtained was fitful and
restless.

When he went out the night before to
watch the woman he had seen loitering
about at the door of the Duke's mansion,
he had scarcely got outside the house
when a hansom dashed up, and the
Marchese sprang to the ground, and,
having paid the fare, was raising his
hand to the mediaeval bell - pull when
a detaining one was laid upon his
arm.

Carlo ! for the love of Heaven, stop ! "
pleaded a woman's voice, in a pretty,
broken accent. *' I ivill not lead the life
of a dog, while you follow one of enjoyment

and luxury. You will find that
even a worm will turn if you torture it
too far."

What ! another scene, Marie ! What
things you women are ! " he cried impatiently.
" Am I not working for your
good as well as my own ? "

My good ! " she laughed bitterly ;
*' you have always thought of that ! My
good, that you should make love to another
woman ! "

Bah ! jealous ! If you play the
part I have set you properly, you will
never lack money or fine dresses again.
You must swear to every word of my
story, my little sister ! "

Your sister ! " she retorted scornfully.
Carlo, if I loved you as once I did,
before you had killed my devotion, you
would scarcely have dared to thus ask
me to help you to marry another woman ;
but as it is  "

She broke off suddenly with a pathetic
wail in her voice.

'ras it is  " he repeated coldly.

"Our Lady help me, I hate you!"

"All the better," he returned, with a
cruel smile. " I shall pay you well for
your services, and the account between us
will be settled."

She covered her wan face with her hands,
then suddenly let them drop with a gesture
of despair, and looked at him.

And once I loved you passionately,
Carlo. Do you remember, many years
ago, when disgrace fell upon you, who it
was that shielded you ? I was pure as a
summer morning then, Heaven knows, but
I gave up my reputation to save your life.
You could not have been the man who-robbed
and murdered the young French
nobleman ; of course not, when you had
passed the night with Marie Paravisso.
She loved you with an insane worship of

you, and your Heaven-born art. You
knew it, and asked this sacrifice of her
love, promising to repay it with a life of
devotion. She swore to it in the court,
with cheeks tingling with shame, and
blushes which but confirmed her story.
Some men would have died willingly
rather than expose a guilty mistress.
But there are few Who would have
bought freedom at the price of an innocent
woman's honour. Her father was a Woman,
and could not brook disgrace. He cast
her ofi*, and died of a broken heart ! She
has much to thank you for, Carlo
Cavenci ! "

Hush ! " he said uneasily. *' Go home,
and I will call upon you tomorrow afternoon.
By then I shall know when you will
be wanted."

Home ! " she repeated. 'rit is mockery
to give it such a name."

"Mockery, or no mockery, you had

better go. I cannot waste any more time
talking to you."

She laughed a low, vindictive laugh.

You might find it no waste of time
to be civil, Carlo ; but as it is 
actio ! "

He turned and took her hand.

Don't speak like that, Marie. I mean
to behave handsomely to you when I
have the money to do so; you may trust
me. Good-night. Move away, care, before
I ring."

She obeyed him, and paused beneath
the very portico under the shadow of
which Lord Carruthers was standing
hidden.

'trust him!" she moaned. "It would
be as well to trust the restless and uncertain
sea. Why should I stain my soul
with a new lie for his sake? He can but
murder me if I refuse. And if he did ?
What has my life been that I should

preserve it ? Oh ! if I had but one
friend to whom I could turn ; only one
to advise me, and help me to a better
life, where his tyranny could not reach
me ! "

Lord Carruthers moved, and she started
like a timid deer, and was turning away,
when he spoke to her in a kind voice.

Do you avant a friend ? " he asked.

Who would be one to me in a strange
land ? " she answered wearily.

Perhaps I can help you ; who knows ? "

"You!"

*' Yes. I have heard all that passed
between you and that man ; and I was
in Italy when it all happened. So I
know what you said was true."

You are too young ; you cannot remember
it."

I was but a lad, but I was in court
when you gave that evidence which saved
-Carlo Cavenci's life."

A great trembling seized upon her, and
she clung to the postern for support.

"Poor girl!" he said gently. "I wish
I could ask you in to rest ; but this is
not my house, and I cannot. Come, take
my arm, and let me walk part of the way
home with you. What is your relationship,
really, to Cavenci?"

'' I am his wife ! "

** Can you prove that ? Have you the
certificate of your marriage ? " he asked
eagerly.

"No, but I can give you the names of
the priest who united us, and of the
church where we were wedded, if you
like."

He stopped under the light of a street
lamp, and entered both upon a tablet,
which he took from his pocket for that
purpose.

And now," he said kindly, " in gratitude
for the information you have given

mc, let me help you. Would you like to
have a quiet home with a good woman,
where that black-hearted villain can never
molest you ? "

She turned up to his a white, wondering
face, and he continued, 

When I was a boy, I had a governess
who was very fond of me, and my father
pensioned her for her lifetime. She lives
in a tiny cottage within my park gates.
She would receive you if I asked
her."

And you would ask her ? " she demanded,
in astonishment.

Yes ! Yours was a noble sacrifice, and
it has been ill rewarded. You spoke of
Cavenci requiring another lie of you. Will
you tell me what it is ? "

I will ! " she answered, after a pause.
*'Do you know what he is trying to do
now ? "

I believe I do. He is endeavouring

to get a young and rich widow into his
power."

That is it ; and he wants me to help
him."

How ? "

I am to state that I am his sister, and
that Lord Limestone married me privately
in Italy, but not being happy with him
I ran away, and let others tell him of
my death ; but that, being still alive,
the Countess had never had any claim
to the title of wife, nor right to the
property left to her for herself, or her
son."

But the certificates ! He could not
produce them ! "

Could he not ? Carlo can accomplish
anything upon which he has set his mind,
and all priests are not above being bribed ! "

What a vile plot ! " he cried passionately.
" Signora, you will not lend yourself
to it ? "

VOL. III. G

"If I cross him, do you know what
will happen ? "

"No."

*' Marie Cavenci will be seen and heard
of no more."

You will be perfectly safe with my
old governess."

Should I ? " she asked eagerly. " And

is this lady he is pursuing a friend of

?jj

A very great friend."

Then I will never say it, for your
sake, for you have spoken kindly to me.
He can but kill me ! "

'' Poor girl ! It is too late to find you
a place of refuge to-night, but early tomorrow
I will provide you a safe asylum,
and in a few days you shall go to a
permanent home. Give me your present
address, and pack up whatever you desire
to bring with you, but let it be only
what you can carry, and tell no one

at your lodging that you are going
away, for doubtless they are all the
creatures of Cavenci. Go out at eight
o'clock tomorrow morning, and at the
end of the street you will see a four-wheeler
cab. Follow it, and you will
find me in it. Do not keep me waiting,
as I must be back here at nine o'clock.
Cavenci must not miss me from the .
When he seeks you in the
afternoon he will find his bird flown.
Do you understand my plan ? "

Yes, and I am more than grateful
to you, Signore. No one knows
what I have suffered ; it is time it
ended."

Quite time ; and no other woman
shall fall a victim to him if I can help
it. And now farewell, I must return
to the house, as I am keeping the
servants up. At eight tomorrow, remember."


At eight, and Heaven and our Lady
bless you."

The butler was waiting for Lord Carruthers,
and admitted him at once, and
was well rewarded for his vigil.

Ls Maury up ? " inquired his lordship,
referring to his own valet.

Yes, my lord ; he is waiting for you."

Then send him to my room at once,"
and Lord Carruthers went upstairs with
rapid strides. He was elated at having
so easily discovered all he desired to
know.

"He said he would tell her tomorrow,"
he soliloquised; "he must have ascertained
that the Duchess is going out ;
but, never mind, I will be upon the
spot."

His man entered, and he desired him
to call him at seven o'clock punctually,
and to have a four-wheeler cab at the

door by a quarter-past, but to make no
comments upon his movements to the
servants in the house ; then he dismissed
him to bed, and was glad to be alone.

Poor Adela," he said, after a pause
of thoughtful reflection. " Poor girl ! I
would to Heaven I could help her in
her trouble. If only she had not told
me of her love for that other, T would
yet again have offered her the shelter of
my care. If she has got over it, her
heart might even now turn to me."

Then arose in his mind the question
whether he really loved her still %

The hope and passion had died out
of his heart little by little. Was what
remained really love ?

He was unable to answer the query
which he had raised. He had believed
himself to be not only true, but steadfast
in his attachment to Adela ; and,
now, between the memory of her face

and his, floated another image  that of
Rosamond, the young widowed Countess
of Limestone.

No, no ! I shall ever love Adelaide
asserted impatiently. *' I will see her
again, and she will be as dear to me as
ever ; and, yes, I will ask her once more
to be my wife ; " and, having so determined,
he seemed better satisfied with
himself.

But it was of Eosamond he dreamed in
his fitful, uncertain sleep.

Punctually at seven he was called, and
after making a hurried toilet, he hastened
downstairs as noiselessly as possible.
The cab was at the door, he jumped in.
On his way he stopped at a respectable-looking
house, though certainly not in a
fashionable neighbourhood, and getting
out, knocked at the door, which was
quickly opened by a neat looking elderly
woman.

'' Lor's a mercy, my lord ! only to think
of seeing you so early ! " she cried, in unfeigned
astonishment,

Yes, I am early, Mrs Rawlins ; I want
your help."

'' And that you shall have, my lord ;
there's nothing as you can ask, to which
I'd say no, having served the late dear
lord for thirty years, and owing the roof
over my head to his generosity"

I felt sure you would assist me," he
said, with a kindly smile. " Have you
two nice rooms vacant ? "

And that I have  the first floor."
"Then I'll engage them at once, and I
want the tenant to come in within an
hour."

Dearie me ! Well, everything is clean
and tidy, so I've no call to raise objections."


"The lady who I shall bring here is
very little known to me, but she is in great

trouble, and I want you to be kind to
lier."

Lor, sir ! you're always a helping
some one ; and that T will, with pleasure
! "

And don't talk about her to your
friends and neighbours, if she seems at
all strange."

She ain't  " and Mrs Rawlins touched
her head suggestively.

*' Not a bit, only in deep sorrow ; and
now I'm off. I will drive her here myself,"
and his lordship went briskly down the
steps.

''He's a Carruthers," murmured the old
woman contentedly. " I need have no
fear ; they're good, every one of them, and
if she was not all right, he would not
bring her here ; but I wouldn't have received
a tenant at such short notice from
any one else," and Mrs Rawlins, having
dusted the rooms, laid the breakfast things

and put the kettle on to boil, and tidied
herself to receive the new arrival.

Signora Cavenci was waiting in the
street when the cab drew up at the end
of it, and hurried to the vehicle.

"No one is down yet," she whispered,
as though fearful of being heard. " I have
only brought this," placing a small leather
bag upon the seat opposite. ''He bought
what few things I have, so I thought I had
better leave them."

Quite right. Miss Wheeler will see
that you have all you need."

Is that the name of your old
governess ? "

** Yes ; and now I am going to take
you for the present to our old cook, Mrs
Rawlins ; Mrs by courtesy," he laughed.

May I know the name of my friend ? "
she asked, looking up at him.

Carruthers," he returned, " and, Signora,
I will be a friend to you."

She clasped his hand gratefully, and
after a moment's hesitation pressed her
lips to it. And he left her in Mrs Rawlins'
charge ; and desiring that everything should
be provided for her comfort, he promised
to see her again ere long, and drove away
as fast as the horse could carry him,
arriving at the Duke's mansion in Park
Lane before nine.

He rushed upstairs to his room, and
hastily refreshing himself with the cold
bath he found prepared for him, arrayed
himself in the clean linen and clothes
which his valet had placed ready to his
hand, and was downstairs in the 
within a few minutes of the
gong sounding.

The Marchese was already in the room,
and Lord Carruthers received his matutinal
greeting with a cold bow, which was noted
both by host and hostess.

Later, he had had the short conversation

before mentioned with her Grace, when
she came down ready for her start.

Then he wrote a note to Lady Lyne-stone,
sealed it, gave it to the butler, and
desired him to let her maid deliver it at
once to her ladyship.

She received it with wonder, at first
fearing it was from the Marchese, but her
face relaxed into a smile as she turned to
the signature. It was marked private
and ran thus : 

Dear Lady Limestone,  The
Marchese is in my power, do not fear
him. It is better that he should expose
his own villainy. Come down into
the drawing-room as though you suspect
nothing, he will soon join you. Remember,
I shall be behind the screen
and shall hear all he says, and be ready
to protect you. Give him rope, and
let him hang himself, and his persecution

will be a thing of the past.  Yours
sincerely, Carruthers."

She read it a second time attentively,
and smiled ; then, dressing herself in her
prettiest costume, descended to the
drawing-room.

ON Guard.

Lady LYNESTONE ensconced
herself in a low easy-chair,
and drew from a pretty work-basket
some dainty embroidery, and
began to stitch leisurely, without once
turning her face to the magnificent
oriental screen at the further corner of
the spacious apartment ; but, nevertheless,
her thoughts, if not her eyes, were centred
upon the person it was hiding from her
view.

How good he was to her ! and if only

he could really rid her of the presence of
the absolutely hated Marchese, how glad
she would be !

Not for the world would she thus risk
meeting him, but for Lord Carruthers'
written words. As it was, she was more
than willing to trust herself to his
guidance, and follow his advice. She
had not long to wait.

The Italian came through the conservatory,
singing an operatic air, in his
rarely beautiful voice. Greatly as she
disliked him, she paused to listen, her
senses stirred by his wonderful power.
He stood in the doorway, and saw
the softened look upon her face, and
smiled.

** My music pleases you, Contessa," he
said, in a low voice, and walking to the
piano he poured out what appeared to
be his soul, in a passionate love-song,
then suddenly he was at her side.

Contessa ! " he said softly, '' I sing
for you ; all I have sung is for you ; no
words, no melody, are too sweet to tell
you how I love you ! You need no telling,
every woman knows when she is
beloved ; but it is my pride and my
pleasure to pour out my heart before you
as water* Contessa, give me the joy of
knowing that love has begotten love ! "
and he bent over, and looked into her
eyes.

An indignant flush mounted to her
cheek.

Marchese," she said gravely, " I
have given you no encouragement to
address me thus ; and more, I decline to
listen to such words from you. You
could never gain my affection, so it is
useless for you to try."

'' Nay, sweet one, do not give a hasty
judgment ; you may see that it is
better to have a friend and husband

and protector, than to meet trouble
alone."

Trouble of course comes to all, but
my good lord has shielded me from most
cares by his kind thoughtfulness forme."


Your good Lord ! " he echoed ironically.
" Did you really believe in him,
Contessa ? "

Did I believe in him ? " she repeated,
looking him fully in the face, " most
truly and firmly ! "

Covering ! " he said softly.

"I do not require your pity, Marches
di Riviera," she answered proudly.

Poor child ! You do not know."

Know what ? If you have anything
to say, say it."

As you will," he replied, with a shrug
of his shoulders, and drawing a chair to
her side, he seated himself, and looked
earnestly in her face.

"Did you believe Lord Limestone to he
a bachelor when you married him,
Contessa ? "

A bachelor ! Of course he was ; a
confirmed old bachelor. No one ever
expected him to take a wife to
dear old Limestone," she said, with a
smile.

"Yet he might have taken one there,
had he chosen, some years before he took
you to share his home, poor girl," he
answered compassionately.

What do you mean ? "

Contessa, how can I bear to pain you,
I who love you," he answered, with a
foreign gesture.

"Pray do not spare my feelings."

If I might if I dared."

I beg you will proceed."

"You do not know what you are
asking, Contessa ; Lord Limestone had
married before."

VOL. III. H

Do you mean to tell me that my
husband was a widower ? "

'alas! no. His wife, or rather widow,
still lives."

Of course she does ; I am not afraid
of my own shadow, Marchese," she
laughed.

Poor child ! you laugh ! Yet you
never were his wife ; my otvn sister tuas
Lady Limestone, and she is yet alive."

Your sister ! Oh ! there must be some
grand mistake."

"Not so ; he married her in Some, and
she is now in town to claim her name and
property, if I ivill let her. You and your
boy are nameless and penniless, covering I
Now do you think I love you, Rosamond,
or no ? "

If this were all true I should acknowledge
the fact of your affection, however
ill-placed it might be," she answered
gravely.

My darling ! " he continued, taking
her unwilling hand ; " my sister shall
never breathe this sad secret, never throw
a shadow over your fair name, nor ruin
the future of your bright eyed boy. Give
me the right to protect you, and I will do
so with my life."

"My hand is, then, the price of your
silence ? "

"It is."

Marchese," she said, rising and
drawing herself up proudly, " if the title
and property are your sister's, nothing
would induce me to do her the great
wrong of retaining them. Neither my
fair fame, nor my boy's future, could
tempt me to commit so gross an act of
injustice. Let your sister prove her right,
and I well give up my claims without a
murmur."

Brave woman ! " whispered Lord
Oarruthers, in his hiding-place.

"And you care nothing what the world
will say of you ? "

Nothing ! "

Rosamond, you shall not thus sacrifice
yourself. I will protect you in spite of
your wishes," and he flung his arm about
her.

Don't touch me, sir," she cried indignantly.
" Am I to be insulted in her
Grace's drawing-room '? "

No," answered a voice.

The Marchese di Riviera, or Carlo
Cavenci, started, and in another moment
he and Lord Carruthers stood face to
face.

Coward and liar ! " cried his lordship,
with flashing eyes.

Such words to a Roman nobleman ! "
blustered the Italian. " Your lordship
shall answer for each one."

I will, with a horsewhip ! " returned
the other coldly, " if you are not out of

this house, bag and baggage, in a quarter
of an hour."

"Are you its master?"

I am yours, Carlo Cavenci. I was in
court when you were tried for robbery and
murder, and when you bought your
wretched life at the expense of a woman's
honour. Maria Paravisso's was a noble
sacrifice, and you have generously repaid
it. Go, and never let me see your face
again, or you may regret the day you
crossed my path. The whole vile tale
you have woven to bend the Countess to
your will, is a tissue of lies. You have no
sister, but you have a ivife, whom you
have left to pine in a low lodging-house,
among coarse and brutal people, unfit to
come near a refined woman. If you take
my advice, you will leave England before
worse comes of it."

He crossed the room and rang the
bell.

Call a cab for this person," he said,
indicating the Italian to the butler, " and
let him have what assistance you can to
get him away as soon as possible."

The well-trained servant let no surprise
appear in his face. He bowed, and held
the door open for Carlo Cavenci to pass
out.

The man stood like a stag at bay. He
knew that the game was up. For one
moment he let his eyes rest with a bitter
hatred upon that other who had defeated
all his plans.

"AVe may meet again," he muttered
through his clenched teeth, and turned
from the room without another word.

He will trouble you no more, Lady
Limestone," said Lord Carruthers kindly ;
but I fear, as it is, he has seared you,
notwithstanding my warning," and he took
her hand and led her to a seat.

*' Oh, Lord Carruthers, what a dreadful

creature ! I am afraid of him, and that's
a fact. What did he mean by saying such
awful things ? "

'' His words meant that he is both a
ruffian and an impostor. He wished to
frighten you into marrying him, by this
bogie of his own wicked invention, for
there is not a word of truth in anything
that he has said. The story of Lord Lyne-stone's
former union is as false as his pretended
love for you. Bah ! the word is
not fit to come from his lying lips. I am
thankful I came here, and that I have
been able to unmask him, for had I not
done so he might have given you real
trouble. If he had told you this cruel tale,
and you had believed him, and consented
to keep it a secret, goodness knows where
the evil would have stopped. He would
have had you in his power."

The Countess shivered.

I hope I should have had the strength

of mind to tell him to do his worst ; but
who can tell ? " she added, in a low
voice.

Then she lifted her eyes to his, and
stretched out her hand to him.

You have been a real friend to me,
Lord Carruthers. I shall ever be grateful
for your kindness, and I hope we shall
know more of each other."

"I sincerely reciprocate your sentiment,"
he answered, as he pressed her hand
affectionately ; " and if ever I'm in the
vicinity of Limestone I shall claim the
privilege of a friend, and call upon you."

Will you come to Limestone and stay?"
she inquired warmly. " The Duchess has
promised to pay me a visit shortly, and if
you will accompany her I shall be more
than glad."

Do you mean it ? " he asked, after a
thoughtful pause.

Yes, indeed ; a hearty welcome will

await you, if you do not object to the illness
of the dear old place. But I can offer you
good shooting, and fishing, and hunting too,
if you are fond of the sport."

*' Then I will come," he said decidedly,
if her Grace will accept me as an escort.
But mind," he added, with a smile, "it is
neither the shooting, fishing, nor hunting
which has tempted me, but the desire to
improve a friendship so pleasantly begun."
Eeally ? "
'' And truly."

Then silence fell between them, and she
took up her fancy work, that woman's
refuge upon all awkward occasions. She
was the first to speak.

How surprised our host and hostess
will be to find their guest gone ! " she said,
with a smile.

And glad too, I am sure."
I am certain of that ; they never liked
him."

And yet they invited him to their
bouse ! Society, Society ! "

Yes, Society is very hollow ; people
never pause to judge for themselves what
men or women are. ' They are received
everywhere,' is answer enough, however
bad they may be."

In fact it is a case of one fool makes
many."

That is it ; I have enjoyed my peep
at the bright world, but I should not care
to live in it ; there is too much glare and
glitter, and too little sincerity and reality.
I am happier in quiet, grand old Limestone.
The trees suit me better than the lamp-posts
; the curtseys of my poor tenants
than the bows of the " upper ten ; " and
the deer in the park than the brilliant
carriages in the "Now." You see I was
not born to it, Lord Carruthers, and it is
all new to a girl in the middle class of life.
My father was an officer, it is true, but he

was a poor man ; and, moreover, he and
my mother were not happy together, and
they parted ; so I really never saw him.
They were both too proud ever to seek a
reunion. Of course each thought the other
to blame. It always is so in domestic
troubles, I suppose."

And always will be ; but it was sad for
you."

Yes. We had rather a bad time of it.
My mother's family were rich, but they
lost all their money, and during my girlhood
we were very poor ; in fact, my dear
mother really worked herself to death.
My father was Lord Limestone's private
secretary for many years, and when he
died he begged his lordship to seek us out,
and befriend us. You know now how he
came to marry me," she ended, with a
smile, and a bright upward glance.

I am certain of one thing," he answered
earnestly.

'rand that is  "

'that he never regretted it," and once
again silence reigned.

I hope I am not in your way," he said
at length, "but I promised the Duchess
to remain 'on guard' until her return."

"On the other hand, I fear I am wasting
your valuable time," she returned,
but I appreciate being looked after, I
can assure you."

Then I will remain without hesitation,
the more pleased to have your companionship,
knowing that duty calls me away
this afternoon."

"So soon?" she asked, with an evident
look of disappointment.

Yes ; we must not always consider our
own pleasure, you know, and we shall
meet again at Limestone."

I am very glad," she said ; then suddenly
looking up she asked if he minded
children.

'* No, I am very fond of them," he answered
truthfully.

Perhaps you won't object to my boy's
company too," she laughed; "for I promised
to have him down to sit with me,
and I never like to break my word to him."

Quite right," said his lordship, rising.
*may I ring the bell for you to order
him to be brought downstairs ? "

"Will you? Thank you very much."

So when the Duchess returned at a
quarter to two, she looked in upon a very
pretty picture.

The little fellow was seated comfortably
upon Lord Carruthers' knee, holding his
hand confidingly, and his blue eyes upturned
to his kindly face, listening to
some wonderful fairy tale which he was
inventing or repeating for his amusement,
while the young Countess paused in her
Avork to listen too, scarcely less interested
than the child.

A pretty picture of home life ! " cried
the Duchess. Fact had spoiled fiction.

The thread of the story was broken ;
they all three had to return from fairyland
to everyday life.

Lady Limestone sighed.

Is that all ? " asked the boy.

Not quite, I must kiss you," said his
lordship, stooping over him.

Yes ! for his pretty mother," thought
the woman of the world, with a smile
deepening about her lips.

Well, Lord Carruthers, you have been
faithful to your trust ? " she laughed.

He has, indeed," said the Countess
earnestly, putting away her work. '' Oh !
my dear friend, I can't think what I should
have done without him ; he has been so
good to me ! "

"I am glad you have earned such a
character," said her Grace, turning to Lord
Carruthers.

You can't think how that wretched
Marchese insulted me, and tried to frighten
me into marrying him, and goodness knows
what might have happened, but for Lord
Carruthers 1 "

'most gallant champion of dames, relate
your deeds ! " said her Grace tragically.


There is very little to relate," returned
his lordship, with a smile. " I
accidentally found out that the man was
laying a plot to entrap Lady Limestone,
and determined to unmask him  that is
all ! "

And well he succeeded ! " struck in
Lady Limestone warmly. " My dear,
he is not a marquis at all ; his name is
Carlo Cavenci, nothing more."

He was a singer in Naples when I
was a lad, and when I visited the city
with my tutor he was under a very black
cloud. He was tried for robbing and

murdering a French nobleman, to whose
rooms he went to play cards."

And he was acquitted ? "

He falsely proved an alibi'' returned
his lordship gravely.

And this creature has been an intimate
o;uest in our house ! " cried her
Grace indignantly. " The Duke really
must be more careful in inquiring about
people's antecedents. It does not do to
take even a proud Roman marquis upon
trust, you see. Lord Carruthers, I am
more than indebted to you for your care
of the Countess. What has become of
that monster ? "

He has gone," returned his lordship
quietly.

But he may return," she answered,
with . a look of alarm.

Not he.  I will make St Ives au
courant with all the facts of the case
after luncheon. One word will be enough

to send him off, if ever he should again
venture into your society, but my opinion
is that he will leave England before the
day is out."

Poor Eosamond ! Fancy such a
wretch trying to gain your love ! " said
her Grace indignantly. 'rit is atrocious
! "

More especially as his wife is now
in London," continued his lordship
dryly.

Worse and worse ! " cried the Duchess,
putting up her hands as though toward
off his words ; " that surely is
the agony point of your story. Don't
tell me any more harrowing details.
1 don't think I could stand anymore
1 "

Well, / will spare you, but Lady Lyne-stone
will have a good deal more to add
in a quiet tete-astute. You had better hear
it all ; the story is not half completed yet.

VOL. III. I

After luncheon you may feel stronger, and
better able to stand up against it," he
laughed quizzically. "And, after all, it
will come mild from the Countess's lips.
Eemember she had to hear it all from that
Italian volcano ; and give her all your
best sympathy."

"And that I will," said her Grace
kindly. " There's the gong, and my
bonnet it still on ! "

The two ladies retired to the Duchess's
boudoir after luncheon, while the gentlemen
repaired to the smoking-room, and
both the Countess and Lord Carruthers
told their strange stories from beginning
to end.

A scoundrel of the blackest dye! " cried
the Duke indignantly. " I hope he will
never cross my path again. I am greatly
obliged to you for your action in the
matter in clearing him out of my house
as you have done. To think of my wife

and Lady Limestone being in the company
of such a ruffian makes my blood
boil ! "

My dear, what an escape ! " cried the
Duchess, looking white and troubled. " /
introduced you to the man, and I should
never have forgiven myself if harm had
come to you. Lord Carruthers behaved
splendidly. Fancy his remaining in the
room all the time ; but your knowing he
was there must have made you feel safe
and secure."

It did, indeed. I should have fainted
if I had been alone."

Poor girl. Well ! it is all over now."

Yes, that is indeed something to be
thankful for ; and, Duchess, when are you
coming to Limestone, for I must really go
home now? I have enjoyed my visit to
you very much ; but I have so many
things to see to, which greatly need my
attention."

"Very well, Rosamond. I believe in
speeding the parting guest, as much as
in welcoming; the comines one."

*rand Lord Carruthers is coming too,"
continued the Countess, with a rosy blush ;
if you will bring him down."

The Duchess threw her arms around her
friend's neck, and kissed her.

"Oh! is he'' she laughed; 'well, Rosy,
you couldn't do better."

The blushes grew deeper and deeper.

Oh ! indeed no ! there is nothing of
that sort," she protested. " He has
been very, very kind to me, that is
all."

Oh ! that is all, small woman, is it ? "
said her Grace, laughing still. " Well, we
shall see."

Dear Duchess, indeed we are only
friends ! " asserted the Countess earnestly.


Well, friends are very nice things



Easy, when they are made of the right
stuff ! I wish you joy of your friendship.
I will certainly bring Lord Carruthers down
to Limestone."

LORD Carruthers LAST LOVE.

ORD Carruthers started
that afternoon for Axminster
Towers, having telegraphed fora
carriage to meet him at the station.

The following morning his first act was
to go and see his old governess, Miss
Wheeler, and to her he confided the whole
story of poor Marie Paravisso, whom she
willingly undertook to receive, and to
carry out his lordship's charitable plans
for.

Then he ordered his horse, and rode to

the Eectory of Winsthorpe, and saw with
a sense of chill that the house was deserted.
Nevertheless, he knocked at the door, which
was answered by one of the old servants,
who gave him the details of Mr Thorn-dyke's
death, with honest tears in her
eyes, and told him that Mrs and Miss
Thorndyke were now staying at Marsden
Hall, so he mounted again and rode
on.

Sir Richard was walking up and down
his garden in the sunshine, with an
unusual look of sadness upon his fine
face. He took his watch from his pocket
as his lordship drew rein beside him.

Well timed, Carruthers ! " he said
heartily. "Luncheon will be ready in
five minutes, and you must join us.
Lilian will be very pleased to see you,
and we have friends with us who will
give you a welcome too. The Thorndykes
are here. We have lost the poor old

Eector ; not so old either, but he's gone,
and we shall never see his like in
Winsthorpe again. I've given the living
to Bob Lake ; he has a good heart, and
he knows Thorndyke's ways. I don't
wish anything altered in the church or
parish. It has been a terrible loss for
the poor wife and daughter, and I venture
to think Adela has felt it even more
keenly than her mother ; hers is a very
intense nature  she feels acutely. Mrs
Thorndyke's is a more even temperament.
You will find Adela greatly altered."

She was sitting alone in the drawing-room
when Sir Eichard ushered him in,
and he acknowledged to himself that
the Baronet's judgment had been correct.

The sparkle had died out of her eyes,
but there was a greater depth and intensity
in their beauty. She was altered,
etherealised, changed, but she was equally
lovely.

There was no time for conversation,
for luncheon was announced almost as
soon as they entered the room, and Lilian
and Mrs Thorndyke joined them.

Lord Carruthers looked at Adela several
times during the meal, with a strange
uncertainty as to his feelings towards
her. There was a deep and earnest pity
for her in his great heart, but the old
ecstatic thrill at being in her presence
was wanting. He was very glad to see
her  very ; but there was no wild demonstration
in his feeling towards her.
He was more than sorry for her trouble.
Her evident mental anguish touched him.
He longed to comfort and help her, and
he kept himself bravely up to the determination
of once more offering her the
shelter of his home.

When luncheon was over, he again found
himself alone with her ; it was Lilian's
doing. She drew the others away, with

the vague hope that Adeki might be
wise at last, and turn to a lover
who had been so true and steadfast to
her.

"Adela," said Lord Carruthers, coming
straight to the point, " I have only
lately heard of your sorrow, or I should
have written to assure you of my
deepest sympathy. I was among your
good father's sincerest admirers."

I am sure of it," she answered, with
trembling lips. " I felt certain you did
not know ; you were always so kind and
thoughtful."

I wish you would let me be kind
to you, dear girl," he answered tenderly ;
but he was quiet and calm, and he wondered
at himself.

His first offer to her had been made
in so very different a manner and spirit.
If she accepted him, he should be very
fond of her, and very good to her, but

the passion she had for years inspired
had worn itself out.

She looked up at him inquiringly.
To her the question of love had been
settled between them, and she did not
catch his meaning.

Adela," he continued, '* you are looking
sad ; let me comfort you, my dear.
Can you not now make up your mind
to share my home ? I conclude you
will have to leave your old one. I have
become older, and more staid in these
days. I do not expect anything very
startling in the shape of happiness to
come my way. When once the first
bright dream fades, we have to be content
with something more prosaic ; but,
Adela, I think we might be very happy
together if you will try, and I need not
say I want to take care of your mother
too."

This is very kind of you. Lord Carruthers

! " she answered, with a faint
smile, "Most kind."

Kind ! Why ? "

She had found him out. She knew
that the old ring had left his voice.

Because you no longer love me," she
said bravely, " and you are willing to
make me your wife, simply to take
care of me for the sake of the old love
which is now dead."

Adela, my dear, you pain me," he
said, with a gathering certainty that she
was right. " Indeed I wish you to be
my wife."

Yes ! It was for your own sake
once ; now it is for mine, and mine
alone. My kind, generous friend, had it
been ever so much for yours, my answer
must have been the same. I love another :
hind, Lord Carruthers, if you told me the
truth, so do you ! Nought but that
could have changed you so completely."

'' Am I changed, Adela ? " he asked,
with a strange mistrust of himself. " If
I am, I do not know it ; I have not
realised the fact."

No ? then you soon will ! My friend,,
may you be very, very happy."

Have you qiiite decided against me % "
he asked gravely.

Quite."

The third time, then, has not proved
lucky."

Yes it has. You are going to be
very happy."

** And you ? "

Tears started to her eyes.

Do not think about me," she
answered, " I shall do very well."

Then he went away, and left her
alone, but not before they had clasped
hands as real friends once more.

She felt a little more desolate when
he was gone, thinking what a happy

wife she might have been if only she
had loved him.

And he?

He knew not whether to be glad
or sorry at her refusal.

Had she accepted him, when her
heart was given to another, he could
have looked for little happiness as her
husband ; and yet he longed to protect
and cherish her  the chivalry in
his nature spoke for her.

So he rode back to his home, and
somehow it had never looked so cold
and dull to him, the summer sunshine
seemed a mockery, he felt so very much
alone.

He remained some days at the Towers,
transacting business connected \dth the
estate, which required his attention, and
then he returned to town, taking Miss
Wheeler with him ; and having conducted
her to the quiet, unpretentious

street where Signora Cavenci was lodging,
he introduced the ladies to each other, and
having o-iven the former carte blanche
to obtain whatever she thought necessary
for the comfort of his protege,
he went away, and left them alone together.


In a few days Miss Wheeler had fitted
up Marie with such things as she required,
and they drove off to the
station in a cab, to the intense regret
of Mrs Rawlins, who declared she never
before had had a lodger who gave so
little trouble.

She's a gentle creature ! " she murmured,
as the fly rumbled out of sight ;
and I wish I could have kept her
here, and that I do ; but there, I must
not be selfish," and she leisurely hung
the card again up in her window, to
signify to the public that her lodgings
were to let.

Lord Carruthers called upon the
Duchess of St Ives, and found her at
home, but Lady Limestone had left
her.

I am going to visit her next week,"
said her Grace, in answer to his inquiries
for the Countess, " and I understand
you are to accompany me to
Limestone ? "

Thank you, if I should not be in
the way."

Not in the least ; T shall be glad
of your escort. The Duke is deeply
involved in politics, and has declined to
go with me ; but what on earth you
will find to do down there puzzles me.
Shooting has not begun, or you would
have found the covers of Limestone good,
I am told."

Lady Limestone has promised me
some fishing," he laughed ; " and I suppose
it has never struck you that I

shall be pleased to escort the ladies in
their walks and rides and drives. You
will find me a very domesticated man
I assure you, Duchess."

'* A carpet knight, eh ? Well, I shall
not object to your company, and I daresay
the Countess will manage to put
up with it too ; and then you can nurse
the boy," she added mischievously. " I
hope you have a good store of those
interesting tales, one of which I so
cruelly broke in two."

Oh ! we can finish it another time,"
he returned, smiling. " Perhaps you will
kindly let me know the day and hour
you start ? "

*' I can tell you that now, if you
don't object to the trouble of looking
out the trains."

Not in the least, if you have a
Bradshaw."

"Would you mind ringing for it?"

VOL. III. K

she asked ; and so they made all arrangements
to leave town that day
Aveek.

Limestone was bathed in a flood of
golden sunshine as Lord Carruthers first
saw it, and the breeze and sun combined
in making the lake one blaze of
bright scintillating wavelets, like diamonds.


The old trees were still fresh and green
and beautiful. The gentle deer grazed
the tender grass fearlessly, for they were
all pets of the Countess, and came to
her to be fed with bread.

She was standing upon the massive
steps, under the colossal portico, waiting
to receive them.

You see I cannot be conventional,"
she said, giving a hand to each of her
guests. " Welcome ! right welcome to
Limestone ! "

We have left conventionality in

London, Eose, and have come to enjoy
ourselves in the country," laughed the
Duchess. " I begin to feel quite young
already, without my grave husband and
my children. It is to be hoped the freedom
of Limestone wont make me too
skittish, my dear, but I really feel up to
any mischief at the present time. Cannot
you find any for me to do ? "

Lady Limestone laughed.

"What have you done with your
dignity, Duchess ? I have heard you
called the most dignified woman in
Society ! "

"Just so, dear. I keep it for Society.
The Duke likes it, because he
is considerably older than I am, but
now I have packed it up with my coronet.
I shall not want either while I am at
Limestone," and she gave the Countess
a, hearty hug.

"Has she been like this all the way

down ? " asked Lady Limestone, smiling
up at Lord Carruthers. " If so, you
must have had a lively journey."

No ; it must be the effect of this
crisp, clear air. It has only just come
on, I assure you, and I think it must
be contagious, for, do you know, I feel
very much like it myself; and yet
when I was down at Warminster Towers
there seemed to be no gladness in the
sunshine," he answered, laughing.

"My dear," said the Duchess, "do
you ride ? "

I used to do so, before  before  "

I understand."

I have not since then."

"Then you must commence again tomorrow.
The Duke does not allow me
to ride. He says my life is too valuable
with my young family, but I am going
to begin tomorrow with you. I have
brought down my habit with me, and

shall not I enjoy a scamper once more !
It will be like old times ! "

But, dear Duchess, if the Duke heard
of it, would he not be vexed ? '

Now, Rose, I didn't expect preaches
from you. Of course he would,
but he would get over it. I can look so
wonderfully pathetic if lie is angry, he
soon melts; but lie won't hear of it unless
I tell him myself, which is more than
likely to happen in a soft moment, if he
is unusually nice ! "

I am glad you mean to tell him,"
replied the Countess. " 1 should enjoy it
above all things ! "

And so should I, ' said Lord Carruthers.

So the rides began the very next day.

But it was only a ruse of the Duchess's
to throw her friends together, and as
often as not she declined at the last
moment to accompany them.

She was loyal as loyal could be to

the Duke, and he was fully kept acquainted
with her daily actions, in letters,
which, if not voluminous, were full of
matter and point, with a quaint vein of
humour running; through them.

She put herself to actual inconvenience
to remain for a long visit at Limestone,
feeling that when she left, Lord Carruthers
must do so too, and he showed no inclination
to say farewell ; but it came at last.

The Duke wrote that he could spare
her no longer, and the walks and the
rides, the fairy tales, and the summer
evenings spent in the beautiful old
garden must be brought to a close.

It was the last day that they were
to spend there, and their visit had lasted
a month  a bright and happy month.

It had passed like a pleasant dream
to Lord Carruthers. Each day he grew
more conscious of the beauty and charms
of Lady Limestone.

She and the Duchess were strolling
along arm-in-arm, and he was walking
beside them, with a cigar in his hand,
but he had forgotten to light it.

Summer was waning, the evenings
were closing in.

The gloaming was creeping on, and
the stars were beginning to glisten in
the sky like bayonet points.

It grows chilly," said the Duchess,
with a pretended shiver. '' I shall fetch
a wrap."

Let me get you one," said her hostess,
but her Grace would not hear of it, and
an entreating look from Lord Carruthers
settled the question.

It is his last chance for the present,"
soliloquised the Duchess, as she turned,
before entering the mansion, to look after
them. " And he has not the sense I give
him credit for, if he loses the opportunity."


She laughed as she settled herself in
the drawing-room, by the soft light of a
reading-lamp, and took up the novel which
lay open on the table.

It will take me an hour to finish,"
she continued, smiling still. " He ought
to manage it in that time. Well, she
will make him a loving little wife, and he 
he's the nicest man I know, except the
Duke, of course," she added mentally, and
was soon deep in the love-story before
her.

Lady Limestone, I was afraid you were
going to run away," said Lord Carruthers ;
*' this is our last evening together, you
know, and I do not want to lose you forever
such a little time."

She gave him no answer, but she looked
up at him with a smile.

Shall you be sorry when I leave you ? "
he asked, drawing very near to her.

Very," she answered, in a low voice ;

*' the old place will seem sad and lonely
when you and the Duchess are gone."

Eosamond," he said, taking possession
of her hand ; *' my own home is utterly
desolate. What is a home with no beloved
companion to share it ? Why should we
live apart ? I love you earnestly and
truly, as I never expected to love again ! '"

Again ? " she repeated, in surprise.

Yes ; it is only right you should
know the truth.

'No, thou art not my first love,' "

He quoted, 

' I had loved before we met ;
And the memory of that early dream,

Is pleasant to me yet.
But then thou art my last love,

My dearest and my best ;
My heart but shed its outer leaves,

To give thee all the rest.'

I loved once, very, very dearly, but my
love was not reciprocated, and is now a
thing of the past."

Was it Adela % " she asked shyly.

"Yes, it was Delaware

you sure she does not care for
you?"

Quite."

She breathed more freely. This man
had become so much to her, that she felt
how hard it would be to give him up
even to one she cared for as she did for
Adela Thorndyke.

I am glad," she said simply.

His arm crept about her, the darkness
was deepening, and the stars were twinkling
overhead.

Eosamond, may I come back ? " he asked
tenderly. " I never knew what a lonely
thing life was till I felt the miss of you when
we parted in town. My darling, if not
my first, you are my last dear, dear love,
and I must transplant you to my home ! "

Do you want me to leave Limestone % "
she asked wistfully.

"No, it would not be fair to expect
that ! Could we not spend half
our time here, and half at Warminster
Towers ? "

She nestled a little closer to his
side.

Eose, you do love me, do you not?"
he asked, earnestly stopping to gaze upon
her fair face in the dusk.

With all my heart," she answered, ina
low, soft whisper. " Oh, Eeginald, I
know now that you are my first and last
love. I was very fond of dear Lord
Limestone  he was so good to me ; but
I loved him as the father I had never
known, and mourned him truly  but
oh, my dear, it was not love. I
did not know it then, but I know it
now."

Thank Heaven I " he murmured, and
gathered her closely to his breast.

Do you know what has kept me

silent all this month, Rose ? It was no
doubt of my feelings for you, but a
dread lest you still loved your dead lord,
and that I should have the shadow,
and not the reality, of your affection."

You need have no fear, love," she
whispered. " I am all your own, and
I am so, so happy."

My love, my dear, dear love ! " he
murmured, and pressed his lips to hers
in a fervent loving kiss.

They married in the end, of course,"
said the Duchess to herself, as she tossed
down the third volume ; " they always
do," and she looked up to see Lord Carruthers
and the Countess before her arm-in-arm.


"Hallo!" she laughed, "so it is settled.
You have been so long about it
I began to think I must have made a
mistake ; but I wish you both every joy.

May Lord Carruthers make you as good
a husband as the Duke has been to me,
my little Rosamond, and you will be a
happy woman."

wmm.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY.

she good-natured Duke let his
wife go back to Limestone
early in September, to help
the Countess with various arrangements
for her marriage, and promised to
run down for a few days' shooting
the following week.

Lady Limestone had written to
Colonel Eo-eton to tell him of her engagement
; and when he read her letter
his fury knew no bounds.

That this Lord Carruthers should

trie with the affections of the woman
he loved, and divide her from him, ashe
had done, and then turn from her
to another, was unbearable.

No doubt it was the Countess's wealth
which had tempted him, but she should
not be thus duped.

He obtained leave and hastened to
England.

If his uncle's widow married this man
she should do it with her eyes open,
with the full knowledge of his unmanly-conduct.


He was in a perfect fume through
the whole journey from Malta to Lyne-stone,
and startled her by coming in
upon her without the faintest notice of
his advent.

Her lover and the Duke had arrived
the night before, and she felt pleased
that she would be able to introduce
them both to him.

Gracious, Cecil ! " she said kindly.
have you dropped from the clouds ?
Whoever expected to see you ? Well,
though unexpected, you are not the less
welcome, believe me. I did not know
you were in England," and she shook
his hand warmly.

I have come over in answer to your
letter, Rosamond," he said gravely.
You cannot know what sort of a man
this Lord Carruthers is, or you would
scarcely have given your happiness into
his hands. You shall not become his
wife if I can help it. My good old
uncle wished me to be your friend and
adviser, and I have come home to help
you. It will be a blow to you, I daresay,
but Eosamond, my dear aunt, you
must give him up."

The Countess became very pale.

I cannot believe anything against
the man I love," she said firmly. " If

you have aught to say to his detriment,
speak plainly, Colonel Egerton."

Would you marry a black-hearted
villain ? " he asked, in agitation.

Certainly not," she replied, with
quiet dignity.

Then that is what this man is."

You must either prove your words,
or apologise for them, Cecil."

I ivill prove them."

He sprang from his chair, and paced
the room in great excitement, then stopped
before her suddenly.

Rosamond, have you ever guessed
that I have suffered ? Have you ever
guessed that all my love was once
given to a woman, and the happiness
of my life wrecked ? " he asked, with
emotion.

She forgot her anger towards him,
and looked up at him with kindly sympathy.


VOL. III. L

I have thought you unhappy, Cecil,
often."

And do you know who ruined my
peace of mind ? No, how should you ?
It was this man whom you Avould wed.
Lord Carruthers ! You know the girl I
loved ; it was Adela Thorndyke ! She
and I were engaged, and he stepped in
between us, and made her false to me ;
and having; taken her from me, having
parted us, he had not the honour to
marry her himself. Such men ought to
be hunted out of society. They are the
curse of it," he said fiercely. " Do you
think such a man is calculated to make
you happy?"

Lady Limestone sat in deep) thought,
while Colonel Egerton again paced the
room like a caged panther.

Cecil," she answered gently, " don't
you think there has been some ugly
mistake ? Lord Carruthers did love Adelaide

told me so himself  but he was never
able to gain her affection."

The soldier's face worked with passion.

He deceives you ! I heard him speak
words of love to her, not the pleading
of a man who seeks, but such as are born
of mutual confidence. I saw him give
her letters too, and she held meetings
with him  clandestine meetings."

Lady Limestone got up and rang the
bell, and when the servant entered, she
asked if Lord Carruthers were within the
house, and was informed that he had just
returned from shooting, and was in his
own room.

So she desired the butler should let
his lordship know that she wished to see
him as soon as possible in the drawing-room,
and the man went to obey her
orders.

No word passed between these two for
some time ; then Eosamond went to Cecil

Egerton's side, and laid her hand upon his
arm.

Cecil," she said, " you will be happy
yet. Eeginald can explain it all, I am
sure."

'' Explain ! " he returned bitterly ; " he
may forge a story to satisfy a confiding
woman, but not one which will deceive a
man of the world. No, Rosamond, there
can be no joy for me in this life ! "

The door opened, and Lord Carruthers
and Colonel Egerton stood face to face.

The Countess watched their meeting
with actual surprise, for upon the countenance
of neither was there the faintest
sign of recognition.

Her Chance came to her side at once.

Did you send for me, Rosamond ? " he
asked unconcernedly.

Yes, I wanted you to see my nephew,
Colonel Egerton," she answered. "You
have met before, I think."

He advanced with outstretched hand.

No ; I have never had that pleasure,"
he replied, " and am glad that we have
met at last. I have often heard of you,
Colonel Egerton, and I hope we shall
prove good friends."

This it not Lord Carruthers ! " said
Cecil, looking from one to the other in
bewilderment.

Of course it is," she laughed ; " if you
won't believe me you can refer to the
Duke and Duchess of St Ives, who are
now staying with me. Cecil, it strikes
me you are labouring under some great
misapprehension."

It appears that I am," he replied
gravely. " Rosamond, I freely apologise.
This is not the gentleman to whom I referred.
I withdraw my former remarks
and opposition."

Then he turned to Lord Carruthers.

I have unintentionally borne false

witness against you," he said, with a faint
smile, " but I cannot explain my error to
you, as it involves a lady's name. I mistook
you for some one else, for whom I
have not a kindly feeling. Now, if you
will offer me your hand again I can clasp
it with satisfaction. I congratulate both
you and Lady Limestone heartily, and if
I can give you away, Rosamond, before I
return to my regiment, I will do so with
pleasure."

I should like that of all things," said
the Countess ; " and you will stay with us,
Cecil ? "

I am afraid I shall prove restless,
Rosamond, but I will stay if you promise
not to be offended should I suddenly be
missing;. You see I have so long; been
my own master, that if the freak takes me
to go anywhere, or do anything, I go,
and ask no one."

We will not trammel your old bachelor

ways," she laughed. " Come and go when
you like, Cecil ; we will ask no questions,
either when you vanish or reappear."

So it was settled that Colonel Egerton
should remain, and he did so.

The marriage was fixed for that day
month, and arrangements for the happy
event went briskly on.

The Colonel spoke the truth when he
asserted that he was restless.

He went away sometimes for hours,
sometimes for days, and said nothing of
his movements, taking Lady Limestone
at her word, and resuming his place in
the house as the privileged person he
was.

My dear," said the Duchess of St Ives,
your nephew is a very charming man
when he chooses, but surely he must be
some very near relation to the ' Wandering
Jew % ' He never seems happy two days
running in the same place. What a very

uncomfortable sort of husband he would
make ? "

Perhaps he is not very happy,"
returned Lady Limestone leniently ; " and
I do not mind his coming and going as he
does at all."

You ever were a kind little creature,
Rosie," said the elder woman affectionately.
*' Lord Carruthers ought to be well contented
with his choice."

I think he is," she answered, half
shyly, "and I know I am with mine."

He had entered the room in time to
hear her remark, and laid his hand upon
her shoulder, looking lovingly down
into her speaking face, and the Duchess
slipped away before they perceived her
absence.

He passed his arm through hers, and
drew her to the window. Cecil Egerton
was walking up and down the garden
with bent head.

My darling, Egerton is a good fellow,
but a very miserable one, I fear ; can
we do nothing to dispel the clouds which
appear to envelop him ? "

The Countess watched him, and her
face saddened.

'* I wish we could, but I don't know
how it is to be done.

Then after a pause she added, 

Eeginald, I cannot bear having
secrets from you, even though they are
other people's. I must tell you about
poor Cecil's trouble, and you will feel
for him. I should have told you before,
but somehow it seems to throw blame
upon Adela, and I did not like to do
that."

Upon Adela ? " he said, in surprise.


Yes, dear, Cecil has loved her for
years, and it appears that at one time
he was engaged to her."

He must then be the man she has
so long worshipped ! " he cried excitedly.
*' My darling, you must throw them
together again. It will all come right
yet, I hope."

I don't know, Reginald. He says
she gave him up for some one else, and,
strange to relate, he thought you were
the man who had supplanted him until
he saw you."

"He has seen his rival then?" he
asked, with a puzzled look.

Evidently ! "

He looked out at the figure pacing
the terrace.

He has made some mistake," he said
decidedly. " I am convinced that he is
the individual for whose sake Adela
refused me three times."

Three times ! " repeated the Countess,
with a pained start.

"Just so, dearest," he answered, with

heartwliole honesty, " and she cured me
by showing me her fervent affection and
admiration for Cecil Egerton."

Did she tell you it was for Cecil ? "

Certainly not, my little innocent."

If you are right, Eeginald," she said
reflectively, " who can it be that made
him so jealous ? "

I cannot imagine ! Rosie, why don't
you ask her ? "

Ex," she replied, " 1 will, I really
will, and that will end the matter. And
now I want your advice. Do you think I
might invite her to our wedding ? Then
she would meet Cecil, and who knows
what might take place ? " she ended
brightly.

You must not let him know she is
coming," he laughed, '' or he would be off
like a shot."

I have thought of that," she said,,
joining in his fun ; " and I have decided

that you and the Duke must take him out
shooting, and not let him come home till
nearly dinner time, so that they will meet
in the drawings-room when the fionf
sounds, and there will be no loophole for
retreat."

You're a clever little woman, Elsie ! "
and he drew her closer to his side.

Mark my words, it will all come
right for Adela and for Egerton. Poor
Adela ! She has suffered terribly ; she
has such a strange, far - off, pathetic
look now, Elsie, you would grieve to
see it."

I am sure I should  but, Ex, suppose
she won't come ? "

We must persuade her. I think she
will, for she is very fond of us both, and
if she thought her absence would vex us,
she would put her own sorrow aside and
come. She is very unselfish and generous.
What exceedingly nice letters she wrote tous

both when she heard of our engagement
! You can tell her, Rosie, how very
quiet our wedding is to be."

Of course I will, and so must you.
We will both write."

Very well, pet, we will. Hullo ! what
has become of Egerton ? I thought he
was training for a place in the Zoo ; but
he has lengthened his tether this time,
and taken himself out of sight," and that
was the last they saw of him for several
days.

Sir Eichard had kept his word. A new
Rectory was being built for Bob Lake, close
to the church, and he had made a deed
of gift of the old one to Mrs Thorndyke.

It was so totally unexpected that the
thought of going back to her old home,
upset her even more than leaving it had
done. Sir Richard was standing, with a
sad and bewildered face, talking to Horace.

My boy, what things women are ! "
he said impatiently. " One never knows
how to take them. I have turned Bob out
of his rightful home, because poor Thorn-dyke's
widow nearly broke her heart at
the thought of leaving it ; and now it is her
own to return to when she likes, and she
receives the news with a flood of tears,
enough to shake a man's nerves for the remainder
of his life. I thought she would
be overjoyed, and I'm disappointed ! "

That is just it. Sir Richard ; she is
overjoyed," said Horace, with a smile.
The happiness was almost too much for
her. She had dreaded g-oins; out into
the world to find a new home, but she
had strung up her nerves to bear it. Suddenly
all the pressure has been removed,
and the relief has been too great to be expressed
in words. She is unstrung, now
that the strain is over ; I can understand
her feeling-s."

In another moment Adela made a third
in the group.

She came up to the Baronet with both
hands outstretched, and a look of excitement
upon her pale face.

How good you are ! " she said simply.
Poor mother ! next to losing dear father,
came losing her home in the scale of sorrow,
and you have given her back this great comfort.
Oh ! Sir Eichard, let me thank you for
her, until she can find words to do so herself."

Is she really pleased ? " he asked
dubiously.

Pleased ! " she echoed. " The word
does not one quarter express her thankfulness,
nor mine," she added.

Well, Adela, I am very, very glad to
have been of some little use to you and
your mother, ' he said, with a gratified
look. " My dear, may you both be very
happy in your old home. You will find
every thing there just as you left it."

So Mrs Thorndyke and Adela returned
to Winsthorpe Old Eectory, as it was now
called, and their first act was to place a
white cross over their dear one's resting-place.
It was very chaste and pure-looking,
and massive too, standing alone in the
bend of the chancel in a little garden, and
they planted ferns and flowers about, to
keep it bright and beautiful.

Adela and her mother were falling back
into their old places in the parish. Everyone
appealed to them as of yore. Bob
Lake had gone away for a time, but was
shortly to return, and take possession of his
new home.

In the meanwhile a '' locum tenens " had
been found to take his duties, who, unfortunately,
seemed to give satisfaction to no
one, from Sir Eichard to the poorest man
in the parish. So he did not have a very
lively time of it.

One afternoon, as Adela was dressing a

cross of blossoms to place upon her father's
grave, Horace and Lilian came in to afternoon
tea.

I won't be long, Lil," said Adela, " but
I want just to carry these flowers to the
churchyard. You won't mind chatting
with mother till I come back, will
you ? "

Not I ; we shall be very glad to get
rid of you," answered her friend brightly.
And Horace shall be your beast of
burden, won't you, dear ? "

"Father!" he exclaimed, jumping up,
and taking forcible possession of the
tin.

Don't, Horace 1 you will spill the
water ! " she cried. " See ! you have upset
it all down your trousers."

'well if I have," he laughed, " it won't
hurt."

'but our carpets will! What a slop
you are making 1 There won't be a

VOL. III. M

drop left in it by the time we get
there."

Then you shall carry a jug of water
to refill it," he decided ; and thus laden,
the two went off side by side.

The corner where the Eector rested was
hidden from the path they traversed by
the church wall ; and when they turned
the sudden angle, a man was leaning over
the grave, placing on it a rarely beautiful
wreath of white flowers.

At the sound of their footsteps he looked
up, and the eyes of Adela Thorndyke and
Cecil Egerton met once more.

A spasm of uncontrollable joy swept
through her heart, and set it beating
wildly, but Horace was by her side again,
and Cecil's looks and words were cold.

** I came to visit my old friend's ,"
he said gravely, taking off
his hat to her ; '' but I had no idea of
intruding upon you, believe me."

My mother would be glad to see you ;
she would like to thank you for the
flowers," faltered poor Adela, extending
her hand, which he touched as a stranger
might do.

'' I have felt very much grieved at the
loss of my old brother officer," he continued,
with some show of feeling, " and
can sympathise with you and Mrs Thorn-dyke
in your trouble."

Tears rolled up into the girl's eyes, and
blinded her, and held her voice captive.

Again he touched her finger-tips, and
again he raised his hat, and once more
she was alone.

They had yet again met and parted.
Horace had moved on among the tombstones,
but seeing that the Colonel was
gone, he returned to Adela's side.

Are you ready to place the flowers,
Dela ? " he asked, taking no notice of her
sad and agitated face.

"Do it for me to-day, Horace," she
answered, leaning up against the church
for support. "I  I  don't feel very
well."

He did as she bade him, then drew her
hand within his arm.

"Come, Dela," he said kindly, "I
shall take you home ; you're not the
thing, and ought not to have come
out at all. You "trust have change of
air."

But for all that he felt certain that
Cecil Egerton had been the cause of her
sudden indisposition.

Well, perhaps I shall," she answered
wearily. " Lady Limestone wants me so
very much to go down to her wedding,
and does not object to my black garments.
I have no heart for it, Horace ;
but since she and Lord Carruthers are,
next to you and Lil and Sir Richard, my
dearest friends, I hardly see my way to

refusing, when they make such a point of
it, and they assure me it is to be a very
quiet affair."

Of course you must go ! " he said decidedly,
and chatted on till they reached
the old Eectory.

And Cecil Egerton stood, unseen, watching
them ascend the hill, gnawing the
ends of his brown moustache fiercely the
while.

Fool that I was to come here' he
muttered, as he struck ofi" for the road
leading to the station.

She went up to her own chamber
when they reached the Eectory, and
Horace beckoned Lilian from the room.

That confounded old young man has
turned up again, Lil," he said, " and has
upset poor Dela, just as she was getting
a little better. She has gone upstairs ;
don't you think you had better go and
look after her ? "

What, Cecil Egerton ! " cried Lilian ;
and you say he has gone again ? "

I didn't say so, Lil, but I haven't a
doubt of it. He looked more like the
ghost in Hamlet than ever. Evidently
tragedy is the gentleman's line ; an insufferably
pretentious fellow. I feel quite
antagonistic towards him."

"Never mind your feelings, old man,
think of Dela's. Can't you stop him anyhow
? "

I ? Bless me, child, you must be losing
your reason ; I don't even know the
man. How can I run after him and say,
Hi ! you here, my Lilian says you're to
come back ? ' "

No, no, of course you can't ; but, oh !
Horace, I am so sorry for Scamp."

And she hurried upstairs after her
friend.

Horace stood looking at her retreating
form.

I always felt sure there was someone,
but I am sorry it is that fellow," he
said, in a tone of disgust, and turned into
the drawing-room to keep Mrs Thorndyke
from looking after the girls, and, all praise
to his discretion, he did not mention
Adela's meeting with her father's old
friend.

Oh ! Lilian, Lilian ! " cried Adela, as
she clasped her in her arms, " I have
seen him again ; and my heart will
break''

LORD AND LADY LYNESTONE.

HEN Colonel Egerton returned
to Limestone, he was more
thoughtful, more sad, than ever.
There was a new vein of bitterness and
moroseness in his speeches, and thoughts,
which somewhat astonished his hearers ;
but preparations for the wedding kept
them all fully occupied, and they had
but little time to analyse the feelings of
the cynical Colonel.

After much persuasion, Adela had
promised to come a few days prior to the

wedding, so as to see a little of Rosamond
before she should leave Limestone with
her husband, and the Countess was looking
forward to her visit very much, and
drove to the station to meet her, Cecil
having been spirited away to a distant
cover after the long tails.

The meeting between the friends was
a very warm one, and Rosamond talked
to Adela about Lord Carruthers without
reserve, letting her know fully that she
was aware of the love for her which had
existed so long in his heart, and thus
they chatted on until Limestone came
in sight.

"Is it not a dear old place, Adela ? "
she said, as the girl's eyes rested upon
it in deep admiration. " You know it
would have belonged to our mutual
friend, my husband's nephew, if Lord
Limestone had not married me," and she
looked intently at Adela, whose speaking

face changed painfully. '' What ! don't
you still like Colonel Egerton ? " asked
the wicked little Countess, in feigned
surprise.

We used to be friends once," she
faltered, " but we have scarcely met for
years."

Well ! he has not forgotten you,
Adela ; but stay, I must tell you the rest
when we get indoors. Here is the avenue,
is it not a grand one ? Would it not
have been strange if you had been the
mistress here, instead of me ? " she
laughed.

Adela Thorndyke flushed hotly, and
followed her hostess from the carriage
up the steps, into the fine old hall, and
the oaken staircase, into a room like a
fairy's bower, which had been prepared
expressly for her, all satin wood, and
pale blue satin and lace, with delicate
cretonne upon the walls.

I call this the ' girls' chamber,' " said
Lady Limestone. " I don't fancy they
appreciate majestic old apartments, which
look as though a dozen ghosts may
tenant them at night. What do you
say, Adela ? "

I am not afraid of the ghosts," she
answered, with a smile ; " and this room
is too utterly charming, but I am very
conservative. I should like the old
rooms to be kept as they are, it would
seem sacrilege to alter them."

You would have won Lord Lyne-stone's
heart by such a speech," said
Eosamond warmly. Then after a pause,
she took her by both hands, and looked
into her face. " Adela, if Lord Limestone
had known that his nephew loved a girl
like you, who would have cherished the
old place, and followed out his wishes
I doubt very much whether he would
ever have married," she said earnestly.

Who said his nephew loved me ? "
asked Adela, her voice shaking with
agitation. " I have never told you so,
Rosamond."

''No, but he has."

He ! when ? " she gasped.

Nearly a month ago, when he first
arrived in England. He came down to
try and prevent my marrying Reginald,
being under some mis-impression that he
had behaved badly to you."

How very unfortunate ! " said the
girl.

Not at all, when they met he
found he had made a mistake. By-the
- bye, Adela, who was the gentleman
whom he mistook for Lord carruthers
? "

Poor Adela covered her face with
her hands, and when she removed them
she was very white.

Rosamond, what did he tell you ? "

she asked, with sudden calmness. " I
cannot lose your good opinion."

He told me that you and he were
engaged, and that he loved you dearly,
and believed in your affection for him,
but that you held clandestine meetings
with another, whom he supposed to be
Lord Carruthers ; that he had heard words
of love between you, and had seen him
give you love letters."

"Did you believe this of me, Rosamond
? " she asked, with feeling.

No, Adela ! Both Reginald and
I feel sure you can give some explanation,
however black it looked against
you."

Thanks," she said heartily, pressing,
her hand.

Then again she flushed.

Does Lord Carruthers know all that ? "'

"Yes; I told him."

And what did he say ? "

He told me to ask you for the truth,
Dek."

'you shall have it," she answered, with
feeling, ** because you trusted me. It was
Horace Lake. You know we have been
friends from childhood, but perhaps you
do not know that for a very long time
his love for Lilian Freemantle was a prohibited
thing."

Yes, I knew that too ; she told me
what an angel you had been to her in
her trouble."

She did not tell you all I had suffered
for her sake," replied Adela with a sad
smile, '* for she did not know it herself !
I never told her why Cecil and I
parted."

Why was it, dear ? "

I used to do Mercury for them, and
convey their love-letters, and Cecil surprised
Horace and me together, and
Horace dropped a part of one of his letters

to Lilian, and Cecil picked it up, and
naturally it seemed to him to have been
written to me."

'did you tell him that it was not?"

Yes ; I asked him to trust me, and
he couldn't. He would not be satisfied
without an explanation of everything,
which I could not give him, for, of course,
I could not betray Lilian's confidence ;
and, Eosamond, it seems as if fate were
against me. We met ao;ain at Mentone,
and Horace was with me ; and only a few
clays since we met once more at my
fathers grave, and Horace was there too,
for he had carried down my flowers."

'' Well, dear, you may meet again,
and if so, you surely will tell him the
truth ; it cannot hurt Lilian now."

"Gladly would I if he were to ask me ;
but I could not volunteer such information.
It would be like inviting him to
come back to me."

*' And suppose you did ask him ? He
loves you ! "

"It is very easy to say that, Eose ;
but put yourself in my place. If Lord
Carruthers had misjudged and mistrusted
you, hould you do it ? "

I am afraid I shouldn't," she confessed,
" but I should be very miserable."


So have I been, Heaven knows ! "

Poor girl ! Well, there is nothing
so soothing as a cup of tea. Come into
my boudoir, and we will finish our
talk."

Lord Carruthers joined them later,
and a friendly greeting took place between
them. Then they parted to dress
for dinner.

Adela looked very beautiful as she
entered the drawing-room, with her half-cut
dress-body of black crape and white
lisse, in startling relief against her fair

neck, without an ornament of any sort,
save a bunch of scarlet mountain ash-berries,
which the Countess had pinned
upon her left shoulder.

Lady Limestone was sitting upon the
sofa in earnest conversation with Cecil
Egerton, and Adela had advanced far
into the apartment before she noticed
who her companion was.

When she did so she stopped, and
involuntarily pressed her hand against
her heart to still its wild pulsation,
and would have fled, but for the
Countess's detaining voice.

I am glad to bring old friends together,"
she said, in her pleasant, easy
way. *' You have not met for sometime,"
she asserted.

Pardon me. Miss Thorndyke and
I have met very lately."

Of course. How stupid I am ! Why,
you told me only this afternoon that you

VOL. III. N

and Cecil met at your father's grave when
you and Horace Lake were carrying flowers
there."

Horace Lake ! He remembered the name
at once, and how Scamp had talked of him
up in the old tree, where they had sat together
when she was but a child.

Horace Lake ! " he repeated, with a
strange look. " I had certainly seen the
young man before, but I was unaware who
he was."

The young man ! " laughed the
Countess. " Why, Cecil, one would think
he had come down to measure you for a
new coat, to hear your scornful accents.
Horace Lake is a fine young fellow, and
thoroughly nice, and more  he is as true as
steel. Did you ever meet Lilian Free-mantle
? Well, he has been engaged to
lier ever since they were boy and girl together,
and his constancy was wonderful,
through the roughest weather ; for her

stern parent would not let her see him or
speak to him. But dear Adela stood by
them through thick and thin, and even
managed at last to wheedle Sir Richard,
who was said to be adamant, into forgiving
her. and permitting the engagement.
When are they going to be married,
Adela ? "

In the spring," she answered, in a low
voice.

Well, you can tell Colonel Egerton
the rest, dear, for I must ask you to excuse
me one moment. My son won't
sleep unless I go and kiss him before
dinner," and Lady Limestone was across
the room and out of the door before
either of them could stop her.

Adela, is all this true ? " asked Cecil
Egerton, standing before her, and looking
full into her wonderful, steadfast eyes.

"It is all true," she answered, meeting
his gaze fully.

Then in Heaven's name, why have
we been all these weary years apart ? " he
cried passionately.

Because you had no faith in me," she
replied, with quivering lips ; " and if the
years have been weary ones to you, they
have been equally so to me, Cecil."

Adela, ivhij did you not tell me % " he
continued, with feeling. " See how our
lives have been wasted and spoilt."

I could not tell you. I could not betray
the confidence of others. They trusted
me, Cecil."

And I did not ! " he exclaimed bitterly.

*' No, you did not."

Well, I have been punished for my
fault. My deepest sorrow now, is that
you have suffered too ; but I have learnt
wisdom. I know what you are to me to
the full. Darling, I shall not err again.
Adela, can you forgive me, and will you
take me back '\ "

Then she stretched out both her hands
to him, and he drew her to his breast, and
folded her lovingly in his arms.

We shall never misunderstand each
other again. Scamp," he said softly, as he
stooped and kissed her.

I hope not, Cecil ; I could not bear
much more, and I fear you will find all
the Scamp in me gone  the old name has
well-nigh fallen into disuse now."

It will all come back when you are
happy, dearest, and it shall be my pleasure
to make you so, believe me."

I do," she said gently, looking up at
him with a smile.

Darling, let it be a double wedding.
Rosamond would be very pleased, and I
could take my wife back with me to Malta."

No, Cecil, it could not be so soon. I
should not like to leave my mother at such
short notice. If you want me, you must
wait a little."

Darling, do you really love me still ? "
he asked earnestly.

If I had not loved you still, Cecil,
should I have thrice chosen you ? " she
asked, with a smile. " Is there not the
old leaven of mistrust in your question
? "

Adela, you do not know how I love
you," he said passionately. "It is essential
to my happiness to feel that I am
the one man in the world for you, and
that you could not wed any other."

Cecil, dear ! " she replied softly,
laying her hand upon his confidingly ;
had it been possible that any other
could be aught to me, I should have
married long ago. I have been sorely
tempted, but I could not put aside love
for worldly advantage. If I could have
forgotten you, and our plighted troth, I
should not be free now."

"Thank Heaven that you could not,"

he murmured fervently ; " but, dear one,
when will you make me happy ? "

If you will return with me to Wins-thorpe
we will settle that with mother,"
she said kindly, and the Countess entered
the room with Lord Carruthers.

Eosamond, how shall I ever thank
you ? " said Colonel Egerton, going forward
to meet her. " I see that you planned this
meeting ! "

I did  that is, we did," she laughed,
with a bright confiding glance at Lord
Carruthers. "We thought it so sad that
you and Adela should both be miserable,
when you might be so very happy ; but
we had to go very quietly to work or
we should have scared her away. She
had no idea you were here, till you
met in this room."

And now I want her to marry me at
once, but she says no."

Perhaps she wishes to prove your

faith in her, for the sake of her own
future happiness," said Lady Limestone
wickedly.

She need not be afraid," returned
Cecil ; '' I will never risk losing her again."

Hear, hear ! " laughed the Countess.
*' Adela, dear, do not forget that."

I shall not," replied the girl, in a low
Voice, slipping her hand into that of her
friend, " and I am so happy ! "

The marriage of Lady Limestone and
Lord Carruthers was, as they had decided,
a very quiet one, but at the same time it
was a remarkably pretty affair, for the
vicar of her parish had been anxious todo
her honour, in return for all the cheerful
help she had ever rendered him in his
work ; and the church was decorated with
beautiful white blossoms, and the aisles
were laid with crimson cloth, and from
the churchyard gate to the altar little

children dressed in white, stood with
baskets of flowers, to strew the path of
the bride, while her tenantry had marked
her way with arches of evergreens and
bright bunting.

As a widow she had no bridesmaids ;
but Adela, for once dressed in grey, held
her bouquet and gloves.

The costume of the Countess was
simply exquisite. The tenderest hue of
silver grey satin, richly worked in silver
and seed pearls, with ornaments to match,
\vith tiny ostrich feathers in her hair,
fastened in with pins of silver and pearls,
and a rare old lace veil upon her head,
falling far over her lovely dress behind.

There were no tears at the wedding,
and very few invited guests.

The Duke of St Ives after all gave
away the bride, to set Colonel Egerton at
liberty to be lord Carruthers' best man ;
and the young couple, who, even at their

ages had tasted sorrow as well as joy,
drove back to Limestone to the recherche
breakfast, hand clasped in hand.

Colonel Egerton accompanied Adela to
Winsthorpe, and was warmly welcomed by
Mrs Thorndyke as her future son-in-law.
She had seen her daughter's mental pain
again and again, and longed to alleviate
it, and now it was to be a thing of the past.

If one pang of regret shot through her
heart at the idea of parting with Adela,
and living the rest of her life in solitude,
she did not let her know it.

The news of Miss Thorndyke's engagement
spread quickly through the neighbourhood,
and was heard with vastly different
feelings by her friends.

Horace and Lilian learnt the good news
with unfeigned pleasure, although the
former expressed his wish in confidence
to his future wife that it had been to any

other man, but he found that Colonel
Egerton improved upon acquaintance, and
even that faint regret passed away.

Both he and Lilian considered no one
good enough for Dela, but they grew to
like the man she. had chosen.

Sir Richard smiled sadly when they told
him.

I always knew there must be someone,"
he said. " May she be very, very
happy ; there is no better girl than Adela.
Thorn dyke."

And his mind reverted to that day when
he had taken her to see his treasures, and
had told her of his love.

Bob Lake was not more than human,,
and he told himself bitterly that the last
ray of hope must now be excluded from
his heart, and he determined not to return
to Winsthorpe until Adela's wedding
was over.

It was settled at last that she and
Lilian should be married upon the first
day of spring, and Cecil returned meanwhile
to take the command of his regiment
at Malta, thinking the intervening
months an eternity.

They ran by quickly with Adela  she
had so much to do preparing her trousseau,
and so many things to think
about.

The old troubled look had gradually
passed away from her beautiful face, and
she was daily growing more like the Scamp
of yore.

March came round again, and with
it the wedding-day of both Lilian and
Adela.

For many weeks Sir Richard and Mr
Lake had held long and earnest consultations,
which evidently had afforded the
man of law satisfaction, and on the eve
of the wedding-day Horace and Lilian

were to sign the marriage settlements,
Mrs Thorn dyke and Adela being invited
to be present as witnesses.

That evening was never forgotten by any
of the party assembled.

"Lilian," said her father, with feeling,
I hope the arrangements which I have
made, and which Mr Lake has carried
out for me, will meet with your approval,
and that they will be for the happiness
of both you and Horace. As for you,"
he continued, giving his future son-in-law
a sharp slap on the back, " I have no son
of my own, so you must be one to me.
I can't think of your running away with
Lilian for longer than the honeymoon.
Your future name, my boy, will be Horace
Lake Freemantle, and if interest can get
the old title conferred upon you at my
death, it shall be done ; otherwise it will
lapse at my demise, as there are no male
Freemantles left  I have outlived my race

For the rest, I have divided my property
now, so that I shall have the satisfaction
of knowing that I have made others happier.
For Lilian and Adela, my real
daughter, and my daughter in affection,
I have drawn out deeds of gifts for
thirty thousand pounds each, to render
them independent of their husbands," he
added, pinching Lilian's cheeks. " Five
thousand I have given to Mrs Thorndyke,
to help her keep up the old Eectory, and
thirty thousand to Master Horace, to
render him independent of his wife and
me, upon the understanding that he
takes my name as I have before said,
and makes his home with me at Marsden
Hall."

Oh ! father, how generous you are ! "
cried Lilian ; '* but why rob yourself for
us like this ? "

My dear, I have never lived up to
my income ; it has been accumulating for

years. You may as well have the money.
I have not encroached upon the estate.
That will be the property of Horace and
yourself at my death, and strictly entailed
upon your heirs, male and female,
if you are blessed with them; if not, you
can make a museum of the old place,
and a park for the people ; but I hope
the generations of Freemasons may yet
reside here. And now I don't think I
have any more to say, except that I wish
you all much happiness."

And he looked from Lilian to Horace,
and then let his eyes rest with a kindly
light upon Adela Thorndyke, who advanced
with tears in her own, and clasped his
hand artlessly, while Mrs Thorndyke
took possession of his other hand, and
thanked him with much emotion for his
kindness to her and to her child.

Sir Richard," said Horace, after a
pause, " you have not taken the wind out

of my sails, but you have filled them so
suddenly with fortune's best breezes that
you have fairly overturned my powers
of speech. I am proud indeed to bear
your time-honoured name, and it shall be
mv earnest endeavour never to tarnish
it. Lilian will, I know, rejoice to remain
in her old home. It was, I think, her
one trial in marrying me that she must
leave you and Marsden Hall. For myself,
it is dear to me for her sake and
yours, who have been so good to me ;
and, lastly, thank you for your handsome
gift. Independence is pleasant to all
men, and to most women. I thank you
heartily for all you have so generously
done for us both ; the more so as I expected
nothing from you, for you told
me plainly that those were the terms of
my acceptance as Lilian's suitor."

I never meant it, my boy ; my wish
was to prove the disinterestedness of your

afFection," laughed the baronet ; " so we
will shake hands upon the contract."

The following morning Sir Eichard
tapped early at his daughter's door.

"Are you up, Lilian?" he asked.

"Yes, papa, up and dressed, and alone.
Won't you come in ? "

No, dear ; I want you to come with
me," and he led her to the oratory, and
opened the door.

We must share everything from henceforth,
darling," he said. " I have had a
second key made for you ; it is my wedding
present, Lilian. You will from now,
I hope, be able to realise what your
mother was to me, by the light of your
own love for your husband. This is your
mother's picture m life, and her effigy in
death, my child ! They have been my
best-loved companions. Visit them now
when you like  let them be yours too,"
VOL. III.

and kissing her fondly he left her alone
with her mother's likeness.

Tears rolled slowly down her cheeks.

How very, very lovely ! " she murmured.
" Oh ! mother, if you had only
lived ! What have I not lost in you ! "

Half-an-hour later she returned to her
bedroom, pale, but peaceful and quiet.

The church bells rang out.

It was a gala day for the whole parish,
and the bishop of the diocese was to
marry the two couples, three of whom
were prime favourites in the neighbouring
country side.

The girls were to be dressed alike, inrich
white satin, trimmed with rare old
Spanish point, with veils to match, with
real orange blossoms, and myrtle flowers.

The two carried-es containing; the brides
drove up to the church simultaneously ;
and as the two girls walked up the path
together, one upon her father's arm, and

the other upon her mother's, there was
a hush of admiration from the rustic
croYcl ; and it was impossible to say
which looked the most beautiful ; and
not one of the twelve bridesmaids, who
stood six on either side, and fell in two
and two behind them, as they passed
on, could compete with either for the
palm of beauty.

The organ pealed out as they entered
the church, and on either side the steps
leading to the altar stood the two bridegrooms
awaiting them  handsome, 
men, both of them.

A murmur ran through the church as
they stood side by side.

The words were spoken which were to
insure peace or misery to four lives, and
they walked to the vestry amid outstretched
hands, and a buzz of congratulations.


Then back down the aisle, with their

path strewed with flowers, to the soul-stirring
strain of the Wedding Marchand
home to Marsden Hall to breakfast.

Every one was welcome to the Hall
upon the occasion who liked to come.

It was a red-letter day to rich and
poor, and good cheer was provided in
royal style.

Two carriages stood waitins at the
door soon after, and married life had
really begun for Adela and Lilian, as
they passed out into the uncertain
future, each with her chosen mate, with
every prospect of happiness before her.

Six weeks later, Horace and Lilian were
receiving their visitors at Marsden Hall,
and Adela the adulation of the officers of
her husband's regiment at Malta.

The following Christmas a strange and
unlooked-for change came.

Lady Carruthers had become the mother
of another little boy, and when he was

but a few days old, her bonnie blue-eyed
son died suddenly of croup ; and was
buried long before she was allowed to
hear the sad truth.

Thus Limestone passed away from her,
and became the property of Colonel
Egerton, who was Colonel Egerton no
longer, but Lord Limestone of Limestone.

And Lord Carruthers took his wife to
Warminster Towers, as soon as she was
strong enough to travel, tender as a
woman to her in her sorrow.

The loss of the little Viscount was a
terrible blow to Lady Carruthers ; but
with her husband's arm about her waist
and her baby's plump arms round her
neck, she soon learned to be happy again.
