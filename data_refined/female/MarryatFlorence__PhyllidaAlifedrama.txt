CHAPTER I.

ATE HEAD was a little place
between a village and a town,
situated on the borders of the
Thames, where it joins the Channel waters,
and sufficiently near London to have the
nastiest dregs of its population poured into
it by excursion trains three times a-week
all through what it termed 'the season.'
There had been a time when Gatehead
was strictly dull and proper  when it had

VOL. II. A

possessed no railway station, nor theatre,
nor hotel even of the most unpretentious
order. Then, its residents were composed
of old maids and widows and superannuated
officers, who met daily on its one promenade,
and gabbled of the iniquity of
the Board of Guardians in wishing to pave
the town, or introduce public conveyances,
or give their sanction to the erection of a
railway station at Gatehead. But those
days were past. The old ladies and
gentlemen were sleeping quietly in the
churchyard, and were not likely to have
their ears shocked by the ribald songs of
drunken excursionists, nor their eyes by
the flaming placards, which set forth that
burlesque had found its way even down
to that select retreat. But Gatehead was
hardly improved by the change occasioned
by the march of intellect. In the olden days
it had been at least respectable, If dull.
Now it was dull and disreputable. More
than two-thirds of the houses were let out

in furnished apartments to clerks' and
tradesmen's wives, whose superabundant offspring
occupied the entire beach, and made
the welkin ring with their discordant cries.
The few residents that remained in Gate-head
were in the habit of letting or shutting
up their houses during the warm months
of the year, and resigning the town to a
lower class of inhabitants, returning only
when the winter had commenced, and the
place was empty, muddy, cold, and unutterably
depressing. It will be understood,
therefore, that Gatehead was at no
time a very desirable place to live in.

Phyllida Moss came to it in the noisy,
vulgar, money-making season. All day
long the station kept on disgorging troops
of mechanics and petty traders and their
families, who swarmed about the place
like flies, causing a lively trade in cockles,
winkles, shrimps, tea and bread and butter
likewise, it may be supposed, of beer
and stronger liquors. All the days they

spent with crimsoned faces and perspiring
bodies on the beach or pier. All the
evenings they danced in drunken glee up
and down the principal street, the women
with the men's hats upon their tousled
heads, and vice versa; or drove about Gate-head,
packed into open carriages, a dozen
at a load, sitting on each other's laps,
shouting filthy songs, and presenting altogether
as disgusting and degrading a spectacle
of human nature as could be seen
anywhere. But the letters of lodgings
made their harvest by the drunken crew,
and were compelled to be grateful for their
patronage. When Phyllida arrived at the
station, and (not having apprised Mrs Pen-fold
of her coming) found herself obliged
to elbow her way alone through the boisterous
crowd, her heart sunk, and she almost
wished she had remained in Bluemere.
Her soul was naturally formed to dislike
noise and publicity, and she shuddered at
the Idea of carrying her trouble about with

her amongst such a herd of ruffians. She
had hoped to find quiet and solitude in
Gatehead, but it did not seem probable, and
her thoughts went back longingly to the
shady road to Brick Common, where she
had crazed in the silent mere and heard that
sweet, soothing voice  the sweetest voice
Heaven ever bestowed on man  remonstrating
with her on her unhallowed wish.
There were no cabs, to carry her box or
herself, at Gatehead station that day  they
were all taken up by the excursionists, so
Phyllida hired a porter with a truck, and
walking beside him to Shirland Villas, presented
herself in a very humble fashion at
mrs Penfold's door. Her knock was answered
by a placid - faced woman in a
mourning dress, whom she felt sure at first
sight was Mrs Penfold herself.

Are you my cousin Penfold ? ' she asked
eagerly. * I am Phyllida Moss.'

The lady  for a lady she was in everything,
but perhaps her occupation  dropt

the prim look she wore for a stranger
immediately, and dimpled over with smiles
of greeting.

Are you really ? You don't mean to say
so ? ' she cried, as she kissed the girl on
both cheeks. * Come in, my dear, come
in,' she continued, as she pushed Phyllida
into a little parlour on the ground floor.

Never mind the luggage, Sarah will see
after that. And so you have come to stay
with me at once. That is good of you,
though of course I didn't expect to see
you quite so soon, but your room shall be
ready in half - an - hour. Sit down, dear,
and rest yourself; I am sure you must be
tired,  and now you will have a glass of
wine, won't you ? '

No, no, cousin Penfold ; I never drink
wine. I would rather have a cup of tea.'

And so you shall, dear ; anything that I
have it in my power to give you,' replied the
hospitable Mrs Penfold, and then running to
the head of the stairs, she called out, 'Sarah!

Sarah ! Miss Moss has arrived. Come up at
once and see after her box ; and take the mattress
off the bed in the Httle room, and put it
to the kitchen fire; and air some clean sheets,
and let us have a cup of tea as soon as ever
you can get it ready; and give an eye to
Captain Barclay's cutlets, lest they should
burn ; and don't forget to take an extra halfpenny
worth of milk for Miss Armadale's
coffee.'

And then she returned to the parlour, and
recommenced purring over Phyllida. ' It is
such an unexpected pleasure to get you here,
dear, for you seem such a favourite with
Charlotte. I hardly hoped she would let you
leave Bluemere.'

But I am not very well,' stammered Phyllis,
' and I want change, and since you were
so kind as to ask me, cousin Penfold, and
cousin Pinner consented to my visiting you  '

Say no more about it, my dear. I am
only too glad to see you, and I hope the
change may do you good. Gatehead is nota

fashionable place, but it is very healthy ;
and though I don't pretend to be a ladylike
my sister Charlotte, I can give you as
many comforts, I hope, as she can

But why are you not a lady as much as
herself?' asked Phyllida. *I am sure you
look more so, cousin Penfold, for she is so
fond of gay caps and dresses.'

Well, my dear Phyllida,' said her cousin,
laughing, ' of course we come of the same
parentage, and received the same training.
But poor Mr Penfold was very unfortunate
in business  in fact, it was his heavy losses
broke his heart at last ; and he left me almost
penniless. So I had but the choice of two
things  to live on the charity of my relations,
or to earn my own livelihood, and I chose
the latter.*

And quite right, too, cousin ! Who would
live on charity who was not obliged ?'

So, as I possessed a little furniture,' continued
Mrs Penfold, * I thought the best plan
would be to let furnished apartments. And

really it is far less trouble than you would think.
My two lodgers have been with me now for
more than three years. Captain Barclay, a
retired officer of the Royal Navy, is the
quietest old gentleman you ever saw, and
most simple in his habits ; and though poor
Miss Annadale is rather crotchety at times,
Sarah and I have got used to her ways, and
generally contrive to satisfy her. They pay
me sufficient to keep my house comfortably
and respectably, and that is all I need. So
you see, my dear, I am not so much to be
pitied, as perhaps my sister Charlotte would
like to make out.'

'Cousin Pinner has vulgar stuck-up notions,'
said Phyllida, unreservedly ; ' and the people
she lives amongst encourage her in them.
They are all stuck-up in Bluemere, and they
disliked me because I cannot pretend to be
pious when I am not. Cousin Penfold, I
know I shall like you much better than I did
her. I feel you are not a humbug, and I
think it was that feeling, and the knowledge

that you are not ashamed to work, that made
me decide so suddenly to come to you. I
want to work myself; but I don't know how
to set about It. Will you help me to get my
own living as you do } '

We will talk about that hereafter, Phyllis,'
said Mrs Penfold. 'You must stay with
me for some weeks, and we shall have
plenty of time for discussing ways and
means. Here is Sarah with our tea. Now
you must eat this nice fresh g (I know
it is fresh, because the captain and I keep
a joint poultry yard in the back garden),
and some buttered toast, and you will feel
all the better for it. Bless me ! you are
very like your poor dear mother,' continued
Mrs Penfold as Phyllida removed her
hat ; ' she had just such clear brown
eyes as yours, and the same profusion of
hair. But what have you been doing to
your hair, child } It is quite yellow in
places, and the ends look as if they had
been burnt.'

Phyllida grew scarlet.

I was foolish enough to dye it once,'
she answered ; ' but it will soon be all right
again.'

To dye it ! ' reiterated Mrs Penfold ; ' that
was a silly thing (not but what half the
girls do it now-a-days), only it's a shame to
touch such hair as yours. It's a lovely
colour in itself, and as soft as silk. No,
no, leave the dyeing to the old women,
my dear, and the red-haired ones, and
depend upon it you look much better as
the Lord made you. And how long is it
since you lost your mother ? '

Years ago,' replied Phyllida, with a deep
sigh.

Ah, poor dear ! she was never very
strong as a girl, I remember, though I heard
little of her after she went to St Domingo.
It's such a distance, you know, and foreign
letters cost so much money. But she went
out with her father, who was a West India
merchant, and we heard the report afterwards

of her marriage. And so she married twice
dear, dear, what an undertaking ; and
Mr Moss was your papa. And have you
lost him long, my dear ? '

No, very lately,' said Phyllida, with a
glance at her black dress.

Ah, yes ; of course, thoughtless of me
to ask. And you have been left without
any provision ? '

Utterly so, cousin Penfold. I had only
just enough money to bring me to England,
and keep me till I heard from cousin
Pinner. I should have gone out as a servant
if she had not asked me to Bluemere.'

We must find something better for you
than that,' replied Mrs Penfold, * and till
we do find it, it will be hard if your own
mother's second cousin cannot give her
orphan daughter food and shelter. So
consider yourself at home, my dear, until
you can better yourself by leaving Gate-head.
Think that you are my child. I wish,
indeed, Heaven had given me such a child.

I should never have missed the bit and sup
I earned for her,' and the good creature
fell on Phyllida's neck and embraced her
heartily. And it really seemed as if she
meant what she said. As soon as Captain
Barclay's cutlets and Miss Annadale's coffee
were served, Mrs Penfold invited her cousin
to a ramble through Gatehead.

If you are not too tired, dear, you will
like to see our little town, and Sarah will
attend to the old lady, so I am free. This
is my holiday time,' she said as she and
Phyilida emerged from Shirland Mllas upon
the esplanade, ' when I go to see my friends,
or take a walk with them, or enjoy an
hour at the play. And it freshens me up
for the next dav's work.'

You are not so strict as cousin Pinner,
then ? ' observed Phyilida ; ' she says the
theatre is the devil's playhouse, where he
goes to gloat upon his future victims.'

Does Charlotte say that ? I didn't think
she could be so wicked. No, my dear, I

hope I try to live up to what I believe to
be right, but I should be ashamed to hold
such sentiments as those. I see no harm
in the theatre, and I am very fond of going
there. In fact, when we have a good company
in Gatehead, I go two and three times
a-week. Would you like to go to-night  '
continued Miss Penfold, thinking to please
her visitor. * They play " East Lynn." It
is a pretty piece ; I am sure you will
like it.'

No, no,' replied Phyllida, shrinking backward.


Why, what is this, you seem almost
as shocked as Charlotte herself. Have I
wounded your feelings by the proposal ? '

No, dear cousin Penfold, indeed you
have not, only I do not care for the light
and the heat and the noise. Sometimes I
think I shall never enter a theatre again.
Let us go down to the beach. May we ?
I long to put my hands into that cool green
water, and feel the fresh salt breeze blow

in my face. I shall love to lie for hours
on the beach, if you will not call it wasting
time as cousin Pinner did, and gaze up into
the sky or over the waters and " make
believe," as children say, that Phyllida Moss
died years ago, and I am quite another
girl, who has only heard of her sad life
and pities her for having lived it.'

My dearest Phyllida,' cried the warmhearted
Mrs Penfold, 'this is not the way
in which a young creature like yourself
should view life. It is very sad to lose
our parents, dear ; but in the course of
nature they die before ourselves, and it is
morbid to consider all happiness over for
us because they are gone.'

 Oh, it is not that  it is not that ! '
replied Phyllida, saying-more than she
intended.

'Then I can guess what it is,' said i\Irs
Penfold, looking very wise, ' and it will be
cured before long, my dear, never fear.'

But something in the girl's sorrow-laden

eyes checked any further jesting on her
cousin's part, and she turned the subject
to some less personal matter. The two
women remained out late that warm
summer's night, lingering on the beach and
pier till the harvest moon had risen, and
every ripple on the incoming tide was tipped
with phosphoric light.

Is it not beautiful . ' said Phyllida, as she
leant entranced over the railings of the pier.
I have watched the water all ablaze like
this at St Domingo, until I felt that to drop
to sleep beneath those warm living waves
would be .heaven compared to the life of
cold anxiety and doubt which we pass here.'

But what kind of doubt, my dear ? ' inquired
Mrs Penfold. ' I hope you have
not had your mind upset by some of these
terrible false doctrines that are going about
now-a-days ? '

Not exactly, cousin ; though sometimes
when I have seen how a poor girl like
myself can pass through this world of

temptation without a soul to succour her,
I have doubted if there is anybody to look
after us, or to care If we go to heaven or
the other place ; yet I did not mean religious
doubt, but the difficulty of deciding what Is
best to be done In certain actions of our
lives. Have you ever felt that difficulty,
cousin ? '

Oh yes, my dear, often ! I remember
when Miss Annadale wanted to take my
rooms I had the most harassing doubts on
the subject, which kept me awake for several
nights, because she seemed to have no
friends nor references, and I thought to
myself where on earth was the rent to
come from If she played me false ? However,
she's proved as good a lodger as ever
a woman had, so you see I might have
saved myself the trouble of doubting herat
all.'

But with regard to one's friends,' said
Phyllida wistfully, ' do you think it necessary
to tell them everything one has ever

VOL. II. B

done during one's lifetime, whether It be
right or wrong, so long as we are good
and faithful friends to them ? '

My dear girl, what a question ! No,
most decidedly not ! The world would
come to a pretty pass, indeed, if all our
friends turned into father confessors. Why,
I don't even approve of confessing sins to a
priest, for we were all brought up on strictly
evangelical principles, and I can't bring
myself to fall in with what they call High
Church doctrine. Still, there's some sense
in telling your troubles to a minister if you
fancy he can help you out of them ; but as
for laying one's heart bare to a friend, you
take my advice, dear, and never do such
a thing. Confess your sins to God. He
is the only person who can forgive them,
and so He must be the proper person to
hear them.'

Do you really think so ? ' said Phyllida,
with a strange light in her eyes.

Of course I do ! Why, child, If it Is no

offence, in what religion may your parents
have reared you ? '

In none' replied the girl, in a low
tone.

What a shame ! I can't help saying it,
and I should have thought Agnes might
have remembered the teaching she had at
home better than that comes to.'

Oh, don't blame my mother, my poor
unhappy mother ! ' cried Phyllida hastily.
Cousin Penfold, you don't know what she
suffered before she died. Her life was one
continual misery to her. Is it a wonder that
she grew to disbelieve in a God or an
eternity, or anything except the cruelty and
wickedness of man ? '

Poor, dear Agnes ! Then I suppose your
father didn't treat her well ? '

Don't ask mee about it' replied Phyllida,
with a shudder ; ' don't mention his name
to me, because I cannot bear it. Cousin
Penfold, the first memory I can recall is of
my mother's suffering ! She was my all

whilst she Heed  I cared for no creature
upon earth but herself  and, seeing how
unhappy she was permitted to be, is it
wonderful that I too came to doubt whether
there was any God sitting up in heaven,
or any life when this shall be ended ?'

Oh, you mustn't think like that, my
dear. Brighter times are coming for you
now, I hope, and you must try and believe
that the Almighty is overruling your actions
for you, and will make everything right in
the end. And my advice to you, Phyllida,
is to bury your past as much as lies in
your power. Try not to think of it or
speak, of it. Let it die a natural death, as
all griefs do in time, and begin a new life
from the present.'

It is all past and done with,' said
Phyllida musingly ; ' it can never trouble
me or any one again, thank God, and I
should be only too thankful to let it rest.
And you really think I shall be wise to do
so, cousin Penfold ? '

I think It is your duty to do so,' replied
the elder lady. * And now we had
better go in, Phylllda, for It Is eleven
o'clock, and Captain Barclay will never
allow any one but me to mix his glass of
toddy.'

Can't I take that trouble off your hands,
cousin Penfold,' asked the oflrl, lauehlno- :
you must let me help you, If I can, and I
am famous at mixing all kinds of drinks.'

I think I will dispense with your assistance
in this particular,' replied Mrs Penfold,
laughing also, * or we shall have the old
captain taking to drink for the sake of seeing
you stirring the lemon and whisky together.
You are too pretty for a handmaid, my dear
child, even for such a dried-up and salted

old gentleman as Captain Barclay.'

Phylllda seemed to have dropped a load
off her mind after this walk with her cousin,
for she laughed and talked quite merrily
until it was time to go to bed. But with
solitude the old distressing perplexities returned

to worry her, and Mrs Penfold heard
her moaning through her restless sleep. She
concluded, therefore, that the girl's body
wanted a little petting as well as her mind, and
commenced the cure by Insisting upon treating
her as an Invalid. She made her He In
bed late, and occupy the sofa when she came
downstairs, and fed her with strengthening
broths and jellies, till Phyllida was obliged
to remonstrate against being killed with too
much kindness. And on the evenlncr of the
third day, as she was dressing herself for a
walk, and Mrs Penfold appeared in her
bedroom with a look of mystery upon her
countenance, Phyllida wondered what new
remedy was going to be tried upon her.

Cousin Penfold,' she exclaimed, ' I
cannot take any more soup or jelly today.
I feel filled up to the very throat !
And I see you are bent upon physicking
me. I can read a new remedy written in
your face.' A

'Yes, my dear,' replied Mrs Penfold

seriously, ' I really have a new medicine that
I want you to take. I have been studying
your case, Phyllida, and I believe I have
hit on the proper cure, and I must insist
on your trying it.'

Anything to please you, cousin ! What
is it, food or physic t I hope it is not
very nasty 1 '

It doesn't look nasty,' said Mrs Penfold ;
but I haven't tasted it myself. Any way I
am sure it will do you good. Come down
and see.'

Haven't you got it with you ? '

No ; I left it in the parlour.'

All right ! I will come,' said Phyllida, as
she adjusted her hat. ' You are too good
to me, cousin Penfold,' she added, as she
wound her arm round the old lady's waist.
I should be ungrateful, indeed, to refuse
to try anything you see fit to recommend
to me.'

I recommend this strongly,' replied Mrs
Penfold, as they reached the parlour door.

Go in, my dear, and take it at once ; you
will find it by the side of the table.'

So saying she pushed Phyllida gently into
the parlour, where she saw standing by the
mantelpiece  Bernard Freshfield. Her first
impulse was to turn and fly ; but the door
was closed behind her, and Mrs Penfold was
descending the kitchen stairs.

Oh, Mr Freshfield ! ' she murmured with
crimson cheeks, ' is ihifair ?'

I will answer your question by another,
my Phyllida,' said Bernard, crossing to her
side, * was it fair of you to run away from
me without one word of warning ? '

I thought it best  I did not think you
would be so foolish as to follow me  and
after that day on the Brick Common Road,'
said Phyllida, flushing violently, ' after what
I said to you then, I did not feel as if I
could meet you again.'

After what you said to me on the Brick
Common Road,' he answered, looking full
into her eyes, * you had no longer any right

to think for yourself at all. Why did you
not give yourself to me that day ?  a freewill
offering  and is this the way you make
a present ? To give it one day and take
it away the next. But you are mine,
Phyllida, and you shall not rob me a second
time.'

I thought it best,' she reiterated. ' I
know it is best, that you should forget me,
Bernard ! '

'It is not best, it would be the very
worst ; besides, it is impossible. Phyllida,
I have prayed for years to God to send me
my soul's partner ! Am I to be so ungrateful,
now He has heard my prayer,
as to turn away and take no notice of it ?'

But perhaps you are mistaken,' she faltered
; ' people appear so different from what
they are  you might find out afterwards that
I am not the person you had imagined me
to be ! You know that I am not a good, religious
girl ! How shall I make a proper
parson's wife ? '

I do not know that you are not a good,
religious girl,' he answered, making her sit
down on the sofa by his side ; ' but if it is
the case, I shall marry my wife for myself,
not for my parish, and I shall keep her for
myself into the bargain. I am not on the
look-out for a female curate without stipend.
I want a companion, a friend, a second self!
Such an one I have found in you, Phyllida ;
and only one part of the question remains
to be solved in order to settle it satisfactorily,
and for ever. And that is. Do you
love me ? '

The month is not over yet,' she said,
temporising with her destiny.

I will not wait a month now for your
decision. I cannot ! Had you remained in
Bluemere I would have been patient, but
your sudden unexplained departure made
me so miserable, that I came away at a
moment's notice, and do not intend to return
home again without my wife.'

Oh, Bernard, that would be far too

sudden she cried. ' Think what a solemn
thing marriage is. Once done, It can
never be undone,' and there Phyllida pulled
herself up suddenly and was silent.

What Is the matter, my darling ? ' Inquired
Bernard tenderly ; ' did anything
frighten you ? I know all you would say,
Phyllida, and agree with It heartily. No
one thinks marriage a more solemn sacrament
than I do  a true marriage that is 
one hallowed by God and approved by
man, as ours will be.'

The girl shivered slightly, and pressed
closer to him. Freshfield Interpreted the
act as a sign of compliance, and joyfully
returned the pressure.

To prove to you the solemnity with
which I regard marriage, Phyllida, I will
repose In you a little confidence. I will
treat you as If you were already the beloved
partner of all my anxieties, and you
shall tell me If I have done right. Amongst
my parishioners I have a man and his wife.

as handsome and apparently as happy a
couple as you could see. The husband
especially Is devoted to his wife and her
children, and can see no fault in them.
Some months ago the woman was taken
dangerously 111  In fact, our doctor gave no
hopes of her, and she sent for me. I
found the husband almost heartbroken in
the lower room. He could not speak for
sobbing. All he could do was to point to
the upper chamber where his wife lay dying.
I went upstairs and found her in a state
of great excitement. She knew she was
given over, and she wished to speak to me
before she died. What was my horror on
receiving her confession to learn that for
years past she had been habitually unfaithful
to her husband, and that she was not
even sure which of her children belonged
to him. However, the unhappy woman
was apparently fast passing away, and my
duty was to soothe her last pains, by pointing
her to the one source of forgiveness

for all sin. I left her, as I thought, for ever
in this world. What was my astonishment
the next day to hear that her disorder
had taken a most unexpected turn in
the night, and she was in a fair road to
recovery. In a few weeks I heard that
she was up and about her domestic work
again, as bright and beautiful as before ;
and her husband adoring her more than
ever, for having been restored to him, as
it were, from the very jaws of death. Now
came my difficulty, Phyllida ! I had received
the wife's confidence under the seal
of confession, and although I have no High
Church proclivities, I am a man of honour,
and I consider that such a disclosure made
at such a moment should be held as sacred
as though it had never been revealed. And
yet when I saw the woman as careless and
unsubdued as she had ever been, and thought
of the unfortunate man she was, in all probability,
continuing to deceive, I wondered
where my duty lay, and whether I could

conscientiously permit him to live on, duped
and betrayed, when It was In my power to
open his eyes.

I cannot tell you how long this matter
puzzled me ; for how long I thought over
it and adjusted Its pros and cons, and
prayed to be guided to act aright. And
to what conclusion do you suppose that I
arrived ? '

I cannot tell,' said the girl half sobbing ;
tell me yourself, Bernard, I want to
know

Don't tremble so, my darling  the story
has a tolerable ending. How I argued
the matter out was thus : To tell the man
the truth (always supposing I could have
reconciled it with my conscience) would
have marred his life, and could not have
amended hers. It would have broken up
a happy home, the influence of which maybe
the means Intended by God to lead
her Into the right way at last. It would
have cast the man, blaspheming Heaven,

perhaps, for his disappointment, upon the
world, and turned his love for her offspring
into jealousy and hate.

I saw no end to the miseries my breach
of confidence might entail on the couple
and their children ; and I saw no especial
duty to urge me to it.

The fact that the wife had outraged
the sanctity of marriage only affected herself
; it could not undo that sanctity which
the husband had faithfully observed. And
so I left them to themselves and the mercy
of God, who can bring hidden things to
light if He so chooses without our intervention.
Was I rlorht or wrote ? '

Oh, you are right  always right and
always good,' said Phyllida clinging to
him ; ' and if I thought  if I were really
sure that you believe as you say, that a
marriage of love is a sacrament ordained
of Heaven that none of the lesser circumstances
of life should be permitted to outweigh
 '

If you were really sure of that, love,
what would you do ? ' whispered Bernard.

I would marry you tomorrow, and feel
myself  oh, so blest, to be your wife. ! '

Done with you ! ' cried our unorthodox
parson, as he smothered her with kisses.
You have passed your word, Phyllida,
and you shall not retract it. We will be
married tomorrow ! '

TilHEX Phylllda had thus stepped
over the boundary that divided
hesitation from consent, she
found there was no retraction for her. Bernard
had made Mrs Penfold acquainted with
his errand before he had seen Phyllida,
and she was naturally all on his side. That
her young orphan cousin should hesitate
for a moment to accept a man, young,
good-looking, a clergyman, and with two
thousand a-year, appeared incredible to
her ; and when Bernard called her in to
take part in the general council, she treated
all Phyllida's objections as mere affectation.

VOL. II. c

r .

The girl wished Bernard to consent to her
remaining a month or two at Gatehead
whilst he prepared the minds of his mother
and sister and the parish generally for
their marriage, and Freshfield wanted the
ceremony to take place there and then, in
fact he vowed he would not return to
Bluemere without her.

But it would be shocking  indelicate,'
urged Phyllida, * for you to marry without
giving them any notice ; what would they
say ? A clergyman's wedding is generally
such a thoroughly parochial affair.'

And would you like it to be so, Phyllida ?
Would you like to go to church in Blue-mere
with every old woman in the parish
gazing at you and picking holes in your
dress or your bonnet ? '

Oh no ; you know I should not. I
shall shrink from the scrutiny of the old
women more than anything. I don't think
I could go through with it, without you
by my side. Only I am nobody, you see ;

but for your own sake, Bernard, and for
Mrs Freshfield's, ought you not to endure
the miseries of a public wedding ? '

The young man looked thoughtful.

There is something in your argument,
Phyllida, and it proceeds from a good and
pure motive, as all your proposals do. But
I think I can overcome It without infringing
my duty. In the first place, nothing would
persuade me to take part in an ordinary
wedding feast again. I did It once. I
swore before heaven to love and honour
a woman whom I hardly loved, and was
not all sure I could honour, and I sat
through the public breakfast that succeeded
it, feeling like a criminal escaped
from justice. We wont have anything
of that sort again. This will be a very
different wedding, my love, from the other
it must be celebrated in a* different way.'

But oh, Bernard,' cried Phyllida, hiding
her face against his shoulder, ' if she came so
short of what you desired, what shall / do ? '

6 Phyllida.

You will do as I tell you ? ' said the
young man fondly. ' You will marry mein
Gatehead in the course of the next few-days,
and let the astonishment and the
cackle of Bluemere subside before we show
our faces there again ? Mrs Penfold, come
and plead my cause with this obstinate
girl ! You are, I believe, her nearest relation
in England  give your sanction to
my plan, and make Phyllida hear reason.'

Indeed, Mr Freshfield, I see no cause
whatever why you should not have your
own way. If you were a young boy, or a
private gentleman, or one of those nasty
soldiers that run about making love to
every woman they meet, why, I might say
it would be better to wait, and see whether
you didn't change your mind. But Phyllida
mustn't forget that you are her minister as
well as her lover, and that she is in a
measure bound to follow your precepts, and
certainly not responsible for acting wrong
whilst under your direction.'

Capitally put, Mrs Penfold. You area
first-rate advocate. Do you hear that,
Phyllida ? I am not going to ask you anymore
 I am going to order you. And
your cousin says you are bound to obey.'

I see that between the two of you I
am not likely to get my own way,' replied
Phyllida, smiling.

Of course not, when it is a bad way.
Listen to me, dear ; this is what I propose.
Let us get a licence, and be married as
privately as possible in the church here.
Then I will take you to Switzerland or to
Paris, or anywhere you most fancy, and
thence I will write and let my people hear
the truth. Remember, Phyllida, that, as
Mrs Penfold says, I am not a boy, and
responsible to no one for my actions ; and
I have often told my mother that if I
married again it should be as private a
proceeding as the conduct of any other
sacrament. Will you consent to this,
dearest ? Will you come alone with me

and Mrs Penfold some morning, and take
the vows that will bind us together for
life ? '

I will do anything you wish me to do,'
replied Phyllida. ' Henceforward, I am
yours only to command.'

May my orders never be more than the
fulfilment of your own wishes,' said Bernard,
embracing her ; and then he rose
and went to his hotel to dinner, and left
the two women in a flutter of excitement
at the unexpected turn events had taken.

I knew there was a gentleman in the
case,' cried Mrs Penfold, as she half
smothered Phyllida in her excess of congratulations.
* I could read the sirens in
your eyes, and guessed at once you had
had a disappointment in love. But, bless
you, my child, what made you give the
poor fellow the trouble of following you all
the way to Gatehead ? Though I daresay
it will turn out for the best in the end ; for a
private wedding, in my opinion, is far more

agreeable than a public one, and no one
can blame Mr Freshfield for wishing" to
keep it holy ; but why you didn't accept
such a charming, well-mannered young man
on the spot I can't imagine. And with a
couple of thousand a-year of his own, too,
and more comines in at his mother's death.
Phyllida, my dear, you must have been crazy! '

I only asked for a month to decide in,'
said the girl. ' I suppose I always knew
I should accept him (in the end), but I
never thought of his money, cousin Pen-fold,
nor even of his appearance ! He is so
earnest and so right thinking that I  I feel
he is far too good for me.'

Ah, well, my dear, that's a very proper
feeling for a wife to begin her married life
with ; but you'll find it wear off in time.
I remember when Mr Penfold first proposed
to me, I fancied I should never be able
to look to his dinners and the getting up
of his shirts as he had been used to have
them, but I found it all came easy enough

when 1 was once mistress of his house.
And so will you  and you'll make a first-rate
parson's wife, take my word for it.
But fancy your being married from my
poor little place in Gatehead, instead of
Charlotte's fine cottage orde in Bluemere.
Wont she be mad when she hears of it ? '

She will, indeed,' cried Phyllida, with
sudden glee. * They'll be mad all round !
For, do you know, cousin Penfold, they
thought me so wicked in Bluemere, because
I didn't go to church, that the other ladies
looked at me as if I were a strange animal,
and cousin Pinner Invited the parson to
come and convert me ! '

And he has converted you, my dear,
there's no doubt of that ! ' exclaimed the
elder lady ; ' but, Phyllida, I hope It Is
not true that you don't like going to
church, because that weill look very bad
In a parson's wife, and, I feel sure, will bea
cause of annoyance to Mr Freshfield.'

Oh, cousin Penfold, do you think I

would annoy him ? ' asked the girl, v/Ith
her soft eyes full of tears. ' No, not for
worlds ; and of course I shall go to church
when he does, for the pleasure of looking
at him.'

I am not sure that that Is a rIo;ht
motive for attending divine worship, my
dear,' commenced Mrs Penfold primly ; but
Phylllda shut her mouth with a kiss.

Don't talk like that, please. You do
look so like cousin Pinner when you say
such things. I know It's all true and right,
and that / am In the wronor not to think
just the same, only I don't, you know, and
so it reminds me of my own wickedness
and makes me unhappy. Let us talk about
my clothes instead. They will need a lot
of consultation, for, do you know, cousin
Penfold, I have only about eight pounds left,
and I know that will buy very little. So I
must just get a nice dress to be married In,
and let the rest go.'

My dear, that is very awkward,' said Miss

Penfold, looking puzzled ; * I never thought of
it ; but you cannot be married without some
new clothes  it is impossible'"

That is nonsense, cousin. If I am to be
married at all, I must be married as I am,
because I have no more money.'

We must find ways and means, Phyllida.
It is not much I can give you, but still I have
a few pounds in the Savings Bank, and
Charlotte ought, I am sure, to contribute a
liberal sum towards your trousseau.'

Cousin Penfold, of what are you thinking ?
Do you imagine I would be so mean as to
touch a halfpenny of the little provision you
have put by for yourself, and after you so
generously received me in your house ? No,
indeed ! I would starve first ! Neither would
I accept anything from cousin Pinner. She
does not love me, and I would not lay myself
under an obligation to her.'

But, my child, what are you to do 1 Someone
must provide you with such things. Mr
Freshfield was thoughtful enough to give me ,

a hint on the subject himself, and tell me to
make what use of his purse I chose ; but,
perhaps you are too proud to owe it to him,
either.'

I am too proud to owe it to any one,'
replied the girl. ' If Bernard insists upon
marrying me, as King Cophetua did the
beggar maid, he must marry me in rags. I
will buy a nice travelling dress and hat with
my money, that I may not disgrace him outwardly,
and for the rest I will wait till I have
the right to accept his bounty.'

Mrs Penfold was unable to make Phyllida
change her mind, so the simple wardrobe
with which she travelled to Gatehead was
repacked, to be ready to accompany her on
her wedding tour.

Bernard Freshfield was a very fond and
happy lover during those few days of waiting,
and as Phyllida sat with him on the beach, or
strolled along the glowworm lighted cliffs,
and listened to the outpourings of his pure
and high-toned mind, she felt sometimes

terribly afraid, and sometimes deliciously
happy, to think that her life would be so soon
inextricably mingled with his own.

Mrs Penfold trusted her to order the dress
In which she was to be married and leave
Gatehead with her husband, but was horrified
on Its being sent home to find that it
was made of some black material.

My dear,' she exclaimed, ' you can never
wear this !'

Why not ?' demanded Phyllida, with wide
open eyes.

Black, my dear ! black at a wedding.
Why, It's the most unlucky thing in the
world, and will bring death to all your
hopes of happiness.'

Phyllida's face grew pallid as a lily, whilst
her eyes blazed with a sudden premonition
of ill.

Take It away she cried hysterically ;
'burn It, do anything you like with the
horrid thing. I would sooner be married
now In one of Sarah's print frocks.'

But Bernard was close at hand to soothe
and quiet her.

Please, Mrs Penfold,' he said, ' don't put
such silly ideas In my little girl's head.
Do you know that If I have contempt for
one thing above another, it Is for superstition.
How can a colour possibly affect
our life's happiness ? It depends solely on
ourselves and the goodness of God ! If
Phyllida wishes to please me, she will wear
this dress at our marriage if only to prove
that she Is above such foolish fancies.'

You are quite, quite sure, Bernard, that
there is nothing in It ? ' demanded Phyllida,
still trembling.

Quite, quite sure my darling,' he repeated,
as he drew her to him, and Phyllida
wore the sombre dress on the day of her
wedding as he had desired her to do. But
Mrs Penfold's fears were not to be so easily
allayed.

I wouldn't have had it happen for a five-pound
note,' she confided to Sarah In the

kitchen ; ' however, he wishes It, and he's a
clergyman, so of course one's mouth is
stopped. But I shall never feel so comfortable
about this marriage as I did, and  
you mark my words, Sarah  misfortune will
come upon them in one shape or another
before many months have gone over their
heads.'

However, they were married one morning
as early as custom would permit, and
walked straight from the church to the railway
station, looking as happy as if they
were driving off In a carriage and four,
pursued by old slippers and showers of rice.
Phyllida still voted for the country and
quiet, vice the bustle and sights of town,
therefore her husband carried her off to
Lynton, in Devonshire, where they could
enjoy the beauties of nature and each other's
society to their heart's content.

And Mrs Penfold, notwithstanding the
handsome presents which Bernard gave her
in return for her kindness to Phyllida, felt

very lonely when the beautiful face that had
brightened her home for ten short days was
gone again, and almost wished the parson
had never found his way to Gatehead.
Meanwhile things were rather dull in Blue-mere.
Miss Janet Muckheep was quite as
annoyed as Mrs Freshfield at the sudden
disappearance of her son, and notwithstanding
the absence of all ' carnal procleevities '
in her composition, exhibited decided ill-temper
at the derangement of her plans.

'Hoot, Mrs Fraichfield ! ' she ejaculated;
sin your minister sonne ha' sic ill manners
as to bide wa' fra Breear-wud whiles
we stay at Blue Mount, it's time that Bella
and I gang or ways to Barrick-gallagas.'

But why should my son's absence shorten
your stay, dear Miss Janet, when you know
how honoured I feel by your visit here ?
I do not know but what Bernard will soon
return. He is only gone to the sea-side fora
little change. I think the dear boy maybe
suffering from suspense and anxiety on

a certain subject,' said Mrs Freshfield, with
a meaning glance at the inanimate Bella,
and has left home to collect his thoughts
a little. He may have conceived hopes
which he fears may not be realised.'

'Ay,' said Miss Janet, 'but it's no the
way to ken a lassie's mind to rin wa' fra
the carry sight of her. And I steel say,
we ha' better be moving' homewards, Mrs
Fraichfield. Blue Mount is na the onely
loose wha the doors stan' open to receive
the sister and daughter of the Laird o'
Muckheep ; nor your meenester son the
onely carle who'll be proud to mix his
fluid wi' that of the kings o' Scotland.
And so we'll be leaving' you the morrow,
an' sic Mr Fraichfield ha' a mind to the
daughter o' the Muckheeps, he maun find
his ain way to Barrick-gallagas Carse.'

 So foolish of your brother,' moaned
Mrs Freshfield in confidence to Laura, as
the carriage which conveyed the Muck-keeps
to Westertown rolled down the

avenue ; ' and such a chance to miss ! I
am sure Miss Janet was inclined to look
favourably on his suit, and that sweet girl
has been trained to obey her aunt in all
things. If Bernard had but remained and
paid Bella a little attention, they would
have been engaged before they parted

I'm very glad he didn't,' replied Laura
bluntly. ' Mamma, how cii you wish for
such a thing ? To see Berne married to
that red-cheeked booby of a girl. Why,
her accent alone is enough \o set one's
teeth on edge. I'm sure I hope my
brother has better taste. I know if he
married Bella Muckheep / would never set
foot in Briarwood.*

Laura, I am surprised at you, after all
my teaching and exhortation and care !
How can you speak of a dear, Christian
girl in such terms, and one with the oldest
blood in Scotland running in her veins } Do
you know that the lairds o' Muckheep rank
as princes of the soil in their native country?'

VOL. II. D

Soiled princes,' laughed Laura, irreverently
; * well, mamma, If the oldest blood In
Scotland was to be recognised by Its colour,
I might be able to judge of Its purity by
the purple bloom on Bella's cheeks. Her
complexion after dinner was just like pickled
cabbage. But I must be content to accept
the truth on your authority. Any way, I
don't want to see it mixed .with ours. A
troop of little Belles at the rectory would
be "quite too awfully awful"'

If you are going to take refuge in slang,
Laura,' replied Mrs Freshfield loftily, ' we
will drop the subject. But I must say this
is not the way in which I expected my
children to receive my most honoured guests.
My son leaves Bluemere without even bidding
them farewell, and my daughter ' 
witheringly  'my daughter ridicules to my
face the most virtuous and religious young
lady I ever had the privilege of meeting ! '

Oh, I know nothing against her virtue
or her religion,' laughed Laura, ' although

for aught I saw of either of them she might
as well have had none. To me, Bella Muck-keep
is simply a very stupid young woman,
who has been rendered more so than was
natural, by never having been allowed to
exercise her own faculties. However, as
you say, mamma, pray let us change the
subject, for we shall never agree upon it.
Isn't it strange that we have not heard again
from Berne. It is nearly a fortnight now
since he went away. I wonder if he is
still at that place  what was it ?  Gatehead,
from which he first wrote.'

I don't know, my dear, I am sure. Your
brother has not condescended to make me
the confidante of his proceedings.'

Berne always hated letter - writing,
mamma ; but I think we must hear from
him again soon. Ah, there Is the old postman
coming up the avenue. Three to one
that he .brings the letter we want. I will go
and meet him.' And away flew Laura down
the carriage drive, with bounding steps, like.

So''-'"'

a girl let loose from school. Mrs Freshfield
looked after her with pride, and yet she
sighed. She really loved these bright outspoken,
honest children, which she had
brought into the world, but her own training
had been so conventional, that she was
unable to reconcile their mirth, and apparently
light treatment of serious subjects,
with any deeper feeling. The religion she
had been brought up in was like Miss Janet's
a religion of darkness and devils and hell.
she had but the poorest conception of the
goodness and love of the Almighty, and
believed that He sat in judgment over the
world, for the simple purpose of trying how
many unfortunate mortals he could catch
tripping, and condemn to eternal pains. A
religion of brightness and beauty, and a
Father's watchful love, such as Bernard held,
she shook her head at, as an over confidence
not far removed from actual sin. And,
as for Laura, she could not believe but that
the unfortunate girl was utterly unregenerate.

and would remain so, until reclaimed by
some fearful loss or bodily suffering. INIrs
Freshfields was truly a religion and nothing
more. A certain course of action strictly
adhered to, for fear of eternal damnation, but
as for the faith that Bernard had in God 
the faith that if his human wisdom led him
wrong, he had a Father who could make
allowance for the defects in His own creation,
of that his mother knew nothing,
and so she was a most unhappy Christian,
who went moan in 2: through this world in
anticipation of the torments of the next.

Laura came bounding up the drive again,
holding a letter above her head, in token
that her hopes had been realised.

Here it is, mamma,' she cried, as she came
up to the old lady. ' I knew there would bea
letter from Berne to-day. And the postmark
is Lynton. He has got down to Devon.
I thought he would soon tire of the sea-side at
this season. There must be too many " Bobs
and 'Army's " there just now to suit his taste.'

She thrust the letter into her mother's lap
as she spoke.

Be quick and read it, mamma ! I am
dying to hear what our boy is about.'

Mrs Freshfield broke open the envelope,
and commenced to peruse her son's epistle.
She read part of the first page, and then she
turned to the second and third in an aimless
sort of way, and, leaving them, began again
at the beginning, whilst her face twitched,
and she bit her lip and changed all sorts of
colours. Laura, who was watching her
earnestly, grew quite alarmed.

Mamma ! mamma ! what is the matter ? '
she asked quickly.

Mrs Freshfield's answer was to drop the
letter in her lap and begin to cry. The
tears of the young are of little consequence ;
they come and go like a storm in summer,
but it is a terrible thing to see an old person
cry. Laura dropped on her knees by her
mother's side.

Darling ! ' she exclaimed affectionately.

'what can affect you In this manner? Is
Bernle ill or unhappy, or in any difficulty ?
Oh, mother dear ! you can't think what I
am suffering. Don't keep me in suspense ! '

Read ! read ! ' ejaculated Mrs Freshfield,
pointing to the letter. Laura seized it instantly.


Am I to read it aloud, mamma ? '

Yes I I must learn to bear it. Read me
what your misguided brother says.'
And Laura began, 

Queen's Hotel, Lynton.

My dearest Mother,  I have something
to tell you that I fear may startle 
though I trust it may not grieve you. And
let me premise what a dear good mother you
have ever been to me, and how much I love
and reverence you in return. Don't think
that I ever lose sight of your happiness in
any action of my life ; but then I have such
a strong belief that my happiness must
necessarily be yours also.'

Mother, dear, what Is there to make
you cry in this ? ' demanded Laura, stopping
short In her perusal of the letter. ' Berne
writes as he always does to you, in the
most loving and dutiful strain, like the very
best of sons, as he has ever been.'

Go on  read what he tells me,' replied
Mrs Freshfield, In a tone of despair.

You have often expressed a wish that
I should marry again, and I have felt
myself great need of the comfort and rest
that a happy marriage can alone afford a
man in my position. What will you say
when I tell you that I have taken a wife ?
Your first feeling will be, perhaps, a rather
natural annoyance that I did not previously
consult you, and that I should have married
away from Bluemere  '

Married! ' cried Laura, dropping the
letter again, 'really and actually married!
Oh, my dear, dear Berne, how I do hope
he will be truly happy at last.'

I am afraid there is little chance of that
Laura,' said her mother solemnly, ' an union
entered into without the blessing of either
parents or friends can never be a really
happy one.'

I think my brother believes that the
blessing of God is all that is actually necessary,'
replied her daughter, ' and he has
that, I am sure. And why should he not
have ours as well ? '

Will you be good enough to proceed
with Bernard's letter ? ' said Mrs Fresh-field,
who, having nothing to say in refutation
of Laura's last remark, considered it
advisable to return to the grievance in
hand. ' I confess I should like to know
wJio it is that has seduced your brother
to forget his duty.'

Oh, to be sure ; who can it be  ' exclaimed
Laura curiously, ' let me see 
where was I ? Oh, here.'

That I should have married away from

Bluemere, but I had my own reasons
for acting as I have done. To consult
you in the matter when you had formed
such different projects concerning me,
would have been simply to raise a discussion
which might have produced ill
feeling between us, and with regard to
Bluemere I had long determined that I
would never assail undergo the horrors
of a formal wedding amongst my parishioners.
Added to this, I made up my
mind to marry Phyllida Moss  '

Who ?' cried Mrs Freshfield with horror.

Mamma ! mamma ! don't look like that 
you frighten me. Yes ; it really is Phyllida
Moss, the girl who came to Briarv/ood with
Mrs Pinner. I heard she had left the
village a few days before Bernard. It
must have been a concerted plan between
them, and  good gracious me, mamma, he
has only known her about three weeks ! '

Get me my bonnet and shawl and order

round the pony chaise,' exclaimed ]airs
Freshfield indignantly ; ' this is some doing
of that wicked woman Mrs Pinner, and
I will eo and tell her so to her face.
She always had a sly catty look to me.'

Pray, mamma, don't do any such thing.
You are not in a fit state to discuss this
matter with any stranger, besides, we don't
know that Mrs Pinner is even aware of
the event. I met her yesterday, and she
said her cousin was staying with her sister.
Listen to the rest of the letter, mamma.
It may contain some consolation.'

'Phyllida Moss!' ejaculated ]airs Fresh-field,
' a girl of whom we know nothing,
who may be a heathen or a Mahometan.
Why, I heard your brother himself call
her a barbarian.'

Oh, that was intended as a compliment,
mamma. I saw Berne admired her the day
we met at Briarwood. And she is very
lovely  you will allow that  you said yourself
you had never seen such a pair of eyes.'

Beauty is vain, Laura, and a fine pair
of eyes will not give us admittance into
heaven. My poor, misguided son ! Led
away by one of the daughters of Heth
to take part in a disgraceful elopement.'

Hardly that, mamma. You must not
forget that Berne was twenty - eight
last birthday, and has no occasion to
elope with any one. But shall I finish
the letter ? '

Yes, yes, go on. I may as well hear
the miserable story to the end.'

Added to this, I made up my mind
to marry Phyllida Moss rather suddenly,
and I could hardly expect those who
do not know her as I do, to enter into
the feelings which caused my resolution.
I am not going to expose myself to your
ridicule by indulging in a lovers rhapsody
upon the merits of my young wife ; but
you have seen her face, and it is but an
index to her mind. Phyllida is pure and

innocent as a child, and entirely devoted
to me.

I look forward to a life of complete
contentment in her society, and feel for
the first time that a dual existence can be
truly one. I do not wish to remain away
longer than is necessary, and hope to
take my wife home to Briar wood next
week. Let me have a line to say that
she will find a mother and sister to welcome
her to Blue ]\Iount, and I shall be
entirely happy.  Ever, dearest mother,
your dutiful son,

Bernard Freshfield.'

You will send him that, mother, will you
not ?' cried Laura eagerly, as she finished
the letter. * You will write to dear Berne,
and tell him that all we can do to increase
the happiness of his married life is his without
the asking. And, for my own part, I feel
we shall like her,' continued the warm-hearted
girl. ' I took such a fancy to her sweet, sad

face that day at Briarwood ; and there was
something In her, I can hardly tell what it
was, but very different from other girls of her
age  as if she had passed through some great
experience that made her look down upon idle
chatter and gossip and games. That is the
right sort of wife for our Berne, for he hates
the ordinary type of young lady. ' Don't you
think we shall love Phyllida, mamma 1 . We
must, you know, for Berne's sake.'

We will try to do so, my dear, at all
events,' replied Mrs Freshfield ; ' but whether
she will prove worthy of our affection is an
unanswerable question. If your brother
chooses to marry a girl he has only known
for a month, he must take the consequences.
But I will never forgive Mrs Pinner for
having kept us in ignorance of what was
about to happen.'

And, notwithstanding all her daughter's
efforts to prevent her, the old lady insisted.
upon being driven in state to Mrs Pinner's
cottage, as soon as ever the carriage returned.

o

from Westertown. She found that lady In a
very gay and festive cap, streaming with lilac
ribbons, and a shawl woven of many colours,
like Joseph's coat, upon her shoulders.
poring over a cheerful publication, entitled
The Opening of the Sixth Seal, or the
Final State of the Wicked.' She came
forward with alacrity to welcome her visitor,
but }Irs Freshfield loftily waved aside her
proffered hand.

I see that you have put on your wedding
finery to receive me, Mrs Pinner,' the lady
of Blue Mount commenced with icy dignity ;
but I should have considered it more decent
and suitable to the occasion. If you had
appeared in a garb of mourning.'

Poor Mrs Pinner, to whom this address
was as intelligible as if it had been delivered
in Arabic, could only gasp in answer, ' I
really do not understand you, sirs Fresh-field.'


Not understand me !' exclaimed her visitor.
' Oh, do not add duplicity to your concealment,

Mrs Pinner. You must have
known the preconceived purpose for which
your niece (or whatever she is) left Blue-mere.'


My niece  do you mean my cousin Phyllis
Moss ? She is staying with my sister
Maria at Gatehead.'

And do you mean to tell me that Phyllida
Moss has not written to you, nor your sister
Maria, nor my son, nor anybody ?'

Written to me ! Why ? On what
subject ? Mrs Freshfield, what can you
mean ? I have heard nothing from
Gatehead for the last fortnight.'

Then, if I am to believe you, Mrs
Pinner, you have been as wilfully kept
in ignorance as myself, and this misfortune
must have been brought about through
the machinations of your unprincipled sister
at Gatehead.'

Oh dear ! oh dear ! What has she
done ? ' cried Mrs Pinner piteously.

Done ? She has just done this. She

has married your cousin Phyllida Moss,
to my son, the rector of Bluemere.'

The final state of the wicked went down
to the around with a crash.

'What!' ejaculated Mrs Pinner, in earpiercing
tones.

'You may well ask what?' replied Mrs
Freshfield, sinking into a chair. ' I have
just received a letter from my son, dated
from Devonshire, where he is staying with
your cousin, and they have been married
for a fortnight.'

Oh ! that wicked, wicked girl ! ' cried Mrs
Pinner, tumbling into another chair. * I
might have guessed what would come of
her never going to church, or reading the
Scriptures, and all her other heathen, godless
ways. And my sister, too, to dare to
consent to such a clandestine proceeding.
I always said that Maria was most carnally
minded, and needed the rod of
divine love to bruise her hard heart, before
she could take her stand with the elect.'

VOL. II. E

And yet you confided Miss Moss to the
care of so worldly a person,' said Mrs
Freshfield sharply.

Dear Mrs Freshfield ! What could I
do ? The girl was her own mistress, and
insisted upon leaving me ! The ways of
grace did not suit her  she sighed for the
leeks and garlic of Egypt, and her example
was not edifying to the young creatures that
come to my house. But little did I guess
the purpose that was in her mind. Married
to Mr Freshfield ! the wife of our
esteemed and reverend minister ! He to
whom we all look up as to an oracle,
married to Phyllida Moss ! Oh, it is
quite incredible ! Like some fearful dream.'

If it appears so incredible to you, you
may fancy what it does to me, Mrs Pinner !
I shall not easily get over the shock I
received this morning. My son is of
course his own master, and should be
able to decide for himself In such matters ;
but I cannot but believe that In this

instance his eyes have been blinded and
his judgment led astray.'

Led astray ! I should indeed say so,
and by that artful, designing girl to. What
will the parish say ? and poor dear Miss
Warren, it will go near to break her heart.
She positively dotes so upon the minister.
And to think that Phyllida Moss is to bethe
mistress of Briarwood ! It is too,
too dreadful ! It would serve her right
if all Bluemere were to cut her. But you
must absolve me from all complicity in
this dreadful affair. I stood guarantee
for neither her moral nor religious training.
I told our dear minister plainly what
a heathen she was, and that no words nor
exhortations of mine made any impression
upon her ! Oh, she is the most
ungodly creature, Mrs Freshfield ; careless
and irreverent to a degree ! It is shocking
to think of her \i2Mm presumed to accept
so exalted a position as that of your
daughter-in-law and your son's wife.'

But Mrs Pinner had gone far enough in
Mrs Freshfield's opinion, and at this juncture
she pulled her up sharply. It had
suddenly occurred to the rector's mother
that it was slightly undignified for her to
sit and listen to abuse of a girl who (whatever
her faults might be) was indissolubly
the wife of her son.

'There, there, Mrs Pinner, I think that
is sufficient, you never said a word about
this to me before, and I daresay your imagination
is running away with you now. If
you had no hand in planning this marriage,
the least said about it the better; and if
you take my advice, you will not repeat
what you have said to me to your neighbours.
My son is very determined, you
know, and it may make things unpleasant
in Bluemere, if it comes to his ears that
his wife's character has been discussed in
this familiar way amongst his parishioners.
He intends to bring Mrs Bernard Fresh-field
home to Brairwood next week, and

it behoves us all to receive her in a manner
befitting our minister's choice. Whether
it will prove a happy marriage for him is
quite another thing, but I am sure he will
be quick to resent the least affront offered
to his wife.'

Mrs Pinner was sharp enough to take
the cue.

Of course, dear Mrs Freshfield, and I
should never d7'ea7n of mentioning what I
did to any one but yourself, and especially
when every girl in Bluemere has been setting
her cap at the minister for the last
two years. I am naturally very proud
to think his choice should have fallen on
my little cousin, who (notwithstanding a
wayward disposition) has many excellent
qualities, which will, doubtless, under dear
Mr Freshfield's training, render her in time
all that could be desired as a minister's
wife.'

But Mrs Freshfield was not to be taken
in by this sudden change of opinion. She

gave Mrs Pinner some supplementary cautions,
and then returned to Laura's presence,
metaphorically wringing her hands.

A nice thing your brother has done,'
she commenced complainingly  it was a
remarkable coincidence that, in these confidences
between mother and daughter whenever
Bernard did wrong, he was Laura's
brother, and whenever he did right he
was Mrs Freshfield's son. ' Mrs Pinner,
who had that unhappy girl under her
care whilst she was in Bluemere, says
she is a perfect heathen  a godless, irreverent
heathen  and everybody in the
parish knows it.'

I should like to wring Mrs Pinner's
neck cried Laura. * What business has
she to speak of Bernard's wife in such
terms } Why did you listen to her, mamma .'
I should have got up and left the room.
Now that the marriage is a completed thing,
we shall only cut our own throats by not
making the best of it ! I intend to call at

every house in Bluemere. and say It was
the very thing we secretly longed for.'

Just what I told Mrs Pinner, my dear,'
replied Mrs Freshfield, veering round like
a weathercock. ' I took her severely to task
for daring to mention anything but what
was favourable of a lady whom my son has
honoured by making his wife. But she is
an impertinent old gossip, and I hope that
Bernard will not encourage her visits to
Briarwood.'

I am afraid Berne will be led entirely
by Phyllida's wishes  at all events for the
present,' laughed Laura ; ' our poor boy is
very much in the chains, mamma, and all
that remains for us to do as good friends
and Christians, is to lend our aid to rivet
them as tightly on him as possible.'

Don't let us forget that it is his happiness
that is at stake,' continued Laura,
her bright eyes filled with tears of affection
; ' and make up our minds to see
only what is good in Phyllida for Berne's

sake. And I'll tweak the ears of anybody
whom I hear saying a word against her,'
she concluded, with a sudden change of
feeling.

Of course the parson's marriage was the
one theme of discussion in Bluemere for
many days after that. Never had more tea
been drunk or muffins buttered, in the course
of a single week, in the memory of the
oldest inhabitant. The ladies, married and
single, rushed from house to house, retailing
the extraordinary occurrence over and over
again with such scraps of information as
Mrs Pinner had gathered from her sister
Mrs Penfold. Lamentations ran high, and
prognostications of evil were plentifully exchanged
between the far-seeing ones. The
young ladies were naturally in despair, and
only the poor really rejoiced that the man
they loved had struck out a new source of
happiness for himself. Everybody in the
village had been very anxious to see how
Miss Annie Warren would bear the news,

for her hopes with regard to Briarwood had
been patent to the world. Many were the
ambassadors therefore who were sent to her
mothers house to ascertain, if possible, her
feelings on the subject, and to gloat over,
with true feminine charity, the disappointment
which they trusted she would be
unable to conceal.

But Miss Warren was too sharp for them,
and not a soul caught a glimpse of her
countenance until she had had time to place
a mask upon It ; but then the first thing she
did was to walk over to Blue Nlount with
her congratulations, and deliver a panegyric
on the bride.

Such a pretty creature,' she said, in
speaking of Phyllida. ' I am sure, Mrs
Freshfield, that In your wildest dreams you
never imagined a more beautiful daughter-in-law.
She will be quite an ornament to
Briarwood, and we shall all have to mind
our personal appearance when she rules
Bluemere. I used to say that everything

Miss Moss  I mean Mrs Bernard Fresh-field
 put on, became her.'

Yes, she has a lovely face, there is no
doubt of that. Miss Warren,' replied Mrs
Freshfield ; ' and if she is not very conversant
with parish duties at first, I shall
look to you to give her a few lessons.
You are quite my dear son's right hand
(as you were poor Alice's), and I am sure
he will be only too much obliged to you
if you will make Phyllida as useful as
yourself. He writes me she is a perfect
child in innocence. Therefore we need not
doubt she will prove as child-like in following
her husband's wishes.'

Miss Annie Warren coughed, but that was
all the answer she directly made to the old
lady's remark.

I shall be ready to help Mr Freshfield,
as I have ever been,' she said, as she rose,
basket on arm, to take her leave, ' whether
it be with the parish or anything else. But
I fancy, from what I have seen of her, that

Mrs Bernard will do the parochial work
her own way, and stick to it. Good-bye,
Mrs Freshfield. We are decoration the
church with white flowers for the minister
next Sunday. He will receive the heartiest
congratulations on his marriage from everyone
of his parishioners.'

And so Miss Annie Warren craftily concealed
her feelings in her own breast.
But they lay there unsubdued, all the same,
and only she knew what they were.

RS FRESH FIELD having apparently
condoned the irregularity
of her son's second marriage, all
Bluemere prepared itself to receive the bride
and bridegroom with open arms. They
would have rung the church bells, and decorated
the village with triumphal arches
and floral welcomes, had Bernard been
weak enough to disclose the day of his return.
But he much feared the display of
some such manifestation, and kept the
matter a secret, even from his mother. So
that she and Laura were sitting in the
drawing-room one afternoon, waiting for the

announcement of dinner, and actually speculating
on the probabilities of Bernard
speedy advent, when they looked up and
saw him standing on the threshold, with
Phyllida upon his arm. They had driven
over from Westertown in a hired vehicle,
and managed to reach Bluemere without a
soul being cognisant of the event. As
they walked up the carriage drive together,
Bernard had said to his wife, 

Are you nervous, Phyllida ? Does the
idea of meeting my mother make you
afraid ? ' and she had looked up in his face
and answered, 

Afraid! No; why should I be ? If
I was not afraid of marrying you, I need
hardly be so of meeting your relations.
Nothing can unmake me your wife, can it,
Bernard ? '

Nothing, my darling, thank God,' replied
Freshfield. 'You are mine for ever
and ever.'

So, as they stood upon the threshold together,

smiling, they looked more like people
who feel their presence brings a pleasant
surprise than offenders returning home to
sue for pardon.

Berne ! ' cried Laura, in a tone of rapture,
as she jumped up and ran into her
brother's arms. * Oh ! how delightful it is
to see you again. Mamma and I were
just wondering when you would return,'
and then as freely, if not as ardently, Laura
embraced her new sister. * Dear Phyllida,
we must be the very best and nearest of
friends, for I feel somewhat I shall love
you very much.'

Don't be too sure,' replied Phyllida, smiling.
* I have only one merit, and that is,
I am Bernard's wife.'

And that would be all sufficient,' said
Laura heartily. She forgot for the moment
how powerless the fact had proved to make
her love the oirl who smouldered in the
churchyard.

But Bernard, who had got over the first

rather tearful greeting which Mrs Fresh-field
bestowed upon him, now took Phyllis's
hand and led her up to his mother.

This is my wife' he said gravely. ' I
will not ask my friends to love her until
they do so for her own sake, but I want
them to remember always that, in my eyes,
she is sacred!

Mrs Freshfield had not quite made up
her mind whether she should receive the
bride as if she were a duchess or a milkmaid,
that is, if she should curtsey to the
ground with mock humility, or express her
welcome in the most familiar of nods. But
Bernard's address contained so much of
warning, that the weaker nature succumbed
to his. She took her daughter-in-law's hand,
and kissed her on the cheek as she said, 

My dear, I do not anticipate having to
love you for any reason, excepting that you
are yourself.'

You are all too kind to me,' faltered
Phyllida, in return.

She was looking very lovely In some
soft grey costume, that her enraptured husband
had purchased for her, and when (the
travellers having shaken the dust from their
garments and removed the effects of a railway
journey) the family sat down to the
dinner-table, the ladies of Blue Mount were
compelled to admit that a fairer guest than
the second Mrs Bernard Freshfield had
never graced their board. The old servants,
who had been in the family for any
number of years, could hardly take their
eyes off her as they moved about the room ;
and Bernard's spirits rose to a most un-clerical
height as he observed the favourable
impression she made.

As for Phyllida herself, except for an occasional
glance of affection at her husband,
she seemed perfectly unmoved by the silent
homage paid her. She neither blushed nor
giggled ; no consciousness of her position
as a bride made her hurried or nervous.
She leant back in her chair as easy and

unconstrained In her manners as if she had
Heed at Blue Mount all her life. Yet
Laura could not help observing that the
pathetic expression she had marked in
Miss Moss's countenance had not deserted
that of ]\lrs Bernard Freshfield, and that
Phyllida still looked more like a lovely
martyr than a happy bride. She admired
her sister-in-law all the more for beings
different from ordinary young ladies, but
the look in her face haunted her and raised
a host of conjectures which she dare not
breathe to any one but herself. Almost as
soon as dinner was over, Bernard asked
for the carrlaoe to take them to Briarwood,
as he was afraid the long railway journey
had fatigued his wife.

'And do you mean to say Mrs Garnett
does not know of your arrival ? ' said Laura.
Why, Berne, she'll have a fit. She has
sent over here every day for the last week
to ask If we had heard when you were
coming home.'

VOL. II.  F

I told her she might expect us any night
replied her brother, ' so she is sure to be
prepared with all we shall want, and I knew
if I let her know the exact time, she would
confide it to all Bluemere. I want Phyllida
to have a day or two in which to become
acquainted with her new home, before she
is seized upon by all the cackling old
women of the village.'

You will have a very beautiful home, my
dear,' said Mrs Freshfield solemnly to
Phyllida, ' and I trust you will keep it so.
There is, to my mind, no more fitting occupation
for a young wife than the personal
superintendence of her servants' daily work.
The eye of a mistress is a better guide than
any amount of experience.'

'I don't agree with you there, mother,'
exclaimed Bernard, who was inducting himself
into his overcoat ; * and I beg you wont
upset all the ideas with which I have been
imbuing Phyllida for the last fortnight. The
fittest occupation for a young wife is making

love to her husband, and that Is all she is
going to do for the next ten years.'

At this Laura laughed merrily, and Mrs
Freshfield looked scandalised.

But, my dear Bernard, surely you would
not advise Phylllda to entirely neglect her
household avocations ? '

No, I don't advise, I order her to neglect
them. I am not ofolne to have her turned

o o

into a housekeeper or head cook. What
do I pay old Garnett fifty pounds a-year
for, if it Is not to take all such domestic
worries off my wife's hands ? '

But, my dear son, you must think of
others as well as yourselves. Your wife Is
placed In a very prominent position, and
will assuredly be looked up to as an example
by all the ladies In Bluemere.'

Oh dear, I hope not ! ' cried Phylllda.

But It is the case, my dear,' continued
Mrs Freshfield, ' and no wishes can alter It.
A clergyman's wife must live for the parish,
and not for herself. Every mother In Blue-mere

should be able to point to you when
she wishes to exemplify to her daughters,
what a virtuous and useful life culminates
in.'

Phyllida looked timid, and moved closer
to her husband. Bernard bit his lip, and
as soon as he saw his opportunity, rushed
in with his usual impetuosity.

Look here, mother dear ! I know you
mean it all for kindness, but please don't
let us have any more of that. It is true
that I have accepted the parish, worse
luck ; and am bound in many things  I
may say in most things  to sacrifice my
own natural inclinations in deference to my
position. But my wife has bound herself
only to me ; and, once for all, to prevent any
future misunderstandings on the subject,
I do not intend to let her have anything
to do with the parish or its affairs. I hate
and detest the model parson's wife who
considers it her duty to poke her nose into
every cottage door as if it belonged to herself,

and lay her commands upon its Inmates
as if they were under her rule. I
will not have Phyllida do it. I married
her for myself  to be the mistress of my
house and servants, and my daily, hourly
companion and friend, and I don't mean
to give her up to any one, not even for a
minute.'

'Well, Bernard, all I can say is, that I
think you are sadly mistaken on this as
on many other subjects,' remarked his
mother quietly. She never attempted to
argue with her son.

I am sorry we differ, mother, but friends
must agree to differ sometimes. Another
thing that Phyllida and I intend to dispense
with is the abomination of wedding
calls. Please let Bluemere know that there
will be no particular day on which they can
visit Briarwood, and find my wife dressed
in a prismatic silk, sitting up to be looked
at behind a silver basket piled with indigestible
cake. We shall always be pleased

to receive our friends, and when we are
at home they will be sure to find us either
in the garden, or the stables, or the kennels,
or the piggeries, or employed in some other
occupation equally congenial to our mutual
tastes. So, good-night, mother dear, and
good-night, Laura. Come over to dinner
with us tomorrow, and see how we look
sitting in state at our own table. Come,
love, it is time we were off.' And Bernard
handed his wife into the carriage,
and drove away with her. Mrs Freshfield
returned to the drawing-room, dismally
shaking her head.

Laura ! Laura ! I am afraid this is all
terribly irregular.'

Not the marriage, I hope, mamma ? '

My dear, you know what I mean. I
always considered your brother far too lax
with poor Alice. He allowed Miss Warren
to usurp all the parochial duties, and it
will be worse still with Phyllida. He will
ruin her with indulgence. To spend her

days in the iarden or the stables or the
kennel  you heard what he said  I ask
you candidly, is that the proper way fora
clergyman's wife to amuse herself ? '

I should think the proper thing for her
was to do exactly as her husband wishes.
I don't understand a grown woman being-ruined
by indulgence, mamma. Depend
on it, many more have been ruined by
repression. And I don't think Phyllida
could do parish work if she tried. She
doesn't look that sort of person, does
she ? '

No, not at all that sort of person 
anything, in fact, but that sort of person,'
reiterated Mrs Freshfield, with fearfully
mysterious meaning as she sighed profoundly.


Laura thought it best to change the subject.
As the carriage drove into the gates
of Briarwood, Bernard turned towards his
wife and took her in his arms.

We are nearly home,' he said. * May

it ever prove a true home to you, my own
dear love, a true refuge and haven from
every earthly 111 and annoyance. If / can
make it so, it shall.'

Phyllida buried her face in his.

Oh, Bernard ! you are too good and
trusting. Suppose  supposing, after all,
that I should prove a disappointment to
you ? '

I do not think that Is possible, but were
it so, the remembrance of the happiness
you have already given me would go far
to soften it. But do not fear that I expect
too much from you. We are neither of
us faultless, and as I hope you will exercise
forbearance towards me, so do I anticipate
sometimes having to call mine into
action for your sake. We shall have, like
all other mortals, to contend against many
disadvantages In one another. We may
not hold the same opinions ; we may not
like the same people ; occasionally our tempers
will clash and cause us some uneasiness.

But we love each other, and in all
the rest I shall leave you free  free to
exercise your own ideas and go your own
way  perfectly satisfied if from that way
you return to the shelter of my arms, and
find an answer for every vexatious question
of life in my never-failing love.'

This was the welcome she received to
Briarwood, and as the carriage stopped beneath
the portico, and Phyllida was handed
into the luxurious hall, and saw the servants
over whom she was thenceforth to
reign as mistress, she seemed to realise, for
the first time, what a stupendous change
had taken place for her, since but a few
weeks back she had been thrown on the
protection of ]airs Pinner. Yet she turned
from it all and threw herself into her husband's
arms, and assured him a thousand
times,  'It is yozi  you only that I
want.'

She would have resigned her new possessions,
in the first triumph of feeling them

to be hers, for a simple luxury that her
waiting - maids enjoyed with impunity and
thought nothing of  'a conscience free
from offence.'

The rector had not been within the walls
of Briarwood twelve hours before everyone
in Bluemere knew he had returned ; but
as no notification of the fact was made
public, they were obliged to control their
impatience to see the bride until she should
appear in church on Sunday. Only Mrs
Pinner was bold enough to invade the
sanctity of their home without an invitation,
and she had completely changed her
tactics In speaking of Phyllida, and laid
claim to double the amount of consideration
she received before, in right of her
cousinship to the parson's wife.

Knowing that Phyllida's ideas of religion,
if honest, were rather peculiar, Bernard had
purposely abstained from expressing the
least wish that she should accompany him
to. church on Sunday, as It was his firm

intention, unless he could bias her mind, to
leave her actions free.

When he came down on that day, however,
preparatory to starting for the morning
service, he found her ready dressed
and waiting for him in the portico.

Are you coming with me, my darling ? '
he said, with pleased surprise.

Of course I am,' she answered. ' Did
you think I should remain at home ? '

I thought very little about It, love, excepting
that I wish you to do exactly as
you like ; and you have told me you do
not like going to church.'

No more I used to no more I do now,
in fact  only I want to go with you.'

And I am only too delighted to have
you, my Phyllida. The church would look
very empty to me without your dear face ;
but I want you to feel quite, quite free in
this matter as in all others.'

No ; don't say that,' she whispered,
gazing up Into his face with sweet, troubled

eyes   ' don't let me feel free, Bernard,
now that I belong to you. Make me good,
whether I want it or not. You promised
you would, and I will try  indeed, I will
if you will only order me to do everything
that you think is best for me.'

You dear child,' replied her husband,
if we all regarded the Almighty with
the same feelings with which you regard
me, the evangelical Christians might shut
up their hell at once.'

Are you an evangelical Christian, Bernard
? ' demanded Phyllida.

No, Phyllida.'

Do you call yourself High Church,
then ? '

I don't call myself anything.'

But what are you ? '

Your husband, darling ; that is quite
enough for you ; and now if you are
coming to church with me we must have
the carriage.'

I can walk, Bernard.'

I don't wish you to walk. I know
many people think it very wicked to use
their horses on Sunday, who think nothing
of the wickedness of using their servants ;
but my notions on such subjects are peculiar.
And one is that it will do our
horses less harm to trot for a couple
of miles than it will do my wife. So,
go and sit down again until the carriage
comes round.'

It would have indeed been a terrible disappointment
to Bluemere if Mrs Bernard
Freshfield had not appeared in church
that morning, although her defalcation
would have afforded them just cause fora
little extra malice over their teacups.
Every pew was crowded with eagerly
expectant faces as Bernard led his young
wife up the aisle and placed her in her
seat, and the whispered comments that
followed her appearance ran through the
congregation like the buzzing of bees.
Every woman's bonnet was thrust into

the bonnet of her next neighbour, and
they would have been struck dumb by
the apparition in the parson's pew, except
for the pleasure of saying that they were
so. Those who had been so unlucky
as to only catch sight of her back, asked
each other in awestruck tones if it could
possibly be Mrs Bernard Freshfield ; but
when, on changing her position, Phyllida
let the whole church have a view of her
profile, there could be no longer any doubt
on the subject. But what had come to
her ? What wonderful transformation was
this from the somewhat reserved young
lady in a black merino dress, who had
excited their comments as Mrs Pinner's
cousin ? As the service commenced and
Phyllida stood up with the rest, the responses
went entirely out of their heads.
They had expected naturally to see her
bloom forth in wedding garments ; but
the dress she wore : the golden brown
velvet costume, with point lace ruffles at

her throat and wrists and a couple of
yellow roses nestling under her chin, and
a broad-brimmed hat of some white, furry
material that enraged her sunny hair
like a snow-drift  it was the amazement
of this style, unknown in Bluemere, that
caused so much irreverence that mornings.
Where had she learned to dress in such
a manner ? From whom had she acquired
the taste ? Who had taught Phyllida Moss
to carry her head like a princess, and
wear her fashionable garments as though
she had never been used to any other ?

They had expected to see her come
back blushing, confused and ready to sink
under the unexpected honour conferred upon
her, and here she was, receiving the silent
homage of their curiosity, as if she had
been some earl's daughter who had condescended
to marry Mr Freshest ! It was
incredible. Poor Mrs Pinner was assailed
from so many quarters at once upon this
point, and spoke so much louder than she

intended to do In answering her assailants,
that Mr Robinson had to cough her down
in the middle of the service. But as soon
as It was over she had her revenge.

Where did she learn to dress so ? Really,
Mrs Norman, one might think my cousin
had never been In any society to hear you
ask such a question ! Haven't I told sou
that her parents lived In St Domingo, and
mixed in the highest circles there, which
are chiefly composed of French people,
Phyllida tells me, and are of course up to
all the French fashions.'

But she has such a peculiar dress on ?
Do you think it pretty ? ' demanded Miss
Lacy. ' My mamma thinks a light-coloured
silk would be so much more appropriate
for a bride.'

Ah, your good mamma has lived In the
country all her life, my dear, and cannot
be expected to know the fashions. My
cousin has come straight from London, remember,
so she can hardly be mistaken.' :

Whether it Is the fashion or not, it is
a very extraordinary dress for a minister's
wife to appear at church in,' remarked
another young lady spitefully. ' I am sure
Mr Freshfield must have been hurt by the
evident surprise It occasioned. And his dear
mamma too and Miss. Laura, I didn't envy
them having to sit in the same pew with
her!'

You had better not talk at random, Miss
Masters ! I have seen my cousin naturally
(although it was Mr Freshfield's wish that
no one in the village but myself and his
own relations should intrude at Briarwood
until his wife had appeared In church),
and Phyllida told me only yesterday that
her husband admired that dress so much
that he had ordered one exactly similar
to be made for his sister Laura. But
perhaps you will not believe that I am
better informed than yourself, and perhaps
my being cousin to Mrs Bernard
Freshfield, and cousin-inlaw to the rector,
VOL. 11. G

does not warrant my knowledge of their
private affairs,' concluded Mrs Pinner
grandly.

Miss Masters tossed her head.

I am sure I meant nothing of the sort.
If Mr Freshfield likes his wife to attend
church in a scarlet gown, or no gown at
all, it is all the same to me. I only expressed
the general opinion in saying her
costume was peculiar. And as for her hat,
I never saw such a thing in my life. Did
you, Miss Warren ? '

Miss Annie Warren, just issuing from
the church door, was not in the most
amiable temper. It had been a weekly
custom of hers during the lifetime of the
late Mrs Freshfield to drive home in the
rector's carriage after the morning service,
and spend the rest of the day at Briar-wood.


Alice had liked her society, and Bernard's
affection for his wife had been of too milk-and-water
a description to resent the presence

of a third party. But he had no
intention of allowing his tctes-d-tctc with
Phyllida to be intruded upon more than
was absolutely necessary. So that though
Miss Warren waited outside the vestry
door in the old fashion, and would have
gladly renewed her former footing at the
rectory, all she had received from the nev/ly-
married couple was a shake of the hand,
and Bernard had driven off, looking the
picture of happiness, leaving her, with a
very empty feeling at her heart, to find her
way back to her friends as best she could.
But Annie Warren was made of different
material from Miss Lacy or Miss Masters,
or any of the other misses who populated
Bluemere. Her disappointment at the rector's
marriage had been bitter and severe ;
her hatred of the rector's new wife was
bitterer and severer still. Her's was nota
nature to forget or forgive easily, and
there was a trace of Indian blood in her
veins that imbued it with a still more vindictive

Instinct ; she could avait for her
revenge. But it was not part of her plan
to quarrel with Mrs Pinner, or indeed with
any one ; and it would have been the
height of Impolicy In her to do anything
to widen the breach which was already
yawning between the Freshfields and herself.
So she reproved Miss Masters' unkind
speech In a thoroughly Christian-like
and womanly ways

I am surprised,' she said, ' to find that
the admirable lessons we have just heard,
and the prayers In which we have joined,
have had no better effect than to make
you discuss hats and dresses, Miss Masters.
What can It signify what people wear ?
What they do is of the only real consequence,
and we may be quite sure that
Mrs Bernard Freshfield's conduct will have
the approbation of our dear minister In
all things ; may we not, Mrs Pinner ? '
she added, with a honied smile.

Indeed we may, my dear,' replied Mrs

Pinner, delighted to find so staunch anally
where she least expected it ; ' such a
couple you never saw, they are perfectly
devoted to each other, and Mr Freshfield
seems as if he couldn't do too much for
his wife. Have you been to Briarwood
yet?'

No ; I did not like to disturb them so
soon after their return, though I ann such
an old friend,' rejoined Miss Annie, who
had the greatest difficulty to prevent her
eyes flashing the lightning with which they
were laden.

Come up with me this evening, will
you ? I am sure they will be delighted
to see you, and as for myself, of course, I
am always welcome in my own cousin's
house. It will be a nice walk for us,
and if you will take a cup of tea with me
first I shall be very pleased.'

Thank you, dear INIrs Pinner. I will
be with you about six o'clock,' replied
Miss Warren, who wanted to find out a

great deal more about the bride's antecedents
than she at present knew.

Meanwhile Bernard and Phyllida, unconscious
of the treat in store for them,
having taken their luncheon, sat together
on the lawn under the chestnut trees.
There were only two services on Sunday in
Bluemere, and the curate, Mr Robinson,
conducted the afternoon one, therefore,
when his morning duties were over, Bernard
had the rest of the day to himself.
Phyllida was lying back in a low chair
with her eyes fixed upon the sky ; and
her husband had been watching her, and
thinking how beautiful she was for the last
ten minutes.

Phyllida,' he said suddenly, ' I shall have
to give you a pew at the back of the
pulpit ! '

Why, Bernard ? '

Because you are too fascinating for a
parson's wife, and I keep looking at you
instead of my book, and I know I shouldn't.

I must try and forget you, my darling,
at all events whilst I am reading prayers ;
and the only way to do that Is to put you
out of slept.'

I would rather not see you either, Bernard.
It made me miserable to see you
dressed up In that night-gown thing this
morning. I wish you could read the
prayers in a pretty tweed coat  like the
grey one you used to wear at Lynton 
with a rose in your buttonhole.'

Bernard laughed.

I wish I could, too, Phyllida, for I can
assure }'ou I dislike the " night-gown '' quite
as much as you do ! But though I believe
my views are as broad as those of most
men, I have not yet reached the pitch of
appearing in the pulpit In a tweed suit.
But how could my surplice affect you to
the extent of maklncr you miserable ? '

Oh, it seemed to raise you so high
above me. I looked up at your grave face,
and I thought, " What can I have in common

with a minister of religion ? " It made me
feel I can never be good enough for you.
Berne, I Hke you so much better in a
shooting-coat  you don't know ! I guess
you are nearer to me that way.'

I guess I can't be nearer to you than I
am, you Hide Yankee ! '

PhylHda turned sharply.

Why do you call me a Yankee ? *

Why, aren't you always telling me that
you 'guess'' this and you 'guess'' that ? '

My father had been to America  I suppose
that is the reason,' she said nervously.

I daresay it is, for you have several other
Americanisms which you must have picked
up from some one with whom you have been
familiar. But you are charming, notwithstanding,
Mrs Freshfield.'

She smiled at him, but still she sighed,
and lay quiet for a few minutes more, gazing
up into the sky.

Bernard, why is it necessary for everybody
to think the same . '

What do you mean, Phyllida ? '

Why may not everybody try to get to
heaven in his own way ? Why must there
be different religions and churches, and why
must everybody who belongs to the same
religion hold just the same opinions, and
repeat the same prayers, and" go to church
at the same time ? Why must it all be so
formal and prim, and every man think
just the same as every other man ? Do
you understand me ? Why mayn't we do
as wee like, so long as we do what seems tous
the very best ? '

Bernard rose from his seat by her side,
and began to pace hurriedly up and down
the shaven turf.

Have I said anything wrong ? Are you
angry?' demanded Phyllida timidly.

'Angry! Xo ! How should I be, and
with you ' But your words have touched
a tender chord in my breast, Phyllida,
and renewed a question that is ever tormenting
me. I have never dared to say

as much to any other mortal, but I would
have my wife familiar with every phase of
my character.

Why may not man, in the matter which
so nearly concerns his future, think for himself,
instead of being compelled, on pain of
eternal damnation, to adopt the opinions of
those set over him, whether his Intellect can
approve them or not ?

Why, Indeed ! This is the question that
has haunted me ever since I became old
enough to think for myself, and has Infused a
doubt in my mind that poisons a profession I
miofht otherwise love to hold. I know what
I believe myself I have thought it out and
argued it out, and proved it by testimony,
which to my mind Is incontrovertible  therefore
I am happy and contented In my faith,
and desire no other. But why, because /
believe such and such things must my
neighbour necessarily believe them also ?
What my Intellect approves with ease, his
may utterly refuse to embrace ; whereas

another dogma, which I cannot grasp, may
commend itself highly to his senses. This,
then, is my difficulty  not what to believe
myself, but what to teach others to believe.
To attempt to cram a faith down a man's
throat whether he will or not, is tantamount
to forcing unpalatable food into his mouth.
What good will it do him when swallowed ?
I have sat for hours, thinking it my duty
trying with all my might to make some old
sinner believe the same truths as I do, and
the result has generally been that I have
left him more obstinately determined to go
his own way than before. And how can
we tell  this is the est of the whole
matter  whether that way, however wrong
it may appear in our eyes, may not bethe
very means by which the man is fore-destined
to be eventually saved. For mark
}'0u, Phyllida, sin is as absolutely a necessary'
component of the world's economy as
virtue. If there were no sin, there could
be no virtue. Who could exercise forgiveness

without offence  generosity without
debt  charity without malice  courage
without temptation ? To call forth the corresponding
grace there must be evil ; and
surely, so long as we individually exercise
the virtues within our power, we may safely
leave the evil with Him who created it.
You asked me this morning if I were an
evangelical or a High Church Christian,
and I answered you neither. For I don't
want to belong to any sect at all, and my
error has been to belong to any Church.
If I could give up my profession tomorrow
I would. My mother is the only person
who keeps me in it. It would make her
so unhappy if she thought I even contemplated
such a step, and I owe my mother-much,
dear Phyllida. She has been a good
mother to me.'

And you cannot love her too much in
return,' cried the girl warmly. ' Oh, my
own dear, dear mother ! What would I not
sive to see hej once again.'

Bernard came up close to his wife, and
gazed into her tearful eyes.

I suppose,' he said lovingly, * the dear,
good, charitable, Christian world, who take
a delight in condemning every one to hellfire
who differs from themselves, would call
you a very godless sort of little heathen ; but
I hold one such speech from your lips as
worth all their whining, canting platitudes
about their duty or their religion. M\
mother has not been even* cordial in her
welcome of you, mv darling  I have seen
that, and so have } ou  but those sweet, unselfish
words came straight from your noble
heart and have gone up like incense before
the Throne. There was more true Christian
feeling in that one sentence than in
half the sermons in the world I '

No, no,' cried Phyllida, visibly distressed.
* Don't say that  don't think it,
Bernard. I know what my own heart is.
The worst you can think of me is better
than I am.'

I will not speak of It If you desire me
not, my darling, but you must leave me to
think of you as I choose. But I have
told you now the difficulties of my position,
Phyllida. As a layman I should be the
happiest fellow In creation, but the duties
that have been thrust upon me are burdensome.
I am bound to preach much that
I cannot accept, and I dare not honestly
proclaim what I believe myself, so my conscience
Is constantly warring with my sense
of obligation. My friend Anderson has
tried very hard to convert me to his own
opinions ; but to leave the church I am in
for another would not better my position.
I search each one In turn, and I find the
same fetters everywhere. The priesthood
I use the term advisedly, and Intend it
to embrace every description of minister 
preach the faith in which they have been
ordained, and will have it that man can
be saved in no other. This Is what grates
against my common sense and my knowledge

of the Almighty', and I want to preach
that man can not be saved by inlaid
down plan, but only by God, and in God's
own way, and that to further such an end
God requires no church, nor prayers, nor
opinions, nor ceremonies. He wants only
our love.'

And as Bernard spoke thus, he too lifted
his eyes to heaven in a silent prayer.

You see the reason now, my darling
wife,' he continued, ' why I will not lay the
slightest restriction on you with regard to
religious duties. I will have you do exactly
as you feel inclined. The means which
suit me may harden you ; the set prayers
that help another soul to heaven may drive
you from it. Be free then, my sweetheart,
and be happy and true, and when I love
you most, think that it is but a spark, a
flicker, an imperfect reflection of the flame
of love which emanates from your Heavenly
Father to yourself, and has done from the
beginning of the world.'

Bernard had found out by this time that
PhylHda's nature was variable and easily
excited, but he was hardly prepared for
the passionate burst of weeping with which
she received his last words. She cried so
violently and unrestrainedly that he was
afraid the attention of the household would
be directed to it, and it was with some difficulty
that he soothed her emotion and
restored her to her usual calmness before
their unwelcome visitors, Mrs Pinner and
Miss Warren, were announced.

Once more settled at Briarwood,
with Phyllida for his daily companion,
and surrounded by his
home interests, Bernard Freshfield's private
life left him nothing to desire, and his wife
experienced (what few women do) the privilege
of being a good and clever man's friend,
without being compelled to be his echo. He
left her absolutely free, body and soul, and
no prisoner set at large ever valued his
liberty more. The season, though far advanced
in September, was still mild enough
for out-door enjoyment, and to ramble
the plantations, followed by the

VOL. II. H

through

dogs ; or to take the lessons on horseback
which her husband had commenced
to give her ; or to sit under the trees
for a whole forenoon, happy and lazy,
without being questioned as to the propriety
of her actions, was perfect bliss to
Phyllida. What thoughts passed through
her yet girlish brain as she sat, silent
and impassive, beneath the chestnut trees,
Bernard never asked and never wished
to know. He considered the soul of a
woman to be as much her own property
as the soul of a man, and that no one had
a right to peer into its secrets except Him
from whom it is impossible to hide them.

Yet he studied his young wife's character
anxiously, if not officiously." Even during
the short time they had been married, he
had been obliged to confess to himself
that she was a puzzle to him  for her
nature seemed made up of two parts, and
they were utterly opposed to one another.
In company she was always somewhat

reserved and silent. Mrs Freshfield
thought she was stupid and unused to
society, and Laura trusted she was not
of a cold or uncongenial disposition. Mrs
Freshfield's disappointment at her son's
marriage to a girl of whom, as she said,
No one knew anything was too recent
to admit of her showing more than politeness
to the mistress of Briarwood ;
but Laura was nervously anxious, both
for her brother's sake and her own, to
make friends with her new sister. But
the result was certainly unsatisfactory. The
more the warm-hearted Laura poured her
confidences into Phyllida's ear, and pressed
for hers in return, the more did Bernard's
wife seem to shrink within herself and
become silent and abstracted. Her husband
would have been as unhappy at this
state of things as his sister, had he not
known how differently Phyllida behaved
when alone with him, and attributed it
entirely to her shyness with strangers.

Wait,' he used to say to Laura, ' till
Phyllida has become as familiar with you
as she is with me, and you will find that
she is a perfect child in all her ways and
manners.'

And he had reason to say so, for when
they were alone together no gay unthinking
child could pass more rapidly from one
phase of feeling to another. Sometimes
she would be hilariously gay, and chatter
and laugh by the hour. The wildest, most
enchanting creature that ever held fast
the senses of man !

When she was in this mood (which
occurred by far the seldom of the two)
Phyllida would sing snatches of sportive
little songs, with an archness and abandon
that held her husband breathless
with surprise and pleasure ; or she would
dance before him as naturally as a child
dances to its mother on the nursery floor ;
or she would seize the nearest thing at hand,
a shawl, a table napkin, a coloured scarf,

and twist it about her head and shoulders,
and transform herself to some one else,
and under that guise act a dual part,
keeping up an imaginary conversation,
which evolved such sparkles of wit that
Bernard, remembering her usual quiet
demeanour, would be fairly startled, and
wish that all Bluemere could come and
admire her versatility as much as he
did. At such times she appeared a perfect
woman of the world, a little hard
perhaps, but with the most consummate
ease, and a thorough knowledge that she
was charming. But her general demeanour
(and it was always strikingly so after one
of these outbursts) was so subdued as
to be almost melancholy. Bernard would
detect her in the act of heaving a sigh
sometimes that seemed to come from the
very depths of her heart ; and she would
start and blush when accused of it, and
turn it off with a merry declaration that
it was all indigestion, and that if she continued

to eat so much and do so little,
she would soon be qualified to go round
the country in a caravan as the ' Fat Lady
And then she would jump up, declaring
that in that case she must have some
dancing dogs to accompany her, and let
all the dogs loose, and make them dance
with her upon the lawn and chase her
through the shrubberies, whilst her husband
watched her gambols with the purest
pleasure. Only sometimes (much as he
admired the languid far-away look in her
lovely eyes) he wished that the dogs and
flowers, and all the other innocent joys in
which she revelled, had the power to
chase it away, and leave her free to delight
in them alone.

When, after the lapse of a few weeks, it
became patent to Bluemere that Mrs Bernard
Freshfield had no intention of taking
any part in the parochial work, the
whole community felt aggrieved, and her
mother-in-law made it the fruitful theme

of many a discussion with her daughter
Laura.

If Bernard does not wish it, mamma,'
Laura would say, ' I cannot see how Phyl-
ida can possibly undertake it. Surely her
duty to her husband Is her first duty ; and
you know he always said he would not
have his wife pottering about the labourers*
cottages with a basket full of flannel and
tracts. The parishioners of Bluemere have
no cause to complain ; they can have all
their wants supplied and their troubles inquired
into at Briarwood, and I believe
they much prefer going up to Mrs Garnett
to having ladles visit them.'

Laura, it Is useless of you to try and
defend your sister-in-law's conduct. You
speak as if she were a perfect child instead
of a woman ! Do you mean to tell
me that she married my son without the
slightest thought of the responsibilities of
the position she undertook ? A clergyman's
wife to do nothing but ride on horseback,

and drive about the country on the box-seat
of her husband's curricle, and pay calls
and receive them  why, it is perfectly
iniquitous ! And she dresses in a manner
to which, I am sure, she must have been
quite unaccustomed. Every one at Sir George
Winter's the other night was staring at
her white inoird and the costly lace with
which it was trimmed  pearls round her
throat, too ! That foolish boy is spending
all his substance on her, and for a person
of whom one \r\o\N?> absolutely nothing I It
is no wonder people stare at the exhibition
of so much folly.'

Say rather, mamma, they stare at so
much beauty ! Phyllida is the prettiest
woman that has been seen in this part of
the country in my remembrance, and I don't
wonder poor Berne is half off his head
about her. I heard people saying at Sir
George Winter's that she was a perfect
picture ; and I think, mamma, that you ought
to be very proud of your daughter-in-law.'

Well, well,' replied ]airs Freshfield, but
half-mollified, ' her beaut' should not prevent
her doing her duty, and I think Bernard
is much to blame not to insist upon
it. He lays everything on ?IIss Warren's
shoulders In a manner that few young ladles
would bear so quietly. That poor girl
positively attends to everything, from the
Dorcas society and the mothers' meetings
to the school prizes and the harvest festival.
It Is most unfair that Bernard's wife
should not share her labours, and I think
she would be quite justified In resigning
her post'

Oh come, mamma,' cried Laura, laughing,
' don't make a grievance out of that, for
you know that Annie Warren undertook the
parish work entirely of her own accord, and
Bernle would like nothing better than to
see his way to relieve her of it. He says
she Is the greatest plague he has, and makes
more mischief in the village than he has time
to undo. jNIIss Warren would probably consider

herself very much injured if Phyllida
were to enter one of the cottages without
her leave.'

But in this surmise Laura Freshfield
happened to be mistaken. Strange to say,
Miss Warren was as anxious now that
Phyllida should share the burden of her
parochial work, as she had been before to
prevent her doing so. Her hopes of becoming
the mistress of Briarwood being
unmistakably blighted, she did not see the
advantage of toiling for the remainder of
her life in the service of the parson. And
it maddened her as she went her daily
rounds with a heavy basket on her arm,
and a thousand annoyances to beset her
way, to think of the girl she had so looked
down upon as Mrs Pinners cousin taking
her ease at Briarwood, clad in the costly
robes her husband purchased for her, or visiting
the best houses in the county, and being
declared the belle wherever she appeared.
So she was very much bent on letting

Bernard know, in a perfectly amicable
manner, that if his wife did not intend to
take her share of the parochial duties, he
must find some one that would. Consequently,
as he sat at breakfast one morning
with Phyllida in a cashmere and satin quilted
dressing-gown in a chair very near his own,.
Miss Warren, with the inevitable basket on
one arm and a large roll of brown paper
under the other, walked into the room unceremoniously
and opened fire with an exclamation
of surprise.

At breakfast, at half-past ten in the
morning ! What a shocking waste of time !
Wliy, I hardly thought I should find you at
home, Mr Freshfield ! Isn't this the day
that was fixed for distributing the garden
seeds to the men at Brick Common ? '

I believe it is,' replied Bernard, crossing
his legs and unfolding a newspaper.
Robinson has gone over there, I suppose ?
I told him to see to it for me.'

Dear me ! I made sure you would distribute

the seeds yourself. The cottagers
will be very much disappointed, and I don't
think Mr Robinson knows anything about
the matter.'

He must find out, then,' said Freshfield
curtly ; and then wishing to make amends,
hie addressed his wife, ' Phyllida, are you not
going to ask Miss Warren to take a cup
of coffee ? '

Phyllida blushed, and moved towards the
tea equipage.

I beg your pardon, Miss Warren. Which
<lo you prefer, tea or coffee ? '

Thank you, I will take coffee,' replied
the unwelcome visitor, depositing her load
on the floor, and drawing a chair to the
table, ' I have been so busy all the morning,
I have hardly had time to think of breakfast.
My work would never be done if
I lay in bed after six o'clock. No one
knows the cares of a parish, except those
who undertake them, and I really have
more on my hands than I can well accomplish.

It will be impossible to go on in
this way much longer without help.'

Let me know what part of it you consider
too onerous, and I will relieve you
of it at once, Miss Warren,' exclaimed Bernard.
' I have the names of half-a-dozen
ladies on my list who have asked me to
give them some work to do in Bluemere,
and are only waiting to pick up the crumbs
your busy hands let fall'

But this was not what Miss Warren was
striving for. She wanted to see Phyllida
(who, she believed, would hate such work)
forced or shamed into doings it.

Naturally, Mr Freshfield, all who call
themselves Christians, or wish the world ta
think them so, must desire to labour in
the vineyard. It should be a privilege.,
and with right-minded persons it is so.
And therefore I have been waiting to-learn
what share of the duty your wife
intends to take upon herself, before we
discuss the propriety of letting others usurp-her

right of choice. Of course Mrs Bernard
doe's intend to become a visitor amongst her
husband's people. It would be a noticeable
fact if she did not,' concluded Miss Annie,
with a hard stare at Phyllida, who began
stammering,  

I will  will  do anything that Bernard
wishes me to do  but  but  '

Btitl said Freshfield, wheeling round his
chair, so as to face Miss Warren, ' I do
not wish my wife to meddle in the parish
affairs at all ; more, I do not intend that
she shall do so. She has not been used to
such work, and she doesn't like it, and I have
plenty of assistance without hers. If the
ladies of Bluemere find it irksome, Robinson
will take it off their hands, and if it becomes
too much for him I will get a second
curate. So you see. Miss Warren, I have
provided against all contingencies, and intend
Mrs Freshfield to stick to her own
business, which is to look after me.'

Oh, of course if that is your decision.

Mr Freshfield, there Is no more to be said
on the subject,' replied Miss Warren tartly.
It is very unusual, and it will excite some
discussion, but I daresay Mrs Bernard will
not mind that. But a rector's wife is a
very noticeable person, and the parish expect
more of her perhaps than of others.
This morning, for example, I quite thought
I should secure ]airs Bernard's co-operation
in covering the school books. I have the
paper with me, you see, and was on my
way to the schoolroom, when I looked inhere.
Indeed, I half promised the teachers
that your wife would inspect the premises
to-day, and know they will be prepared to
see her. It seems so strange that she
should have returned home nearly a month,
and not even been over the school-rooms
or alms-houses yet'

Well, she Is not going over them, certainly
not as a duty, neither can she cover
old school-books, Miss Warren. Indeed,
she is bound not to leave home this morning,

as we expect the Ashleighs to lunch.
If, when PhylHda is better acquainted with
Bluemere and its people, she likes to visit
their cottages from a feeling of friendliness
I shall be the last person to wish to deprive
my parishioners of what is such a
pleasure to myself ; but it is no duty of
hers to do so, and I will not have her
think it.'

Well, I suppose I had better ask Miss
Masters or Mrs Wedgwood to help me,'
replied Miss Warren, with an air of martyrdom
; * for no one could be expected tO'
put fresh covers on three hundred books ina
morning with one pair of hands.'

Please leave them altogether said Bernard,
* and I will see they are covered without
laying myself under an obligation to
anyone.'

*0h dear, no, Mr Freshfield ! What I
undertake I will do, even if I die under it.
No one shall ever have it in their power to
say that / shirked any part of the duty that

falls to my share as a labourer in the Lord's
vineyard

Bernard was afraid he might be tempted
to say something rude, and thought it best
to change the conversation.

Give me another cup of tea, darling,'
he said, addressing his wife ; and then, just
as she was handing it to him, he added, ' I
have had such a nice letter this morning 
I must read it to you by-and-by  from a
very old friend of mine, now in America
Nelson Cole ! '

Something must have startled Phyllida at
that moment, or the evil eye of Annie
Warren was fixed upon her, and made her
hand unsteady ; for down went the cup and
saucer with a crash, deluging the tablecloth
with hot tea, and when Bernard looked
up at the unexpected clatter, he was horrified
to see that his wife had sunk back in
the nearest chair, and was staring at him
with wide-open, frightened eyes. He sprang
to her side in alarm.

VOL. II. I

Phyllida, Phyllida, my darling ! What
is the matter ? She Is ill  she is fainting !
Please open the window, Miss Warren, and
give me a glass of water from the sideboard.
Thank you. She will be better
now. What can have been the cause of
this sudden attack ? '

I don't think Mrs Bernard is ill remarked
Miss Warren, with quiet malice.
I was watching her face all the time, and
I imagine it was something soil said that
upset her nerves.'

Phyllida turned her head and looked at
the speaker. Their eyes 'met, and from
that moment the two women knew that
they were enemies.

It is untrue,' she answered slowly, but
her voice faltered as she spoke. ' I am ill
faint. I don't know what is the matter
with me, but it is nothing that you said,
Bernard.'

I don't see how it could be,' he remarked
ingenuously. ' I was only speaking

of my friend's letter. Miss Warren's visions
of parish work are much more Hkely to
have upset you, PhylHcla.'

In which case, perhaps, I had better
take my leave ? ' said Miss Warren, ' though
I can scarcely accept the blame you would
like to impute to me, Mr Freshfield. Your
wife's constitution must indeed be delicate
if she cannot even bear the mention of her
duty. Our dear lost Alice, frail as she was,
had a soul which could at all times take an
interest in the wants of others. Dear saint !
Were she but on earth, she would be the
first to lighten me of my heavy burthen.
But those days are over. Shall I send
Mrs Garnett in to attend to Mrs Bernard
? '

No, thank you, Miss Warren. I can do
all that she requires for her. Good morning.
If Phyllida is quite recovered I shall
ride over to Brick Common this afternoon,
and hear what the men have to say about
their plots of ground.'

As soon as they found themselves alone,
Bernard poured out his whole wealth of
tenderness upon his wife, and implored her
to confide to him the cause of her sudden
fright or illness. But the girl was resolute
in evading his questions. It was the
weather  the change of season  she was
over tired  she had not slept well the night
before  It was everything or nothing. It
was anything, in fact, but the effect of
what she had heard or seen.

And I am so sorry I interrupted you,'
continued Phyllida in a low voice that still
trembled, ' because you were going to tell
me something about  about  a friend of
yours  In  In  America, and I Avant to
hear all  all  you can tell me of him,
Bernard,' she said, with white lips.

I will read you his letter, my darling,
or you shall read it for yourself  if you
would like it better. He is a dear old
fellow, but rather a rough diamond, not a
lady's man by any manner of means ; but

we have always been the best of friends
and companions, notwithstanding the difference
in our ages ; for I suppose Cole must
be fifty by this time. He was very kind tome
when I was a youngster, and though
he has been in the United States for the
last five years, we keep up a steady correspondence,
though not a very constant one.
And he writes so kindly, too. I believe
he really cares for me.'

Phyllida came and seated herself on her
husband's lap, and clasped her trembling
arms round his neck.

And is this friend of yours  this Mr
Cole,' she asked, 'going to live all his life
in Chicago ? '

'In Chicago, dearest ! What pat that
in your head .? ' said Bernard, with a look
of surprise.

Didn't you say he was out there ? '

No ; I don't think I mentioned any
place in particular, but he has been in
Chicago several times, notwithstanding. He

has been employed on the railway there.
He is a civil engineer. You will laugh
when you read his letter, Phyllida. He
'' chaffs " me so for saying I shall never
marry again. But that was six months
ago, you know, before I met you, my darling
! What will he say when he hears
my resolution is broken } I shall never
hear the last of it.'

Don't tell him, Bernard. It can be of
no consequence to him, and I should not
like to be laughed at, if I were you.'

Oh, I don't mind his fun, it is all good-natured.
And I could not' keep such an
important piece of news from old Cole.
How do you suppose I could write a letter
without mentioning you, when I think of
nothing else 1 '

You will be telling him the colour of
my hair and eyes, and all that nonsense,'
said Phyllida wistfully, * so that he may
know exactly what I am like.'

I might try, darling, but I should never

succeed. How do you suppose I could
put such a dainty little witch on paper ?
The best part of you is what can never be
described. But I shall certainly make an
attempt to let my old friend know what a
pretty young woman Mrs Bernard Fresh-field
is.'

Perhaps  said his wife slowly, and as
if she spoke with a great effort  ' perhaps
Mr Cole will be coming to England soon,
and able to judge for himself

No ; he wont, you conceited girl 
worse luck. I wish he were ; but he says
there is no chance of his return. The
fact is, his services are too valuable, and
they wont let him leave the States. I
expect he will remain there now for the
rest of his days.*

Phyllida heaved a sigh  was it of relief?
and rose demurely from her seat.

I will go upstairs now,' she said, ' and
keep quiet until the Ashleighs come,' and her
husband saw no more of her that morning.

Her spirits appeared so depressed, however,
after this conversation, and experienced
so Httle relief from the bursts of gaiety in
which she had hitherto indulged, that Bernard
became quite anxious on her account,
and beoan to have all sorts of fanciful ideas
on the subject of the change. At one time
he declared Bluemere could not agree with
her. At another that she had not sufficient
excitement, or that she had too much
fatigue and the entertaining of company at
Briarwood exhausted her strength, until
every old woman in the parish was laughing
at the parson's ' fads ' about his pretty
wife. Phyllida herself was the last person
to encourage his alarm. She smiled serenely
whenever it became patent to her, and tried
hard to force a hilarity she did not feel in
order to allay it, but her efforts were too
obvious to have the desired effect, and
Bernard watched her every look and movement
with the greatest concern. At last
her mood changed, apparently as unreasonably

as it had arisen, but whether causeless
or not, sunshine burst forth again at Briar-wood,
and seemed destined to illuminate it
for ever more. It was as if some heavy
oppression had suddenly been lifted off
Phyllida's mind, or some dark cloud cleared
from her brain ; and she commenced to
dance along the path of life like a child
that had but just wakened to the reality
and joy of existence.

Bernard could not account for the happy
change, but he kept the day as a red letter
one in the calendar of his memory. It was
on an afternoon in October, one of those
days we sometimes get at the close of the
year, that are more precious than any in
summer, when the whole land is made
glorious by a sun whose rays enliven without
scorching us, and the rich autumn foliage
beautifies the country with one mass of
colour. Bernard had some important parish
work to look after, and Phyllida had set
forth alone in her little pony chaise, which

she had learnt to manage admirably, to pay
a call upon the Ashlelghs. She had become
a favourite with most of the families
round about Bluemere, and especially with
the one in question. Captain Ashleigh, who
was an old naval officer, could never sufficiently
praise the beauty and amiability
of the rector's wife, and Mrs Ashleigh
thought her one of the sweetest girls of her
acquaintance. So that Bernard was glad
she should go and spend the morning with
them, hoping their society might have the
effect of raising her spirits. His own business
kept him from home till late in the
afternoon, and as he walked up the drive,
on his return to Briarwood, he saw Phyllis
waiting in the porch to receive him.
But could this be the pale, listless girl
he had parted from in the morning ?
Bernard looked at her in astonishment.
Her cheeks were like a damask rose ;
smiles dimpled on her face and shone out
from her eyes.; her little feet danced with

impatience whilst she waited his approach.
Her husband quickened his steps in glad
surprise.

Why, my darling, what is this?" he exclaimed.
' Who has been working miracles
in my absence ? Have you met an old
friend or made a new one ? Or is Captain
Ashleigh a necromancer, and has he been
giving you a dose of the elixir of life ? '

Yes, yes, Berne,' she cried, laughing,
and clapping her hands, * that is it. I found
an old bottle amongst the captain's dusty
books, and drank its contents before I knew
what it was. And you see what it bias
done for me. I am quite well again now,
and mean to live for ever.'

Seriously, I hardly know you,' said
Bernard, as he came up to her ; * my darling,
you look lovelier than ever. I am so glad
you enjoy riding and driving, and that it
agrees with you. You are not the same
girl I put into the pony chaise this morning.'

No, dearest, I am not the same girl,'

she exclaimed, as she pressed against her
husband's side and clunof to him. ' I feel
as if all the world was changed for me,
and I should never feel unhappy or depressed
again. Oh, how wicked I have
been to give way to such feelings, and
when I had you  you, for all my own ! '

It was illness, my Phyllida, that made
you so melancholy. How could you help
it ? ' said Bernard tenderly ; ' but I cannot
tell you how thankful I am for your recovery.
What did the Ashleighs say, love ?
Did they not remark upon these sparkling
eyes and glowing cheeks and 'happy smiles '. '

Bernard, dear, I never saw them. They
had gone out for the day to Westertown.'

Never saw them, child ! What have
you been doing, then, all this time ? '

Not much, I think ; resting myself, and
dreaming and feeling  oh, so happy ! When
I arrived at the Ashleighs, Bernard, the old
butler, asked me to walk in ; he thought
*' Master Edward," as he calls him, was

about the grounds. So as I was rather
tired, I went Into the library, and there  '

What did you do there, PhylHda ? '

Oh, nothing  nothing in particular, onl)-
read the captain's newspapers, and  '

Ah, he Is a rare old fellow for newspapers,
I know, and takes them In from
all parts of the world.'

Yes, yes, Bernard,' interrupted his wife
excitedly, ' and they are very interesting,
and so I sat reading them, and  and  oh,
I am so glad to be back again with you,'
she cried disconnectedly, as she flung herself
into his arms  ' back again here In my
dear, dea home, safe and well with you.
For as I sat in that library, Bernard, a
sudden fright seized me, and I thought,
supposing  supposing  something were to
happen to you whilst I was away, and I
should never see you more  or die before
we met again  and as the thought struck
me, I rushed out to my pony chaise and
jumped in, and drove home as fast as ever

I could. But you had not returned  and It
has seemed hours  weeks  centuries, since
I waited for you here ! Oh, if anything
had happened to prevent our meeting, it
would have been too, too terrible  and
just now ! '

My dearest girl,' said Bernard, ' you are
still too much excited for health. Try and
calm yourself, Phyllida. To think that you
should love me like this is the purest pleasure
I could experience ; but you must not
give way to idle fears. God is above us
all, remember, and my life and yours are
always safe in His hands.' -

Oh yes, Berne, and I will never be so
foolish again  never ! I am all right now,
indeed I am  and so  so happy, you cannot
think.'

She gazed into his face with her sparkling
eyes as she spoke, and he thought he
had never seen her look so beautiful. There
was perfect peace and contentment at Briar-wood
that day, and for many months afterwards,

and Bernard never thought to inquire
more closely Into the reason of so unaccountable
a change in the demeanour of his
wife. That it had changed was all he cared
for. Neither did it seem likely to distress
him again. From the period of her visit
to the Ashleighs' library, a calm happiness
settled down upon the young mistress of
the rectory, and she was an altered being.
The feverish bursts of gaiety with which she
used to startle her husband entirely disappeared
; but they were succeeded by an
equable cheerfulness that was far better
suited to domestic life.

She now sought the society of Laura
Freshfield as eagerly as once she had repulsed
it, and responded with so much
warmth to her overtures of affection, that
the sisters-in-law became devoted friends.
This happy result was followed by a participation
in all Laura's pursuits, either in
the parish or out of it, and before long it
was no unusual occurrence for Bernard, on

entering the house of a sick parishioner,
to find his wife sitting by the bedside and
begging the tedious hours with her reading
or conversation.

The ' parson's bonnie lady ' was soon as
much loved in Bluemere as himself, and
every day her husband's heart seemed to
twine its tendrils faster and closer round
her own.

Meanwhile, there was no more devoted
wife in the country than Phyliida.

Her love for Bernard was so mixed with
reverence and gratitude that she seemed
never to be able to do enough to express
it to him. She loved him more with the
affection a dog bears to its master, than
the wives of the present century think
it dignified to display. There was none
of the overweening pride of power in
Phyllida's manner, although she could
govern her husband by the lifting of her
little finger. On the contrary, she was
humble and low-minded in the extreme.

She would watch his face to see if she
could read his thoughts before he spoke
them, and run to fetch and carry for him
like a little dog, taking a delight in forestalling
the servants, and even his own
wishes.

Bernard would reprove her lovingly for
such undignified behaviour, but she did not
alter it. To wait on him, to obey his
slightest word, and to accompany him
wherever he would take her, seemed to
fill up the measure of her existence.

Of course her conduct could not be
unnoticed at Blue ]\Iount, and even Mrs
Freshfield was compelled to remark that
although she ' was afraid poor Phyllida
did not come of very good blood, there
was no doubt she made Bernard happy,
and that was, after all, the main thing.'

But that is not all, mamma,' Laura
would reply indignantly. ' Phyllida does
almost as much good in the parish as
Berne himself. I don't mean to say she

VOL. II K

carries about a basket like that detestable
Annie Warren ; and why should she, when
she has plenty of people to carry it for
her ? But she takes care that no comfort
for the sick shall ever be wanting from
Briarwood, and she goes and sees them,
and talks to them ; oh, in such a nice way,
just as if they were her equals ! The poor
people about here perfectly adore Phyllida,
mamma. They say she is a " real lady,
without any pride in her ; " and call her
the 'parsons Bonnie wife's and the '' parsons
angel!' and all kinds of pretty names.
And the scarlet fever is very bad over at
Brick Common now you know  the Tanners
lost two of their little ones last week
and Miss Warren has left off visiting
there, but Phyllida goes all the same, and
she sat up a whole night with poor Mrs
Tanner when she was in such distress.
And Berne, although he is very nervous
about her, wont tell her not to go, because
he says she is one of God's angels.

and under His especial care. Isn't that
nice ? '

Mrs Freshfield's answer was somewhat
cautious.

'Well, of course, my dear, it is very
good of your sister-in-law to try and comfort
the poor creatures, and if your brother
does not forbid her to do so, no one else
has the right to interfere. Still, I think
Phyllida might have some consideration for
you and others of her friends, to whom she
is very likely to bring home the infection.'

Laura glanced at her mother somewhat
contemptuously. Was this the fruit of
the religion upon which Mrs Freshfield
had moulded her life for the last sixty
years,  to tremble at the proximity of a
pestilence that, at the worst, according to
her own creed, could only throw open the
fates of that heaven which she believed
she should walk straight into ? The girl,
with all her young life before her, had
no such fear !

You needn't be afraid for me, mamma,'
she answered ; ' but if you think there is
any chance of your catching it, I will goto
Briarwood and stay there until the
danger of infection is past.'

But Mrs Freshfield, whatever her private
opinion, could never have consented to let
the public know that she was not ready
for glory, and so Laura and Phyllida
worked on together, heart and soul, and
spared neither time nor trouble till the
fever had abated, and the little ones were
running about Brick Common again in
their usual health.

RS PINNER had a grievance
a daily and hourly grievance 
and I regret to add that it was
a worldly one, full of envy, malice, and all
uncharitableness. Bernard and Phyllida had
asked her sister, Mrs Penfold, to spend
Christmas at Briarwood, and Mrs Penfold
had accepted the invitation. Mrs Penfold
had actually left Captain Barclay and Miss
Annadale to the tender mercies of Sarah, and
such assistance as was considered necessary,
and come to play at being a fine lady in
Bluemere. To Mrs Pinner, who had never
been invited to do more than dine at the

rectory, the thought of her sister Maria
living in the very bosom of Bernard Fresh-field's
family, and located in the best bedroom,
with amber hangings, was gall and
wormwood, and all the more so because
she dared not confide her jealousy to anyone
but herself.

Her whole comfort consisted in reading
the * Seventh Vial,' and shaking her head
over the delightful conviction that when it
was opened she should be able to hear from
her throne of gold, even above the twanging
of her harp-strings, the frizzling made by
her sister Maria as she wa's tossed like a
pancake from one infuriated demon to another
in the nethermost hell.

To think,' she said to herself, ' that
Maria, who was ever one of the worldly-minded,
leaning to all sorts of gaiety and
carnal pleasures, should be living at Briar-wood
and driving all over the country In a
carriage and pair, with that stuck-up Phyllis
by her side ; whilst. If they ask nie to

dinner, they don't even send the pony chaise
to fetch me. The poor minister must indeed
have been led astray from his duty by that
o-Irl before he would have dreamt of seto



ting up my sister ]Iaria over one of the
elect. And to see the gown she wore to
church last Sunday, too ! Black silk at ten
shillings the yard, If it cost a penny. The
woman must be robbing her employers to
be able to pay for such luxuries. I am
greatly afraid her feet are already set upon
the broad path. And the way in which
Phyllida and she spoke of those disreputable
lodgings at Gatehead before all the servants,
perfectly shocked me ! \\'hat respect can
they entertain for their minister after hearing
such a confession ? I thought I should
have swooned. I must ask Maria to spend
a quiet evening with me, and talk to her
about such things. After all the trouble I
have taken to live amongst these people as
my father's daughter, and one of the Lord's
chosen should live, to have a sister who lets

lodgings come and sit down at my very
door, is too trying ! I must entreat her, if
she has no respect for herself, at least to
have some for me.'

Meanwhile Mrs Penfold (who was not yet
aware of the feelings to which her advent
had given birth in Mrs Pinner's breast) was
enjoying herself, as she had not done for
years past, beneath the hospitable roof of
Briarwood.

Bernard Freshfield had not forgotten
the kind part which his wife's cousin
played at the time of their marriage, and
there was no false shame  in his manly
nature to mar the pleasure with which he
repaid it.

Had Mrs Penfold been a duchess she could
not have been waited on and served more
assiduously than she was at Briarwood ; and
Bernard would have had her take up her
residence there altogether and make it her
home, had she not been too independent to
accept his offer.

Your husband is an angel, my dear,' she
said to PhylHda, 'and you are the very
luckiest girl I ever heard of; but I couldn't
be happy eating another person's bread whilst
I have two hands of my owen to earn it with.
And what would the captain say if he heard
I was going to desert him for good ? Why,
it was with the greatest difficulty I could
feet his leave to come here at all. I was
quite a fortnight coaxing it out of him. x\nd
poor Miss Annadale cried when I left Gate-head,
Phyllida  actually cried; but she is not
quite right in her head, you know, my dear,
so it is excusable on her part. And I should
have been truly sorry to miss seeing you
in your happiness. What a good, dear husband
you have, child, and what an elegant
home ! You are indeed a fortunate creature.
And the cloud you once spoke to me of at
Gatehead, Phyllida  that depressing, uncomfortable
feeling that I told you was so
unnatural  it has all passed away now of
course, my dear, and you are quite happy

and contented,' concluded Mrs Penfold somewhat
curiously.

Phyllida flushed deeply, and for a moment
did not answer. Then she said slowly, 

Yes, cousin Penfold, I am very happy,
and very contented  sometimes I think I
am too happy for It to last  and always
that I am far happier than I deserve. And
if the old depressing thoughts return at times
to damp my pleasure, I put them away, and
hope I am right in doing so. For they
could only make my husband anxious about
me ; and you told me, didn't you, that it
was my deity to bury all the past and begin
a new and better life for the future ? '

I did indeed, my dear, and I meant it.
You have many more luxuries and blessings
than most people, and all you have to dois
to let your heart overflow with thankfulness,
and make dear Mr Freshfield as perfectly
happy as you can. It would be a sin
to rake up old memories that can do no
good, and only infuse bitter into the cup

which Heaven has been o-ood enough to fill
for you.'

Yes, that Is what I thought,' said Phyllis,
with a sigh of relief

I am going to ask you if you will spare
me for this evening,' continued Nlrs Penfold.
My sister Charlotte has written to ask me
to take tea with her, and I don't like to refuse,
as it is some time since we have been alone
together, and she mustn't think I've grown
proud because I'm visiting at Briarwood.'

No ; she shall not do that !' replied Phyllis,
laughing ; ' and so I will send you down
in my little pony chaise, cousin Penfold, and
you can order it to fetch you again at anytime
you like.'

So at six o'clock that evening the pony
chaise deposited Mrs Penfold at the door of
Mrs Pinner, who received her in a purple
merino gown, with a pink ribbon at her throat,
and artificial roses in her cap ; yet looked,
nevertheless, with righteous sorrow at the
plain but rich dress worn by her sister, and

which was one of the numerous presents
showered upon her by her young relations.


I am pleased to receive you In my humble
abode, Maria commenced Mrs Pinner
solemnly,  for I almost feared that the attention
you have been receiving at Briarwood
would make you despise the hospitality of
one who has little to offer you beside the
divine food, which Is provided for all those
who earnestly hunger after it.'

Well, I don't know why you should say
that, Charlotte,' replied Mrs Penfold briskly,
as she laid aside her out-door garments. ' I
have never refused an invitation of yours
yet, that I am aware of; but It is not many
that you have extended to me since I lived
at Gatehead. I supposed you were ashamed
of me because I let lodgings ? '

I cannot say that I consider letting lodgings
a fit occupation for one of our father's
daughters  the daughters of a minister of
the gospel.'

Yes, a Dissenting minister, elected by
his own sect, who held his services In a
barn,' replied Mrs Penfold ; ' but father was
a shoemaker before he turned preacher.
I suppose you haven't forgotten that, sister
Charlotte.'

I have not forgotten what Is due to
myself,' said }>Irs Pinner, bridling ; ' and It
surprises me, Maria, to hear you allude to
poor father's misfortunes in that heartless
manner ! It is the same thing with your
own calling  you speak as openly of your
lodgers and your lodgings as a duchess
would mention her country seat. I do wish
you would have a little consideration for
what / must suffer in the eyes of my friends
by such a confession.'

Well, I am sorry If I have hurt your feelings,
Charlotte, but your friends can't be
worth much if the fact of my poverty makes
any difference to them. Mr Freshest and
Phyllida are not ashamed of It, as you may
plainly see.'

Oh ! the poor minister,' said Mrs Pinner,
tossing her head, ' is completely led by
what his wife says ; and as for Phyllida,
I daresay she has her own reasons for
keeping on good terms with you. She
has not forgotten, doubtless, that, but for
your assistance, she would never have been
married at all.'

I don't know why you should say so,
Charlotte. / had no hand in the matter,
except in accompanying them to the church.
The young people had made up their
minds long before they saw me.'

Mr Freshfield does not' seem to be of
your opinion, Maria. He told me the
other day he owed his wife to you. And
he tries to pay off the debt by making
you handsome presents, if I am not much
mistaken said Mrs Pinner, with a spiteful
glance at her sister's silk dress.

Yes, indeed, he is most generous and
kind to me,' returned Mrs Penfold, 'although
I hope he does not consider that he owes

me anything. He has given me four or
five most handsome dresses (this is one
of them, Charlotte; just feel this silk  it
must have cost a lot of money) and a fur-lined
cloak for the winter, and one of the
most complete writing-tables you ever saw
just the very thing I wanted, and fits
into my recess as if it had been made
for it. Indeed, he has been good enough
to propose that I should take up my residence
altogether at Briarwood and relieve
Phyllida of the troubles of housekeeping ;
but that is an offer I could not accept.'

The minister seems to have a deep
sense of the obligation you have put him
under,' remarked Mrs Pinner sarcastically,
and it is a very handsome return for just
going to church with them. I suppose the
marriage was all right and regular ? '

Why, bless my soul I Charlotte, what a
question to put about our own cousin.
Of course it was. I saw the licence myself;
and as I am one of Pallida's nearest

relations in England, I had a perfect right
(the minister told me) to give her away.'

'Well, there was no one to object toit
If you hadn't. I suppose the girl has
relations in St Domingo, since her parents
lived there, but she never received a letter
while she stayed with me, which I thought
rather peculiar. Has she ever mentioned
anyone to you, either on the father's or
the mother's side } because you may remember
Agnes Summers' people settled In
the West Indies too.'

No, she never has ; and now you mention
the circumstance, It is' peculiar,' replied
Mrs Penfold meditatively.

Now Mrs Pinner, notwithstanding she
professed to know all about Phyllida to the
Bluemere people, and plumed herself considerably
on the fact of her being the rector's
wife, was in reality excessively curious to
find out something more about her cousin's
antecedents, and it was chiefly with that
object that she had asked Mrs Penfold to

take tea with her. She knew that, however
alienated her sister and she had been of late
years, and however stiffly they had met each
other at Briarwood, the familiarity of a close
relationship is not easily dissolved, and that
a cup of tea would probably soon loosen the
string of Maria's tongue. And she was not
mistaken. When the ladies were comfortably
ensconced before the tea equipage, and the
buttered toast had been sent up exactly to
their satisfaction, the conversation became
more sisterly and confidential.

Of course,' observed Mrs Pinner, ' I was
as pleased as yourself that our cousin should
make so good a marriage. We have plenty
of young ladies in Bluemere,  pious, well-trained,
and domestic girls,  and it was a
matter of great surprise when the minister
passed them over in favour of Phyllida
Moss. For though I cannot deny she fills
the position well,  in point of looks and
dress, and so forth,  yet Phyllida has not
yet been ' called Maria, and if you have

VOL. II. L

any remembrance of the teachings of our
estimable parents, or knowledge of the ways
of the elect, you must confess that what I
say is true.'

Phyllida doesn't talk much,' replied kindhearted
Mrs Penfold, ' but she does more
than many ladies in her position would
trouble themselves to do. She is constantly
employed amongst the sick in the parish.
And she is a most devoted wife, Charlotte,
no one can deny that. Mr Freshfield perfectly
adores her.'

'Is it a justifiable thing for a clergyman
to adore a frail mortal creature, or to let his
friends thinks he does so '. Oh, I see a sad
difference in Mr Freshfield since his marriage,
Maria, though I would say so to no
one but yourself. But he is always in a
hurry to get home now, and scarcely ever
has time for a chat or a cup of tea, as he
used to have. And his marrying Phyllida
was a sad blovr at Blue Mount ! I have
that on the very best authority.'

o

Mrs Penfold was about to reply, when
her attention was directed to a figure coming
up the garden path. It was that of Annie
Warren, eager and excited, from a certain
circumstance that had just taken place at
Westertown.

I am afraid you are going to have a
visitor, Charlotte,' she said, ' and that our
conversation will be interrupted

Mrs Pinner glanced from the window.

My dear, it is only Annie Warren, one
of the best creatures in the world, and devoted
to me. You can speak as freely as you
choose before her ; in fact, she is a bosom
friend both at Briarwood and Blue Mount,
and knows as much about Phyllida as we do.'

I could not discuss such private matters
before a stranger,' replied Mrs Penfold.

But Miss Warren's enthusiastic and gushing
manner soon drove this resolution out
of her head. She entered the room evidently
brimful of news, or eager to extract some
information from her hostess.

You dear, dear thing she cried, falling
upon Mrs Pinner's neck,  (Miss Warren had
been rather given to displaying this exuberant
affection for Mrs Pinner lately),  ' I am
so glad to find you have a friend to talk to ;
I was half afraid you were alone this evening.
Your sister, is it ? Oh, I am pleased
to have an opportunity of making her acquaintance.
I might have guessed she was
your sister though, for she has just your
own sweet smile ! I hope you are going
to make a long stay in Bluemere, Mrs
Penfold ? It will be such a treat for dear
Mrs Pinner to have you here. She is
always talking of you, and longing for your
company. Aren't you, dear ? ' concluded
Miss Warren affectionately.

Come, come, you naughty girl,' replied
her hostess, delighted at the small homage
paid her, 'you must take off your hat and
sit down and have a cup of tea with us.
No, not one more kiss. You know it is all
nonsense, and you don't mean it.'

'How unkind!' said Miss Annie, with
a reproachful glance, * when you know you
are my very best friend. Do you think /
would have run away and left you for the
first person who asked me, as somebody
else did ? '

Well, I don't know replied Mrs Pinner,
with unintentional sarcasm. ' If the minister
had been the person, I think you would.'

The minister !' cried Miss Annie, with
ineffable scorn. ' No indeed, Mrs Pinner,
the minister would never have had the
power to tempt me away from any one.
If ever I marry, my husband must be a
man of sense and strength of character,
and not a poor, weak creature like Mr
Freshfield, who can be led by anybody.'

Dear me,' said Mrs Penfold, * you surprise
me, Miss Warren. I have always
considered Mr Freshfield to be a young
man of so much determination and power.'

Miss Annie smiled.

And yet you are staying at Briarwood,

Mrs Penfold ? How blind you must be !
Can't you see how Mrs Bernard leads her
husband by the nose ? His poor dear
mother is quite distressed about it. She
nearly cried when she spoke of them yesterday
afternoon. Oh, you mustn't mind
my speaking so openly, but Mrs Pinner will
tell you that I am quite like one of the
family at Blue Mount, as I used to be ' 
with a deep sigh  ' at the rectory, when
my darling Alice was mistress there.'

'Yes, indeed!' echoed Mrs Pinner; *and
as you ought to be now, my dear, considering
all the trouble you took on their behalf.
Why, this dear girl was nurse and housekeeper,
and everything you may say, Maria,
to the minister's first wife ; and how he can
ever forget it, passes my comprehension.
But there will be a reward laid up for you,
my dear, in the next world.'

I know that, dear Mrs Pinner,' said Miss
Annie modestly ; * but it comes a little hard
sometimes, does it not? However, I have

done my duty  that is my satisfaction ; and
if Mr Freshfield's eyes are blinded to It
now, they may not be so always.'

\ Don't you and Phyllida get on well
together ? ' demanded Mrs Penfold bluntly.

Oh yes, my dear madam ; and it is no
question of getting on well  It is the sad
incontestable fact that dear Mrs Bernard
has not yet heard the voice of grace calling
her into the fold, and the ways and words
of her husband's former friends do not suit
her. It was different with our sweet Alice.
She was truly a child of heaven.'

My cousin seems to take unusual interest
in her husband's parish though. I heard
Mr Freshfield reprove her to-day for going
out in the rain to practise with the church
choir.'

Oh yes, her singing is charming, no
doubt of that  almost too charming, one
might say, for a private lady. Our organist,
Mr Barnes, quite thought Mrs Bernard was
a professional artist when he first heard her.

He said there was a tone about a regularly-trained
voice that was unmistakable. But
(as I told him) that must be quite impossible.'

Quite impossible,' repeated Mrs Penfold
decisively.

A professional artist !  our cousin,' ejaculated
Mrs Pinner. ' Oh dear, what an
awful report to get about the village ! I
hope you checked it at once, Miss Warren ?
It would be the death of poor Mrs Fresh-field
if it reached Blue Mount.'

'Of course I checked it, dear Miss Pinner.
I said how could it be, when Mrs Bernard
came here straight from *St Domingo. I
am afraid the climate had an effect upon
her health, Mrs Penfold  she is not very
strong.'

Not strong ! You surprise me. I considered
she had so vastly improved since her
marriage. She looks blooming to me.'

Ah, she has a nice colour sometimes ;
yes, but these fainting fits are not a good
sign.'

I was not aware that Phyliida was given
to that weakness. Does she faint often ? '

I don't know, but she faints very easily.
I was at Briar wood about two months ago,
at breakfast time  I often run in on business
matters, you know : he likes me to do so 
and Mr Freshfield was in the midst of reading
us one of his letters, when down she
dropped in a swoon, or at least she said it
was one.'

Poor thing ! ' exclaimed Mrs Penfold concernedly
; ' you don't mean to say so ? '

'Yes,' continued Miss Annie, with her
gaze fixed upon her two companions, ' it was
just as he was reading a letter from an old
friend of his, Mr Nelson Cole,'

But not the faintest token of recognition
passed over either lady's face.

It must have been the heat,' observed
Mrs Pinner.

I don't think so,' said Miss Warren ; ' I
fancied it was something in the letter. perhaps
the name was familiar to her. Mrs

Bernard always looks to me as if she had
had trouble.'

Ah, poor dear,' ejaculated Mrs Penfold,
with an ominous shake of the head.

What ! do you know anything about it,
Maria?' demanded Mrs Pinner curiously.

I know Phyllida has had heavy trouble,'
replied her sister, ' because she confided as
much to me in Gatehead. She said her past
weighed terribly upon her mind, and I told
her it was her duty to forget it all as soon
as possible. For what good does it do us
to be always raking up old worries and
fretting ourselves because ,we can't remedy
them ? '

I don't think you were right, Maria. Perhaps
it was the rod of grace designed to
chasten her and keep her low ; we should
be careful how we interfere with the designs
of Providence. But doubtless you meant it
for the best.'

Of course I did. I thought it a pity that
a fine young girl like Phyllida should waste

her life in lamenting things that could never
be undone, especially when there was a goodman
like jNIr Freshfield ready to help her to
forget them.'

 And you have not heard the name of
Nelson Cole before, then ? He is not likely
to be connected in any way with the past
troubles of Mrs Bernard Freshfield ? ' said
Miss Annie inquisitively.

'Not in any way that we know of,
though of course he may have been a
friend of her father's,' replied Mrs Pinner.
We never knew Mr Moss, you must
remember. Our only connection with Mrs
Bernard comes through her mother, and as
we never saw Phyllida till she came to
Bluemere, she may have dozens of friends
and connections of whom we know nothing.'

It is strange you should have heard so
little of her former life. She is not very
communicative,' persisted Miss Warren ; but
at the same time she resolved to say nothing
4of the news she was burnings to reveal.

Since the two old ladles could not assist
her, she was determined they should not
spoil probable sport.

And where have you been to-day ? ' inquired
Mrs Pinner presently, as she glanced
at her visitor s unusually festive attire.

I have been spending the day at Watertown
replied Miss Warren. ' My brother
had business there, and as I wanted to doa
little shopping I accompanied him. And
we dined at the Crown Hotel, and they were
so busy, you can't think.'

Was it market day ? ' asked Mrs Penfold
innocently.

No ; but there are several strangers
staying there, and all their luggage was
piled up in the hall, and I  '

But here Miss Warren stopped short, as
though she could not trust herself to proceed
any further. Presently she went on, 

Is Mrs Bernard at home this evening, Mrs
Penfold ? Do you think I shall be intruding
if I run in to Briarwood for half-an-hour ? *



I know she is at home replied Mrs
Penfold, ' and I should not think, since you
are so intimate with them, that you could
intrude.'

'/ should be surprised if it were possible,
considering all you have done for the
minister and his belongings,' interposed Mrs
Pinner.

Well, then, if you two dear creatures
will excuse me, I will leave you again and
run on there, because I wish especially to
ask Mr Freshfield a question regarding the
schools. Good-night, dear Mrs Pinner, and
to you too, dear Mrs Penfold. I feel that
I shall soon love you almost as dearly as I
do your sister.'

The old ladies bid her good night eagerly,
not feeling sorry that they were to have a
little further conversation in private together,
and Miss Annie Warren went on her way
to Briarwood with the sly, malicious expression
of a cat tracking its prey. It was buta
thread she had found in the chain of

evidence her fancy had woven against Phyllis
Freshfield, but a thread that might lead
into a labyrinth of difficulties for the young
couple at the rectory. On one of the trunks
piled in the hall of the Crown Hotel at
Westertown she had read the name of
Nelson Cole.

CHAPTER VI.

?i0ISS WARREN feared at first
 V/1 "' that she had had her walk for
rfeie? nothing, for the news that
greeted her on arriving at Briarwood
was, that both Mr and Mrs Freshfield
were out. The man-servant, who opened
the door to her, and who dished her as
much as his master did, tried all he could
to prevent her entering the house. He
could not tell where either his master or
mistress had gone, nor when they were
likely to return ; it might be that night, it
might be the next morning ; he was sure
it would be useless her remaining in the

hope of seeing them. But Miss Warren
was persistent In her Inquiries, and at last
excited the Intelligence that Mrs Fresh-field
had been sent for In the middle of
dinner to a young girl who was said to be
dying, and that the parson had received
a letter after her departure, which had compelled
him to spend the night away from
home.

So he had left Bluemere not half-an-hour
before, and ordered the servants to
sit up and await their mistress's return.

'A sick girl!' ejaculated Miss Warren;
that must be Sarah Jeffrey's. No one
else is sick at present In Bluemere. Dying !
Pooh ! nonsense. It's only one of her false
alarms. She always thinks she's dying !
Mrs Freshfield will see through the trick
before she has been there half-an-hour. I
shall sit down till she returns.'

Finding his remonstrances vain, the servant
opened the door of the library, in
which there was a large fire burning, and



ushered Miss Warren to the room. She
ensconced herself in Bernard's own armchair,
and being left alone, fell to wondering
what business had called the parson
away from Bluemere. Could he have heard
of the advent of Nelson Cole and gone to
Westertown to meet him, and if so, would
he brings him back to Briarwood ? As
Miss Annie speculated thus, and let her
black eyes range over each article in the
room, they lighted on a note which lay
conspicuously upon the writing-table. It
was a half-sheet of paper, hastily screwed
into the shape of a billet-doux, and addressed
to Phyllida in pencil  just such a
note in fact as a husband unexpectedly
called from home would leave behind him
for the satisfaction of his wife. Miss Warren
had very few absurd scruples with
regard to the dishonour of prying into the
correspondence of another. She seized the
note with alacrity, and made herself mistress
of its contents.

VOL. II. M

Dearest Phyixida,  I have just received
a letter from my dear old chum
Nelson Cole, who is actually in Westertown.
He was suddenly dispatched to England
on some important business connected with
his employers' firm, and says he cannot
go back without paying us a flying visit
at Briarwood. It is so good of the dear
old fellow. I am oroine to see him at the
Crown Hotel at once, and I shall not be
back again until tomorrow morning  perhaps
not till the afternoon, if there is anything
to detain us there. But then I shall
bring him with rhe, and I am sure you will
welcome him for my sake.  Ever dearest,
your loving husband.'

Miss Warren twisted the note round and
round in her fingers.

I wonder if the servants know why he
was called away ? ' she thought. ' I don't
think Edwards does, because he did not
seem quite sure if he had gone to Wester-town,

or somewhere else. Possibly they are
aware their master left a note for his wife in
the library, but then scraps of paper Hke this
are easily lost or mislaid. It will be nothing
very extraordinary if, when they come to
search for it, they find it is gone. Yes ; I
think I shall be quite safe in destroying it.
If Mr Nelson Cole should prove to have
been a friend of Mrs Bernard's, as well as
of her husband, this note will give her time
to prepare herself for meeting him. She
will be taken ill before tomorrow, and have
to go to bed, or to visit the sea-side, or she
will receive a sudden summons somewhere,
and leave Mr Freshfield to do the honours
of Briarwood alone. / know their nasty,
shabby tricks ; and if ever a w-oman looks
as if she could be up to tricks, it's ]airs Bernard
Freshfield ! So I will just drop this
bit of paper in the fire, and leave my lady
to meet Mr Nelson Cole without any warning
of what is before her.'

She walked up to the fire-place as she

thought thus, and threw the note upon the
burning coals. In another instant it was
reduced to ashes. Then Miss Warren rang
the Library bell, and walked towards the
door.

You may show me out, Edwards,' she
said, as she met the servant. * That girl,
Jeffreys, has evidently deceived poor Mrs
Freshfield Into imagining she Is really 111 !
It Is nearly ten o'clock, and I cannot wait
any longer.'

I said I was afraid it would be no use your
waiting, miss,' replied Edwards, as he preceded
her along the warmed and lighted corridor,
and threw open the portals of Briarwood. Ashe
closed them upon her, he muttered something
not entirely complimentary, to the
effect that he wished it were for the last time.
Miss Annie Warren was thoroughly disliked
in the rectory servants' hall. But
when Phyllida returned nearly an hour, afterwards,
she received a very different sort of
reception. It was not only because she was

their masters wife, that she was waited on
so cheerfully by every dependant in his
household. Her kind words and smiles
repaid her servants for all the trouble they
took for her ; and Edwards opened the door
almost as soon as she touched the bell, whilst
Mrs Garnett appeared in the hall to inquire
if she were cold or tired, and her own maid
stood ready to divest her of her wraps,
and exchange her walking shoes for easy
slippers.

No, I'm not tired at all, thank you,
Mrs Garnett,' she said brightly, in answer
to the housekeeper's inquiries, ' only very
cold. There is a bitter frost to-night.
But I am so glad I went. Poor Sarah is
much worse. Dr Jenkins does not think
she will live till the morning  and she was
fretting so to see me. Where is Mr
Freshfield ? In the library ', '

My master is out, if you please, ma'am,'
interposed Edwards ; ' he had a letter
soon after you started, and was obliged

to go to Westertown ; and he is afraid he
wont be able to get back to-night.'

What a blank fell upon Phyllida's heart
at the intelligence ! She had become soused
to the cheering influence of that dear
sunny face of Bernard's and to the tones
of his voice. The prospect of passing
twelve hours without him appeared terrible.
Her sweet face fell to twice its usual
length.

Out ! ' she repeated. * Gone over to
Westertown, and at this time of night !
What can have taken him there ? '

I don't know I'm sure, ma'am,' replied
Edwards respectfully. ' The master was
in a great hurry, and hardly spoke to any
of us. But I think he left a note or a bit
of writing of some sort for you, ma'am,
leastways I fancy he said so, but it maybe
a mistake of mine ; if not, I conclude,
it must be in the library.'

Oh, of course he would write,' cried
Phyllida confidently, as she ran into the

library and searched on every table for a
paper in her husband's hand ; but she could
find none, for the good reason that, as we
have seen, the note he left for her was resolved
to nothing in the burning fire. 

I can't find it, Edwards,' she said, in a
tone of disappointment.

I'm afraid I must have been mistaken
then, ma'am, for as I said before the master
was in a terrible hurry, and spoke very
rapid-like. But it's nothing bad as has
taken him out, for he said he had had capital
good news ; and he'd be home tomorrow
for certain.'

Ah, well, then, I must be content with
that,' said his mistress, with a half laugh
but she felt a little uneasy nevertheless.
It was so unlike Bernard to leave home
without further explanation than he could
afford to servants. Mrs Penfold's return
was some sort of comfort to Phyllida, and
they sat up late together, suggesting all
sorts of reasons to each other for the parson's

sudden disappearance, but were finally
obliged to separate for the night without
having come to any conclusion, excepting
that they were equally anxious for the
morrow to bring them the solution of the
riddle.

Meanwhile Bernard's capital horses had
carried him quickly to Westertown, and he
was enjoying himself thoroughly in the
company of Nelson Cole, whom he found
hearty and congenial as ever. He had had
a double reason for setting off so speedily to
welcome his old friend. Not only was he
anxious to prove that his feelings were unchanged,
but he felt rather shy at having to
break to him the news that all his grand
resolutions with regard to a second marriage
were broken, and he was already in the
possession of another wife. He thought he
could stand the first looks of astonishment,
and the cynical remarks that were sure to
follow his announcement, better if he were
alone with Nelson Cole than in the presence

of Phyllida. So he had started off, determined
to get it all over that evening, and
bring his friend back to Briarwood the
next day, fully prepared to greet and approve
his choice.

The warm welcome he received as soon
as he had placed his foot inside the ' Crown '
was all that Bernard's heart could desire,
and it was a long time before Nelson Cole
could leave off shaking the hand of the
boy with the monkish, close-shorn face,
whom,' he had acknowledged to himself, ' he
took so deep an interest in.'

And is this really you, Freshfield ? ' he
kept on exclaiming. ' Driven out seven
miles on a winter's night in order that you
may meet an old chum twelve hours earlier !
I am glad of it. It is like yourself, my boy.
It proves that your profession has not
altered your nature, and that you still have
a corner in your heart for the wicked ones
of the earth, and a remembrance of the jolly
old days at Oxford when I used to give you

youngsters suppers at my rooms, and help
you to evade the vigilance of the dons in
the morning. Ha! ha! ha!'

When you used to be the very kindest
and jolliest and most generous friend a
young fellow ever possessed cried Bernard.
No ; may I perish before I forget it  or
you ! You can't think how delighted I was
to receive your letter, Cole ! Your last
spoke so definitely of your remaining in the
States that it was the most joyful surprise
I think if it hadn't been for the servants,
and that they would have thought it undignified
in a parson, I should have jumped
for joy. I know I ran off in such hurry and
confusion, that I don't think they have the
least idea where I have gone to.'

That doesn't matter, my boy ! that's
the best of a man being unshackled by
any ties  he can come and go as he pleases
without asking leave of anybody  in fact,
he is free. And now you are come, you
will stay, Bernard ? You must be my guest

for to-night ; and tomorrow, if it so pleases
you, I will run back with you to Bluemere
and enliven your loneliness with a few days
of my society.'

I hope you will make it a good many
days, my dear old friend,' said Bernard.

I should like it above all things, but
I fear it is impossible. A week must bethe
outside of my visit. I am due at
Liverpool on the loth of next month. But
it is very good to see you, if only for a
week, my son. And how well you are
looking, boy. Not much like a disconsolate
widower, eh ? '

But I thought I told you I was not
disconsolate ! ' replied Bernard sheepishly.

Ah yes, to be sure, you wrote me
the most wonderful letter, all about the
impossibility of your ever marrying again
wasn't that it ? on account of not being
able to find a true soul union. But come,
don't look so foolish about it. You're
quite right, my boy, and the longer you

stick to such principles the better. Looking
out for a soul union may keep you
from worse scrapes, and as you will never
find it, the close of your life will see you
just such another jolly careless bachelor
as I am.'

But  but  perhaps what I told you I
so earnestly desired, Cole, may not be so
entirely out of my reach as you seem to
imagine stammered the parson.

Well, look here, Bernard, we'll discuss
that matter presently  it's too hard a nut
to crack standing. Now, which are you
for, dinner or supper ? '

Neither, thank you. I dined at seven
this evening. In fact we  I had done
dinner when your letter arrived.'

'Just so! well, I have dined myself, so
we agree on that point. You smoke, I
suppose ? '

Oh yes ! That is a habit I cannot persuade
myself to relinquish.'

Why should you '. Is it wrong ? What

can you manage over your pipe. I always
take whisky and water.'

And I will join you, Cole. I like nothing
better.'

All right, my boy.' So the order was
given, and the two men sat down opposite
each other with their pipes in their mouths,
ripe to unbosom themselves of their dearest
secrets. For what letting down her back
hair is said to be to a woman, lighting his
pipe is to a man, and crass ignorance alone
supposes that the difficulty of keeping a
secret is confined to one sex. But for a
few moments they smoked on in silence,
whilst Nelson Cole was thinking into what
a fine fellow young Freshfield had developed
; and Bernard considered in what
words he should introduce the subject of
his marriage, so as to excite the least.
amount of ridicule at the hands of hi:>
friend.

And so you are living in fine style, I
suppose, up at Briarwood ?' remarked Nelson

Cole presently ; ' that was a splendid pair of
cobs you drove over just now.'

Yes, they are considered good horses.
I bought them of Lord Underlie, and I
keep up a very fair establishment. I ottght
to, you know, with my income.'

Two thousand a-year, isn't it, with another
six or seven hundred from the living ?
A very good income indeed for a single man,
Bernard. How do you contrive to spend it
all ? '

Oh, it goes easily enough,' replied the
other with a nervous laugh. ' I keep seven
or eight servants in the house alone, and we
have half-a-dozen horses in the stables, and
my farm is more expense than profit to me.'

What can you want with half-a-dozen
horses ? You can't exercise them all yourself,
and eight servants too ! It's a mistake,
Bernard, my boy, to keep people and animals
eating their heads off, however large your
income may be. You should see the establishment
with which I travel in the States.

One man  one horse ! It makes no difference
to me if I am in New York or a
village. I never exceed it, and it's enough
for anyone in the world

Yes, I quite agree with you, Cole, if 
if  that is, while a man is single. But otherwise
one must keep up a certain establishment
for the sake of one's position in the
county, and  '

Quite true,' interrupted Cole, ' only as
you do not intend to marry again  '

I know I wrote something of the kind
to you  a long time ago though, wasn't it .
but I have been trying to tell you several
times since we met that  that  in fact  I
ant married again, and have been for the
last six months.'

What?' exclaimed Nelson Cole, pushing
back his chair and staring in young Fresh-field's
blushing face, ' what is that you say ?
Married again ! Found the soul union so
speedily ! Satisfied your heart's hungering
after a true mate. O Jupiter ! O Venus !

Why can't you confine your machinations
to us poor mortals who never boasted of our
virtue, and not go turning the parsons upside
down in this worldly fashion ? Is it
possible, Bernard ? Married again ? And
where did you find her, my boy? In a
palace or on a dunghill  clothed in satin
or rags ? Oh, ye gods and little fishes !'
you have upset all my calculations. I came
here prepared to stare at a real live voluntarily
elected monk, and I find nothing but
an ordinary Benedict, henpecked, most probably,
like the remainder of his species.
Married again I I can't believe it ! I must
ring for some more whisky and water. '

Go on laughing at me,' said Bernard.
I quite expected it, and perhaps I deserve
it ; but all the same, Cole, I am very
happy.'

 Of course you are happy, my boy. They
always are happy for the first few months.
Amaryllis retains every virginal charm that
first attracted you to her; until some day

she loses her temper or her figure, or bolts
with your dearest friend. But yo2tr Amaryllis
has servants and carriages and horses
at her command, so perhaps she will behave
herself, at all events till some one richer
than you are spends a summer In Bluemere.'

Don't talk like that  there's a dear
fellow,' replied Bernard gravely, ' or at all
events not of my wife. You don't know
what she is, Cole, or you would not sneer
at my faith In her. And I will not try to
tell you ; you will see her tomorrow, and
be able to judge for yourself.'

I'm no judge of women,' returned Cole
curtly ; ' I have not seen enough of them
to become so ; and I class them all in
one lump as the natural enemies of man.
They stick to him  true ! as the horseleech
sticks to Its victim until every drop
of blood has been drawn from his offspring.
No, I am afraid you would not consider
my opinion worth having, Freshfield. I
don't deny the necessity of women in the

VOL. II. N

world. I am only sorry when I see one
of my friends In their clutches. They are
creatures to be bent to our purposes  not
queens to tyrannise over our fortunes.'

But all that Bernard Freshfield answered
was, 

You have not yet seen my Phyllida.'

What did you say was her name ? '

Her maiden name was Phyllida Moss.
She Is a cousin of one of our oldest residents
In Bluemere.'

You had known the lady a long time,
then ? '

No,' replied Bernard consciously ; 'a very
short time, if you count by weeks.'

'How the deuce should I count?' said
Cole ; ' I suppose she Is handsome ? a pretty
face will lead a man to perdition.'

People tell me she is beautiful, but I
hardly seem to see It. I only know that
she is mine, and that I love her.'

An old story,' grumbled Cole, ' and one
that thousands of fellows have told before.

Only there is' generally a sequel to it.
There generally comes a day when they
wish she belonged to anybody else. Ah,
Bernard, my lad, I'm sorry to find you in
the toils again ; but so long as your wife
doesn't forbid your smoking a pipe and
drinking a glass of whisky and water with
an old friend, you may manage to pull
through life yet.'

Phyllida is not that sort of woman
said Bernard fervently ; ' she leaves me as
absolutely free as I wish to leave her ; and
I am sure, when you have seen her in her
own house, that however little you may
care for her sex, Cole, you will acknowledge
she is all that a woman ought to be.
I married her because I felt her to be so
sweet and lovable, I longed for her daily
companionship and sympathy, and I told
her plainly that I did not wish her to take
any part of the parish duty. Yet I put no
restraint on her actions, and the result is,
that her own sweet, womanly nature has

led her to do more than many who assume
such cares, from the mere sense of right.
She is the angel of Bluemere. There is
not a house that harbours sickness or trouble
but what knows the comfort of Phyllida's
presence. I have seen mothers swooning
over their little one's death-beds in her arms ;
I have seen children die there. I have
watched the looks of gratitude and eager
expectation with which the sick have greeted
her approach. I have heard the blessings
that have been poured out upon her head,
and I have thanked God who, in giving
her to me, has given her also to those
suffering people, who require her perhaps
more than I do. But what she is to me,
Heaven and my own heart alone can tell !
Laugh at me if you will, Cole, I only speak
the truth.'

There was silence between the friends
for some minutes after the young husband's
speech was ended.

I am not going to laugh, Bernard,' said

Cole at length ; * I don't even feel inclined
to do so. I daresay your wife is all that
you believe her to be ; even if she were not,
you are a lucky man to be able to believe
it. But let us understand each other, old
friend. I don't wish to say anything disrespectful
of Mrs Freshfield. She may bean
angel (and in that case you will allow
that, in speaking of women, I do not touch
her) ; but you are right in saying I don't
care for the sex. I have had little reason
to do so ; and much as I love you, I am
not quite sure that I should have volunteered
a visit to Briarwood had I known
you had re-established a mistress there. I
began life with much the same ardour as
you have, my boy. I believed that every
beautiful face I saw was the index of a
nature as beautiful as itself, and I got into
several awkward scrapes in consequence.
But it took some years to break down my
confidence. I went on and on, hoping
against hope, to find the ideal woman I

sighed for, and when I did find her (as I
believed), she turned out worse than the
whole lot put together. Then my eyes
were opened to see the sex as they really
are, and I have been much happier since.
I have left off expecting impossibilities, and
am content to take woman for what she is,
a weaker, more foolish, and rather less moral
specimen of humanity than ourselves ; and
that is not saying much for her.'

Dear Cole,' replied Bernard affectionately,
' you must have been very hard hit
to talk like this. I had no idea you had
ever had anything to do with women.
We always considered you such a regular
Saint Kevin at college.'

Which is as good as saying you didn't
think I was a man ! No, my boy, we
can't do without women in this world 
but we can avoid the error of believing
them to be more than women. You are
still young and  for your age  very fresh !
When you have reached my time of life

you will talk differently. I can only hope
your awakening may not be as bitter as
was mine. And now let us speak of something
more congenial. I am anxious to
take back an English hunter with me to
the States. Can you recommend me to
an honest dealer with a good stud ? '

Bernard sighed. He would have liked
to sit up half the night discussing Phyllida's
virtues with his friend, but he saw that the
subject bored, if it did not annoy him, and
wisely dropped it. He could only hope
that the siofht of his wife's beautiful face,
and the charm of her girlish manner, might
have the effect of winning over Nelson
Cole to his own way of thinking. But
for that he must wait for the morrow.
The next morning he drove his friend over
to the stables of a well-known breeder,
some ten miles distant from Westertown, so
that it was far advanced in the afternoon,
almost dusk, in fact, when he turned his
horses' heads into the Briarwood drive.

His heart was beating rapidly by that
time, for it was the first occasion since his
marriage that he had been absent from
PhylHda for more than an hour or two,
and he was impatient to look upon her
again and to present her to his friend.
As they came in view of the house, which
Nelson Cole admired without stint, Fresh-field
could hear nothing that was said to
him for the eagerness with which his eye
roved over the lawn and garden paths,
to catch a sight of his wife's figure, and
when he saw it, he became childish in his
delight. Cole was just asking him, in
what style of architecture Briarwood Hall
was built, when Phyllida, clad in fur and
velvet, and followed by a rough St Bernard
mastiff" and two or three smaller
dogs, came quickly round the house to
meet them.

'Is it Elizabethan, or of a later period ? '
demanded Cole.

There she is ! There is my wife ! ' exclaimed

Bernard in reply, as he threw thei
reins to his groom and leaped to the ground.
There was no false shame about the
parson. Although the servants and Nelson
Cole were standing by, he took Phyllida in
his arms and kissed her fondly.

How are you, my darling ? Did you
think I was never coming home again ?
Of course you found my note in the library ?
And here is the friend for whom I told you
to prepare a hearty welcome  my dear old
chum, Nelson Cole.'

New caught from the States, madam, at
your service ! ' said Cole himself, as he advanced
to take her hand. But instead of
offering it to him, she fell against her husband
heavily.

Did you trip against a stone, dearest ?
Are you hurt ? ' he exclaimed, as he felt her
weight. But Phyllida was standing straight
again in a moment  straight, steady, and
almost rigid.

I  am  very  glad  to  see  you,' she

articulated In measured tones, as she stretched
out her hand to Nelson Cole.

Bernard was disappointed. He had
spoken so freely of her warmth and geniality
of manner ! Was this the best welcome
she could extend to his oldest friend ?

You know who this is, don't you, Phyllis
? ' he interposed briskly. ' You have
often heard me speak of Nelson Cole, who
has been out in America for the last \
years. It was such a delightful surprise tome
to get his letter yesterday ; but I told
you all that in my note. You found my
note, of course, darling ? '

Phyllida shook her head. Her lips seemed
glued together ; she could not speak.

You didn't find my note ? Silly child,
where did you look for it.'. 1 put it on the
top of my blotting book. But let us come
in to the fire. It is freezing hard again, and
it strikes me we all want thawing. Come
in, Cole, and welcome a thousand times to
Briarwood ! '

He drew his friend's arm through his own
as he spoke, and led him along the lighted
corridor and into the comfortable library,
believing his wife to be by his side. But
when they turned into the room he found
she had escaped him. To his surprise, and
somewhat to his mortification, his beautiful
Phyllida, whom he was just going to show
off with so much pride to his companion, had
eluded his vigilance and slipped upstairs to
the bedroom.

'Why, where's Mrs Freshfield?' he demanded
of Edwards, who had followed them
in to turn up the lamps.

I think my mistress has gone upstairs,
sir, to remove her walking things,' replied
the servant.

How provoking,' said Bernard, ' I wanted
to Introduce you to her, Cole ; you couldn't
see what she was like in that half hVht 
you would have fraternised over this ruddy
fire.'

Never mind,' said the other cynically,

as he warmed his hands. ' Mrs Freshfield
has been good enough to leave us the fire.
And I shall have the extra pleasure of seeing
her en grande toilette at dinner. Women
are never happy without their war paint ! '

 Phyllida need not have had any scruples
on that score. She looks well in anything,'
replied Bernard, in rather a vexed tone ; but
Nelson Cole began to praise his house and
furniture, and he was soon thinking of
something else. Meanwhile Phyllida, with
a face of the hue of marble and limbs that
felt turned to stone, had dragged her way
up to her own room and locked the door
against intruders. She must have time, she
thought, to breathe, to consider, to plan.
What was best to be done ? Her first idea
was (as Miss Annie Warren had anticipated)
that she would run away ; that she could
not wait there to encounter Nelson Cole
again ; that it would be utterly impossible
for her to go down to the dining-room and
sit opposite to him at table under the full

blaze of the lamps, with his keen searching
eyes fixed upon her face.

As she half-sat, half-leaned upon her bed
in the dusky twilight, with her hands clasping
her head, and a strong shudder of fear
and apprehension pervading her frame, a
sickening scene, which she tried to shut out
in vain, rose before her mental vision,  a
scene of olare and ores  of crashing instruments
and clamorous voices  a sensation
of having done something wrong without
being able to prevent it, and then of failing
limbs and bitter insult, and a sudden
dismissal into the dark frosty night  of
disgrace, humiliation, and ruin !

Who was it that had undergone such
things ? Had any one told her the story
of a poor girl thus tempted and fallen, in
some remote age and clime, and which she
had nearly forgotten until now ?

Phyllida passed her hand wonderingly
over her velvet and sable costume, and
half smiled in a sickly, nervous manner to

think she was so foolish as to Imagine anyone
could believe it possible that such a
girl had any connection with herself.

But then returned the agonising commonplace
thought, that she must go down
to dinner, that there was no escape from that
ordeal, and all the fearful struggle with
self had to be fought over again.

How she wished she could run away till
Mr Cole had left Briarwood, or He In bed
and pretend to be '111 ; but that was nonsense.
She knew that she couldn't runaway
nor lie in bed  it was impossible ;
the deception would be too transparent not
to be seen through at once ; and if suspicion
existed, it would make it stronger.
There was only one thing to be done  she
must stand to her ground and brave it
out!

Yes ; that was her only plan  she must
brave it out. There was still a chance that
Mr Cole might not recognise her. She
must have changed very much since that

time. Every one said her happiness had
improved her looks ; she was stouter and
rosier than in the old days, and her hair
- was not the same colour. The effects of
the golden dye had now completely disappeared,
and she wore it in a different
fashion. If she were only bold and confident,
all would go well.

No one would dare to tell the wife of
Bernard Freshfield that he had seen her 
where ? but this idea  overwhelmed Phyllis.
Love for Bernard, pity for herself,
and shame for the humiliating past swept
like a tempest over her mind, and drove
her beside herself.

Oh ! why did I ever do it ? ' she moaned ;
why did I consent to marry him ? I
tried so hard to make him see me as I am,
but he was blind and deaf to everything
but his love for me. Oh, that noble,
generous love ! Am I doomed to be
more guilty than I have ever been before,
in uprooting and blighting it for the second

time ? Bernard, Bernard ! I wish I had
died before we met ! I wish I may die
now, with the memory of your loving,
trusting face upon my mind, rather than
hive to see it changed to scorn and loathing
! Why  why could I not have found
some way out of the difficulty, except by
pulling him down to share my dishonour ?
Oh, husband, I never loved you so dearly
as I do in this hour of dread that I may
live to part with you ! '

As she thought thus  moaning, weeping,
and rocking herself to and fro upon the
bed, Phyllida was startled by hearing Bernard's
voice outside the doer.

Let me in, my darling ! I want to
speak to you.'

Oh, Berne ! I shall be ready soon,'
she cried, in stifled tones ; ' I am very
busy  cannot you wait till I go downstairs
? '

Be quick, then ; it is nearly dinner time.
But what are you doing, child ? Anne

says she has been waiting to hear your
bell for the last half-hour.'

Making myself beautiful,' replied the girl,
with an hysterical laugh ; ' you know I am
determined to make a conquest of Mr Cole.'
'I don't think you will find much difficulty,
though he is such an old cynic. But
don't keep us waiting, my darling ; I amas
hungry as a hunter.'

He laughed merrily as he turned into
his dressing-room, and she leaped off the
bed and lighted the candles on her toilet
table. Her cheeks were white, her eyes
were red and swollen ; her whole face bore
evident signs of strong emotion. ' This
will never do,' she said with a sort of
desperation to herself; 'this is not the
way to brave it out. My craven looks
would disgrace a whipped school girl.'
Then she plunged her face in cold water,
and used sundry means to restore her
features to their usual appearance, before
she rang the bell for her maid.

VOL. II. o

Put on my prettiest dress to-night,
Anne,' she said, with affected gaiety, as
the servant entered, * for the master wants
me to look my very best.'

*Will you wear the white cashmere, or
the silk, ma'am ? ' demanded Anne.

The cashmere, and the gold fillet
through my hair. Twist it up as tight
as you can, please. I don't like to feel it
falling about my face. There. That will
do ! I am afraid I look rather pale this
evening. The cold weather has set in so
suddenly, I feel chilled  and poor Sarah
Jeffrey's death this afternoon quite upset
me. I know Mr Freshfield will stare at
my eyes ; the frost has made them red 
but I can't help it. Thanks ; that is quite
sufficient, and the sooner I get down to
the fire the better.'

Thus, talking rapidly in order to avoid
her own thoughts, and anxious to rush at
once into the thick of the battle, lest delay
should bring hesitation or cowardice in its

train, Phyllida gathered her creamy skirts
about her, and almost ran down to the
library, expecting without doubt to find her
husband there. But when she had entered
the room, beyond retreat she discovered
Its sole occupant to be Nelson Cole, who,
leaving his warm corner by the fireside,
advanced to meet his hostess. His first
impression of her was certainly a favourable
one. He had done no more than catch
the outline of a graceful fissure in the dusky
afternoon ; but here, beneath the lamplight,
stood a woman whom he decided at once
to be a sufficient excuse for any folly on
the part of Bernard Freshfield. Like some
dainty creature stepped out of an old
picture she stood before him, and as his
glance travelled from the folds of her
soft cllnorlnof dress to the fair face set In Its
framework of chesnut hair and the starry
eyes that beamed with a half-anxious half-frightened
look, Nelson Cole confessed to
himself that he had seldom seen a prettier

woman. Yet in the first blush of their
meeting, something in her features or expression
startled him ; some remembrance
connected with her, returned again and
again to puzzle his brain, and his answers
to her questions betrayed more inattention
than they should have done from a gentleman
visitor to so fair a hostess. Her
manner too struck him with surprise. It
was more than timid or hesitating, it was
positively nervous, and except for her
manner, his eyes might not have been so
constantly attracted to her features.

Oh ! ' she exclaimed with a gasp as she
caught sight of him, ' I thought Bernard
was here ! I am sure he came
down long ago.'

I have not seen him since he went to
dress, Mrs Freshfield,' replied Nelson
Cole, as he scrutinised her closely ; ' but I
daresay he will soon make his appearance.
Will you not take this seat by the fire ? '
 No, thank you, I prefer to sit here,'

o

she said, sinking down on a chair in the
background. * Have you seen my cousin,
Mrs Penfold ? She is here, you know.
My cousin with whom I used to Hve  at
least I lived more with Mrs Pinner than
with Mrs Penfold ; but they're both my
cousins, you know, and they knew my
mother when she was a child.'

Nelson Cole began to think Mrs Bernard
Freshfield must be a little ' cracked.'
What the deuce,' he thought to himself,
does she suppose I care about Pinners
or Tenfold. If this is Bernard's idea of a
companion, Heaven help him!'

But Phyllida, unabashed by his want of
reciprocity, went on rapidly, and in a jerky
manner, 

You have never been here before, have
you ? No, of course not ; but we all
think it very pretty  Bluemere, you know ;
but then we live here, you see, and that
makes a difference. But you don't live in
England, do you ? '

 No ; and I don't wish to do so. I
don't like it,' replied Cole, with his usual
curtness.

Oh, here is cousin Penfold !' cried Phyllis,
as the door opened to admit that lady
and her husband, and Bernard too.

Oh, Berne, where have you been ? I
thought you would have been down ages ago !
It is very cold, isn't it 1 Mr Cole says he
doesn't like England  only fancy! Cousin
Penfold, can't you come nearer the fire ?'

Nelson Cole began to think his friend had
married a great simpleton. But one fact did
not escape his notice. (What did escape it ?)
After her husband's entrance, and when he
had ensconced himself in the chair next her
own, Phyllida sunk into silence. Bernard
occasionally addressed an observation to her,
and Mrs Penfold made one or two commonplace
remarks ; but Phyllida neither spoke
nor moved. She sat in the shadow, dumb
and motionless, only once or twice Cole
thought he could detect her rapid breathing.

Why is that ?' he pondered ; ' she is
evidently not a chatterton by nature.
What made her run on in that absurd
fashion when she found herself alone with
me?'

This speculation made him examine her
more closely when they were seated next
each other at the dinner-table, and he had
the opportunity of doing so without being
obtrusive. Yet his eyes wandered so constantly
her way, with a thoughtful, meditative
look in them, that Bernard observed the
evident attraction Phyllida possessed for his
friend, and began to rally him on it.

When you've quite finished looking at
my wife, Cole,' he said, laughingly, * I want
you to try this Madeira, which competent
judges have pronounced to be of first quality.'

Phyllida reddened like a rose, and Nelson
Cole became apologetic.

I trust I have not been guilty of a rudeness,'
he replied; 'but Mrs Freshfield's face
reminds me so powerfully of one I knew long

ago, that it is difficult for me to refrain looking
at her. The likeness is surprising. It
quite puzzles me.'

I did not think there were two faces like
my wife's in the world,' exclaimed Bernard ;
who was the lady, Cole, and where did you
meet her ?'

Very far from here ; and in a place of
which Mrs Freshfield has probably only
heard the name  the city of Chicago, in
America ! She was  '

But at this juncture Phyllida completely
lost her presence of mind.

It was not me,' she cried excitedly. * How
should it be ? I don't know her ; I never
saw the place ; I have never been out of
England in my life.'

In her hurry and agonising fear, she
completely forgot before whom she was
speaking, and her agitated tones filled her
hearers with surprise. Bernard looked
across the table with open eyes, and Mrs
Penfold commenced a mild remonstrance, 

My dear Phyllida, what are you talking
about? Never been out of Enfant in
your life, my dear, when you were brought
up in the West Indies!'

'Oh yes, the West Indies, of course,'
replied the girl with a scared look ; ' but
I meant I hadn't been in America. Why
should I have been ? What should take
me there ? '

I should have thought from your accent
you were an American,' remarked Mr Cole
drily.

Her father was,' interposed Bernard,
and I fancy she must have caught her
accent from him. But Phyllida is not at all
herself this evening. I am afraid you are
not well, my darling. Have you been
doing too much in my absence . '

She has been at that girl Jeffrey's
death-bed all the afternoon,' said Mrs
Penfold, ' and I think it has tried her
nerves. It's not good for a young person
to be always seeing such sights, Mr Fresh-field,

and I do not think Phyllida is strong
enough for it.'

She is always considering others before
herself,' replied Bernard, smiling at his wife.
But Phyllida did not smile in return. She
sat with her eyes downcast, flushed, palpitating,
and silent. And Nelson Cole's gaze
still continued, every now and then, to
travel her way, and watch each change in
the expression of her countenance. Bernard
Freshfield took the greater part of
the conversation on himself, and talked
fluently on all subjects connected with his
private and professional life. When the
dessert was on the table, and they were
comparatively speaking alone. Nelson Cole
started the subject of drunkenness, and
asked if that vice was prevalent in Blue-mere.


'No, I am thankful to say it is not,'
replied Bernard Freshfield, * for, in my
opinion, it is the most degrading that can
attack mankind ; and I really don't know

how I should cope with it. You can
reason with men on their other fogies,
but a drunkard is neither open to reason
nor amenable to kindness. It is the most
obstinate and the most disheartening weakness
one can be called upon to try and
remedy. Thank heaven, my people are
very little addicted to it ! '

We see an immense deal of it in the
States,' said Cole ; ' in fact, a man who
refuses to "liquor up" on the score of
morality or prudence, is thought very meanly
of, and the youngest lads are ashamed to
refuse to drink ! Even women are not
entirely free from the disgusting habit.'

I suppose it must appear incredible to
you, Mrs Freshfield,' he continued, addressing
himself particularly to Phyllida, ' living
in an atmosphere of purity and virtue,
that a ivoynaii could even lower herself
sufficiently as to become intoxicated ; but
it is not an unfrequent occurrence. I
saw once in Chicago  the very place 1

was speaking to you of  a beautiful girl
younger than yourself (and may I say,
almost as fair) in a state of helpless inebriation
on the public stage, and  '

But at this juncture he was interrupted
by Phyllida rising hastily from her chair.

I am ill,' she gasped, with leaden-coloured
lips. ' Bernard, I cannot stay here any
longer. Let me go to my room,' and
without another glance at her visitor she
staggered to the door, followed by Mrs
Penfold.

See to her ; call me if I am wanted,'
said Bernard anxiously to the latter lady,
as he held the door open for them to pass
out, and then he returned to his seat at the
table with a perturbed countenance, and
pushed the wine across to his friend
moodily.

'Is Mrs Freshfield often attacked like
this ?' demanded Nelson Cole, as he cracked
a walnut.

'No, it is most unusual. I am quite

alarmed lest she should be going to be 111 ;
she is generally so well and active, and so
full of conversation. She is the very light
and life of my home,' said poor Bernard with
a sigh.

Strange that she should relapse so suddenly
remarked Cole. ' I hope it is not
my ugly presence that has brought the
change? '

My dear old chum, how can you speak
so ? We took her rather by surprise this
afternoon ; but Phyllida is as glad to see you
as I am. I can answer for that.'

'Humph!' ejaculated Nelson Cole, and
then after a pause he asked, ' where did you
say you met her ? '

Where did I meet my wife ? In Blue-mere.
She came on a visit to her cousin
Mrs Pinner.'

And where did she come from ? '
St Domingo, I believe. Her family
were residents there before her birth.'
Nelson Cole started.

St Domingo ! I know the place as well
as I do myself; bad cess to it, and I ought
to know her family. How were they
called ? '

Moss. Her mother was married for the
second time to a Mr Moss.'

What was her name before that ? '

I do not know.'

Are you acquainted with the father ? '
No.'

Nor any of the relations ? '

How should I be, when I tell you the''
are all in St Domingo,' replied Bernard
rather testily. ' I know none of them except
her two cousins, and had I known only
herself that would have been enough forme.'


Naturally, my dear boy. Relations are
only a nuisance ; but it is strange I never
heard the name of Moss in St Domingo.
I knew every one there.'

Well, it's evident you didn't know Jmn'
returned Bernard, * and it's of little consequence

either, as both her parents are
dead.'

And Moss was an American, you say ? '
I believe so.'

I expect he was raised up San Francisco
way.'

How can you tell ?'

By Mrs Freshfield's accent. It has the
true Californian ring in it. You can tell
a man's State by the twang of his tongue
in America.'

Ah, / am not so learned,' said Fresh-field,
in a tone of annoyance.

Of course not. It is strange how your
wife reminds me of the face I mentioned,
and the more I look at her, the greater
resemblance I see between them.'

I did not think there were two such
lovely women in the world,' replied the
husband proudly.

'You were right. No more did I. And
Mrs Freshfield's eyes are very remarkable
ones, you will observe, for colour and size

and expression. You seldom meet brown
eyes wide so plalndve a look in diem.'

Like the eyes of a hunted deer, we
have often remarked it,' said Bernard.

I should like to see her and my little
Chicago friend side by side,' continued
Nelson Cole ; ' they might run in a curricle
together.'

/ shouldn't,' laughed the other ; ' one
has been enough to upset my peace of
mind. I don't know what would become
of me between two of them.'

When the gentlemen returned to the
library, Mrs Penfold met them with a request
that Bernard would go upstairs and
wish his wife good-night at once, as she
had been very hysterical, and wished to
take a composing draught. So the husband
left the apartment, and Nelson Cole
found himself tete-astute with the old lady.

 I trust Mrs Freshfield is not really ill,'
he commenced politely.

I hope not, sir, but I really do not

know what is the matter with her. She
appeared almost delirious to me just now
from the rambling way in which she talked.'

She will doubtless feel the cold very
much this winter. I believe she came here
straight from the West Indies.'

'Yes, I believe she did.'

She has not visited America, then ?
I should have thought from her accent she
was fresh from the country.'

I have never heard her mention it, but
then you see, sir, we knew nothing of our
cousin before she came to England last
June, and she has never been very communicative
since. I have heard my sister
say that, from one or tv.'o words Phyllida
dropped, she fancied she had travelled
farther than she cared to tell ; but it was
no business of ours, nor of any particular
interest either. And 1 should think that
a gentleman, newly come from the country
like yourself, would be a better judge than
either of us.'

VOL. II. r

Yes. Were it not that Mrs Freshfield
denies having been in the United States, I
should certainly have said I had met her
there. She has a striking face and figure,
not easily forgotten. I never saw so close
a resemblance between two people in my
life.'

He went to bed, still puzzled and uncertain,
turning over and over in his mind every
reminiscence he retained of that time, yet
unable to satisfy himself entirely on the
subject, until, as he lay pondering over it
all with himself, he suddenly jumped up
and exclaimed aloud, 

I have it ! I know what has caused
this confusion in my mind. She has altered
the colour of her hair. The golden wig has
disappeared, vice a more clerical hue, and
has set all my wits wool-gathering in consequence.
But I am pretty certain now,
and one more link In the chain will settle
my last doubt.'

He went to his despatch box as he spoke,

and drew thence from a secret drawer a
small piece of folded paper.

I will give Mrs Freshfield my little
souvenir to look at,' he said. ' Her husband
affirms that she is very sympathetic. The
sad story of Stephanie Harcourt will be
sure to appeal to her benevolent nature.'

He went back and lay down again on
his bed, but he had no further sleep until
the morning. At breakfast he was told that
Mrs Freshfield had passed a very restless
night, and was not well enough to come
downstairs. He received the intelligence
with perfect stolidity,  indeed he had quite
expected it,  and would not have been surprised
had he been told that her illness had
turned out so dangerous she had been
obliged to go away altogether. Women he
believed to be endowed (in common with
the lower animals) with any amount of instinctive
cunning, in order to avoid danger.
He smiled inwardly when he heard the news,
and concluded that he had seen the last of

Mrs Bernard Freshfield, at all events for
this visit.

But he was mistaken. Phyllida was only
trying to recruit her shaken nerves. She
was shocked and horrified when she remembered
how she had betrayed herself the
evening before, and all her desire now was
to remove the impression she must have
made upon the mind of Nelson Cole. She
promised herself, during those hours of solitude,
that she would really be brave this
time, and hear all her husband's friend might
have to say to her without even changing
countenance. She would listen to his story
of the drunken actress at Chicago, and ask
him what name she went by, and commiserate
her sad fate, and say openly that she
wished she could find her out and be her
friend. She went downstairs at luncheon
time full of these grand resolutions, and she
trembled like an aspen leaf at the first sight
of the man who held her destiny in his
hands. It was some little while before

Nelson Cole could contrive to speak to her
alone, but at last the opportunity occurred.
Bernard was called out to baptise a newborn
child, and particularly begged his wife
not to leave the house during his absence.

It is far too chilly, my love,' he said,
and you will make yourself ill again.
Stay by the fire with Cole and let him see
that I have not overrated my wife's
powers of conversation. I shall not begone
long.'

How little he dreamed what would
happen during that temporary absence !

Phyllida stood where he had left her,
before the fire, with one foot upon the
fender. She was looking into the burning
coals ; but as the hall-door slammed
behind Bernard, she felt that her companion's
eyes were fixed upon her, and
in another moment his voice sounded in
her ear.

Mrs Freshfield, your husband tells me
you have a superabundance of sympathy

for those who suffer! Will you read these
few lines and tell me what you think of
the writer ? '

He placed a paper in her hands as he
spoke, and she unfolded it mechanically,
and gazed at its contents.

What is this ? ' she asked, in an awed
tone.

Cannot you see ? Are you shortsighted
? It is a wedding-ring. It was
given me by the person who wrote the
letter.'

She looked at the worn circle of gold
long and earnestly, and large tears
gathered in her eyes.

Are you reading the letter, Mrs Fresh-field
? Have you no curiosity to see what
it says ? *

No. Apparently she had no curiosity.
Nature was the only thing stirring in her
breast just then, and it broke forth in a
cry of pain as she raised her mother's
wedding-ring to her lips.

Even as they touched it, she felt the
grasp of Nelson Cole's hand upon her
arm.

Stephanie Harcourt he said, in a
stern voice, ' what are you doing here ? '

CHAPTER I.

H YLLIDA gazed into the hard,
determined face of Nelson Cole,
and felt that she had nothing to
expect from him. She had anticipated his
accusation. In the solitude of her chamber
she had imagined that just such a moment
might arise when he would turn round and
call her by her theatrical name, and she
had thought she was fully prepared for the
emergency. She had resolved to be so calm

VOL. III. A

and brave, and to return his look with one
of such complete astonishment as to disarm
his suspicion, and leave him more puzzled
than before. But when the time came, all
her resolutions melted into thin air. It is
difficult to keep a brave front before the
truth. Even murderers, with their lives at
stake, are forced by some inward power into
confession. So, instead of staring her accuser
out of countenance and haughtily demanding
if he meant to insult her, Phyllida
steadied herself with one hand against the
library table, and with white lips faltered, 

You will not betray me ? '

Even Nelson Cole was staggered by this
abrupt surrender. He had been certain of
her identity before he placed the packet
with her mother's wedding-ring in her hand ;
but he had expected to have somewhat of a
fight with her, and to bring her to her knees
only through threats of exposure to the
world. And when she gazed up at him with
tearful, pleading eyes, and made that tremulous

prayer for pity, his task became a very
hard one. He was a stern, cynical man, and
he had a mean opinion of her sex ; but he
was not such a stoic as to be able to destroy
all the hopes of such a very pretty woman
without a pang. He took two or three steps
backward In his surprise.

\x.is yourself, then ? ' he ejaculated ; ' and
you confess It ? Upon my soul I can hardly
believe that It Is true. Although I recognised
you in the first hour we met, I
can scarcely believe that any woman Is capable
of such an act of wickedness as this.
Stephanie Harcourt, are you lost to all
sense of decency, or are you mad ? '

'Oh, Mr Cole,' she cried, trembling,
don't speak to me like this. You were
kind to me once before when I was In great
trouble and distress, and I have never forgotten
it. Don't turn altogether against me
now.'

Kind to you before', he repeated in a tone
of contempt. ' What were you before ?

answer me that. Am I to extend the same
leniency that I showed to a second-rate
actress, discharged for misconduct from the
Chicago stage, to the woman I find Having
at Briarwood as the wife of my friend
Bernard Freshfield. How did you come
here ? What devil sent you to Bluemere ?
And how dared you impose upon his credulity
and trust in you ?'

He would marry me she answered,
weeping. ' I tried  oh, so hard !  to make
him see what a bad thing it would be for
him, and how much beneath him I was in
every way ; but he would not listen to
anything I said. He declared his life's
happiness was bound up In me, and so I
gave myself Into his hands to do as he
thought best with.'

Don't talk rubbishy sentiment to me,'
said Nelson Cole brusquely. ' This is a
matter that is not to be mended with any
humbug of that sort. You know that you
are not his wife  that you cannot be  that

you are the wife of that forger In the New
York Tombs.'

Oh no, no ! ' she cried passionately,
clasping her hands together ; ' indeed I am
not. Cortes died in the Tombs three
months ago. I read the news in the New
York Times ; and I know it is true. And
it made me so happy  so very, very happy.
I began a new life from that day.'

Dead, is he ?  and three months ago.
But what difference does that make to you .
You were married to Freshfield six months
ago.'

I know I was ; but surely, sir, you do
not suspect I was not free to marry him ?
I was divorced from Fernan Cortes before
I left the States. I have the papers in
my possession. I had no difficulty in getting
free from a man who was locked up
for two years for forgery.'

Divorced ! ' said Cole contemptuously ;
pulled through by a Chicago attorney ; and
when Freshfield does not even believe in

the legality of a divorce in his ovv'n country,
why, in his eyes, you are no more his wife
now than you are mine.'

Her brown eyes dilated with horror.

*What's she ejaculated. 'He does not
believe in it ?  he would consider it a farce,
a fraud ? Oh, Mr Cole, you cannot think
I knew that ? It is the first moment I
have ever suspected such a thing. Do you
think I would have dragged him down  he,
who has been so noble, so generous, so
loving, to me  to share such a lot as mine
had I not fully believed the past was
done with for ever ? Bernard not think
me free ?  still consider me chained to that
dreadful man, and whilst his kisses were
on my lips ? Oh, my God, how I have
been deceived ! '

'/ should rather say, how poor Fresh-field
has been deceived ! ' replied her companion.
' I am afraid to think what he will
do when he hears that you have never been
his wife.'

Oh, don't say that ! ' exclaimed the girl
in a voice of pain ; 'don't think it. If you
only knew all the love that has passed between
us  the confidence we have exchanged
 the delight we have had in each
other's society  the thanks we have given
to God for our happiness  you would not
say we are not married. What is marriage
but an union of hearts and souls  a mutual
devotion  a tie that no misfortune nor
trouble can unloose ? And this is what
Bernard and I feel for each other. Believe
me, sir, we are true husband and
wife. It would kill me to think we could
ever be otherwise.'

And do you suppose I can let matters
go on in this way, then ?' he asked roughly.

What do you mean ? '

I mean that I came here to find that
you have deceived my best friend ; that you
are still deceiving him ; that he has not the
slightest knowledge of your antecedents nor
your condition, and that if I leave him in

the same deplorable ignorance, I shall prove
myself to be his worst enemy.'

You will not tell him ? ' she screamed ;
you will not tell him of Cortes or my
having been on the stage ? Oh, Mr Cole,
remember he is dead  he can never rise
up to bear witness against me now ; and I
ann Bernard's wife ; indeed, indeed I am ! '

Stephanie Harcourt, if I acceded to your
request, I should become particeps criminis,
and I will not do it. Bernard Fresh-field
must learn the truth  if not from your
lips, from mine.'

Oh, I cannot, I casino tell him,' she
moaned ; ' he has loved me so. You do not
know how he has loved me.'

I know that if he has the noble nature
with which I credit him, that he will pretty
soon u7Ao\ you when he hears how he
ha been deceived. To think of your assurance
in coming to a place like this, and
taking your stand amongst respectable
people, and finishing off by marrying a

parson, beats me altogether. I have always
known that your sex possess the
daring insolence of the devil ; that you will
trample on proprieties, and carry your
creatures with a high hand, such as men
would shrink from assuming ; but I think
your case is worse than any I have ever
heard of.'

As he concluded he advanced suddenly,
and grasped her again by the arm.

'In the name of evil !' he exclaimed,
what made you leave America ? '

She did not resent his rudeness. She
only deprecated it by falling at his feet.

Oh, sir,' she cried, weeping bitterly,
you felt for me once before ; show a little
mercy to me now. I came to England
with the money you sent me.'

(' D  n my folly!' he interposed loudly.)

I came, only desirous to find honest
work, by which to earn my living ; but my
cousin. Pinner, invited me take a month's
rest at Bluemere first, and here it was I

met him. Oh, sir, you do not know, you
cannot tell, the temptation It was to me tolet
him love me. No starvlnof creature with
rich food In sight was ever more sorely
tempted to steal what was not his to take.
But I tried  indeed I did  to prevent his
lowering himself by marrying me. I even
asked him to take me as I was instead  a
lot like that, with such a man as he Is,
would have been too good for me. But
you know his noble nature. He would do
nothlnor less than what was nVht in his
own eyes, and so he married me ; and I
thought  I thought  I hoped,' she went on
sobbing, ' until you came, that, by reason of
his love and goodness, I might live to become,
some day, not all unworthy of him.
Oh, sir, you were my good angel once, and
took me away from all that was degrading
me, and gave me fresh hopes of life. Don't
undo your work now. Don't drag me again
from the heaven you helped me to attain,
back to the misery from which you lifted me.'

Nelson Cole was moved by her appeal.
He felt himself uncomfortably moist about
the eyes, and there vas a husky sensation
in his throat, which made it difficult for him
to answer her. Yet his mind never wavered
from the idea that it had formed of duty.
He loved and respected Bernard Freshfield
more than he cared to acknowledge even to
himself, and he felt that he could not leave
him the dupe of a woman, whose antecedents
rendered her quite unfit to fill the high position
he had placed her in.

So, although he felt very much for Phyllis
 more even than he had done for the
trembling and shame-stricken girl whom he
had visited and succoured in Chicago  he
was firm in his resolution that Bernard
Freshfield must learn the truth respecting
her.

You ask me an impossibility,' he replied.
I am very sorry for the disgrace you have
brought upon yourself ; but you should have
told Freshfield everything from the beginning.

What right had you to conceal the
events of your former life from him ? '

I know I should have done so. I have
suffered for it greatly,' she sobbed, still
kneeling at his feet ; ' but I thought there
Alas no chance of its ever being raked up
again. I hoped it was buried and done
with. I believed that that miserable episode
need never be any more to me than a half-forgotten
nightmare.'

You thought, in fact, that neither I nor
Miss Vavasour, nor any of your Chicago
friends, would ever show their faces in the
mother country ! That was not very astute
of you, Miss Harcourt. But supposing it
had been the case, I think Mr Jack Neville
can tell a few stories about a life even prior
to the one you were leading when we met !
I conclude you have not quite forgotten that
scoundrel Sandie Macpherson, and the Sacramento
Valley business, eh ? '

She rose to her feet then, and confronted
him with a face in which there

J

was no visible feeling but that of indignant
scorn.

I have forgotten nothing  nothing' she
articulated ; ' and above all that, every
trouble I have encountered in this life 
every sin I have committed  has been at
the instigation or command of your sex.
And you, too, are determined to hunt me
down ! I read it in your eye and the tones
of your voice. Let it be so, then. I will
make no further appeal to your pity or your
generosity. Bernard Freshfield shall know
the worst that you can tell him.'

You will not break the news to him
yourself, then ? It will be the better for
you, perhaps. You women have a thousand
little wheedling ways, remember, by which
you can induce a man to believe anything
you choose, and to forgive everything, even
against his calmer judgment ! If you will
tell the man you call your husband the truth
with your own lips, you will probably be able
to persuade him to marry you over again.'

You have refused me your sympathy,
Mr Cole ; you might spare me your sarcasm
! I am only a woman, you know, and
cannot be expected to cope with it. And
I would rather that you conveyed the intelligence
you speak of to your friend. I
don't think it  it  will make him happier,
and there is no need that I should add
more than my necessary share to  his disappointment.'


As Phyllida pronounced, with some
difficulty, the last word, she turned from
him, and with drooping figure and bowed
head, left the room. Nelson Cole looked
after her uneasily.

D  n it all ! ' he thought. ' What am I
to do ? I'd give a thousand dollars not
to have seen her at all ; but having seen
her, I cannot reconcile it to my conscience
to leave that poor boy in ignorance of her
identity ! Why, I should be aiding and
abetting one of the greatest deceptions I
ever heard of. And a parson's wife, too !

It beats everything that ever happened
to me before. But / can't do the job.
I must wait a few days and persuade the
child to do the right thing herself  she
will see on reflection that it is right, and
will do it from love to him  and then
they must slip away quietly somewhere,
and be married over again to satisfy his
scruples. Hang it all ! she is a lovely
creature, and I don't wonder at the boy
going mad over her. And she's got
some good in her too, poor little soul !
and after all she is but a woman ! Well,
well, it's a most unfortunate business,
and I wish I could guess how Bernard
will take it. But at all risks it must be
done.'

And so musing. Nelson Cole, half sorry
for Bernard and half sorry for Phyllida,
but quite believing that however great a
tempest his interference might provoke,
the weather would settle down and be
fair again after a while, walked round to

the stables, and mounting a horse which
Freshfield had ordered to be kept for his
use, rode off, wondering how the poor
Httle girl was bearing it all, and by what
argument he could best induce her to tell
her husband the entire truth. And the
poor little girl ' meanwhile, stunned by
the calamity that had overtaken her, was
walking up and down her own room and
resolving more determinately with every
step, that she would die rather than tell
it. The events of the last six months,
during which she had gradually been
learning to believe herself to be prosperous,
respectable, and beloved, seemed to have
slidden past her like a dissolving view,
and she was once more the disgraced and
unprotected actress of Chicago, who had
broken down in the song of the evening,
and been ignominiously expelled. She
shrank even from her own scrutiny, as infancy
she travelled back to that scene of
humiliation, and felt as if all Bluemere

had been witnesses of It, and she heard their
voices reviling her for having dared to
polite their thresholds with her presence.
She was no longer Mrs Freshfield of
Briarwood  that dignity had been stripped
from her like a stolen garment  she was
Stephanie Harcourt, the burlesque actress,
and the widow of a criminal who had died
in the Chicago gaol. And she, who was
all this and more, had pretended to be the
wife of a good and pure and true-hearted
man, who had believed in her and trusted
her, and endowed her with all his worldly
goods, and given her his mother and his
sister to be her's also.

Tell Bernard ! Go and look Into Bernard's
faithful eyes, and tell him she had
never been his wife !  that she had seduced
him into the commission of a crime that
must be abhorrent to his feelings ; listen
to his reproaches ; hear his exclamations of
surprise and horror ; see his looks of pain !
VOL. in. B

No, no, she could not do it ! she would
die first ; she would throw herself into the
mere, as she had felt prophetically before
all this misery came to pass, that it would
have been best to do.

And neither could she stay whilst Nelson
Cole repeated the story of her disgrace 
that would be almost worse than telling it
herself, like standing In the next room with
bated breath whilst some dreadful operation
was being performed upon one's dearest
friend, unable to help or comfort, because-one
had not the courage to look upon his
inevitable pain. Phyllida told herself Incoherently
that she could neither use the
knife nor see it used. She felt much the
same as Charles the First must have felt
when Lord Strafford went to his death,
guilty to the last degree of the suffering
about to be Inflicted, but powerless to avert
It, and too great a coward to see it put In
execution.

Nelson Cole did not return to Briar wood

till close upon the dinner hour. It was a
raw, foggy afternoon, and riding in the dusk
was not exhilarating exercise, yet he preferred
it to the chance of encountering



Phyllida without the presence of Fresh-field,
and being subjected perhaps to another
series of piteous appeals for mercy. He
had only time to run up to his bedchamber
and change his spattered riding suit
before the second dinner-gong sounded, and
he descended to the hall, where he met
Bernard in evident perturbation.

My dear Cole, I am so annoyed. Fancy,
my wife has actually gone out, after all my
cautions to her, and in this wretched fog.
It is really too bad of my people. She is
so good to them they think she is at their
beck and call. I suppose some old woman
sent up a request for her presence, and
the dear child rushed off at once. But
I must put a stop to it. I wont have
her health sacrificed for the sake of the
parish.'

Nelson Cole looked grave, but all he
answered was, 

'It is, indeed, a foggy afternoon. I could
hardly see an inch before me as I rode
home, and more than once I thought I had
lost my way.'

Imagine Phyllida being exposed to it,'
continued Bernard, in a voice of injury, as
they entered the dining-room together. ' I
do think, Mrs Penfold, you might have
prevented your cousin leaving the house
in such weather.'

Indeed, Mr Freshfield, I am not to
blame. I have been in my own room
ever since luncheon, and have not even set
eyes on Phyllida. I thought she was in
the library with Mr Cole, where I believe
you left her.'

To be sure I did. What did she say
to you about it, Cole ? Have you no
notion where she has gone ? '

Not the slightest, my dear fellow. Mrs
Freshfield and I talked together for perhaps

half-an-hour after you left us, and
then she went up (I imagined) to her
own room. It was not until I found she
had no intention of returning, that I decided
to take a ride. She did not honour
me with any confidences as to her plans
for the afternoon.'

'Well, it is useless saying any more
about it,' replied Bernard, with evident
annoyance. ' So let us think of our dinner.
She is sure to be back before long'*

But the meal that followed was a very
silent one. Bernard was fretting at his
wife's absence. Nelson Cole, knowing what
was in store for his friend, was naturally
grave and thoughtful, and Mrs Penfold
could hardly be very lively all by herself.
So as soon as the dessert appeared, she
rose from table and left the two gentlemen
to entertain each other. Bernard sat silent
for a few moments, then, striking his hand
upon the table, 

I will stop all my wife's visiting and

nursing in the parish from this evening
he said angrily. ' I knew what it would
be if she once began such work. Women
can never do things by halves. She will
end by sacrificing me and her friends, for
her fancied obligations to the poor. She
doesn't go into a single cottage after tonight.
I don't care for this sort of thing,
and I wont stand it.'

Hullo, my boy!' exclaimed Cole, * aren't
you coming it rather strong ? Mrs Fresh-field
may entertain a different opinion from
yours. Women, as you justly say, seldom
do things by halves, even to having their
own way.'

Phyllida is not like the rest of her
sex,' replied Bernard ; ' she is a child for
docility and innocence.'

Are you so sure of that, Freshfield ?
You always speak of your wife as if she
had not an idea of her own ; as if she
had never lived a life apart from yours ;
as if, in fact, she were a nonentity. Now

I don't think she Is. On the contrary, I
find that she has double the amount of
experience of most females of her age.'

Has she been confiding to you the
history of her former life, then ? ' inquired
Bernard jealously, knowing that no such
confidence had ever been reposed in him.
We have been speaking of it certainly,
and I was surprised to find how far Mrs
Freshfield has travelled and how much she
has seen. I told her that she must tell
the same story to you, and she promised
me that she would.'

It seems strange that my wife should
tell you, a perfect stranger, of Incidents
that she has not considered it worth while
to mention to myself. Are you sure she
was not "chaffing" you ? Phylllda Is rather
Inclined to be mischievous when she finds
a good subject to practise on.'

'No, I don't think It was "chaff,"
Bernard. I believe It was sober earnest.
Neither does Mrs Freshfield regard me asa

perfect stranger. We came to the conclusion
this afternoon that we knew a good
deal about each other  in fact, we are not
quite sure that we have not met before.'

Well, it's all high Dutch to me,' said
Bernard pettishly, as he pushed back his
chair from the table, and gazed thoughtfully
into the fire. He did not relish the
idea that his wife  who was so reticent
with himself respecting everything in the
past  should have been confidential with
another man, and became more impatient
than ever for Phyllida's return, that he
might elucidate the seeming mystery. Nelson
Cole, on the other hand, had made his
remarks with the best intentions, hoping by
them in some measure to prepare the
husband's mind for the unhappy news that
should greet him when he met his wife
again. For he had little doubt in his own
mind that Phyllida's absence was due not
to her active benevolence, so much as the
perturbed state of her mind, and pictured

to himself the unfortunate girl wandering
about the plantations or shrubberies in that
dense fog, vainly striving to reconcile herself
to the inevitable, until he wished he
had bitten out his tongue before he had
said the words that had driven her from
her home. They waited for two or three
hours after dinner in vain expectation of
her return, and then Bernard, having questioned
all the servants, came into his friend's
presence with a face the colour of chalk,
and announced his intention of searching
for his wife in the village.

I am getting so alarmed, Cole,' he articulated
with chattering teeth, ' I hardly
know what to do ; but to remain at home
is impossible. Not a soul in the house
saw Phyllida go out, which is very extraordinary,
for the messages from the village
always reach her through Mrs Garnett the
housekeeper. I have ordered my horse,
therefore, and am going to ride over to my
mother's. If she is not there or at Mrs

Pinner's, I shall search for her In Bluemere,
for I cannot allow her to remain out on
such a night as this. Will you excuse my
leaving you, old fellow ? You must know
the state of anxiety I am in.'

Can't I help you, Freshfield ? Let me
have another horse and ride over to Brick
Common. It lies at some distance from
Bluemere, does it not ? '

Oh, she never could have been so mad
as to go out to the Common on foot, Cole.
It is a long way from this, and I doubt if
she could walk it. Besides, it is dangerous
ground down by the mere, and I would not
allow you to traverse it without company.
She must be at Blue Mount, though what
has taken her there is beyond my comprehension.'


His horse came round as he spoke, and
Cole watched him ride off through the fog
with a heavy heart. A sudden fear lest
the unhappy girl had attempted her own life
in the mere had darted through him, and he

felt that In such a case he should hold himself
guilty of her death. He turned back
into the house with a very grave face, and
his spirits were not lightened by Mrs
Penfold's melancholy forebodings.

Do you think It possible anything can
have happened to poor, dear Phyllida, Mr
Cole ? ' she whimpered. ' She has been so
strange and unlike herself, both yesterday
and to-day, that I quite fear the worst. I
told you how she rambled last evening, and
though I gave her a sleeping draught she
talked all night of the most extraordinary
things. And now to run away In this unaccountable
manner, and without saying a
word to anybody. It is really very unusual ;
and If anything happens to her, poor, dear
thing, in consequence, I am sure I shall
never get over It.'

What do you expect to happen to her
returned Cole, in his gruff way, ' unless It is
an attack of bronchitis or influenza ? Thirty
I should imagine, to be a very likely result

of such an act of imprudence on Mrs Fresh-field's
part, and the best thing you can do,
Mrs Penfold, is to see that everything is
prepared ready for your cousin to take a hot
bath as soon as ever she returns home.'

Oh, you are quite right, my dear sir ;
thank you so much for the suggestion,' re-pied
Mrs Penfold. ' I will go and see toit
at once. Of course a hot bath, and just
the least drop of brandy and water to take
inwardly, that will be the very thing for
dear Phyllida, to prevent the injurious effects
of the fog.'

She left him to himself as she concluded,
and Cole was thankful to be so left,
for his anxiety was fast changing into
apprehension. He did not employ himself,
but sat there eagerly listening for the
sound of the horse's hoofs which should brings
back with news of her. They came
at last, and as he entered the hall Cole went
out to meet him.

Well, my boy, and where is she . '

I can't find her,' replied Freshfield
moodily, as he stalked into the library ; * I
have inquired at every house in Bluemere,
but they have seen nothing of her. She
7nust have one to Brick Common. But
it is too bad, too hard of her,' he continued,
leaning his head in his hands ; ' she knows
how dear and precious she is to me, and
might have guessed the alarm I should
feel on her account. Besides, I asked her
not to leave the house ; you heard me,
Gone ? I asked her as plainly as I could
speak not to venture out in this detestable
fog.'

I know you did, but I suppose Mrs
Freshfield imagined it was her duty to go.
Any way, my dear boy, it can't be helped
now, and you must make the best of it. If
your wife is at Brick Common, she will be
safe enough till the morning, and you had
better go to bed and forget this worry in
sleep.'

She must be at Brick Common,' repeated

Bernard, * there Is no other place
for her to be at ; and she will be safe
enough until the morning, as you say.
And yet I don't think I can sleep, Cole,
not being certain where she is, and I'd
rather sit up In the library until I can
start off to look for her again.'

Then I shall sit up with you,' said
Nelson Cole, and the household being dismissed
to their beds, and the horses ordered
for seven o'clock the following morning, the
friends ensconced themselves In two armchairs
opposite each other, and prepared
to hold a vigil until dawn.

Bernard Freshened was
naturally very downcast and disinclined
to talk ; but Nelson
Cole told him so many stories of the
vigorous life in the New World, that he
became deeply interested, and the hours
passed more quickly than either had
anticipated.

'That is the sort of life that would suit
me,' exclaimed Bernard, after Cole had
been giving him an account of the gold
digging in the Sacramento Valley, and
described the lawless set of ruffians by
which it was conducted. ' I should enjoy

above all things the freedom and the
freshness of such an existence, and I may
add, of such a congregation. To do good
to such a population would be a real
triumph to the worker. The truths of
the gospel, where they did take root, would
fall with such tremendous power on the
newly-turned surface of their minds. Such
different work from irindincr the same
tune, day after day and year after year,
to children so accustomed to the piping,
that they refuse to listen, and far less to
dance. Cole, I should like to be a missionary
in Sacramento Valleys

you may think, Freshfield, but I
fancy you would alter your mind when
you had made a trial of it. The specimens
/ have met from Sacramento have not
been promising subjects for conversion, I
can tell you  murderers, gamblers, ruffians,
thieves. There is no description of vice
that does not take ready root in that congenial
soil  a gold-digging encampment.

I have reason to say so, believe me. Some
day I may tell you why.'

Bernard was about to answer, when the
wire of the house-bell grated as though the
handle had been ineffectually pulled. It
was now nearly six o'clock in the morning,
and the sickly, dirty looking dawn, which
succeeds a winter's night, was trying to
struoorle through the holes in the shutters.

'Hark! What was that?' said Cole, as
they started simultaneously to their feet.
A second passed and again the wire grated
audibly, whilst the faintest of tinkles sounded
from the bell.

It is Phyllida,' cried Bernard, as he rushed
into the hall, followed by his friend, and
began hurriedly to undo the fastenings of the
door. But when he threw it open there was
no Phyllida upon the steps, only the figure
of a little lad, not more that eight or ten
years old, whose teeth chattered with the
cold.

'Who are you, and wdiat do you want?'

VOL. III. c

exclaimed Freshfield, as he caught sight of
him.

If you please, sir, I've fringed the letter,
and the teddy said as how you'd give me a
shilling' for bringing' of it, so I didn't wait
longer than I was 'obliged to, cos the teddy
says the sooner ye get it the better, so
mother felled me to run over as soon as
'twas light.'

He fumbled In his dirty pocket as he
spoke, and produced a crumpled envelope.

Where is the lady ? ' exclaimed Bernard
impatiently, as he seized the epistle. ' Where
do you come from ? '

I don't know where she be now ; she
was a going' off in the railway ; but / come
from Westertown. '

Westertown ! ' cried Bernard, staggering
backward.

Come, Freshfield,' said Cole, ' go to the
library and read your letter, whilst I settle
with the lad. I suppose one can scarcely
send him all the way back again without

something to eat, so here's your shilling,
my boy, and you can go down to the
kitchen and sit there till the servants are
about. It wont be long now before they're
stirrings.'

It took him a minute or two to usher the
shivering little wretch to the kitchen premises,
and when he reached the library
again he unbarred and threw back the
shutters in order to give his friend still
further time to overcome whatever shock
might be contained for him in that letter.
But when, at last, he turned to look at
Bernard, he was startled at his appearance.
The young man was standing by
the table, white, rigid and immoveable, as
if he had been turned to stone, with his
eyes fixed upon the paper spread open
before him.

Why, Freshfield, old fellow, what's the
matter now ? ' said Cole cheerfully.

What does this mean ? ' demanded the
other in a hollow tone.

What does what mean ? '

This letter  her letter. Read what she
says to me.'

Nelson Cole took up the paper, and read
the following words : 

Bernard,  By the time this reaches you,
your friend will have told you all he
knows about me ; and you will have
learned how much you have been deceived.
But oh, my darling, don't fret
about it ; I will never disgrace you mores
am going away where you will never
hear of me. Only try to forget everything
about me, excepting that I loved
you very dearly, and had not strength
to do what I ouoht to have done. But
indeed, indeed, I believed myself to be
your wife. Phylltda.'

What does it mea7i f ' again demanded
Bernard Freshfield, as Cole came
to the end of the letter.

It means, my poor boy, that at last she
speaks the truth.'

The truth !  that paper ! Take care what
you are saying, Cole ; the truth that she
disgraced me  that she only believed herself
to be my wife. Why, I married herby
special licence at Gatehead. She must
be mad ; you are all mad to imagine such
a thing.'

Bernard,' said Nelson Cole steadily, ashe
laid his hand on that of his friend,
there is a great blow in store for you.
Bear it like a man.'

Who says I shall not ? Because I ama
parson, do you suppose I am not a man
as good a man as yourself . But she
says you know all about her. What can
you know that she has not told to nne
her husband ? '

Unfortunately, a great deal. I wish it
were not so. I knew her in Chicago, long
before she came to England. I knew
her there upon the stage, as a burlesque

actress, and not as a very prudently behaved
actress. The first time I met her,
Bernard, was under very distressing circumstances
; she had just been dismissed
from her employment for  for  in fact for
intoxication.'

He glanced at the husband's face as he
spoke. It looked as though carved in
marble. Only the eyes glared like two
balls of fire, and the dry lips muttered
harshly the words ' Go 07iJ

Why she came to England after that
I do not know ; but she had no right to
have married you, Bernard, without telling
you the truth. She was a married woman,
who had obtained a divorce from her husband,
and six months ago he was alive in
the New York gaol'

'Ifs a lie r cried the figure by the table ;
and Bernard Freshfield made a sudden lunge
forward, as though he would have struck his
friend. The next moment, however, he had
fallen backward, striking his head against

the steel fender, and lay on the hearth-rug,
silent and immoveable, with the blood oozing
from a cut on the forehead.

Nelson Cole ran upstairs for a sponge and
cold water, and having secured the door
against possible intruders, knelt down beside
the poor young husband, and administered
to him as tenderly as if he himself had been
a woman. So that in a few minutes Bernard
Freshfield, ghastly pale and shivering,
as though he had an ague, staggered to
his feet again, and sank down in an armchair.


There, dear boy, you are better now,'
said Nelson Cole compassionately; 'it's an
ugly truth to swallow, Bernard, and no one
knows it better than myself; but you must
learn to look it in the face, old fellow, and
it will be none the easier for turning your
head the other way.'

It cannot be true !' murmured Fresh-field.


'It is true, my son ! Unhappily there is

not a doubt upon the subject. A year ago,
Phyllida Moss was an actress on the Chicago
stage, under the name of Stephanie Harcourt,
and the wife of a notorious forger and criminal,
called Fernan Cortes, then undergoing
his sentence in the Tombs at New York.
She tells me that she procured a divorce
from Cortes before she left Chicago, and that
he died in the Tombs three months ago ; but
I am afraid that will not be much consolation
to you. A divorce may be obtained in Chicago
for the most trivial reason, and in the.
most irregular fashion. Couples divorce each
other there for incompatibility of temper, or,
as you see, on account of the husband being
arrested, and the evidence of one party only
is necessary to the decree. You must perceive,
therefore, what an irregular proceeding
it must be. When you met Stephanie
Harcourt, she was, according to your own
ideas on the subject, still the wife of Cortes,
and without power to contract another
alliance.'

It cannot be true,' repeated Bernard, ina
confused manner ; * you must be mistaken.
You are thinking of some one else.'

Can't you believe the evidence of her
own letter, Freshfield ? She only discovered
that I had recognised her for certain yesterday
afternoon, and her first act is to leave
her home. Does not that prove to you that
my statement must be correct ? '

You frightened her, perhaps,' replied
Bernard. ' She is not strong, and she
saw no way of coping with your testimony.
I cannot accept a statement that
destroys my life, on the evidence of one
witness alone.'

Will you accept it on the evidence of
two ? ' rejoined Cole. ' Jack Neville, who
travelled with me from New York, is staying
in London. Will you hear what he has
to say on the subject ? '

Who is Jack Neville ?' asked Bernard ina
low voice.

'He is a fellow who has been implicated

in dozens of scrapes, and burned his fingers
more than once ; but a stewing good fellow
for all that, and one whose word you may
trust to the uttermost. I only knew
Stephanie Harcourt in Chicago ; but he
knew her In San Francisco, long before
she went upon the stage. Will you come
up to town with me and interview Jack
with respect to her ? '

How are we to be sure that he will
mean my  my  I would say, how can
we be certain his description applies to
Phyllida '. Two women may singularly
resemble each other.'

True. Take up her photograph, then,
and show it to Jack yourself. I see you
have a very beautiful coloured portrait of
her in the drawing-room, taken in white
satin and pearls. She is hardly likely to
have worn white satin and pearls in Sacramento
Valley. I think if you show that to
Neville, and he recognises it, notwithstanding
its surroundings, to be the same woman

he knew in 'Frisco, you may be satisfied also
as to its identity with Stephanie Harcourt.'

Bernard did not reply, but moved unsteadily
towards the door.

Where are you going, dear boy ? ' asked
Cole.

To London  didn't you say so ?  to see
this Jack Neville.'

But you won't start without your breakfast
surely ? You can't do it, Bernard.
You will drop before you reach Wester-town.
You don't know what a scarecrow
you look.'

Do you suppose I can eat or drink till
I have satisfied my mind upon this subject?
Oh, Cole, I am in hell  a raging, burning,
intolerable hell ! For God's sake, let me
do something, be it only to walk along the
road to Westertown, or I shall destroy
myself  or you ! '

We will start as soon as it is possible to
put the horses into the carriage,' replied
Cole soothingly. ' I am ready to go with

you, Bernard, to the end of the world, only
you don't want all the servants and that old
woman, Mrs Penfold, to guess your business
before it is concluded, do you, old fellow ?
You wouldn't like to think they were running
open-mouthed about the village retailing
it to each boor they met, and making it
out worse than it need be,  eh ? '

The instinctive horror of men, and especially
Englishmen, to have their private
affairs discussed by a party of busybodies
had the desired effect, and Bernard Freshen
sank back in his chair hopeless, but
resigned to follow his friend's advice.

Let me have brandy,' he articulated
faintly, ' and leave me alone. Don't let any
prying fool come in here, Cole, for pity's
sake ! and make all the necessary arrangements
 there's a food fellow ; and tell 
tell them what story you like  only let us
be off as soon as possible ; for this suspense
is killing me.'

It was a difficult task which Bernard had

delegated to him ; but Nelson Cole accomplished
it as diplomatically as was possible.
He told the servants that Mrs Freshfield
had received an urgent summons to the
death-bed of a friend, and that their master
was starting at once to join her. He saw
that they were not taken in by the deception,
but it left them, at least, nothing but
conjecture to feed upon.

With Mrs Penfold he was compelled to
be more explicit. She would naturally have
demanded to hear the names of people and
places  perhaps even have insisted on sharing
the search they were about to make
for her cousin ; therefore he confided to
her the fact that Phyllida's departure was
wrapt in mystery, and that, for her sister's
sake and her own, It would be prudent to
adopt the fable he had invented for the
benefit of the servants' hall.

But even as he advised her, he had little
hope of her adhering to his counsel. The
pld lady's face twitched . with curiosity and

the delight of a mystery ; and he felt that
as soon as their backs were turned, her
tongue would itch until she had confided
it to some one else.

Yet, after all, he thought to himself,
what did it matter ? There was no doubt
in his own mind as to the identity of Phyllis
Moss ; and all the world of Bluemere
must know her story before long. It was
for Bernard alone that his heart bled.
The women might fioht it out between
themselves ; he thought only of his ' monks
boy"* and how best to shield him
from the scandal and trouble that had
come down upon him.

As soon as the hour arrived, he got him
as quickly into the carriage as he could, and
drove him with his own hands to Wester-town
; thence to London, and to the rooms
in the Strand temporarily occupied by Mr
Jack Neville, was, comparatively speaking,
easy work. For many broken hearts and
blasted hopes go travelling about the world,

and pursuing their usual avocations, as
though nothing were the matter with them,
to render the presence of one silent and
abstracted man In a railway carriage any
matter for curiosity to the rest of the passengers.


They found Mr Jack at home, doing the
dolce far niente after a night of debauch 
careless, handsome, and insoitciant, as if he
were still in San Francisco  and lying on
two chairs with a pipe in his mouth.

Wake up, Jack, my boy ! ' was Cole's first
salutation to him. ' My friend here, Bernard
Freshfield, and I have come up to
town on an unpleasant business, and we
want your assistance.'

*What is it?' cried Jack, suddenly becoming
animated ; ' disagreeable, eh ? sorry
to hear it. Is it a robbery, or a forgery, oran
arrest 1 Any way, I'm at your service.'

I knew that before you said it, old chap.
It's something worse than all three put together,
Jack. It's a woman ! '

Jack whistled, but made no further remark,
except asking them if they had
lunched, or if they wouldn't sit down.

Well, we can talk as well sitting as
standing,' replied Cole, taking a chair ; ' but
my friend, here, is rather anxious to see
this business concluded, and so, to tell
the truth, am I. And now, Freshfield, I
think you'd better open fire by producing
that photograph. I wish Jack to take it
from your hands rather than mine.'

Bernard, with a face that had assumed
a stern rather than a sad expression, now
that he was under the scrutiny of a stranger,
produced a parcel which he was carrying,
and which, being untied, revealed an exquisitely
painted photograph of the woman
he had called his wife. He placed it in
silence before Neville.

'Tell us who that is. Jack '. ' said Nelson
Cole.

Jack looked at the portrait a moment,
then clapped his hand upon his thigh.

By George ! it's herself ! ' he exclaimed.
How did you get this ? Where was it
taken ? I wish I had a. cool thou, laid
on the chances of my picking out her face
from that of any other woman in the world.
She was always a little stunner ; and, by
Jove ! how handsome she's grown, and what
a swell she looks ! Rather different from
her appearance after that last night in
Chicago  eh, Cole ? '

Don't talk rubbish,' cried the other, impatiently.
' I asked you to tell me whose
portrait it is.'

'Get out!' returned Jack; 'you know
as well as I do. It's little Nessie Macpherson,
of Sacramento Valley.'

That  that isn't the name you mentioned,'
said Bernard hurriedly, to Nelson
Cole.

No, it isn't ; but it will lead to it.
Tell us where you met Nessie, Jack, and
where she went to, and all you may
know about her ; not for i7iy satisfaction,

VOL. III. D

you understand, but for that of my
friend.'

Oh, certainly, with the greatest pleasure
! ' replied Jack, pushing the portrait
away from him. ' Only look here !  she
hasn't got into a scrape, has she ? You're
not going to ask me to peach upon a
woman ? '

Don't be afraid of that. She has got
into a scrape (or rather she's got my
friend into one) ; but it's nothing in which
the truth can hurt her. So fire away, Jacks
be quick about it'

The three men drew their chairs together,
Bernard sitting between the others,
like the ghost of Banquo at the feast of
Macbeth.

I met Nessie first in San Francisco,'
commenced Neville. * I tried my luck at
the gold diggings there, and her father,
Macpherson, who is one of the greatest
rascals living '  (' The very greatest, d  n
him ! ' interposed Cole)  ' kept a sort of

public house there, which was, in point
of fact, a gambling hell, and Nessie used
to serve at the bar. I think I noticed
her more because she was so young  only
sixteen  to place in such a position than
because she was so pretty. And Sandie
Macpherson ill-treated her into the bargain.
There wasn't a digger in the Valley that
didn't feel for the child.'

Freshfield groaned, but he said nothing.

Go on ; cut it short,' was the practical
remark of Cole.

I got into a scrape up there after a while
one of my numerous awkward jobs, you
know. Cole  and had to run down South
till the breeze had blown over. There was
a nasty fellow there at the time, called
Fernan Cortes, whom none of us liked,
and he was implicated in the affair ; in fact,
/ had had to bear the brunt of his knavery.
Naturally, the first thing I did on my return
was to look up my friend to have it
out with him, but I found he had muzzled





from Sacramento Valley, and taken Nestle
Macpherson with him. The father declared
she was an obstinate hussy, and
would marry Cortes ; but I heard a very
different story from the diggers. They told
me there had been a fight up at Macpherson's
one day with a stranger, who declared
he had been cheated at the tables, and that
Sandie had held him down whilst Cortes
knives him, and Nessie had been witness
to the affair, and threatened to expose it.
So then her father forced her to marry histories
 they can do anything they choose
with a rough disorderly band like that 
and packed her off with him, lest she should
turn witness against them. I'm not sure if
that's the real truth of the matter. I only
tell it you as it was told to me.'

But where did you meet Nessie next,
Jack ? That's the most important thing.'

Why, in Chicago, where she was acting
on the stage under the name of Stephanie
Harcourt.'

You hear that, old fellow,' said Cole to
Bernard ; ' am I right or wrong ? '

Let Mr Neville go on, Cole. I have
no hope left'

I had just come from New York then,
having made the Valley a bit too hot to hold
me again, and Fernan Cortes was arrested
for forgery whilst I was there, and condemned
to two years' imprisonment in the
Tombs. I inquired after his wife in the
city, but I couldn't hear anything of her,
so I was all the more surprised to recognise
her pretty face on the Chicago stage.
Of course I found out her address  I wish
to goodness now that I hadn't  and went
off to carry her the news of her husband's
arrest. I never saw a poor girl so delighted
in my life ; it was as if she had
been condemned to death, and I had been
the bearer of a free pardon. She went
right off her head, and was like a mad
creature. Then I was fool enough to give
her a dinner at one of the swell restaurants

there, and ply her with champagne  without
any idea, of course, except that of keeping
up her spirits, but it proved too much
for her, and she was dismissed from the
theatre that evening. I daresay Cole has
told you that part of the story, Mr Freshfield,
and I need not recapitulate. Nessie left
Chicago, and I have heard nothing of her
since, until you placed her portrait in my hand.
And what the dickens is she doing now ? '

Worse than she ever did in all her life
before, Neville. We owe you some explanation
after giving you all this trouble,
and I know you may be trusted with my
my friend's secret. I knew this girl under
the name of Stephanie Harcourt at Chicago.
I felt interested in her, as I suppose most
men would do if only on account of her
beauty, and when Evans dismissed her from
the theatre I visited her, and sent her
sufficient money to enable her to leave the
city. What was my astonishment, on going
to see my friend Freshfield the other day

at Bluemere  a clergyman, and a man of
property and standing in the county  you
won't credit me, Jack, but it's sacred truth
I'm telling you  what was my amazement
at finding that girl established at Briarwood
as his wife!

Heaven and earth ! ' cried Neville, starting
from his seat. ' What ! Nessie Macpherson,
the daughter of old Sandie, a
parson's wife ? It's impossible.'

'It is possible, my boy, and if I had
died in America, she would have probably
gone on to the end without detection. But
I recognised her at once, and when she
found it was the case, she cut and run.'

Best thing she could do,' remarked Jack
sententiously ; ' she's a nice little thing, but
as for sticking up to be any man's wife,
and a parson's above all men  O Lord  '

Dont! ejaculated Bernard in a voice
of pain ; and then he added in a very gentle
but manly manner, ' Mr Neville, I daresay
I must appear to you in the light only of

a very easily taken in fool ; but you must
remember that this  this lady came to
Bluemere under a feigned name to stay
with respectable people, and I had no
means of ascertaining her antecedents. I
I  loved her and believed in her. Tell
me all therefore that it is necessary I should
know ; but don't say more, at least till I am
gone, for I am scarcely strong enough yet
to bear it.'

There was such bitter unmistakable
suffering imprinted on his features that'
the best part of Jack Neville's nature was
aroused. He held out his hand to Bernard,
with a firm friendly grasp,  

I was thoughtless,' he said, ' and I beg
your pardon. That you have been easily
deceived by her, Mr Freshfield, is no blot
upon your character, it rather redounds to
your credit. I wouldn't give you twopence
for the man whom a pretty woman can't
take in. But I think now I have told you
all that I can about the girl whose portrait

this is, and who is without doubt the
same that I knew under the names of
Nessie Macpherson and Stephanie Harcourt.
And what shall you do now about
it?'

She has left me. I do not believe her
to be my wife. There is nothing left forme
to do except to bear it as best I may,'
said Bernard, in a broken voice.

Shall you return to Bluemere ? ' demanded
Nelson Cole.

Certainly ; because I have suffered a
terrible shock is no reason that my people
should suffer also. My duty lies in Blue-mere.
I had better return at once. And
I carry one consolation with me, my
conscience is at rest ; I have not wronged
her.'

I had better return with you, Bernard,'
said Cole anxiously.

As you will, dear old chum ; but it is
not necessary  in fact I would rather go
alone. I must learn to fight with this

grief that has come so suddenly upon
me, and which is far worse than death.
After a while, perhaps, if I hear nothing,
I will ask you to make some inquiries
for me. She must not want, you know ;
but for the present, I feel stunned and
unable to think. Let me go home at once,
Cole ; I am like a wounded animal, that
wants to get out of the light and die alone.'

All right, Bernard,' replied Cole, ' you
shall do exactly as you think best. After
a few days you shall be better able
to decide for yourself. For the present
I will remain with Neville. To-morrow
or next day, if you wish it, I will rejoin
you at Briarwood, for I shouldn't like to
leave England again, dear boy, without
another shake of the hand from you. And
keep up your pluck, old fellow. Remember
there are as good fish in the sea as any
that came out of it.'

Bernard shook his head with a sad
smile ; but he bade them farewell gratefully,

and walked downstairs again as-miserable
a man as existed in all England.


His friends talked very differently of
Miss Stephanie Harcourt as soon as his
back was turned.

Fine fellow that,' commenced Jack
Neville. ' I like his cut. He's straight asa
rule. I can read it in his eye.'

You'd say so if you knew him,' replied
Cole. * His only fault is being a parson.
That man would as soon shoot his own
mother as do a mean or dishonourable
action. But how he can have been so
green as to be taken in by that little jade
beats me altogether.'

Nessie's awfully pretty,' remonstrated
his companion, ' and when she's well
dressed, she looks a thorough lady. Not
that I often saw her in San 'Frisco.'

Jack, my boy, I never knew, till I
heard you tell the fact to Freshfield, that
you had been such a long time in Sacramento.

You must have known that old
devil Sandie Macpherson for several
years. Did you ever see or hear of a
person named Summers, who was connected
with him there ? '

Summers ! Summers ! ' said Jack reflectively.
' Let me see. Do you mean
a man ? '

No  a woman ! '

Young ? '

No replied Nelson Cole, as curtly as
before, ' middle-aged.'

Why do you want to know ? '

What's that to you, my son ? '

True. However, I don't remember
the name. I knew a lot of women there,
but I can't recall any one of the name of
Summers.'

Nelson Cole smoked in silence for a few
minutes as though he were making up
his mind to some mighty effort  then he
said suddenly, 

Jack, had Macpherson (curse him)

any one living with him whilst you were
there ? '

He had his wife replied Neville
innocently. But he was startled by the
tornado of passion his words roused in
his companion.

Wife!' he exclaimed vehemently
dashing his pipe upon the ground ; ' he
had no wife. He lied if he said so.
The woman who lived with him was only
another of his victims, and rather a more
wronged and helpless victim than the
rest. Macpherson stole her  the cowardly
scoundrel  as he stole the money of men
and their reputations and their lives.'

My dear Cole, don't put yourself Into
such a white heat on the matter. What
was the woman to you ? Did you know
her ? '

Cole paused to wipe the beads of perspiration
from his forehead before he
answered, 

Yes, I did know her  years and years

ago, and I knew her husband too, poor
devil  and what he suffered when she left
him, and I have sworn that, whenever
Sandie Macpherson and I meet face to
face, I will avenge his wrongs. She was
a good and true wife to him, Jack (to my
friend, you understand), until she met
that devil Macpherson, and he led her
astray  the arch fiend alone knows by
what means  for he is one of the ugliest
does that was ever created.'

You may well say that, Cole. He can
never have been handsome at any time,
with his freckled face and red hair, and
what he used to look like in a digger's
costume with a beard to his waist, you
may just imagine. He alway's went by
the name of Sandie the Devil amongst
the diggers, and well he deserved it. But
this woman you speak of. Can it have
been Mrs Moss ?'

'Moss  Moss; that is a coincidence,
Jack. Stephanie Harcourt went by the

name of Phyllida Moss when she came to
England ! It was under that name she
married poor Freshfield.'

Was it ? Well, I conclude she took the
idea from her mother.'

'Was Mrs Moss the mother of Stephanie
? ' asked Cole, with visible agitation.

I have been always told so. But
she is dead, as perhaps you know. She
died when Nessie was fourteen or fifteen
about a year before this iniquitous marriage
was brought about with that brute
Cortes.'

She is dead, is she ? ' said Cole slowly.
Well, if she was the woman I mean, I
am glad to hear it. Dead ! escaped from
his clutches  gone to a more merciful
gaoler. Thank Heaven for her release !
Poor Agnes.'

That was her name, I know,' interposed
Neville. ' I have heard Macpherson call
her by the name of Agnes over andover
again.'

'And what was she like, Jack?' said
Cole eagerly ; ' describe her to me as
well as you can. Let me be sure that it is
my  my  poor friend's wife that lies at
rest at last.'

She was a tall, slight woman  if you
are speaking of Mrs Moss  with dark eyes
and hair  '

Yes, yes ; go on, my lad, go on ! ' cried
the other hastily.

A great quantity of hair that fell down
to her waist, and small hands and feet;
and a French accent, and  '

It was she, without doubt ; it was poor
Agnes whom you knew. But why did
she call herself Moss instead of Macpherson
? '

That I cannot tell you. I thought
perhaps it was because Macpherson himself
was in such evil odour in California,
and so often in scrapes, that she preferred
like some American women  to keep
her maiden name ; and it is quite certain

that Nestle was never styled Macpherson
till after her mother's death. You see
Mrs Moss was a sort of protection to the
girl ; but when she was removed, Sandie
had her entirely in his power, and a nice
use he made of it.'

Did he ill-treat her ? '

Shamefully. The whole Valley was up
in arms about it. For my part, I was not
surprised to hear she had run off with
Cortes ; I should not have been surprised
to hear anything of the girl, she suffered
so much from his violence.'

Poor child ! Well, it will only add
another knot to the lash I have in store
for that gentleman. It is quite in accordance
with the character I have heard of
him that he should ill-treat his own child.
I confess, Neville, that when I met you
after that business in Chicago, and found
that I had been assisting the daughter of
my greatest enemy, I was sorry for it, and
the knowledge of whose child she is made

VOL. III. E

me sterner perhaps with her the other day
than I need have been ; but now that you
tell me she is only another of his victims,
I will try and forget she is his flesh and
blood;

But, my dear fellow, I don't know that
she Is. The general belief in Sacramento
was that Nessie was not Macpherson's
daughter.'

'What do you mean, Neville?' cried
Nelson Cole, starting to his feet ; ' not his
daughter ? Then, whose daughter could
she be ? Was not this Mrs Moss her
mother?'

Oh yes ; there is no doubt of that ; but
I imagined  I may be wrong, you know,
but this was the general Idea  that Mrs
Moss had been married twice, and that
Nessie was her child by the first marriage.
Any way, she was several weeks old, I
believe, when Macpherson brought the
woman he called his wife to Sacramento
; and I have been told by those

who knew him then that he constantly
disclaimed all relationship with Nessie.
Now that you tell me that Mrs Moss
was seduced from her husband by Sandie,
the things is clear enouofh-  Nessie must
be the daughter of the man she 'deserted."


God in heaven ! ' cried Cole. ' Why
did this never strike me before ? '

I wonder it didn't strike Mrs Moss's
husband,' said Jack.

Because, my dear boy, he had left his
wife six months before in New York, whilst
he went down South on business. And
during his absence that reptile Macpherson
used some of his diabolical arts by which
to convince Agnes Summers that her husband
was untrue to her, and she succumbed
(as too many women do)  not to her passion,
but to her desire of retaliation. And
so her husband lost her ; and so he has
gone through the world since, waiting, but
longing, for his revenge. And you really

think that this girl is the child of  of  my
friend ? '

I think it is very probable ; I am sure
the mother thought so, though she brought
up Nessie to look upon Macpherson as her
father ; but perhaps that was to avoid
trouble after her death, for she was a longtime
dying.'

Poor Agnes ! ' murmured Cole thoughtfully,
as he remembered the worn wedding-ring
and the curious fashion in which it had
reached him.'

Cole, did you say you were only waiting
to meet Sandie Macpherson face to
face ? '

It's true, my boy. I've tracked him from
one State to another, but always missed him
by a flash of lightning. He knows we have
a heavy account to settle with each other,
and slips through my fingers like an eel.
But the day will come, Jack ; sooner or later
it must come.'

Perhaps it has come, Cole, for Sandie

the Devil Is in England. I saw his ugly
face  clean shorn, but still his own  only
last night.'

Where ? where ? ' cried Cole, roused into
sudden activity.

He was pushing through a crowd when
I caught sight of him, and I didn't attract
his notice, as you may suppose. That man
is my evil genius, and misfortune has always
followed in his wake for me. So I didn't
stop to shake his dirty hand. But he is in
London, safe and sure.'

Neville, I can't return on the loth. This
matter must be settled before I leave England.
The sleepers start by the King of
the Icebergs, and I shall telegraph to 
at once that business detains me
here for an indefinite period.'

Will it be wise, Cole, to let your friend's
private affairs interfere with your relations
with Farquharson ' '

My connection with the firm, my annual
income, and every prospect I have in life,

may go smash before I will give up this
opportunity of settling old scores with that
scoundrel. Neville, you don't know  it is
impossible to tell you  the bad blood that
is between us ! '

I know one thing,' replied the younger
man, laughing, ' that you are determined to
have a slap at the old hypocrite, and I wish
you all success. If I could help you to
smash him I should be but too glad.'

They don't allow Lynch law in this
country,' said Cole; ' but they'll have to stand
it for once in a way if Sandie Macpherson
and I cross each other's path, and they may
give me six months afterwards if they will,
but I'll have my revenge on him. It would
be cheap at any cost'

And then having made some appointment
with his friend for the evening, Nelson
Cole took his way slowly downstairs with
a mouth that looked as determined as a bulldog's,
and an eye that gleamed with the
softness of a woman's. The one was for

Sandie Macpherson, the other for Phyllida
Moss.

Poor child ! ' he thought, 'poor ill-used
child ! At any rate she is hers, and from
this time forward I will stand her friend.'

O W Bernard Freshfield reached
home that day, he said afterwards
that he never knew. It is supposed
that he travelled by cabs and trains in
the same way that happy mortals (if there
are any) perform their journeys ; but it was
all done mechanically, and he was conscious
but of one thought the while, that he was
alive, and he wished that he could die. He
was a good man ; but it was too soon for
him to become reconciled to such an awful
disappointment  the worst that had ever
befallen him. He could not realise that it
was true  that would have been impossible

but he kept on repeating mentally the Intelligence
that had been conveyed to him by
Jack Neville and Nelson Cole, and wondering
in a dull, stupefied way if they could be
mistaken, and resolving that he would tax
his wife with it, face to face, and then,
waking up with a start, to remember that
she was 710 his wife, and that she was
gone.

Briarwood without Phyllida ! It was incredible
 it would never look like the
same place again  but then that was a
trifle compared to the rest ; sae world would
never look the same to him again, it was
puerile fretting about Briarwood. As he
walked home from Westertown (for he felt
that when he coitld use action it was the
only preservative against his going mad), he
could not help comparing his feelings with
those he experienced on losing his first wife.
He had been very lonely then ; the house
had seemed like an empty mausoleum to
him, and he had never entered the hall for

months afterwards, and encountered the stairs
without recalling how he had watched the
bearers carry Alice's coffin from her bedroom
to the library, and had removed the lid to take
one more look at her pale waxen face before
it was hid away from him for ever. He had
not loved her as he could love, but she had
endeared herself to him, and no man can
lose the woman who has been part of his
life, without the loss being succeeded by a
terrible sense of loneliness. But with the
loneliness, however hard to bear, come rest,
solitude, and silence  three strong friends to
help us to cope with sorrow. In his present
position, Bernard could have no such assistance,
and he felt as if the first he should
never know again, and the other two he
could not bear. If she had only died, he
kept on saying to himself  meaning Phyllida,
of course  died with her hand in his, true
and loving to the last, like his poor, forgotten
Alice, he could have struggled with misfortune.
But to think of her living still.

though lost to him  the wife perhaps of
some other man (since their union was
proved to have been illegal), the thought was
madness  he could not  dare not, think.

There were his people waiting for his
return ; his work amongst them to be punctually
performed. As he strode on through
the gathering darkness (for it was late in
the afternoon) he told himself there was but
one way in which to meet the storm that
had overtaken him, and that was by work 
hard, constant, faithful work  and he would
try no other remedy. He had been careless,
perhaps. The charm of this woman's
society and ways and manners had kept
him too much by her side, and caused him
to neglect his humbler friends. He had
provoked the Almighty to send forth His
thunders and lightnings upon him. In the
freshness of his grief Bernard Freshfield
forgot the heart and essence of the religion
to which he had ever clung ; he overlooked
the ' All-loving'* who had been to him as

an actual fatherly presence, and called Him
the Almighty instead. How much some
women will have to answer for hereafter 
the chanting women especially, who hold
the power of drawing men after them and
detaining them there. A woman has but
too often come between a good man and
his God before Bernard Freshfield's time.
But his nature was too noble to succumb
utterly to such weakness. As he entered
the grounds of Briarwood it struck him, for
the first time, that he should have to give
some explanation of the disappearance of
Phyllida to his friends and servants. He
had been too much absorbed in his own
grief to think of it, and even now it troubled
him but little compared with all the rest.
After all, what was the shame, compared
with the loss ? Only he must spare her
name as much as he possibly could. He let
himself into the house, and walked into the
library. The lamps were burning brightly,
the fire had been well tended ; it was evident

that his servants had expected him home
again. He rung the bell for Mrs Garnett
twice. That was his accustomed signal that
he required her services, and he felt in his
present state of mind that he could better
encounter a woman than a man. The old
housekeeper appeared, prim and spotless
as usual, and without a sign of disturbance
on her countenance.

I am glad to see you home, sir ; I was
beginning to feel uneasy. The days do
close in so soon now. I suppose you will
take your dinner at seven as usual ? '

Yes  no  ' replied Bernard incoherently.
 Dinner, oh yes, of course I will.
I mustn't forget Mrs Penfold. By the
way, that's what I wanted, Mrs Garnett.
Please ask Mrs Penfold to come and speak
to me here.'

But, if you please, sir, she's gone ! '

Gone I Where to ? '

I understood she had gone to, stay with
Mrs Pinner, sir ; at least she packed up her

box and left word for the stable boy to take
it over there on a barren Mrs Penfold was
very curious like and upset in her mind all
the morning, sir. She kept on saying that
she'd better go, and that you wouldn't like
to see her here when you returned, and I
thought, perhaps, there had been a sort of
misunderstanding between you. But it
wasn't my place to say anything, sir, so I
just let her go.'

She must do as she thinks best,' replied
Bernard indifferently, * though there is no
reason why she should not have remained
at Briarwood. Any news from the village,
Mrs Garnett?' he added with a sigh.

Well, yes, sir. As I was just saying
to Edwards, they've been coming and going
all day like a hive of bees. But it was the
mistress they was after, and it was no use
my telling them she wouldn't be home tonight.
Old William Bennett has the rheumatics
very bad, and wanted some of that
famous liniment ; but you see, sir, I hadn't

the mistress's keys to get it. Then Mrs
Sutton was taken ill, and sent up for her.
As if she could be at all the labours in the
village, as I told 'em. This evening, not
half-an-hour ago, up comes John Wright to
ask if she could step down to his little Katie,
who had scalded her foot with upsetting the
tea-kettle, and she kept on screaming out
for Mrs Freshfield. I sent them down a
roll of cotton wool, and said that would do
the child more good than the mistress, even
if she had been to home. They think they
can't do anything without her now, sir.
It's here, there, and everywhere, they want
her just for all the world as if she was
their slave.'

Poor creatures ! poor creatures ! ' groaned
Bernard, as he thought how his loss would
reflect on so many. His manner alarmed
the housekeeper.

I hope there's nothing wrong, sir ? ' she
said respectfully. ' Me and Edwards have
been quite in a quandary all day, what with

the mistress going away so suddenly, and
you too.'

She was an old servant, who had served
his family faithfully for many years, and he
tried to tell her of his trouble, but broke
down utterly in the attempt.

There is something wrong,' he gasped,
but don't speak to me of it yet, for I cannot
bear it. Only do this for me, Garnett. You
and Edwards have been more than servants
to me ; be my friends in this predicament,
and try to hold your tongues. I  I  don't
quite think she will return,  not just yet, I
mean,  but you shall know all about it by-and-by.
x\nd don't worry me with dinner.
Only leave me alone and undisturbed, and
make the best of it you can downstairs.'

The old woman curtsied to him and instantly
withdrew. She had suspected the
worst from the drift of Mrs Penfold's lamentations,
and the alacrity with which that
lady had removed herself and her belongings
from Briarwood. But the uneducated, however

well-intentioned, can never leave a mystery
to be a mystery They must supplement
it with speculations of their own. Edwards
and Garnett had already decided that as no
one knew why Mrs Bernard Freshfield had
left her home, it was quite evident she did
not go alone, and visions of mustachioed
rakes, v/ith gold-braided uniforms and
swords clanking by their sides, had been
floating through their minds all day. It was
not the slightest obstacle to their imasina-

o o

tion that no officers had been seen in Blue-mere
or its vicinity since their master's
marriage.

I always did hate them milling mary,'
Mrs Garnett had ejaculated, as they discussed
the subject together. ' I might have
been married to a soldier myself; but I
thank the Lord I wasn't ; for I've heard
since as they're the sickles and poorest
and most imperious lot. Poor Garnett
always maintained so.'

And after her interview with Bernard in

VOL. III. F

the library, she was still more certain that
a * nasty soldier ' must be at the bottom of
his undisguised misery, though she and
Edwards were both too faithful to his interests
to do more than whisper their suspicions
in each other's ear. In the servants'
hall they declared  and, let us hope, were
forgiven for the pious lie  that the master
had been with the mistress all day ; but as
she was nursing her own aunt by the father's
side, and the complaint was not infectious,
he had given his leave for her to stay away -
as long as she was required.

And I'm afraid it will be some time
before we see the mistress back again,'
added Mrs Garnett (not content with having
told a lie and done with it) ; ' for / know
what her poor, dear aunt lies ill of, and ita
disease as will never rest till it's carried
her off. And how I'm to satisfy all these
poor people as come hollering after the
mistress, whilst she's away, the Lord only
knows. But if any of you jades go to disturb

the master in the liberty or elsewhere,'

cried Mrs Garnett, with a sudden change

of manner, 'you'll lose your places. He's

plot more than enough to think of and manes
o

age, poor, dear gentleman, with the whole
parish visiting thrown on his hands. So
you mind what I say, ' and keep down herein
your proper places, or it will be the worse
for you.'

Meanwhile Bernard remained in the library,
in silent torture, with his face buried
in his hands, trying to disentangle the confused
thoughts that tripped each other upas
they rushed helter-skelter through his
brain ; to reduce the chaos into order  to
remember exactly what had happened to
him, and to decide what influence it would
exert upon his future. He had one especially
hard task before him  to tell the truth
to his mother. He felt he must tell it ;
that it was due to her and to Laura that they
should hear of the disgrace that had fallen
on the family, through his means, from his

own lips. He did not know how much
or how Httle of the news had already circulated
through Bluemere. Mrs Penfold's
sudden departure seemed as though she was
aware of it ; it would never do for it to
reach Blue Mount by a stranger's hand.
He pulled out pen and paper at once, and
wrote hurriedly ; but his letter was addressed
not to Mrs Freshfield,  but to
Laura.

My dearest Sister,  A terrible blow-has
fallen upon me, Which you must not
hear from any one but myself. Phyllida
has left me. She was never my wife.
She was a married woman when she came
to England, and Cole (who knew her in
America) recognised her directly they met.
Break this news to my poor mother as
gently as you can, and talk about It as
little as possible. And whatever you do,
don't come to Briar wood, for I cannot
speak on this subject nor see any one,

at all events for the present.  Ever your
affectionate brother, Bernard.'

He sealed his letter and dispatched it
by a groom, and then he went up to
the chamber which Phyllida had occupied
and locked himself in, and spent the night
amidst the relics of his lost love, with
which it was strewn. She had taken
nothing away with her apparently, except
the plain serge dress she wore. All the
costly fabrics he had taken such delight
in purchasing for her  the delicate silks
and satins ; the sable trimmed and velvet
mantles ; the lace and jewellery that had
excited the indignation of her mother-in-law
 were all there. She had left them
behind her seemingly with the utmost indifference,
and gone forth into the fog and
the darkness, unprovided and alone. Even
her purse containing the money with which
he supplied her for the parish needs 
(' Judas's bag,' as the poor child had laughingly

called it) lay on the toilet table,
and Bernard took it up mechanically and
counted the contents. A five-pound note,
two sovereigns, and seven shillings in
silver. What had Phyllida taken with
her ? he thought in a dazed manner ; by
what means did she intend to provide for
herself in the future ? But even such
speculations did not cause any feelings of
tenderness or compassion towards her.
His whole heart was hardened by the
blow it had received ; he would not remember
that she had been the wife of
his bosom ; he thought of her only as the
woman who had deceived him and brought
him to shame, who had been deceiving
all her life (so his curdled nature was
ready to believe), and who would go on
deceiving till she died. He was rough
even with the poor things she had left
behind her, and kicked such as lay in his
way to one side with his foot  a very
different mode of procedure to the tenderness

with which he had handled the
reminiscences of the dead oirl whom he
had never loved with one tithe of the
passion which was even then raging in
his breast. Violent emotions must have
their violent counterparts. The deceived
lover who can bless and pardon, has
ceased to regret the infidelity he so readily
condoned, and a woman need never desire
a better compliment from an old admirer
than when he refuses to meet her altogether.
She may rely that he feels himself
too weak to bear her presence, or too
strong : too full of regret for the past, or
too angry with the present. When lovers
become friends, the passion of love has
expended itself. Had Phyllida entered
Bernard's presence at that moment, he
might have killed her.

Meanwhile, it is impossible to describe
the consternation with which his news was
received at Blue Mount. Had he written
to say that Phyllida had dropped down

dead, it could not have surprised and
shocked poor Laura more. She had grown
so fond of her sister-in-law, they had become
so confidential and friendly together,
and read so much of each other's hearts
and minds, that the revelation was as
ghastly as though she had been told that
her mother, whom she honoured above
all women, had led a life of iniquity and
sin.

Phyllida already married, and not to Bernard
! Living at Briarwood, and making
every one so happy there, and showing
such a bright, sweet example to all who
went to her for comfort or advice, and
yet not Bernard's wife  the wife of some
other man ! Oh, it vas incredible  it could
not be ! Berne's mind must have been led
astray by some diabolical arts ; his friend
Nelson Cole must be mistaken, or mad 
or  or  anything, sooner than she could
credit that Phyllida was not as good and
pure as she seemed.

The dear, brave girl read her painful
letter and kept the secret, hugging It to
her breast as the Spartan boy concealed
the fox that preyed upon his vitals  taking
It out In the night, and perusing the horrible
sentences It contained again and again,
but still remaining steadfast to her first Idea
that the thing was Impossible.

She did not heed Bernard's Injunction
that he would not be disturbed either by
her mother or herself, but slipped out of
the house as soon as breakfast was over
the following morning, and made her way
to Briarwood without breathing a word of
her Intention to Mrs Freshfield. She
opened the hall-door (doors are generally
kept upon the latch in country places),
and without ceremony entered the library.
There sat her brother at his writing-table,
pale, hollow-eyed, and stern, but still occupied
just as usual with his parish papers.
His greeting to Laura was not a genial
one, 

I thought I desired you not to come
here,' he said gravely.

I know you did, dear, dear Berne ; but
how do you suppose I could obey such an
order ? I received your note  I need not
tell you that ; but I have not said a word
about it to mamma.'

'Why not?'

Because I don't believe what you wrote
to me : because I think you must be labouring
under some terrible delusion, and I
want to see if it cannot be cleared away
again.'

It is not a delusion ; it can never be
cleared away. You might have taken my
word for it,' replied her brother.

No, Berne, I cannot. I must hear
everything about it, from beginning to end.
I want to know what Mr Cole said, and why
he said it, and what it was that frightened
dear Phyllida away . Oh, Berne, I love
her so dearly  she is like m} own sister tome.
I cannot give her up at a moment's

notice, and on the condemnation of a man
who is a perfect stranger to me.'

Oh, Laura, you might have spared me
this ordeal groaned Bernard, with his face
burled in his hands. * I tell you there is no
mistake  it is but too true  and the fact that
directly she was taxed with her crime, she
fled from my protection, is sufficient proof
that she knew it to be true.'

Who taxed her with it ? '

Nelson Cole. He knew her in America,
under the name of Harcourt.'

Berne, I hate this Nelson Cole. What
does he mean by coming as a welcomed
guest into such a happy family as ours, and
spreading misery and dissension amongst
us in this way . '

You don't know what you are talking
of, Laura. You cannot understand such a
matter. No man, who is worthy of the
name, could see his friend the dupe of an
artful intricate, without opening his eyes
to his disgrace,'

Bernard, how dare you speak of Phyllida
by such a name ? ' replied his sister boldly ;
if yozt can forget in so short a time all she
has been to you, / cannot. An intricate !
I would as soon believe myself to be one.'

Oh, Laurie, Laurie, you don't know how
much harder you are making all this for me
to bear. Yesterday I would have said the
same as yourself  to-day I cannot. But
don't think that I would not blot out the
conviction (if I could) with my heart's blood.
God knows, I would die ten thousand deaths
to restore Phyllida to the place she once held
in my estimation.'

'And so would I, darling; so would I,'
cried the warm-hearted Laura, ' and do you
think it possible that a bad woman would
have been able to gain such power over
us as that ? Do you imagine that a deceitful,
lying adventuress (such as Mr Nelson Cole
would wish us to believe dear Phyllida to be)
could change all at once to the sweet, loving,
sympathising soul who made herself the

good angel of Bluemere ? Why, brother,
the people simply worship her. And you
have let your fine American friend drive
her away.'

She went of her own accord,' sighed
poor Bernard ; ' besides, no sophistry nor
arguments can alter facts, and the fact remains
 she was a married woman.'

To whom was she married ? '

Oh, what does it matter ? to some low
ruffian in the States ; or rather she was
divorced from him (but you know how I
regard divorce), when she was cruel enough
to go through the farce of wedding me.'

Is her husband dead since then ?'

Yes. He died some months ago.'

Then you can marry her over again,'
cried Laura confidently.

Laura, of what are you thinking ? Marry
a woman who laid herself out to deceive
me. Who lived here for six months with
a secret that was eating out her very
heart, and never disclosed it to her husband,

who sat at my table and smiled in
my face  '

Yes, and who brought sunshine into
your heart despite the canker in her own ;
who could make the poor happy whilst she
suffered herself ; who could watch by the
bedside of the sick whilst she wanted
comfort and consolation most of all. My
poor, brave Phyllida ; my dear, sweet sister.
If everybody else turns against her, I will
search the world until I have found her,
and thanked her for all the love she
showed to us.'

But Bernard turned away from Laura
with offended dignity. How hard it is to
knock his pride out of the very best
of Englishmen. It is an integral part of
himself. The poor man shows it as openly
as the rich, and both are rather proud
of being proud than otherwise. Bernard
Freshfield's heart was burning to relieve
itself by tears ; the mention of Phyllida's
virtues touched him to the very quick ;

but he would not give way to the weakness
of allowing any part of her to be good.
She had deceived him, that was quite
sufficient.

I should be sorry that my mother
should hear you speak In such a manner,
Laura,' he said gravely. * Whatever my 
my  I mean whatever Phylllda was In
Bluemere she can never be again, and she
would never have been had her antecedents
been honestly revealed to us. Cole knew
her as a burlesque actress on the American
stage, and  and  not always as quietly
conducted as she should have been even
there.'

How 7j2ean of him to tell, even. If he
did know,' replied the girl with flashing
eyes. * But I don't believe It, and I won't ;
and even If she were an actress, does that
make her good deeds the less to be admired ?
It makes them a thousand times more
valuable. It Is not often a woman gives
up all the excitement and gaiety of professional

life to be the Lady Bountiful of
an out-of-the-way village, and dispense liniments
and bandages to the poor. You
have made Phyllida rise Instead of sink
in my estimation by that announcement,
Bernard, / can tell you.'

But the rock had not yet been smitten
b} the rod that should make the waters
flow.

It would be well If we all possessed
so staunch a little advocate as yourself in
our troubles, Laura,' he answered with a
sickly smile ; ' but I must really ask you
now to leave me. I have a lot of business
on hand, and I am not In very good form
for working.'

Bernard, where Is Phyllida ? '

I cannot tell you. Why will you continue
to mention a name which you must
know Is agony for me to hear ? '

But you don't expect me to drop it
for ever, brother, surely ? A person can't
come in and go out of our lives again in

this fashion without leaving some trace
behind. When are you going after
her?'

Never ! ' he said resolutely.

I don't believe it.'

You must believe what you choose,
Laura. It is impossible for you to read
my heart. I can only tell you what is
written there. And one thing is, that
Phyllida Moss and I will never meet in
this world again.'

Then I don't envy your chances of
meeting her in the next,' said his sister
defiantly ; ' an unforgiving spirit will be,
I should imagine, about the last to enter
heaven.'

Laura, will you be good enough to leave
me to myself You are increasing my
torture to a degree of which I could not
have believed you capable.'

What am I to say to mother, then ? '

Tell her the truth.'

Yes ; when I know what is the truth.'

VOL. III. G

I have already told you ; I have nothing
more to say.'

It will be a grand opportunity for mamma,
certainly,' continued Laura, hoping by
.sarcasm to rouse her brother into action,
for she is going to hold a regular levee
of saints next week, and they will be as
happy tearing poor Phyllida's character to
shreds as your kennel over a defunct sheep.
Miss Janet's brother, the Laird o' Muckheep,
is once more standing on his native heather,
and she has volunteered a visit for all three -
of them to Blue Mount. It will be a sort
of universal jubilee. I believe mamma entertains
flattering hopes that the pious laird
may take a fancy to transplant me to
Garrick - gallants Castle ; and now that
Phyllida is out of the way for good and
all. Miss Bella may yet have a chance of
reigning at Briarwood  the news will just
reach them in time. I expect we shall
have meetings called for praise and thanksgiving
every day.'

Laura, Laura, you are going too far,'
said poor Bernard, writhing under the lashes
she gave him.

I shall never have gone far enough until
I have found Phyllida again,' was the girl's
parting shot, as she ran hurriedly from
the room, lest she should break down
under the crushing disappointment she felt
She was to tell her mother then  there
Alas no help for it  and she would have
to undergo the purgatory of hearing the
name which had become so dear to her,
vilified and abused in every possible way.
How Miss Janet would hold forth on 'carnal
procleevities ; ' how Bella would blink
her sandy eyelashes, and pull down the
corners of her coarsely-moulded mouth, and
profess to be too much shocked to take
part in the conversation. How the hateful
laird (for Laura hated the laird before
she had seen him) would thank God he
was not as other men are, and her infatuated
mother would chime in and agree

with everything they said, and think them
the most pious people she had ever met.

Well, what must be, must be ; but though
she was a brave young woman, Laura Fresh-field
felt that she would dearly like to have
some one to help her in breaking the news
to her mother ; some one to stand between
herself and the inevitable storm ; someone
to make the best of things, not only
at Blue Mount but at Briarwood. And feeling
thus, her thoughts seem to go naturally
(as it were) to Charles Anderson, Bernard's
greatest friend, and a man to whom
he would listen, perhaps, sooner than to
any other, because he had strong religious
feelings, and had given up his best prospects
in life for the sake of his faith. Mr
Anderson was resident in London ; but our
young lady was quite equal to dispatching
a telegram to his address ; and the same
afternoon he appeared at Blue Mount.
Laura contrived to receive him alone (indeed
Mrs Freshfield always shirked the

young Catholic's presence, from dread of
social contamination), and in a few minutes
she had put him in possession of the terrible
story.

Go over to Briarwood and tell Berne
what to do she said, in conclusion ; ' he
will take your advice, Charlie, when he
would listen to that of no other. He
thinks so highly of your discretion and
powers of judgment.' *

He flatters me, Laura,' replied Anderson,
' and you have set me a very difficult
task, yet I will do my best for your sake and
Bernard's ; but what can I say to him } '

Charlie, wasn't their marriage sacred '. '
Of course, my dear Laura, all marriages
are sacred ; but in this case you see  '

Oh, I am not speaking of its legality,'
she interrupted hastily ; ' I know, of course,
that the marriage ceremony would have to
be performed over again ; but I am speaking
of their hearts. They truly loved each
other. Berne used to say theirs was a

perfect union ; that they were in reality one.
How can anything that occurred before that
marriage destroy its sacred unity ? '

'It is a hard question to answer, Laura ;
you must give me time to think over it.'

I cannot do that. You must either ofo
over to Briarwood at once, or break this
dreadful intelligence to mamma ; for I tremble
at every ring at the bell lest it should bring
some visitor open-mouthed to inform her of
it. But do go to Berne first. He would
hardly speak to me this morning ; but to
you he may confide something that will
soften the blow to mamma.'

I can refuse you nothing, Laura,' replied
Mr Anderson, as he prepared to start for
Briarwood.

E reached Brlarwood at dusk, and
found his friend Bernard still in
the library, professing to read
and write, but in reality doing nothing but
stare into vacancy. He had not moved
from his seat all day, nor taken any nourishment.
The fire was nearly out ; the lamps
were unlighted ; the desolation of the apartment
bespoke the corresponding feeling in
the owner's heart.

This is kind of you, Charlie,' he said
languidly, as Anderson took his hand, but
he never rose from his seat to welcome
him ; ' how did you hear the news ? I

can see you slave heard it from your face ;
surely it is not in possession of the newspapers
yet ? '

No, no, Bernard, no such thing ; don't
talk nonsense. I came down to Bluemere
on receipt of a telegraphic message from
your good little sister, who has an idea
that the presence of an old and very true
friend may prove some comfort to you in
this trouble.'

Nothing can comfort me, Charlie, and
no one. It is a wound past cure. The
sooner I bleed to death the better. '

Yes,' said Anderson reflectively, ' and
meanwhile, what is to become of your
profession and your parish and your
people ? '

I need have no fear for them,' replied
Bernard. ' They could not fall into worse
hands than mine. I have been altogether
wrong from beginning to end. I see it
more plainly now than I have ever
done.'

Indeed, this is news to me. I imagined
that you and Bluemere were on
excellent terms with one another, and
that everything in the parish was working
smoothly and well. How long is it since
you found out it is altogether wrong ? '

Since she left me ! ' burst out Bernard
passionately ; ' since she took all the sunshine
and hope of life away with Her, and
made mee the most miserable man upon
earth. It is she who has done it all,
Anderson ; I swear it. We were  we were
so happy together, and now there is nothing
before me but a wretched blank. I feel
as if I were going to the devil, and it won't
be her fault if I dont go there.'

Bernard, you shock me,' said Anderson,
-" and make me feel more strongly than ever
how wise is our Church in prohibiting the
marriage of her priests. A woman  one
single woman turns out to be something
different from what you expected her to be,
.and everything in consequence  your vows,

your profession, your people, and your
prayers  are to look after themselves, or
worse. I couldn't have believed it of
you.'

I know what you would tell me replied
Bernard wildly, 'that God is left, and
whatever happens, He is always ours, and
I know it  / know it ! but oh, Charlie,
old boy, He is behind a cloud. I cannot
see Him or hear Him, or feel* His hand;;
and I am going mad. I know I am. I
am going out of my senses with grief and
longing and fear.'

And throwing his head suddenly down
upon his outstretched arms, Bernard Fresh-field
gave way to one of those storms of
emotion which men sometimes indulge in,
and cried as violently at if he had been a
child. His friend did not attempt to check
him ; on the contrary, he left his seat and
walked round the room, professing to
examine the pictures and ornaments, until
Bernard should have had time to recover

himself. But, by-and-by, whilst the parson
was still catching his breath in the convulsive
manner that succeeds passionate weeping,
he felt a kind, warm hand laid on his
which, without looking up, he grasped between
both of his own.

Charlie, dear old fellow,' he sobbed,
you have always been like a brother tome,
but this is an ill you cannot cure.'

I don't profess even to try to do so,
dear Bernard,' said Anderson ; ' but perhaps
it may be ameliorated. When you feel strong
enough for the task I want you to tell me
all the rights and wrongs of it.'

There aix no rights  it is all wrongs,'
groaned the unfortunate husband, .* and it
has humiliated me as nothing else on earth
could have done. Fancy, Charlie, me, with
my grand ideas of the sanctity of marriage
the greatest human sacrament in existence 
the institution of God for the regeneration
of mankind by a dual existence  taken in,,
duped, dishonoured by the woman whom

6)

I had made part of my very life. But I
see it all now ; my eyes are open. I
worshipped her instead of the God who
made her, and I am justly punished for my
sin. But oh, if the Lord had but adopted
some other means by which to empty the
vials of His wrath upon me.'

Bernard, did your wife  '

Don't call her by that name. She is not
my wife.'

If I understood your sister rightly, she
believed herself to be your wife, and you
believed her to be so, therefore I think she
has every claim to the name. However, I
will call her Mrs Freshfield. You will at
least not refuse to grant her the courtesy
which is accorded to those women who
assume her position, knowing it to be
such.'

Bernard groaned, but answered nothing.

*When Mrs Freshfield left Briarwood, she
surely gave an explanation of her actions
to some one.'

She left a note behind her for me.'

May I ask what was in it, Bernard ?'

The parson unlocked a drawer in his
writing-table, and taking thence a half sheet
of paper, threw it across to his friend.

You can read it if you like. There it is.'

Anderson took the note in his hands and
examined it closely ; when he had finished
the perusal, he simply raised his eyes and
fixed them on those of his companion.

Well,' said Bernard, in a tone of voice as
though he defied him to find any excuse for
Phyllida in that.

Well.' echoed Anderson, ' have you read
this letter, Bernard ?'

Of course I have read it.'

More than once ? When you have been
calm enough to decipher its meaning " '
persisted his friend.

I don't know what you're driving at,
Charlie. The words are plain enough  no
one can misunderstand them.'

I should have thought so, too, but it

appears I am mistaken. May I read it to
you ? '

If you will, but I don't see the use of it.'

Anderson, not heeding the grumbling
remonstrance, commenced to read, 

' Bernard, by the time this reaches you,
your friend will have told you all he knows
about me ; and you will have learned how
much you have been deceived." '

There, you see what she says herself,'
interrupted Freshfield. ' She acknowledges
I was grossly deceived.'

How could she do otherwise, poor girl '. '
replied Anderson ; ' the question is, how far
she was deceived herself. Her words tell
how deeply she felt for you.'

'' But oh, my darling, don't fret about it.
I will never disgrace you more. I am going
away where you will never hear of me.
Only try to forget everything about me,
.excepting''  read, Anderson, slowly and emphatically
 " excepting that I loved you very
dearly, and had not strength to do what I

might to have done. But indeed  indeed,
I believed myself to be your wife." '

Does she say that ? ' asked Freshfield
quickly, as Anderson came to a full stop.

Does she say that ? Of course she
does. I thought you told me just now
that you had read the letter.'

So I did, when I first received it, but
it was such an awful blow to me, my head
was all in a whirl ; and then I had to go
with Cole to London and see a fellow
called Neville, who had known her in the
lowest possible position, and oh, Charlie,'
continued Bernard, breaking down again,
if you had heard what they had to tell
me, you would never talk of there being
any hope again.'

Bernard, old fellow, confide the very
worst to me. You know I am to be
trusted, and I cannot advise you unless I
hear it. What are the most serious
charges these gentlemen bring against
Mrs Freshfield?'

That she Is the daughter of some low
ruffian who kept a gambling saloon in
Sacramento Valley.'

'Well, that is unfortunate; but it is not
her fault, and it has certainly left no
traces on her behaviour. What next ? '

She was married at sixteen to a man
who turned out to be a criminal, Anderson,,
a forger, and got two years' imprisonment
in a New York gaol ; and, meanwhile,
Phyllida, who was on the stage  fancy
the stage for my wife, Charlie ! (he interpolated
with a shudder)  got an irregular
divorce from the brute, and came to England
and married me,  /, who do not believe
in any kind of divorce ; and had I known
her antecedents, would have avoided her
even as a friend.'

I thought you considered yourself a
broad-minded man,' said Anderson ; ' however,
let that pass. Did Mrs Freshfield
consider her divorce to be complete, from
a moral as well as a legal point of view t '

I suppose she did, from what she says
here.'

And married you, believing herself a
free woman ? '

Perhaps so ; but that didn't make her
free.'

'Can you call to mind, Freshfield,
whether in your courting days you ever
questioned her as to her past ? It seems
strange you should have married a woman
who was an absolute stranger to you.'

I am not sure if I did. I know she
refused to marry me several times, and
made me so mad, that I was determined
to have her at all risks.'

Rather a worldly sort of proceeding
that for a parson,  eh, Bernard ? and one
that lays the onus of such a marriage
more upon your shoulders than hers.
Don't you think so ? '

Oh, I don't deny I was to blame,
Charlie. I am only cursing my own folly
in being so easily taken in.'

VOL. III. H

I deny that you were '' taken in." It
appears to me you entered into the contract
with your eyes wide open to the
truth that they were not so ; in fact, it
suited your convenience to be hoodwinked.'


I was infatuated with her,' sighed Fresh-field.
' No woman has ever held me in
such thrall as she did  '

As she does, you mean. Now look here,
Bernard, it seems to me the case stands
thus  you meet a very pretty girl of whom-you
know nothing, and fall desperately in
love and marry her nilly-willy. She (believing
herself to be free) takes you at
your word, and you probably said that you
couldn't live without her. Didn't you,
now ? '

Oh, I daresay I did. She made fool
enough of me for anything.'

She has certain unfortunate antecedents
(I won't call them disgraceful, for
they were not her fault. How could

she help being married to a forger or
thrown on the stage for a subsistence),
and naturally, I suppose, she argues that
If there Is no need to disclose them,
It will be the happier for both that
you should remain In Ignorance. It Is
not strict honour, you know, according
to the code of rules men set down for
one another  but you mustn't judge a
woman's morals as you would those of our
sex. They are not reared under the
same method. Besides, I conclude she
was In love, and everything may go to
the winds for a woman when she's once
thoroughly in love.'

Charlie, what are you driving at ? '
demanded Bernard, with open eyes.

Nothing, my dear boy, unless you will
answer me this question. Do you still
love Phyllida Moss?'

A look of the deepest agony passed
over the parson's face, such a look as we
may suppose on the features of a man

wrestling with God for pardon for some
mortal sin.

'Love her!' he ejaculated. 'God knows
I love her with every fibre of my wretched
heart. Oh, Anderson, that is the worst
of it. I feel that I shall never cease to
love her to my dying day.'

No, Bernard, that is the best and not
the worst of it. If these are your feelings,
the sooner you are re-united to that woman
the better.'

Hope flashed into Freshfield's haggard
face, as the sun suddenly breaks out from
behind a murky cloud. His misery had
been that re-union with Phyllida seemed
impossible, and when a friend suggested to
him what he had not dared to whisper to
himself, it seemed as if the idea would
suffocate him. He pulled at his round
collar as though he were choking, and
rising from his seat threw open the
library window. It was already dark as
night, but the air was full of sound and

the baying of the dogs  those dogs she had
so dearly loved  was borne distinctly from
the adjacent kennel. Bernard leaned out of
the open casement for a moment to recover
himself, then he said in a strangely altered
voice, there was so much fearful joy in
it, 

But how  how could that be, Anderson
? If all my wishes tended to forgive
her  '

What the d  1 have you got to forgive
? ' exclaimed Anderson suddenly.
She is the victim of an error, or twenty
errors if you like. Into nineteen of which
you led her, and all you have to do is to
follow that girl  your wife, mind you 
the woman whom you made your wife
by love, and confidence, and union, more
surely than any bands of law can do It 
and satisfy the demands of your country
and your conscience by marrying her over
again. If you do not, Bernard  if you
cast her off now, after having nurtured

her in your bosom, to wander where she
will  I shall look on you as no better
than a seducer.' And in his excitement
Anderson walked up and down the room
like a caged lion.

But my profession  my people,'
stammered Bernard. ' Can I bring her
here again to reign in Bluemere, where
every labourer's child will have heard her
history ? '

Don't bring her here, then ; you are
an independent man. Take her anywhere
that seems best to you. You
have not married your people, but you
have married her, and your first duty is
towards her. What do you suppose it
will benefit you to appear before the
Almighty with five thousand converts
shining like jewels in your crown,
whilst the one soul you have sworn to
protect and cherish is damned for everlasting,
through the cowardice which
would prevent your bearing the shame

of your mutual error before the
world ? '

Damned! my Phyllida! Oh, God
forbid cried Bernard, with the tears
running down his cheeks. ' May He
condemn me to the very nethermost
hell if I neglect any means by which
to save her soul. But, Charlie, I took
the vows of ordination as well as those
of marriage. Can I keep both ? '

I see no obstacle to it, old friend.
It may not be advisable to continue your
work here, but there is work waiting for
you all over the world, wherever there
are fellow - creatures to be taught and
souls to be saved.'

Charlie, you have given me fresh life,'
cried the parson, seizing his friend's hand ;
this is what I longed to do, but feared
lest the desire alone was a temptation of
the devil. But you have cleared the
mists from my brain. I can see God
once more, not as the stern judge, condemning

my folly, but the loving Father
who pities it, and holds out His hand
once more for me to grasp, as I grasp
yours.'

Keep fast hold of it, Bernard, and
you cannot go wrong. And now, if you
will take my advice, you will send me
back to Blue Mount to break the intelligence
to your mother.'

Will it be necessary to tell her ? Laura
thought not.'

Laura, in her love for you, thinks only
of what will save you pain. I am sure it
is necessary, Bernard, for two reasons. One
is because concealment must lead to deception,
and deception is wrong ; the other,
that in order to thoroughly clear your wife's
character, everybody must know of the
second marriage. You cannot keep this
matter an entire secret. Little things will
leak out here and there ; and unless you
are perfectly open, the next thing you will
hear is, that you were never married at

all. Let me tell Mrs Freshfield that as
you have discovered that your wife was
a divorced woman at the time of your
marriage, you consider it necessary to .have
the ceremony performed over again, and
she has left Bluemere until it can be accomplished.
This will be the truth (if not
all the truth), and will be putting, I think,
as good a construction upon the matter as
we can.'

Charlie, you are a true, good friend ! '
exclaimed Bernard. ' Your visit has raised
me from the very depths of human misery
to the hope of renewed happiness. My
Phyllida, my darling ! Is it possible that
she may be mine again  mine by the laws
of man, and with the smile of God upon
our union ? Oh, Charlie, it is too much 
I cannot realise it ! '

Don't try to do anything but act,
old fellow., You've been realising too
much already, it strikes me ; you look ten
years older in a couple of days. A

change of work will be the best thing for
you.'

'What shall I do first, Charlie? It is you
who must advise me.'

Go up to town to your friend Cole.
Tell him of your intentions, and get him
to help you in your search. I fancy he
is more used to that sort of work than
you are.'

True, true ; and he is the best of
fellows, though he did deal me such a
terrible blow. I will start for London by
the seven o'clock train ; and you  what
will you do, old chum ? '

I shall return to Blue Mount, and
try to smooth matters over for the old
lady.'

Give her my love, Charlie, and explain
why I felt myself unable to carry the news
.myself.'

I will explain everything ; never fear.'

You are the very best of fellows,' said

Bernard earnestly. ' What can I ever do
to repay you ? '

Some day I may put your gratitude to
the test,' replied Anderson, laughing, as he
bid his friend farewell.

RS Tenfold was not staying
with Mrs Pinner, although the
housekeeper was quite correct
in saying she had gone there. But in the
afternoon of the day succeeding PhylHdas
mysterious flight, and whilst Bernard was
still in town, she had received a note by
post, a faint scrawl in pencil, half washed
out by tears, in which her cousin had told
her partly the truth,  had said, at least, that
she had disgraced Mr Freshfield beyond all
remedy, and should never return to Briar-wood
again. And then Mrs Penfold had
felt that the rectory was no longer the place

for her, and that it would be more delicate
to go at once before the parson came home.
So she had packed up her small belongings
and thrown herself on the hospitality of her
sister. Perhaps, if Mrs Pinner had sympathised
with her anxiety about Phyllida, or
shown the least compassion for the unfortunate
girl, cast upon the world for the
second time, friendless and alone, Mrs Pen-fold
might have prolonged her stay in Blue-mere
until she had ascertained what position
the Freshfields intended to take up with regard
to her cousin's behaviour. But Mrs
Pinner s condemnation was so entirely without
limit, that Mrs Penfold made up her
mind to return to Gatehead the very next
day.

Be good enough, Maria,' Mrs Pinner had
said, when her sister tried to make some
excuse for the absent girl on account of her
defective training, * be good enough never
to mention that disgraceful creature's name
in my hearing again. We cannot touch

pitch without being defiled, and I feel as if
it would be a long time before my house
and surroundings recovered the contamination
they must have contracted from her
presence here.'

But Mrs Penfold had a mother's heart.
It was quite a mistake on the part of nature
not to have given her children, for she would
have loved them tenderly, and her thoughts
and prayers, poor old soul, were with her
erring little cousin night and day.

Indeed, Charlotte,' she replied, ' I think
you are too hard on her. Of course I
cannot entirely understand her reasons for
leaving Briarwood from the very incoherent
note she sent me, but I can see that she
thinks it her duty to go, and that she is
very, very miserable in going ; and a woman
who does her duty, although it makes her
wretched, cannot be altogether bad.'

Stuff and nonsense,' said Mrs Pinner.
You always were a simpleton, Maria, but
I hardly thought you could be so silly at

your age. Do you suppose it's likely she's
gone alone ? Did you ever hear of a married
woman running away by herself ? You
must be a born fool to believe it.'

Good gracious me, Charlotte, what do
you mean ? Who do you suppose she would
take with her ? Besides, I am certain she
went alone. There were only Mr Freshfield
and Mr Cole and the servants in the rectory
at the time, and I can answer for it they all
stayed behind.'

Mrs Pinner gazed at her sister with the
supreme contempt.

'Well, if this comes of letting lodgings,'
she began, when the other interrupted
her, 

Do you mean to insinuate,' she said indignantly,
'that Phyllida has disgraced us
all by running away with a mail ? Oh,
Charlotte, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
And when you know how devoted
she was to Mr Freshfield, how can you
say so wicked and cruel a thing ? '

Hoity tolty, ' cried Mrs Pinner, ' here's
a flare up about nothing. What do you
suppose all the village are saying about it ?
Annie Warren tells me there is hardly a
cottage where they have not heard the
whole story, and put their own construction
on it. Run away alone, indeed ; a likely
story. No one else will believe it if
you do  not if she came back tomorrow
with that smooth hypocritical face of her's
and swore she'd only been on a round of
parochial visits.'

'But who could she run away with ? '
gasped Mrs Penfold, staggering under the
unexpected assertion.

Who, indeed ? As if my lady hadn't
cunning enough to keep all her affairs secret.
You know how close she was from the
beginning. Don't ask who is it, but who
may it not be. Any one, I should say, who
would take her. Mr Anderson, perhaps,
for want of a better. Those Papists will
do anything if they're not found out, and

Mr Anderson Is one of the slyest looking
men I ever saw.'

Charlotte !' exclaimed Mrs Penfold, looking
her sister full in the face, ' you are the
very wickedest woman I ever saw.'

What!' screamed Mrs Pinner.

I repeat it, the wickedest woman I ever
saw. You go to church twice every Sunday
and read your Bible, and say your prayers,
and you are always talking of religious things
and using sacred names ; but you haven't
got as much charity in you as a grain of
mustard seed. You made the worst instead of
the best of poor Phyllida from the very beginning,
and only left off abusing her when
she became Mr Freshfield's wife, and there
was everything to gain by keeping friends
with her. And now that she is under a
cloud again, poor little soul, though you
know no more of the facts of the case than
I do, you suspect her of the grossest iniquity
without any better foundation than what
your unworthy suspicions supply you with.

VOL. III. I

But, In my opinion, you are much more to
blame than she Is (since you have enjoyed so
many more privileges), and, instead of reviling
her, you had better go upstairs and
go down on your knees and pray to Heaven
to change your hard heart and make you
more charitable to your fellow-creatures.'

During this harangue Mrs Pinner's
face had gradually assumed the appearance
of an infuriated turkey cock. Her
wattles (if I may be allowed to use such
an expression for a lady's double chin)
had turned purple, her forehead was
crimson, and every poppy In her cap
shook, as though under the breath of a
tornado.

Maria Penfold,' she ejaculated as soon
as she could speak, ' leave my house ! '

'You need not take the trouble of
turning me out, Charlotte. I wouldn't
stay here if you paved my room with
gold. No, and I wouldn't change places
with you (although you do look down on

me for letting lodgings), not if you were
a duchess in your own right'

Leave my house ! ' repeated Mrs
Pinner. ' I will listen to no more insults
at your hands.'

And you never will was Mrs Pen-fold's
parting shot, ' for unless your hard
heart is softened, and you begin to
practise the religion which at present
you only talk about, I shall take good
care not to see you again,' and with that
she sent out for the only vehicle to be
hired in Bluemere, and was landed safely
by the train in Gatehead the same evening.

But she had the consolation of receiving
an unfeignedly hearty welcome on
her return. Miss Annadale, who

scarcely ever stirred out of her own
apartments, came half way down stairs
to greet her landlady, and Captain Barclay
insisted on her sharing his roast chicken
and mushrooms, and drinking a glass
of Madeira with him in his snug little

parlour, Instead of sitting down to a
solitary meal.

First-rate wine that, Mrs Penfold,'
said the old sailor, as he handed her a
bumper of the rich coloured Madeira ;
drink it down. It will do you good,
I promise you. That Madeira made
four voyages round the Cape in my own
ship, Mrs Penfold, so I ought to know its
quality, if no one else does.'

And under the influence of the
Madeira, and Captain Barclay's kindness,
the poor woman unbosomed her griefs to
him, and confided her fears with regard
to her young cousin.

'Think of that poor young creature,
captain, wandering about the world
alone  and so pretty, too. What will
become of her ? I assure you I haven't
slept a wink since it happened, for wondering
what I can do to find her again.
For whether she's right or wrong, she's
too young to be left to herself, and I

must have her back at Gatehead, as sure
as my name is Maria Penfold.'

Mrs Penfold,' exclaimed the old sailor,
extending his brown hand across the table
for her acceptance, ' you're a good woman,
madam !  a good woman, never mind
who the other may be. Let that pretty
girl with the big brown eyes go about
the world alone, without a friend or protector
? By gad ! no. Why, I'd protect
her myself, if there was no one else todo
it. But I don't see how you are to
get at her, my dear, unless you advertise
in the papers.'

Why, of course, captain, that is the very
thing,' cried Mrs Penfold, jumping up from
her chair ; 'and I'll have the advertisement
written out and sent to the post-office this
very evening. I suppose I'd better insert
it in the Telegraph and Standard!

And the Times, my dear, the Times'
added the captain, who was used to becoming
rather affectionate in his speech after dinner.

And the Times, of course,' replied Mrs
Penfold. ' What a help you are to me,
captain. Whatever should I do without
you ? '

And when you have dispatched your
advertisement, you will come back again,
won't you ? ' said Captain Barclay.

Well, captain, if you really require me,'
replied Mrs Penfold bashfully.

Really require you, madam. I really
require you every hour of the day. You
don't know what my life has been during
your visit to Bluemere  torture, Mrs Pen-fold,
torture. Sarah has been very attentive
 I have no complaint to make of Sarah ;
but she is not, and she cannot be, yourself ;
that is her misfortune, Mrs Penfold, and not
her fault. I have missed you every day
and everywhere. My bed has not felt
the same, and my parlour has not looked
the same, and this chicken, for instance 
although Sarah has done her best with it,
I am sure, her very best  yet this chicken

is not browned in the way pott would have
browned it ; eh, Mrs Penfold ? '

Well, you see, captain, it is impossible
to put grey heads on green shoulders ; however,
I am home once more to attend to all
your little comforts, and not likely to leave
you again in a hurry.'

Not if I know it, madam, not if I know
it,' replied Captain Barclay, with a facetious
wink at his landlady.

Well, really, captain, I don't see how
you are to prevent it ; not if my mind were
bent upon going, for instance.'

'There are ways and means, Mrs Penfold,
ways and means,' said the captain, with
another wink.

Meanwhile, we must return to Blue
Mount. Charles Anderson only waited
until Bernard was well out of the way to
break the intelligence of her son's disappointment
to Mrs Freshfield, and do
what he could to comfort her, the poor
old lady's grief and shame were but too

genuine. A divorced woman was, in her
eyes, quite as ineligible a subject for the
marriage contract as a wife would be, and
Anderson did not attempt to refute any of
her arguments on this part of the matter.
Only he kept on repeating the fact that
Phyllida's first husband was now dead,
and therefore according to the laws of
God and man there could be no possible
obstacle to her re-union with Bernard. But
to his astonishment he found that Mrs
Freshfield did not take this view of the
subject at all, and was strongly opposed
to the Idea of her son having anything
more to do with the woman who, in her
opinion, had betrayed him. This mother,
who had reared her child in the strictest
principles of her own religion ; who had dedicated
him from his birth (as it were) to
the Lord and His service, and who (Anderson
would have supposed) could have but
one desire in her heart at this crisis,
namely, that Bernard should act up to

0/

his profession, and do what was right ;
commenced arguing against the advisability
of a second marriage on the most
worldly grounds.

But it would be perfect madness,' she
said, when Anderson confided to her the
motive that had taken her son to town.
'Surely, Mr Anderson, you never gave
Bernard such advice as that ? By the
Lord's mercy he has been delivered from
the bonds of a strange woman, though, if
he had only waited to consult his poor
mother on the subject, he never would
have married a person of whom one knew
positively nothing ; however, he was
headstrong, and had his own way, and
now that his evil has been turned into
good, I consider it would be flying into
the face of Providence to re-forge the
chains that have been struck off him.'

Do you mean to say then, Mrs Fresh -
field, that you would advise Bernard not
to marry his wife again . '

Certainly, I would, Mr Anderson. She
Is not his wife. You have said so yourself.
She Is only a most disreputable person 
a disgrace to her sex  a  '

Oh, pardon me, I never said so much
as that, because I do not think it ; but,
even If It were the case, I am not sure
but what It would still be Bernard's duty
to try and reform her by the only means
in his power.'

Well, I consider your ideas of duty
are far-fetched, Mr Anderson, and I am
surprised to hear a member of your Church
upholding the sanctity of marriage with a
divorce. I am no friend to Popery  '

No, Indeed, you need not tell me that,
Mrs Freshfield.'

But I do at least agree with it in one
particular, and that is, that had this woman's
divorce from her first husband been ever
so regular, it should not have permitted her
to contract an alliance with my poor misguided
son.'

And I am not likely to gainsay you,
Mrs Freshfield. I say nothing of the past,
except that it is as sad as sad can be, and
I feel deeply for my dear old friend ; bat
I think that his duty now lies straight before
him, and that is to make the woman
to whom he is already united by ties of
the tenderest affection his wife by law.'

Well, I am surprised to hear you say
so,' replied the mother coldly. ' I was
aware, of course, that poor Bernard was
very much infatuated with her when he
believed her to be a good and pure woman
(though why he should have squandered a
small fortune in decking her out in pearls
and satin far above her station in life I
never could understand), but I should have
thought and hoped that, his eyes once opened
to her iniquity and deceit, a son of mine
would have turned from her with the loathing
and disgust which she deserves.'

Oh no, Mrs Freshfield, don't wrong
your own nature by saying so,' pleaded

Anderson. ' What ! turn from those we love
when they most need our counsel and assistance
?  look the other way when our dear
ones, however erring, lift their tearful eyes
to ours ?  shut the door upon the repentant
sinner who is longing to receive her
pardon from our lips ? That is not the
way a merciful God deals with our trespasses
 blessed be His holy name!' said
Anderson reverently, ' or we should indeed
be the most forlorn and miserable of creatures.
What should you say, madam, if
your heavenly Judge dealt with your sins
as you would have Bernard deal with
hers ? '

Now, although Mrs Freshfield called herself
a miserable sinner every Sunday, and
perhaps two or three times in the week to
boot, she did not in the least believe that
she was so, and Charles Anderson's straightforward
question considerably ruffled her
dignity. That a man, and a young man,
and above all other things a Catholic young

man, should presume to talk to her in such
a manner greatly offended her ; and she
showed the offence in her answer, 

If you intend to compare me with the
person we were speaking of, Mr Anderson,
we had better drop the subject ; for
I cannot see that the two cases tally in the
slightest degree. I do not need you to
remind me that there is forgiveness in
heaven for all who sin on earth, but I do
not see how it is to be attained by setting
this depraved young woman again in the
position which she has polluted and disgraced,
and when Bernard tight have
secured one of the most estimable and
pious young ladies for his helpmeet  a
girl with the oldest blood of Scotland in
her veins, and descended from a line of
kings  one who would have conducted herself
in all things as the wife of a minister
should do, and been an honour and blessing
to the whole family.'

Yes, it is unfortunate, doubtless, that

he could not see with your eyes ; but these
are matters, Mrs Freshfield, in which men
will and ought to judge for themselves.
An union entered into from any feelings,
however pure  except those of entire and
disinterested love  cannot be a real union.
I have seen men marry, apparently from
the best of motives  for conscience' sake 
or for the good of others, but however
unselfishly entered into, unless it is from
love alone, marriage is no longer a sacrament,
but sinks to the level of a legal
contract.'

And would you call my poor son's
marriage with this dreadful girl a sacrament,
Mr Anderson?'

I do indeed, Mrs Freshfield, and would
continue to do so, even if he did not marry
her over again. His heart is knit up in
hers, as hers is no less in his, and that
constitutes a true marriage.'

I don't believe it,' interposed the old
lady, trembling with excitement. * My poor

son's eyes were dazzled by her beauty till
he could not distinguish right from wrong,
and I consider that any one who persuades
him to take that woman back again, is his
worst enemy, and not his friend.'

And you would wish Bernard never to
see her again then, nor to inquire after
her fate ? '

Decidedly I would. He has taken a
wife from among the daughters of Heth as
the rebellious son of Rebecca did, and you
see what has come of it. He ought to
thank Providence, who has helped him to
escape so great a danger, and not fly in
its face by courting it a second time.'

And you would consider him free to
marry again if he felt inclined to do so ? '
continued the young man.

Of course he is free. What claim can
she bring against him ? Oh, if Bernard
would only see it in the same light, and
put some dear good girl in the vacant
place ! '

You think the divorce he has obtained
from his present wife Is more legal then, than
the one she got from her former husband ? '

Oh, there Is no question of divorce,'
replied the old lady, tossing her head ina
nervous manner ; ' she never was his
wife, and I would rather discuss the painful
subject no longer, Mr Anderson.'

Very good, madam. I have done Bernard's
bidding, and therefore may take my
leave of you. But I am glad I do not
share your sentiments on the question of
right and wrong ; neither do I think they
would receive endorsement from above.'

And Anderson quitted Blue Mount, leaving
Mrs Freshfield with the very uncomfortable
sensation of having been brought
to task, and considerably worsted in the
encounter. Laura was not present at this
interview. Had she been it would not
have proceeded with so little interruption,
for this young lady coincided with the
opinions of Mr Anderson on all subjects

in a remarkable degree. But she received
the full benefit of it afterwards.

Such an extraordinary manner in which
to be addressed by a young man of his
age  not so old as my own son by a
couple of years  and a Papist into the
bargain ! ' exclaimed Mrs Freshfield, as she
retailed the circumstances to Laura. * I
wonder what the world will come to next ?
but Mr Anderson may rest assured of one
thing, that I know my duty, and I will
do it. I should have liked dear Miss
Janet to have been present at our conversation
this morning. I know she will
entirely coincide with the view / take of
this disgraceful affair.'

Oh, mamma dear,' cried Laura, * don't
say anything to that old woman about it.
What business is it of hers ? And of
course if she hears it, Bella and the laird
will hear it also, and we shall be obliged
to listen to all their comments on the
matter. It is not delicate, mamma, it is

VOL. III. K

purely a family misfortune  which we
should keep entirely to ourselves for Berne's
sake, if not for our own. And do oblige
me by putting off the visit of these Muck-keeps,
at all events for the present. They
asked themselves, so it could easily be
managed without giving them offence.'

Mrs Freshfield regarded her daughter
solemnly.

And you would seriously ask me, Laura,'
she said, ' in this, the most unfortunate crisis
of my life  when the Hand of Chastening is
so visibly upon us  to deprive myself of
the counsel and advice of my very best and
most valued friends ? '

Oh, mamma, they are not your best friends,
believe me. Miss Janet is only a canting
old hypocrite, and you have never seen the
laird at all. If he is anything like his sister
though, I hope he will cut his visit short.'

Cut his visit short ! ' reiterated Mrs
Freshfield, with much the same look that
might have been expected of her had her

daughter uttered a blasphemy ; ' is that the
way, I ask you, Laura, to speak of a man
who has spent his life in doing good to his
fellow-creatures, who has expatriated himself
for their sakes, and relinquished the society
dearest to him, in order that he might bring
souls grovelling on their knees for pardon.'

Well, mamma, if he has done all this, it is
very good of him, but we have only Miss
Janet's word for it, you know. And in any
case, we don't want him to grovel after souls
here  unless you have any particular work
for him in that way yourself,' said Laura
brightly.

But Mrs Freshfield was in no humour
to respond to brightness  however innocent.

I shall riot put off my friends' visit,' she
said sternly ; ' neither shall I conceal from
them the misfortune which has fallen upon
us. They will advise me, I am sure, to do
what is best in the matter for my unhappy
son, whom your friend, Mr Anderson, appears
bent upon leading to his ruin.'

I don't know why you should emphasise
Mr Anderson particularly as my friend,
mamma,' returned Laura, with a suspiciously
bright colour ; ' but I am not ashamed
of him if he Is, and I do not believe that
he will give Berne any advice but what
is good and proper.'

'Wait and see,' was Mrs Freshfield's
oracular reply, for she had a strong suspicion
that if she told Miss Laura what she meant
by ' ruin,' that the wordy warfare just ended
with Charles Anderson would have to be
fought all over again, so she wisely held her
tongue. The arrival of the Muckheeps the
day after was a grand event in her life, for,
naturally, poor Phyllida's history had to be
retailed from the beginning to the end, 
from the first time they. met her with Mrs
Pinner at Briarwood, to the last tlme she
had sat in that very chair dear Miss Janet
was then occupying (just as if she had been
an honest woman,' as Mrs Freshfield indignantly
added), and the two ladies wept and

wailed and groaned and condemned together
over the reputation which they considered
dead, just (as Laura had prophesied) like
two dogs tearing a carcase to pieces, and
determined not to leave a shred without the
mark of their teeth upon it. But the Laird
o' Muckheepbefore whom Miss Janet (and,
consequently, Mrs Freshfield) mutely bowed,
as though he had been one of the kings from
whom he boasted his descent  took little or
no part in the discussion.

He was a very different man from what
Laura had expected to see him. She had
pictured the laird in fancy to be very like
his sister,  in fact, an old woman in ' breeks,'
but, on the contrary, he did not resemble
her in the slightest degree. He was a large-boned,
muscular man, very plain, with red
hair, a dirty complexion, small ferrety eyes,
and a bottle nose. He was, moreover, very
silent, and allowed Miss Janet to do all the
talking, although he never deprecated the
fulsome praise she lavished on him, but

allowed himself to be worshipped with the
most perfect nonchalance, taking it apparently
as much his right as some ugly old
Chinese god set up in a joss house might
do, and with about the same amount of
interest in his worshippers. Laura, whose
eyes were everywhere at the same moment,
noticed that whenever Miss Janet lauded
her brother's goodness and self-denial,
the laird would' wink and blink, and
become restless and uneasy, changing the
subject as soon as he could, and sometimes
in the most abrupt manner ; but
as he never denied the praise she gave
him, the girl attributed his manner to his
modesty.

Vainly to think, Mrs Frail-field,' the old
Scotchwoman would cry, ' that this gude
mon has ex-penetrated himsel' fra his ain
land far mair than twenty yair in order to
been-fit his perishing fellow-creatures.'

Noo, noo, Janet,' the laird, who spoke
as broad Scotch as his sister, replied, * it's

mickle I have dune. Let us tarn the subject.'


'Mickle !' screamed Miss Janet, * d'ye ca
it a mickle thing, mon, to bide wa' fra your
ain for the space o' twenty yair, an' to pair-se
a' that wheels in preaching and praying and
striving for the pair sails that would'
strive for themselves. Why, it's roost the
laird's wairk that ye're gee-even up your
carry life for, and it's a greet re-ward will
be laid up for ye in heaven.'

Noo, noo, Janet, not me whole life.
Ye forget that I vee-sited the castle ten
airs ago,' said the laird, with a modest
declaimer of so much merit.

Brother, I maun hae me ain way, and
Mrs Frail-field here will uphold me.
It's a gran' wairk, and a blessed ane that
you've even yair time to, an' we should
a' be proud to claim ye as a friend or a
relation. Bella  bar-ck ! '

'Yes, indeed, dear Miss Muckheep,' chimed
in Mrs Freshfield approvingly. ' We should

indeed be proud, and we are (at least I can
speak for myself) to welcome the laird back
to England. Twenty years ! it is indeed a
long time, though none too long to devote
to so noble a cause. And were your efforts
much blessed out there, dear sir ? Did you
bring many poor lost souls back into the
fold?'

Yes, yes ; I had pretty gude success,
madam, altho' a mon should speak of
what he has dune.'

Hoot, brother,' interposed Miss Janet,
but if ye air a burning and a shining
height, ye mauna pet yourself wonder the
beet, bit upon a carn-dle-steek, that sae
ye may geese height to the whole loose.
Diana ye haud wi' me, Mrs Frail-field '. '

Indeed, indeed, I do, although your
estimable brother's modesty renders his
worth all the greater. Ah, we have been
in great need of a missionary to do the
good work here, I can assure you. What
effect might not the laird's influence have

had upon that poor misguided soul at the
rectory ? '

Do ye speak o' your sonne the minister,
Mrs Frail-field, or o' the lizzy he pet op
their as his wife ? '

Laura, who had been silence boiling over
this conversation, here burst in with a remonstrance,


Please to remember, Miss Janet, that the
lady you speak of is about to become my
brother's wife by law.'

No, no, Laura, I trust not  not if / can
help it,' interposed her mother.

You will not be able to help it, mamma ;
and I think the less the subject is discussed
with strangers the better.'

'Hoot, what is the lassie steering at?'
demanded Miss Janet. 'Ye cinna shoo
muckle re-speech for your mither to inter-root
her after sic a fashion, Meet Lichfield.'


I desire to show respect for my brother
and his wife, madam, which is hardly to

be attained by discussing their private
affairs.'

Laura, how can you speak so to Miss
Janet, who, you must know, is in my entire
confidence on this unhappy subject ? We
have just been consulting together on the
best course for me to pursue in the matter,
and I have made up my mind to follow
your poor brother to London tomorrow.'

Bernard will be exceedingly annoyed if
you do so, mamma. He is quite old enough
to manage his own business, and you will
gain nothing by putting your finger in
the pie.'

Petting your finger in the poy ? I
cinna oonderstan' your daughter's mode of
speaking, Mrs Frail-field. I never raised
or Bella after sic a fashion ; it wou'dna
become a teddy o' Muckheep at a'.'

No, indeed,' replied her hostess fretfully
; ' nor any lady in the world, I should
imagine. Laura's fast mode of speaking
shocks me as much as it can do yourself.

But to return to my poor, erring son.
What a consolation it would be to me if
you and the dear laird (who has had so
much experience in winning back lost souls
to the right way) would accompany me on
my sad errand tomorrow. It seems almost
too much to ask from you, but I shall
need both support and guidance on the
journey.'

If you are resolved to go, mamma,'
said Laura, ' for heaven's sake go alone ! '

Young teddy,' exclaimed Miss Janet,
ye cinna ken the rest way to speak to
sech as air abuse yairsel'. Your gude
mither is wa' to Loon-don to try and
breeng your pair brother back to a sense
of his re-sensibilities ; and if I can be
of any cairn-fort or consolation to heron
the pair-ney, she maun depend upon
my company.'

Ah, you are indeed too good to me,'
sighed Mrs Freshfield. 'What should I do
without your kind sympathy and counsel ?

If I can gain an interview with my poor
Bernard before his artful friend Mr Anderson
 a Jesuit in disguise, I verily believe,
Miss Janet  persuades him to sacrifice himself
afresh, and can bring him back with
us to Blue Mount, all may yet be well.
The dear laird's advice would be invaluable
to him at this critical period. He
could so ably point out to my poor boy
the way to induce that young person to
abandon her depraved and godless life without
going to the length of marrying her
over again. An asylum is the place for
her  some nice, respectable asylum where
she will be plainly shown the depths of her
wickedness and sin.'

Here Laura rose hastily, and gathering
her work together, left the room.

My poor child does not like this subject,'
continued Mrs Freshfield, with a compassionate
shake of the head. ' I have
trained her carefully, dear Miss Janet, and
with many prayers, but her heart, I regret

to say, remains hard and stubborn to this
day. I believe that she even goes so far
as to regret her brother's merciful escape
from the thralls of the bond woman.'

Ay ! ' ejaculated Miss Janet. ' Ye
should seest pet me brother upon her in
prayer ; her hair wou'dna' lang remain
laird nor stubborn after that. Mony and
mony a hair has he subdued and melted
by his fair-your, till it coudna' weep eno.'
Ay !  but he's a peen-ache of the temple
before wheel nothing can stan' upreet'

And do you think I might really ask
him to accompany us to town tomorrow ?
It would be an immense favour; but oh,
so gratefully appreciated. I cannot believe
that Bernard will be able to resist his eloquence
; however, he may be inclined to walk
in the downward path.'

Oh, the laird will go with us, cinna fear,
Mrs Frail-field. He maun aye be wheel
the gude wairk is going' on ; and if wards o'
his can tarn the pair sinner fra' the beer-or

of his ways, he will be turned, ye may
reest assured o' that.'

Indeed, indeed, I do. I feel as if an
angel were going with us to point out the
right thing to do, and the right word to
say at the right time,' cried Mrs Freshfield
enthusiastically, as she clasped the freckled
and hairy hand of the Laird o' Muckheep
between her own.

He turned aside with a conscious air and
a few muttered words of acquiescence ; but
his hostess was gazing at him through rose-coloured
spectacles, and attributed his confusion
entirely to the humility of his pious
soul. And the next day, therefore, to
Laura's intense annoyance, her mother set
out for London, supported on either side
by a Muckheep, like sympathising friends
upholding the chief mourner at a funeral.

How angry Berne will be by their interference,'
she thought. ' It would have
been bad enough if mamma had elected to
go to him alone ; but accompanied by that

pair of canting old hypocrites, she will drive
him nearly crazy, and when he has so much
to trouble him, poor darling.'

She was full of such thoughts when a
servant brought her word that Mr Anderson
was in the drawing-room. She flew
to meet him, in a manner most undignified
for a young lady of two-and-twenty, and
with a bloom upon her cheeks that looked
suspiciously as though she where uncommonly
glad to see him. Perhaps Charles
Anderson guessed the truth ; for as Laura
ran up to greet him, he grasped her outstretched
hands and kissed her straight
upon the lips. She drew backward with a
face of crimson.

Oh, Charlie, you shouldn't have done
that. You never did it before.'

Perhaps not ; but there must be a beginning
to all things, you know, Laura.'

Not to bad things, though.'

Was that a bad thing then, Laura '.
Tell me.'

'Well, it can't be quite right, can it?'

'Why not?'

Oh, I don't know, but it isn't the usual
mode of greeting between friends, Charlie.'

But we are not friends.'

Aren't we ? ' she asked, with professed
innocence. ' I thought we were the very
best.'

So we are ; but something more, I hope,
Laura. I love you dearly, and I am sure
you know it.'

I have hoped it, Charlie.'

That's a brave woman to tell the truth
at once. Then it's all right between us ? '

Between tts  oh yes ! but, Charlie, have
you ever thought of mamma ?'

Charlie laughed.

Rather too often for my peace of mind,
Laura. She doesn't like me ; I am aware
of that'

I don't think she has any personal objection
to you, dear ; but it's the religion.
Mamma is frightfully bigoted, you know.

I really believe that she imagines there is
not the slightest chance of your going to
heaven.'

And what do pott think, my Laura ? '
Oh, Charlie, I think you are everything
that is best. I only wish I had the same
assurance of salvation as yourself. To give
up one's family and friends, as you have
done, and all one's prospects in life for the
sake of your faith, what more could any
man do to prove his sincerity ' It is a
grander sacrifice than even the martyrs
made of old. They gave up this life to
gain a better ; but you have given up all
the comforts of the world, and chosen to
walk through it without luxury or love, in
order that you may remain true to yourself;
and I have honoured you for it, dear
Charlie, above all other men, ever since
Bernard told me the story.'

Don't make too much of it, Laura. If
you could guess the consolations I have
received in exchange, you would not think

VOL. III. L

it such a sacrifice. And now, if I am to
have your love into the bargain, I shall be
more than happy, onl)' you mustn't forget
that I am a poor man. My father has cut
me out of his will, and will not even hear
my name mentioned in his presence. I
have only the work of my two hands to
offer my wife as a support'

That is not of the slightest consequence
said Laura indifferently, ' for I have money
of my own as well as Berne. What / am
thinking of is the prejudice of your father
and my mother. Charlie, isn't it extraordinary
that people who profess to love
God with their whole hearts, and desire His
glory above all other things, should quarrel
with any form by which their fellow-creatures
strive to serve Him too ?'

It is almost incredible, Laura, yet we
know it is true. But I cannot call such
people Christians, even though they are my
own flesh and blood. They are pious dogs
in the manger : quite satisfied with their own

position, and ready to snarl at any one who
attempts to dispute It. I suppose It really
did the ox more crowd to nibble at a few
straws than it did the dog to lie on them ;
but since he had no stomach for straw himself,
he was too blind and selfish to see
that the ox needed it. If my friends and
relations have no eyes for the beauty of the
Catholic Church, and no ears for the sublimity
of her doctrine, I pity them and I
pray for them ; but I do not blame them,
for the mind must be spiritually opened to
view It as I do, only I cannot understand
why they must needs quarrel because they
cannot agree with me.'

Do you pity me, Charlie . ' whispered
Laura, sidling up to him.

A little, because you are going to fall
into my clutches. Do you pity yourself?'

She shook her head.

I am quite happy as I am. I do not
know what I may become as the years roll
on, but at present it seems to me as if life

could never be fuller of Interest for me than
it is. I have had Berne ever since I could
remember, and now I have got you, and
I cannot tell which is the best of you ; he
as a Protestant or you as a Catholic. And
I hardly know which of you I love the best
either,' she added more shyly, ' nor, if I
had to give up one, which I should choose.
So you must let me be the link between
you, Charlie, that when you look at me you
may both remember that, as I bind you
together by the names of wife and sister,
so the great Christian Churches should be
bound together In brotherly love by the
one Holy Name which alone can save us
all.'

Anderson drew Laura closer to his side,
and repeated the operation with which he
had greeted her entrance, and this time
she made no objection, although the tears
were shining in her bright eyes.

Oh, Charlie, I am so happy ! '

'So am I, dearest; and you will really

marry me then, spite of all your mother may
say ? '

Mamma will come round after a time.
She is generally open to persuasion from
Berne or me. You know how strongly
set she was at first against poor Phyllida?'

That reminds me, darling, that I came
down here this morning with news of Bernard.
Let us find Mrs Freshfield and tell
her at once.'

Laura's face fell.

Oh, I had quite forgotten. You put
everything out of my head, Charlie ; mamma,
I am sorry to say, has just started for
London to see my brother. I begged and
entreated her not to go, for I am sure her
visit will annoy him, but she would not
listen to anything I said ; and what is more,
she has taken those two Muckheeps with
her  the old laird and his sister  and you
know how Bernard dislikes Miss Janet. I
am sure something very disagreeable will
happen when they meet.'

Anderson became as rave as herself.

I am exceedingly sorry to hear this,
Laura, and I think, under the circumstances,
it was the most ill-advised course your
mother could take ; and this morning, too,
of all days.'

Why not this morning, Charlie ? ' asked
Laura in alarm. ' What has happened to
make this day worse than others ? '

Nothing but what will make you glad,
Laura, but, at the same time, will render
Mrs Freshfield's visit rather malaprop.
Bernard has found his wife again.'

Oh ! Charlie, why didn't you tell me
that before ? ' cried Laura, bursting into
tears of pleasure and excitement. ' Phyllis
home again ! Phyllida with Bernard !
My dear, dear sister found ! Oh, I am so
grateful, so happy ! How can I repay you
for bringing me such joyful news ? '

Kiss me again,' suggested the practical
Charlie.

I willy exclaimed Laura determinately.

as she put both her arms round her lover's
neck, and Hated her burning face to his. ' I
would give you a hundred kisses, Charlie,
if you wished it for making me so happy.'

All right, Laura ; go on.'

No, no, we mustn't be foolish. But
tell me all about it. Where did he find
her ? Where are they now ? How soon
can they be married again ? '

Gently, Laura, you are going too fast.
Bernard has received intelligence of his
wife  he hoped to meet her again to-day
and as poor Phyllida seems to be in a
miserable state of doubt and uncertainty as
to whether she outfit to return to her husband,
he thought the presence of his dear
little sister would be of great service to
both of them.'

Did he send you for me ? Does he
wish me to go to London ? Dear, dear
Berne,' said warm-hearted Laura.

Yes ; indeed that is just what he wants,
and sent me to obtain your mother's permission

to escort you to his side. He
thinks that if his arguments have no effect
on PhylHda, your persuasions are certain
to prevail.'

Of course  of course, I will do my very
best and if she will not return to him, I
can at least remain with her. But, Charlie,
mamma and those horrid Muckheeps will be
there. Ought I to go up at the same time ? '

If you are not afraid to trust yourself
with me, Laura, I think that fact is an
extra reason for your making no delay in
joining your brother. It is very probable,
I am sorry to say, that they may burst in
upon him just as he has been reunited to
his wife, and I am afraid to think what
may pass between them, or how serious
a breach their visit may cause. Your presence
will be an immense protection to your
sister-in-law, and, I am sure, a comfort to
Bernard.'

Then I will get ready to go with you
at once, Charlie. There is only Bella

Muckheep in the house, and as she never
does anything but knit stockings, she will
not miss me for a few hours. I shall tell
her I am suddenly summoned to join my
brother. Ring the bell, and order the pony
chaise as soon as it can be got ready, and
I will be with you again before it comes
round.'

And with a smile and a nod, Laura
Freshfield flew off to her own room, leaving
Charles Anderson in a very contented
and self-satisfied frame of mind.

Bernard Freshened had
started for London about a week
before this, and made his way
at once to the hotel where he knew that
Nelson Cole had taken up his quarters.
He found his friend at home and alone
looking rather more haggard than he had
done at Briarwood, as though he had been
somewhat anxious and thoughtful since they
parted, and sitting at a table covered with
papers.

Bernard, my boy ! ' he exclaimed, as our
parson made his appearance, ' I am glad
you have come up to town again. I was

just about to write and ask you to do so.
I have heard of some business since I saw
you last that will detain me in England,
so I expect to be stationary here for the
next few weeks ; and I want you to spend
them with me. It will be ever so much
better for you than moping at Briarwood
by yourself

Thank you, Cole,' replied Bernard, somewhat
shyly, and there he stopped. Nelson
Cole was surprised at his manner and
appearance. He had expected to see him
the very picture of dejection, but he looked
rather cheerful than otherwise, although his
eyes were heavy and his cheeks pale. Yet
there was an air about him as of one who
had passed through the suffering and found
peace on the other side.

You are bearing this trouble better than
I expected, Bernard,' said Nelson Cole,
almost jealously.

Am I ? You don't know what I have
gone through since we parted. But I

confess I feel happier now than I hoped
to do. I had my dear friend Charles
Anderson talking to me for a couple of
hours this afternoon, and he made me see
things in a different light.'

Ah, he is the pious Papist, is he not ? '

Yes, he is a Papist ; and very proud
of being so ; and he is pious, like most
of his faith. It is an exception to the rule
when a Papist is not pious.'

And he talked to you about heaven, I
suppose, and the reward laid up for martyrs
who sacrifice themselves to their opinions,
until you fell in love with suffering, and
are eine to add a hair shirt to the loss
of your supposed wife ? '

Cole, my dear fellow, why do you speak
to me in this way ? ' exclaimed Bernard. ' I
came up to London to tell you of the
resolution I have, after much thought,
arrived at ; but if you are going to treat my
confidence with sarcasm, you will frighten
it away.'

What resolution can you possibly have
arrived at but one ? ' grumbled Cole ; ' the
girl never was married to you according
to your own ideas. She has led you into
spending some six months in what you
would consider to be mortal sin ; and all
that remains for you is to do penance, and
practise mortifications until you have purged
yourself of even the memory of her unholy
presence. I know you parsons. Everybody
may go to the d  1 so long as sou
save your own souls.'

But  was it sin, Cole ?' asked Freshfield
wistfully.

Was what sin ? ' said the other.

My living with Phyllida. She believed
herself free : I believed her to be so, and I
cannot think that an Almighty Father will
punish an unintentional error. If we sinned,
it was not with our eyes open. No ; it is
the concealment she used towards me that
hurts me so terribly. If I can see her soul
purged of that, I shall be content'

And so you have come up to London, I
suppose, to find her out, and bring her down
on her knees for confession ? Her husband
is to be turned into her missionary, and treat
her to a medley of passion and penitence,
till the poor child will be totally unable to
distinguish right from wrong. No, no, it
must not be. I knew the girl in America,
and I won't have her trifled with. You've
renounced her  I don't question your right
to do so, perhaps she is everything that is
bad ; but let the renunciations be final. There
are plenty of parsons In the world beside
yourself; and there is no need for you to go
running after Phyllida Moss, and doubling
her misery for the purpose of converting her.'

Bernard stared at his old friend in amazement.
He hardly knew him. Nelson Cole,
who had always appeared so hardheaded,
cynical and ' cute,' was now working himself
up into something very much like a passion,
and on behalf of a girl whose Condition he
had been the very one to bring about.

I don't understand you,' replied Bernard ;
 in the first place, you are bringing accusations
against me without any cause ; in the
second, you condemn me unheard. Was it
/, Cole, who turned my poor girl out of
doors, or pronounced her unfit to hold the
position she did at Briarwood ? Why, the
blow has nearly killed me, and after a day
and night of torture, I came here to tell you
that I have made up my mind, at all hazards,
to find her again, and persuade her to become
my wife.'

Nelson Cole pushed the hair off his forehead,
and looked up into his friend's face
critically.

Is that so ? ' he asked incredulously ; ' and
have you well considered what taking Phyllis
back again means in your profession
and your family 1 '

I have considered nothing but my own
good and her's  we love each other, Cole 
we belong to each other  we stand alone
and apart  two in one, inseparable  indivisible

 not, mark you, because the law made us
so, but because our hearts were joined before
our hands. I have been very angry and
very shocked. I don't deny it. Your revelations
seemed at first to have made a ofulf
between us that nothing could again bridge
over ; but I am calmer now. I can regard
things in a truer light ; and I see that my
life and her's will be spoiled if they do not
come together again. You laughed at me
once for writing and talking of my soul's
mate. But it was true. I found her in
Phyllida, and in spite of everything she is
mine, and she must remain so.'

You intend to marry her again ? '

I intend, please God, to marry her
again.'

Nelson Cole leapt from his chair and
seized Bernard's hand.

God bless you, my boy ! God bless you ! '
he exclaimed. ' You have lifted a weight
off my mind.'

How could I imagine,' returned Bernard,

that you would receive my news like
this  you who were so hard upon her 
Cole?'

No, not hard, not hard. Was I ? Poor
child ! poor child ! ' replied the other man.

But if so, I am thankful you have the
strength to remedy the harm I did her. Ah,
Bernard, she loves you. I could envy you,
my boy, for being so much loved, but I will
not, for you deserve it. Only guard and
protect her from herself for the future, and I
will believe that for you at least there is a
heaven and a reward laid up in it.'

Then perceiving the look of utter astonishment
with which his friend still regarded
him, and suddenly remembering that he was
talking in a very different strain from what
he usually employed. Nelson Cole drifted
into a sort of apology for his words.

I daresay I seem to be talking a great
deal of nonsense to you ; but the fact is,
Bernard, I found out the other day, from a
conversation I had with Jack Neville, that

VOL. III. M

Phyllida Is the daughter of an old friend of
mine.'

What ! Do you mean the wife of the man
Macpherson, whom Neville mentioned to us?'

Nelson Cole winced.

Yes  his  his  wife. You are rioht. I
find that I knew her, ages ago, and it has
made me feel a great interest in the daughter.
And you really mean to take her back ?
You are not afraid of any more facts cropping
up to nip your new-born resolution in
the bud ? '

I could be afraid but of one thing, Cole,
and that would be any uncertainty respecting
her husband's death. You are sure that
he is dead ? '

I am sure. I have made inquiries since
I saw you last. The rascal was too well
known to be able to pretend to die. He
died in the Tombs, cheating justice to the
last, as he had ever done.'

Then I breathe freely, Cole, and Phyllida
will be my own again.'

But she may have done worse than that,
remember,' said Cole, wishing to test the
sincerity of Bernard's resolution. * She was
on the stao;-e for a twelvemonth, and I won't
be responsible for anything that happened
to her during that period. Suppose she had
half a score of lovers,  eh ? '

Bernard bit his lip, but answered calmly, 

I have determined that all bygones
shall be bygones. If Phyllida consents to
be my wife, we will begin afresh from the
moment of our marriage. She will never
find me calling her to account for what took
place before I knew her.'

Few men are so generous as that,' said
Cole, with a touch of his old sarcasm.

Cole,' replied Bernard earnestly, ' don't
you think that we men are rather hard, as a
rule, upon our women. We allow ourselves
every licence, but we call on them to be Immaculate.
They must not only be modest
and single-minded, but they must live as
though they were perfectly passionless and

without feeling of any sort. Since I have
entered the Church, men have naturally
been more shy of bestowing their worldly
confidences on me, but when I was a wild
young fellow at Oxford, and up to any kind
of spree myself, I used to hear and see
what married men did when away from their
wives, and even then, careless as I was, it
shocked me. I used to think how surprised
those men would be if, when they went
home, their wives (having become aware of
their behaviour) refused to receive them ;
and yet what would they have said if the
same infidelities had been practised in their
absence. They Avould have called their
women by every foul name they could think
of, and declare them unfit to be the wives of
honest men. And the law would have upheld
them. But there is another law than
that of man. Cole, and I am trying hard to
look at this matter according to the law of
God.'

Well, I believe, for your satisfaction,

that Phyllida was always as good as
gold in that respect ; but she got tipsy
one night  there is no doubt of that.
You heard Jack Neville confirm my statement.'


Bernard was racine before him with
dreamy eyes.

Because she heard that the brute to
whom she was tied was locked up, and she
would be free from his persecution for two
years,' he answered. ' Poor child ! How
she mist have suffered to create such
a reaction ! '

Oh, that's the way you take it ; but
isn't there just a chance of her relapsing ? '

Do you think so ? ' cried Bernard, with
sudden energy, springing to his feet. ' Oh
no, no  not whilst my arms are round her
to save her ! My poor darling !  my poor
betrayed and outcast Phyllida ! If any
such terrible harm should follow that one
fall to degradation, it will be laid at his
door, not hers  at the door of him with

whom she was forced into an unholy marriage
; and I will fight for her and with
her until we have stamped out the last foul
memento of that horrible sacrifice. Oh
no, Cole, don't think it. She cannot  she
shall not fall again, with my love standing
between her and temptation ! '

Nelson Cole seized both his hands and
held them as if they were in a vice.

My boy ! ' he exclaimed -  ' my noble-hearted
boy ! The woman who mates with
you should be an angel.'

She shall be one said Bernard, ' if the
prayers of a lifetime can make her so.
Don't tell me any more of her past ; let
us think only of her future. She is more
to me a great deal than the love of my
heart ; she is a soul that God has put into
my hands to save.'

And Bernard looked like a saint as he
pronounced the words.

His friend wrung his hands again and
sat down ; then they both laid their enthusiasm

aside for a while and became
practical.

I was only testing the stuff you were
made of,' said Cole, ' and you have come
nobly out of the trial ; and now to business,
Bernard. Do you know where that
poor girl is .' '

Indeed, I do not. I am here to ask you
to help me trace her.'

I have been thinking about her a orreat

o o

deal since we parted, and I imagine that
old lady, Mrs Penfold, will be better able
to find her than ourselves. Didn't you
tell me she was very kind to Phyllida at
the time of your marriage } '

Very kind, indeed. We were married
from her house in Gatehead.'

Don't you think it is probable that Phyllis
might again seek a shelter with her
cousin at Gatehead } '

Perhaps so ; but Mrs Penfold is still at
Bluemere. She is staying with her sister,
Mrs Pinner.'

Write to her, then, and ask her to go
home, and be ready to receive PhylHda
there. Then we will advertise as if from
her cousin, beoQinof the sirl to return to her
protection. I think we shall catch her that
way. Of course we could put the matter
into the hands of detectives ; but the less
publicity about these domestic affairs the
better.'

Bernard, taking his friend's advice, wrote
to Mrs Penfold to Bluemere ; but as she
had already left Mrs Pinner's, the letter was
forwarded to Gatehead, and reached there
the very morning that the following lines
appeared in the Standard, in answer to
Mrs Penfold's advertisement : 

Phyllida to Gateshead.  / cannot accept
your offer. By-and-by, zuhen I am independent,
I may see yoti agaiii, but riot now.
Many, majiy thanks, and may God bless you.'

Mrs Penfold cut out the advertisement,

and enclosed it in a letter (which might
have been a chapter out of the Lamentations
of Jeremiah) to Bernard, who immediately
carried it to Nelson Cole.

Independent , indeed ! ' exclaimed the latter.
How is such a child to make herself independent
in a howling wilderness like
London, unless it be by returning to the
stage, and she will find a difficulty in
done that. She is sure to look in the
Standard again for another appeal, Bernard.
We will insert one that is certain to bring
an answer.'

But how will that enable us to ascertain
her address ? ' asked Bernard anxiously.
Each day that we are separated now
seems like a purgatory to me.'

Patience, my son, patience. All things
come to him who knows how to wait. This
is the sort of thing I should advise you to
insert in the paper : 

\'' Gatehead to Phyllida.  Mr F. has con-suited

me about putting the case in the hands
of the police. Do you wish hint to find out
yotcr address or not f "

'And what do you expect her to reply to
this ? ' asked Bernard ruefully. ' She will
only say "No." I feel that the shock of
discovery has driven her from me for ever.'

Bernard, my boy, you're a very good
'* cuss," but I calculate you've not been
raised " in the States. This message will be
in Phyllida's hands tomorrow at latest, and
she will be in a regular fix about the police.
Nothing frightens a woman like the law.'

But what's the good of frightening her,
poor darling ? '

I'm coming to that, my son. The first
effect of her fright will be to make her
rush to the Standard office with an answer
to the advertisement. She will write to beg
Mrs Penfold to prevent her from seeing
you.'

Well '

Well, I guess I shall have my eye on
that office all the day, and when she appears
to insert her advertisement, I shall drop
down upon her  sharp.'

Oh, Cole, tomorrow  actually to-sorrow f
Is it possible that tomorrow I shall hold
her in my arms again ? '

Possible, but only possible. Suppose she
refuses to accompany me home ? '

Surely she will not refuse when she hears
how we honos to have her back aQ-ain.'

Don't know. Women are fickle cattle
to shoe behind. But if she accompanies
me here, she may refuse to see yo2t'

Oh no, no. She loves me. Cole, believe
me. She must yearn for me as much
as I do for her.'

Good ; but then there is another risk
of failure  so don't be too sanguine. She
may not go to the office herself, but send
a messenger.'

And in that case, what shall we do ? *
asked Bernard mournfully.

In that case, my chum, we must try
the effect of another advertisement. But
let us see what tomorrow will bring forth
first'

The two men passed that evening together
with a certain degree of cheerfulness,
but Bernard was not too much absorbed in
his own troubles, to observe that Nelson
Cole looked forward to the morrow with
almost as much anxiety as himself. It was
with difficulty when the morning arrived
that he could let him start on his quest
alone  he was so sure that if he stood on
the opposite side of the way, or up the
next street, or under a door-way  that
Phyllida would not perceive him until it
was too late to make her escape. But
Nelson Cole would not hear of his accompanying
him, and made him promise into
the bargain to keep to his own rooms in
the hotel, until he was invited to enter those
of his friend. And so the unfortunate
parson, left behind in that state of mind

when It is quite impossible to fix the attention
upon anything, threw books and papers
consecutively to one side, and ended by
casting himself, face downwards, upon the
bed whilst he worked up his brain to a pitch
of madness, by reviewing all the happiest
scenes he had passed through with Phyllida,
and trying to realise what would become of
him if they never occurred again.

Meanwhile Nelson Cole took up his
station opposite the office of the Standard
paper, and watched carefully all who went
in or came out. He felt more certain of
success than he had confided to Bernard, for
several reasons of his own. In the first
place, he argued that when women are very
anxious about a thing, they always like to doit
themselves  they will not believe that
any one else can do it so well ; and secondly,
Phyllida was a stranger in London, and not
aware perhaps of how easily an advertisement
can be sent, with a few stamps, through
the post ; and thirdly, she was not likely to

be In a position to command the services of
any one to do the errand for her. So he
kept up a steady tramp on the opposite
pavement with his keen eye watching the
approaches from every quarter. About two
o'clock she came, dressed In her serge
costume, pale as a sheet, and with dark
-circles under her eyes, but still Phyllida, and
looking so lovely that every man's head
turned to gaze after her as she passed.
She came on fearlessly, though evidently
labouring under the deepest depression.
But she had no Idea that any one In that
vast crowd would single her out for notice,
and when Nelson Cole, crossing the road,
placed his hand upon her arm and said
the word ' Nestle,' he frightened her so
that she screamed. That name reminded
her of all that was most terrible In her
young life, and she turned about, half-expecting
to see the face of Candle Macpherson
scowling at her, or the ghost of
Fernan Cortes at her elbow. And when

she recognised Nelson Cole, she seemed
hardly less alarmed.

Oh, Mr Cole, why are you here ?
Why do you call me by that name ? '

I came here solely to find you, child, and
I called you bessie' because I knew your
mother, and I used to call her so.'

You knew my mother, and yet you told
///;;/ of me. Oh, I do not believe it. You
are making some pretence in order to dome
further harm. Let me go, Mr Cole ;
pray, let me go. I never wish to see or
speak to you again.'

< Phyllida,' said Nelson Cole earnestly,
 will you believe me when I tell you, that I
Lavish now I had been dead before I confessed
that you were recognised. But it
is too late now for regret. Let me try therefore
to make you some amends. You have
said that I was kind to you once  '

Oh yes, you were indeed,' she interrupted
him gratefully ; ' what should I have
done if you had not come to my rescue at

that miserable time in Chicago ? Why, I
never could have left the city. I could not
have come to England  I should not have
seen him. Ah !  ' and here Phyllida put her
hand against her side as though to still a
sudden pain.

My poor child, you think after all,
perhaps, that that did not turn out such a
kindness. Well, well, never mind it now.
I thought I saw my duty plain before me,
but you were a little goose not to take my
advice and tell Bernard yourself. But,
Nessie  '

Not Nessie, Mr Cole, pray not Nessie.'

Phyllida, then, if you prefer it, come
back with me to my hotel, Phyllida, and
let us talk matters over quietly.'

There is nothing to talk over, sir, and
there is nothing to be done. I have disgraced
him without remedy, and the sooner
he and his friends forget my existence the
better.'

But I am of a different opinion. I have

been talking with Jack Neville since I was
at Briarwood. Do you know, by the way,
that your old friend Jack is in town ?'

Phyllida slightly shuddered.

No, Mr Cole, I had not heard it before ;
but I would rather not see him. He will
remind me of the past'

I had no intention of proposing it, only
I found out from what he told me that I
had been acquainted with your mother,
Mrs Moss (as she called herself), and you
are very like her, Phyllida  very like. I
know now what it is in your face that
attracted me from the first.'

But to Phyllida it was evidently a matter
of complete indifference whether Mr Cole
was attracted by her or not. She moved
uneasily from his side, trying to elude him.

Will you let me pass into the office,
Mr Cole ? I have business here.'

What is your business ? To insert an
advertisement in the Standard?' Don't
throw away your money, Phyllida ; you

VOL. III. N

must have little enough, because I tell you
it will be useless.'

She looked at him in astonishment.

How can you know what my advertisement
is about ? '

I don't know the words of it, but I am
sure of the substance. It is to entreat
your cousin, Mrs Penfold, not to let Bernard
Freshfield put the detectives on your
track, and I can help you in that matter
better than twenty Mrs Tenfold.'

How can you do so ?' she asked faintly. -

Because Bernard will not act without
consulting me, in fact the business will be
put into my hands to work as I choose.
Now, Phyllida, I will make a compact with
you. Come home with me and let us
talk quietly over the matter, and I promise
Bernard shall not have your address
until you give it him yourself. Is it a
bargain ? '

Yes, I will go with you,' she said ; for
she was dying to hear all about her husband,

and how he had borne the revelations
which had been made to him.

She stood quietly enough by Cole's side
until he had hailed a cab and placed her
in it ; but as soon as they were driving
towards his hotel, she startled him by
hiding her face upon his arm and bursting
into a flood of tears.

Oh, Mr Cole,' she sobbed, ' I don't
bear you any enmity  indeed I don't  for
I know it was your duty to tell him ; and
it was to my shame that he should have
been kept in ignorance so long. But my
heart is breaking  indeed  indeed it is ! '

'Hush, Phyllida! Hush, my child he
found himself saying, in the most paternal
manner, as he smoothed the long tresses
which had fallen from under her hat.

I did not dream I was doing him an
injury,' she went on, weeping ; ' how should
I ? I didn't know that anybody considered a
divorce illegal. And, Mr Cole, I was never
really married to that other man ; for I ran

away from him the very same day that my
father forced me into it, and hid in a digger's
hut until Cortes had left the valley. So I
believed I was quite  qtiite free  to do as I
chose.'

Yes, yes ; I understand it all now
replied Cole soothingly ; ' and so will he,
some day. I will take care that he does.
But you must try and compose yourself,
Phyllida, for here we are, close to my
hotel, and you would not like the waiters
to see you in this condition.'

She drew herself up then, and dried her
tears, and pulled her veil over her face,
and walked up to his private sitting-room
with a dignity of which he had hardly
thought her capable ; and Jack Neville's
assertion that ' Nessie always looked like
a lady' came back to his mind as he
watched her.

'And now,' he commenced, when they
had seated themselves, ' tell me first what
you intend to do.'

I am going back to the stage, Mr Cole.
I find my style of acting is all the rage
in London just now, and I have already
had a very favourable interview with one of
the managers.'

Yes, I suppose you will get an engagement,
Stephanie, if it is only for your
beauty. But of course, then, you have
relinquished all idea of returning to Bernard
Freshfield ? '

She gave a sudden cry, and put up her
hand to her face.

'Oh, Mr Cole, don't! You know that
he would not take me back.'

I am not so sure of it. He is very
much attached to you, and I believe he
would be ready to condone everything if
you wished to return.'

'Oh, I couldn't  I couldn't! He may
think so now in the first agony of parting ;
but he would say differently when we had
settled down into a quiet life again. Think
what I have done to him  he who is so good,

so pure, so pious, so fond of his mother and
sister, so anxious to do honour to his profession.
I went amongst them all as his wife ;
I took all the privileges of a wife, and the
respect and esteem. And what has It
ended In ? That he doesn't believe me
to have been free till Cortes died, and
that for six months I betrayed him (by
my cowardice in not telling the truth) Into
the commission of a sin for which he must
look on me with abhorrence, I  I  who
would have died for him,' she continued,
with a fresh burst of grief.

Listen to me, my dear,' replied Cole,
all that you say Is very true, and had you
not believed yourself to be free, and deceived
him Into thinking you so, I daresay
this would have been an awkward matter
to mend. But I have talked with poor
Bernard on the subject, and however
grieved he may be (and he has been
terribly cut up about it), he absolves you
from blame in the matter.'

He absolves me!' she repeated with surprise.
' Does that mean he thinks I was
right ? '

Not quite that, PhylHda. He regrets
deeply that you were not more open with
him, but he does not consider the injury
has been so great as to prevent your
living together again. Bernard wants you
to return to him.'

A gleam of joy shot over her countenance,
but it was immediately succeeded by
her former gloom.

He is wrong,' she answered, ' even to
wish it. Nothing can unmake me. I was
never fit to become one of his family ; and
on looking back, I think I was mad ever
to think of it.'

But if your husband desires you to
return, it becomes your duty to do so.'

He is not my husband,' replied Phyllida.

My dear, I think that question is open
to doubt. If your divorce was a legal one,
he is at any rate your husband by law.'

My Inkstand by law ! ' she echoed ; ' oh,
Mr Cole, you don't know Bernard if you
can speak of him like that ; you don't know
what Bernard can make a woman feel a
husband to be, if you can name the name
In the same breath as law. Do you
imagine I could endure to know myself
to be his wife by law, and miss all the
holiness and sanctity which made the title
sound like a blessing to me every time
he uttered it ? Do you think I could
accept what the law would give me, and
know that the esteem and love which he
showered on me (but which I had no
right to take from him) were dead and
gone for ever ? '

Perhaps not ; but supposing they are
not dead ? '

I should bring him to shame all the
same. I should cause him to be pitied by
his neighbours and avoided by his relations.
Fancy a parson with a wife whose antecedents
must not be Inquired into. Oh,

Mr Cole, do not let him find me out ; persuade
him to leave me alone. He shall
never be troubled again by so much as
the mention of my name, for I will not let
people know that we have ever met.'

I don't think Bernard will consent to
that,' replied Cole gravely. He was beginning
to fear that the task he had taken
on himself would prove a less easy one than
he had imagined.

But he must  he must ! ' cried Phyllida
wildly. ' I will not meet him ; I will not
speak to him. I have been a curse upon
his life, and if my heart breaks under the
ordeal, I will separate myself from him forever
; and were I to see him come into this
room this very moment, I would  Ah !  '

But at this juncture Phyllida turned, and
seeing Bernard himself standing on the
threshold, gave a shriek of joy and flew into
his arms.

Hang you, Bernard ! ' cried Nelson Cole,
with affected anger, ' I thought I desired

you to remain in your own rooms until I
requested the pleasure of your company
here.'

But he might have talked for ever before
the lovers would have heard a word of what
he said.

Forgive me, love, forgive me ! ' Phyllida
was crying, as, having slid from Bernard's
arms, she fell at his feet, and twisted herself
like a snake about his knees; 'I did not know
what I was doing ; I never thought that I
was Injuring you ; I saw only one thing,
and that was my love, which would have
led me to die for you if my death could
have done you any good. Oh, say you
forgive me  you who first taught me that
there is forgiveness for the worst of sinners
say that you do not believe that I wilfully
deceived you  that you will not curse
me for having blighted all your hopes In life ?'

I will say nothing, my Phyllida,' returned
Bernard, as he attempted to raise her from
the ground, ' until you come to my heart 

to your rightful resting-place  and tell me
what you wish from there.'

Oh, Bernard, I am not worthy.'

If you are not worthy, no woman is.
It is your home, dearest, by the rights of
our mutual love, and until you come home,
I will not speak to you.'

Then she suffered him to lift her drooping
form, and clasp it in his arms, and
their lips met, as if there had been no
stain between them, and she had been the
daughter of a duke instead of a disreputable
gold digger, who kept a gaming-table
in the Valley of Sacramento.

You know all  all she whispered.

All, dearest, except one thing which
I wait to learn from your own lips.
There has been an irregularity in our
marriage, Phyllida. Will you marry me
over again ? '

Over again ? ' she repeated, startled at
the idea of so much happiness.

Yes, over again. You are free now,.

by the universal Law of Death  and asa
free woman, I offer you my hand.
Will you accept it, Phyllida ? '

Oh, Mr Cole she exclaimed, turning
to their mutual friend, ' tell Bernard
this must not be. Tell him of what we
were talking before he came in.'

Well, my dear, I don't know of what
you were talking, unless it was of your
determination never to see nor speak to
bim again. And if you are going to
leep your other resolutions as well as
you did that one, why, I don't think you
require any interference on my part.'

She reddened and was silent.

'Phyllida,' said Bernard, 'we don't
want Nelson Cole nor any one else to
settle our affairs for us. You are my
wife, darling  I can never regard you
in any other light  and if you won't come
back to me, I shall have to walk through
life alone, for I certainly should never think
myself justified in marrying any one else.'

There now, you see,' interposed Cole,
if you don't marry him, Phyllida, you'll
have another set of sins upon your head
and by your own account you can't afford
that.'

But your mother and Laura ? ' said
Phyllida timidly to Bernard.

Laura is only too anxious to see us
re-united, darling,  and as for my motherwell,
she is my mother, and not my wife.'

'But the Bluemere people?' continued
the girl with a shudder.

I shall not take you back to Blue
mere, or at all events not for some time.
We will have a holiday first, and enjoy
some travelling together.'

Come over the duck pond with me,'
said Cole ; ' there's lots of sight-seeing for
you in the States.'

Done with you ! ' exclaimed Bernard
heartily. ' If Phyllida agrees, so do L
And now, my love, when is this marriage
to be ? '

When you like, dear Bernard.'

I should like to-day, but as I suppose
it's too late, I like tomorrow. I have a
brother parson close at hand to whom I
will explain matters, and he will do it as
privately for us as possible. You will
some with us, Cole ? '

Oh, yes,' returned Cole gruffly ; * as I
was the cause of the split, I should like
to see the knot tied again, and give the
bride away. And don't you think it
would be kind to telegraph the intelligence
to Mrs Penfold and ask her and
the old captain she writes about to join
us at luncheon afterwards.'

Oh, yes ; let us have cousin Penfold,
by all means,' said Bernard. 'I owe the
old lady another sealskin cloak for the
rapidity with which she advertised for my
darling.'

And now, Phyllida,' said Nelson Cole,
 I had better see you home, and Bernard
can let you know the time and place for

to - morrow's meeting by this evening's
post'

Oh, can't she stay the evening, and
dine with us ? ' asked Bernard, in a tone
of injury.

No ; she is tired out with all this excitement
; she will be much better at
home.'

Let me go with her, then,' replied the
other eagerly.

You will do no such thing ; I shall
take her myself,' was the curt rejoinder ;
and Nelson Cole began to hurry Phyllida
from the room.

She flung herself once more into her
husband's arms, and then turning to Cole,
she caught his hand and timidly raised it
to her lips.

How can I ever thank you,' she murmured,
* for bringing me home again ? '

Won't you give him a better one than
that, Phyllida ?  he deserves it,' said Bernard,
laughing.

The girl raised her head, and kissed
Cole upon the forehead ; and as he felt
the touch of her lips, the blood mounted
to his face as if he had been a boy.

Fancy, a kiss from Agnes's child making
me feel like that ! ' he grumbled to
himself in a cynical manner, as he hurried
after her down to the cab which was waiting
to convey them to her home. He was
ready to laugh at himself for his weakness,
and yet the remembrance of Phyllida's kiss
was with him through his dreams.

The next morning was as bright as the
season could contrive to make it, and the
three people who went to church so early,
and returned to the hotel in time to greet
Mrs Penfold and Captain Barclay on their
arrival from Gatehead, could not have looked
brighter had it been a morning In the leafy
June.

'Not In black this time, my dear,' whispered
Mrs Penfold approvingly, when the
two gentlemen had taken possession of the

nice, bluff old captain, and she had a moment
alone with Phyllida.

'Oh no, cousin Tenfold replied the girl,
smiling, as she contemplated her soft grey
velvet dress. ' Dear Berne telegraphed
yesterday for Mrs Garnett to send up some
of my things. He said we wouldn't have
any mistake this time. Oh ! he is so good
to me, and after all that I have done. I
feel so happy, cousin  just as if it was too
much to bear, and I must die.'

Oh no, my dear, you mustn't say that,'
replied Mrs Penfold, who took everything
she heard ct pied de la letUe. ' Mr Fresh-field
was good enough to write and tell me
all about you, and though I don't say you
ought not to have told us of your former
marriage, yet it's all over now, thank
heaven ! and certainly no one has a better
right to Mr Freshfield than yourself. Ah,
all marriages have their twofold aspects,
and you have found out the truth already.
Well, well,' and Mrs Penfold sighed in a

VOL. III. o

mysterious manner, which seemed to say,
Do ask me a Httle more about it'

Phyllida took the hint.

What is it, dear cousin ? Your marriage
was happy enough, I know, for you have
often told me so.'

Yes, my dear, so long as it lasted,' replied
Mrs Penfold, still mysteriously.

You would like it to come over again ? '
said Phyllida sympathisingly, and with a
happy glance at her Bernard.

I should indeed, my dear ; but what-would
people say ? I shall be fifty-two
next birthday, remember.'

Dear cousin, what do you mean ? '

Why, my dear, I thought you would
have guessed it, from his interest in you and
so forth. Captain Barclay, a thorough
gentleman. Royal Navy, you know, Phyllis
 none of your merchant services, my
dear ; but, then, as 1 tell him, " Captain,
what would the world say 1 " '

A light broke in on Phyllida.

'Is It true ? Oh, I am glad ! Never
mind the world, cousin Penfold. Think of
yourselves, and what your hearts say ; that
is the only thing worth a moment's consideration.
Take a lesson from my Bernard.
You see how little he cares for the
world ; and he Is so good  so perfect.
And a true marriage is such a holy thing.
Oh, I think you will be very happy with
the dear old captain, and I am sure that he
is nice.'

Ah, he is that, my dear  essentially nice,
and has become so used to my ways that
he cannot eat his dinner unless I cook it,
nor sleep at night unless I make his bed.
So I hope I shall make him comfortable in
his last days ; and our little incomes put
together will enable us to keep the house
entirely for ourselves. I shall not dare
tell my sister Charlotte until it is all over ;
but I felt I should like to hear you say,
Phyllida, that you consider the plan a good
one.'

I consider It the very best plan In all
the world cried Phylllda heartily ; but as
she spoke the door was flung open, and
before the waiter could announce the coming
visitors, she found herself clasped in
Laura's arms.

Phyllida, my dear, dear sister. My
darling Phyllida, have you really come home
again ? ' exclaimed Laura in an outburst of
affection and kisses, as she strained her
sister-in-law to her heart.

Yes, yes, I am home for ever now'
returned Phyllida ; ' we have just come
back from church. We have been married
again this morning ; ' and the two girls
cried together for joy.

But please to explain your presence here,'
said Bernard, when the excitement had
somewhat subsided. ' We are delighted,
Laurie, to welcome you and dear old Anderson
to our wedding-breakfast, but I confess
I should like to understand why you two
giddy young creatures are running about

London together, and what brought you
up from Bluemere on this particular day ? '

'Why, where are mamma and the Muck-keeps
? ' exclaimed Laura suddenly, looking
round for them.

We have not seen them. Did you
expect to meet them here ? ' replied her
brother.

They started for London an hour before
we did, that is what made Charlie
bring me up to you, Bernard, because we
feared  we were not quite sure, that is to
say, how you would like the intrusion of
strangers at such a time. Where can
they be ? I am astonished they have not
yet arrived. They must have mistaken the
hotel.'

At the idea of her mother-in-law's appearance,
Phyllida turned pale and crept to her
husband's side. Bernard put his arm firmly
round her.

Never mind,' he said cheerfully, ' weare
not going to wait luncheon for them,

I can answer for that, for I ate no breakfast
this morning, and am as hungry as a
hunter. So, my dear friends, will you take
your places  (ah ! Charlie, how good it is to
see yottr face here, my boy)  and join my
heart in its thanksgiving for the very
happiest meal I've ever sat down to.'

The waiters, who had been busy spreading
the table whilst this conversation was
carried on, now announced that all was
ready, and the party sat down to luncheon.
How merry they were ; and yet not so
merry perhaps as cheerful, for though
Laura blushed and giggled a good deal,
remembering the scene that had taken
place at Blue Mount that morning, and
Mrs Penfold simpered in a matronly way
under the attentions of Captain Barclay,
Phyllida's sweet face turned paler and
paler as the moments went on, and each
one brought nearer to her the dreaded
advent of Mrs Freshfield ; and Bernard
also, although he felt brave as a lion in

defence of his young wife, wished heartily
that the anticipation of the interview had
not spoiled their luncheon. At last, however,
as the meal had nearly drawn to a
conclusion, it came. A querulous voice
was heard approaching by the vast staircases
of the hotel that led to their apartments,
and Laura and Bernard simultaneously
exclaimed, ' My mother ! ' The waiter
in attendance heard them, and threw open
the door, and Mrs Freshfield appeared
first upon the threshold, transfixed at the
scene that met her view.

What is this ? ' she exclaimed angrily,
as her eyes rapidly took in the presence
of Laura and Mr Anderson and the rest
of the wedding guests.

This, mother,' replied Bernard, as, holding
his wife's hand firmly in his own, he
rose to his feet to confront her, ' is my
wedding breakfast ; Phyllida and I have
been married again this morning.'

'Married again!' gasped Mrs Fresh-field,

'and when I have travelled all this
distance at '}ny age to try and save you
from being once more shackled with the
chains of ungodliness ; when I and my dear
saintly friends, the Laird o' Muckheep
and his blessed sister, have hastened hereat
the call of duty to try and snatch
you as a brand from the burning, to find
you once more in the power of Satan, is
indeed too hard.'

Hadn't you better have some luncheon,
now you are here ? ' replied her son practically.


Hoot, Mrs Frail-field,' exclaimed the
voice of Miss Janet, somewhere from the
background, ' diana I tell ye it was rai-sh
to leave Bluemere without the free-teen
dirairc-tions in your han' o' the loose wheel
yon misguided young mon had heeded himsel'.
If ye had taken my advice, ye woudna
ha' dree-even my brother an' myself' round
Loon-don for mair than twa hours whiles
ye tried to re-carl the seem o' the street.

an' ye wood ha' been in time, maybe, to
raise-cue seem fra' the weeks o' the evil
one.'

Mother,' said Bernard, ' if you and your
friends Hke to take your places amongst
us as friends, we shall be glad to see you ;
but if you have journeyed to town for the
express purpose of insulting me and my
wife, the sooner you go back to Bluemere
the better.'

Oh, sir,' exclaimed Mrs Freshfield, turning
to some one who stood behind her,
can you not say a word in season to my
unhappy son ? '

'Ay,' replied the voice of the Laird o'
Muckheep, ' when I can see him, madam,
mebbe I shall be auld the rest thing to
say to touch his hair ; but at this moment,
Mrs Frail-field, it's nothing I can see but
the too o' your ane bonnet.'

I beg you ten thousand pardons,' said
Mrs Freshfield, as she made way for the
laird to appear upon the threshold ; ' in

my terrible grief and disappointment I
could think of nothing but myself.'

But at the sound of the laird's voice,
Phyllida had risen suddenly to her feet and
clung to her husband, almost convulsively. 

What Is It, my darling ? What do you
fear ? ' Bernard was saying tenderly, when
his mother's saintly friend came to the
front.

See, see ! ' shrieked Phyllida, as she
pointed to him ; ' I knew It was he. I
recognised him from his voice. There
stands my father

She did not hide her face, but she
pressed It close against her husband's
breast, whilst her eyes glowed like living
coals, and every feature was expressive of
the keenest horror.

Your father I ' repeated Bernard. But
by this time a fearful oath had rung
through the room  such an oath as comes
from the lips of a man, but seldom In his
lifetime  such an oath as the condemned

felon in the dock might level at the one
who had been the cause of his standing
there, and it had issued from the lips of
Nelson Cole.

Sandie Macpherson, by all that's holy ! '
he exclaimed as he started to his feet.

The Laird o' Muckheep turned livid 
the sweat started to his forehead, and his
limbs shook under him. Miss Janet was
the first to come to the rescue.

Hoot, mon,' she cried, ' ye cinna ken
wha ye speak to  Sandie Macpherson, indeed.
It's my brother, the Laird o' Muck-keep,
wha Stan's befoor ye ; a mon whales
spencer his life in bringing back hairs
souls to the ane food. What wood ye
ha' in calling' the laird by sic a seem as
that ? '

The Laird of Muckheep ? ' cried Phyllida ;
it is not true. His name is Macpherson,
and he is the greatest enemy I ever had.
There stands the man, and let him look
me in the eyes and deny it if he dare,

who forced me to marry his colleague
Fernan Cortes, for fear I should betray the
murder I saw them commit between them.'

At the word ' murder! which sends a
thrill through every breast, the luncheon
party rose to their feet simultaneously, and
shrank in horror from the man who stood
in their midst.

Ye bold-faced lizzy,' interposed Miss
Janet, 'to ca' the Laird o' Muckheep out
o' his ain respected name.'

I don't know what his own name maybe,'
continued Phyllida, ' for he has had a
dozen names to my knowledge, but he
knows that what I say is true. He knows
that I saw him hold Norris the Englishman
down by the arms, whilst Cortes
stabbed him in the back with his bowie-knife,
and that when I threatened to expose
his villainy, he locked me up in a
room until he brought a man to marry
me to Cortes, and that he had to hold
me himself whilst the vile ceremony was

performed. Answer me, Macpherson,' cried
the girl, with eyes of fire, * Is it not the
truth that I am telling now ? '

Phylhda, he is too much of a cur todo
you justice,' exclaimed Nelson Cole ;
it is a man alone who ought to deal
with him, and it is a man who will bring
him to his knees. Do you know me,
Sandie Macpherson?' he said in a voice
of thunder, as he strode up to the quondam
gold-digger of Sacramento Valley, and
glared in his face, * Do you know me
Nelson Cole ? Answer that.'

Macpherson glanced round the room once
or twice uneasily, and then made a bolt for
the door. But Cole had already pinioned
his arms from behind.

No, my friend,' he said, shaking his head
over him, ' you don't leave us just yet, not
till I've finished with you at all events ; and
if you attempt any violence I will hand you
over at once to the police. I repeat my
question, Do you know me ? '

Of course I know you,' replied Macpherson
sullenly.

Of course you know me, and I will tell
this company why. Nineteen years ago,
ladies and gentlemen, this brute, writhing
in my grasp here, who has come to England
with a shorn face to profess piety, ran
away with my wife, Agnes Summers, whom I
had married in St Domingo the year
before.'

My mother ! ' exclaimed Phyllida.

Yes, child, your unhappy mother, who
appears to have expiated her error by a life
of suffering. Thank God she is at rest !
but you have still to answer to me, Sandie
Macpherson, for the wrong you did her. I
have tracked you round and round the States
for this alone ; I have watched and waited
for you in vain ; and now that you've dropped
into my mouth like a ripe plum at the time
I least expected it, you needn't think that I
will let you go without the punishment I
 have thirsted to give you.'

Oh, this must be some dreadful mistake,'
said Mrs Freshfield, sinking into a chair,
with her handkerchief to her eyes, ' to talk
of crime and punishment in connection with
a saint like the Laird o' Muckheep, and one
whose whole life has been spent in doing
good.'

Ech ! but these charles 'full discover their
mistake before lang, Mrs Frail-field ; an'
it's a terrible penalty they'll ha' to pee for
latin' violent hans upon the sacred pair-son
o' a Muckheep.'

Oh no, madam, do not flatter yourself
with such a false idea,' said Phyllida.
Who should know better than myself what
that miserable man is ? / who have the
misfortune to call him 'father!' He killed
my mother by a long course of cruelty
and violence. He sacrificed me, his only
child, to a man as wicked as himself to
conceal his own crime.'

You're no bairn o' mine,' interrupted
Macpherson with a scowl. ' Ay, Mr Cole,

but ye needna glare at me after sic a fashion.
Ye maun do what ye Hke wl' me noo ; I've
had my revenge on ye befoor-hand. Ye
diana lose onely your wife by my means,
for she brought your bairn along wI' her,
and for sixteen years she leered as my ain
daughter in the Sacramento Valley, and
there's many to testify to the truth o' that.'

Brute ! ' exclaimed Cole, as he nearly
shook the life out of him. ' Villain, devil !
Was It not sufficient to rob me of one Agnes
at a time ?'

Not his child ! ' cried Phyllida, In a transport
of delight. ' Oh, there may be some
chance of my redeeming the past yet. Not
belong to that vile, wicked man ! Bernard,
kiss me. I shall be a better woman than I
ever hoped to be.'

'What wood ye be coin' by me?' demanded
Macpherson, as Nelson Cole administered
a tremendous kick to his person.

What would I be doing by you } ' he
repeated scornfully. ' Why, I would like to

treat you as you treated her  to take your
life from you, drop by drop, and see you
die by inches in silent, hopeless agony. But
you are a brute, and I am a man, and I will
not forget that you have restored to me my
child.'

 Speer me ! ' said Macpherson, shivering
on his knees.

Spare you ? Did you spare my wife ?
Have you spared my daughter ? For what
reason should I spare you ? '

But she wasna' married to Cortes  it was
no a pair-son that I brought to per-fair the
ceremony. It was joist a tree-ck I played
to prevent the girl fra spleen-tin' on us.
And noo I ha' auld ye that, and ane gude
tarn deserves another.'

'Not a parson!' repeated Phyllida, 'not
married to Cortes ! and I ran away from him
the very same day. Oh ! Bernard, I am
indeed your own. How mercifully I have
been preserved for you.'

I will let you go, then,' said Nelson Cole,

VOL. III. p

addressing Macpherson, ' but not to pollute
this country with your presence. Leave
England, and never show your ugly face in
it again, or I will make the place too hot to
hold you

But ye ha nae proofs  ye canna hand
me over to the police said Macpherson
anxiously.

I can make the country ring with your
story though, until you are hounded like a
leper from the presence of every honest man.
And I will do it, excepting on that one condition.
Do you understand me . '

I do.'

Go, then, and take your sister with you.
We wish no remembrance left behind of the
injury you have caused so many here.'

He loosed the creature with a parting
shake as he spoke, and Miss Janet, taking
her cue from her brother's demeanour, slunk
after the Laird o' Muckheep from the room.
Then there was a silence, broken only by the
weeping of Mrs Freshfield  for every one

Phyllida. 227

felt that the next words would be sacred.
And so they rung out, like a clarion peal from
heaven upon the happy air, 

Father ! '

My own, own child.'

And Bernard took his wife and placed her
in the arms of Nelson Cole.
