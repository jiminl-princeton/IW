THE PROEM.

A man only understands that of which he has already the
beginnings in himself.'  Amiel's Journal.

I SUPPOSE If one were to look back over
one's past life that special days and hours
would glide out of the darkness and stand
out with almost mirage-like brightness against
the dusky background, where all manner of
confused childish fancies are hopelessly mingled
together ; that In our sober-eyed maturity we
should be at times startled by the ghost of our
child-life looking at us across the years with
a tender pathos and pity that would appeal
strongly to our inner consciousness.,

There Is something touching, even to a
commonplace mind, in. the memory of one's
childhood. Once upon a time we lived upon
enchanted ground ; we skimmed across our
own little plot of earth with irresponsible, birds

 2

like motion ; we were as giddy as insects in
the sunshine ; our world was peopled with
fairies ; all sorts of delightful miracles took
place before our eyes. True, the grown-up
people were a little tiresome  they invented
strange laws : to go to bed when one was not
sleepy, for example  but perhaps it was their
nature to be tiresome.

How well I remember a lite scene painted
on my memory in indelible colours ! I can
see it all so vividly  the brown wainscoted
parlour, bright with firelight ; outside, the snow
falling, a noiseless white shower. The rest of
the family had gone to church, grumbling and
protesting against the weather, and we two
children had been left to amuse each other,
Jem proud of being left in charge of his little
sister.

We were sitting huddled up together on the
low window-seat, with Fox's 'Book of Martyrs'
between us, and Jem was gloating over the
horribly realistic pictures with the relish of
boyish curiosity.

'Jem,' I exclaimed suddenly, 'when I grow
up I mean to be a martyr !'

Don't be a goose, Olga ! Look at this
fellow on the rack ; he must be a plucky one,
1 should say.'

'Don't show me any more pictures, please,*

I pleaded ; ' they make me feel bad. I am
thinking of that poor lady at the stake, and
how brave she was. Mother says it is a
grand thing to die for one's religion ; I heard
her say so to Hubert. When I am quite
grown up and as tall as mother I mean to bea
martyr.'

Oh, you silly !' and here Jem looked at me
with lofty contempt. * As though people were
burnt now !'

No, not here  not in England ; but among
the savages, Jem.'

Oh, oh ! it is a female missionary you would
be ! What a baby you are, Olga ! Why, you
cannot bear the least little bit of pain ! You
cried when your finger was pinched in the door
the other day. Hallo ! what are you about ?'
in an astonished voice. ' Oh, you ninny !'

But here Jem broke off to watch my proceedings
with breathless interest. Stung by
his boyish derision, and elevated by my vague
longing for martyrdom, I walked up to the
grate and thrust a small finger into the ruddy
flame.

Shall I ever forget the fierce smart, the hot,
throbbing anguish of the next moment ?

Oh, Jem, it hurts ! oh, I can't bear it!' and,
throwing myself on the rug. I burst into heartbroken
sobs.

It was long before Jem could comfort me ;
the smart of my scorched finger had entered
my childish soul. 1 had no longer any hope of
belonging to the company of celestial maidens
who had won their crowns. The desire was
there, but the pain was too terrible ; and there
was Jem wiping away my tears, and every
now and then breaking into a shout of boyish
laughter.

What a queer little thiner you are, Olga ! I
don't believe another child would have done it.'

'Don't tell Hubert,' I whispered, for Jem
was cuddling me so nicely that I was in a fairway
to be comforted.

I did not mind Jem laughing one bit while
his eyes looked so kind ; but if Hubert should
hear it ! Why did we always say that ? and
yet there were but three of us  Hubert and
Jem and I !

I wonder if the grown-up (Juga is so much
wiser than the child Olga, who scorched her
chubby finger in the desire to prove herself
strong enough for martyrdom. Sometimes
even now I have had wild dreams of self-sacrifice,
and then have shrunk back at the
mere thought of testing them. 'Oh, Jem, it
hurts; I cannot bear it!' I seem to hear the
old childish note of pain ringing in my ears
now. ' Olga, you are a dreamer of dreams,'

Hubert has said to me more than once, and
has quoted Kingsley's beautiful words, ' Do
noble things, not dream them all day long.'
Indeed, he recited the whole poem one day
to Kitty and me. Kitty sighed and said it
was very true, but I held my peace ; I loved
that little poem so. Jem and I knew it by
heart ; and Hubert had spoiled it by repeating
it in that measured voice. I never liked
Hubert to read poetry to me.

Jem often told me that I was unjust to
Hubert; that I did not make allowances for a
slow, quiet nature. I dare say he was right ;
but though I was fond of Hubert as an elder
brother, and tried to do my duty to him, and to
bear with Kitty for his sake, I could not love
him as I did Jem.

Hubert was a oreat deal older than either of
us ; he was a full-grown man when Jem was a
raw schoolboy. Several brothers and sisters
had come between us and had died in infancy.
On his deathbed my father had made Hubert
our guardian ; and when my mother died, and
Hubert married Kitty, he brought us to his
house. I remembered how Jem and I begged
to be allowed to live together, and how Hubert
pooh-poohed the notion in that grand way of
his.

Who ever heard of a couple of children

keeping house together ! Please don't cry
about it, Olga. Kitty and I hope to make
you very comfortable ; and there is the baby
to amuse you when Jem goes to Oxford.'

I am sure now that Hubert meant to be
kind, and that in his heart he was very sorry
for us. Neither then nor afterwards did he complain
of his added responsibilities ; he made
every possible arrangement for our comfort,
and I am bound to say that Kitty seconded
him. They both welcomed us in the kindest
manner, and took pains to show us that we
were not in the way ; indeed, Kitty tried very
hard to be a sister to me.

Six years had passed since Jem and I said
good-bye to our dear old home and went to
live at Fircroft. Things had changed much
since then. Kitty had ceased to be the Kitty
of old ; the dark-eyed, high-spirited girl who
had welcomed us with girlish good-nature had
developed into a pale, fretful Kitty, who had
lost all her kittenish roundness, and the bright
winning ways that had first won Hubert's heart.
Perhaps the cares of motherhood oppressed her,
or the children came too fast for her strength,
or the monotonous routine of domestic life
hardly suited her pleasure-loving nature ; but
as the years went on Kitty grew careworn
and peevish. Her very love for her husband

and children developed into fretful anxiety for
their well-beings. She toiled early and late in
their service, with no thought for her own
comfort, taking all her husband's kindly attentions
with a martyr-like meekness which at once
puzzled and distressed him.

Ever since his marriage Hubert had added
private tuition to his curate's work. He had
three or four pupils living with him  young
men who were backward, or in delicate health,
or who wanted the services of a private tutor.
Jem stepped into one of these vacancies, and
worked under Hubert until he went up to
Oxford. We were not utterly dependent on
Hubert, which made things easier for us ; for,
with a generosity for which we would not have
given him credit, Hubert only repaid himself
for our bare maintenance, and so made it possible
for Jem to realize his ambition of going to
Oxford. The Rector of Brookfield was in bad
health, and compelled to live abroad for a year
or two, so Hubert was practically curate-charge,
and his parochial duties, combined with
his pupils, kept him fully employed.

I was very happy at Fircroft when Jem was
with me, for he was always ready to listen to
my grievances, and sympathize with my disappointments
; but his first term at Oxford was a
severe ordeal for me. The pupils did not

interest me. Kitty was too much engrossed
with her domestic duties, and too over-weighted
altogether to be a companion to a girl of nineteen
; and if it had not been for the ladies at the
Hall -and especially Aunt Catherine, as Jem
and 1 called her  I should have had rather a
dull life ; and yet I tried to do my duty to Kitty
and the children, and kept all my discontent to
myself.

Why is it, I wonder, that we are so dependent
on our environment ? that we are so
clogged by circumstance ? that we are unable to
rise above the low level of every-day life ?
Why did Hubert's commonplaces and dry
matter-of-fact reduce me to indignant silence,
while Jem's mockery and masculine disdain of
sentiment only stimulated and amused me ?
Why did Kitty plaintive goodness try me
more than downright selfishness would have
done? Why was I so critical of my belongings,
so observant of their short-comings ? Why,
indeed !

One day I read a passage in a book of Aunt
Catherine's that struck me greatly. It was
written by a man who had let all his opportunities
slip, and whose life was a failure. And
yet this Amiel was a kindly, gifted creature, with
noble impulses and a warm heart, and a lofty
intellect ; but intense timidity and distrust, and

an unwholesome habit of introspection and
subtle self-criticism spoiled his life-work. ' The
man who insists upon seeing with perfect clearness
before he decides, never decides,' as he
himself truly says ; ' accept life, and you accept
regret

But the passage that touched me most was
this : ' Recognise your place ; let the living
live ; and you, gather together your thoughts ;
leave behind you a legacy of feelings and ideas.
You will be most useful so. Renounce yourself;
accept the cup given you, with its honey
and its gall, as it comes.'

Gather together your thoughts ; leave behind
you a legacy of feelings and ideas. You
will be most useful so.' I cannot tell why the
words haunted me. Could a girl's thoughts and
feelings benefit any human being } Is there
anything in my small experience that could
interest or encourage a fellow-creature ? That
is what I want to knows ; that Is why I am ransacking
the past in the hope of finding a stray
pearl or two of wisdom. The child Olga
scorched her finger in the presumptuous search
for martyrdom. Perhaps, after all, the girl
Olga was no wiser.

I was sitting in the garden one afternoon
overlooking the children at their play. Kitty

was mending, as usual, in the great empty
dining-room ; her head ached, and her voice
had been more plaintive than usual, as she
reluctantly yielded to my request for work.

There is no need for you to slave, too, Olga
she said, with a certain thinness and acerbity of
tone that she always used when she was cross,
poor little soul ! * Of course it is my duty ; but,
as Jem said yesterday, you were not to be made
a drudge.'

So that speech had rankled. It was only
one of Jem's foolish blunders. Jem had been
put out because I stayed to help Kitty in the
nursery, instead of going down to the Hall
garden with him to hear the nightingales. It
was just a fit of boyish impatience that meant
nothing. But Kitty had fretted over it in
tearful fashion all the evening, and here it was
turning up again, as such ill-favoured weeds of
speech have a knack of doing.

Please let me have Wilfred's tunic to finish,'
I returned quickly, ' for I never care to be idle ;'
and I stretched out my hand for the work  for
it was no use arguing with Kitty when she was
in this mood  and carried it off in triumph.
But before I was half-way down the lawn my
conscience began to prick me : why could I not
have said something kind to cheer her for the
rest of the afternoon ? Kitty always looked

happier if Jem or I said a kind word to her.
And here again a speech of my favourite Amiel
seemed to prick me with fine needle-like sharpness,
for it was so true : ' Oh 1 let us not wait to
be just, or pitiful, or demonstrative towards
those we love until they or we are struck down
by illness or threatened with death ! Life is
short, and we have never too much time for
gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling
the dark journey with us. Oh, be swift to
love ; make haste to be kind !' With a sudden
impulse I went back through the dining-room
window just as Hubert entered it by the door.

My dear, are you very busy ?' with a rueful
glance at his wife's overflowing work-basket.

1 am always busy, Hubert,' returned Kitty
rather severely; 'but of course if you want
me '

'It is only those letters ; they must be
answered before post-time, and I have to go
down to the schools ; but you seem rather overwhelmed,
so perhaps Olga might help me,'
looking at me rather beseechingly.

No, no,' replied Kitty hastily ; ' give them
to me, Hubert. It was only last night that Jem
complained that we had turned Olga into a
perfect drudge, and that she never had time for
anything. I would rather slave night and day
than hear Jem say that again.'

My dear, what can you mean ?' and Hubert
looked at us both in solemn disapproval.
Kitty's sharp little speeches always took him by
surprise ; he had a habit of laboriously picking
them to pieces to find out their meaning, which
was just going on the wrong tack with Kitty,
for when people say more than they mean, it is
never well to take them literally ; but Hubert
was literal and exact by nature.

Kitty is talking nonsense,' I interposed.
Jem meant nothing by his speech ; he does
not really think I am put upon, for he knows i
like to be useful. If you want me to write your
letters, Hubert, you must say so quickly, as the
children are waiting for me in the garden.'

I always write Hubert's letters,' replied
Kitty with dignity, for she was not above
jealousy, and on certain occasions would stand
on her wifely rights. * Put them down beside
me, Hubert, and they shall be ready by post-time.
And you may say what you like, Olga,
for )0u always take Jem's part, but he really
meant what he said  that we take advantage
of you. It is not the first time Jem has made
these speeches.'

Well, well, have your own way, Kitty,' I
said wearily, for I found the discussion fatiguing.
I left Hubert to hear the remainder, and to
groan in spirit over Jem's selfishness. Somehow

my afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled  human
misunderstanding had thrown a shadow over the
sunshine. But I was rather taken aback when
I heard Hubert's footsteps following me.

You are too quick, Olga,' he said reproachfully.
' I wanted to ask you a question. Is it
Kitty's fancy, or does Jem really think we put
upon you ?'

You had better ask him,' I returned scornfully.
And then I relented at the sight of his
evident perplexity. ' Oh no, Hubert ; Jem
never meant it at all. He was only cross for
the moment because I could not attend to him.
Why will Kitty make a fuss over every little
word ?'

She is very sensitive. Jem knows that,
and ought to be more careful.'

You cannot expect a young man always to
measure his words, Hubert. Jem is far too
kind-hearted to give pain consciously. Kitty
is too exacting.'

You must not find fault with her to her
husband, Olga;' and I knew by Hubert's voice
that he was much displeased. ' Kitty has far
too much to do, and she is not as strong as she
ought to be. I think you and Jem might
make allowances for slight irritability, if not for
Kitty's, at least for my sake.'

I liked Hubert all the better for standing up

for his wife. If I had a husband I would not
allow anyone to find fault with him, I am quite
sure of that. But, all the same, 1 was bound
to defend Jem, and it seemed to me as though
Hubert was attacking me personally.

I am always ready to help Kitty,' I returned
in an injured tone ; ' neither you nor
she has any cause to complain of my conduct.
It is not quite fair to speak to me in that way.'

Hubert looked a little taken aback by this ;
he was a quiet, even-tempered man, and was
for peace at any price.

Well, well, don't put yourself out, Olga.
Of course, Kitty and I know we have no right
to turn you into a household drudge, and, of
course, we are very grateful for your assistance.
You have always acted kindly by us, but as
Kitty felt herself aggrieved by Jem's unlucky
speech, I thought I must put matters right. 1
am not the least offended with you.'

I would much rather you were offended
with me than with Jem.'

How you do spoil that boy !' And here
Hubert looked at me reproachfully. ' Nothing
Jem says or does is wrong.'

Nonsense, Hubert !' But all the same he
was right. I never could blame the dear
fellow. I was a little touched when Hubert
looked at me in that melancholy fashion, and

Stroked his coat-sleeve penitently. I believe
he had a fatherly fondness for us both.
Could it be possible that he was just a trite
jealous of Jem ?  that he thought his only
sister should be more to him  was that the
reason of his sad look ? ' Don't talk any more,
Hubert,' I said, dismissing him with a smile ;
I want to finish Wilfred's tunic. Go back to
Kitty, and cheer her up a little.'

No ; I must go to the schools.'

But he took my hint, and walked off. I
watched him across the lawn. Many people
admired Hubert ; Kitty did with all her heart.
He was a fair, gentlemanly-looking man, and
his beard and spectacles were imposing. He
was slightly bald, too, which gave him a patriarchal
appearance ; but to me his face was like
his sermons  heavy, sensible, and wanting inanimation.
Hubert had one very tiresome fault
he could not understand a joke. Jem and I
puzzled him dreadfully at times. He would look
at us and shake his head, and then go on with
some learned disquisition intended for our edification.
1 am afraid the pupils took advantage
of this want of humour, Mr. Vivian especially.

The children were playing under the big
mulberry tree, Hugh in charge of the twins as
usual, and Girlie-ga  as baby called herself 
toddling over the grass, hand in hand with

VOL. I. 2

Wilfred. She screamed with delight and
dropped Wilfred's hand at the sight of me.
Her big white sun-bonnet had tumbled off, and
the rough yellowish curls shone like gold in the
sunlight, as she stumped up to me on her little
fat legs, and emptied her pinafore into my lap
with the lavish generosity of infancy flinging
its all with both hands. ' Oo's dot 'em now,'
she said, looking lovingly at the cropped daisies
and languishing buttercups. How easy to
forget one's grievances in the sunshine! As I sat
with the children playing round me, I felt that
it was a lovely world after all.

The white butterflies were skimming over
the flower-beds, and the great brown bees
were humming secrets among the hives.
Hugh's fantail pigeons were strutting about the
roof, and the deep cawing of rooks sounded
from the Hall grounds. Some thrushes were
singing in the shrubbery, and a pair of linnets
were twittering in their nest above us. The
freshness and sweetness of early summer were
over everything. They would soon be making
hay in the Hall meadows. Fircroft was a
rambling old house without any pretension to
beauty, but the garden was delightful. A tennis-lawn
lay before the drawing-room windows,
closed round by shrubberies. This led to the
Surprise, as the children called a small inner



lawn, with a mulberry-tree and a medlar, and
surrounded by beds of old-fashioned flowers
which bloomed in their season : bushes of spiky
lavender and tall gleaming lilies, and lady's lilies
and St. John's, spicy carnations and humbler
pinks, lupins and hollyhocks, and quaint old
monk's-hood ; even the much-despised London-pride
and sweet-william kept company with
sweet peas and nasturtiums  a veritable wilderness
of sweets, very different to the stiff beds
of geraniums and verbena which were Hubert's
special pride. The Surprise was the children's
play-ground ; here on summer afternoons the
twins sat in the low branches of the medlar-tree
with their favourite dolls, and the black
and white kitten, Smut, while Hugh and Wilfred
worked in their gardens, and I sat reading or
working with dear old Rollo at my feet.

Rollo was my dog. Mr. Vivian had given
him to me when he was only a puppy ; he was
a splendid black retriever with a beautiful head,
and was my constant friend and companion.
When Jem went to Oxford, Rollo quite seemed
to understand that I was in need of sympathy. I
have seen him look at me  well, not with actual
tears in his eyes, though I do believe dogs cry
sometimes, but with such a pathetic expression
in them, as though he were sorry for me, and
wanted to comfort me in his doggish fashion.

THE LADIES AT THE HALL.

'What deep interest there would be in the most commonplace
society if we could associate with human beings in this
wondering, inquiring way, exactly as the chemist interrogates
every new subject by innumerable tests, until he has discovered
its properties and affinities' Rev. Frederick Robertson.

An hour afterwards a light, springy step sounded
on the gravel path behind me, and a rough
tweed coat-sleeve was Interposed between me
and my work.

No, Jem, I am not a bit startled !' I returned,
coolly keeping the big brown hand
prisoner; and then I drew him down beside me
with a welcoming smile.

I am afraid It would not be right to call Jem
handsome. He was very big, and strong, and
brown ; but he had not a fine profile like
Hubert, and his features were blunt and
irregular. But I liked his honest eyes, and his

bright smile, and the merry laugh that always
seemed to lighten one's heart, and I think I
was even more proud than Jem himself of the
dear little budding moustache that looked so
fine and silky. ' As though it matters whether
a man is handsome or not,' as I would say to
Kitty, when she vaunted of Hubert's good
looks, and wondered why Jem was so different
to his brother. In my heart I admired Jem
excessively, and thought I had never seen a
liner young fellow. I liked his strength and
his skill in athletic sports. He was a fine
cricketer and a good oarsman, and he could
swim, and shoot, and ride, so it was no wonder
that he did not work quite as hard as other
men ; besides which, he was so popular at
Oxford that one need not be surprised if he
were just a little bit spoilt.

What have you been doing all the afternoon,
Jem ?'

Oh, Vivian and Campbell and I started for
Drayton, but there was something wrong with
my bicycle, so I had to come back  and a precious
long walk I had ; and just by the Hall I
met Aunt Catherine, and she asked if you would
come up to tea, and so I said I would bring
you : but it seems that would not do  Mrs.
Lyndhurst is not so well as usual, and poor
Aunt Catherine looked a bit worried.'

Do you really think she wants me,
Jem ?'

I suppose so,' flinging up his straw hat and
catching it again, for Jem could not be still a
moment. ' She said, " Olga has not been here
for a week, and I am sure Virginia misses her ;"
the meaning of that is pretty evident.'

Yes,' hesitating a little ; ' but I don't want
to tell Aunt Catherine why I kept away. I
think Kitty is a little hurt that they never ask
her now  she says it is such a slight, and she
complained to Hubert about it : but how can I
help it if they like me best.''

Kitty is a humbug,' returned Jem, in a disgusted
tone; * as though she, and Hubert too,
do not know what you and Aunt Catherine are
to each other !'

Yes, indeed. I have always loved her so,'
with tears in my voice. * I can never forget
how kind she was to us both when we first
came to Fircroft : she made our life ever so
much happier.'

Of course, she is a trump ; I always told you
so. I wish she were our real aunt  don't you,
Olga ? I should not mind being her favourite
nephew.'

You mercenary boy ! but there is Mrs.
Lyndhurst to consider  the Hall really belongs
to her. Aunt Catherine is not such a rich

woman, after all ; at least, her sister seems to
have the lion's share.'

Indeed, you are wrong ; they are co-heiresses.
But I believe the old squire left in
his will, that if either of his daughters had a
son, the Hall was to go to him when he came
of age. I don't know how they will arrange
matters now ; perhaps there may be a chance
for me, after all. I shall not a bit mind taking
the name of Seton that is only a detail ; and
then you can come and live with me, and lord
it over Kitty.'

No ; nonsense, Jem ! how you talk ! but I
can't stop to listen to you. I shall go across in
my garden-hat, and you shall tell Kitty that
Aunt Catherine sent me a message ; if I go
back to the house there will be another discussion
and more grumbling. Oh, Jem, if I were
only as free as air !' stretching my arms over
my head, and drinking in a deep draught of the
sweet summer air.

Jem looked at me with full understanding
and sympathy, and then whistled to Rollo.
Nurse had just come in search of the children,
so I folded up my work and gave it to her, and
then we sauntered down the kitchen-garden,
between apple and cherry trees, until we reached
a door in the wall. This opened into a green
paddock, where our one cow. Ruddy, was

feeding. She was a pretty creature, with a soft,
tawny coat and great wondering eyes, full of
unconscious wisdom, that reminded me of Aunt
Catherine's. Ruddy was quite a pet ; she followed
us all down the paddock in spite of Rollo,
and when I turned to stroke her she thrust her
cold, wet nose into my hand, and rubbed her
horns gently against me.

If you are late I shall come and fetch you,'
were Jem's parting words, as he let me through
the gate ; and then he leant over it and watched
me until I turned the corner, and I could hear
him singing the Eton boating song at the top
of his voice, as I walked down the elm avenue
that led to the Hall.

Brookfield Hall was a gray old house, hardly
as pretentious as its name ; It had no special
beauty of architecture, but it had a staid, venerable
look, as though its gray roof had sheltered
generation after generation ; for even as far
back as the time of the blessed martyr Charles,
whose memory I secretly worshipped  many
a fair Seton dame had strolled down the elm
avenue and listened to the same cawing of
rooks, or had diverted herself with pulling
posies in the stiff old garden, where peaches
and nectarines still grew against the sunny
walls, and where many a generation of peacocks
had perched on the mossy sundial.

How Jem and I loved that garden!  though
I have heard people call it old-fashioned and
out of date, and marvel openly at Miss Seton's
preference for homely flowers. But to Aunt
Catherine it was full of historic interest. She
loved the smooth grassy terrace, planted with
elms, that lay on one side, where a certain
Gwendoline Seton used to meet her Puritan
lover. The story ran that the poor young man
was killed at Naseby by one of her brothers,
Hugh Seton. Anyhow, he never came again
to the terrace. And Gwendoline watched for
him evening after evening ; and the rooks
cawed, and the peacocks screamed from the
sundial, and the nightingales sang in the
shrubberies, and still she watched for him in the
summer moonlight, or when the winter snow
lay on the Hall garden, and if anyone crossed
her path she asked them the same question,
Have you seen Ralph Annersley, whom they
call Ralph the Iron Heart, for methinks he is
long in coming this evening ?' For you see
she was mad, this poor Gwendoline  crazy
with long waiting, and I could not have borne
to have listened so often to her story but for
the comfort of the end. For joy came to heron
her dying bed, when she was an old woman
with hair white as the winter snows ; for, as
they were praying beside her, she suddenly

looked at them, and there was a wonderful
light in her eyes, and she ceased her aimless
muttering, and said, in the clearest possible
voice, ' Yea, for is it not written, '' Heaviness
may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning "? For truly I shall meet my beloved
again  my Ralph of the Iron Heart  in the
world where none shall ever say farewell !'

Ah, well ! they are re-united now. But how
pitiful to think of that long life, filled with one
maddening thought, one long waiting for the
impossible, the whole of God's fair creation
walled up and stifled in one crushed brain ! If
one were to love like that  God forbid !  it
were better to taste death at once. But Gwendoline's
story had ever haunted me ; and,
though I loved the terrace on a fine summer's
morning or in the full glory of the afternoon,
twilight always banished me from the spot. I
could not have paced under those dark trees
alone without fancying I heard a soft footfall
behind me ; and though I have no abject belief
in ghosts, still, if a white figure were suddenly
to start up and wring its hands, I

Dreaming as usual, Olga ?'

Aunt Catherine,' in a confused voice, for
there was Miss Seton standing in my path,
and I could see the amused look in her eyes,
I was thinking of the Lady Gwendoline,' I

blurted out. ' What put her into my head, I
wonder ?' And then Miss Seton laughed as
she kissed me.

I think Mr. Leigh is right. You are an
inveterate dreamer, Olga. We shall have to
cure you  Jem and I. But how late you are,
my dear ; they are bringing tea, and Virginia
has been in the drawing-room for the last hour.
Look at these lovely roses. I have been
gathering them from my favourite tree. You
shall have one of them to enliven your sombre
gown. Never mind, it is a very pretty gown '
with an approving smile  ' though it is a
little too dark to suit you, Olga. But then,
you know, I like young people to be gay.'

Jem asked me the other day why you
always wore black, Aunt Catherine,' I observed
rather wickedly, as I took the spray of roses
from her hand.

Because a plain, middle-aged woman always
looks best in black,' was the imperturbable response.
'Now, Olga'  as I was inclined to
contradict this blunt statement  ' don't argue
on such an uninteresting subject. When I was
your age I remember fretting for a good hour
because I had overheard some ill-conditioned
visitor speak of me as the plain Miss Seton,
and I bemoaned myself bitterly because I was
not as handsome as Virginia. But, my dear,

age offers us delicate compensations. We outlive
our morbid griefs and youthful ambitions.
I should feel no special pang now if anyone
called me the plain Miss Seton. I have buried
all that,' finished Aunt Catherine quaintly, with
the smile that was her great charm, for she knew
that Jem and I admired her with all our hearts,
with that finest admiration that is born of love.

She has such a dear face,' as I said once to
Jem.

Yes, awfully jolly, don't you know,' was
Jem's answer.

But it was quite true that Aunt Catherine
had been no beauty in her youth  one understood
that in a moment ; but she had a pleasant,
thoughtful face, and eyes that were wonderfully
young and clear, and her brown hair was
just threaded here and there with gray. In
spite of her forty-five years. Aunt Catherine
was slow in growing old. Her youth lingered
strangely ; her figure was still almost girlish in
its willowy grace ; she had not forgotten how
to blush at times when she was pleased or
excited. There would be a vividness, a depth
in her gray eyes that took one by surprise.
Now and then there would be bursts of eloquence
 picturesque, unrestrained, disjointed 
as though something in her nature had been
repressed and must find vent.

This made Aunt Catherine so interesting :
she had no cut-and-dried formulas of actions ;
no middle-aged mannerisms  she was so unlike
other people. So few persons nowadays dare
to assert any special individuality ; they prefer
a polite, discreet, mummy-like swathing. Now
Aunt Catherine was a real, imperfect woman,
true to the core, simply because she was herself.

Mrs. Lyndhurst is not so well to-day, Jem
tells me,' I observed as I followed Miss Seton
into the big square hall, somewhat dimly lighted
by a large stained window, the handsome oak
furniture making it still darker. But I had an
odd sort of reverence for those carved cabinets ;
and what talks Aunt Catherine and I had had
on that oak-settle that stood before the great
fireplace, now full of fir-cones! In winter a
glorious fire was always burning, before which
Mrs. Lyndhurst's favourite pug, Nix, loved to
bask, curled up on the tiger-skin.

Aunt Catherine shook her head rather sadly
at my question.

 She is never well ; I think she grows more
restless every day. She has much to bear 
more than most of us ;' and then she threw
down her garden-hat and gloves, and, still
carrying her roses, led the way to the drawing-room.


Olga is here,' she observed in a very different

voice, Into which a Httle cheerfulness was
evidently forced. ' I hope we have not kept
you waiting for your tea, Virginia ?'

What does It matter, Catherine !' was the
indifferent reply, as Mrs. Lyndhurst put down
her knitting and held out her hand to me with
her usual gentle smile. ' How are you, my
dear ? I am glad to see you. You have not
been near us for a week, Olga  a whole week ;
but I suppose you find us dull company ?'

I laughingly disclaimed this speech, and sat
down by Mrs. Lyndhurst. I was very fond of
her, and very sorry for her ; but I did not love
her as I did our dear Aunt Catherine. Her
nature was a depressing one, especially to young
people  trouble had aggravated a naturally low
and morbid temperament  and in spite of her
gentleness and a sort of attractive softness that
was very winning to strangers, I often found
Mrs. Lyndhurst exceedingly trying. Diseased
sensibility, unhealthy views of life, and the
incessant brooding of self-consciousness are
singularly repellent to youth. i\t times I felt
a sense of Impatience, of critical disapproval.
Why had Mrs. Lyndhurst weakly succumbed
to her troubles ? Why had she suffered them
to overmaster and crush her, instead of over-living
them as other women did ? Why did
she burthen Aunt Catherine with this weary

charge  the responsibility which the strong-er
and more helpless nature always takes upon
itself? Aunt Catherine never spoke of her
sisters trouble  never mentioned her except
in a tone of divine pity, such as one might
use to a sick child. ' Virginia had so much
to bear ;' and yet the little Brookfield knew of
her story hardly accounted for a melancholy
that at times bordered on despair. Unhappy
marriages have never been rare in England.
Many a woman has found wedlock not the
state of bliss she imagined it, and has dragged
on a miserable and disappointed life ; and Mrs.
Lyndhurst's married life had been a brief one.

Hubert had told me the little I knew on the
subject ; but I had no idea how he had gained
his information.

The old squire had been a hard-natured man,
with an obstinate temper, and a most exaggerated
notion of his own importance and dignity.
His wife and daughters had been greatly in
awe of him, and even Mrs. Lyndhurst, who
had been his favourite, had not dared openly to
contest his will.

During a winter spent in Rome, a young
artist, Paul Lyndhurst by name, had been
much in their company, and a secret attachment
between him and Virginia had been the
result. The only one who was cognizant of

the State of affairs was Aunt Catherine, and
she pleaded vainly and with tears that her
sister should give him up.

'It is an infatuation,' she said over andover
again. ' He is not a good man. He is
terribly handsome. He has fascinated you
with his good looks and cleverness ; but I
distrust him, and father will never permit you
to marry a poor artist.'

I will never give him up.' had been Virginians
answer ; ' I love him so that I am ready to die
for him.' And, alas ! she made up her mind to
live for him. The very day before they left
Rome there was a secret marriage, and after a
terrible scene, during which JMr. Seton lashed
himself into a state of fury, and forbade his
daughter ever to enter his house again, Paul
Lyndhurst took his wife away, and for months
they did not hear a word of poor Virginia.
But one day  about two years after the unlucky
marriage, a few months after Mrs. Seton
had died of a lingering disease  Virginia
suddenly and unexpectedly made her appearance
at the Hall. Hubert could tell me no
particulars of that return, or by what means the
father's wrath was appeased. Her husband
was still living, but she had left him for ever.
She looked ill and altered ; indeed, her health
seemed permanently broken. Perhaps his wife's

death had softened the father's heart, for he
did not refuse to take his child back ; and during
the last year of his life Virginia was his favourite
companion.

This was all I knew, and Aunt Catherine
never spoke of the past. From the first she
had accepted the sacred charge of her sister's infirmities,
and had shaped her own life to meet
her sister's requirements.

I looked at Mrs. Lyndhurst as she rose to
lay aside her work. She always walked feebly
and slowly, as though she were tired to death ;
her graceful figure seemed to droop with
fatigue. There was something pathetic in her
appearance. She always wore a black gown that
was almost widow-like in its straight, severe
folds ; but there were no delicate white finishes
to the neck and cuffs. Instead of that relief she
generally wore a black lace scarf wound loosely
round her slim throat ; this gave a strange
contrast to her pale, sad face and silvery hair.
Her eyes were dark and soft, and would have
been beautiful except for their restful look.

Mrs. Lyndhurst always looks as though she
has lost something,' Kitty once said in her
shrewd way.

I was foolish enough to repeat this speech to
Aunt Catherine. I noticed that she coloured,
as though the remark did not please her.

VOL. I. 3

'She has lost her life's happiness,' she returned
gently. 'Mrs. Leigh is right; but there are
some losses that cannot be made up in this world
my poor Virginia's is one of these.

The drawing-room at the Hall was a charming
room, with three windows opening on
the Italian garden, as it was called  a straight
stone terrace, with antique vases, leading down
by steps to a long gravel walk bordered by gay
flower-beds : this led to the Lady's Walk. On
the other side was the old Elizabethan garden,
with the sunny south wall where the peaches
grew, and where the peacock plumed himself on
the sundial : this was Aunt Catherine's special
garden. Mrs. Lyndhurst, who had no love for
flowers, preferred the elm avenue and the
terrace where her unhappy ancestress had
walked. 1 thought Mrs. Lyndhurst looked
unusually ill this evening : her eyes were bright
and feverish. She seemed disposed to be talkative.
Aunt Catherine, on the contrary, was
somewhat silent.

You are looking very well, Olga.'
I am perfectly well, thank you  in a state of
rude health, as Jem expresses it.'
I hope Mrs. Leigh is well also ?'
Kitty is only so-so ; she is rather thin, and
does far too much, and then Hubert worries
himself about her. It is such a pity people

cannot be sensible, Mrs. Lyndhurst, but that
they will always attempt the proverbial last
straw  Kitty always does.'

She has an anxious mind, I suppose ;' but
evidently Mrs. Lyndhurst had not listened to
my little tirade ; she was following out some
thought of her own, for she spoke absently.

Olga she continued in a different tone, ' do
you think your sister-in-law could spare you?
We have such a nice plan in our heads, Catherine
and I. May I tell Olga about it, Catherine ?'

I thought Aunt Catherine seemed a little
startled at the question.

There is no hurry, is there, dear ?' she returned
gently. ' I never thought you meant to
speak to the child this evening.'

No hurry !' repeated Mrs. Lyndhurst irritably
; ' that is what you always say, Catherine 
next week, next month, a year hence, what does
it matter to you ?' with a singular inflection on
the last word ; ' and yet you told Dr. Bingham
yesterday that it was all arranged.'

And so it is arranged. Please do not excite
yourself, Virginia. Have I ever gone from my
word yet ? Olga,' turning to me with the
worried look I knew so well, that always told
me so plainly that Mrs. Lyndhurst had been unusually
exigeante, 'my sister wants me to tell you
about our plan. I have to go abroad next month

32

on business  a little family matter that has to be
settled,' and Aunt Catherine spoke somewhat
nervously. ' Virginia does not like me to go
alone, and St. Croix is a very pretty place.
You have always wanted to see something of
foreign life  do you think your mother and Mrs.
Leigh could spare you ? It shall be no expense
to you, 1 can promise you that, and I shall be
very glad of your companionship ;' and here
she paused and looked at me inquiringly, and
I suppose my face was sufficient answer. ' You
would like it, Olga ?'

To shake off Brookfield dust for once in
my life I Oh, if only Jem were here now !
To go to St. Croix  with you  you ! Oh,
I must kiss you, Aunt Catherine ! You are
such a dear, you know ! If only It is not too
good to be true I'

Mrs. Lyndhurst smiled benevolently over
my girlish rhapsodies ; but why did Aunt
Catherine look so grave  she who loved to
give young people pleasure ? She even drew
back, in a pained sort of way, when I kissed
her.

I am going on business, Olga ; you must
understand that.'

As though that matters to Olga,' interposed
Mrs. Lyndhurst anxiously; 'there is nothing
to prevent her amusing herself. Strange to say,

my dear,' addressing herself to me, ' we have
some English friends Having at St. Croix, and
they have agreed to let us have their house.
Mrs. Milner's father, a clergyman in Liverpool,
is ill  dying, they fear  and they wish to come
to England The house is ours for three
months if we like.'

But surely you are not going to St. Croix
for three months, Aunt Catherine !' I exclaimed.

I should think not. I have fixed no time ;
perhaps a week or two may settle my business.
I should not care to leave Virginia longer than
I could help. If I could only have persuaded
her to come, too !' and here Aunt Catherine
looked wistfully at her sister.

Mrs. Lyndhurst's pale face grew paler than
ever at this appeal.

What do you mean, Catherine ?' she said,
in an alarmed voice ; ' have we not talked overall
that  you and I ? Do you not know me
better than to propose it ? Do you think I have
strength for such a journey ?'

Dr. Langham has always recommended a
sea voyage. It is only twelve hours, Virginia.'

It would kill me  I tell you it would kill
me ! You are cruel, Catherine, to agitate mein
this way. Nothing will induce me to leave
the Hall. If you do not wish to go, say so.
I have no right to over burthen you. But the

child will be disappointed, and the Miners
too, for they thought everything was settled.'

And so it is settled, my dear Virginia.
What can you mean ? Have I not promised
you solemnly to settle this business as well
as I can ? Perhaps you could have made it
easier for me, if you could have overcome
your nervous dread of the journey ; but we
will not say any more about that. Olga, when
you go home, perhaps you will speak to your
brother and Mrs. Leigh about this. Or shall I
call and ask them myself'* You are not of
age yet, you know,' with a faint smile  why
was Aunt Catherine so unlike herself ?  ' and
then there is Jem to consider.'

Jem has a tutorship,' I replied quickly.
He leaves Fircrofc next week.'

And most likely I shall start the week after.
Well, settle it as you like, my dear ; but I will
undertake to talk over your brother, and if
Mrs. Leigh should be obdurate, you must send
for me.'

And then Aunt Catherine got up in a hurry,
and said she must put her roses in water ; but
I think she wanted to end the conversation, so
I took the hint, and observed that Jem would
be waiting for me. And then Aunt Catherine
said that if I would wait a few minutes she
would walk down the avenue with me.

AUNT CATHERINE

Like alone acts upon like. Therefore do not amend by
reasoning, but by example ; approach feeling by feeling ; do
not hope to excite love except by love. Be what you wish
others to become. Let yourself, and not your words, preach'
Amiel's Journal.

I THOUGHT Mrs. Lyndhurst looked uneasy at
this proposition, but she said nothing until Aunt
Catherine had carried away her flowers ; when
the door closed she beckoned me to her.

You are pleased with my little plan, Olga ?'
Is it your plan, Mrs. Lyndhurst ? Oh yes,
I am delighted ! I shall not be able to sleep tonight
; but are you sure Aunt Catherine wants
me to go ?'

I think, after all, it was she who proposed
it. We were talking over Mrs. Milner's letter
with Dr. Langham. Women cannot do without
a man to advise them, and Dr. Langham has
always been our confidant. He was laying

down the law to us after this usual fashion.
Catherine must not o alone  she would be
dull, and all that sort of think ; she must have
someone to make things cheerful for her. And
then Catherine said, "Very well, I will ask
Olga to oo. She has never been out of iMiiland,
and the chaise will do her good ;*' and Dr.
Langham gave a hearty assent, for you are a
great favourite of his, my dear. Indeed, if he

were only a little younger ' and then she

looked at mv. meaningly, and of course I laughed,
for this was an old joke a very old joke indeed.
Poor Mrs. Land hurst ! as though Jem and
1 did not know better than that. Why, lrook-
fKld was of a far different opinion ; it privately
held the notion that if the doctor had been a
bolder man he would willingly have aspired to
one of the ladies of the Hall, and that he was
not indifferent to Miss Seton's middle-aged
comeliness. Now I cannot vouch for the
truth of this ; it might only be village gossip
after all. Brookfield, like most villages, was a
scandalous little place, and made very free with
its neighbour's namci. Dr. Langham and Aunt
Catherine were the best of friends. I think
she had a sort of kindly feeling for him, and
compassionate him for his bachelor loneliness;
but as for any other thought, I am sure such a
notion would never have entered her head.

It was profanity to imagine it. Aunt Catherine
was the sort of woman one would never dare
to question on such subjects. Mrs. Lyndhurst
would have her feeble little jokes ; but I never
heard Aunt Catherine talk about love or lovers,
except in a very staid, sober way  only something
in her manner, in her very avoidance of
such topics, made me think she held very
solemn views on the subject. Any light talk
on such matters displeased her. ' We ought not
to joke on sacred things,' I heard her say once;
surely love  real love, I mean  is sacred.'

I was not ever likely to know if popular
gossip were correct in crediting Dr. Langham
with any special tenderness for Aunt Catherine ;
but he certainly respected and liked her more
than any other woman, and was always ready
to help her to the best of his powers. As for
Aunt Catherine, she looked on him as a trusted
friend, and always consulted him on all difficulties
; besides which, he was the guardian of
her sister's health and well-being, and I always
suspected that he was deep in their confidence.


People are afraid of growing old,' she once
said to me  ' they fear the loss of many of their
pleasures ; but I always maintain that every
age has its compensation. What can be better,
for example, than to watch new friendships grow

Stronger as we get older, to feel how they ripen
and mature with the years ? We no longer fear
that the friends of a lifetime will grow weary of
us and change ; we have proved them. Don't
you recollect, Olga, what your favourite Amiel
wrote ? " To know how to grow old is the
master-work of wisdom, and one of the most
difficult chapters in the great art of living."
And then again, and this well applies to the
same subject, that hackneyed subject of growing
old : " Do not despise your situation ; in it
you must act, suffer, and conquer. From ever)-
point on earth we are equally near to heaven
and to the Infinite." I wish we discontented
middle-aged people would take that to heart.'

How 1 loved the way Aunt Catherine talked !
It was generally when we two were together
that she would break out into one of these
eloquent little monologues. In mixed company
she was rarely talkative; the light coinage of
conventional intercourse never seemed to elicit
much response. With me she was often grave ;
she liked to give me her views on life, books,
duty, or any abstract subject. She called it
working off steam.' ' My mind is too closely
packed,' she said once. ' I have crammed it
with miscellaneous reading, and can only
assimilate a certain amount of intellectual
nourishment. The other day I was very

much struck by a remark Robertson made in
one of his letters. I have copied it out for you,
Olga. He says, " Multifarious reading weakens
the mind more than doing nothing, for it becomes
a necessity at last, like smoking, and is
an excuse to the mind to lie dormant ; whilst
thought is poured in, and runs through, a clear
stream, over unproductive gravel, on which not
even mosses grow. It is the idlest of all idleness,
and has more of impotency than any
other'"

Aunt Catherine was certainly not in one of
her talking moods when, after a brief delay, she
joined me in the avenue ; for though she took my
arm in her old way, she did not once break the
silence until the road was in sight, and then my
impatience was not to be repressed any longer.

Aunt Catherine,' I burst out in a tone of
mingled affection and vexation, ' I do wish you
would tell me what is troubling you ; you are
not a bit like yourself this evening. I am sure
that you are not going to St. Croix for your
pleasure or convenience ; someone is putting
some troublesome business on your shoulders,
and you are too kind to refuse to help. That
is always the way ; you never think of your
own comfort.'

I think I told you that I was not going to
St. Croix for pleasure, Olga.'

But can no one else do the business ?'
Only Virginia, and you can see for yourself
how the mere idea harasses her. She has never
slept out of the Hall for a single night these last
five-and-twenty years ; it is one of her unhealthy
fancies that any change would be bad for her.
I think I love my home as much as anyone,
but I like to go away sometimes, if only for the
pleasure of coming back. One has such a
luxurious feeling of home-sickness towards the
last, and that makes the welcome all the sweeter.
I do not think any sound is more melodious tome
than the cawing of our own rooks on the
first evening of my return, after I have been
away a week or two.'

How can you help loving such a beautiful
home ? I wish I could feel as much affection for
Fircroft. I am far too glad to leave it. Aunt
Catherine, are you sure that I shall be any
comfort to you ; that there is no one else whose
company you would prefer ?'

No ; you suit me exactly  how often have I
told you that, Olga I'

'It is very strange,' I returned musingly;
I often wonder how you can find pleasure in the
society of an insignificant girl  a clever womanlike
you!' and then Aunt Catherine did summon
up a smile.

 You are not insignificant, Olga ; the word

does not suit you in the least, you have far too
much individuality. Liking becomes a habit, I
believe, and I have grown to love you as my
own child. This sort of adoption is very sweet.
Single women are often lonely ; but I have
come to think that it is their own fault. With a
world full of human beings, there must be some
whom they can love and take into their
life !'

I know I owe all my happiness to you I
returned gratefully. We had retraced our steps,
and were still walking over the crisp, short turf
under the elms. ' I should have had such a
different life without you. Think what it would
be if the Hall and you and Mrs. Lyndhurst
were effaced from my existence ! How meagre
and unsatisfactory everything would be ! Only
Hubert and Kitty and the children ; just dull
prose  not a bit of poetry ! Oh, the treats you
have given us ! Jem and I count them up
sometimes. Do you recollect those weeks at
Hastings ?'

To be sure I do ; you and Jem behaved like
a couple of babies.'

We were children let out of school. Oh,
what fun we had ! And then last summer, when
you and I stayed at the Randolph, was not that
a glorious time ? If I live to a hundred I do
not think I shall ever forget the quadrangle at

Magdalen, with the moonlight silvering everything
; and that afternoon in Addison's Walk !
And do you recollect how we came back to
Jem's room to tea, and the dark young man,
whom they called the Atheist, dropped in, and
he was not an Atheist at all  not even an
Agnostic  though he had some queer ideas of
his own. All Jem's friends fell in love with
you, Aunt Catherine ; they could not help
themselves. I was just nobody  only Leigh's
sister ; that was what they called me  Leigh's
sister. It was Miss Seton round whom they
crowded, even the Atheist ; but as for poor
little me, I was just Leigh's sister  that was
all.'

This sort of talk was doing Aunt Catherine
good ; to certain fine natures nothing gives
greater pleasure than to be reminded that their
very existence creates joy for some lives. Aunt
Catherine was never satisfied with purely personal
enjoyment ; she was essentially a lady in
its old-fashioned, Saxon meaning  the Hlaf-
weardige, the bread-keeper  only she liked to
break her loaf with others, to be perpetually
dispensing largesse. I have often heard her
groan over the burden of her own wealth.
There is too much,' she would say piteously,
there is far too much for Virginia and me to
spend on our two selves. We have neither of us

any luxurious tastes  Virginia does not understand
art, neither do I. We have no kin  what
is the use of filing the Hall with beautiful
things just for us to enjoy, when we do not

know who is to succeed us. If ' but here

her face clouded, and a sort of wistful look
came into her eyes, but she did not finish her
sentence  ' If she had married and had children,'
is that what she would have said ?

Aunt Catherine had resumed her natural
manner now, she even volunteered to be more
explicit.

I know you think me unsatisfactory this
evening, Olga,' she observed by-and-by, when
we had reached the Hall for the second time ;
but the fact is I am very much worried.
Virginia, poor dear, is a little unpractical. She
and Dr. Langham insist on my having a companion
during my stay at St. Croix, and without
a moment's hesitation I fixed on you ; and now-virginia
is unwilling that you should be told
the object of our journey. Perhaps, in my heart,
I am as unwilling as she ; but how are you to be
any help or comfort to me if I may not repose
confidence in you ? You will go your way and I
shall go mine, and there will be no question of
pleasure for either of us ; when you see me
worried you will not venture to question me,
and as for me, my lips will be closed. " Why

need we tell anyone ?" that is all she says  you
know Virginia's way.'

I must confess I was somewhat hurt at this.
They were so much to me, these two dear
women, and 1 was so much to them ; and now
Mrs. Lyndhurst had judged me to be unworthy
of their confidence. I was only a girl, only
Olga ; it was safer to be silent !

Aunt Catherine looked in my face, and read
my thoughts.

No, you are not unworthy of our confidence,'
she said quickly ; ' if you are young you are
reliable. Virginia knows that as well as I do.
But there are difficulties, complications : it is a
troublesome sort of business  you must let me
think over it quietly. If I make up my mind
that it is necessary to tell you, Virginia will
have to yield, for I shall go only on my own
terms. I think, after all, the chief difficulty
consists in my own reluctance to tell a painful
story.'

Of course, after this there was nothing more
to be said, and I was ready to go to St. Croix
in passive ignorance if she wished it. Nothing
could really cloud the pleasure of our intercourse.
I was not particularly curious by nature,
or given to meddle in other folk's business,
whatever Jem might insinuate to the contrary ;
so I only begged Aunt Catherine not to disturb

herself. ' Whatever you decide will be right,' I
observed conclusively, when at last I bade her
good-bye.

I wanted Jem to be the first to hear my
wonderful piece of news, but to my disappointment
he was playing tennis with Hubert, and
Kitty was sitting in her long cane chair outside
the drawing-room window watching them.
She was wrapped in her favourite gray woollen
shawl, and looked very tired and bored. I
knew just as well as though I had heard him,
that Hubert had coaxed her to put away her
work and rest a little  he had made her believe
that he would enjoy his game all the more if she
were looking on, and it was not in her wifely
soul to refuse compliance with his request after
such a compliment.

Forty  love,' shouted Jem, for he always
beat Hubert, and then he waved to me with his
racquet, and Kitty looked up at me with a
dubious sort of smile.

You might have told me you were going to
the Hall,' were her first words as I sat down
beside her.

Mights ' and ' oughts ' made up a great part
of Kitty's conversation.

I was in the Surprise when Jem brought
me Aunt Catherine's message,' was my suave
answer, for I could afford to be good-natured

VOL. I. 4

this evening, * and it was too much trouble to
come up to the house. Jem told you where I
was gone ?'

Yes, Jem told me when I was tired of
wondering why you did not come in to tea.
Of course, you are your own mistress, Olga '
(I wish I were); ' but you might have thought
1 should like to send a message.' (A second
might,' now for an ' ought') ' I wish you were
more thoughtful in little things.'

I took no notice of this dignified rebuke,
which meant that Kitty would have liked an
invitation too.

It is such a warm evening,' I observed carelessly,
' how can you muffle yourself in that
shawl ?'

I am never warm now,' she replied, and
she actually shivered as she spoke. ' Hubert
wanted me to sit out here ; but I would much
rather go in  I have not half finished my
work ;' but here she caught Hubert's eye, or,
more truly, the gleam of his eyes through his
spectacles, and nodded and smiled at him in
her old sprightly way.

What a pretty creature she had been when
Hubert first brought her home ! Even now,
when anything pleased her and she looked
bright and animated, and the colour came to
her face, and her eyes got dark, and big, she

reminded me of the Kitty of old. I do not
believe Hubert noticed the change in her ; he
admired her as much as ever in his simple,
honest way. I have seen him gazing at her
through his spectacles in the most lover-like
manner ; and, to do her justice, she admired
him just as much in return.

I wish Hubert played as well as Jem,' she
said rather disconsolately, as another ' fifteen 
thirty ' reached our ears. ' Jem has been beating
him all the time, and yet Hubert is so fond
of the game.'

I don't believe Hubert minds being beaten.
He knows Jem is a crack player, as Harry
calls him. He should not play single against
Jem ; they are not evenly matched. Mr. Cunningham
is a better opponent for Hubert.'

I should like him to win one game,' returned
Kitty rather pathetically, as her eyes followed
the two players. ' I dare say you think me
foolish, but you will understand it yourself, one
day, how one likes one's husband to win.'

Even in a game,' rather sarcastically, for I
thought pathos a little out of place here.

To bring strong feelings into the trifling
amusements of life seemed to me as wise as
children playing at soldiers with real swords ;
we should be sure to cut and wound each
-other all day long. But, then, Kitty never

42

liked Jem to excel in anything. It was my
private opinion that she shut her eyes wilfully
to Hubert's slowness, and that she 'made
believe,' as children say, that he was the wisest
and cleverest of men.

I thought it better to change the subject,
for really Jem was playing splendidly. His lithe,
agile figure seemed literally to bound over the
grass ; he never seemed to miss a ball. Hubert
was blundering more than usual ; so I distracted
Kitty's attention by telling her of Aunt
Catherine's proposition.

She listened to me in silence.

You are a very fortunate girl, Olga,' she
said, when I had finished my recital ; ' people
always seem to take a fancy to you ;' and here
she paused and looked at me in a critical sort
of way.

I wonder why people take a fancy to you ?'
was evidently her unuttered thought.

 I am sure I don't know,' was my careless
answer ; but Kitty started and coloured as
though I had read her truly.

Of course, you are very nice, dear,' she went
on, with ready repentance. ' When 1 was a girl
people took a fancy to me too ; but that is so
long ago.'

You were so pretty that people could not
help falling in love with you.'

'Well, I suppose not,' was her candid answer;
for, with all her faults, Kitty was singularly devoid
of vanity. She liked Hubert to admire
her, but, with that exception, she cared little
for compliments. ' But many people think you
are nice-looking, too, Olga  that is, when you
take pains with yourself.'

Thank you, Kitty,' I returned gratefully, for
I knew that she had done her utmost for me in
that sentence. My glass had long ago told me
that I was no beauty, and Jem's brotherly frankness
had not left room for doubts.

Hubert is the only good-looking one of the
family,' he said once ; ' for a girl you are very
so-so ; your complexion is all right, but your
upper lip is too long, and your nose is just what
a nose ought not be, and your forehead is too
high. I like a forehead to be like Clyde s, low
and broad. Yes, your eyes are nice  but there,
what does it matter ? we are all as fond of you
as though you were a daughter of Venus,' and
after this speech I had no farther illusions on
the subject of my personal beauty.

Aunt Catherine is anxious to know if you
can spare me,' I went on, for Kitty seemed in
such a comfortable frame of mind. Unfortunately
this seemingly harmless remark grazed
her sensibilities too closely. I knew by the
way she pursed up her pretty little mouth 

Kitty had such a pretty mouth  that she was
thinking of Jem's unlucky speech.

Do you think I should allow my selfish considerations
to stand in your way, Riga ? I
wonder what Jem would say if I deprived you
of such a treat ; all the same,' relenting visibly,
 I shall miss you dreadfully, and so will the
poor children. I think you have spoilt us by
being so crowd to us.'

Could I believe my ears ?

Do you really mean that you will miss me,
Kitty ? that sounds almost too nice to be
true.'

Have I been such an unkind sister that you
do not believe in my affection ? I did not think
you would have misunderstood a few sharp
speeches,' and here there were actually tears in
her eyes. * I have always been fond of you,
Olga  always ; you have such nice ways with
the children, and you never seem to think anything
a trouble. Of course it is very dull for
you here  Hubert says so sometimes. You are
clever, and I am not a companion for you ; but
I want to do my best for you, and so does
Hubert, and he is goodness itself, although he
is not Jem.'

Now what could I do but kiss her and tell
her that she was a dear little soul, and that of
course I was as fond of her as possible ? and so

I was, though she never gave me any real
comfort. Very sensitive people always remind
me of a hedgehog : there is no going near
them without pricking one's self against their
bristles.

'What has become of Hugh ?' I exclaimed,
after we had gone through this little scene
of reconciliation. I always thought Kitty loved
scenes.

He is learning his imposition in the schoolroom.
He did his lessons very badly this afternoon,
and so Hubert kept him in.'

I sighed ; poor little Hugh was so often kept
in  he had inherited his father's slowness.
Hubert had been stupid as a child. I wonder
why the parents did not remember this ; kind
as they were to all their children, they were
disposed to be hard on Hugh. He was my
favourite. Wilfred was a dear little fellow, and
the twins, Jessie and Nlab, were bright, pretty
little girls, but none of them came up to Hugh
in my estimation. He was such an unselfish,
tender-hearted boy, so devoted to his parents
and to his brother and sisters. I have known
him go without things  his share of fruit or
sweets  that the twins might have more ;
perhaps he was not clever, but he was the most
perfect little gentleman  no one ever heard him
say a rough word ; all the pupils were fond of

him, because he was always ready to do them a
service ; in his childish way, for he was only
nine, Hugh had a passion for service.

Poor Hugh shed many tears over his own
stupidity. He could not learn as quickly as other
boys of his age, and I used to fancy that Hubert
was a little exacting ; his boy's lack of brains
seemed a reproach to himself. I used to speak
to Kitty sometimes on the subject, but I never
could get her to see with my eyes. In the first
place, she would have to blame Hubert, a piece
of presumption that never entered her head ;
and in the second place, she would have to take
her son's part against his father  an equally
impossible proceeding ; so she always silenced
me with the same speech : ' Hubert knows best ;
it is not for me to interfere with my husband.'
For Kitty always got the best of an argument:
when every means failed, she rolled herself
round in certain stereotyped feminine
aphorisms, much as the hedgehog afore-mentioned
transforms himself into a dust-coloured,
spiky ball ; and ' Hubert knows best ' clinched
the most obstinate discussion.

AN Evening AT FIRCROFT.

I do believe that there ought to be more interest in humanity,
and more power of throwing one's self into the mind of everyone,
so that no visit should appear dull'

Rev. Frederick Robertson.

Just at this moment Hubert threw up his
racket with a despairing groan, but Jem
promptly and figuratively patted him on the
back.

Cheer up, old man ; you will do better next
time. You did not play so badly last set.'

It is no use playing against this fellow
observed Hubert ruefully ; ' he has beaten me
hollow, as usual. Never mind, I will have my
revenge yet.'

'AH right,' returned Jem cheerfully, as he
threw himself down on the grass by my side,
looking quite cool and fresh in comparison with
Hubert's flushed face. ' Well, what have you

two young women been talking about all this
time ?'

I was just going to ask the same question,'
put in Hubert, who had taken possession of the
sole remaining chair.

Now we were both of us longing to tell the
same story. I  because it was my own peculiar
and legitimate piece of property  being both eye
and ear witness of the whole affair ; and Kitty 
because she always liked to monopolize Hubert's
attention  and to be the channel through which
he should receive all interesting communications.

o

Knowing this peculiarity of Kitty, and being
bent on being the spokeswoman on the present
occasion, I commenced at racing speed ; notwithstanding
which, Kitty's Interpolations
tripped me up every minute much as follows :

Oh, Hubert, I have such a delightful piece
of news to tell you ! Do listen, Jem, and don't
tear my new print gown with your clumsy
foot.'

Yes, indeed, I call it a piece of good fortune,
Hubert,' from Kitty.

Aunt Catherine is going to St. Croix on
business '

Most important business,' corrected Kitty.

And she has asked me to accompany her.'

And Olga will not have a farthing of
expense. Think of that, dear !'

'Some friends of theirs, the Milners, have let
their house to Aunt Catherine for three
months.'

But we could not spare Olga all that time,
could we ? and, indeed, Miss Seton would not
require her nearly so long,' from the irrepressible
Kitty.

But I frowned her down, and went on :

St. Croix is a lovely place, about two miles
from the town of St. Genette, and the house is
delightfully situated ; but Aunt Catherine would
not describe it to me. And there are several nice
English families, only Aunt Catherine says she
will have no time for visiting, and she has particularly
desired the Milners not to ask their
friends to call.'

I am afraid that will be a lite dull for
Olga ; she does so love society.'

Aunt Catherine purposes to start early next
month, and I am to get my things ready ; and
she hopes, Hubert '

Of course you can have no objection, dear ?
Olga is her own mistress, and it will be such a
nice change for her.'

Dear me, Kitty, I think you had better
finish yourself, for Hubert is staring at us both
as though he were utterly bewildered,' which
was the fact  he was looking at us blankly
through his spectacles ; his slow comprehension

had evidently not groped its way to a full
understanding.

I think if you were to talk one at a time '

he said helplessly.

And then Jem gave me such a look! He once
observed, rather profanely, in my hearing, that
he wondered Hubert had been ordained at the
usual age, as he must have been twice as long
as other men in making up his mind about the
Articles of the Christian Faith, ' though I will
say this for him,' finished the irreverent boy,
that when he had once settled what to believe,
he would stick to it for the rest of his life.'

Poor old duffer !' Jem's look said so plainly
that I burst out laughing, and Kitty looked a
little offended. I knew by the way she bridled
her neck and elevated her little white chin, that
no amount of pressure would induce her to say
another word on the subject ; so, as Jem afterwards
remarked, I had my innings, and could
put the whole matter plainly before Hubert.
He was very much pleased when he fully understood
it all, and expressed himself as being very
grateful to Aunt Catherine for her kindness
to me.

She is a good creature,' he observed feelingly,
* and I am very much obliged to her.'

She is a darling !' ejaculated Jem, under his
breath.

I think we ought to call at the Hall and
thank her, Kitty, Will you go with me tomorrow
afternoon, my dear, and then we can
inquire after Mrs. Lyndhurst ?'

I think you had better go alone, Hubert,'
returned Kitty, with a touch of her old plaintiveness.
' I am afraid I am out of favour at the
Hall, for they never ask me now. The only
one they want is Olga  they make that very
evident.'

Stuff  nonsense !' broke from Jem's lips.
He was never tolerant of Kitty's morbid fancies.
You are a pretty sort of clergyman's wife,
Kitty, to let your husband pay all his pastoral
visits alone. I thought a clergyman advocated
charity, and all that sort of thing, and here you
are harassing the curate-in-charge with doubts
about his parishioners. I will wager my best
hat that Miss Seton, and Mrs. Lyndhurst, too,
will be delighted to see you tomorrow. If I
were you, Hubert, I would make her go. What
is the good of being a husband if one can't
order one's wife about?'

Strange to say, Kitty did not take umbrage
at this plain speech, though Hubert looked
alarmed at Jem's audacity.

Of course I shall go if Hubert wishes it,'
was all she said ; and Hubert looked as
delighted as though she had paid him the

choicest compliment. It was such a pity
Hubert had so little tact. He did not in
the least understand how to manage Kitty.
In spite of her little tempers and tiresome
ways, she was a good little creature at the
bottom. Jem would have made her a much
better husband ; he would have tyrannized over
her in a good-natured way, and rooted out all
her fancies, and dominated her for her own
good, and there would have been an end of
all these weary discussions and misunderstandings.



The gong sounded as we reached this point
in our conversation, and we could hear the
young men racing down the passages on their
way to their rooms.

'We must go and change, Jem.' and Hubert
started up, and Kitty and I followed them more
leisurely.

But I had not forgotten poor little Hugh,
and I hurried up to the schoolroom to see how
he was getting on with his imposition. Contrary
to my expectations, I heard voices, and on
opening the door I was surprised to see Harry
Vivian sitting on the schoolroom table with
Hugh's slate in his hand, and Hugh standing
beside him with a radiant face.

Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Vivian ; I quite
understand it now.'

'All right, little 'un; now go and show it to
your governor.'

And then he caught sight of me, and jumped
up with a boyish blush on his face, as though
he had been discovered in some wrong-doing.

Have you been helping Hugh, Mr. Vivian ?
That is very good of you.'

Yes ; isn't he awfully kind, auntie ? He has
been here ever so long showing me how to do
my lesson.'

'Well, it was hard lines on him, poor little
chap, being mewed up on such a lovely evening.
Now, do as I tell you, Hugh : go and show your
imposition to Mr. Leigh, and then run out in
the garden.'

And Hugh, with a grateful look at his friend,
tucked his books under his arm, and ran downstairs
to his father's dressing-room.

I wish Mr. Leigh were not quite so strict
with the little fellow,' observed Mr. Vivian, as
soon as he found himself alone with me. ' I
beg your pardon if I am saying too much, but
I always think both he and Mrs. Leigh are
rather hard on the boy ; they don't give him
credit for his good intentions. He does his
work to the best of his ability, and we are
not all blessed with the same amount of
brains.'

I agree with you,' I assented warmly; ' thank

you SO much for helping the poor child. I am
quite as grateful to you as he is

Nonsense ; I liked doing it, don't you know.
I have not forgotten how a boy feels under these
circumstances. Must you go. Miss Leigh ?
What have you been doing all the afternoon 
taking a walk with Rollo ?'

I am going to leave Rollo in a week or two ;
will you be very good to him in my absence ?'
and I gave Mr. Vivian a hasty sketch of my
plans. His face fell at once.

'You are going away, Miss Leigh, and we do
not break up until the second of August  nearly
a whole month without you ; what will Rollo
and I do ?'

You will do excellently well,' was my unfeeling
reply. ' Rollo will miss me, of course  dear
old fellow  because he is myconstantcompanion;
but, now I come to think of it, why should I not
take him with me ? Miss Seton will not mind.
Yes, Rollo shall go too ; he shall take his first
sea-voyage, and see foreign life with his mistress.
Oh, how delightful !' and I clapped my hands in
pure girlish glee.

You care more about that dog than you do
for the whole of us put together,' returned Mr.
Vivian reproachfully. ' You are so different
to other girls ; one cannot make the least impression
on you.'

Au revoir, monsieur,' I replied lightly, making
him a profound curtsey, and the next
minute I was in the passage.

We all liked Harry' Vivian, he was such a
nice, gentlemanly boy  young man, I suppose I
ought to say, for he was twenty. He had been
in bad health for some years, and this had retarded
his education ; but since his recovery
had made up for lost time, and was now working
to some purpose. Hubert was in hope that he
would be ready for his matriculation in a few-months.
He and Jem were great friends ; they
had the same tastes and opinions. I liked him
immensely ; indeed, I preferred him to the other
two pupils. Mr. Campbell was handsome, but
he was decidedly stupid ; and Mr. Cunningham
was unpleasantly rich, and thought too much of
himself in consequence ; but Harry  I called
him Harry' to Jem  was always nice and good-natured
and ready to do kind things, and if
only he would not tr}- to make pretty speeches ;
but that was so like a boy, and I suppose he
could not help his nature  only it sometimes
gave me a good deal of trouble to keep him in
proper order. I could not help laughing, as I
dressed myself, at the remembrance of his long
face. ' Nearly a whole month without you !' Poor
bov ! I am the only sfirl about, so he thinks he
is obliged to fall in love with me. How Jem
VOL. I. 5

would chaff him if he knew ; but he is too nice
a boy, and I will keep his lite secret for him.
Why, Kitty had half a dozen lovers before she
was eighteen, and I am a whole year older, and,
with the exception of Harry Vivian, no one has
ever paid me a single compliment ; but ' when a
person has too long an under lip and a nose that
is everything a nose ought not to be,' recalling
Jem's severe criticism, ' that fact need excite no
special wonder ;' and in this philosophic frame
of mind I finished my toilet.

The dinner-hour at Fircroft was always the
most wearisome to me in the twenty-four.
Hubert's bland conversation, somewhat tinged
with pomposity, seemed to cast a dead-weight
over everything. His twofold character of pastor
and master invested him with added dignity ;
and with Kitty in her pretty evening dress at
the other end of the table, drinking in his words
of wisdom as though he were Solon and Solomon
combined, no wonder he seemed to expand
with mingled importance and benevolence.
I always sat between Hubert and Mr. Cunningham
 a position I hated. If Hubert's rounded
sentences were not to my taste, Mr. Cunningham's
remarks were even less so. I never
knew a young man so entirely satisfied with
himself. He ought to have married Miss
Kilmanseg with her golden leg, for every

word related directly or indirectly to what regenerate
souls term filthy lucre. Egotism eked
out with a stammer and an eye-glass had little
attraction for me.

Have you heard from home lately, ]mr.
Cunningham ?' 1 would remark, with an attempt
to be gracious.

Yes  my  my  father wrote. He  he 
has had a stroke of luck  made a pot of m-m-
money lately ;' and thereupon would follow
some stuttering account of speculations or investments
which I did not pretend to understand,
or anecdotes of 'my hunter, my dogs, my
people.'

I never knew anyone so fond of the possessive
pronoun. When Jem was at home things
were far better. He always sat opposite tome,
and when Hubert was unusually prosy we
would telegraph our amusement to each other,
or Jem would strike into the conversation ; he
was the only one who dared to contradict the
master of the house.

Come, come, we have had enough of these
Greek fellows,' he would say ; ' they were
precious ruffians, I can tell you. It is too bad
to talk shop and hinder our digestion. Did
you see Roberts, of merton, has distinguished
himself ? He was always a plucky one.'
actually the audacious boy would change the

conversation after this fashion. Or he and Harry
Vivian, who always followed his lead, would
begin a sparring match ; witticism would follow
witticism. It was droll to see how Hubert
looked through his spectacles trying to understand
them.

What do you two fellows mean ?' he would
ask helplessly. ' I wish you would talk sense,
Jem.'

Only clever people can talk nonsense,' Jem
retorted once. ' If you would only try your
hand at it for half an hour, Hubert, it would
do you a world of good.'

You have forgotten, then, the great Roman
warn in Of : " Nescio vox missa revert "  that
means, Olga,' with explanatory courtesy, ' that
a word once uttered is irrevocable.'

Jem shook his head sorrowfully.

You are crushing butterflies with a garden-roller.
Can't you find a lighter implement to
brush the powder off our gauzy wings ? Vivian
looks quite depressed ; he is choking with conscious
guilt. " Nescio vox missa revert." My
poor Harry ! what is to become of all thy
breezy jokes ?'

'Really, Jem,' and Hubert drew himself up
in an offended manner, ' there are limits to
everything  even to jesting ;' for his feelings
were hurt on perceiving his quotation had

failed to make its mark. But Jem contrived
to soothe him. The brothers were really
attached to each other ; but Jem could not
always forbear a joke at Hubert's expense. I
am afraid he and Harry delighted in getting a
rise ' out of him, as they called it ; and really, to
watch his puzzled expression over one of Jem's
ridiculous jokes, was enough to make one die
with laughing. No, the dinner-hour was never
dull when Jem was at Fircroft.

It was our habit  Jem's and mine, I mean 
to escape the tedium of the drawing-room circle
as often as we could, and retire to the garden,
where Harry would join us.

Hubert and Mr. Campbell generally played
chess  a game of which they were both passionately
fond ; but Hubert, who was a strict
disciplinarian even in trifles, had laid down
the law that music was a necessary part of
every evening's entertainment. Mr. Cunningham
played the flute atrociously, and Harry
had lately taken lessons on the violin ; so Kitty
or I were in requisition as accompanies to these
misguided young men. To add to our misery,
Mr. Campbell had recently discovered he had
a fine bass voice. The adjective ' fine ' was
dubious ; but, alas ! the voice was undeniable,
and the game of chess was often curtailed in

order that Mr. Campbell's sonorous notes might
be heard and admired.

Now, a musical evening made to order, and
with indifferent musicians, has always been my
abomination of abominations; and yet I protest,
by the shades of Beethoven and Handel, that
I am a devout lover of music ; but a cut-untried
routine of badly-executed pieces, wherein
the same faults recur every evening, was enough
to sicken anyone. Kitty was far more patient
under the ordeal.

That's right, Kitty, my dear; you and Cunningham
played that last piece very well. Bravo,
Cunningham ! that does you credit, really ;' and
Hubert, who had not the least ear for music,
and whose nervous system was proof against
any amount of diabolic squeaks and quavers,
though even Rollo protested against them in
his doggish way, would beam on the complacent
youth who had just distinguished himself.

I make a point of encouraging my pupils'
musical tastes,' I heard Hubert once say to an
anxious parent. * Nothing harmonizes young
men more, or better disposes them to domesticity.
My wife and sister are accomplished pianists '
(oh, Hubert, what a fib! though certainly Kitty
had a pretty touch), 'and our evenings are delightful.
We have the flute, the violin  quite
an orchestra.'

Who ever heard a flute in an orchestra, you
silly fellow ?

I was bent on making my escape this evening,
so I whispered to Jem as he opened the door
for us after dinner :

Get rid of Harry ; I want you all to myself;'
and he nodded in his quick way.

Jem always understood me in a moment. I
found him waiting for me in the hall a minute
later.

Don't go in the garden, Olga,' he said ;
Campbell and Vivian are smoking their cigarettes
out there. Let us take a turn in the Elm
Avenue instead; no one will find us there ;' and
of course I consented to his proposition.

We had so much to talk about that I am
sure we walked miles before we had half exhausted
the subject. Jem was full of my projected
journey to St. Croix  he always took an
interest in my smallest concerns  and he wanted
me to tell him everything Aunt Catherine had
said.

I was so full of my recital, and Jem was so
nice and sympathetic, that I took no notice of
where we were going ; but all of a sudden I
awoke to full consciousness. The elms, with
the slumbering rooks, were no longer over our
heads ; we were walking down a side-path in
the Italian garden, and just before us was the

Lady s Walk, looking more sombre and mysterious
than ever In the moonlight.

Jem,' I remonstrated, ' why have you brought
me here ? You know nothing on earth will
induce me to enter the Lady Gwendoline's
Walk.'

What nonsense, Olga ! Do you mean you
are afraid to go there with me ?' And Jem's
voice had a touch of scorn that nettled me in
spite of my nervousness.

I would rather not. Don't be tiresome ;
Everyone has his or her special fancy. I
cannot bear that ghostly terrace. I always
imagine Oh, Jem  Jem! what Is that?'

And I pinched his arm In my agitation, for,
as though my nervousness had found its actual
embodiment, a white figure glided from behind
the dark trees. Was It Lady Gwendoline
waiting for her Puritan lover, Ralph of the
Iron-Heart ? ' Oh, Jem !'

'Hush, Olga! don't be a fool.' Jem was
just a little rough with me because my paleness
alarmed him. ' What a goose you are ! don't
you see it Is Mrs. Lyndhurst ?'

Mrs. Lyndhurst ! I recovered in a moment.
Of course it was she, only she looked so strange
and unlike herself Her black gown was hidden
under a loose white burnous, and she had
drawn its hood over her gray hair, so that she

/3

really looked ghost-like in the moonlight. The
next minute 1 begged Jem in a whisper to come
away.

Do come, dear ! She will be so vexed if
she thinks she is watched. Aunt Catherine
has told me so. She often takes solitary walks,
and nothing annoys her more than for anyone
to follow and speak to her. You knows she is
odd in her ways. She is coming towards us
now ; what shall we do ?'

But Jem, with ready presence of mind, drew
me behind a great flowering shrub, that completely
hid us, though we could just see through
the branches.

How I wished we were safe in our own
Surprise ! It was so uncanny to be hiding
there in the moonlight. Mrs. Lyndhurst was
coming towards us with a soft, gliding motion
that conveyed no sound ; her pale face was paler
than ever, and there was a fixed look upon it,
as though some sad thought dominated her.
Just as she was opposite to us  opposite our
hiding-place, I mean  she suddenly stopped
and wrung her hands, as though with involuntary
pain.

Oh, my sin !' we heard her say  ' will it
never be condoned in this world ? Will there
never be an end of all this suspense and
misery ? Only God knows !'

And then she turned away, and we heard
such a heart-broken sigh.

Now we can go,' whispered Jem eagerly ;
quick, Olga, before she turns.' And, holding
my arm tightly, we ran Lightly down the
garden-paths and gained the avenue ; but we
neither of us spoke until the Hall was out of
sight.

Oh, Jem ! what does it mean ?'

That is not for us to inquire,' was the
unexpected response. ' Poor woman, I always
guessed that her life had an unhappy secret in
it. I never saw sorrow more legibly written on
any human countenance.'

I knew her husband was a bad man.'

Yes, we all know as much as that ; but, Olga,
we must forget what has just passed. We
must not even let our thoughts dwell on it.
Mrs. Lyndhurst imagined that she was alone 
you must remember that.'

But I can never forget her words, Jem.'

Perhaps not ; but I do not mean to think
about them. If I can, I will wipe them out of
my memory. They shall be to me as though
they had not been spoken.'

I knew Jem had a keen sense of honour,
but I never felt before how much he was above
me in that respect. I am afraid women are
often faulty in this respect. I do not mean by

this that they would Hasten at doors, or voluntarily
intrude into other folk's conversation,
but they are often wanting in the finer points
of honour. I do not fancy a man, for example,
would criticise his visitor as soon as the outer
door closed on him, and yet I heard ladies
discuss their friends in the most heartless way,
and indulge in innuendoes at their expense.

Poor dear woman ! Yes, we will forget all
about it, Olga,' repeated Jem decisively, as
we reached Fircroft.

But though I tried hard to follow this advice,
I found it impossible. All that night, waking
or dreaming, the words seemed to haunt me :
Oh, my sin ! will it never be condoned in this
world ? Will there never be an end of this
suspense and misery ?' and ' only God knows !'
seemed to echo and re-echo through my brain.

SHALL YOU LET ME GO, MOTHER ?'

In no relation does woman exercise so deep an influence,
both immediately and prospectively, as in that of mother.'

Carter.

Human nature is exceeding complex ; it is
many-sided and Proteus-like in its shifting
transformations. There is something mysterious,
almost baffling, in seeing anyone we
know intimately under an entirely new aspect
the sudden metamorphosis stares and alarms
our inner consciousness in much the same way
that a flash of lightning dazzles our outward
vision. The arrowy brightness of electricity
illuminates the darkness, bringing sombre depths
and unknown objects into strange significance ;
but before we can grasp the meaning of the
spectacle the weird effect is swallowed up in the
blackness of vacancy.

In the same way human nature suddenly

reveals itself; in a moment some unseen force
or agency, some combination of circumstance
at once grotesque and terrible, asserts its power ;
with a shock, an upheaval as of an earthquake,
our foregone conclusions tumble about our ears,
our preconceived opinions are thwarted 
strangled. Nothing is the same, there is confusion,
chaos, the old order changes ; then the
turmoil subsides  there is quiet, a cessation of
strife ; but to us the calmness is ominous  what
has been may be again !

It was in this way that I thought of Mrs.
Lyndhurst the next morning on waking ; my
girlish faith had sustained a shock. Jem
would have scoffed at the idea of a few wild
words altering my estimation of a person, but I
could not take them lightly ; to me they where
pregnant with mysterious meaning  they hinted
at something chaotic, terrible. If only I could
have talked it over comfortably with Jem ; if
he could have reasoned my doubts away  but
no, there was his sense of honour warning me
off forbidden ground. On certain points Jem
was inexorable. I knew him too well ever to
hope that his reserve would yield to curiosity ;
it was no affair of his or mine ; we had been
innocent eavesdroppers, that was all. Jem
would have cried shame on me for letting my
truant imaginations play about a neighbour's

secret. ' Have you no sense of honour ?' he
would have said, with crushing sternness, if I
had weakly applied to him for a solution.
There was no comfort to be got out of Jem on
these sort of emergencies. If only I could follow
his creditable example, and wipe out the
memory of those words ; but to me it was impossible.
All the world knew that Mrs. Lynd-
hurst was an unsatisfied, unhappy woman, but
that she had sinned  no, impossible. It was
that word  sin ' that haunted me, and the despairing
tone in which it had been uttered.

I felt I could not go up to the Hall ; my looks
would have betrayed my inward uneasiness. I
was a bad actor ; Jem always told me so. I
should have felt like a culprit before Mrs.
Lyndhurst, and should have stammered over
the simplest sentence ; and in spite of her
gentleness Mrs. Lyndhurst was very clear-eyed
and observant. She was by no means indifferent
to people's good opinion ; she liked to stand well
with her friends ; any want of respect or consideration
would have hurt her grievously.

I suppose I had better not go to the Hall
this afternoon,' I said rather tentatively to Jem,
when I encountered him in the garden ; but
Jem refused to see the feeble bait I flung out
to him.

I suppose not, as Hubert and Kitty are

going,' he replied drily ; ' there is no need for
the whole family to show up, is there ?' and he
went off without another word, the tiresome
boy. Of course, he saw from my face that I
was dying to talk to him, but I might as well
have attracted a whale with a gaudy fly ! such
is masculine human nature and the manners of
brothers, that I believe Jem thoroughly enjoyed
disappointing me.

But my morbid curiosity was not to be repressed,
and on Kitty's return I followed her
upstairs on some pretence or other. Kitty was
not averse to my company, and she chatted
comfortably about her visit, as she smoothed
out the fingers of her gloves, so skilfully that
they looked like new. It was a sort of education
to watch Kitty at her toilet ; she had
wonderfully methodical little ways. She had
lost her parents when she was a child, and had
been brought up by her grandmother ; all
Kitty's prim habits had been inculcated by her
aged relative. Kitty's room, her drawers, were
models of tidiness ; she often volunteered to
turn out my drawers and boxes, and reduce
their chaotic contents to the same state of
elaborate neatness  her lectures to me on this
point were highly edifying and amusing.

'Well, it is a shame for girls to be untidy,'
Jem once said when I retailed part of Kitty s

lecture, giving it a humorous meaning. ' Kitty
is quite right, and you ought to turn over a new
leaf. A pretty sort of wife you will make, Olga !
I quite pity the poor fellow who ever aspires to
be my brother-inlaw which was rude of Jem,
and a cowardly going over to the enemy.

Did you see the ladies, Kitty ?' for, in common
with the whole of the village, we always called
them ' the ladies.'

'Yes; and Miss Seton insisted on our remaining
to tea. They were nicer than usual, very
kind and friendly, only Mrs. Lyndhurst looked
dreadfully ill. I never saw her face so pinched
and white. Hubert noticed it ; he spoke to me
directly we left the Hall. '' How wretched
Mrs. Lyndhurst looks !" that was what he said.'

'You and Hubert generally think alike, do
you not ?' But there was no sarcastic meaning
in my question.

Kitty took it seriously, as usual.

When I first married I thought husbands
and wives were bound to think alike,' she said
quietly, as she tried to smooth her dark, curly
hair. Kitty's hair would ripple into soft little
curls and waves above her forehead, though she
vainly tried to repress them ; but she might as
well have tried to straighten Girlie-gar's curly
crop. ' I was so young, you know, Olga, and
so dreadfully inexperienced. Why, I was only

twenty when dear little Cecil died,' for Kitty
had lost her first baby, and it had been a great
sorrow to her. ' I remember how hard I tried
to agree with everything Hubert said; but it
was no use, one must have one's own opinions,
so I gave it up.'

I am glad you were so sensible.'

I did not become so for a long time,' with a
faint sigh ; 'girls are dreadfully silly. Hubert
cured me at last, but I am not going to tell you
how; you will find it out for yourself some day,
when you are married. I think I like disagreeing
with Hubert now and then, because
he takes so much trouble to bring me round to
his opinion, and there is the pleasure of giving
in at the end.'

And it would be too matter-of-fact to think
alike on every point ?'

Of course '  with a knowing nod  * too
humdrum altogether ; I am afraid '  penitently
' I often give Hubert a great deal of trouble
with my little tempers ; but he is so dear and
patient that it makes me love him all the
better.'

1 pondered over this wifely speech, which
Kitty made with a good deal of feeling ; then I
shook my head.

If I had a husband,' I remarked, ' I should
wish to be perfect in his eyes. I should not

VOL. I. 6

allow him to see my faults more than I could
help.'

That sounds rather fatiguing, Olga, as
though one were to be in permanent full-dress.
One could not keep that up, you know ; there
would be a break-down soon.'

Do you think so ?' doubtfully.

I am sure of it. Why, my dear, two people
cannot live together without a good deal of
friction, without rubbing against each other's
angles. Men are so dreadfully tiresome, you
see; they are obtuse, and do not notice little
things, and that aggravates a woman. They
want you to think them perfect ; and if you
point out a defect, well, they are as hurt as
possible, and yet they will lecture you for half
an hour at a time, and tell you not to do this
and how to do that ; and they expect you to
listen with a smile on your face, and if you turn
the least bit cross they are off in a moment,
and think you unreasonable and ill-tempered.'

I am sure Hubert is not one of those
men.'

How do you know ?' turning on me quite
sharply; 'he has his little faults like other people;
he can be dense, too, and misunderstand one.
Not that I have not often given him a bit to
bear,' with another sigh, ' and of course it was
oftener my fault than his. I know that as well

as you do, Olga ; for I quite understand what
your hint impHes, and what you and Jem think
that I have never been good enough for
Hubert;

Oh, good gracious ! I was in for it now ;
but fortunately Kitty only grazed the dangerous
points and went off at a tangent.

I dare say you are both of you right, and I
am an uncomfortable sort of person to live with ;
but I cannot help my nature, and Hubert seems
happy enough. Well, we won't talk about that
any more, though I do wish I were different, for
all your sakes.'

My dear Kitty, I don't believe Hubert
wants you to be different ; he is far too fond of
you.'

She broke into a little smile at this.

Hubert is my husband, so of course he is
good to me ; but, Olga,' looking at me wistfully,
I wish you and Jem understood me better.
You don't know,' her voice trembling, ' how
hard it is never to feel well, or as strong as
other people. It makes me fanciful. I remember
when I never ailed anything  when
life was just beautiful to me. I never thought
then that I should ever come to feel as I do
now.'

'Are you feeling worse than usual, Kitty ?' I
asked, somewhat troubled at this.

62

No ; I am neither better nor worse. It is
the same every day. Dr. Langham says it is
want of vitality. I suppose he is right. I try
not to trouble Hubert more than I can help. I
do not like him to know how tired and 
I am ; he has enough on his mind
without that.'

I ought to help you more,' I began, feeling
rather conscience-stricken ; but Kitty would not
allow me to go on.

You do help me, Olga, and I would not
willingly monopolize your time. This is your
season of pleasure,' looking at me kindly ; * I
have had my time. Yes, indeed, I have much
to be thankful for. Hubert is good to me, and
I have the children. Perhaps if I were stronger
I should enjoy my life more, but we are not
sent into the world for our own enjoyment,'
finished Kitty, with vivid recollection of last
Sunday's sermon.

We had wandered far away from Mrs. Lynd-
hurst, and I dare not return to the subject,
especially as Kitty seemed disposed to moralize ;
but all at once she changed the subject somewhat
abruptly.

We have settled about your trip, Olga. Miss
Seton wants you to get your things ready at
once. I suppose you will require a new dress ;
your summer tweed is rather shabby.'

I am not sure that I shall buy anything,'
rather dubiously. ' I have spent my quarter's
allowance already.'

What a pity !' Kitty had quite recovered
herself now. ' If only my things would fit you!
Hubert made me get that gray gown and
jacket, and I have not worn them more than
three times ; but you are too tall,' regarding me
ruefully, for Kitty was one of the most generous
of beings, and would have stripped herself of her
pretty things willingly. ' So it is no good thinking
about that ; you must just ask Hubert for a
cheque ; tell him from me, if you like, that you
must have a new tweed dress and jacket and a
hat to match. Miss Seton must not be disgraced
by your shabbiness. He is in his study
now. Why don't you go to him and get it over,
and then wee can buy the dress tomorrow ?'

This was sensible advice, and after a minute's
hesitation I resolved to follow it. Perhaps
Kitty saw the reluctance with which I made up
my mind, for she patted me on the shoulder
kindly and said :

You need not be afraid ; Hubert is sure to
give you what you want ; he is always generous.'

Perhaps it was my pride ; but I did so hate to
ask for money. So I marched into the study in
rather a shamefaced way. To add to my embarrassment,
Hubert was making up parish

accounts, and looked up with rather an annoyed
air at the interruption.

What do you want, my dear ? This is Friday
evening, and I am extremely busy  will not the
business keep until another time ?'

Oh yes, of course, Hubert, only Kitty
wanted me to come. It is about money ; but I
can wait very well until tomorrow.'

No, no ; perhaps you had better tell me
now,' he returned fussily; ' but Kitty might have
remembered ; it is rather inconsiderate to interrupt
me just now,' and then he leant back in his
chair and took off his spectacles and regarded
me in a reproachful way as I stammered out my
request. He was still shaking his head over
Kitty's want of consideration as he wrote out
the cheque and handed it to me. ' Another
time please do not choose Friday evening he
said with mild insistence.

I had gained my point ; but, in spite of his
rebuke, I lingered a moment to ask after Hugh,
who had been missing all the afternoon.

Do you know where he is, Hubert ?' I ventured.


Hubert's fussiness vanished, and he put on at
once his stern schoolmaster s air at the mention
of Hugh's name.

'He is in his own room. I sent him there a
couple of hours ago. He had to do his sums

over again. His work has been disgraceful this
week  absolutely disgraceful ! I am beginning
to think he needs competition. We seem at a
dead-lock at present. He must go to school.
Vivian thinks so too ; only Kitty is so against
it ; but it has come to this  that I cannot teach
him any longer.'

Hubert was walking about the room as he
spoke. In mentioning Hugh's name I was
touching on a very sore point. His boy's slow
perception was a bitter humiliation to him. His
parental pride suffered a martyrdom. I felt for
him ; but, all the same, he was too hard on
Hugh.

'Oh, Hubert,' I exclaimed, 'do try him a
little longer. You have no idea how hard he
really works ; only lessons are not so easy to
him as to other boys. I think it will break his
heart to send him to school.'

He is breaking mine with his stupidity !' returned
Hubert, so bitterly that I stood aghast to
hear him. Hubert rarely spoke strongly about
anything. ' I can do nothing with him. I
talked to him yesterday for nearly half an hour
about his bad preparation, and he promised todo
better; and this morning his lessons were
worse than ever, and his only excuse was, one
of his rabbits had died and put everything out
of his head.'

I half smiled. Hugh was very babyish for
his age, but I knew he was devoted to his pets ;
but Hubert's sternness did not relax.

He is my greatest trial. It is hard to be
punished in one's children. I thought I should
have been so proud of Hugh  he was such a
bright lite fellow once ; but he must go to
school  I have made up my mind on that point.
Where is Kitty ? I want to talk to her. These

accounts must keep ' and Hubert stalked

off, grim and melancholy, to find his wife. How
I wished I had not mentioned Hugh ! Now he
would make Kitty miserable for the rest of the
evenings.

I hesitated for a long time before I ventured
to go in search of the culprit. When Hubert
was in one of these moods it was dangerous to
go against him ; even Kitty did not dare to
oppose him. Slow-natured men like Hubert let
their wrath smoulder unperceived for a longtime
; but when they are once at white heat,
they are not easily mollified. His very love
added fuel to his anger. Hugh's punishment
was likely to be commensurate with his father's
disappointment. After a time I took courage
and crept up to Hugh's room. I could hear the
click of spoons and cups in the schoolroom as I
passed  the children were having tea. I wondered
if nurse had remembered Hugh. The

room felt hot and close as I entered it, and
Hugh was stooping over his books in the hottest
corner. He looked up at me piteously as I
entered, and then put down his head on the
table and sobbed.

Oh, Aunt Olga, I cannot do my sums! My
head is so hot, and all the figures dance about
so. I have been trying for hours, and they will

not come right, and father says Oh dear !

oh dear ! what shall I do ?' and the poor little
fellow cried as though his heart would break.

Have you had your tea, Huo-h ?'

No  o ; father said I was to stop here until
I had finished my sums.'

I glanced at the hopeless array of figures and
at the dog's-eared book, and then spoke with
decision :

Don't cry any more, Hugh ; it is babyish.
Boys ought not to cry. Go and wash your face;
sponge it well, and brush your hair ; and I will
bring you some tea. Why don't you open your
window wide ? there, the room will be fresher so.
Now do as I tell you, and I will be back
directly ;' and I nodded cheerfully and vanished.
Hugh was a great favourite with nurse, so she
willingly supplied me with all I wanted, and
even cut an extra large slice of cake.

Hugh had finished his ablutions when I returned
; but he could not call up a smile even

at the sight of the cake. Still, he was very
glad of the refreshing cup of tea, and I coaxed
him to eat by telling him an amusing story of
adventure that I had just read. It was deliciously
horrible  just what boys love, and the
anxious puckers in his face relaxed involuntarily
as he listened.

What a wonderful man he must have been,
Aunt Olcra ! I should like to be a traveller
when I grow up. Father says I shall never
make a clergyman, because I can't do my Latin,
and this morning he said I should not even do
for a business man,' and here his chest heaved
ominously. * I know I did my lesson badly ;
but I had to bury poor little Cuddy  you know
Cuddy, the white rabbit you liked so. He was
such a pretty little fellow. Something poisoned
him, and I found him dead this morning, and
Mr. Vivian made a coffin for him, and we had a
funeral, and the old gray rabbit had a crape

bow, and ' but I sternly checked these

reminiscences.

'We will talk by-and-by, Hugh; but it is
getting late, and I want to help you with those
sums  at least, I will explain the principle, and
you must work them out yourself.'

Hugh nodded, and sat staring at me with his
beautiful eyes, trying with all his might to understand
my instruction ; but it was hard work. I

could comprehend Hubert's fit of disgust and
impatience. Hugh was dreadfully slow. We
succeeded at last, but not before Hugh complained
that his headache had returned ; so I
persuaded him to go to bed.

I will put the books in your father's study,'
I said ; ' but there is no need for you to come
downstairs. You have worried yourself into a
fever. You see, the sums were not so difficult
after all.'

You made it all so easy. You explain
things so nicely, auntie. Oh, if I were only as
clever as you and mother ! I wonder what
makes me so stupid ? Do you think I was born
so ? It is not really naughtiness, as father
thinks ; it is not, really, Aunt Olga.'

I told him that I was sure of that, and he
looked a little happier at this assurance, and just
at this minute Kitty interrupted us. She was
dressed for dinner ; but I could see from her
eyes that she had been crying.

Hugh has done his sums,' I observed hastily ;
but his head aches, and I persuaded him to goto
bed.'

My head does really ache, mother,' added
Hugh anxiously.

Kitty went up to him without a word and
felt his forehead and hands ; then she glanced at
the empty tray ; finally she sat down by his bed.

Hugh, who adored his mother, threw his
arms round her.

Are you going to stop with me a little ?' he
said joyfully. ' Aunt Olga has been so kind.
She showed me how to do my sums. I did try
so hard, mother, only father will not believe it.*

Are you sure you tried, Hugh ?' And then she
continued sadly, ' You are making your father
and me very unhappy. I don't think father has
ever been so angry with you before. He says
he cannot teach you any longer  that you must
2fo to school.'

The boy's arms fell away from her neck in a
moment. He seemed to shrink into himself at
this announcement.

Oh, mother!' was all he said; but his tone
touched Kitty's motherly heart. She was very
tender with her children.

Father has tried his very best,' she said
softly ; ' but he feels it is all no use  that a
stranger will teach you better. He has been
talking to me about it, and I can see he means
what he says !'

Shall you let me go, mother?' in a reproachful
voice.

I must let you go,' she replied quietly ; ' you
are father's boy as well as mine, and he knows
what is best for you. I don't want to part with
you, my darling,' as the boy lay shaking with

sobs, and she stooped over and kissed him very
lovingly ; ' but I must help father to do his
duty. He is not sending you away because he
does not love you ; but because he knows it will
be best for you to learn with other boys.'

The gong sounded at this moment, and I was
obliged to go ; but I left Hugh more comfortably.
I knew Kitty would not leave him
until she had drawn the sting from his pain.
Her maternal instinct was very strong. She
was always at her best with her children.

When I had finished dressing I stole to the
half-opened door and peeped in. Kitty was on
her knees beside the bed. She seemed speaking
very solemnly, though I could not hear the
words. When she had finished, Huo;h said :

Mother dear, won't you say another prayer,
asking that I may be a clever boy ? I often
do.'

I don't think those sort of prayers help us,
dear,' she returned gently. ' Perhaps it is God's
will that you are not as quick as other boys ot
your age. It may be your trial ; we all have
our trials, Hugh. Only try to believe that
father loves you as much as he does Wilfred
and the twins, and that we are only sending
you away for your own good ; and ask God to
make you brave, and more willing to go  that
is a much better prayer.'

Very well, mother. Now you must go
down to dinner ; I must not keep you any
longer.'

Good-night, then, my dearest boy !'

What put it into Kitty's mind to say that ?
Was he, after all, her dearest, although at times
she had seemed hard to him ? I could fancy
the happy smile on Hugh's face. The boy
doted on his parents. If he could only bring
himself to believe that he was as dear to them
as their clever, sprightly Wilfred, he would bea
far happier boy.

I drew back from the door as Kitty came
out ; but I could not help kissing her for being
so nice to Hugh. There was a wonderfully
gentle expression on her face as she smiled
back at me ; but she did not speak, neither
did I.

THE lady's walk.'

'Tis life whereof our nerves are scant ;
More life and fuller that we want.
No heart in which was healthful breath
Has ever truly longed for death.'

Wordsworth.

Hugh's childish griefs had banished the tragical
recollections of last night from my memory, but
they revived with added intensity when, later
in the evening, a note arrived from the Hall.
Aunt Catherine was going to London on business
the next morning, and would be away the
whole day. Mrs. Lyndhurst was more unwell
than usual, and  here the words were underlined
 would I take my work and spend the
afternoon with her, and so shorten the hours of
her loneliness ?

There could be only one response to this.
I was accustomed to these friendly demands ;
it was quite a usual thing for me to sit with

Mrs. Lyndhurst during her sister's brief absences
in town ; nevertheless, for the first time
I was unwilling to obey the summons. When
I passed the note to Jem I looked at him
meaningly and shrugged my shoulders, but his
sole answer was a blank stare. This vexed
me, and I said with some degree of pettishness
:

These visits to town are endless just now ;
it is rather a bore leaving home so much during
your last week  don't you think so ?'

If Aunt Catherine wants you, I don't think
we ought to consider ourselves,' he replied in
the most indifferent voice. That was the worst
of Jem  he never would encourage what he
called sentimentality ; with all his affection forme
 and I believe he felt far more than he
expressed  he always damped anything like
effusion ; lingering leavetakings, terms of endearment,
or unnecessary caresses were abhorrent
to his somewhat stoical nature.

This little appeal that vaguely implied a
necessity for his presence did not touch him in
the least, and when I begged him rather
urgently to keep himself free for the following
afternoon, that we might have a nice long walk
together, he returned dryly that Vivian had
already booked him for a bicycle trip.

This was too much for my philosophy.

Oh, Jem, and we shall only have two whole
days together after that!'

Jem put down his carving tools ; he was
making a bracket for Kitty, and looked at me
with profound anxiety.

Do you feel ill, Olga ? This is the first I
have heard about it, but '  with a glance at
the timepiece  ' it is not so very late, scarcely
half-past nine, so I can easily go down for Dr.
Langham.'

What do you mean ?" I returned, utterly
bewildered.

Had Jem taken leave of his senses ? he was
actually holding my hand and fumbling at my
pulse ; but I wrenched it from him quite crossly.

I thought you were going to die or do something
equally disagreeable, as we had only two
whole days before us ; it made me feel quite
bad for a moment ;' and the tiresome boy sighed
heavily, and took up his tools again. And then
what did he do but paraphrase Airs. Hemans's
exquisite lite lament : * Oh, call my sister back
to me ! I cannot play alone;' but I would not
listen to him.

I am afraid I was decidedly cross with Jem
that night  as though he cared ! I heard him
laughing as I left the room. I would not say
good-night to him. Yes, 1 made up my mind
that that would be a fitting punishment for his

VOL. I. 7

hard-heartiness and want of feeling. I knew
the resolution would cost me a good cry, for I
was so fond of Jem that I could not bear to
be angry with him for a moment, and I very
seldom was ; but his manner was decidedly
trying this evening ; and he must be taught
that a sister had feelings. As I was still in the
same humour half an hour afterwards, I went
up to my room, taking no notice of Jem, who was
still busy with his bracket ; but a short time
afterwards there was a great flap against my
door. It was a sound I knew well, most likely
Rollo wanted some water ; but when I opened
it there was Rollo wagging his huge tail with
an air of immense satisfaction, and holding a
brown-paper parcel in his mouth, which he
dropped at once at my feet. I eyed it gingerly.
Could Harry have dared ? I was quite afraid
to touch it; it was so unpleasant giving back

presents, and yet if I kept it but I was too

sensible to think of doings such a things. I
hesitated so long that Rollo whined and scratched
at the parcel with his clumsy paw, as much as
to say, ' Why don't you open it ?' So, to keep
him quiet, I untied the string.

But to my delight it was not from Harry at all;
it was actually from Jem. Oh, the dear fellow !
it was his own handiwork, a pretty little carved
box with a lock and key, that he had made to

surprise me, most likely  his parting gift ! 1 1
was quite empty. No, there was a folded paper
inside. I opened it eagerly  a copy of verses !
Oh, Jem, how delicious !

Oh ! call my brother back to me,
But do not call too loud.
Poor chap ! alas, I warrant thee
He lies within his shroud !'

and so on.

At this moment I heard a low whistle.
Rollo heard it, too, for he pricked up his glossy
ears and vanished. I followed and peeped
over the banisters. Jem was coming lazily
upstairs with his candle, but he suddenly thought
better of it, and deliberately sat down on the
staircase, while Rollo squatted on his haunches
beside him. In this position the most remarkable
colloquy ensued.

I say, Rollo, old fellow, what's up with Olga?
Tell us, there's a good chappie.'

Don't be vulgar, Jem,' in a hoarse voice ;
'* chappie's " low, dear boy.'

Oh, shut up ! none of that.'

Well,' still more hoarsely, ' mind your
manners then ; but I am sorry to tell you the
missis is horribly cross.'

No, you don't say so.'

*In a regular passion. "Rollo," says she,
'' where's that rude, unfeeling boy, Jem ?" says

72

she. '' Talk of brothers, he's a regular bad one,"
says she, '' and I should like to box his ears ; but
as I shall only have a brother for two whole
days " and here she fetches out her handkerchief
and cries awful.'

Awfully, Rollo, awfully !' but here I came
upon Jem like a whirlwind ; and if, as he said
afterwards, he had not had the presence of mind
to blow out the candle, nobody would have
known what might or might not have happened,
for he was in imminent danger of strangulation.

But in spite of his struggles and Rollo's wild
barks of joy I managed to thank him my own
way.

He was quite limp and melancholy when I
got him into my room at last, and looked at
Rollo in a very feeling manner.

 What a pity our nice little tete-astute was interrupted,'
he observed sadly ; ' my peculiar
nature needs sympathy and plenty of it'' what
I takes I takes strong," as the charwoman observed
when the cabman pressed her to take
a glass of something 'ot  that's the way the
lower orders talk ; *' but, old chappie," says
she '

Now, Jem, I will not have it  not a word
more ; it is no use your pretending to be vulgar
of course I understand what your ridiculous
remarks meant.'

Indeed !' and Jem looked at me stolidly 
such an absence of expression I never saw in
any human face.

 Yes, you wanted me to understand that
these little matters of detail do not matter a bit ;
that I have got you, and you have got me '

Observe how exquisitely worded,' groaned
the incorrigible Jem ; * go ahead, Olga  you
have got me and I have got you ; all right,
what comes next ?'

This ;' and then I did actually box Jem's
ears, and he called out and Rollo barked
furiously, and Hubert's voice was heard in the
distance asking what on earth was the matter 
were we going to wake the children ? And
then Jem gave me a hasty kiss and fled. How
I laughed when Rollo and I were left alone !
Jem could be ridiculous when he liked, but
all the same he meant to teach me a little
lesson.

This absurd scene had refreshed me, and I
set off for the Hall the next day in much better
spirits. I found Mrs. Lyndhurst in her private
sitting-room, a small room on the first floor,
with a window overlooking the Elm Avenue.
It was not so handsomely furnished as the
library, which was Aunt Catherine's special
sanctum, but it was a pleasant room nevertheless
; the furniture was old-fashioned, and the

walls were covered with family portraits, but
there was an air of cosiness about it. Mrs.
Lyndhurst was lying back in a low cushioned
chair that she used as a lounge. As I entered
she held out her hand to me with a beseeching
look ; It was a look that seemed to say a good
deal  to claim, in a dumb sort of way, a large
portion of forbearance and sympathy. I never
knew eyes to express so much ; to-day they
reminded me of some animal in pain ; for the
first time I felt confused as I met them.

You are very good to come so early, Olga,'
she said, without noticing my embarrassment ;
will you take off your hat ? I see you have
brought your work ; that is nice. I have not
been feeling myself for some days, so Catherine
thought your company would be soothing.
You see I am so used to you,' with an affectionate
smile ; ' the society of some young
people would make me restless, but I never
feel so with you.'

This little compliment touched me.

I always like coming here,' 1 returned
graciously. ' Jem walked with me to the door ;
he sent his love to you ; he was so sorry that
you were not well enough to see him. Bennett
told us so.'

I thought Mrs. Lyndhurst looked disturbed ;
her face clouded.

Quite right ; Bennett knew that 1 was not fit
to talk to young men. Jem is a nice boy  a
very nice boy ; Catherine is exceedingly fond of
him. But no, I could not see him ; it would
have troubled me  it '

She passed her hand over her forehead as
though she were tired or harassed ; a sort of
feebleness came into her face. I do not know
how to describe the expression, but it always
distressed me when she looked like that, so I
hastened to set her mind at ease.

Jem quite understands  he never minds
being sent away. Perhaps you may be well
enough in a day or two to bid him good-bye 
he is going back to Oxford on Tuesday ; oh, I
am so sorry ! Fircroft is never the same without
Jem ; he is so full of life, he energizes so,
he puts spirit into one's daily existence  oh, I
do not know how to express it, but he seems to
pervade the whole house.'

The other young men will be still there,
will they not ?' she said, smiling a little at my
enthusiasm.

Yes, but they are just young men ; nobody
wants them. They are often in the way ;
young men are so stupid. Perhaps Mr. Vivian
is an exception. He is really nice ; not at all
insipid or slow, like the others ; but he is not
Jem.'

Jem will not always be the first, Olga.'

Yes, indeed he will,' rather vehemently, for
though of course I knew what Mrs. Lyndhurst
meant  and why will middle-aged people always
hint at these sort of things ?  I felt confident
in my own mind that no one but Harry
would ever think me attractive, or want to make
love to me, and I should certainly never listen to
him. Harry would never be anything but a nice
boy to me.

Well, well, we shall see. Now, Olga, do
you feel inclined to read to me ? The box has
come down from Muche's, and there are some
nice new books. You can choose any you
like.'

This was an unexpected treat. Mrs. Lynd-
hurst did not often ask me to read to her ; but
she seemed too fatigued to talk much, so I
made my selection and read aloud with the
greatest enjoyment to myself, and, I hope, to
her, until Mrs. Lyndhurst's maid brought up
the tea. Marsden was a kind-hearted creature,
and devoted to her mistress, and she always
seemed pleased to see me. She smiled as she
placed the low table beside me and arranged
the cups and saucers.

I am glad you are able to come, ma'am,'
she said pleasantly, ' for my mistress seems a
little low to-day.'

That is no new thing, Martens returned
Mrs. Lvndhurst, who had overheard this.

It is none the better for being old, is it,
ma'am ? and I am sure Miss Olga's company is
always good for you. Young folk have cheerful
ways with them. Will you ring for anything
you want, ma'am ?'

And Marsden, with another benevolent look
at us both, withdrew.

Making tea at the Hall was one of my minor
luxuries ; it was a pleasure to me to handle the
beautiful Worcester cups, while the mere sight
of the little melon-shaped silver teapot, with its
rich chasing, and the quaint dumpy cream-jug,
eave me a feeling of satisfaction. I was, like
other girls, very partial to pretty things. It
was so peaceful at the Hall this afternoon ;
only the hoarse cawing of the rooks broke the
stillness. The avenue looked as quiet as
though it were a glade in an enchanted forest ;
patches of sunlight were chequered by faint
purple shadows, while a zigzag of golden mist,
shot through with radiant colour, seemed to
stretch between the tree-boles like a fairy-ladder,
all vaporous brightness. We talked
for a little while, and then I took up the book
again ; and so the time passed, until Marsden
came to warn her mistress that it was time to
dress for dinner. I rose to take my leave, but,

to my surprise, Mrs. Lyndhurst refused to part
with me. I had done her good, she said, and,
as Catherine would be late, I might stay and
keep her company. My white dress was quite
nice enough for anything, and Bennett should
send a message to Fircroft ; and, as Marsden
looked at me rather wistfully, as though she
would beg me not to refuse her mistress, I consented
to remain.

So it was settled, and Mrs. Lyndhurst and I
dined in state in the big dining-room, waited
upon by Bennett, the white-haired butler, and
his subordinate, Reynolds. Mrs. Lyndhurst
hardly spoke, and ate very little, and the
silence was only broken by the servants' quiet
movements about the room. Now and then I
looked up, and saw the whole scene reproduced
in a long mirror that hung opposite to me.
The sad, pathetic-looking woman, in her black
draperies, sitting silently at the head of the
table, and facing her a slim girl in a white
gown, with smooth brown hair, and large
questioning eyes that seemed to appeal against
the dulness. I think Bennett felt for me, for
he handed me everything himself without
waiting for Reynolds ; and there was something
persuasive in his tone as he named the various
dainties, as though he feared a refusal. Bennett
and I were on excellent terms. At the Hall

I was generally Miss Olga to the servants,
never Miss Leigh.

Mrs. Lyndhurst proposed a turn in the
garden after dinner, and to this I willingly
assented. The long sitting had cramped my
young limbs. I felt restless, as though I
wanted to run, to laugh, to do anything, in fact,
but accommodate my steps to Mrs. Lyndhurst's
languid pace ; but she took my arm, and leant
rather heavily on it, as though she were weary.
As usual, she led the way to the Lady's Walk,
and I dared not remonstrate. The sun was
setting, but under the thick shade of trees it
was already twilight, and the old eerie feeling
crept over me.

Mrs. Lyndhurst did not seem to notice my
uneasiness. The soft evening air refreshed
her, and she began talking in her ordinary
way :

You have done me good, Olga. I am glad
Catherine proposed sending for you ; but it has
been a long dull day for you, my dear.'

Not at all,' I interposed hastily.

It is kind of you to say so ; but I am not an
amusing person. Catherine is used to me, and
so she puts up with all my odd ways. After all,
there is nothing like a sister. Catherine has
been far too good to me all her life. I am a
great trouble to her, but she never wall own it.'

I knew the sisters were devoted to each
other ; but they were not demonstrative, and
seldom spoke of their feelings. I was glad to
hear Mrs. Lyndhurst express herself after this
grateful fashion, for I knew she often gave Aunt
Catherine a great deal to bear.

You will miss her very much when she goes
to St. Croix.'

*Yes; but I must not think of that,' she returned
quickly. ' One must not consider oneself
in the matter. There is business to be done
important business  and no one can do it but
Catherine  she is so strong, so clear-headed.
She is so different to me altogether. I am not
old, Olga, in spite of my gray hairs, and yet the
time has come to me when the grasshopper
is a burthen. Do you remember how the Wise
Man puts it : " And fears shall be in the way " ?
It seems to me as though I dread my own
shadow sometimes.'

I wish I could help you and Aunt Catherine,'
I began wistfully, but I dared not proceed.

Mrs. Lyndhurst gave me a furtive look.
She understood without words what I meant.

That is for Catherine to decide. She has
been talking to me again. She makes me
miserable  as though I had not enough to bear
without that. I do not like reposing confidence
in young people  they are so hard, they judge

SO severely. It is the old who are merciful, who
know, how to make excuses

Mrs. Lyndhurst, it is you who are hard now.
When you were young you would not have said
that.'

Was I ever young ?  it is very long ago
then ; but you must not quote me as an example.
Olga.'

Why not ?' rather curiously.

Because I was not good  not what a girl
ought to be. I was self-willed, and bent on having
my own way. Catherine would tell you that she
does not condone the past, for all her pity. If I
had only listened to her, if I had allowed her
to be my conscience, I should not be the lonely,
unhappy woman I am now.'

She seemed profoundly agitated, and I dared
not question her any more ; but my thoughts
were very busy over this speech. Why was
Mrs. Lyndhurst lonely? she had Aunt Catherine;
and, in reality, Aunt Catherine was just as
lonely as she, and yet I had never heard Aunt
Catherine complain.

It might be that in her secret heart she would
have preferred a fuller life ; that the love of
husband and children would have been as
precious to her as to other women ; but she
never bemoaned her solitary state  on the
whole, she seemed busy and happy. Perhaps

I was not competent to judge ; but it always
seemed to me that the position of the ladies at
the Hall was singularly enviable. They had
wealth, freedom and consideration ; they were
beloved by their poorer neighbours, and respected
and liked by all who shared their
friendship. After all, was it a bad thing to be
free as air, to do what one liked, to follow one's
bent unchecked and untrammelled by a husband ?
That obedience was a formidable item in the
marriage ceremony  to love would be comparatively
easy ; but to voluntarily submit to a
master was quite another thing. I began to
take counsel with myself, if it would not be as
well always to remain Olga Leigh.

I was roused from this reverie by a touch on
my arm. Mrs. Lyndhurst was looking at me
fixedly ; her manner was full of suppressed
melancholy.

Do not take example by me, Olga,' she said
imploringly ; ' if I had my life over again  oh,
if we only could !  how differently I would act
now ! It is terrible to grow old, my dear, when
one's youth has been a failure. It is as though
some inexorable power were compelling us to
sit still and watch the result of our life-work
we cannot turn our eyes away if we would 
*' Give an account, add up the losses of the years
before death comes," that is what it says ;

and some of us who are miserable bankrupts
fear to turn over a single leaf

Dear Mrs. Lyndhurst, we are none of us
without faults.'

But some are more guilty than others, Olga.
You are young, but you are good and true ;
keep so ; dread the first stain of wrong-doing.
One wrong act involves another, until we are
entangled in our own web. I am talking
strangely to-night, dear child ; but one of my
melancholy fits is on me, and the sense of loss
is heavier than usual' She paused, and I could
see her eyes were full of tears. ' It is getting
late now, and you must go home. Leave me
to take a turn by myself; solitude often soothes
me.'

'Must I go, Mrs. Lyndhurst?'

Yes, my child, I think it better ; but tomorrow
you may come to us again.'

She kissed my cheek with her cold lips and
turned away. I was left by myself, and the
uncanny feeling returned  Lady Gwendoline
might be near me. I sped away through the
garden-paths as though my feet were winged ;
only once I looked back. The moon had just
risen, its faint, silvery light illumined the dark
walk. Mrs. Lyndhurst was pacing up and
down it slowly. I could see her tall, graceful
figure distinctly ; she had drawn her lace-scarf

over her gray hair, and she looked weird and
strange in the dim Hight. Suddenly she stopped
and flung up her arms. I could see her thin
white hands clasping each other. ' Will it be
too late ?'  did I hear the words or only dream
them ? ' Too late for me ? too late for him T

UNLOCKING pandora's BOX.

Heigh ho ! daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall ;
A sunshiny world full of laughter and leisure,
And fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall !
Send down on their pleasure smiles passing its measure,
God that is over us all !'

Jean Angelo.

Soon after this I had to bid good-bye to Jem.
It was always a trying ordeal, and no amount
of usage could reconcile me to the parting.
The floods of tears that that boy cost me ! Not
that I would have let him know how I cried
my eyes out directly he was out of sight !
Jem's behaviour during the last few days had
not been wholly satisfactory. To tell the truth,
I found his light-hearted philosophy very trying
under the circumstances ; his cheerfulness was
almost aggressive. He took no notice of my
lugubrious looks, and while I was counting up
VOL. I. 8

the hours and minutes Hke a miser, and begrudging
every duty that called me away,
Jem lounged away his time in the young men's
study, talking nonsense with Harry Vivian, or
boxing or fencing with Mr. Campbell. The
bicycle trip had come off, and Jem had been
late for dinner that day, and though he had
invited me for a walk the following afternoon,
I found to my chagrin that Harry was to be of
the party. I could not help giving Jem a
reproachful look as Harry went on to open the
gate for Rollo, who was wild to get out.

What's the matter now ?' he asked Innocently.


Why did you ask Harry ?' I whispered
crossly, for really Jem was incorrigible ; ' you
might have remembered that I should want you
to myself for our last walk.'

But my remark did not make the least Impression
on him ; he only whistled, and then
began to laugh as though he were amused.

That's the way you mean to talk to your
young man, I suppose, if you ever get one ?'
observed the rude boy. ' You will have to mind
what you are about, Olga. Not many fellows
would be so good-natured as I am. Here are
Vivian and I putting ourselves out for your
pleasure, and this Is the way you treat us.
Vivian, I hope your young woman will behave

herself better than Olga does ; she is always
grumbling at me for something or other.
Why don't you do this or do that ? I have to
put my foot down pretty strongly, I can tell
you ; it is the only way when one has to deal
with girls,' finished Jem in a disgusted manner.

And then to punish me for objecting to that
tiresome Harry's company, he talked to him
exclusively for the next mile or two ; but he
was very nice the remainder of the way, as
though to make up for it.

It was always an understood thing that I
should help Jem pack, so on the last morning
I went up to his room. I thought Jem was in
better spirits than usual ; he rattled on volubly :
no other word would rightly express his bright
and inconsequent talk, or the rapidity with
which he hurried from one topic to another.

'Catch hold of these shirts,' and a pile of
linen descended on my lap ; ' ram them in hard,
Oloa. I don't believe women know how to
pack ; it wants a mathematical brain to calculate
distance and economize space. There are my
new socks,' a flutter of gaudily-striped things
aimed from the other end of the room, and
caught with difficulty ; ' now set to work, old
girl, while I pack my coats,' and Jem
whistled an air from ' Les Huguenots.' If
one or two tears dropped on the new shirts

82

no one was the wiser. Of course it was only-jem's
way, and it was natural that he should
be a little elated at the idea of his tutorship ; it
was such a beautiful house where he was ,Song,
and he would have plenty of fishing, and shooting,
and tennis, and a host of pleasant new
acquaintances, and what could a young man ask
more ? and of course he could not take me with
him, so I was a goose to fret ; but, still, if he
would only talk to me, or let me talk to him,
and not go on quoting French in that ridiculous
fashion.

Jem ate an excellent lunch ; he was joking
with Harry all the time. Harry was going
with him to the station  he did not address meat
all until the last moment. I had run up to
his room to see that nothing was left behind,
when I heard him spring up after me three
steps at a time.

Good-bye, old girl !' he said, catching hold
of me ; ' take care of yourself, and don't get
into mischief without me.'

Oh, Jem, don't go yet,' I implored ; ' I want
to speak to you.'

I can't stop, the cab's waiting ;' and he would
not let me detain him one moment. I followed
him to the door, and he waved his hand to me
with a cheery smile. Not even saying good-bye
to me for five whole months  for I should not

see him before he went back to Oxford  could
make Jem look grave, even for an instant. I
shut myself up in his empty room, and had
what women call a good cry, and it really did
me brood.

When I went into the drawing-room, two
hours later, feeling very sad and subdued, I
found Harry there alone. He was evidently
waiting for me, and I was quite sure, from his
voice, that he was very sorry for me.

It always seems strange without Jem, doesn't
it ?' were his first words. ' I am sure he felt
going away very much this time ; he was
terribly glum as we drove to the station  that
is not like Jem at all.'

Jem glum ! I could not believe my ears.

 He did not talk a bit, and seemed quite down,
poor old fellow. He does not like leaving
you. Miss Leigh, that's what it is ; and of course
it is natural  for if you were my sister '

And here Harry heaved a tremendous sigh
which aggravated me in my tender state, and
made me rather short with him.

But I am Jem's sister, you see.*

Yes,' and here Harry sighed again ; ' but if
there is anything I can do for you in Jem's
absence  any little service, I mean  I am sure
I would gladly do it ; it would be no end of
pleasure,' continued the poor boy rather sadly ;

for though I know I am nothing to you beside
Jem  and where would anyone find a nicer
fellow ?  still, I do think a lot of you, as you
know, and it would be just a happiness to me
to find out anything I could do for you.'

After all, sympathy is very soothing, especially
when one is very low, so I could not
help looking kindly at Harry, and thanking
him ; and I suppose my manner was softer than
usual, for the foolish fellow turned quite red
with pleasure.

You could not think of anything just now,
could you, Miss Olga ?'

No, not this minute ; but I will pour you
out a cup of tea, as Kitty is keeping us waiting.'
I did not like that ' Miss Olga,' it was too familiar
; and I did not quite like the expressive look
that accompanied it. Really, young men were
very difficult to manage ; to think of all the
snubs I had given Harry, and yet he presumed
to call me miss Olga ' in that tone. But I was
too low-spirited to resent it actively, and so
Harry had the best of it that day.

Jem wrote me a nice little note the next day,
to tell me of his safe arrival at Middleton Park.

I am in clover,' he wrote ; ' it is an awfully
jolly place  deer park, and such preserves, and
the house as big as a barrack. The widow '
(Mrs. Middleton had lost her husband the

previous year) * is very civil ; but, of course, she
is a trifle melancholy, which is to be expected,
poor thing ! and the boy is a nice fellow, only
not very robust. I expect to have a real good
time here, and to meet no end of swells. You
may write to me as often as you like, and mind
you tell me everything about yourself I always
feel responsible for you, and though I don't like
finding fault  being a soft-hearted fellow  there
is a vein of sentimentality in your character
that gives me a good deal of trouble. The
worst of an impulsive person is  you never
know what they are going to do next. But no
more of this, from your affectionate brother 
Jem

Perhaps people might say there was not
much in the note to make me feel so much
happier, but I could read a great deal between
the lines : Jem wanted to hear from me, he
was anxious to continue my confidant ; I was
to tell him anything and everything ; and,
best of all, his stoicism had been intended
as an antidote to my sentimentality, and was
not really want of feeling. And when I had
made all this clear to myself, I cheered up
immensely.

I was happier, too, about Hugh, after a little
conversation we had together.

I was sitting on the lawn one evening,

watching an exciting tennis match between
Harry and Mr. Campbell, when Hugh ran
over the grass and joined me.

Do you know where mother is, Aunt
Olga ?'

Yes, dear ; she is in the schoolroom. Mab
and Jessie wanted her to hear their new duet ;
they have been practising it so nicely. I am
sure she will be quite pleased to hear them.
Where have you been all the afternoon,
Hugh ?'

For the boy had a bright, excited look.
Hugh was not a handsome boy ; the twins
were decidedly pretty little girls, and Wilfred
had his father's well-cut features, but Hugh
was somewhat ordinary, and only his soft
brown eyes redeemed him from plainness.
Still, he was a gentlemanly-looking little fellow,
and, after all, a boy does not need beauty.

I have been with fattier,' he returned, in
answer to my question. ' We have been for
such a long walk  to Fletcher and round by
Wardle, which was ever so nice.'

You like a walk with father ?' For his
voice was quite eager.

Oh yes ! And he talked to me such a lot.
Aunt Olga  all about my rabbits, and the
chickens, and our new plan for the garden ;
and he has promised to let Mr. Vivian help us

build our new summer-house ; and. then '  here
Hugh's voice dropped a little  'he talked
about something else.'

You mean about the school ?'

Yes ; did you know it is all settled, and I
am to go to Mr.' Fulton's next term ? Father
says he knows Eastbourne well, and that it is
such a nice place, and that I am sure to like it.
There are eighty boys, and the house is so big,
and they have a field to play in, and three
times a week the boys go down to the sea to
bathe ; and they have cricket-matches, and purchases,
and all sorts of fun ; and he says, too,
that Mr. and Mrs. Fulton are such kind people,
and that he knows I shall be very happy there.'

Dear Hugh, I am so glad !'

That I did not like it at first, you know,
not until father talked to me. I used to cry
about it every time I went to bed. I did not
know what the twins would do without me ;
and there was mother. But father was ever so
nice'  Hugh's favourite expression; 'he told
me that he did not like parting with me, but that
he knew it would be for my good, and that I
should learn better with other boys ; and that if
I wanted to please him, and make him proud of
me, I must be brave, and not mind leaving
home, as my fretting made mother unhappy.
And so I promised, and he kissed me, and I

think there were tears in his eyes. So you see,
Aunt Olga '  with a curious blending of grief
and triumph in his tone  * father really does
love me, though I am so stupid. He said it
gave him great pain not to be able to keep me
with him ; and then he stopped suddenly and
began talking about other things, and then we
came home.'

I was very glad to hear Hugh's account, but
I had no opportunity to say more just then, for
Mab came running out of the house, closely
followed by Jessie as usual  no one ever saw
the twins apart.

Oh, Hughie !' she exclaimed breathlessly ;
mother is so pleased with our duet 1'

Yes ; and we are to play it to father this
evening,' added Jessie. ' We are to sit up on
purpose. Shall we ask mother to let you sit
up too ?'

Hugh must hear us, of course,' observed
Mab decidedly. Both of the twins were devoted
to Hugh. They each of them took a
hand as they spoke. ' Let us go and speak to
mother at once. Come, Hughie dear!'

And they carried him off. What a pretty
picture they looked  the little girls in their
white smocks, with their fair hair streaming
behind them, and Hugh's dark, closely-cropped
head between ! Once all the three heads

seemed to touch each other in their eager talk.
Two little arms went round Hugh's neck.

Oh, Hughie ! must you go ?' I heard Jessie
say in a very sorrowful voice.

Hugh was telling his story over again then.
There would be lamentations and tears when
Hugh left his little sisters ; he was at once
their master and their slave, the patient victim
of all their little whims, and the grateful recipient
of their overflowing affection.

Of course he must go if father sends him,'
remarked Mab, who was more strong-minded
than her sister. * Never mind, Hughie darling,
we will write you long letters and tell you about
the rabbits and everything, won't we, Jessie ?'
and then they each kissed him, and the arms
went round his neck again, and in this fashion
they proceeded solemnly to the house.

Kitty was not the woman to refuse such a
request. She was far too fond of spoiling her
little daughters. When the twins played their
duet that evening, Hugh was in the corner
beside the piano. Kitty watched them delightedly
:

Aren't they darlings?' her eyes seemed to ask.
Her voice was full of maternal pride when she
spoke.

Hubert was far more moderate.

Very nicely played, my dears,' ho. said when

they had finished. ' Kitty, my love, your pupils
do you credit,' and he made a bow to each of
them in turn. How the twins laughed! ' We
shall have great pleasure in seeing these
young ladies in the drawing-room again, eh,
Cunningham ? Now run away to bed, and,
Hugh, open the door for your sisters like a
gentleman.'

Hugh obeyed, but Harry and Mr. Campbell
were before him, and stood at the door like a
pair of sentries.

Thank you,' said Jessie, lifting up her sweet
little face rather shyly to the young man as she
passed ; but Mab, who saw the humour of the
situation, exploded into a little laugh.

Aren't big people funny sometimes ?' I heard
her say when they were outside. ' Why did
you get so red, Jessie ; you always do. I am
sure father liked our piece quite as well as
mother did.'

During the week that followed I saw very
little of Aunt Catherine. True, I had resumed
my old habits and went almost daily to the Hall,
but I saw most of Mrs. Lyndhurst. x\unt
Catherine was always busy and pre-occupied,
and never pressed me to stay.

*We shall have plenty of time to talk presently,'
she said once, dismissing me with a
wistful smile.

I had nearly finished my modest preparations
by this time. A new travelling-box, the joint
gift of Kitty and Hubert, stood in one corner of
my room. I used to look at it every night with
the pleasurable anticipation with which a pilgrim
might eye his staff and scrip. It was a sort of
Pandora's box to me, and most surely Hope
was at the bottom. Oh ! divine gift of all the
goddesses, the especial heritage of youth, with
what soft rainbow tints dost thou paint the
future ! what golden rays hover amongst those
misty distances  the visionary hilltops that
enclose the fabulous kingdom of the Might-be !
I verily believe that to my young home-bred
enthusiasm St. Croix seemed a sort of enchanted
place. In youth the very charm of
novelty is an exhaustive pleasure  to wake up
in a foreign land, to hear a different language,
to see fresh sights, to reap new experiences.
What could be more delightful ? It is the
tedium, the routine, the carelessness of daily
life, that weary the young. To inherit only a
small bare corner of the globe seems very pitiful
to the heir of all the ages.

In looking back on those days I am almost
tempted to exclaim with the aged Faust : ' Oh,
stay ; the moment is so fair !' As though one
could arrest that strange, sweet dreaming-time
that we call youth !

I was beginning to wonder when marching
orders would reach me, and to chafe a Httle
at the delay, when one morning one of Aunt
Catherine's brief notes was put into my hand.
All her arrangements were made, and she would
be glad to see me the following afternoon. Would
I come as soon after luncheon as possible  this
was all it said. I scribbled off an affirmative
answer, and then rushed upstairs in a high
state of excitement to try on the new tweed
dress and the hat that Kitty had trimmed forme.
Then, I am ashamed to say, I sat down
on the floor before my box and indulged in a
delicious day-dream  in which position I was
discovered by my nieces. The little girls
seemed mystified, and stood hand-in-hand at the
door regarding me in perplexed fashion.

May we come in, Aunt Olga ?' It was Mab
who spoke. ' We wanted you to tell us how to
dress our new doll.' It was always ' our doll ' 
our everything. The twins had everything
in common. 'You weren't busy, were you?'
eyeing my lowly position rather dubiously.
No, I was only thinking.'
Do you always think on the floor, auntie ?'
'Oh dear no. I do my thinking anywhere!'
We never think quite so hard, do we,
Jessie? We thought you were asleep, Aunt Olga;
your head was quite down on the box, and

Rollo was sitting up staring at you. It did
look so funny, didn't it, Jessie ?'

Very funny,' replied Jessie, who generally
repeated her sister's words with parrot-like
precision.

Mab had far more originality. Now, I do
not know what fit of idle mischief was on me
that I should infect those innocent little creatures
with my grown-up nonsense ; but I made them
sit down one on each side of me, while Rollo
blinked at us between his paws, and thereupon
I told them a wonderful tale of an enchanted
kingdom, called Dreamland, wherein all manner
of loveliness dwelt, and how there were magic
keys forged that would unlock the mysterious
portals, and how I was wandering in this strange,
fair country when they disturbed me.

I saw Mab knit her brows at this point,
as though she were trying to understand, but
Jessie exclaimed :

Why, you were sitting on the floor, auntie,
doing nothing at all !'

Nurse never likes us to do nothing,' put in
Mab ; ' she always says doing nothing is helping
to spin Satan's web. She says so, doesn't she,
Jessie ?'

This was not a pleasant idea. Could it be
possible that these spangles I was weaving
were any part of the arch adversary's work ?

Nurse's Puritan notions had spoiled everything.
My aerial car of fancy dropped from the
clouds.

My dear Mab I observed sententiously,
only clever people can talk nonsense. Little
girls like you cannot be expected to understand
everything. Now, where is the doll, that
I may give my opinion on her toilette ?'

And then, as Jessie produced her piece-bag,
we were soon as busy as bees. Why
do we always use that comparison ? Spiders
are busy, and worms and moles in a dark underground
way ; but to be busy as a worm somehow
suggests a crawling policy, and subterranean
deeds unfettered by wholesome daylight. To
be busy as beavers would be better and more
original. I do love those dear clever architects
and builders !

The next day, as ill-luck would have it 
Hubert would have preached me a sermon if
he had heard me use that most heathenish expression
 some old friends whom we had not
seen for years bore down upon us from an
unexpected quarter, invaded our luncheon-board,
and, upon pressing invitation, remained
to tea. It was in vain that I pleaded my engagement
with Aunt Catherine in an importunate
aside to Hubert. I must remain and
help Kitty entertain our guests, that was his 

reply. They would leave early, and I should
still have time to pay my visit to the Hall
before dinner.

If there were one point on which Hubert was
fussy, it was on the duty of hospitality, and the
necessity of putting ourselves out even for
those who were personally antagonistic to our
tastes. ' The law of kindness is too much set
aside in these days,' he remarked in my hearing
once, and I am afraid the admonition was intended
for my special benefit ; for Kitty was
always gracious to the most unwelcome visitor.
" Thy own friend and thy father's friend forsake
not." I am always reminded of that text when
I see young people yawning metaphorically in
the presence of their elders, and mentally
stigmatising them as unmitigated bores. We
should try to remember that by-and-by we shall
be old bores, too, and that a younger generation
will turn its cold shoulder to us. What a pity,
then, to withhold our kindly looks and words
where perhaps they are greatly needed. " Do
as you would be done by," that is the golden
rule, after all.'

Now as Hubert always tried to practise what
he preached in his own gentlemanly way, and
Kitty, like a true wife, aided and abetted him,
people generally stayed twice as long at Fircroft
as they would have done at any other house ;

VOL. I. 9

luncheon visitors remained to tea, and so on.
It is difficult to tear one's self away from this
delightful house, dear INIrs. Leigh; had often
been the speech of a gratified visitor, and on
the present occasion I really thought Colonel
Morrison and his sister would never go. I sat
literally on thorns the latter part of the afternoon.
I saw Kitty look at me reproachfully
once or twice as though she thought I was not
taking my fair share in the conversation.
Olga knows this,'  Olga will tell you that,'
she kept saying.  Olga, will you show Miss
Morrison the photo of Jem in his undergraduate's
cap and gown ?'  and so on.

Well, it was over at last. Hubert had taken
up his felt hat to walk with his visitors to the
gate, and Kitty had accompanied them to the
door. I saw my opportunity for making my
escape ; in another minute I was crossing the
lawn like a lapwing ; the kitchen garden, the
paddock, were soon left behind ; long before
Hubert had finished his good-byes I was walking
up the Elm Avenue, and the rooks were
cawing a welcome.

I encountered Bennett in the hall ; he told me
that Miss Seton was in the garden, that I
should find her by the sundial, and I proceeded
there at once.

I should have known where to have looked

for her, even if Bennett had not informed me ;
the seat by the sundial was her favourite place.
It was a quiet, sheltered spot, shut in bligh
walls covered with fruit-trees ; the broad walk
was planted with standard rose-trees, and every
few yards a rose-covered arch spanned the path.
In the rose season the effect was beautiful.

Aunt Catherine was in her usual seat, and
Jasper, her especial pet, was strutting up and
down before her, trailing his glorious tail behind
him, followed by the mincing steps of his
humbler consort. Beryl. She held out her hand
to me, with her quiet, welcoming smile.

You are late,' she said gently ; ' I was beginning
to fear that you were not coming
after all.'

Oh, it has been so tiresome !' I exclaimed,
and I began to explain volubly the reason of
my delay ; but Aunt Catherine heard me rather
absently  she was evidently thinking of something
else.

What does it matter ?' she said, when I had
finished ; ' you are here now, and there is plenty
of time for our talk. Look at Jasper !' for the
beautiful creature had mounted the sundial and
was slowly unfurling his plumes. ' Virginia
had a headache, and remained in her room, so
I had tea alone, and came out here. I wanted
to see you especially this evening, Olga.

92

Do you guess what it is I have to say to
you ?'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, do you mean that you
are really going to tell me your business at
St. Croix ?'

Yes, child, I am. I think, after all, it will be
best. Virginia is against it  that is what has
caused her headache ; she knows I mean to tell
you this evening. I am reposing great trust in
you, Olga, but I know you are reliable.'

I squeezed her hand without making any
reply ; words were hardly needed, Aunt
Catherine and I understood each other.

Well, then, I may as well tell you at once
that I am going to St. Croix solely and entirely
on Virginia's account ; that the business is hers,
not mine.' She paused, as though she found it
difficult to proceed. ' We have obtained a clue
at least, I hope to obtain it  a clue by which
we may discover a treasure she has lost.'

Was that all ? but her manner was very
strange.

What sort of treasure do you mean, Aunt
Catherine ?'

I mean Virginia's son,' she answered
calmly.

Virginia's story.

" What is good for a bootless bene ?"
The falconer to the lady said :
And she made answer : "Endless sorrow !"
For she knew her son was dead.'

Anon.

I UTTERED an exclamation, and almost jumped
from my seat. Never, never in my whole life
had I been so surprised ! But Aunt Catherine
did not look at me. She merely repeated the
words, with a certain dreary inflexion, as though
she had learned them by rote :

I am going to look for Virginia s son.'
But, Aunt Catherine,' I stammered, turning
very red, for I was so confused, so taken aback
altogether, that I hardly knew what to say, ' no
one in Brookfield knows that Mrs. Lyndhurst
ever had a child.'

Dr. Langham has always known it,' she returned
composedly. ' And now you know our

secret, Olga  the secret of my sister's unhappy
life. He was only a year old when she lost him,
and that was five-and-twenty years ago.*

Five-and-twenty years ! I could scarcely
realize it. I knew that Mrs. Lyndhurst had
married young, and that she was three or four
years older than Aunt Catherine. Her son
must be a full-grown man of six-and-twenty.
How had she lost him ? What did it all mean ?

All at once I recalled the evening when Jem
and I had wandered in the Hall garden, and we
had encountered the weird, ghost-like figure in
the Lady's Walk ; and again a sudden flash of
memory brought before me vividly the pale
face and silvery hair over which the white hood
was drawn so closely ; and the words sounded
in my ears as though they were freshly uttered :
Oh, my sin ! Will it never be condoned ?
Will there never be an end to all this suspense
and misery ?' and ' God only knows !' uttered
in a despairing voice.

Olga '  and here Aunt Catherine looked at
me pleadingly, and I could see she was much
agitated  ' my great fear in telling you this
miserable story is this, that you will blame
Virginia ; but you must not  indeed, you must
not. She has been very weak ; she has suffered
and the pain has been too great for her. Weare
not all alike ; some of us are stronger to

endure than others. I would have you remember
this, and not judge her harshly. Who
should know her so well as I do ? and I have
never blamed her, except for marrying Paul
Lyndhurst.'

Will you tell me all about it, Aunt
Catherine ?'

I will tell you as much as it is necessary for
you to know ; but there are some things that
must not be repeated, neither do I care to
dwell on the story of Virginia's mad infatuation
for her lover. Why is it, Olga  but you are
too young to answer such a question  why is it
that an evil nature  an utterly perverted and
immoral nature  can ever dominate and gain
the mastery over an innocent one ? Virginia
was good  yes, in spite of her little faults and
vanities, she was a good, pure-minded girl 
but her love for Paul Lyndhurst blinded her.
She would believe nothing against him 
nothing.'

I have heard  I think it was Hubert who
told me  that Mr. Lyndhurst was a singularly
handsome man.'

You are right ; I think his face was almost
perfect. The features were finely-cut, as we
see them in Greek sculpture ; his physique was
magnificent ; he was just a beautiful, soulless
animal. I was very young then, not more

than eighteen or nineteen, and very shy and
diffident ; but I had my ideal  every girl has
that, I suppose.' She caught her breath and
hurried on : 'I cared for goodness in a man
more than any degree of attractiveness, and I
used to shrink instinctively from the subtle
sneer that lurked in Paul Lyndhurst's handsome
eyes.

I remember once arguing with Virginia
until I was on the verge of tears.

" You must not have him," I said ; " he is
not good. I am. sure he is not good, Virginia.
He says horrid, sneering things in a polite way.
Oh, his manners are fine  I know that  but he
is inwardly cruel ! I am sure of it. He dislikes
old and plain people. He makes fun of
them, and derides their little infirmities ; and
he is not kind to animals. See how he treated
his dog yesterday ! Oh, Virginia ! do struggle
against this infatuation ! Rome is a bad place
for you. Let us ask father to take us away.
We shall be safer at Brookfield  dear old
Brookfield !"

But I might as well have spoken to the wind.

*' You are prejudiced," she said coldly ; " Paul
said only yesterday that you had disliked him
from the first, and that it was because he was
poor and had no friends. You are hard on him,
Catherine. He Is very unhappy. He says he has

not a friend in the world but me ; that there is no
hope for him if I forsake him ; but I never will give
him up  he knows that, my dear, noble Paul !"

Ah, he had bewitched her, or she never could
have used that word of Paul Lyndhurst.

Of course, I know now, Olga, that I ought
to have warned my father, but we were too
much in awe of him for any such confidence.
If our mother had lived I would have spoken to
her at once ; but our father  no, it was impossible.
I dreaded his anger too much. It is
a sad thing, Olga, when children fear their
parents. Virginia had always been our father's
favourite. She was a bold, high-spirited girl,
and he was very proud of her. It was Virginia
who was always the spokeswoman  who could
coax him to do anything ; but I was timid and
awkward in his presence. It needed more
courage than I possessed to tell him the state
of things between Virginia and Paul Lyndhurst ;
and, as though to accelerate matters, father had
taken a strong fancy to the young artist, and
had him perpetually to the house.

Our stay at Rome was drawing to a close, and
I was beginning to breathe more freely, hoping
that time and absence would weaken Virginia's
unhappy attachment, when all at once the
blow fell ! Without giving me a hint of her rash
resolve  without bidding good-bye Virginia

left the house secretly one morning and was
married to Paul Lyndhurst, and when the news
reached us she was on her way to Venice with
her husband ! Olga, It is useless to dwell too
much on a painful past. I will leave you to
imagine my father's bitter anger and my own
grief. I saw the letter he wrote in answer to
her piteous plan for forgiveness  it was a cruel
letter for any father to write ; but I can make
more allowances now. He told her that she was
no child of his now, that he would never see
her again, that he had done with her for ever.
She had disgraced her name. He would never
acknowledge the beggarly artist she called her
husband. Her little fortune, bequeathed to herby
her mother  about three thousand pounds 
should be made over to her at once ; but she
need never expect a penny of his  it should all
be Catherine's. Poor father, he was almost
beside himself with anger and mortified love
when he wrote that letter.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, how dreadful !'  for she
paused a moment in her recital.

Yes,' she replied gently ; ' such scenes and
such words are very dreadful to remember ; one
longs for a draught from Lethe sometimes. My
child, those two years were the saddest years
of my life. I had my own troubles, and the
Hall was desolate to me without Virginia. I

had never been my father's companion, and I
could do Httle to comfort him in his trouble.
In my heart I reproached him for his hardness ;
but I never dared to mention Virginia's name.
Now and then during the first year of her
absence she wrote to me, but her letters were
very brief and unsatisfactory. She seldom
mentioned her husband's name, or said she
was happy. My questions on that point
were left unanswered. They were always
moving from place to place  one letter was
from Naples, the next from Munich, a third from
Basle. I never knew where to find her, and
more than one of my letters came back to me.
The last one I received was written in pencil,
and told me of the birth of her boy.

"' He is not like Paul," she wrote ; '* he is more
like our family, and I mean to call him Basil,
after our little brother who died. Perhaps when
my father hears that, he maybe touched. How I
long to show you my baby, Catherine ! He is
such a pretty little fellow, and so good ; he
hardly ever cries. My husband does not wish
to have him baptized. Paul is a freethinker,
you know, and laughs at my superstition, as he
calls it ; but my baby shall not grow up a
heathen. I am determined upon that. If there
be no other way, one of those kind-looking
priests at St. Sulpice shall baptize him. I

would rather have him baptized in the Roman
Catholic Church than have him a heathen ; but
there is plenty of time." The letter ended
abruptly here ; but a postscript had been added
a few days later : " I have been ill again and
could not finish this, I will send it as it is. Do
not be anxious if you do not hear again soon.
Paul does not like me to write ; he says I have
no one but him now. Oh, Cathy, darling, why
did I not listen to you ? I have sown the wind
to reap the whirlwind. Baby is prettier than
ever ; he grows so fast. God bless you. Your
loving sister, Virginia."

I laid my letter on my father's desk. I had
never dared to show him one before. When
I went into the study the next morning it was
gone ; but he never spoke of it. I thought it
had been destroyed ; but after his death we
found it in an old pocket-book he always carried
about with him. The letter was creased and
almost illegible, and in its folds was the tiny
lock  scarcely more than a few hairs  poor
Virginia had cut off her infant's head. I remember
how bitterly Virginia cried when she saw it.'

As Aunt Catherine again paused her eyes
were full of tears.

Oh, it is all so sad  so sad,' she went on, * it
gives me the heartache even now to remember
it. I noticed a change in my father from that

day ; he become more abstracted and melancholy,
nothing seemed to interest him. At
times he seemed restless and unsettled. Now
and then, as we sat alone together, he with his
book, and I with my embroidery, he would look
at me fixedly, as though he wanted to say something
; and then his lips would close more firmly
than ever, and he would turn away and take up
his book again. I used to wonder sometime
if he were thinking of Virginia, but I dared not
ask him the question.

One night  it was a wild autumnal night, I
remember, for the wind was crashing among
the elms, and I heard the fall of a great branch
once  we were startled by the loud ringing of a
bell. It was late, and the servants had just gone
up to bed, so my father went to the door and
undid the bolts himself, while I followed him.

As he flung the door wide open, a tall veiled
lady, muffled up in a foreign-looking mantle,
quietly stepped into the hall.

We were both much startled. '' Madam "

began my father, in his quick, haughty way, but
the lady put back her veil and looked at him.
'' Good heavens ! it is Virginia!' he exclaimed,
turning very pale.

'' Yes, father, I am come back. Will you
take me in ? Shall I go down on my knees to
you ?" She laughed rather strangely ; her eyes

were wide and glittering. '' Cathy, why do
you not kiss me ? Have you forgotten we are
sisters ? Do you know what I have done ?
I have run away from Paul ! I have left him,

and I have left " but here her face became

very white, she put out her hands as though
feeling blindly for some support, and if my
father had not caught her she would have
fallen at his feet in that deathly swoon. We
were unwilling to summon help, so we carried
her between us, and, laying her down on the
drawing-room couch, applied all possible remedies
; but it was a long time before she
recovered consciousness, and she did not speak
to us again that night. She lay motionless, with
closed eyes, only every now and then a convulsive
shudder seemed to shake her from head
to foot. If my father's anger had ever been
bitter against her, it died a natural death now.
He only seemed to remember that she had
come back to him again. Her very helplessness
and misery appealed strongly to his fatherhood.
He sat beside the couch holding her
hand, and every now and then stroking it, and
once he looked at me pitifully, as though to
demand sympathy. My poor father ! the furrows
of his hardness were broken up for ever ! I
knew then how he had loved her, and how
cruelly his pride in her had been wounded.

She was sadly changed, our poor Virginia !
Her girlish beauty was gone ; she looked ten
years older than when we had seen her last.
Her face was drawn and haggard, and there
were dark circles round her eyes. In the
broken-down creature before us, who could have
recognised our bright, high-spirited girl ?

I thought that night would never have
passed. Now and then she opened her eyes
and looked at us, but only a low moan escaped
her lips. Towards morning my father roused
the servants, and sent off one of them for Dr.
Langham  it was old Dr. Langham then. A
terrible fear had assailed us  Virginia's mind
was unhinged by trouble ! But when Dr.
Langham arrived, he comforted us a little on
this point.

*' She has had a shock," he said decidedly ;
very possibly a series of shocks, for she is
worn almost to a skeleton, and it has brought
on this attack of the nerves. From her appearance
I should judge that she has not touched
food for hours. We must be very careful," he
continued by-and-by ; " indeed, I may say
there is urgent need of care. The brain is a
very delicate piece of machinery at present ;
she is as much in possession of her reason as
you or I, but the brain is torpid. These
nervous disorders are very misleading to non-professional

people  In extreme cases they
certainly approximate to insanity. Her mind is
over-strained  unhinged, if you prefer the word.
A little more, and I would not answer for the
consequences."

Dr. Langham was right ; he was a clever
man, and we soon realized the truth of his
words. For some days Virginia lay in this
strange torpid state ; she was perfectly tractable,
and would take food from our hands like
a child ; but she did not seem to recognise us 
at least, she never spoke to us  only, when my
father kissed her, she would turn aside, and lie
with her face to the wall, moaning in a sort of
heart-broken way.

*' You must give Nature time," Dr. Langham
would say ; '* every power of mind and body is
exhausted at present. By-and-by, when she
can speak, she will explain everything." And
aoain he was riorht.

o o

About a fortnight passed, when one day I
noticed a change in her. Dr. Langham noticed
it too. *' She is coming round," was all he said ;
'this restlessness is a good sign. Get her to
speak, it will relieve her."

But there was no need for any effort on my
part. Dr. Langham had hardly left the room
before I heard Virginia's voice calling me.

*' He is wise  very wise," she said feebly.

*' Yes, let me talk, Cathy ; let me get rid of all
that is oppressing me "  here she put her hands
on her breast, as though a weight were there.
I lay down beside her on the bed, and she
crept nearer, till her face was against my
shoulder  and then the whole miserable story
came out. It was well my father was not there ;
no man could have controlled himself and
listened quietly. Long before she had finished,
my tears had dried up in a blaze of womanly
anger  that he should dare to treat a Leigh
so!

I can only touch briefly on that story. If
Paul Lyndhurst had ever loved Virginia  and
there was grave suspicion for this doubt  his
love did not survive the honeymoon. Before
many weeks of their ill-starred union had
elapsed, he had thrown off his disguise and
shown himself in his true colours. The first
quarrel had been about her money : he chose
to consider himself injured by the smallness of
her fortune ; her father's threat of disinheriting
her in my favour made him savage. '' If you
had played your cards better we should not
have landed ourselves in this hole," he said to
her angrily. It was in vain poor Virginia protested
that it was no fault of hers ; that to
please him, and him only, she had consented to
the secret marriage. He only flung away from

VOL. I. 10

her with a covert sneer at the easiness with
which he had won her.

Oh, he was a bad man, this Paul Lyndhurst,
a cold, black-hearted villain. Think of the
misery of a pure-minded, delicately-nurtured
woman, carefully sheltered from all knowledge
of evil, suddenly finding herself tied for life to a
man without a shred of honour, without principles,
without religion, and, lastly, without love
for herself.

Alas ! there were darker shades in Paul
Lyndhurst's character, which she found out by-and-by
: an inveterate gambler, he soon squandered
half her little fortune ; and to complete
her disgust, she soon discovered he drank
deeply. Poor unhappy Virginia ! nothing but
her pride, and her despair of her father's forgiveness,
prevented her from leaving him and
returning home; and by-and-by another reason
kept her. After the birth of her boy her husband
treated her better, but this peaceful state
of things did not last long. After a time his
cruel moroseness returned ; something had gone
Wrong with him  his work suffered, and, as usual,
he wreaked his ill-temper on his wife. Virginia
had been long in recovering from her confinement
; before she had regained her strength
they left St. Croix, where her boy was born, for
Havre, and here she had a second illness.

On her recovery she saw a change for the
worse in Paul. He had always been uncertain
in his temper, but now his moods were savage ;
he seemed as though he hated her, and was
determined to embitter her existence. There
were cruel scenes, and Virginia, weak and
broken-spirited by daily insults and ill-treatment,
conceived at last a perfect terror of her
husband. The very sound of his voice or his
footstep threw her into a state of nervousness
that was almost indescribable. One night 
but I will spare you the details, Olga  Virginia,
almost wild with terror and shame, rushed out
of the house like some hunted thing, and wandered
up and down the dark streets, with only
one thought, to hide herself where Paul could
never find her again. By some strange fortune
she found herself presently on the quay. Suddenly
it occurred to her that at this hour the
boat would be starting for Southampton. Like
one in a nightmare she took out her purse.
She had sufficient money, so she paid her fare,
muttered something about her luggage being
too late, and, going down to the cabin, threw
herself upon a vacant berth.'

I could keep silence no longer,

But her child, AuntCatherine?  herlittleboy.'*'

Aunt Catherine shook her head. She looked
at me almost imploringly.

10  2

Do you not understand, Olga ? She was
not herself  my poor Virginia ! The cruel pain
had blotted out her memory.'

Do you mean she had forgotten him ?'
Aunt Catherine bowed her head solemnly.

Don't, Olga  don't speak yet. Did I not
say you must not blame her ? I know what you
are thinking, " Can a woman forget her sucking-child,
that she should not have compassion on
the son of her womb ?" But that such things
can be we are also told In the same text ; but
let me repeat her own words :

" I knew nothing  I thought of nothing,
but to escape Paul. My brain was on fire.
Perhaps I was mad. God grant it, but I fear
I was not ! Only I had forgotten everything
In my unreasoning terror. In the darkness of
night, just before dawn, my memory returned.
I heard the groaning of the paddle-wheels and
the long wash of the waves. A child In the
next berth woke up crying. The sound went
through me like an electric shock. My baby !
I had forgotten my baby ! I had left him
asleep in his little cot, with his bonne beside
him, and had come down to Paul, who had been
already cursing at my delay. He had bade me
fetch my bonnet and mantle, for some wild expedition
he had planned. It was my refusal to
accompany him that had brought on the shameful

scene. I thought he meant to kill me, for
he was mad with drink, and I fled out of the
house." '

Poor thing  poor thing ! And she did not
go back to him ?'

No ; her one thought was to take refuge
with us. She kept saying to herself all the remainder
of the way, '* Cathy is kind ; she will
bring me my baby." But when she reached usher
strength was gone ; that night of agony
had done its work.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine !'  and I was crying
bitterly now  ' surely you or the Squire tried
to find her child for her ? It is too dreadful to
think of, that dear baby left with the cruel
man !'

My dear, I could not leave Virginia, and
my father was too old and broken for such a
business. But we put it into the hands of our
solicitor, to gain possession of the child ; and a
trustworthy person was sent over to Havre to
settle matters with Paul Lyndhurst. There
had been an inevitable delay of some weeks.
When the agent arrived he was too late. Two
days before, Paul Lyndhurst, accompanied by
the child and the bonne, had left Havre ; but
no one knew where they were gone.

'' Monsieur had been in a terrible humour
ever since madame had left," the woman of the

house had informed him ; " nothing had given
him satisfaction. When old Lisette had taken the
boy to him he had sworn at her and bade
her keep the brat out of his sight. Lisette was
a bold woman to accompany him, for monsieur
was one who feared neither /e bon Disc or the
devil, but he paid her well, and  well, one does
anything for money. Lisette was a proper
nurse ; she was devoted to Monsieur Bee.
Monsieur Bee was smiling like an angel when
they left the house." And this was all : father
and child had vanished as though the earth had
swallowed them up. In vain we advertised
and spent time and money in the search. My
father and I went again to Rome. France,
Germany, Switzerland were all searched by our
agents ; but nothing could be heard of Paul
Lyndhurst. Once we thought we were on the
right track ; an artist answering to the description
had been found nearly frozen to death on
some Alpine pass ; but on questioning the
monks he proved to be a German.

Olga, you may imagine the rest : the heartsick
suspense and longing, on Virginia's part 
the alternation from hope to despair. One
moment she believed her boy was dead, the
next she cried out that he was alive, and that
Paul had depraved him and made him like
himself. Her boy's future was ruined, and

all through her ! Yes, you may guess the rest :
Virginia's trouble has been the bunsen of my
life. It is a good many years since we relinquished
all hopes of ever finding Basil ; but
the thought that, if he be living, his grandfather's
v/ill has made him master of the Hall
has given us a new incentive for action. A
few weeks ago we received information from
one of our agents that Paul Lyndhurst was
dead. It is to verify this that I am going to
St. Croix ; but I cannot induce Virginia to
accompany me, poor dear ! She will have it
that he may not be dead, and that she is safer
at the Hall.

 The priest who is our real informant of
Paul's death is supposed to be the same who
baptized Basil; anyhow, it was at St. Croix, at
the very St. Sulpice that Virginia mentioned
in her letter, that the child was secretly baptized.
Now you know all, Olga, and I am terribly
weary. I can talk no more.'

HE WAS SO PRETTY, OLGa!'

I now must change these notes to tragic'

Milton.

Aunt Catherine's tired face certainly verified
her words, and I pressed her to go back to the
house and rest.

Perhaps it will be best,' she returned after a
moment's hesitation. * I can see my story has
excited you ; it would be well for us not to
discuss It now. Go home, dear child, and tomorrow
come to me again, and I will tell you
my plans for next week.'

And then we walked together to the Hall
door, and parted without another word. As I
looked back for a moment to wave my adieux,
I saw Mrs. Lyndhurst watching us from her
window ; but she gave no sign of recognition ;
on the contrary, when she saw she had attracted

my notice, she drew down the blind hastily,
and I walked rapidly down the avenue.

The first gong sounded as I entered the
house, so there was no time to lose. I dressed
hurriedly and took my place at the table, and
tried to talk as usual ; but my manner must
have been strange, for I saw Kitty look at me
inquisitively once or twice ; she was as sharp asa
needle, and was very quick to detect the least
thing amiss. When we went back in the
drawing-room she followed me under the
pretext of showing me her work ; she was
smocking a little frock for Girlie-ga.

Is there anything the matter, Olga T she
whispered. ' I hope there is nothing wrong at
the Hall !'

What should be wrong ?' I answered
shortly, for this sisterly espionage annoyed
me.

I don't knows ; only your eyes look as though
you have been crying.'

Nonsense !'  still more abruptly ; * you are
always fancying things, Kitty. Mrs. Lynd-
hurst is not very well ; but that is nothing new.
I sat with Aunt Catherine in the garden, and
we had a good long talk. Jasper was lovely.
He spread out his tail just to attract our
attention, and Beryl kept pecking at Aunt
Catherine's gown, to remind her of the sweet

cake she had promised her. ' What beautiful
creatures they are !'

And which day do you start ?' asked Kitty,
not particularly interested in these details.

This was embarrassing. I coloured up, and
answered rather awkwardly :

Aunt Catherine did not tell me. I am to
know tomorrow. She was tired, and I did not
stop so very long.'

Only two hours,' was the somewhat sarcastic
rejoinder, and then Kitty carried away her work.

I had not deceived her in the least. In her
own mind she was quite sure that something
had happened. It was trying to have such a
tell-tale face, and really that habit of blushing
over every trifle was extremely ridiculous. I
was thankful that Jem was not there to add to
my embarrassment. Everything was tiresome
that evening. Hubert, as usual, requested
some music, and as Kitty was busy, I was
obliged to remain at the piano for the next
hour to accompany Mr. Cunningham's flute.
The pieces were long and difficult, and I played
worse than usual. To add to my vexations,
Mr. Cunningham begged my pardon at every
mistake, and entreated me to go over the erring
passage again.

No one is listening,' he observed ; 'and we
may as well get the thing perfect. Let us try

that page again, Miss Leigh. One, two,
three

The mild 'tout, tout' of the flute recommenced.
Mr. Cunningham's head wagged contentedly
over his beloved instrument. Crash went the
pedal. I was fast losing patience and temper
under the ordeal, when Harry interposed. He
had been watching us both for some time, though
he had only been pretending to tease Rollo.
At the next break-down he came to my rescue :

Why don't you shut up that beastly noise,
Cunningham T he said quite crossly. ' Don't
you see Miss Leigh is tired out ? You ought not
to trespass on her good-nature. Here you
have been a good hour blowing on that confounded
flute, and no one has a chance of
speaking a word !'

I am afraid Harry was very rude ; but we
were none of us too polite to Mr. Cunningham.
I do hate a rich, lumpish young man.

Mr. Cunningham unscrewed his flute. He
was affronted, and no wonder, by Harry's uncivil
remarks.

You have no soul for music, Vivian,' he
returned stiffly. * People who cannot play
themselves, and know absolutely nothing of
music, generally set themselves up for critics.
Thank you, Miss Leigh ; you played that last
passage charmingly. I like a staccato movement,'

but 1 would not listen to his heavy encomiums
any longer. I gave Harry a grateful
smile and slipped away to my room.

I am afraid to say how many hours it was
before I slept that night. Mrs. Lyndhurst's
sad story haunted me. I went over it point by
point, and again my tears flowed as I thought
of the miserable mother who had lost her child
so strangely. My heart ached for her, and yet
my sympathy was not unmixed with blame.
How could she have done it ?' that is what I
kept saying to myself over and over again. It
was right for her to leave that wicked husband.
No one could blame her for that, if she had only
taken her baby with her ; but to forget her own
child  and yet she was not mad  to leave that
boy in his father's power ! Oh, how could she,
how could she? that was always the summing-up.
No ; I could not understand it. The utter
horror of it all baffled me. It is almost impossible
for youth, witty its healthy, natural
views of life, to comprehend the workings of a
morbid temperament, dominated by a subtle
and cruel power. The complex mysteries of
human nature are not to be unriddled by the
young. Such a case as Mrs. Lyndhurst's
needed the wide comprehension of a psychological
student  wise in the science that is most
conversant with the phenomena of the mind.



If I had been older, the difficulty would have
been easier of solution, for no thoughtful person
who has lived long in this world will deny the
singular contradictions and surprises of human
nature. The man, the woman, acts in a diametrically
different way to what we expected ; strange
things are done on sudden emergencies  there
is utter collapse of the reasoning powers. Can
human nature betray itself after this fashion ?
Look at Judas, at Peter, at a hundred examples
of failures,' would be the answer of the psychologist
; ' " Judge not " is the command of the
All-knowing and All-merciful.' When I went
to sleep that night I felt I loved Mrs. Lynd-
hurst less ; but none the less I pitied her
sincerely. When the morning came I was still
in the same mind, only 1 was determined Aunt
Catherine should never know the change in my
feelings. I went up to the Hall in the afternoon.
Aunt Catherine was writing letters In
the library. She received me with her usual
kindness, and began at once talking about her
plans. It was Saturday, and we were to start
the following Wednesday. We were to take
an early train to town, lunch at an hotel, and
go down by the boat-train to Southampton ; the
boat would not start until midnight. There
was a little more talk about arrangements, a
few questions about luggage, and so on ; and

then Aunt Catherine turned again to her davenport.


These letters must go by the afternoon post,'
she said quietly. ' Will you go up to Virginia
now, Olga ? and we will meet again at tea-time ;'
and as I seemed a little taken aback at this proposition,
she continued : ' Virginia wishes to see
you. She knows we were talking yesterday ;
she made me promise to send you up to her.'

Could anything be more embarrassing ? But
I had no excuse ready; Hubert and Kitty were
paying parochial visits  no one at home wanted
me  so I was obliged reluctantly to leave Aunt
Catherine's comfortable presence, and go in
search of Mrs. Lyndhurst. On my way upstairs
I encountered Marsden. I thought she
looked at me a little oddly as she drew back tolet
me pass.

Mrs. Lyndhurst is in her sitting-room, I
believe ?' I asked, by way of saying something,
for J knew quite well where I should find
her.

Yes, ma'am ; but. Miss Olga,' addressing
me rather hesitatingly, ' my mistress is very
poorly this afternoon. She seems low and
nervous. It is cheerfulness she wants, not any
sort of sad talk  I mean, you will be careful
with her. Miss Olga ?'

I never knew Marsden strange in her manner

before ; her round, good-natured face looked
quite prim and solemn. Was it possible that
she was in her lady's confidence ? She was
an old servant, and a very faithful one, but
somehow I hoped Marsden did not know about
little Basil.

Mrs. Lyndhurst was in her usual place. I
am afraid as I greeted her my manner was a
little constrained, for she looked in my face
very searchingly as she held my hand. After
a moment she dropped it, but she did not ask
me to sit down, or question me in her usual
pleasant way.

Aunt Catherine told me you wanted to seeme,
Mrs. Lyndhurst,' I began rather awkwardly.


Yes,' she returned sadly ; ' I wanted to see
for myself. " When she comes into the room I
shall know," that is what I said. You are not a
good actor, my dear  has anyone told you that
before ? I dare say Jem has. Your face tells
everything in a moment. You were sorry that
I sent for you; you have no wish to see me 
that is all written very legibly, Olga.'

Please don't, Mrs. Lyndhurst.'

Is it painful for you to know that ? Young
people are seldom hypocrites ; they are too
eager; their impatience betrays them. It is
better for you to be true, Olga, even though you

do condemn me. What is it ? I said to
Catherine, '' Do not tell the child  do not,
do not." It is the young who are the most
pitiless of our judges. They make no allowances
; with them black is black and white
white  there are no medium shades, no mercy,
no extenuation. You have done wrong ; you
must suffer for it. Is it not Draco whose laws
were written in blood ? Well, the young are
Draco-like.'

I was nearly crying by this time. Why
would she say such dreadful things? and how
was I to answer her ? It was cruel of Aunt
Catherine to expose me to such an ordeal !

I can read the question in your eyes, Olga,'
she went on. ' You have pretty eyes, my
dear, very soft and gray ; but they have a
terrible way of asking questions. *' How had
you the heart to do it, you unnatural mother ?''
that is what they say.'

Oh, hush, please, Mrs. Lyndhurst !'

My dear, I cannot hush ; there is a time for
everything  Solomon said that, did he not ? 
and my time has come for speaking. '' How
could you do it ?" Olga, that is the question I
have asked myself for twenty-five years, and I
have not found the answer yet.'

It was terrible to hear her ; her voice was
thin and strained, and there was a pinched look

about her face ; but she took no notice of my
entreaties to her to spare herself and me.

If I have sinned, I have had my punishment.
Think of a punishment lasting five-and-twenty
years !  five-and-twenty years !'
Can I ever forget the dreary tone in which
she repeated these words } * It is more than
your whole lifetime, Olga.'

I felt a curious revulsion of pity as she
spoke. My youthful severity was not proof
against such misery : without asking myself
again how such things could be ; I threw my
arms round Mrs. Lyndhurst, and begged her
not to talk so sadly.

Indeed I will not blame you !' I said
earnestly, and I fully meant what I said. ' It is
not easy for me to understand. I am so young,
you see, and so happy, and I have never been
tried ; but, indeed, I will not be hard. Only
you must not talk like this.'

For there was a wildness in her manner that
frightened me, for it brought back the scene in
the Lady's Walk.

My caress soothed her ; she was one who
depended on sympathy. The rigid muscles
relaxed ; a softer look came into her eyes.
She stroked my hand without speaking for a
few minutes, and then she said more quiet :

Yes, I am to be pitied. God only knows

VOL. I. I I

what I have suffered all these years ! Oh, he
was sb pretty, Olga  my baby ! He had such
dear little hands and feet, and such a cooing
voice. Somehow I always think of him still as
my baby, and yet he is a full-grown man.'

I was silent. It would not hurt her to talk
in this quiet fashion ; perhaps it might be a
relief. It certainly pained me to hear her; but
what of that ?  were we not told to bear one
another's burdens ?

I have always dreamt of him,' she went on,
Sometimes the dreams were happy, but at
other times they were terrible  terrible ! They
were never quite the same. I used to dream of
him as a little child, and then as a school-boy.
Once he was showing me his prizes. I was
opening one book after another. " Basil
Theodore Lyndhurst " was written in everyone.
I called him Theodore after my father 
the gift of God. I used to say it over to
myself sometimes. It was so true  my baby
was the gift of God !'

I would not interrupt her by a word, and she
went on softly, as though talking to herself.

Once he had some childish ailment ; he was
feverish and suffering, and I remember how
frightened I was. *' If my baby die, I shall
die too," I said to Lizette. She was a good
old creature. She was rocking the old-fashioned

Flemish cradle as I spoke, and she looked up
and shook her head at me. " Le bon Dieu
will not take the little angel," she said solemnly.
*' He knows, and the Blessed Mary knows, that
madame has trouble enough. It is only our
Lady of Sorrows who has her heart pierced
through and through with pain. Madame will
not have to suffer. She is young and feeble, and
le bon Dieu knows that." Poor old Lizette !
she was very good to me. But, Olga, she little
knew, if I had lost my baby then I should have
wept like other mothers, and have been comforted.
I should not have wept tears of blood
all these years.'

God has watched over him, dear Mrs.
Lyndhurst.'

Ah ! so Catherine says. That is how she
comforts me. If it were not for that thought
I must have lost my reason. Now and then
all hope fails me, and I dream that he is dead.
When I wake it seems to me that I must
search the world over, only to find his
grave.'

Poor, poor Mrs. Lyndhurst 1'

'But that is not my worst fear'  and here
she shuddered  'there are times when far more
terrible thoughts assail me. What if he should
have become like his father ? Catherine has
told you about my husband. Do you think a

II  2

man like Paul would be a fit guardian for an
innocent child ?'

He had Lizette,' I interposed, eager to give
a crumb of comfort ; for she had touched now
on the very point that troubled me.

Yes ; but he would not require a nurse
long ; Lizette would be dismissed, and then how
would it fare v/ith my boy  no mother to counteract
his father's teaching ? What if he should
have grown up a freethinker ? What if he should
have learned to scoff at religion, at women, at
everything  like Paul ? Could he touch pitch
and not be defiled ? Could he live for years
with that godless, bad-hearted man, and not be
utterly depraved ? Oh, if this be the case, 1
pray I pray most solemnly that I may never
see my son's face in this life.'

Her voice had grown more intense, more
tragically earnest. A cold shiver ran through
me at her words. This awful probability had
already crossed my mind. If it were true, oh,
how much better it would be to stumble on
some foreign tombstone, some wooden cross,
in a far-off cemetery, and read the name of
Basil Theodore Lyndhurst engraved there !
If I could only find some word to comfort her !
And then I remembered the beautiful story of
Monica and St. Augustine : the reckless prodigal
feeding on husks ; the weeping, praying

mother ; the consolatory speech, so strangely
prophetic, spoken by a holy man  ' The child of
so many prayers and tears cannot be lost.'
Mrs. Lyndhurst kissed me when I had finished
the simple story. If she had heard it before she
did not say so, but a faint smile came to her face.

It may be so  God grant it!  and my prayers
may have been an invisible shield to Basil. I
will try to think so, and then my pain will be
less.'

Yes ; and Aunt Catherine hopes that she
may hear some news of him at St. Croix.*

The news will be very vague, I fear she
returned sadly. ' Pere Lefevre, the priest who
baptized my little Basil, has only lately returned
to St. Genette. You know St. Croix is only
the suburb. He is again attached to the parish
church, St. Sulpice. We have heard a rumour
that he has been attending the death-bed of an
English artist. The description tallies with that
of my husband.'

Is that all ?' for I thought at least that some
clue had been discovered of Basil.

That is all at present ; it is for Catherine to
find out all she can from Pere Lefevre. If it be
not under the seal of confession he will tell us
what he knows. These priests have kind hearts.
If we could only find old Lizette !  but she must
be lone dead.'

Was she very old ?'

Perhaps not. It is difficult to judge of the
age of these peasants. Their hard work makes
them look older than they really are. She
might have been fifty.'

That would make her seventy-five now.'

Yes, if she be living, but I doubt it. There
is nothing but doubt and regret all round. Even
if I find him, even if Catherine is successful,
and one day I shall hear Basil is alive and
is coming home, do you think even such
blessed news as that can atone for the past?
Think what 1 have lost, never to see him in
his childhood, his boyhood, his early manhood,
to have some strange bearded man suddenly
come to me and say, " You are my mother ; I
am Basil, your son. Where is my grandfather's
property that belongs to me ? Where are my
goods that I ought to have enjoyed all these
years ?' How am I to recognise him whom
I saw last as a baby ?'

Yes, yes, I see what you mean ; it is very
hard for you.'

Will he be like Paul, and frighten me with
his father's likeness ? Will he love the stranger
who calls herself his mother ? Oh, they talk
of nature, of instinct, but instinct is sometimes
blind. I may say to him, " Come, embrace me,
my son ;" and he may answer coldly, " How am

I to feel you are my mother ?  affection in a man
cannot be forced. We have never been anything
to each other ; the whole world has divided
us. How am I know my English mother from
any other woman ?" '

Is this how you have tortured yourself all
these years, Mrs. Lyndhurst ?'

Yes, Olga. Ask Catherine, for she has been
my guardian angel ; ask my good faithful
Marsden how I have tried them. There were
times when, like Cain, my punishment was more
than I could bear  then it was that Catherine
was a tower of strength to me. " You have
still a sister," that is what she would say tome.
I could not have borne my life without
Catherine.'

Just then Marsden interrupted us. She had
a tea-tray in her hand. As she set it down she
looked at her mistress's agitated countenance
with disapproving eyes.

You have talked too much, ma'am she said,
with a solemn shake of her head. ' I warned
Miss Olga; but I see it has been no use. Now
you will have one of your bad headaches.'

'It was not my fault, Marsden,' I pleaded;
for the good creature seemed greatly disturbed.

No, Mary, you must not scold the child.
I was obliged to talk, and I think she has done
me good. Go down now, my dear, and leave

me with Marsden. We quite understand each
other, and she knows she may scold me as
much as she likes ;' and she smiled up in
Marsden's face, but the faithful soul was hardly
mollified. She saw signs of suffering in her
mistress's drawn face and weary eyes, and was
anxious for my departure.

Aunt Catherine was awaiting me in the
drawing-room. She looked at me scrutinizingly
as I sat down beside her.

Well, Olga, can you forgive Virginia now ?'
I forget what my answer was, but I know it
satisfied Aunt Catherine, for she took my hand
and said soothingly :

Don't cry, dear ; I am afraid you have had
a painful scene with my poor sister ; but it was
better for you to see for yourself  now you know
what my life has been.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, how could you have
borne it all these years ?'

That I can hardly tell you. We all have
our work in life  Virginia is my work.*

But it must have been so depressing.'
I would not allow it to depress me. I had
many duties  the care of our property, our poor,
the search for Basil as our rightful heir, the old
name to keep up in the county. Then I had
my pleasures, my books and garden, and '  here

she looked at me very sweetly  ' the affection
of my adopted daughter.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, am I indeed a comfort
to you ?'

Her answer took me by surprise, for she was
rarely demonstrative, and seldom expressed her
feelings.

Sometimes I think you are my greatest
comfort. You are a great deal to me, Olga ;
you always have been. Now drink your tea,
my dear, and let us talk of something else.'

A FAIRY GODMOTHER AND A PRINCE.

I give you my word I am heart-whole.'

Red Gauntlet.

If we cannot be better friends, do not at least let us entertain
harder or worse thoughts of each other than we have now.'

Wordsworth.

Aunt Catherine kept me with her a long time.
She saw that I was much upset, and she wished
to change the current of my thoughts, and as I
still seemed low-spirited and unlike my usual
cheerful self, she took me up to her room under
the pretext of showing me a new travelling rug
that she had just bought. After which she
unlocked her wardrobe and brought out her
jewel casket.

I have never shown you my trinkets, Olga
she said quietly, ' and I know girls love to see
pretty things. These all belong to me. Virginia's
are at our bankers'. She has never
worn a single article of jewellery these five-and-twenty

years, with the exception of one or two
diamond rings ; and as her ornaments are much
handsomer than mine, it was hardly safe to keep
them in the house.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, what lovely things !' I
exclaimed in ecstasy, as she opened one case
after another, and showed me their glittering
contents. ' I think I have seen that ruby
pendant before ; you wore it when you went to
the Collingwoods'  that night I helped you
dress, and you wore your black satin. I know
Kitty told me how well you looked  the best
dressed woman in the room.'

What a distinction !' she returned, smiling at
my enthusiasm, but I knew she liked the little
compliment. ' Well, Olga, you seem entranced
with my treasures. I suppose you think me
enviable to be the owner of all those fine things .''

I am afraid I did think so.

They give me very little pleasure,' she went
on, without waiting for my answer. ' I suppose
if Basil be living these will go one day to his
wife. That is why Virginia hoards hers so
jealously. You see they are chiefly old heirlooms.
They have been in our family for years
and years. Do you see that enamel pendant
set round with pearls  see how discoloured the
pearls are with age  they say that belonged to
the Lady Gwendoline, and that Ralph of the

Iron Heart gave it to her. No one has worn it
since  it would have been considered unlucky ;
but they unclasped it from her neck as she lay
in her coffin. Think of the contrast, a love-token
reposing on the shrivelled neck of an
aged woman ! If it were not for the knowledge
that love is eternal, and that the heart cannot
grow old, one would disbelieve the reality of
such things.'

Lady Gwendoline's story is so terribly sad.'

It is not sadder than many other women's
stories,' she answered, and her tone was a little
peculiar. * Not so sad as Virginia's, for example.
If Gwendoline had accepted her fate,
and had not bewailed over her misery until her
poor brain was crazed, she would have led a
more peaceful existence, dolni her daily work
with patience until death called her to rejoin her
lover. Poor soul, the truth was revealed to herat
last ! Do you remember her dying words :
Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy
Cometh in the morning " ?"

Aunt Catherine's manner had orrown a little

o

solemn.

There are thousands of unspoken and unwritten
stories  some of them as sad as poor
Gwendoline's. Love comes to most women,
but it does not always bring happiness with it.
Some hide their pain like the famous Spartan

boy of old hid his fox. They keep their own
secret unflinchingly to the end ; others take
it meekly as their appointed cross. " What I
do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know
hereafter "  I would write those words on many
a single woman's grave.'

Aunt Catherine,' I began timidly, but she
stopped me by showing me another trinket.

The others are heirlooms, as I told you,
Olga ; but my father gave me this, and I have
always meant it for you  don't blush so, child.
I suppose I may give you a trinket if 1 like,
and I know you have so few pretty things.'

This was the truth, for my mother had been
a poor vicar's daughter, and her few simple
ornaments had been given her by her husband.
Only a bracelet and a ring or two of no particular
value had come into my possession.

But, Aunt Catherine, this is far, far too
beautiful for me !' I gasped.

Why so ?' pretending to misunderstand me ;
it will look very well on your round, whitethroat,
and it is so simple and girlish.'

It is perfectly exquisite,' I stammered, and
indeed it was very unique and uncommon. It
was a necklace formed of a single row of gems
all of them different  set very lightly. Some
of the stones were costly, others less so, and
the effect was extremely good.

Do you like it, Olga ? I am so glad. I
have always meant it for you. Now help me
to clear up all this finery. If there ever be
such a person, Basil's wife will have ample
choice, will she not ? for all these must go by
right to her. There, let me lock them up safely ;
and now you must run home, or Virginia will
be wondering what has become of me.'

I carried off my treasure and showed it
proudly to Hubert, who was sitting alone in
the drawing-room. He examined it curiously,
and then looked at me with rather an odd
expression.

'Do you admire it, Hubert? is it not kind
of Aunt Catherine to give it to me ?'

It is very good of her. I think it extremely
handsome,' he returned in his precise way.
'You are a lucky girl, Olga. There is no
doubt at all that Miss Seton is much attached
to you.'

That is nothing new,' I replied pertly, for I
thought his manner rather tiresome.

But it is more evident now. Jem was only
saying something of the sort the last evening he
was at home. You see neither Mrs. Lyndhurst
nor Miss Seton is young, and they have no

heir. So, as Jem says ' but I was not going

to hear what Jem did say, and I took away my
necklace rather crossly, for it annoyed me to

see Hubert dangling it on his fingers, and peering
at it through his spectacles while he talked
such nonsense.

I am quite sure Aunt Catherine will never
leave me a penny of her money, if that is what
you mean,' I observed in a vexed voice ; ' and
what is more, I do not want it ; and I cannot
bear you and Jem to say such things  it is
dreadfully mercenary, and '

What a silly child you are !' he replied
good-humouredly ; ' but there, Jem and I will
keep our thoughts to ourselves if they annoy
you. I hope you will show Kitty your necklace.'


And then I marched oft with a good deal of
dignity. How tiresome of Hubert and Jem to
think of such nonsense ! But of course they
did not know of Basil's existence, so perhaps
they were not so much to be blamed, after all.
I was doubly anxious now for poor Mrs. Lynd-
hurst to find her son, if only to prevent people
thinking of such ridiculous things.

I went up to the nursery to find Kitty ; on
Saturday evenings she was always up there for
an hour helping nurse. Nurse was busy in the
inner room, and Kitty was sitting by the window
putting in clean tuckers in the children's Sunday
frocks. The twins had just been saying their
prayers ; they were standing by their mother in

SEARCH FOR BASIL LYSDHURST

their little blue dressing-gowns, looking fresh
and fair from their ablutions.

May we stay a little, mother ?' exclaimed
Jessie eagerly, as she perceived me.

Auntie will soon be going away,' observed
Mab as a conclusive argument-and

then they both climbed up in my lap
and pleaded for a stores

It must be a Sunday story am afraid,
finished Jessie, *' because we have just said our
prayers and hymn, and mother would not like
faire-stories after that.*

No, daring, you are quite right returned
Kitty. ' But. indeed, you must not keep them,
Olga : it is quite time for them to be in bed.*

Let me show them this first,' I suggested,
opening the case. And then there was an exclamation
from mother and daughters,

WTiat a beauty you will look in it, auntie !'
from Jessie,

Auntie is quite a beauty without that,* contradicted
Mab  oh, the lovely innocence of
childhood I  * but she will look ever so much
nicer in it  quite a grand lady.'

Let me see it, children dear. Aunt Olga
rr.er.: to show it to me.' And Kitty held it in
her hand admiringly. ' Yes. it is very handsome
: it will just suit you, Olga. Miss Seton
is extremely generous.'

But though she said no more, I could read
her thought : * The ladies have no heir, and
they are fond of Olga !' Good gracious, how
I longed to shout ' Basil Theodore Lyndhurst '
into her pretty little ear !

The little girls left us reluctantly after this,
and then Wilfred came in to say his prayers.
I always liked to watch Kitty with her children.
Her tired face  and how very, very tired she
always looked now !  had a soft, motherly expression
on it.

Mother, why do you always stroke my
head when I say my prayers ?' Wilfred asked
suddenly. * Is it to keep time with the words ?
I think I am too sleepy to say my hymn ;
please let me off.'

I will say it for you, Willie.'

And as the little fellow nestled up against
her, she sang it in a low, crooning voice that
was as good as a lullaby. Nurse carried him
off half-asleep after this, and Kitty turned to
her work again.

Do let me help you,' I pleaded ; but she
shook her head, smiling.

There is so little to do, and I like doing it,
Olga. I do so love working for my children ;
they will not always be little ; when they are
grown up they will not need me. Don't you
think Mab is growing very fast ?'

VOL. I. 12

Yes ; she Is much taller than Jessie.'

She Is quite a little mother to Willie and
baby now, and she Is so nice to her father.
Hubert was only saying so yesterday. If anything
were to happen to me  I mean, If they
lost me  Mab would take care of them
all'

Thank you, Kitty ; I suppose you have
forgotten my existence,' I returned, In a half-affronted
tone. * Mab, indeed !'

Kitty laughed  she could not help It  but
her tone was still melancholy.

I beg your pardon, Olga. I thought, of
course, you would be married. You do not
suppose that I should ever ask you to sacrifice
yourself for my children ? What would Jem
say ?'

Whatever he liked. Kitty, why will you
talk in this doleful fashion ? It Is quite
ridiculous. Mab and Jessie are both so pretty
that they will be sure to marry young. Mab
would just do for Harry, when she grows up,
and then you and Hubert will be Darby and
Joan. V/hat a handsome old couple you will
be!'

Kitty looked at me thoughtfully, as though
she were trying to imagine the picture.

Hubert is always saying things like that.
*when the children leave us," 'when Wilfred

is a man," and so on. It gives me rather a
shiver to hear him.'

Why ? You are very incomprehensible this
evening.'

Oh, I don't know '  folding up her work.
I never think of the future. I cannot imagine
myself old. It takes all my strength to live my
daily life ; I am too tired to look beyond. I
have all I want now  Hubert and the children,
and you and Jem. I have a sort of faith that
as long as my children need me I shall be here.
I know you think me odd, Olga, but my mother
died young, and I suppose that gave me the
notion that perhaps I should never be old either.'
I looked at her anxiously. Kitty was always
prone to low spirits. Was it my fancy, or did
she look a little thinner and more fragile than
usual ? * Want of tone,' Dr. Langham called it.
Well, no one thought much of that.

I hope you do not talk to Hubert in this
way,' I observed, in a scolding tone.

Oh no ; it would only make him unhappy,
poor fellow ! he takes too much care of me
now. I don't know what Hubert would do
without me, Olga.'

I don't know what any of us would without
you,' I returned, with a remorseful kiss or two, for
how often Jem and I had been cross with Kitty !
Now, pray  pray don't talk any more in this

12  2

ghoul-like manner  It is just overwrought
nerves  for you will tire yourself so dreadfully
; and oh ! how angry Hubert would be
if he heard you ! He would send for Dr.
Langham at once, and order you up to bed.'

That is just why I do not tell him,' she
returned ; and a little mischievous sparkle
came to her eyes. ' He is so fussy, dear old
fellow, and makes so much of every little ailment,
so I just keep my bad feelings to
myself, and never tell him what makes me so
cross sometimes.'

'Well, you may tell me instead'  a great
effort of magnanimity on my part, for I did hate
talking about ailments, and presentiments, and
all kinds of doleful things ; and Kitty's remarks
were so often set in the minor key. To
my surprise, she thanked me quite affectionately.

May I, indeed, Olga ? That is so kind and
sisterly of you ! I dare say it is all fancy, and
that talking it over comfortably with you will
do me good. You see, when one has a husband,
one is obliged to think of his feelings ; and
Hubert is very easily depressed. So it will be
nice to tell my troublesome feelings to you.'

Nice for Kitty, perhaps! But I was not the
woman to shirk my word ; and, after all, Kitty
had lots of worries. I thought of Aunt
Catherine's noble example as I went to my

room, and the burthen she had so patiently
borne all these years. Perhaps she had wanted
to be married, and had given up someone she
loved to stay with her afflicted sister. I
thought what a good woman she must be, and
I made a resolution to be more to Kitty, and
to help her as far as possible over the rough
places of life ; and again those touching words
of Amiel came into my mind : ' Oh, be swift
to love  make haste to be kind.'

Kitty's plaintive conversation made me
secretly uneasy, though I would not allow
myself to say so. Most likely the tragical
talk of the afternoon had unhinged me  even
a healthy young person can be nervous. I was
tired and creepy, and did not make allowances
for Kitty's unconscious exaggerations. And
yet I have always noticed that people who talk
much about their feelings  who count their
owen pulsations and regulate their own heart-beats
 are liable to overstep the truth, and to
draw too largely upon their imagination.

I found myself watching Kitty during the
evening. She was certainly a little quieter than
usual. She brought her work to the table where
Hubert was playing backgammon with Harry,
and sat beside him quite contentedly. Once
he told her that she was trying her eyes and
had better go to bed.

You work too hard for us all, little woman,
he said, looking at her tenderly.

I saw Kitty slip her hand into his :

Do let me stop a little longer ; it is so nice

and quiet, and I like being with you.'

Harry was rattling the dice rather noisily,

and did not overhear the little conjugal whisper.

I dice not above seven times a week,' observed
Harry sententiously. ' Mr. Leigh, are
you aware I am quoting Shakespeare ? Actually
those words were written by the immortal
William. Mark the line, pregnant with meaning
: "I dice not more than seven times a
week." '

I congratulate you on your memory, Vivian,'
returned Hubert dryly. ' Whose throw is it ? 
mines Deuce!  ace  come, that's lucky ! Kitty,
my dear, I mean to beat this fellow hollow ; he
has grown too conceited.'

So, after eleven years, Kitty still cared to sit
by Hubert. Matrimony was not such a dull
affair as I thought it, after all. Only, as I took
care to add, if I ever should have a husband he
must be diametrically opposed to Hubert ; no
beard, no spectacles, no fussy humdrum ways !
And he certainly should never call me ' my dear '
I should settle that beforehand with him.
My dear !' Could any two words be more insufferably
patronizing ?

Now it was the very next evening that Harry
behaved in the most tiresome fashion. In fact,
I was so shocked that I cried about it. We
were walking home from church together,
and were just sauntering along in a lazy way,
because the evening was so beautiful, when he
made me turn into a little lane on the pretence
of listening to a nightingale, when all at once I
found, to my dismay, that he was proposing tome
!

If I had not been so angry I must have
laughed, for it was too absurd, and yet the poor
boy was quite in earnest, and, in spite of his
youth, there was a manly dignity about him that
checked any propensity to merriment.

You ought not to be so severe. Miss Leigh,
he said deprecatingly, as I again repeated that
I was excessively annoyed. ' Of course you
have never encouraged me ; but when a fellow
likes a girl, he has a right to tell her so.'

He has no right  none at all,' I replied
hotly, for what would Hubert say to us ? and
how unmercifully Jem would have laughed at
us both ! For though Harry would be tremendously
rich one day  he was an only son, and
Colonel Vivian was at the tip-top of county
society  he was only twenty, and ought to bethinking
of his studies, and not making himself
miserable about a girl a few months younger

than himself. Besides, if I ever married, my
husband must be at least ten years older than
myself !

I hold a different opinion,' he returned,
flushing at my petulance. Poor, dear Harry,
how nice and handsome he looked, and how
fond I was of him ! ' You are very hard on me,
Miss Leigh ; as though I can help loving you ;'
and then he said a great many pretty things,
and would not let me interrupt him until he had
finished, and then he said quite humbly : ' Won't
you give me just a little bit of hope ? I am so fond
of you, that even a crumb of comfort would be
something. If I may speak to you again in a
year's time, or two '

But I stopped him decidedly.

'It is no use, I cannot care for you in that
way, Harry. I like you ; you have always
been so nice and kind, and you have given me
Rollo ; but I will not be so wicked as to give
you any hope. We will be friends. Oh yes,
we will always be friends, and I shall be so
interested in all that concerns you.'

I see it is all up with me,' he returned
gloomily ; ' but of course I am not such a cad
as to press a girl. If you ever alter your mind' 
here I shook my head  ' you must just let me
know, for 1 shall never care for anyone else.'
(* Oh, Harry, what a fib !') * I suppose you would

not let me, just for once ' but as I drew myself
up the poor boy blushed and apologized. I
took his hand and held it for a moment ; there
were tears in his eyes, and I was so sorry for him.

No, Harry dear,' I said gravely ; ' how do
I know that in the years to come I may not
like somebody else better, and then I should
feel sorry if 1 had let anyone else kiss me. Nowe
can be friends without that ;' and then, as he
still continued dejected, I talked to him in quite
an elder sisterly way. Harry's sisters were
only school-girls of fourteen and fifteen. I
gave him a great deal of excellent advice, to
which he listened in a most docile manner ; but
I am not sure that it benefited him, for as we
turned our faces homeward he produced a little
packet from his waistcoat pocket, and in a
shamefaced manner tendered it for my acceptance.


It was a pretty little brooch, and must have
cost a good deal ; but I put it back in his hand.

You must keep that for Ada or Laura's
birthday,' I said quietly, and he did not venture
to say another word. When we reached the
hall-door I shook hands again with him  this
time very solemnly. ' You poor boy, I must
forgive you, I suppose, but you must never do
so again,' and I ran upstairs.

I cried a good deal that night, for I was so

sorry to have vexed him ; but as I brushed out
my hair before the glass, I peeped at myself
once or twice rather curiously.

So I have actually refused an offer !' I
thought ; * I wonder if I shall ever have another.
Kitty said she never cared for anyone until she
saw Hubert  that the moment she saw him she
had an odd sort of feeling. I rather like that
idea ; in fairy tales everything is so deliciously
sudden : the prince comes riding up ; he just
throws a glance at the fortunate princess. " I
am he," that is all he says, and he holds out his
hand, and they ride away into fairyland. I
shall never have another chance, I know; but, all
the same, I should like something out of the
common. Jem says I am awfully romantic.
What a goose you are, Olga !" he would say.
Well, I am a goose,' and with this humiliating
confession I scrambled into bed.

LA MAISONNETTE.

Oh, the moorland by the sea, where the purple heather groweth,
And the bracken rears its crozier 'midst the mosses and the
ling :
Where the brown bee crowns its song as it gaily homeward
goeth,
And the wheeling sea bird stooped the white wonder of
its wing.

Oh, the incense-breathing firs ! the great firs that skirt the
moorland,
Shedding perfume all about it, from soft surging plumes of
green,
That with strong protecting arms, leaning inward from the
foreland.
Let the tender, warm sea-azure here and there slip in
between.'

Helen Marion Burnside.

Do you feel better, Olga ?'

No  yes  I don't know, Aunt Catherine,' I
replied, speaking in the smallest of voices, and
struggling up into a sitting posture. I am
afraid I must have looked a miserable object
huddled up in my berth, for Rollo sprang up

and licked my hand ; and, in spite of her pity,
Aunt Catherine could not forbear a smile.

Poor child, I am so sorry you have had such
a wretched time. The captain owns it was a
little fresh, but I was too good a sailor to mind
it. Now, Olga, you must drink this cup of tea
and try to join me on deck. We are just nearing
the quay, and it is such a lovely morning.'

I will try,' I replied languidly ; ' but please
do not wait for me.'

For in my present mood it almost aggravated
me to see Aunt Catherine so well and brisk ;
she looked as trim and comfortable as though
she had slept in her bed at home  not a hair
awry, and quite a fresh colour in her face.
Indeed, as she took care to inform me, she had
slept soundly the first part of the night, and
then, finding the cabin close and unbearable,
had gone up on deck to watch the daybreak.

A little fresh, that was what they called it!
Never had I passed such a night in my life !
It had seemed interminable, lying there in misery
and discomfort, listening to the labouring engines
and the wash of the waves, and seeing
nothing but the swinging lamps and the rocking
walls of the cabin. Now and then it appeared
to me as though the floor were merged into the
ceiling. Dim figures seemed to reel through
the distant door. Now we seemed to sink with

swing-like motion into some deep trough of the
waves, and then to rise with an awful regularity
and precision. How I longed for my dear little
room at Fircroft, for Kitty, for Jem  even
Hubert would have been a comfort  to be anywhere
out of this suffocating place, which to my
giddy, confused senses seemed full of white,
cadaverous faces, and whispering voices grotesque
with misery !

It was good of Aunt Catherine to bring me
that cup of tea ; but in spite of its restorative
effects I still felt so faint that it was with
difficulty that I could drag myself from my
berth ; and long before I had put the finishing
touches to my toilet, the boat stopped, and we
could hear the rush of footsteps overhead.

Olga, my dear child, what a time you are !'
and Aunt Catherine looked at my pale face with
concern. * The luggage is being taken to the
Custom House, and we must go ashore at once.
Don't look so miserable ; the fresh air will do
you a world of good, and you will soon feel all
right again.'

And with these cheering words she handed
me my hat and gloves, and bade me follow heron
deck. The first rush of cool morning air
turned me giddy, and I clutched Aunt
Catherine's arm for support. I was dazzled,
confused by the sunshine and bustle, the crowding

passengers, the sharp volley of speeches.
A strange blending of English and French
voices seemed to fill the air  gendarmes, drivers
of fiacres, and sailors. How strange it all
looked ! What a medley of foreign life ! What
glow and colouring ! Before us were the gray
walls and buildings of St. Genette, the broad
quay planted with plane-trees, the stream of
people and luggage going to the Duane ;
behind us the blue sea, with its tossing, crested
waves sporting in the sunlight. What a bright
scene ! how full of interest to everyone except
to me !

Now, Olga,' observed Aunt Catherine, in the
same brisk voice, ' you shall sit down on that
nice shady seat while I see after our luggage 
you are not fit for the bustle of a Duane, and
I am perfectly accustomed to manage for myself.
No one will interfere with you, you will
find plenty of amusement, and Rollo will take
care of you ;' and I gladly took her advice.

The giddiness was passing off now, and I
began to feel less miserable ; in a little while I
was looking about me with the keen delight of
an inexperienced traveller. Every minute I
saw something to attract my attention ; now it
was a group of watermen in their blue blouses,
gesticulating and talking with French vivacity ;
then a bonne, in her white cap, with some oddly-dressed

children ; a priest, in shovel hat and
cassock ; a little shrivelled Sister of Mercy, in a
white hood and gray habit. A sudden tinkling
of bells ; a miller's cart slowly rumbles along the
quay ; the driver in his blue blouse cracks his
long whip ; the horses are gay with their blue
sheepskins and bells  under the bright sunshine
everything looks full of colour. Two more
priests, one old and gray, the other young and
solemn-looking, pass me, reading their breviaries,
and an old peasant woman, in a long black cloak,
with a basket of onions and carrots, meets them.
The old priest lifts his hat with a kindly air.
Bon jour, Madame Grenier !' he says, with a
kindly reverence. The toothless old creature
mumbles out something in a shrill voice ; she
has a brown weaken face, and looks a hundred,
at least ; some soldiers with blue trousers and
red shoulder-knots pass, and point her out to
each other ; then they laugh and nudge each
other, and say something about his reverence
and the little mother of the big Pierre. So
these are French soldiers, I say to myself;
these dapper little figures with odd monkey-like
faces, and big pointed moustaches. How they
strut along the quay  these fine fellows  as
though they could conquer the world ! The
younger priest has walked on, still absorbed
in his breviary ; but Madame Grenier talks on

in shrill quavering accents, and the old priest
listens good-humouredly ; she is telling a long
story, but it is not easy to understand her dialect
the name Pierre comes in frequently. Has
she ever been young, this Madame Grenier? It
must be terrible to grow like that ! At this point
in my reflections, Aunt Catherine interrupted me.

I am ready now, Olga,' she said ; ' the luggage
is on the fiacre ; it is rather a long
drive to La Maisonnette, but I see you are
better.' I noticed that she gave the old priest
a searching look as we passed him. * If it
should be Pere Lefevre !' she whispered in my
ear. Another crack of the whip, and we were
off, down a long road that skirted the quay. It
was some time before we lost sight of the sea.
The lean little horses did their work famously,
but presently their speed slackened, as we
entered a long narrow street with shops on
each side. 'We have left St. Genette, Olga,'
explained Aunt Catherine ; ' this is really St.
Croix. You must see St. Genette properly tomorrow;
some of the streets are so quaint. It is
such an interesting place  especially to artists.
This street is comparatively common-place, but
the shops are excellent. Look ! there is the
market, but the stalls are half empty. Do you
see that old woman with the gold earrings ?'

I was thoroughly interested by this time.

J

After a few minutes we turned into a wide road
planted with trees, up and down which some
bonnes and children were strolling. By-and-by
we came to a lahore figure of the Christ hanging
on the cross. How lonely and pathetic it looked
in that wide place ! We passed some large
houses set in gardens after this ; then the road
grew more countrified. We drove down lanes
with cornfields on one side ; strange to say, the
cornfields were also orchards. All at once we
stopped before a big brown gate shaded by a
large sycamore ; a barn was on one side. The
driver pulled a bell that sounded a hoarse loud
peal ; the next moment we heard footsteps, and
a young woman with an oddly-shaped coif
and a droll good-humoured face threw open the
gate with voluble welcome.

Madame and the young demoiselle were
welcome ; they must be much fatigued, and
must refresh themselves at once. She and
Jules would see to the luggage. The horses
would take care of themselves. Would
madame enter the house ?' in a shrill, high-pitched
voice.

We were standing in a wide courtyard.
Before us was a good-sized house, plastered
with yellowish stucco, with great brown shutters
 jealousies, I suppose they call them  to
every window. The sun was blazing now, for

VOL. I. 13

It was mid-day, so Aunt Catherine was glad to
take refuge in the house. The doors all stood
open. Rollo, who had preceded us, stood
wagging his tail in some perplexity.

Out of the way, old fellow. This is the
salon, Olga !' exclaimed Aunt Catherine ; and I
followed her into a pleasant room, very nicely
furnished, and deliciously cool, with one big
window looking on the lawn and courtyard, and
the other on the garden. I opened the blind
and peeped out, and my exclamation brought
Aunt Catherine to my side in a moment.

I had never seen such a garden. It was full

o

of big trees, and resembled a miniature wood.
At the end was a little grove ; a broad
gravel walk led to it. On one side was a tiny
lawn, on the other a confused pattern of oddly-shaped
beds, with paths round them. The
whole garden gave one a delightful Impression
of shady coolness and luxuriant foliage.

Very pleasant In summer, but decidedly
unwholesome In winter,' observed Aunt
Catherine. ' No wonder the place did not
agree with Mrs. Milner. What a pretty room
this is, Olga  is it not? There is Jeanne
carrying in our rugs. I suppose the salle-manger
is opposite. Let us explore. Does It
not seem strange, taking possession of the
whole house in this fashion. Look at Rollo



poking his nose almost everywhere ; I am sure
he enjoys the fun as much as we do.'

The salle-manger was a large bare-looking
room, one end lined with cupboards, and with
an astonishing number of doors. There was a
door into the passage, and a door into a dark,
fusty little kitchen, a glass-door opening on the
courtyard, and another opposite it leading into
the garden. A small window by the fireplace
gave additional light. A hen and some chickens
were clucking on the door-step in anticipation
of a meal, which the white cloth and cups and
saucers seemed to warrant.

Oh, Aunt Catherine, how deliciously cool
this room is ! but it is far too big for comfort.
What a long table just for us two !'

The coffee is ready, and shall be served,'
returned Jeanne, coming in at that moment.
Perhaps madame would dismiss Jules, and
give him his due. She and the demoiselle
must be famished after such a journey. Would
mademoiselle prefer a cup of English tea ?
Madame always took it for her dejeuner.
Strong tea with a slice of lemon would be
refreshing, or cafe au lait.'

I pronounced in favour of a cup of English
tea ; Aunt Catherine chose cafe au lait. More
bustle, and stamping of sabots across the brick
floor, then Jeanne marches in triumphantly,

132

bearing" a large coffee-pot In one hand and a
little brown teapot in the other ; a pile of toast
follows, then eggs, and some slices of curious-looking
meat, a bowl of salad, some plums, a
glass-jug of cold water. Rollo watched Jeanne's
movements attentively. He was a dog of
sagacity, and always knew his friends. Jeanne
was not handsome ; she had a turned-up nose ;
she wore a singular cap ; she talked gibberish ;
still Rollo decided she was a person to whom
he might show respect. In proof of this he sat
up before her solemnly and tendered her a paw
  a signal that he was growing hungry.

Jeanne uttered a faint shriek, and wrapped
her hands in her apron ; she pronounced him
Uni bete enjoyable  he was ill-conditioned,
terrible, a monster to be feared ; regardless of
all these compliments, Rollo still sat and
proffered his paw in the most friendly fashion.

Jeanne giggled and fairly fled to her kitchen,
and we could hear her high-pitched voice out
in the courtyard.

Mrs. Milner says Jeanne is an excellent
servant,' observed Aunt Catherine, as she
poured out my tea ; ' she is a most faithful
creature. I wish you did not look so pale,
Olga, but tea and toast will just suit you. I
did not make a bad breakfast on board, but I
mean to try some of that stuffed veal. You

must lie down and get a nap, while I unpack
and write to Virginia.'

1 was glad to take this advice presently.
There was only one good-sized bedroom, which
I at once decided must be for Aunt Catherine.
The other rooms were rather small and barely
furnished ; an uncarpeted passage led to them.
After a few moments' hesitation, I chose a long,
narrow room next to Aunt Catherine's ; it was
furnished with the utmost simplicity  a little
French bedstead in one corner, a painted washstand
and chest of drawers, with an oval glass
in a black frame hanorinor over it. There was a
door of communication with a still smaller
room ; a chintz curtain hung over it. The floor
was polished, and a little strip of carpet was
beside the bed. The window was wide open :
down below was the shady garden, with the
little grove, looking more like some woodland
glade in its depth of delicious coolness ; it was
so strangely silent, too  only the humming of
bees, as they hovered over the quaint flowerbeds,
broke the stillness, or the occasional click
of Jeanne's sabots across the courtyard. Aunt
Catherine came in and closed the great brown
shutters for me ; then she shook up the snowy
pillow, and left me to my siesta. It was late
in the afternoon when I was awakened by
Rollo laying his big black paw on my arm ; he

looked in my face with a whine, as though remonstrating
with me on my unusual laziness.
Jeanne was standing by me with a little tray
with a cup of coffee and some crisp-looking
crackers on a white-fringed napkin ; she deposited
it on the bed, and then, putting her
hands on her hips, regarded me with a benevolent
grin.

La jeune demoiselle had slept well  bien !
The great dog, Monsieur Rollo  was not that
his name ?  had been contemplating the door for
hours ; he had been triste, inconsolable, without
his mistress. Where was madame ? she lead
one to recruit herself with a walk  she was a
person of energy. She had left word that the
jeune demoiselle  Meess  Meess Olga  oh,
the droll little name!  should repose herself: the
day was long enough for amusement. Would
it be possible to assist mademoiselle ? no 
then she, Jeanne, would return to her devoirs ;
there was water to draw from the well, and she
must fetch eggs and butter from the farm.
Would the young English Meess be afraid to be
left in the house with the big dog, Monsieur
Rollo ?'

I dismissed Jeanne with the assurance that I
should not be afraid, and then jumped up and
unpacked with the utmost despatch, while Rollo
lay with his nose between his paws and watched

me. When I had finished I took my hat and
went out in the passage ; the open window
tempted me, and I stood for some minutes
looking out on the courtyard and barn and the
brown gate shaded by the huge sycamore.
How still and peaceful it looked in the evening
light ! I felt as though 1 were in some enchanted
place ; it was all so strange and undone-like, as
though I were dreaming, and must wake up
presently and find myself back at Fircroft.
Jeanne must have gone to the farm ; I peeped
into the empty kitchen, where only a black
kitten was warming herself beside the closed
stove, and then went out into the garden. 1
directed my steps involuntarily to the little
grove ; there were some wicker chairs and a
table, and a hammock swinging between two
trees ; a little gate led into a kitchen-garden
full of fruit-trees. A sort of curiosity induced
me to snatch the gate and walk down the
narrow, grass grown path ; there seemed a sort
of building at the end, that looked like a stable
or a barn, I could not guess which ; a dilapidated
flight of steps led to the upper story  was
it inhabited ? for there was a white curtain
fluttering at an open window  the next instant
I caught sight of a dark masculine profile, and
turned hastily away. Perhaps, after all, it was
a barn, and that was the farmer himself. I was

intruding  most likely the kitchen garden belonged
to the farm and not to La Maisonnette.
I was glad to close the gate behind me, and to
find myself in our own garden.

I wondered where Aunt Catherine had gone,
and as I heard Jeanne's sabots In the distance, I
determined to go a little way down the lane ;
but as I opened the gate I found her standing
outside ; she had her old brown garden-hat
on.

I was just wishing for )Ou, Olga,' she said
brightly. * I wanted to show you the extensive
domains that belong to our landlord. I have
been talking to him  his name is Monsieur
Perrot, and he lives at the farm close by. He
seems an honest old fellow. That lane leads
right down to the bay ; but I want to show you
the view from the cliff Burst. We may regard
this as our private grounds  so Monsieur
Perrot tells me. No one but his lodger ever
comes here, so we shall be quite undisturbed.'

So saying, she opened a little gate, and we
found ourselves in a cornfield full of apple-trees.
Then we came to a green place with
some beautiful fir-trees, overlooking the lane.
Across the road were the grounds of a chateau,
with a small lake surrounded by trees, and a
boat moored to the bank. The water had a
strange greenish hue, as though from the

filtering of sunshine through leaves ; it had a
solitary, deserted look, as though no human
footstep ever broke the stillness, or trod on the
grassy paths.

That is the Chateau de Clairville,' observed
Aunt Catherine. ' It belongs to the Detains
but they are in Paris at present. Mrs.
Milner told me a sad story about them once.
The eldest son, then a fine boy of eleven or
twelve, was drowned in that very lake. A
schoolfellow upset the boat, and Gaston could
not swim. They say none of the family have
ever looked at the lake since. It is probably
the truth, for the boat seems falling to pieces
through age and disuse. Madame Detains
has taken a dislike to the chateau, and
they live most of the year in Paris.'

It looks like the scene of a tragedy,' I
returned, with a shudder. ' How weird and
uncanny it must look by moonlight. Let us go

and Why, there is actually heather!

What a pretty, wild place !'

'Yes; is it not? This is the cliff; and if
we follow this little winding path, we shall
come to the steps that lead down to the
bathing-house. Is this not curious, Olga 
this mingling of cornfields, orchards, fir-trees,
and heather-covered cliffs ! Now you can seethe
bay  what do you think of that i'

I was silent from sheer admiration of the
beautiful scene before me. Below us lay the
yellow sands, with piles of amber coloured
seaweed, and beyond, the blue waters of the
bay, shimmering in the golden sunlight, and
studded with rocky islets ; across the bay
wooded promontories, and the white gleam of
buildings from the gay little seaport town of
Nanterre ; while to our left were the picturesque
banks that skirted the river Livres  cliffs, sands,
and the red and white sails of numberless boats,
all steeped in the pure radiant light of early
evening.

Aunt Catherine, this is paradise !'
An earthly paradise ; but you are right  it
is very beautiful. The sunsets are wonderful
here ; indeed, the glow of colouring is peculiarly
foreign. I have seen the bay as intensely
blue as the Mediterranean. Look to your
right, Olga : that is the fashionable bathing-place
of St. Croix, and across those cliffs there
is the cemetery and the Hospital de St. Pierre.
We shall pass both on our way to the English
Church. Further on is St. Genette, and those
massive towers belong to St. Dominique 
that is where they kept the English prisoners.
When we cross to Nanterre, we shall have to
start from St. Dominique  it is only twenty
minutes across the bay.'

I listened to Aunt Catherine with interest
and tried to follow her outstretched finger, as
she pointed out one object after another ; but I
could only give a divided attention. My own
senses seemed steeped in beauty. We were on
the farthest point of the cliff ; no one was insight
; the only signs of human life were the
little boats rocking in the sunlight. One could
dimly discern a red or blue cap belonging to
some fisherman. We where seated on the
heather, and the long slow wash of the waves
was the only sound that reached our ears ;
except, once, the distant clanging of a bell on
the cliff.

Are you cold ? Why do you shiver, Olga ?
There is scarcely a breath of air ; it has been
a hot day, so Monsieur Perrot tells me.'

No, I am not cold.'

But in spite of my words another irrepressible
shiver passed through me. I had a strange
indescribable sensation as though something
were going to happen, as though some subtle
spirit of change stood by me to interpret the
future. Why had I come there ? Would it
not have been better for me to have remained
at home ? Something to this effect seemed to
pass through my mind with a strange nervous
accompaniment of dread. I had never experienced
such a feeling before.

Are you sure there is nothing the matter,
Olaf ?'

No ; but I believe I am tired,' and I stood
up and stretched myself a little wearily.

Let us go back to the house, then,' returned
Aunt Catherine kindly. ' Jeanne will have
prepared our supper by this time, and when
you have had it you shall go to bed. Come,
child, come !'

But I followed her unwillingly. Once I
looked back ; the sky was tinged with a rosy
hue ; the bay was transfigured ; the lite fleet
of fishing smacks looked like fairy boats ; the
opposite shore was bathed in the glow of the
setting sun.

I am glad I have come across the seas to
look at this,' I said to myself; and then aloud,
Aunt Catherine, we must always come herein
the evening. I shall christen this lovely spot
Seton Point." '

A Middle-aged ROMANCE.

Thou goes,' she said, ' and ne'er again
Must we two meet in joy or pain.'

Bridal of Triermain.

They part,
Each with a grieved and anxious heart.'

Berkeley.

A NIGHT of sound sleep perfectly restored me.
When we met at breakfast, Aunt Catherine
declared herself to be quite satisfied with my
looks. It was a lovely morning ; the air delight
and buoyant, the spacious salle-manger
looked cool and bare as I entered it. There
was a pleasant flicker of green leaves against
the glass-door that led into the courtyard. A
faint breeze stirred the huge branches of the
sycamore. Rollo lay stretched out on the stone
step watching a hen and her chickens scratching
in the dust. A fragrant smell of coffee came

from the kitchen. A great pile of brown toast
was on the table. Aunt Catherine came in
from the garden with a bunch of roses with the

o

dew still on them.

Have you slept well, my dear ? but I need
not ask, you look as bright as the morning itself.
Now I shall venture to propose a little plan for
the morning. We will take a fiacre and drive
down to St. Genette ; it is too hot to walk all
that distance. After we have looked about usa
little, we will go to St. Sulpice. You will
not mind my leaving you alone for a little while,
Olga, while I call on Monsieur Lefevre ?'

You are going this morning ?' in some
surprise.

Aunt Catherine smiled.

Procrastination was never one of my faults.
What is the use of putting off for tomorrow
the duty that belongs to to-day ? I am too good
a business-woman to cheat my conscience in
that way. I have come all this distance to see
Pere Lefevre, and I do not mean to lose a
moment before I call on him. We must think
of poor Virginia.'

Yes ; of course.'

But I was a little sorry that Aunt Catherine
would not give up one day to pure enjoyment ;
it was such a delicious morning. I should have
liked to have spent it on the sands, or on Seton

Point ; but I would not have told her so for
worlds.

An hour afterwards we were driving towards
St. Genette, and my brief discontent was soon
forgotten at the sight of the beautiful old
town, with Its narrow picturesque streets, and
its quaint houses with their peaked roofs and
overhanging eaves and wide casements, over
which towered the steeple of St. Sulpice. I
felt as though I were transported back to
mediaeval days, as though I had seen those old
streets In some dream of the past. What colouring,
what harmony of tints in the soft grays and
yellows, the dull red roofs, the narrow breadth
of sky above, so deeply, intensely blue, the clear
sunshine ! And then the gay medley of passers-by
 white-capped bonnes, soldiers in red and
blue, sisters of charity in their hoods and gray
and black habits, sombre-looking priests,
peasant women with massive silver earrings
reposing against their brown, shrivelled cheeks,
and little black bead-like eyes roving everywhere.
From end to end of the quaint old
town we drove, and every moment we came
upon some picturesque group, some combination
of effect and colouring to excite our admiration.
Now it was some snow-white pigeons settling on
a red-peaked roof, now a heavy cart with gray
horses ambling along under their gay adornment

of blue sheepskin and bells, then a donkey with
pannier, a dark-eyed girl with gold earrings
walking beside it, a brown-faced baby in a close
cap peeping out of each pannier

All at once we left the narrow streets behind
and crossed a place with sycamores and seats
under them. Some soldiers were drinking and
smoking under the awning of a restaurant.
A band was playing in the distance, some
children were dancing, while their bonnes
chatted and knitted on the benches. A quick
turn, and I uttered an exclamation of delight :
before us was the open sea. The waves were
rolling in upon the shore ; the sun was shining,
there was a great stretch of yellow sands : gay
little cabanes of blue and white striped canvas
seemed dotted about everywhere; oddly dressed
figures emerged from them, and ran with little
ripples of laughter into the sea. The children
were wading knee-deep in the pools ; ladies
were workings gossiping, watching the bathers ;
the band was playing dancing music ; there were
coloured minstrels, conjurers, ah old man with
an organ and a melancholy-eyed monkey. The
old man played a dreary tune, the monkey
jumped and clutched its little red cap. Some
soldiers were watching it. Everywhere life,
movement, children's voices, laughter, and the
yellow sunshine pouring down on the gray old



buildings and rocky island, and on the happy
human groups. I could have stayed there for
hours; but Jules had his orders, and after a few
minutes he had cracked his whip again, and the
lean little horses were carrying us back into the
narrow streets. We were descending a somewhat
steep one. The houses were poorer and more
crowded. In another moment we were at the
door of St. Sulpice.

What a change from the busy streets to the
dark scented stillness within. j\n old peasant
woman was hobbling in before us. She took
some holy water and crossed herself, and looked
at us rebukingly as we passed her.

How vast and mysterious it all looked  the
lamps swinging before the high altar, the stacks
of empty chairs, the side chapels and shrines,
with dark figures kneeling here and there, the
strange, penetrating perfume of incense.

I will leave you now, Olga whispered Aunt
Catherine ; ' there is much that will interest you.
You can go round and look at everything ; no
one will disturb you.'

I felt as though I were in some dream as I
heard the great door close after her. The utter
stillness, the gleam from the different shrines,
seemed to wrap me round with mystery.
Everywhere was repeated the same solemn
story here the Madonna and the calm-eyed

VOL. I. H

Babe, there the Mater Dolores and the Divine
Sufferer on the cross  simple, majestic, uncomplaining
; in all ages a spectacle to n:en and
angels.

I grew weary of wandering about presently,
and seated myself before a little chapel, with an
image of a grave, benevolent St. Joseph, and
the Holy Child beside him. An old fisherman
was kneeling before it ; his gray head was
bowed in his hands. A little farther off was
the old peasant woman who had preceded us,
and a lady with a long black veil. Now and
then some noiseless figure glided from behind
the high altar and knelt down silently. The
hushed fragrant atmosphere seemed full of those
noiseless prayers.

It is good to be here,' I thought ; ' here
thousands of worshippers, rich and poor,
learned and ignorant, have brought their cares
and sorrows, their penitential petitions, their
praises, to the throne of Divine Grace. In
England the churches are empty, swept and
garnished for the Sunday services. No sons
and daughters of toil ever creep into those spotless
edifices on week-days to offer up a prayer,
a thanksgiving for some blessing received. Are
the poor of St. Genette more pious ? Whose
fault is it that our churches are not homes for
our working people ?'

I was so absorbed by these reflections that
Aunt Catherine's return quite startled me. I
had not expected her so soon. She looked pale
and weary, and as soon as we were outside she
said with a sigh :

We shall have to be patient, Olga. I
encountered an unexpected difficulty. Monsieur
Lefevre left St. Croix this morning. He
has been summoned to a brother's death-bed,
and is not expected back for a week or two. I
saw his old housekeeper, but she could give
me no information. Her master was a holy
man, she said, and was always attending the
sick and dying. He never spared himself if
his people needed him. Some of the other
Fathers knew how to save themselves trouble,
but not Pere Lefevre.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, what a disappointment
!'

Yes, it is very trying. Virginia will be so
cast down by the delay. If I thought it would
be any good, I would follow him to Paris ; but
how can one intrude at such a time ? He
will come back, she says, as soon as his
brother is buried ; and I fear we must wait for
that.'

But though Aunt Catherine said no more,
I could see that she was much troubled.

We were tired with our busy morning, so,

142

after dinner, Aunt Catherine proposed that we
should take our books and walk to the little
grove, as I persisted in calling it.

'Jeanne says it is always cool there on the
hottest days ; and she has promised to bring us
some coffee presently. In the evening we can
stroll to your favourite point.'

As I approved of this plan, we were
soon comfortably ensconced, Aunt Catherine in
an old-fashioned armchair, and I in the hammock.
We were both indisposed for conversation
at first  Aunt Catherine had a book, and I
was content to lie in the hammock and listen
to the birds twittering among the leaves over
my head, and think of Jem  it was so pleasant
and peaceful. As I swung to and fro, I could seethe
little grass-grown path I had explored
yesterday, between the apple-trees. Someone
was walking among the cabbages, for I could
catch sight of a blue blouse in the distance. The
sun was blazing on the yellow stucco walls of
the house ; the brown shutters were closed.
Jeanne was going to and fro between the welland
the court-yard  I could hear her shrill voice
speaking to someone ; the black kitten was
chasing a white butterfly across the lawn,
springing up into the air and then suddenly
wheeling round in pursuit of its own tail ; a
great brown bee settled on a rose-bush close

to US.  What a beautiful world this is,' I
thought as I floated off into a day-dream.

Aunt Catherine read steadily all the afternoon,
but I noticed that now and then a sigh
escaped her ; but she did not talk freely until
we had taken our coffee, and were sauntering
towards the cliff. When we had seated ourselves,
and had exhausted our rapturous exclamations
at the beauty of the evening, and of the bay
below us, she said rather suddenly : 

Olga, you do not know how I have set my
heart on finding Basil.'

I had been watching some barefooted boys
with closely-cropped heads and ragged trousers,
who were collecting seaweed on the shore, but
as she spoke, I looked up in some surprise.

I shall be bitterly disappointed if we fail to
discover any traces of him. I hope I am not too
sanguine, but I am hoping great results from
my interview with Pere Lefevre. Surely Paul
Lyndhurst will have spoken of his son on his
death-bed.'

If if he be still alive,' I replied ; but Aunt
Catherine looked a little distressed at my remark.


Who put that doubt in your head, Olga ?
Why should not Basil be alive ? Virginia always
says he was a strong, healthy child. It would bea
cruel disappointment to me as well as to his

mother, if your supposition were true. If Basil
be dead, we have no heir

I was silent, for just then Hubert's foolish
speech came into my head. I felt myself colour
with annoyance. That was the worst of hearing
such speeches, they could not be forgotten. But
Aunt Catherine did not notice my slight embarassment
; she was following out her own line
of thought.

It is so sad that we have no one belonging
to us  no one to take interest in the place, and
to cherish us in our old age. Virginia's son
would have been so dear to me. I should have
been as proud of him as though I had been his
mother. Sometimes I look at Jem  we are both
very fond of him  but he is not a Seton : our
blood does not flow in his veins  he is not one
of us.'

I see what you mean, Aunt Catherine.'

It is our own that we want, our own flesh
and blood. If I could only find Basil, and say to
him, " I am your mother's sister, but you shall belike
my own son ; come home with me, and I
will show you your mother. If you will be
patient and not mind the society of two homely
women, we will teach you the old traditions,
the family histories. You shall know your
ancestors by name, you shall be one of us." This
is what I am always saying to the imaginary

Basil ; and,' with a little smile, ' he always puts
his hand in mine, and says frankly, " I will go
home with you." '

I had never heard Aunt Catherine speak like
this before. There was a yearning sound in
her voice, and a misty look in her gray eyes
that spoke of unfulfilled longing.

If you had only married !' I exclaimed involuntarily'.


She started, and a faint blush came to her
cheek.

You mean, if I had married I might have
had a son of my own  perhaps sons and
daughters, who knows ? That is what one
misses when one grows old. That is why I
think so much of Basil, because I have no one
else belonging to me.'

But, Aunt Catherine '  hesitating, for I
feared to displease her  ' surely you could have
married over and over again if you had liked.'

One only wants to marry once, Olga,'
smiling as though my speech amused her.
After all, there is only one man a woman can
bring herself to marry.'

Whom do you mean ?' in some perplexity.

I mean, of course, the man she loves.
Doesn't that go without saying ?'

Yes, of course ; but  no, you will think me
impertinent. I will not ask such a question.'

Your eyes ask it Instead. Yes, there was
someone whom I could have married.'

And for whose sake you have remained
single  oh, Aunt Catherine !'

You question rather closely, little one ; but
never mind, it is a very old story ; it does not
give me pain now. When I was your age,
Olga, I was thrown almost daily into the
society of someone who seemed to me better
and nobler than anyone else. I never knew
anyone so absolutely true. He reminded me
of Nathaniel, for he was without guile. Young
as I was, I soon understood that he had a
higher standard of right and wrong than most
men.'

Will you tell me a little more about him ?'
creeping closer to her as I spoke, for there
was a shadow on the dear face.

Don't you think it is rather foolish of a
middle-aged woman to tell her love-story to a

girl ? Well, if you will hear it But there is

nothing much to tell. Other women would
have forgotten it long ago  would have loved
again, and have married ; but it was never
possible to me.'

Did you care for him so much ?'
How could I help It, knowing what he was ?
And then he was so good to me. I should have
grown up frivolous and pleasure-loving but for

him. Everything I have I owe to him. It is
strange to think that anyone so young should
have had such an influence. He was not so many
years older than I was. He was only in deacon's
orders when he first came to Brookfield.'

I had no idea he was a clergyman. Do you
mind telling me his name, and  and was he
very attractive-looking ?'

Aunt Catherine smiled at the feminine question.


That is so like a girl, Olga ! His name is
Robert Fleming. No, he was not handsome ;
on the contrary, he was plain  but it was a
face one could trust at once. I used to think it
beautiful when he was preaching. My father
was always hospitable to the clergy. Mr.
Fleming used to dine at the Hall once or twice
a week. He was a clever and amusing companion,
and his conversation was always agreeable
to my father. After a time he volunteered
to teach me Latin and botany, and then we
Averse always together. Was it any wonder,
then, that we grew to care too much for each
other ? Surely the blame was not ours ? I
can only marvel at the blindness of my father
and Virginia ; but no one suspected anything
until too late. I think that year was the happiest
of my life. Every day brought new
pleasure. I never asked myself the reason

why I took life so joyously. I was young, and
the world was very beautiful, and Robert was
good to me.

But one day the revelation came. In an
unguarded moment, when we were alone, the
truth came out. Robert loved me too much
for his own peace of mind ; either he must
leave Brookfield, or I must give him hope that
his feelings were returned. I do not need to
tell you, Olga, that my whole heart belonged to
him. I owned my affection frankly, and for
one day at least we where happy.

I remember that night I could hardly sleep
for joy. I lay hour after hour recalling his
looks and words. I seemed to ask no more of
life than Robert's love, and to feel that we belonged
to each other. But my happiness was
short-lived. When 1 saw him again he looked
worn and harassed. To my dismay T found
that he was blaming himself severely for his
imprudent confession. " Your father will have
a right to reproach me for my dishonourable
conduct, Catherine," he said sorrowfully. '' I
ought not to have betrayed my feelings. There
is only one course open to me. As a gentleman,
I must at once acquaint him with what has
happened." And in spite of my entreaties and
tears  for I feared to lose him  he sought at
once an interview with my father.

I need not tell you the result : my father was
bitterly angry with us both ; Robert was forbidden
the house, and I was reproved most
harshly and cruelly for my undignified behaviour
in encouraging a poor curate. In
vain I protested that I loved him dearly, that
I would never marry any man but Robert
Fleming. My father simply refused to hear a
word. We were ordered to pack up at once and
leave the Hall  we were to go abroad, and
remain there as long as Robert was at Brookfield.
Olga, it was only through Virginia's connivance
that I bade Robert good-bye. It was
a bitterly sad parting : neither of us had any
hope.

" I am a poor man, Catherine," he said tome
; " my people are comparatively humble
folk. I have no interest, I cannot expect
success in this life  I shall never be able to
win you  the prize is not for me  I am justly
punished for having dared to love you." And
those were almost his last words to me.'

Do you mean you have never seen him
since ?'

Never, Olga, except at a distance. Robert
Fleming and I parted that summer morning forever
in this world. We went to Rome, and
before our return he had left Brookfield ; and
the only thing I heard was, that he had been

ill, and that an uncle had taken him abroad. If
we suffered, my poor father had his punishment
too. To save me from marrying the best man
in the world, he took us to the place where poor
Virginia met her wretched husband. But for
this she might have been a happy woman now.'

And you have never heard of him ?'

Not until my father's death, a good many
years afterwards, and then a casual acquaintance
we met at some watering-place mentioned his
name. He had a curacy at Leeds, and was
working in a very poor parish. She told me
the name of his church, and a year or two afterwards,
when I was within a few miles of the
place, I went one evening in the hope of hearing
him preach.'

Did you really ? Oh, Aunt Catherine, but
did he not recognise you ?'

He could not, for I had a thick veil, and sat
at the end of the church. But I could see him
distinctly ; he looked older and thinner, and
stooped a good deal, but it was the same good,
kind face. And his sermon was beautiful ; it
strengthened me for a long time.'

But why  why has he never come to you ?
Is he married ?'

No, he has never married, but that is all I
know about him. I have never expected him
to come. He is still a curate, and I am a rich

woman, and belong to a county family, besides.
How can I tell ? he may have forgotten me 
a man is different to a woman.'

But you have many friends  grand, influential
ones ; could you not have helped him
secretly to a better position ?'

What a little plotter you are, Olga. How do
you know that I have not tried ? More than
one living has been offered to Mr. Fleming 
comfortable country livings; but he cannot be
persuaded to leave his curacy. They say he is
doing a great work there, a very great work,'

Why do you look like that, Aunt Catherine ?
you are keeping something back.'

 Oh, it is nothing,' she said, with her pretty
middle-aged blush ; ' only I like to think I help
him in that work. From time to time the
curate of St. Mark's receives a sum of money
from one who signs herself, "The Friend of the
Poor." He has never seen the handwriting 
the world is full of these shy philanthropists.
Of course, he takes the money and is thankful,
and asks no questions.'

Dear  dear Aunt Catherine, that is so like
you.'

But it is not like me to romance after this
fashion ; you are a little witch, Olga, to coax
this story from me. Shall we call it the Old
Maid's Secret ?'

Don't call yourself names ; you are as nice
now as you ever have been. Jem and I have
always admired you so ; you are not a bit old
there is not a gray hair on your head.'

I will show you hundreds tomorrow. Come,
do not let us talk so foolishly. I am old-fashioned
enough to believe in Providence  what is, Is
best. One day, when our work Is done, Robert
Flemlncf and I shall meet asfaln. I can wait
happily till then.'

And this Is why you have never married ?'

Well, you would not have me content with
the second best ?  there was only one Robert
Fleming. Now, never let us speak of this
again. Let me give you one piece of advice 
you are young enough to need it : make greater
allowances for the so-called old maids ; poor
things, they are often dull and uninteresting,
and have odd, fussy ways, but you do not know
what trouble and pain may be In their past.
Many of them have young and faithful hearts
in spite of their wrinkles. There, I have
preached my little sermon,' and as Aunt
Catherine said this she rose from her seat, and
we went back under the firs and across the
cornfield to La Maisonnette.

THE Pavilion IN THE GARDEN.

Then saunter down the terrace, where the sea,
All fair with wing-like sails, you may discern ;
Be glad, and say, " This beauty is for me 
A thing to love and learn." '

Jean Angelo.

The next few days passed pleasantly. Aunt
Catherine was a delightful companion. With her
usual unselfishness she put her own cares and
anxieties aside, and only thought how she could
add to my enjoyment. The weather was lovely ;
every morning the bright sunshine woke me ;
and as I begrudged every moment spent
indoors, we were out from morning to evening.
As soon as our early breakfast was over, and
Aunt Catherine had settled down to write
business letters, or talk over housekeeping
matters with Jeanne, I used to put on my
broad-brimmed hat and go down to the shore,
accompanied by my faithful Rollo. A steep

little lane, with arching trees overhead, and a
high, fern-covered bank on one side, led down to
the bay. The wall of the Chateau de Clairville
was on the other side ; in the distance one
could see the blue waters of the bay. A little
farther on was a pool, where the women washed
their clothes. Often I came upon a little group
chattering and laughing as they beat out the
linen on the stones. A rugged path led up the
cliff to St. Croix. On Sunday we walked to
the little English church, and passed the tiny
cemetery and the hospital. As we returned
that evening a glorious sunset was hushing the
bay, and we stood for a long time looking at
the lovely scene. Below us was the quiet
cemetery, with its black wooden crosses and
wreaths of immortelles, and beyond lay the
gleaming golden waters. The sun was just
sinking in a mass of crimson clouds ; the western
sky seemed lit with strange radiance ; the marvellous
tints melted and glided into each other
with prismatic brilliancy ; the deep red sail of a
fishing-boat seemed to float between earth and
sky ; then came a snowy-white one ; an indescribable
hush and stillness seemed to brood
over the scene, as though some holy watcher
stood above the quiet dead. A little beyond
was the hospital ; before it lay a green enclosure
with grass and trees, overlooking the bay. As

we walked slowly past, we could see a group of
sisters in their gray habits and white hoods
sitting under the trees. One of the sisters was
reading aloud ; as we paused a moment, a tall,
dark-eyed sister, with a beautiful face and the
step of a queen, crossed the road and looked
at us. The clear, kindly eyes lingered long in
my memory.

Aunt Catherine,' I said sofdy, as we went
down the cuff, ' did you see that sister's face ?
She looked like a St. Cecilia.'

I saw a very handsome nun,' replied Aunt
Catherine dryly ; * depend upon it, she is quite
human. Well, they are all good women, though
not perhaps as grown-up as we are  but that is
the fault of the system ; still, theirs are noble
lives, Olga, spent in ministering to the sick
bodies and souls of their brothers and sisters.
One might well envy them their usefulness.'

But for once I found Aunt Catherine's middle-aged
philosophy damping  the inspired face
and queenly gait of the grand-looking sister
haunted me. I could fancy that face bending
over the sick and dying, the pure sandy lips
murmuring consoling prayers. How worldly
and unsatisfactory one's life looked beside hers !
how petty one's aims and pleasures ! I looked
back more than once at that quiet scene, the
little band of hard-working women resting in

VOL. I. 15

the sunset, the one solitary voice breaking the
stillness.

I can read your thoughts, Olga,' observed
Aunt Catherine quietly ; ' you are envying those
good sisters yonder ; your young enthusiasm is
casting a glamour over them, as usual. My
dear, under those gray habits there beat very
faulty human hearts ; they do not find it easier
to be good than you and I ; they are just brave,
unselfish women, who have given up their lives
to Christ and His poor, but they have their
daily sinking of heart, their discouragements,
as much as you or I ; their little world, bounded
by those walls, is not more free from temptation
than our wider one.'

Yes, I know ; but, still, it seems so peaceful
and beautiful ; and then that face !'

St. Cecilia's, you mean. I wonder if Jeanne
can tell us anything about her ; perhaps, after
all, she is not more of a saint than that little
shrivelled-up sister we saw on the cliff just now;
in this world, alas ! beauty and holiness are not
synonymous terms.'

But I was not to be convinced, and from that
day I never passed the Hospital de St. Pierre
without watching for the dark-eyed sister.

Our mornings were always spent on the
shore  Aunt Catherine would join me when
her business was finished ; and we would choose

a seat under the shelter of the rocks and watch
the bathers and the children building their sand-castles.
If the afternoons were hot we always
sat in the little grove, but now and then we
drove into the country. Once Jules drove us
to the little village of Lorette. We seemed to
go on for miles, down long endless roads, past
cornfields, orchards ; then through one or two
scattered hamlets. Now and then there were
wider views, glimpses of the river, an expanse
of country opening out before us ; then the
road seemed to close in again, and we would
pass a solitary chateau.

All at once we stopped, and Jules assisted
us to alight. We were in a tiny village ; in
the middle of the street was a life-sized figure
of the Christ ; an old woman was spinning in a
doorway ; a group of handsome peasant girls,
with snowy caps and long earrings, were chatting
and laughing outside the little brown
auberge ; a woman was carrying a green crucis
to the well, in which, as we looked down, we
could see ferns growing out of the side. Just
opposite was a gray church ; another figure of
the Christ was in the churchyard. As we
entered the humble edifice we could see one or
two women kneeling ; a young priest was just
leaving the altar ; there was the usual smell of
incense.

Is not this an ideal village, Olga ?' observed
Aunt Catherine. ' I remember visiting it years
aero  the women were threshing corn in the
streets, the place seemed piled up with yellow
straw ; they were chanting some hymn to the
Virgin ; that old woman was spinning in her
door then. Now we have a long drive back,
and must not loiter, especially as Jules has
taken enough cider.'

And she was right ; it was dark before we
stopped at the big brown gate  Jeanne could
not see our faces as she threw open the door.

Madame was late,' she said in her shrill tones ;
it was Monsieur Rollo's voice that she heard
first : ** Open to your friends, my good Jeanne,"
that was what he said ; ma foi ! he was a dog of
sagacity  of intelligence. La demoiselle must
be tired above every-thing. Ah well, she,
Jeanne, had lighted the lamp, and the little
supper was all ready.'

Jeanne's little suppers were always very tempting
after one of these expeditions ; the big
coffee-pot always graced the board, and the bowl
of salad. The white china lamp made an oasis of
light in the great bare room ; the glass door
stood open ; gray moths dashed in from the
darkness, bent on speedy destruction ; in the
stillness we could hear the faint soughing of
the trees.

When supper was over, we betook ourselves
to the snug salon ; there were always letters to
write  to Jem, to Kitty, even a note to Hubert.
We could hear Jeanne moving about, washing
up dishes and talking to Rollo ; by-and-by
there would be the quick slamming of doors
and shooting of bolts.

How strange it is,' I said once, looking up
from my book, ' Fircroft and the Hall seem sofar
away ! I don't feel as though I shall ever
want to 2:0 back. I should like to eo on living
as we are for years  just you and I, and Rollo.'

ind without Jem ? Is the dearly-loved
brother so soon forgotten ?'

Jem would come and see us sometimes. He
is not always at Fircroft, you know. When he
has left Oxford he will have to live in London.
We talk of that sometimes, and wonder if
Hubert will let me join him there. Jem and I
have always planned to live together.'

You would leave us all, Olga ?'

'Not willingly; but if Jem wanted me I
would go. I do not like to think of him alone
in London. Jem ought to be my first consideration
; we are everything to each other.
Hubert has Kitty and the children. I am not
needed at Fircroft ; that is what I have always
felt.'

I should miss you very much !'

Not more than I should miss you ; but Jem
will have two more years at Oxford ; besides, by
that time, you may have Basil. When Basil
comes, Jem and I may not be needed.'

Is that how you judge of my friendship,
Olcra ?'

No, indeed !'

But I kissed her with a feeling of remorse ;
for I was afraid that deep down in my heart
there was latent jealousy of this Basil. If he
should ever take possession of the Hall, Jem
and I would be outsiders. ' It is our own that
we want, our own flesh and blood,' that was
what Aunt Catherine had said. It was Basil,
not Jem, not this foolish child Olga, who must
be taught the family traditions, who must be
instructed in the old historic lore. Lady
Gwendoline and a score of dead and buried
Seftons were to be introduced to Basil as his
rightful ancestors. I was only a poor little girl
whom the ladies had adopted out of sheer
kindliness. Well, it was just, but it was a little
hard ; for would this Basil, this stranger with
his foreign education, his un-english habits,
ever love Aunt Catherine as Jem and I loved
her!

And so you would like this odd life of ours
to go on for years ?' asked Aunt Catherine
with a smile of amusement ; ' and what would

become of the Hall, and the estate, and Virginia,
and my poor people, you unpracticable young
person ?'

I am not thinking of details,' I returned
loftily ; ' at present I want things to go on in
the same way  to spend endless mornings on
the shore, to wander along the cliffs in the
evening, to drive down to St. Genette, to make
excursions, to drink coffee under the trees.
The air is like champagne ; it seems to get into
my head. I long to run about with the children
on the sands. When I bathe I feel like a
water-nymph splashing with her companions.
1 feel so young, and so strong, and so happy,
happier than I have ever felt in my life. Aunt
Catherine.'

Aunt Catherine looked at me attentively.

I never saw you look so well, certainly.
You look like a wild-rose, Olga  sweet and fresh,
but full of little thorns, too ; it does me good
only to look at you. Come, shall I plan another
expedition ? Shall we go down the river in the
steamer and spend a few hours at Chamber,
dine at a restaurant, and look over the town ?
We shall be back by ten.'

Delightful ! let us go tomorrow.'

What an impetuous child ! You remind me
of the old French proverb, *' Un ' tiens ' vaut
mieux que deux ' tu I'aurais';" in plain English,

" One ' holdfast' is better than two ' thou shalt
have it,' " or, as we generally say, " A bird in the
hand is worth two in a bush." Well, well, we
will go tomorrow.'

And that was how Aunt Catherine spoilt
me.

The clergyman and his wife had called on usa
few days after we arrived, but with this exception
we had no visitors. Some of the
English people looked at us curiously when we
went down to the bathing-place, but we kept
entirely to ourselves.

One evening I was lying in the hammock ;
we had been at St. Genette all the afternoon,
and we were both tired. Aunt Catherine was
resting on the couch in the salon ; but the air of
the house stifled me, and I preferred swinging
under the dark trees, and watching the eerie
dusk creep over the garden-paths. A lite
crescent of a moon hung in the dark summer
sky, and one or two stars peeped out over the
house.

A cool, delicious air stirred the leaves above
me, and fanned my temples refreshingly.
I was thinking of Jem ; wondering what he
thought of my long letters, full of descriptions,
and half afraid they would be put into his
pocket half read, when a low growl from Rollo
disturbed me, and a moment after a tall, dark

figure emerged from a clump of gooseberry-bushes
In the kitchen-garden and walked
rapidly down the little path. It had been Impossible
In the darkness to distinguish any
features ; but as I raised myself In the hammock
1 judged by the free, swinging gait that
the Intruder must be young. The light,
springy step certainly did not belong to
Monsieur Perrot, who was old and fat, and had
a stubbly gray beard. The Incident was a
little disturbing, and, in spite of the cheerful
light from Jeanne's unsheltered window, I felt
unwilling to remain under the dark trees.

I had a disagreeable Impression that the little
gate close to me might be suddenly unlatched ;
that even now a face might be peering at me
through the bushes. Rollo was still sniffing
about uneasily. I called him quickly, and sprang
from the hammock, but as soon as I was in the
house I began to laugh at my own cowardice.

You were startled, Olga,' observed Aunt
Catherine soothingly, ' and it is so dark under
those trees. I should have felt the same
myself. Most likely it was Monsieur Perrot's
lodger. You know, he told me he had a
lodger ; It may be a young man, for all we
know, though I was foolish enough to make up
my mind the lodger was a lady.'

But what was he doing so late in the

kitchen-garden ? Monsieur Perrot's house is
some way from here.'

This seemed to pose Aunt Catherine.

I am sure I don't know,' she said, much
amused at my earnestness ; * but we don't want
any mysterious young men suddenly emerging
from gooseberry-bushes. Monsieur Perrot is
away just now ; on his return 1 will question
him about his lodger. Wait a moment, though,
I have an idea; Monsieur Perrot mentioned
the pavilion once  that is the little barn-like
building at the end of the garden. Most likely
he is an artist, and uses the pavilion as a
studio. Yes, this is no doubt the truth. So,
after all, it was only a harmless artist smoking
his pipe among the cabbages.'

Perhaps Jeanne would know.'

I advise you not to question her. Jeanne
is an inveterate gossip. She would retail all
your remarks to Madame Perrot. After all,
Monsieur Perrot's lodger has nothing to do with
us. When it is dark you had better keep to this
end of the garden, and then you will not be
started.'

This was sensible advice, and I acted on it ;
but one evening, just as we were going to
supper, I remembered I had left a book belonging
to Aunt Catherine on a seat under the
trees.

It was a lovely moonlight night, and the long
path leading to the little grove was as bright as
day. The lawn was bathed in silvery radiance ;
only a dark shadow lurked under the trees.

I wish I had brought Rollo with me,' I
thought, as I went quickly down the path ; but
I was ashamed to turn back and call him. I
could hear Jeanne singing over her work.
Aunt Catherine was arranging some flowers in
the salon. They were both within call ; but
I confess I wished myself back in the house,
when I heard footsteps on the other side of
the hedge. With a sudden impulse I caught
up the book and drew back into the shade,
where no one could see me. The footsteps came
nearer, then paused. I felt as though I were
suffering nightmare. I was rooted to the spot,
and could not move. If only I had Rollo !
then I glanced fearfully behind me. After all,
the sight was not so terrible.

A young man was leaning on our little gate
and looking at the house. His face was turned
from me, but I could just see a little gray
peaked-cap drawn over his eyes, with a glimpse
of dark, closely-cropped hair.

Just then Aunt Catherine's figure blocked up
the lighted doorway.

Olga, my child, where are you ?' she exclaimed
anxiously.

I dared not answer, for fear of betraying
myself. But Aunt Catherine's clear voice had
broken the spell. The dark head and gray
cap disappeared. A moment afterwards the
quick footsteps receded into the distance, and I
ran down a side-path towards the house. Aunt
Catherine was looking for me.

Where have you been hiding, Olga ? Why
did you not answer when I called ? I am
almost sure I saw someone standing by the
gate, only the trees obscured my view. Why,
you look quite pale and scared ; was there really
someone ?'

Yes, yes !' I exclaimed excitedly ; ' it was a
tall man  but I could not see his face  he had
a gray tweed coat ; I could see that distinctly,
for he was leaning on the orate, Aunt Catherine !'

o o

with a little gasp : ' he was watching the house.'
And why should he not watch the house ?'
she said cheerfully ; for she saw I was shaking
with nervousness.  You are as bad as Jeanne,
Olga. Do you know, nothing would induce
her to pass the cemetery at night  no, not if her
dearest friend were dying. Is there any law
why Monsieur Perrot's lodger should not use
his eyes ? Have you any idea how bright and
pleasant our house looks when the lamps are
lighted and there is a warm stream of radiance
through the open door ? Why should not the

poor man stand and admire the cheerful prospect
? I dare say he felt like that poor young
man in " Excelsior"  don't you remember how
it goes ?'

" In happy homes he saw the light

Of household fires burn warm and bright ;
Above the spectral glaciers shone,
And from his lips escaped a groan :
Excelsior !'"' '

Jem has quite spoiled '* Excelsior " for me,
by parodying it. He destroys all the beauty
of my favourite pieces.'

I call that a blot on Jem's character ; the
cleverest parody is objectionable to me ; it is a
worse sin in my eyes than punning ; it is as bad
as caricaturing one's friends, or mocking them
behind their back. You must break Jem of that
odious habit.'

He does it all the more because he knows
how it teases me. He has even parodied
Longfellow's beautiful poem, *' Tell me not in
mournful numbers." You know how much I
love it ; but he turned it all into an ode against
eating roast pork ; it was so funny and yet so
clever.'

I shall never remember Jem in my will,
unless he turn over a new leaf. I think I will
tell him that. Well, Olga, have you got over
your fright yet ? Can you bear to think a

human being Is solaced by the sight of our

lamp ?'

I was a pfoose to be so frightened ; after all,
he looked like a gentleman.'

He ! I suppose you mean your artist friend
who has managed to drive away your colour ?
What a silly child you are ! but all the same,
you must promise me never to go near those
trees again after dark unless I am with you.'

I promised this very readily, but Aunt
Catherine was in a teasing mood all supper-time,
and did not spare me ; she even threatened
to write to Jem, and tell him what a little
coward I was  as though Jem did not know
that long ago ; and finally she proposed that we
should take a turn in the garden, and so exorcise
the fearful spirit.

Oh ! I don't mind it a bit with you and Rollo,'
I returned, quite pleased at the idea.

Well, this is a ghostly place, I confess !' she
said, as we stood together under the trees.
Olga, you have infected me with your curiosity.
I am actually going a few steps up that path 
keep where you are  and I will be back in a
moment. Rollo, stop with your mistress.'

Don't go far,' I pleaded, for the nightmare
feeling was returning ; but Rollo's glossy
head was against me ; and in another minute
Aunt Catherine returned.

She closed the gate carefully behind her.

There is a light in the pavilion. Our artist
friend works late. I could hear him whistling.
The window was wide open, so I did not
venture near. What a crazy old building it
looks in the moonlight ! But it must be a quiet
sort of place to work in. What is that Rollo
is carrying in his mouth ?'

I stooped to look, and Rollo wagged his
tail, and dropped something at my feet. He
evidence thought he was presenting me with
a treasure. It was a little white cotton glove,
such as children wear, with a ragged thumb, as
though tiny teeth had been nibbling it.

I looked at it in some bewilderment.

The Parrots have no little children belonor-

o

ing to them, have they, Aunt Catherine ?'

No ; their eldest son is unmarried, and their
daughter, a widow, has only one boy of fourteen.
I have heard all their family history from
Jeanne. I wonder where Rollo found his-treasure.
Perhaps some children have been
weeding the garden.'

Poor people's children do not wear gloves,'
I returned. ' Rollo picked It up by the gate.
I saw him sniffing at something in the grass ?'

Perhaps the artist is a married man and has
children, and that is why he works so late.
Come, I am beginning to take a kindly interest

in him. We shall weave quite a romance about
him presently. Now, it is getting late ; I can
hear Jeanne shutting up. Will you light our
candles, Olga ? and then we will retire to
bed.'

A BUTTERFLY-HUNT.

Dear boy, thy momentary laughter rings
Sincerely out, and that spontaneous glee,
Seeming to need no hint from outward things,
Breaks forth in sudden shouting, loud and free.

From what hid fountains doth thy joyance flow.
That borrows nothing from the world around ?
Its spring must deeper lie than we can know 
A well whose springs lie safely underground.'

Archbishop Trench.

The next morning, as I was standing in the
sunny courtyard feeding the chickens, Aunt
Catherine stepped out of the glass-door, that
opened out of the salle-manger, in her big
flapping hat, with her favourite gossamer veil
twisted round it.

I find I have no important letters to
answer this morning,' she said briskly; 'and
Jeanne can manage without me, so I shall comedown
with you to the shore. Do you mind

VOL. L 1 6

choosing a quieter spot this morning ? for those
noisy English girls quite disturbed me yesterday


Let us go beyond the little bathing-house.
There are some deliciously-shady nooks among
the rocks,' I returned eagerly, for I rather endorsed
her opinion. I had grown tired of the
bustle of the bathing-place, with its row of little
gaudily-striped cabanes, the splashing and
joyous cries of the bathers, and the groups of
nurses and children. Some fast-looking men
had made acquaintance with a family of English
girls, and a great deal of flirtation and giggling
had been the result. They made fun of everyone
; even Aunt Catherine did not escape their
witticisms.

There comes the old maid in the gray hat,'
I heard them say once when I was sitting alone
among the rocks. ' Does she not look like a
flapping seagull ? I suppose she is afraid of her
complexion. I wonder what has become of the
little girl who is always with her ; she's not a
bad little thing, after all.'

Do you mean the girl in brown, who swims
so well. Eraser T  but I would not hear anymore.
Why did those odious creatures take
possession of the place } How could any ladylike
girls tolerate them } To call my dear Aunt
Catherine an old maid, and to sneer because

she took care of her smooth, girlish complexion !
Oh, I had no patience with them !

So we crossed the common and went down
the steep Httle path by our bathing-house, and
after a short scramble over the rocks we found
a nice shady corner, where we spent the morning.
I had my sketch-book and colour-box
with me, as I wanted to send Jem a little painting
of the bay, with its rocky Islands, and the
low-hanging woods on the opposite shore ; and
Aunt Catherine had her knitting and book.
Sometimes when she came to a passage that
she liked she read it aloud to me, and that made
the time pass very pleasantly.

I think we were both sorry when the time
came for going back to La Maisonnette. I
was just putting up my painting materials
when Aunt Catherine nudged my arm and
whispered :

What a pretty child, Olga !'

I looked up quickly. A young man in a gray
tweed coat was springing over the rocks with a
little boy In a white sailor suit seated on his
shoulder. The child had a lite red cap,
under which his long hair was streaming in the
breeze.

Gee-gee, Mr. Horse !' he ci-died gaily.
Reggie wants to go faster faster.'

Hold tight, old man !' was the reply.

162

As they both passed us the loveliest little
face looked down upon us, a small hand waved
to Rollo. I started, and uttered a smothered
exclamation : the peaked gray cap and dark,
closely-cropped hair recalled the intruder of'
last night. But before I could give vent to
this suspicion Aunt Catherine interrupted me.

Look  look ! the child has dropped his cap,
and his brother does not know it she said
anxiously. ' The little creature will have a sunstroke.
Oh dear ! oh dear !'

My only answer was to jump up. The cap
was soon in Rollo's mouth, but he gave it up tome
at once. How hot the sun was ! Rollo
rushed at my side with joyous barks as I flew
over the sand. Jem had once told me that I
could beat any girl in a fair race ; but we were
in the shady road beside the washing-pool before
I could overtake those long swift strides.

I beg your pardon,' I panted ; ' but the
little boy has dropped his cap.'

The young man started and turned round.

Oh, Reggie !' he said reproachfully ; but the
boy only burst into a merry laugh.

Reggie's head is hot,' he said in a tone of
perfect satisfaction.

Thank you so much continued the young
man. ' Have you run after us all that way 
you were sitting under the rocks, were you not ?

Reggie, thank this lady prettily for the trouble
she has taken.'

Reggie banks '00/ repeated the child
glibly.

He had a soft little cooing voice ; the young
man lifted his gray cap with another ' Thank
you,' and went on his way.

He is quite young,' I said to myself as I
walked slowly back. ' There is something
almost boyish in his manner ; and yet it is a
singular face  dark and smooth, and with such
pronounced features ; but he is a gentleman.
I liked his voice.'

You ran as highly as a gazelle, Olga,' were
Aunt Catherine's first words ; 'but, my dear, I
fear you must have overheated yourself. Did
you ever see a prettier child, Olga ? It was
such a bewitching little face.'

I wonder who they can be I returned in a
puzzled voice. ' I am sure  very nearly sure,
at least  that it is the same young man who
was leaning on the gate watching our house
last night. Of course, I could not see his face,
but his figure looked the same.'

what nonsense, Olga! What could have
put such an absurd notion into your head?
Monsieur Perrot's lodgers must belong to
quite a different class ; this young man did
not look at all like a poor artist. You know

Monsieur Perrot's house is quite a humble
cottage ; it cannot afford much accommodation.'

Still, I am convinced it is the same person,' I
replied obstinately ; and nothing Aunt Catherine
could say could alter this opinion in the least.
I am rather glad I have seen him by daylight,'
I finished ; ' for now I shall not feel in the least
nervous if I hear footsteps behind the hedge
again. One does not dread an ordinary young
man in a well-cut tweed coat.'

And though Aunt Catherine laughed at this
definition, she did not argue the matter anymore.


I think the beautiful child must have made
an impression on Aunt Catherine's soft heart.
She was a child-lover by nature, for she alluded
to him again that day, so I knew she had not
forgotten him. As for me, I own I had a feeling
of curiosity ; when one is idle, the smallest
trifle will interest one.

Perhaps by this time I was beginning to feel
that the life at La Maisonnette was a little
solitary. Aunt Catherine might be content with
it, but I was young enough to think that even
a mere passing acquaintance would be pleasant.
How nice if I had that dear little Reggie to
play with ! I could fancy him darting over the
lawn in pursuit of butterflies : a child would be
such an amusement !

!47

The next morning we went to the same
place, and I found myself several times looking
up from my sketch-book in the hope of seeing
a little figure in a white sailor suit playing on
the sand ; but only a bonne and a few chattering
children passed us.

As we went home, toiling a little wearily up
the steep shady road, Aunt Catherine told me
that she had ordered Jules to bring the fiacre
at half-past two.

I am going to drive down to the Rue
d'Eglise,' she explained, ' in the hope that
Monsieur Lefevre has returned. We have
been here a fortnight and nothing has been done.
Poor Virginia's last letter was so sad ; Marsden
says she is already wearying for our return.'

Do you wish to go alone. Aunt Catherine ?'

Yes, dear, I think it will be best ; and the
drive will be so hot. I have some shopping todo,
too ; but I shall be back by tea-time. You
will not be dull, Olga ?'

I scouted this idea with some energy.

I mean to spend the afternoon under the
fir-trees below the common,' I said presently.
I shall get a breeze from the bay there, and
it will be cool looking at that green pool belonging
to the Chateau de Clairville.'

'And thinking of the poor drowned boy,
Henri Delaincourt. I think our own little grove

would be more cheerful ; but I believe you are
still afraid of the owner of the pavilion.'

I contradicted this stoutly. I was afraid of
no young men In tweed suits, either in daylight
or by moonlight. I only wanted variety and
a breeze from the bay. So I carried my point,
and presently stood on the steep bank looking
down at the passers-by in the road beneath,
and then, seating myself at the foot of one of
the firs with my open book in my lap and
Rollo's glossy black head beside me, I soon
fell into a blissful day-dream.

It was an enchanting spot; the sombre green
pool closed In with trees looked cool and refreshing.
To my left were the blue flashing
waters of the bay. Some soldiers were going
down to the shore. I could see their red
shoulder-knots through the trees. I could hear
the women's voices from the washing-pool.
Below there was life, amusement, human
activity ; but above was the quiet sunshiny
common with Its broom and gorse and purpling
heather.

We had spent more than an hour in this
delicious ' far niente,' when Rollo suddenly
pricked up his ears and sat on his haunches as
though suspicious of some crackling sound
behind us. I peeped cautiously round the tremble.
To my astonishment I saw a little white

groping figure in the dry ditch ; the gleam of
a red cap was plainly visible, with long, straight
hair under it. The next moment it emerged

o

bodily from the ditch and commenced running
down the steep slope leading to the road.

It was rather a dangerous declivity for little
feet, and I rose hastily with a warning cry.

Where could his brother be ? surely the child
was not alone on the common ?' I thought of
the cliff with a shudder ; even if he ran too fast
now, he might tumble into the road below.

Reggie !' I exclaimed, ' come away !' for the
little creature was flashing between the trees
like a will-o'-the-wisp ; he was evidently in
pursuit of a large moth. ' Rollo, lie still!' I said
authoritatively, for I was afraid the dog might
frighten him if he joined in the chase. Rollo
obeyed reluctantly, and sat up panting, and
with watery, eager eyes, watching me as I ran
down the slope. Reggie saw me and stopped
still.

Reg wants that butter pie,' he said plaintively,
pointing with his finger to the tree
above us.

The butterfly has flown away,' I replied,
taking his hand.

His dear little face looked hot and eager;
his beautiful eyes were large and wistful ; he
had his cap hugged closely to him ; his dark hair

was cut across his temples in the fashion children
were wearing it just then ; he was so pretty I
could not help kissing him ; but he seemed to
take my attention as a matter of course.

Reg wants to ride on the big doggie,' was
his next remark, and he walked up to Rollo in
the most confiding way, and patted him. ' Gee
up, doggie !'

And actually one little leg was across him
before I caught him away.

Rollo does not like little boys to ride on
him. Shake hands with him instead.'

And as Rollo proffered his clumsy big paw,
Reggie broke into a fit of musical laughter and
clapped his hands before his mouth.

k\mny big doggie ! Reggie must not laugh,
or the doggie will be angry. Good-bye,
doggie. Reggie wants more batteries !'

And he was darting away again ; but I had
my arms round him in a minute.

Where is Reor<Tie's brother ?' I asked.
Reggie must be a good boy and find him.
Good little boys do not run about alone.'

The child seemed perplexed at my question.
He looked at me, then at Rollo ; then a merry
light came into his eyes.

Reggie wanted batteries! Reggie ruined
away ! What larks !'

Yes, actually that innocent babe, for he could

not have been more than four years old, said
What larks !' and burst out laughing again.

I was at my wits' end ; was he really speaking
the truth, or was it only nonsense ? but before
I could make up my mind to believe him he
had escaped from my hand.

Good-bye ; Reg is going home,' and he
was darting round the corner as fast as his
little legs would carry him He laughed more
than ever when he saw I was in pursuit of
him  it was evidently a rare game to Reggie ;
in fact, he laughed so much that he had to
stop and take breath, so I caught him up
easily. He gave me a droll lite look then,
and put his hand in mine of his own accord.

Reg is tired,' he observed confidentially ;
but when I offered to carry him he shook his
head with much dignity.

Where Is Reggie's big gQC-gee ?' I asked,
with sudden inspiration. He understood meat
once.

Over there,' he said, pointing in the direction
of La Maisonnette. He had led me down
one of the paths leading off the common, and
we were in a lite copse now  beyond us lay
some fields. Reggie, who was dragging at my
hand rather wearily, pointed to a lite path.

Reggie ruined all down there, and the
butter pie ruined too.'

Did you come down that path, really ?'

He nodded vigorously. I had never been
there before, and I had no idea where it led.
Reggie seemed acquainted with it ; he went
along contentedly, now and then stopping to
gather a bright-coloured weed, and crooning a
little tunc to himself. Only once, as the path
turned off, and I was still going up the field, he
pulled me back.

Reg lives there he said, pointing to a
brown, barn-like building in the distance.

With a sort of shock I discovered we were at
the back of the pavilion. A lite door in the
wall stood open ; I could see the grass-grown
steps, and the apple-trees in the kitchen-garden.
I was so surprised that I stood quite still, until
Reggie gave me a little push and we went in.

Reggie slammed the door behind us ; then,
quite ignoring my presence, he stumped up the
worn steps. I followed him slowly.

Reggie's toned back,' he said, pushing open
another door ; but there was no answer. I
guessed at once the room was empty. I made
up my mind that I was entering an artist's
studio, but as I followed Reggie I looked round
in some surprise  it was fitted up as a living
room. It was a large, bare-looking apartment,
with three windows, each commanding a different
aspect. One of them looked out on our

little grove ; I could see the empty hammock
swaying in the slight breeze.

A ladder communicated evidently with a loft ;
a gray kitten sat on the lowest step washing its
face. The furniture was of the plainest description
 a bed, covered with a blue quilt; a
washstand, with a large green crucis ; a round
table in one window, an armchair, covered with
seedy-looking red velvet, beside it ; a portable
cupboard, with a coffee-pot and some yellow
cups and saucers ; another table, with writing
materials and books ; a wooden chair or two ;
and a leathern portmanteau, with a rug tossed
upon it. There was a small closed stove, but
it had not been lighted ; on the top was a small
tin kettle with a spirit-lamp under it, ready for
kindling. Reggie looked round rather piteously.

Reg wants his tea,' he said, pursing up his
dear little mouth as though he were going
to cry.

I sat down by the writing-table and took him
up in my lap to comfort him. There was a pile
of neatly-bound books lying near me. I could
just see the titles  an edition of Sophocles,
The Epic of Hades,' ' The Light of Asia,' by
Edwin Arnold, and Carlyle's ' French Revolution.'
1 had no time to see more ; for just then
there was a rapid footstep outside  the door
was pushed open, and the young man in the

gray tweed suit was looking at us from the
threshold.

He seemed transfixed with astonishment, and
a flush crossed his face as though he were
embarrassed. I rose at once, feeling very
nervous.

1 beg your pardon,' I stammered, ' for this
intrusion ; but I found your little brother straying
on the common in search of butterflies, and
brought him home : the place is not safe for so
young a child.'

He was about to answer, but Reggie interrupted
him.

The butter pie ruined away, and Reggie
runncd too,' he said calmly, as though he were
stating an important fact.

Oh, Reg, Reg  how am I ever to trust you
again,' replied the young man, taking him in
his arms and looking at him with reproachful
tenderness  ' when you promised me not to
stir?' Then, turning to me, as I witnessed this
little scene with unfeigned interest, he said
earnest : ' 1 have to thank you a second time
on Reggie's behalf. You arc quite right  the
common is not safe ; it was truly good of you
to bring him back ! Did Reggie show you the
way ?'

Yes ; he led me straight to the pavilion. I
was so surprised ! I had no idea that we were

such near neighbours  that anyone really lived
here,' looking round the room as I spoke.

I am afraid my speech was a little blunt, for
an odd expression crossed his face  a proud sort
of look.

I knew we were neighbours,' he replied
rather coolly ; ' for I have often seen you in the
garden of La Maisonnette. We are Monsieur
Perrot's lodgers, Reggie and I. He has kindly
fitted up this old pavilion for our use. It is
rather a rough sort of place, but I like it for a
change. We lead a picnic life ; it is rather fun,
isn't it, Reg ?'

You and your little brother ?'

Now, as Aunt Catherine said afterwards, I
had no right to stand there questioning a perfect
stranger ; but I cannot account for the strong
feeling of interest that prompted me to linger.

He gave a short laugh at my question.

You make a mistake ; I am Reggie's father,
not his brother,' he said quickly ; and I blushed
with annoyance at my error. He continued, as
though to set me at my ease, ' Other people
have thought the same as you.'

I was too confused to reply, and was turning
away with a murmured ' Good-mornings though
it was very nearly evening now, when Reggie
stooped from his high perch, for he was seated
on his father's shoulder.

Reg wants the lady to kiss him

The little darling, how was one to refuse ?
but as I imprinted a kiss on the smooth baby-face,
the young man said hurriedly :

I have not thanked you as I ought, and yet
you have saved me from a painful shock. If I
had found the room empty on my return, I
should have feared something had happened to
Reggie. I must never leave him again.' He
followed me to the steps, but did not offer his
hand. ' Believe me, I am truly grateful,' he
said with a pleasant smile that seemed to light
up his face.

Good-bye  good-morning, I mean !' was my
incoherent reply. ' I am so glad I found him !'
As I stepped into the little grass-grown path I
glanced back. They were still there watching me.
Reggie waved his hand ; his father lifted his cap.
I felt myself grow hotter every moment. ' I am
Reggie's father !' What an astonishing, what
an incredible avowal ! That boyish-looking
fellow Reggie's father ! and when I came to
reflect on it more coolly, why should I be so
surprised ? The smooth, dark face might be
older than it looked. He certainly expressed
himself with manly dignity ; but still he was
far, far too young to be a widower, and when I
told Aunt Catherine, on her return, she agreed
with me that it was very sad.

I suppose he is a widower, Olga,' she said
a lite doubtfully.

Yes, of course,' I returned eagerly ; ' he is
living" there alone with his little boy. Now I
come to think of it, he wore a plain gold ring
on his finger. You always know a widower by
that, and he is in mourning, too ; for though he
wears a gray tweed coat, he has a black tie.
Oh dear, how sad it seems, Aunt Catherine !
He is a gentleman, and yet he must be very
poor  the room looked so bare. It cannot be
pleasant to have a ladder in one's bedroom, and
there was no carpet, only a mat or two, on the
floor.'

You do not know his name ?'

No, indeed ; as it was, I am afraid he
thought me curious. When he came in he did
not seem quite pleased to see me there. I
am sure he is proud, and does not want people
to know he is poor.'

Very possibly. Monsieur Perrot could afford
to let him have the pavilion for a trifle. I think
it has been used as a store-house before. It
is a lite awkward for us, having such close
neighbours. You cannot help bowing to him,
of course, but it will never do to pick up an
acquaintance in this way.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, I must speak to that
dear little Reggie if I see him.'

VOL. I. 17

Aunt Catherine looked rather dubious at this.
The ladies were very particular on all questions
of etiquette, and of course she felt the charge of
a young girl rather an onerous responsibility.

Well, well, you can just nod to him,' she
said, dismissing the subject, and she told me
rather sadly the result of her expedition.

Monsieur Lefevre's brother is not yet
dead, Olga. They think he may linger sometime
yet. A young priest is taking Monsieur
Lefevre's place. I spoke to him for a moment.
He was very civil. He told me that it was
Monsieur Lefevre's only brother ; that he was
much younger and like a son to him, and that
he would not leave him until all was over.

' He may linger some time )ret," he said ;
there is great weakness, but little suffering.
He clings to life rather tenaciously, madame.
He has not weaned his affections from earth.
It is not always easy to wish for death when
one is not old, and as to that, the old are not
more willing than the young  it takes a saint
to die well. Some do not commence their
education until the class is called. Many of us
are not too ready with our lesson." Oh, we
had quite a conversation in the little dark
passage! He was a good young man ; he spoke
feelingly.'

I was not surprised that Aunt Catherine

owned herself a little tired  the delay was
peculiarly trying to her energetic nature. She
wanted to be doing something. But she tried
to throw off her lassitude, and made me go on
with a book we were reading together, and in
which I was much interested.

That night as I went to bed I stood for a
few minutes by my open window. The garden
was bathed in moonlight, and the leaves of the
trees below me had a strange silvery light on
them ; the summer wind was laden with the
perfume of the sleeping flowers.

I wonder if Reggie be sleeping too,' I
thought, as I at last turned away reluctantly ;
and my last thought that night was a vivid remembrance
of a little figure flashing between
the tree-trunks, and of a radiant upturned face,
and eager, groping hands, as the gay coloured
moth fluttered beyond his reach.

CHAPTER XV.

A FRIEND IN NEED.

He acted with the steadiness, promptitude, and determination
which belonged to riper years.'

Tic Monastery'

'Thou art obliging, friend, and, I doubt not, sincere.'

Castle Dangerous.'

The next day was Sunday, and as we walked
to the little English church at St. Croix I
secretly wondered if the occupant of the
pavilion were an orthodox churches, or if
he were, like other Bohemians, somewhat irreligious
in his habits. I was secretly afraid that
this latter surmise might be correct ; most likely
he was bathing, or boating, or perhaps wandering
over the sands with Reggie. Well, it was
no business of mine ; but all the same a feeling
of anxiety would intrude itself on my mind
when I thought of that sweet, engaging little
creature. ' And he has no one but his father

to set him an example I finished with youthful
severity.

I felt rather ashamed of my rash judgment
when, on entering the church, I saw a dark,
closely-cropped head before me, and, lower
down on the seat, a little figure in a white
sailor suit. They were sitting just before us,
and as I was kneeling down Reggie looked
round and grave me a radiant smile. I could
see him afterwards making signs to his father
to look too, but he shook his head and took no
notice.

What strange creatures we are ! I am sure
I enjoyed my service all the more for finding
I had been wrong in my uncharitable surmise.
Reggie was evidently quite accustomed to
go to church. After the first minute he
behaved beautifully  holding his Prayer-book
upside down, and sitting perfectly still during
the sermon, with such a dear; prim expression
on his little face, as though he knew how good
he was. His father, too, seemed very attentive
; he repeated all the responses, and sung
in a deep, rich voice. Once I saw him look at
Reggie, and a grave, sorrowful sort of expression
crossed his face ; and then he took,
the child's hand and held it all the rest of
the service.

As we went out they were very near us, and

I saw Reggie looking at me wistfully, as
though he wanted to speak to me ; but as I
nodded to him his father drew him quickly on.
I know he saw us, for he gave a quick glance
round ; but as we went out of the gate I saw
them walking down the town, as though they
were going to St. Genette.

Your little friend behaved very nicely,
Olga,' Aunt Catherine said, as we turned in
the opposite direction ; ' he was as quiet as a
little mouse all the service. And yet when I
saw him give you that merry look when we
first came in I was half afraid how things
might be.'

I never saw a child behave better.'

Nor I ; he has evidently been well brought
up. What an interesting little creature he is !
But his father looks very sad.'

Do you think so ?'

Yes ; I could see his face plainly once or
twice. It was a beautiful sermon, but I do not
believe he was listening. He seemed buried
in gloomy thoughts, and yet Mr. Baraud was
preaching about cheerfulness. He was dressed
very well  he is not at all shabby-looking 
and yet they are living in that odd way.'

'It is rather difficult to understand, certainly.'


He is a gentleman  I am sure of It. He

was quite aware that you were behind him in
the porch, but he thought it better not to take
any notice of you. The child was hanging
back, but he drew him on. We are such close
neighbours that most likely he considers any
recognition would be awkward. I call that
good taste on his part.'

I would not contradict Aunt Catherine, but
I had just felt a little bit offended. It would
not have hurt him to have bowed, or to have
let Reggie speak to me. I thought it was his
stiff English way to keep aloof, just because
we had not been formally introduced. Of
course he was a gentleman  I did not need
Aunt Catherine to tell me that; one's instinct
on such a point is never wrong. As I felt
slightly touchy, I thought it better to drop the
subject ; so I began talking about Jem  dear
old fellow !  and that always put me in a good
humour.

I was not surprised that they were missing
at evening service. Reggie was too young a
child for that ; but as we were walking down
the steep cliff-path leading to the washing-pool,
on our return, I saw the young man standing
under a clump of trees looking at the bay.

As we were passing he turned quickly round,
and we came face to face. He looked started,
and muttered a ' good-evening ' as he took off

his cap. Aunt Catherine made no remark,
neither did I. We both knew he was following
us up the lane. As we turned in at the
great brown gate, he walked quickly past, looking
straight before him.

The next morning we spent some hours on
the shore, as usual, and in the afternoon we sat
under the trees in the garden. As I knew we
were overlooked from the pavilion, I would not
use the hammock, and sat up as sedately as
Aunt Catherine. I was buried in my book,
and was not a little startled when the violent
shaking of the little gate behind me roused me
from my novel, and there stood Reggie, peeping
at us between the bars.

Open gate for Reggie,' he shouted.
Aunt Catherine rose at once.

What do you want, my dear ?' she asked
very kindly. ' You must run away, or father
will be looking for you.'

But Reggie stood his ground.

Who are you ? Reggie does not know you ;
Reggie wants the little lady. Open, please ' 
shaking the gate again.

Reggie ! what are you doing there ?' exclaimed
a stern voice. ' Come away this
moment !'

The child looked perplexed ; his father's
sternness was evidently new to him.

Father, come and open the gate,' he said,
with wistful confidence. ' Reggie wants to play
with the lady.'

No  nonsense !' and a hasty stride followed
the word.

The young man was just snatching him up,
when I said piteously, for the beautiful, eager
little face was too much for my stoicism :

Oh, please  please do let me have him fora
little, Aunt Catherine ! Do let me have him !
I should so like to play with him !'

I do not know what Aunt Catherine thought
of my impulsiveness, but she certainly made
the best of it.

Will you spare him to us for a little while ?'
she said, with her kind smile. ' This young
lady is so fond of children. We will take
great care of him.'

The young man bowed gravely ; he seemed
more embarrassed than pleased.

Certainly, If you are so kind as to wish for my
little boy's company. Reggie, old fellow, mind
you behave yourself like a gentleman.' He set
him down, and opened the gate. ' Please send
him back directly you are tired of him. Reggie
knows his way home ;' and with another
bow that included me he went back to the
pavilion.

Reggie jumped into my arms with a delighted

shout, and seemed to like my hugging
him. Then he pointed to the hammock, which
he called a swing, and very soon he was lying
in it with his eyes shut, ' going to sleep.' We
had a fine romp after that  Reggie and Rollo
and I. Aunt Catherine sat and watched us as
we dodged each other among the tiny flowerbeds,
or played at hide-and-seek in the bushes.
Sometimes we hid from Rollo, and he was as
clever as possible finding us out.

When Jeanne brought us our coffee, we sent
her back for milk and biscuits for Reggie. He
seemed almost too excited to eat. Once, when
a butterfly skimmed past us, he jumped up in
pursuit. The graceful little body darted hither
and thither over the lawn.

Isn't he lovely 1' I exclaimed, as he ran back
to us, his eyes sparkling with glee.

Butterpie gone home,' he said. ' Reggie
catched one yesterday ;' and he sat discontentedly
to his biscuits again.

A little later, as he was swinging again in
the hammock, I thought I would have some
conversation with him, so I began by saying :

Reggie dear, do you remember poor
mammie ?'

Mammie's an angel !' he returned promptly,
with a sentimental air. ' They put her in the
ground to grow. Father said so.'

Dear me ! What an extraordinary idea to
put into a child's head, Olga !'

Reggie looked up at the sky in a contemplative
manner  his expression was heavenly 
then he looked at me anxiously.

Will mammie grow ? Reggie digged for
her once. Reggie digged, and digged ; but
mammie was not there  only nasty black
worms ; so Reggie ruined away. Reggie hates
black worms !'

Don't question him any more, Olga !' interrupted
Aunt Catherine ; ' he is such a baby,
and of course his ideas of death are confused.
I have been thinking that, after all, it is not a
bad idea, on the part of Reggie's father. The
seed planted grows into the lovely flower;
so the child's imagination pictures a growing
angel. Think of the infantine faith  the baby
hands diorcrinor for the lost mother. What
marvels children are ! no miracle would astonish
their innocent eyes, and why ? because
life to them is one miracle. Don't you think
we might learn a lesson from them ? Why are
we human children to think ourselves grown up
with our heavenly Fathers How the angels
must wonder at us !'

Aunt Catherine was in one of her gente,
moralizing moods, but Reggie interrupted herby
suddenly scrambling out of the hammock.

Good-bye ; Reggie must go home now

Of course, the child has been with us for
two hours  he is quite right, dear little fellow !'
and Aunt Catherine opened the gate with suspicious
alacrity. Reggie started through it.

Reggie is here, father !' we heard him say.
The answer also reached us :

That's right : what a time you have been,
old man !'

Aunt Catherine was unusually thoughtful that
evening. But I was rather amused when at
supper she suddenly broke out into a little incoherent
speech, in which my injudicious impulsiveness
and her own blamable softness of
heart were rather severely rebuked.

I quite allow for the temptation,' she went on ;
but it is always best to think before one speaks.
I am afraid it was rather a liberty on our part.
I am not sure the young man was pleased ;
I know It was hard to refuse the darling 
such a sweet little pleading face as it was !  but
we cannot be too careful in a place like this.
What do we know about this young man,
except that he looks like a gentleman, and
lives in rather a Bohemian fashion ? and he
is not even an artist ;' as though, in Aunt
Catherine's opinion, this somehow complicated
matters.

I am afraid my argument in return for this

piece of excellent good sense was strictly
feminine, therefore no argument at all :

I can't help all that, Aunt Catherine ; Reggie
has fascinated me  I have fallen in love with
him, he is such a dear !' and though Aunt
Catherine shook her head at this girlish remark,
she evidently thought it useless to pursue the
subject.

As her warning was in vain, she had recourse
to diplomacy. So the next afternoon, as I was
preparing to go in the garden, she observed
that it would be pleasant on the common. I
was about to remonstrate, but I saw from her
expression that she had made up her mind
on the subject, so I thought it best to say
nothing.

It was the first afternoon that I did not
thoroughly enjoy, but when we went back to
take our coffee in the salle-manger, Jeanne
met us with uplifted hands.

Le pauvre enfant ! ah, it was heart-breaking !'

What do you mean ?' I exclaimed brusquely,
pushing past Aunt Catherine. * Surely nothing
has happened to Reggie ?'

Mille pardoned ! no, there was nothing to
make la demoiselle look so scared. But all the
same, it made her (Jeanne) triste to see the
little angel shaking the gate, and calling for la
demoiselle. * The lady who smiles,' that is

what he called the demoiselle, whom he Implored
to open the gate. 'C'est mol, Reggio
he affirmed constantly, and she (Jeanne) could
not pacify him ; poor little one ! he had cried
so bitterly, and monsieur had lifted him In his
arms and kissed him a dozen times as he carried
him away.

Ah ! Aunt Catherine,' I said reproachfully
and the dear thing looked quite sorry, and
ashamed of herself. Her simple little ruse had
Inflicted pain, and Aunt Catherine hated to give
pain, even to a fly. I think we both had a
pathetic picture In our minds at that moment,
of a little wistful face peering Into a forbidden
paradise. 'The lady who smiles '  what a pretty
description ! and what a stupid thing conventionality
was, if it would not allow one to play
with a child !

Aunt Catherine's primness was not proof
against all this pathos and disappointment, and
the next afternoon she had no objection to
allege against our favourite resort ; but this time
there was no interruption. Of course Reggie
was a prisoner In the pavilion ; his father's pride
could not brook interference from strangers ;
Reggie must be kept out of harm's way. ' The
lady who smiled' was an embarrassing and unnecessary
personage in the estimation of this
perverse young man.

Later in the evening I took a solitary
stroll. Aunt Catherine was tired; but, as I was
restless, she would not keep me in. ' Do not
go too far, Olga, and come back before the dusk
sets in,' were her parting words.

I had every intention of fulfilling these two
injunctions faithfully ; but it was a delicious
evening, and the lanes were enticing. I wandered
on, and the soft creeping twilight found
me still some distance from La Maisonnette.

I had met few people  an old woman with
two tethered cows grazing by the roadside, a
boy in a blue blouse, a little girl with a string of
red beads round her neck ; but by-and-by I
heard footsteps the other side of the hedge, then
voices. Two people were walking down the
field path, within a few feet of me, evidently
bound for the same direction. An undefinable
feeling of pleasure crossed me as I recognised
Reggie's voice.

Father.'

Well, what is it, old fellow ? Tired, eh ?'

Reggie's legs ache dedful.'

Poor little legs ! No wonder, when they
have been running about all day! Here; climb
up, old man.'

No, sank '00. Reggie too tired to ride gee-gee.'


What, quite used up ? Never mind ; father

will carry Reggie in his arms all the way home.
Is. that comfortable ?'

Were comfortable, sank 'oo,' evidently cuddling
up in sleepy fashion. ' Father sing to
Reggie now.'

Sing you to sleep ? No, that will never do;
wait till we get home. Look at those stars ; are
they not bright ? Don't go to sleep yet, my
boy. Try and talk to father ; poor either is so
.dull.'

So dull,' echoed Reggie in a drowsy voice.

Father has no one but Reggie now. What
-would he do without his little boy, I wonder ?'

He would kye,' very promptly.

Oh, if crying would mend matters, father
would cry an ocean full ; but we can't wash out
-our mistakes in that fashion; there is no blessed
Lethe for us poor human beings. Some of us
have a taste of purgatorial fires in this world.
You love father, don't you, Reg ?'

Reggie loves father dreadfully.'

'That's my own boy! Well. I have you  my
sone blessing out of all the cursed wreck ; so
there is no need for the enemy to blaspheme.'

I was so afraid of hearing more that I put
my fingers in my ears and hurried on. Had I
done wrong to listen ? and yet how could I have
.avoided it?  only the hedge divided us. Every
.tone of the deep, intense voice seemed to vibrate

almost painfully in my ears ; the chord of hopeless
sadness underlying the fatherly tenderness
was distinctly audible to me. At the words
Father has only Reggie now ' there was a sigh,
long-drawn and pitiful, as though an open grave
were yawning before his eyes.

The tears sprang to my own as I heard it ;
he was so young to be so sorely tried. As I
hurried down the narrow winding lane, I remembered
a gate opened into the field: probably
they would come through it. In my eagerness
to avoid an embarrassing rencontre so far from
home, I walked on quickly and heedlessly.
The dusk was confusing ; the high over-hanging
hedges made it still darker.

I was vexed at my own carelessness in having
wandered so far from home, and afraid that
Aunt Catherine would soon become anxious at
my delay ; and this mixture of emotions absorbed
my thoughts, and I stumbled on blindly.
The next minute I struck against a stone, and
my foot doubled up under me. The sudden
pain told me what had happened  it was a
slight sprain.

I sat down on the fallen log of a tree not far
from the gate to recover myself, until the pain
subsided. It was not a pleasant state of
things. Granted that the sprain was not a
severe one, it was still sufficient to retard my
VOL. I. 18

progress. I got up and tried to stand. Yes, it
was possible ; I could limp along pretty fairly.
But if the pain got worse ? The ankle was
swelling, too. I sat down again, and unfastened
my boot with difficulty ; this gave me a little
ease, and I determined to make a fresh start
Nil desperado,' as Jem used to say.

At this moment footsteps approached the
gate  it was unlatched. I could just see a tall
dark figure turn into the lane. It would have
to pass me, but I determined to take no notice.
I had some flowers in my lap, and I busied
myself with them, hoping that in the dusk he
would not be able to recognise me. I thought
he was about to stop, but he evidently thought
better of it, and walked on rather slowly.

I was unwilling to be left alone in the gathering
darkness, so I thought I would follow them.
Even the sense of their nearness would be
company ; but I got up too quickly, and was
obliged to sit down again with a suppressed
groan. In a moment the footsteps came back.

Have you hurt yourself Can I help you
in any way ?' asked a voice anxiously.

I thought it was impossible that he could
recognise me. He evidently thought he was
addressing a stranger.

I struck against a stone just now, and I fear
I have sprained my ankle ; it is not very bad



and I shall be able to walk directly ; but I got
up too quickly.'

Why, it is the lady from La Maisonnette !'
he returned with some surprise. ' It was too
dark to recognise you. Reggie, wake up ; this
is your friend.'

Is it the smiling lady, father ?' asked Reggie
in a very sleepy voice.

That is what the rogue always calls you ;
but I am truly sorry for your misfortune.' How
very friendly and kind his voice sounded !
though it was impossible to read his expression.
I could barely see the outline of his features.
I am afraid you are in pain,' and then he added
rather impatiently, * I want to be of use ; but it
is so confoundedly dark under these trees that
I cannot see how to help you. It is much
lighter further on.'

Please do not trouble about me,' I returned
hastily ; ' my foot is better now, and I think I
can manage to walk. Reggie is so tired, and
I know it is time for him to be in bed. You
must not let me detain you.'

A short laugh answered me.

Do you think that is the way that Reggie
and I mean to prove our neighbourliness  to
pass by on the other side ? and especially as we
have to thank you for two or three kindly
services  by bringing my naughty runaway back,

182

for example, on that terribly hot afternoon.
Now please tell me how I am to help you. I
can easily carry Reggie on one arm and give
you the other ;' and as though he read my
hesitation aright, he continued more earnestly :
Indeed, I am very strong, and the boy Is no
weight at all. Put your arm round father's
neck, Reggie, and hold tight. That's right, boy.
Now, then, let me see how you can stand ;' and
the next moment a strong hand assisted me to
rise. ' Come, that Is capital ! Can you put
your foot to the ground ?'

Yes  I think so,' making the attempt carefully.
' Of course It hurts, and I shall have to
walk very, very slowly; but I do not think It Is
a severe sprain.'

I am glad to hear It  now  Miss  Miss 
oh, I forgot !' with a slightly nervous laugh ; ' but
will you take my arm, please, and just use meas
a crutch.'

My name Is Leigh,' I returned, as I
obeyed.

Oh, Aunt Catherine, what would you say to
see me now? but necessity knows no laws. We
moved along slowly, and there was silence fora
minute or two, and then my companion said
very kindly :

How are you getting on, Miss Leigh ? Does
it hurt much ? Excuse me, but you are not

making sufficient use of me. I am afraid I am
not much assistance, after all.'

Oh yes, you are, thank you, and the pain is
not very bad. How your arm must ache, carrying
Reggie ! He is asleep, is he not ?'

Fast asleep, poor little beggar ! We have
been too far this evening, and I have tired him
out ; he is such a plucky little chap that one
forgets what a baby he is.'

He is a darling,' I returned, half under my
breath, but my remark was overheard.

I don't think there are many children of his
age like him. You would not believe how
sensible he is, and such a companion ! Perhaps
I am not impartial,' and I could feel he was
smiling ; ' but he is just perfect in my eyes.'

I was about to answer ; but my foot came in
contact with another loose stone, and I gave a
little cry of pain. He stopped at once.

Oh dear ! I am afraid that was my fault.
Will you wait just a moment, and I will shift
the boy to the other arm, and then I can help
you much better ? Now then, lean all your
weight on me. Don't be scrupulous. Miss
Leigh. I am a tower of strength. We are
getting on famously, and every footstep is
bringing us nearer home. Does talking worry
you ? Would you rather have me hold my
tongue ?'

 No  talk, please I replied faintly, for my
foot was pretty bad now ; ' it will make me
forget the pain a lite. Talk about Reggie 
anything.'

You are very brave,' in a grave, pitying
voice ; ' I did not think a girl  I beg your
pardon, a young lady  could be so brave. Do
you see that twinkling light ? that is where my
landlord, Monsieur Perrot, lives. What a droll
old fellow he is ! Madame, his wife, matches
him in drollery  they are a curious couple

Are they ?'

They are interesting from a psychological
point of view. Monsieur Perrot is a consummate
egoist ; his ego is the central point in
creation; everything revolves round it  *' C'est
moi : acres nous la deluge " is stamped ineffaceably
on every word and action.'

He seems to me a stupid, fat old man, and
oh ! so ugly.'

His stupidity and egoism are synonymous
terms ; to me it is a grand denseness. Few
people have a genius for creating their own fog.
Imagine the serenity of a human being who
dwells in a moral atmosphere so thick that no
hostile criticism, no unkind opinion, can penetrate
it. Fog !  I have used a wrong metaphor :
it is more like the rhinoceros' hide, invulnerable
to the sharpest dart. When I think of all



this I could bring myself to envy Monsieur
Perrot, in spite of his stupidity, his stoutness,
and, as I think you added, his ugliness.'

You are a philosopher.'

Pardon me, I am nothing of the kind ; a
philosopher is not an impatient, irritable sort of
mortal, is he ? Perhaps I love to rail on all
mankind, like our friend the melancholy Jaques.
Are you a student of Shakespeare, Miss
Leigh ?'

My brother Jem reads it to me sometimes.
Would you mind waiting a moment, Mr. ?'

I see, we have not been properly introduced
not according to the golden rules of Mrs.
Grundy  so I may as well tell you my name is
Fleming. There is a wall behind you, if you
like to lean upon it ; but I can tell you for your
comfort that we have not much farther to

go.'

Are you sure of that ? oh, I am so thankful !'
but my voice was very faint.

His only answer was to kneel down in the
dusty road and gently lift the suffering foot, and
place his hand under it as a support.

This will give you a moment's ease from
the strain  I can tell from your voice what you
are feeling ; without some relief you will turn
faint, and we have still this long road to La
Maisonnette. If you were not afraid to be left

alone in this dark road, I would run on and get
you some help  may I ? I should not be ten
minutes away. Are you afraid ?'

No  o ; if  if you will be back soon,' but it
was the biggest fib I ever told in my life.

THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF.

This is not a man to be driven from his temperament without
some sufficient cause.'

The Monastery'

I do not take offence easily.'

Rob Roy:

My unpleasant sensations told me that Mr.
Fleming was right (how strange he should
have that name !). A horrible feeling of sickness
was creeping over me, and but for the
relief his strong hand was giving, I could
hardly have borne the pain. To my surprise,
however, he did not move.

Are you not going .' I asked, a minute
later.

No, certainly not ; I must stay now.'

But why ?'

As though you do not know ; do you always
tell fibs, Miss Leigh . your shaky '' No" was
decidedly one just now. You are horribly

afraid at the idea of being left alone for ten
minutes ; I am sorry for it, because I should
like to spare you any more suffering, but what
can I do? If I dared, I would put Reggie
down and carry you to La Maisonnette, but 1
dare not run the risk  he might wake up and
be frightened, or a vehicle might pass with a
driver the worse for cider.'

'Mr. Fleming! as though I would permit
such a thing !'

I am afraid I should not wait for your permission,
if it were the thing to do ; but the fact
is, I do not dare. Now, will you make one
more attempt, for Reggie's sake ?  he is so
uncomfortable on my shoulder.'

I am sure now that he said it to rouse me, for
Reggie was sleeping most sweetly ; but if this
were his intention he succeeded, and in another
minute I was limping along to the best of my
ability, in spite of shooting pain and growing
faintness. Mr. Fleming kept up a ceaseless
flow of talk, but I was no longer capable of intelligent
interest. I seemed to hear disconnected
sentences in a sort of dream, then
detached words : ' the farm ;' ' take care ;' ' a
ditch there ;' ' a lanthorn at the gate ;' ' looking
out ;' ' sensible people ;' then I was dimly
conscious that I was more tightly held ;
a light flashed in my face, and, ' Oh, OJga,

my poor child !' in Aunt Catherine's pitying
tones ; and then for a moment I knew no
more.

When I regained complete consciousness I
was lying on the couch in our pretty little salon,
and Aunt Catherine was beside me. Reesfie
was curled up, still fast asleep, on an opposite
couch, and Mr. Fleming was walking across
the room with a glass of water.

Oh, I am all right now,' I said feebly ; ' it
was only the pain. Aunt Catherine, please
thank Mr. Fleming ; he has been so good tome
; he must have had a miserable time of it.'

Not quite so miserable as you had ;' but I
noticed he looked rather pale and tired as he
spoke. ' Miss Leigh has behaved like a
heroine : I never saw greater pluck. Now
your foot must be attended to at once, so I will
wish you good-night.'

He bowed, and was about to withdraw ; but
I put out my hand impulsively, and Aunt
Catherine followed my example.

I do indeed thank you,' she said very warmly ;
and then I asked if 1 might kiss Reggie, and
Mr. Fleming brought him to me at once.

Aunt Catherine did not harass me with questions
when we were left alone ; she rang for
Jeanne to assist me to my room, and after
fomenting the inflamed and swollen ankle most

tenderly, she bandaged it as skilfully as a
trained nurse would have done.

It was only when I was comfortably in bed,
and enjoying some Sandwiches and a glass of
delicious lemonade, that she drew from me an
account of my accident, and listened with the
deepest interest.

It was quite an adventure, Olga,' she said
when I had finished. ' But, my dear, you have
given me an hour of terrible anxiety ; I have
been walking up and down the lane, and Jeanne
has been standing at the gate I do not know
how long. If you had been ten minutes later I
should have gone round to Monsieur Perrot for
assistance.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, I am so sorry ! But
indeed I never meant to go so far, and creeping
home after this fashion has taken me such a
time.'

Well  well, I will not scold you ; yOu have
been punished enough. If it had not been for
our neighbour you would have fared badly. I
think I shall write a proper little note of thanks
in the morning, and tell him how you are, or he
will be calling to inquire. What did you say
his name was  not Fleming, surely ?' and her
voice changed a little.

Yes, it is Fleming ; do you think it is any
relation ?'

 . 

Certainly not she returned promptly. ' He
Is no relation of Robert Fleming  if that is
what you mean. I recollect his telling me that
he had no one belonging to him in the world,
except an old uncle, and his name was Faber.'

It is very strange !' I persisted.

I do not know why you should say so ;
Fleming is not such an uncommon name, is it ?
I knew some people who called themselves the
Cough-Flemings. Oh yes ; and there was a
Mrs. Samuel Fleming, too ; it is a name I like
very much ;' and Aunt Catherine played thoughtfully
with the fringe of the quilt as she spoke.

After a moment she began again :

I think on the whole our neighbour behaved
very well, Olga. He is a gentleman; I liked
his voice and manner exceedingly.'

Oh yes ; and he was so kind. He was
not a bit stiff really, when he saw I was in
trouble.'

I wonder if I have ever seen him before  I
mean in England ; his face did not seem quite
strange to me.'

Nor to me either ; how funny !'

No, not funny. The world is not so large,
after all, and one stumbles upon people in all
sorts of unexpected places. He is not handsome
; I am not quite sure I like his face : his
eyes are a little cold, and I should judge from

his mouth that he has a temper. When you
see him close he Is not so very young, after all.'

How do you mean ?' for I was not quite
pleased with all this criticism. Mr. Fleming
had been so kind, so considerate, that It did not
seem quite fair to him.

Well, he might be seven or eight and
twenty  even more. There is a worn look
about him that hardly belongs to youth.
Depend upon It, he has known trouble.'

As though I were not as sure of that as
Aunt Catherine ; but I was not going to repeat
what I had heard. Could I ever forget those
bitter, half-mocking words : * There is no blessed
Lethe for us poor human beings ; some of us
have a taste of purgatorial fires in this world,'
followed by that broken, ' I have you, my one
blessing out of all this cursed wreck '? That
tone of utter hopelessness  what could it mean?

Aunt Catherine bade me good-night after
this, and I was glad to be left to my own
thoughts. The remedies had Qiven me relief,
and I was now in tolerable comfort ; but all
the same, sleep seemed to have forsaken me.
I tossed restlessly and feverishly on my pillow,
now recalling the incidents of the past evening,
and now perplexing myself with curious conjectures
on the subject of our mysterious neighbour.
He was a perfect stranger. I had only

just learned his name, and yet I felt a profound
interest in him  his loneliness, his melancholy,
his strange, reckless words, and the wonderful
affection that seemed to subsist between him and
his boy, had somehow stirred the quick sensibilities
of my nature. How kind and helpful
he had proved himself on an emergency ! Most
men of his age would have been either awkward
and embarrassed, or else they would have
presumed and grown familiar ; but I could not
but own that his behaviour had been perfect.
In a moment he had put me at my ease, by
the way he seemed to forget himself in his
anxiety to be of service. Only the truest
good-breeding and an innately kind heart could
have taught him such unselfish courtesy.

If I could only do something for him in
return !' I thought, as I lay looking out into the
starry darkness, while the night breeze, perfumed
with the odour of flowers, stole in at the
open window. ' If only Aunt Catherine, dear
thing that she is, were not such a stickler for
propriety ! if she would only make friends with
him and find out why he is so unhappy ! Why
is it wrong, I wonder, to be kind and companionable
with our neighbours, even if they
be strangers. I think the world is a stupid
place, after all. I suppose we shall be obliged
to know all sorts of people in heaven.'

I suppose my midnight philosophy was not
particularly wholesome, for Aunt Catherine
shook her head when she saw me the next
morning.

You will just have to stay where you are
for the rest of the day,' was the only consolation
she gave me ; ' your bad night has made
you look like a ghost. As I am going down to
St. Croix this morning, I shall ask Dr. Addison
to look at your foot.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine, do you think that is
necessary ? it is not a severe sprain ; you said
so yourself last night.'

No ; but you have aggravated it by that
long walk, and it is as well to be on the safe
side. Why, Olga, you look ready to cry !
Surely one day in your room is not such a
terrible punishment.'

I am so vexed at my own stupid carelessness,
and it is such a lovely day,' I grumbled ;
think how delicious the shore would be this
morning !'

'You may just leave the shore alone, and go
sleep instead,' was her unsympathizing answer.
I don't see why Rollo need be a prisoner, too,
so I shall take him as my escort. Good-bye,
you tiresome child ;' but I detained her.

Shall you write that note, Aunt Catherine ?'

Well, I don't know,' dubiously ; ' our neighbour

has been already to inquire. He came
before I was down, and as Jeanne knew
nothing about your bad night, she had not
much to tell him, so he left his compliments and
went away.'

I think a note would only be civil. We
hardly said anything to him last night !'

Well, I will see about it when I come back,
for I have not a moment to spare now. I must
be at the market early to get you some fruit ;
and there is Dr. Addison and a hundred other
things ;' and then she called Rollo and left me.

I spent the morning in sleep. When Dr.
Addison examined my foot he prescribed a
simple remedy and a few days' rest.

You will not be able to run about for a week
or two,' he said  he was a nice old man, and
spoke in a sort of fatherly way  ' but there is no
need to keep you a prisoner. Get someone to
carry you out in the garden, or in a day or two
you might have a drive. Fresh air will do you
good, and we must not make an invalid of you !'

I felt quite cheered by this sensible prescription,
and when Aunt Catherine returned to my
room she told me that she and Jeanne had discovered
an old wheeled chair in an outhouse.

So there will be no difficulty at all,' she went
on, ' in carrying out Dr. Addison's advice.
Jeanne can wheel you into the shade, and we

VOL. I. 9

can make up a sort of impromptu couch with
two or three chairs. And in a day or two you
shall have a drive

May I go into the garden to-day ?'
No, not to-day. Dr. Addison thinks you
will be better where you are ;' for I was lying
comfortably outside my bed. Then she said, in
rather a hesitating manner : * There was no
need for that note, after all, Olga. I encountered
Mr. Fleming in the market, and he
walked back with me. He saw I was somewhat
laden with the fruit, so he at once offered
to assist me. I found him very good company ;
he seems well read and full of information.
We talked a good deal about Oxford ; he is an
Exeter man.'

Did he say whether he had any profession ?'
I asked eagerly.

Xo ; he is singularly reticent. It was quite
by accident he mentioned Exeter. '* When I
was there," he said, " in my undergraduate

days " and then he stopped, and spoke of

something else directly ; but he talks exceedingly
well.'

Did you like the look of him better this
morning ? was my next question.

I have never disliked the look of him,' she
returned ; ' but his face somehow baffles me.
He has such a cold expression until he smiles,

and then his features seem to Hight up. It is
not a happy face, Olga ; there are such bitter
lines round the mouth. But I confess he
interests me.'

And me also.'

Yes, I know ; but we must be careful.
There is one thing about him that I like  he
certainly does not presume ; indeed, I have
a suspicion that he does not wish for our
acquaintance. But that may be my fancy.'

Purely fancy, I should say.'

Something in my tone seemed to strike Aunt
Catherine, for she closed the subject abruptly,
by showing me the basket of fruit and flowers
she had brought ; and I was too much touched
by her thoughtful kindness to say anything
more about Mr. Fleming.

An hour later I was lying with my eyes
closed, thinking of Kitty and the children,
when the door softly opened; and Rollo's tail
beoan to waq in a friendly fashion. The next
moment something warm and soft darted at me,
and Reggie scrambled up upon my bed.

Take care of my poor foot ! Oh, you
darling ! Who brought you ?' and I nearly
smothered him with kisses.

Reggie took them as a matter of course ;
he was used to being loved. He had two or
three clover-stalks in his hot hand.

19  2

Reggie has picked you f powers,' he said
proudly.

But who brought you, my sweet ?'

Lady brought Reggio he replied promptly :
and then I knew Aunt Catherine had contrived
this little surprise for me.

Reggie seemed mystified by my apparent
laziness. He wanted me to get up and play
with him, and when I explained matters he
insisted Rollo should come up too ; so we were
all of a heap together. I told him stories at
last to keep him quiet. I recollect one was
about a little white, downy owl with round
yellow eyes, who lived with her children in an
ivy-bush. I regret to say that Reggie repeated
this tale under the title of ' the howl
what lives in the ivy-bush,' and he was so
much pleased with it that when I had finished
he wanted me to begin it all over again.
Reggie stayed with me some time, and was
as good as possible. He went away reluctantly
when Jeanne came to fetch him.

Monsieur son pere was standing at the little
gate, and had requested that le petit should be
brought to him.

I raised myself up when Jeanne had left the
room. Yes, I could see the gray cap between
the branches ; he was standing by the hammock
waiting for his boy.

Reggie has forgotten father,' I could hear
him say, as the Httle figure bounded along the
gravel walk, and then Reggie sprang into his
father's arms with a merry laugh.

The next morning I was carefully wheeled
by Jeanne into my favourite grove, and there
I spent the rest of the day, and many succeeding
days, very happily with my work and books.
Reggie was my constant companion; every
afternoon, exactly at the same time, he would
come running down the little path and call tome
to open the gate. If Aunt Catherine were
absent, I had to summon Jeanne. Mr. Fleming
never made his appearance ; once I caught
sight of him in the distance, but he never
obtruded himself.

Reggie would play happily for hours. At
first he could not understand why I would not
play hide-and-seek with him and Rollo. He
would run away and hide, and presently I
would hear his dear little voice calling me ; but
I had to send Rollo instead. Once he called
so long and so imploringly that Aunt Catherine
accompanied Rollo.

Look at Reggie !' he cried triumphant.
Reggie is Mrs. Howl in the ivy-bush.'

Sometimes he lay contentedly in the hammock
while I told him fresh stories. He did
not care for tales about good lite boys or

THE SEARCH FOR BASIL LYNDHURST

girls, but a story about a squirrel, a mouse, ora
rabbit instantly commanded his attention.

Ah, ah! Mr. Bunny,' he would say, 'Mr.
Fox found you out. Go on, my dear ;' for this
was the patronizing phrase he had adopted forme.
I suppose he found ' the smiling lady '
too long for ordinary occasions. How Aunt
Catherine laughed when she first heard
him !

What a droll lite creature he is !' she
would say ; but she soon grew excessively
fond of him.

One afternoon, or rather evening, I had my
promised drive, and I enjoyed it so much that
Aunt Catherine told Jules to come daily. I
was sitting in the fiacre one evening, waiting
for Aunt Catherine to come out, when I saw
Mr. Fleming coming up the lane. He was
walking rather wearily, and Reggie was running
on before him.

Of course Reggie recognised me with a
shout ; but as I leant over the side of the
fiacre to warn him from coming too close, Mr.
Fleming came up hurriedly and lifted him out
of harm's way ; and then he could not do less
than speak to me.

I am glad to see you out again. Miss
Leigh,' he said rather gravely, and I understood
why Aunt Catherine thought his face

cold, for there was not the gleam of a smile on
it. ' 1 am afraid you have had a trying time
lately.'

Oh no,' I replied rather timidly, for his
manner did not put me at my ease, and he did
not seem in the least pleased to see me. ' I
have been out in the garden all day, and you
have been kind enough to spare Reggie to mea
good deal, so I have not been dull.'

Then his face did relax a little.

There is no keeping Reggie away ; you and
Miss Seton have spoiled him. He is always
wanting to come to you.'

I have not kissed my Dear,' observed
Reggie, in such a sentimental tone that we
both burst out laughing, and after that he
could not quite stiffen up again. But this
friendly mood was brief.

The next minute Aunt Catherine came out
of the house. She seemed pleased to see Mr.
Fleming, and shook hands with him as he
helped her into the carriage. But he responded
in the briefest manner to her pleasant speech,
and, taking Reggie's hand, walked on.

Aunt Catherine looked after him thoughtfully.


Had you been talking long to Mr. Fleming,
Olga ?'

No ; only three or four minutes. He did

not seem quite like himself ; he was rather cool
in his manner

I was thinking the same myself. One cannot
help being civil, of course ; but if you take
my advice you will say as little as possible to
Mr. Fleming. Any attention on our part
seems to embarrass him. For some reason or
other, he certainly does not mean to know us.
I never saw any other young man so reserved,
and with whom it was so difficult to get
on.'

I was too much chagrined at Mr. Fleming's
coolness to contradict her. And yet how different
he had been that evening ! But it was
no use thinking of that.

In a week's time I was able to hobble about
a little ; but it was some days after that I
went down to the shore for the first time since
my accident. Aunt Catherine had letters to
write as usual  to her lawyer, her bailiff, and
to one of her tenants  indeed, she had business
to occupy her until luncheon. The morning
was sultry and sunless, and Aunt Catherine
begged me not to go . farther than the llltle
bathing-house, as she thought a storm was
threatening, and as my opinion coincided with
hers, I readily promised to follow her Injunction.


The hour that followed was not entirely enjoyable.

I was oppressed by the stillness and
airlessness of the atmosphere. The bay had
a leaden, oily aspect. I was peculiarly susceptible
to any sombre influences, and I was
conscious of a sense of heaviness as I looked
out on my favourite scene, as though I were regarding
a dear friend under sinister circumstances.


By-and-by a few heavy drops warned me.
As I put up my sketching materials hastily,
they fell faster and faster. As I could only
walk slowly, I was slightly damp before I had
unlocked the door of the bathing-house and
had taken refuge In the tiny room.

A moment later I heard hasty footsteps ;
someone was dashing up the steep little path
leading to our common. To my surprise It was
Mr. Fleming, with Reggie, as usual, on his
shoulder. Out of sheer humanity, for the
thunder-shower was very heavy, I begged him
to enter ; and without a moment's hesitation he
accepted my invitation, and, depositing Reggie
on the wooden table, began rubbing him down
with his handkerchief, while Reggie comported
himself like a frisky lite pony.

Thank you so much for this shelter, Miss
Leigh,' he said quite cordially. ' I actually
dashed past the open door without seeing it
until you called me. I am thankful for

Reggie's sake, for I don't mind a wetting myself;
but he is such a delicate little fellow.'

Oh, I hope he has taken no harm,' for his
sailor suit felt a little damp.

Oh no, the rain will soon be over ; it is too
violent to last. Will you not sit down, Miss
Leigh ? I see you still walk rather lamely ;'
and he brought me one of the wooden chairs,
and took the other himself.

Mr. Fleming's manner had decidedly thawed
since our last meeting. Perhaps he considered
it was his duty lo entertain me in return for my
hospitality ; for he began talking about the
book he had under his arm, and asked if I had
read it. I forget its title, but he gave me a
rdsumd of the contents, and criticised it in a
masterly fashion. I wished Aunt Catherine
could have heard him. After that, he sat looking
down at the bay, while Reggie played at
his feet with Rollo.

Isn't that grand, Miss Leigh ?' he said presently.
' I do like looking at a large expanse
of water ; it gives me such a sense of freedom.'

There was a strange intensity in his expression
as he watched the dark water and the
driving rain, and some impulse made me say :

You speak as though freedom were the chief
blessing to be desired in life.'

So it is,' he answered short, and his eyes

were still fixed on the bay ; * there is nothing to
compare with it in my opinion ; and yet how few-men
are really free !'

How do you mean, Mr. Fleming ?'

He turned round and gave me a quick searching
glance, as though my question disturbed him.

'Oh, it is not easy to explain my meaning;'
and there was a tinge of impatience in his voice.
There is very little freedom in this world, after
all. It is a little hard, is it not ? that some have
to pay a life-long penalty for some youthful
error ; but so it is.' He sighed, and drew
Reoeie between his knees : and as the child
looked up in his face, his expression softened.
Never mind, Reg, old fellow. Freedom is a
sweet sort of mistress ; but I would not take
her in exchange for you.'

I thought it better to change the subject
by saying I hoped the rain would soon be over,
as Aunt Catherine would be getting anxious
at my delay.

Oh, I hope not,' he returned, going to the
door ; ' you gave her anxiety enough the other
evening. Miss Seton is your aunt, is she not,
Miss Leigh ?'

He certainly looked mystified when I explained
that she was no relation.

But you call her Aunt Catherine,' he
persisted.

Oh, that is only our pet name for her. Jem
calls her that, too. Jem is my brother, Mr.
Flemings, and we both live with a married
brother, who is a clergyman. Aunt Catherine 
Miss Seton I mean  is only a neighbour, and
she lives with her sister, Mrs. Lyndhurst, at a
beautiful place close by  Brookfield Hall. They
are such dear creatures, the Ladies, as we call
them, and we are so fond of them.'

Yes, I see,' and his manner betrayed some
interest ; ' these adopted relationships are often
very close  sometimes as close as real flesh and

blood ones. I knew of a case once ' then

he stopped abruptly.

'You knew of a case once, Mr. Flemings' 1
repeated, as a sort of encouragement to him to
proceed, but he returned quickly :

Oh, it is nothing ; it would not interest you
in the least !'

I believe you think nothing interests us,' I
replied, rather piqued at this sudden reticence.
I mean'  for he looked perplexed at this 
at least, Aunt Catherine says that she is sure
you do not want to have anything to do with
us ; that you would rather not, in fact.'

I blushed with annoyance the moment I
made this impulsive speech. I could not think
what made me say such a thing ; but somehow
his manner provoked me so, it was so cool and

guarded, just as though he were on his defence
against us  as though we were his natural
enemies. I am sure at that moment that I
dished him heartily.

To my surprise he answered me with the
utmost gentleness.

Why do you say that ?' he replied, almost
as though he were speaking to Reggie. ' Why
should you think me so ungrateful ? It is not
right to misjudge anyone. What if I do not
consider myself worthy of your acquaintance ?
What you think an unbecoming reserve may be
only my way of showing my respect.'

Mr. Fleming,' I stammered, ' is it because
you are poor that you do not consider yourself
our equal ?'

Then he smiled.

No, Miss Leigh ; I am too much of a philosopher
to fear comparison of that sort. My
poverty is an extraneous circumstance that has
nothing to do with me ; but you are wrong.
Though I do not seek acquaintance, I take a
great deal of interest in the kind ladies who are
so good to my boy. There, the rain is over.
Do you think we may venture now ?'

Oh yes ; I think so.'

My cheeks were burning. How gently, yet
with what dignity, he had rebuked my rudeness!
He was not even vexed with me for my presumption.

As we went out together, and he
followed me up the little path between the dripping
gorse-bushes, he talked in the pleasant
way he had talked that evening ; and when we
parted at the door of La Maisonnette, he held
out his hand for the first time.

Good-bye, Miss Leigh,' he said, with a clear,
open glance of amity. * Please give my compliments
to MissSefton;' and he looked so friendly
that I ventured to say :

I am afraid I have been very rude, Mr.
Fleming. Please forgive me.'

Why, what nonsense !' he said heartily.
I have nothing in the least to forgive ;' and
then he shook hands with me again.

MISS SEFTON's STORY

VOL. II. 20

CATHERINE SEFTON S RETROSPECT.

Seek not much rest, but much patience.'

Thomas a Kempis.

The graves grow thicker, and life's ways more bare,
As years and years go by ;
Nay ! thou hast more green gardens in thy care,

And more stars in thy sky.
Behind, hopes turned to griefs, and joys to memories.

Are fading out of sight ;
Before, pains changed to peace, and dreams to certainties,
Are glowing in God's light'

Lyra Mystic.'

There is one lesson that I think we all learn
better as we grow older, and that is submission
to the discipline of life.

Youth is slow to comprehend the inevitable
laws that govern human existence. They
turn away their eyes with natural reluctance
from the dangers and pitfalls that threaten
their future peace. To-morrow is not to-day ;

20  2

the present, so joyous, so strewn with flowers
that Is sufficient for these thoughtless minds.
Age, with its sad environment, is still far away
in the misty distance  away with all these prophets
of evil. ' Let us eat and drink !' Oh
yes ! is that not their light-hearted philosophy ?

I thank the Fatherly Wisdom above that
such things should be  that these children just
entering upon life are so mercifully blinded, so
pathetically ignorant of the difficulties and
sorrows that will beset their path later on. But
with us who are older it is different. What
woman of forty-five  yes, it is I, Catherine
Seton, who ask the question  what woman of
forty-five can look back on the years of her life
without a sigh of regret, without a repressed
shiver, as the shadows of the past seem to
enfold her ?

Ah I we know now what life means, as we
look back over the years. There was work
that we set about so gladly, so eagerly, and
yet left unfinished ; there were friendships that
had been broken, promises unfulfilled, hopes
that had been frustrated, good intentions that
had come to an untimely end ; those who had
loved us had passed within the veil ; others had
disappointed us ; where we had expected to find
consolation we found vacancy. Who will not
verify these words ? Who has not experienced

this bitter discipline ? Is it not written in the

Food Book, that 'through much tribulation '?

Well, can we not finish that sentence for ourselves
?

But I am no pessimist. Like other women,
I have kept my journal of mercies : I have had
my glad times  my golden opportunities.
When joy fled, Peace  tender and abiding  has
taken me by the hand and led me gently on.
Would you know what she whispered to me at
the hour of my greatest desolation  when I
parted with the man whom I honoured above all
men? ' It is but for a time. This life  this
antechamber, where the grown-up children
learn their lessons ; where they do their painful
tasks ; where the problems they are studying are
not clear to their comprehension  this is but
the beginning  the childhood of life : beyond is
the real life, where all shall be solved, and the
parted shall be reunited for ever.'

I had had much to try me. When I was quite
young the burden of a sister's wrecked happiness
had been laid on me  the daily and hourly
responsibility of helping a weak, morbid nature
to bear a trouble that seemed too heavy for it.
I take no credit to myself for this ; many a
woman has had a like burden, and has borne it
far more bravely than I. I loved Virginia;
she was my only sister ; but I was not always

patient with her. She had wrought her own
woe. There were times when I would speak
strongly to her of the duty of bearing more
cheerfully the penalty of her own weakness.
When I told her that no private grief should
ever shadow the peace of a household, she
would listen to me meekly. ' You are right,
Cathy ; you are always right,' that is what she
would say to me. But the cloud never lifted ;
the next day it would be the same : the old sadness,
the shrinking from strange faces, the want
of interest, the self-absorbed, morbid depression;
no, she could not help it, my poor Virginia ; the
poison had entered into her very being ; her
nature was not strong enough to rally ; she was
simply crushed.

Life could not be very gay at the Hall
under these circumstances, but I had my own
interests. I was proud of bearing an old and
honoured name ; the charge of our estates gave
me plenty of active work ; our tenants, the poor
people round us, the ordering of our household,
and the interchange of civility with our neighbours,
filled up one busy day after another, and
left me no time to think of my own happiness.
If only Virginia would have worked too ! but
she was too spiritless, too much unnerved by
her unhealthy brooding ; after a time I had to
leave her alone.

It has always been my opinion that a single
woman should create her own interests and ties.
I know that my affection for Olga brought
much happiness into my life, and I grew almost
to regard her as my adopted child ; Jem was
very dear to me, too, but he was not Olga.

I never knew any girl like her ! She was not
specially clever, nothing out of the common,
but there was a freshness and sweetness about
her, a sprightly sort of gentleness that entirely
won my heart. Few young girls are restful.
Olga was singularly so; her nature had no
abrupt angles ; there was a wonderful serenity
about her ; she had no moods ; she was always
just herself, simple, affectionate, unselfish.

I think the great secret of her charm lay in
her complete unconsciousness ; she never seemed
to be thinking of other people's opinion ; she
wished to be loved, but she gave herself no
uneasiness on the subject ; her affections were
very strong ; she was capable of any amount of
self-sacrifice for those she loved ! Perhaps her
chief danger lay in her sympathy for others,
her generosity often out-stript her prudence ;
if she could help others, she was willing to run
any risk herself

I remember the little anecdote that Jem once
told me of their childish days ; it was so
characteristic of Olga : she was ready now to

scorch herself in any good cause, to try her
powers, to approach the impossible too closely !
I could fancy her still crying out with childish
petulance, ' Oh ! Jem, it hurts !' for she was one
who could suffer keenly. The one flaw in her
character was a certain difficulty in understanding
lower or more prosaic natures, in
making allowances, in giving out her best to
them ; and yet when she really loved anyone
it was marvellous how she overlooked their
defects, how she gave them credit for fabulous
virtues. I am thinking of Jem, who, after all,
was not more romantic than other young men
of his age.

But with poor Mr. Leigh it was different.
Olga was never entirely just to him ; even Jem
told her so. A certain slowness of comprehension,
a tedious mannerism, a few surface faults,
blinded her to his excellences. I never knew
a better man ; as a clergyman, he was faultless,
and his single-hearted loyalty to his frail, worn
wife was touching beyond measure. To borrow
an oft-used expression, he simply worshipped
the ground she walked on.

I used to scold Olga sometimes when I was
in a lecturing mood. Tt is always, Jem, Jem !'
I said once, ' never Hubert ; and yet what a
good brother he is ! Has he ever said a hard
word to you ?'

No, never she replied quite meekly, tor she
knew she deserved my scolding.

He is good as gold !' I went on ; 'he never
thinks of himself  you have often told me so ;
it is always his wife, or his children, or you, or
Jem ! he is so fond of you both, Olga.'

Yes, I know,' looking very much ashamed
of herself.

'And yet it is always Jem !  oh, I grant you
Jem is charming ; I like him better than any
other young man of my acquaintance. He is a
fine fellow  a very fine fellow  but he is not
better than his elder brother.'

Why should you compare them ?' she asked
reproachfully ; ' they are totally different. Jem
is Jem ; and as for Hubert '

'Well, what about Hubert?'

Oh, he provokes me  he is so dense !  but,
all the same, I am very fond of him. I am not
like Kitty, perhaps, but, then, Kitty is his wife.
If I had a husband I should swear by him, of
course.'

x'\nd then the naughty child went off singing
to herself, just as though I had made no impression
on her ; but I never lost an opportunity of
speaking a good word for Mr. Leigh.

Virginia was very much attached to Olga 
she always said that she was like a sunbeam in
the house. Once or twice, when we were sitting

together in the long winter evenings, she would
drop some word about her that I found it difficult
to answer.

We are growing old, Cathy,' she said once ;
and if we should never find Basil '  and then
she looked at me meaningly  * if we should have
to seek for an heir  and we should have none of
our own flesh and blood  then there is Olga.'

I remember the sudden pang I felt when
she first said this, and how the blood seemed to
rush to my heart for a moment. Had it come
to this ? were we so poor, so deprived of all
natural ties, that we must leave a neighbour to
inherit our lands ? Must the Seftons die out ?
Were we two lonely women the last of our
race ?

We must find Basil,' I returned ; and in
spite of myself my voice faltered.

But Virginia was in one of her dark moods.

Basil may be dead,' she whispered ; and I
shrank a little at her tone. ' How can we find
my boy if they have buried him out of sight ?
We are growing old, Catherine, and who is to
live here in our stead ? is it to be Jem or
Olga ?'

It is to be neither,' I exclaimed ; I know I
answered her with a sort of impatience. ' How
do we know Basil is dead ? and the property is
his. I will not lose the hope of finding him.

You are his mother, Virginia ; it is for you to
hope too.'

I think I am tired of hoping,' she returned,
with a gentleness that simply exasperated me.
 I have hoped so long  and if he should be
dead '

I cannot explain how all this reiteration vexed
me. It was only poor Virginia's way  her
method of tormenting herself; but to-night it
was simply unbearable. I flung away from the
room as that last dreary sentence rang in my
ears  ' If he should be dead !'

Well, it might be so ; Basil might be lying in
his grave ; but for all that, why should it be
Olga  Olga, whom I so dearly loved, but who
was not our own flesh and blood ? We could
remember her ; oh yes, there were other ways
of showing our affection  but what had she
done that this rich inheritance should be hers ?
why should her simple, happy life be spoilt by
all this weight and responsibility ?

It is not for Olga,' I said to myself; 'and
yet to whom could it all go ?' and as I asked
the question, the thought flitted through my
mind  a sudden memory of one who had been
poor all his life, and had done good work with
only a scanty reward ; who had toiled and
grown gray in his Master's service, without
asking for His good things. Would not wealth

be of infinite use to such a one ?  a talent, a
glorious talent, to be spent for others ; would
not hundreds be benefited, as well as he ?

I went about with this thought locked up in
my breast for many a day, but I never spoke of
it to anyone. Now and then Virginia would
revert to the old subject  ' If he should be
dead but I always soothed her with the hope
of a living Basil.

There was plenty of time ; by-and-by, in a
year or two, I might speak another name, that
had not been mentioned between us for five-and-twenty
years. Would Virginia think me mad ?
would she again plead Olga's cause ? Time
would show. Meanwhile the thought soothed
me ; perhaps one day it might all belong to
Robert Fleming. It made me happier to think
of this, and how he would care for all our
poor people. Perhaps he might even take
the name of Seton, to please his long-lost
friend.

I know few young persons would give a
middle-aoed woman credit for such romance ;
but the heart is slow in growing old, and I had
a tenacious memory. I could have married
over and over again, but I had never seen a
man to compare with Robert. 'If it be not
Robert, it will be no one,' I had cried to my
father with passionate girlish despair ; but he

had answered with an incredulous smile. Well,
I had been right  it was no one.

Sometimes, when Olga looked at me in the
innocent way that was natural to her, my whole
heart seemed to go out to the child, but, all the
same, I would say to myself:

I am not wronging her  there will be plenty
for her and Jem. She will not misjudge me,
because when I had the power to make her a
rich woman I withheld my hand  because I
selected a faithful steward, and kept it all for
him.'

No ; I was not afraid of Olga. There was
nothing mercenary in her nature ; she loved us
and was grateful to us for our kindness, but
no speculation on the future ever entered her
thoughts.

I was in this unsettled state of mind when the
report reached us of Paul Lyndhurst's death.
It came to us in a strange, roundabout way,
and was terribly vague and unsatisfactory. He
had been dead for years, but no one knew of the
fact but a certain Pere Lefevre, one of the
clergy of I'Eglise de St. Sulpice at St. Genette.

Our hopes of ever finding our rightful heir
Basil had by this time ebbed very low indeed,
but as this faint clue reached us, it was wonderful
how they revived again. When Virginia
looked in my face with yearning eyes, but

without speaking, I knew what the words were
that she left unuttered :

You will go to St. Genette and see Pere
Lefevre. Perhaps on his death-bed Paul may
have mentioned his son ;' and I answered as
though she had really spoken :

Yes ; I will go

In my own heart, I was glad that any action
was possible ; all these years there had been
nothing that I could do. How could I have
left Virginia to search for Basil ? But now.
when she bade me m, I could leave her with a

o

clear conscience.

But I did not know what need there would
be of patience, or of the long weeks of waiting
that lay before us. At first I chafed sadly at
the delay, but a letter from Virginia reassured
me.

Yes, it is hard,' she wrote ; ' but I am used
to disappointment ; and you must not trouble
so much about me. It is needless to say how
I miss you  the faithful sister who has become
a necessity to me ; but though the Hall is
empty without you, Cathy, I would not have
you back for worlds. Stay where you are, and
let us both try to be patient. You have Olga ;
the dear child will not let you be dull. No ;
you must not come back until you can bring me
word that I am a free woman, and that Basil 

ah ! I dreamt of him last night : he held out his
hand, and said '' Mother," and I woke weeping
for the very sweetness of the dream.'

After this I banished all uneasy scruples, and
tried to enjoy our pleasant unconventional life.

I began to love La Maisonnette almost as
much as Olga did. I liked our cosy salon, and
the great bare salle-manger, with its open
glass doors and shady coolness. Sometimes,
as we sat at our meals, the chickens would peck
at the crumbs beside us ; Rollo used to watch
them furtively, and growl from time to time,
but he never dared to chase them away  only
Jeanne would come clattering over the floor,
and drive them off with loud protestations.

One might as well dine in the poultry-yard !'
she would say, with a toss of her head, as one
cackling chicken after another fled into the
courtyard. ' Poof ! it makes one hot, too  the
aggravating fowls !'

I must confess our neighbour at the pavilion
interested me greatly, though I tried to hide
this feeling from Olga. Indeed, it was for her
sake solely that I did not make any overtures
towards intimacy.

A girl is a serious responsibility, especially
a warm-hearted, impulsive creature like Olga,
who was capable of setting Mrs. Grundy at
defiance if she could only perform a kind

action to a fellow-creature. In spite of her
innate refinement, one found it very difficult
to make her understand the little niceties and
adjustments that are necessary in our intercourse
with the other sex ; her very innocence
and kindness of heart made her bolder than
other girls, and her unconsciousness added to
the danger.

Judge my dismay, then, at finding an interesting
young widower located at our very back-door
 a widower, too, under very questionable
circumstances, and evidently as poor as a
church-mouse. Unknown to Olga, I had questioned
Monsieur Perrot about his lodger, but
his replies had been very unsatisfactory.

Monsieur was poor, certainly ; he had affirmed
the fact. He  Monsieur Perrot  was standing
one evening at his door talking to madame, and
cet jeune monsieur had addressed him. Madame
Ravished to know how long ago. Well, perhaps
a month or five weeks  a few days before
madame had come to La Maisonnette.

Not longer ao than that ?'

Mais non, certainement ; madame could
verify the fact, for she came out and kissed le
petit, who was asleep in monsieur's arms.
Madame thought it was his little brother, but
monsieur only smiled and shook his head.
Then they had got into conversation, and

monsieur stated that he was looking for a
lodging  some quiet place that was not too
dear. Monsieur owned his poverty frankly :

I have only a little,' he said in a bright sort
of way ; ' when I have spent that, our holiday
will be over. I want it to last as long as possible
and then he had frowned as though some uneasy
thought troubled him.

And you offered him the pavilion, monsieur?'

Well, it was madame's thought,' he returned,
pushing his old blue velvet cap rakishly over
one ear. ' She had fallen in love with le
petit, and, indeed, he was a little angel of
beauty.'

If one might put a few things in the
pavilion,' she said, and monsieur had caught at
the notion at once. It was dirty and full of
litter ; but, all the same, nothing had suited him
so well.

It is a hermitage,' he cried  'a lodge In a
garden of cucumbers. Look at that sunset 
those windows looking out on the apple-trees.*
Ma foi, monsieur was easily contented. He
and madame bargained over matters like two
children  like chattering magpies. There must
be a bed ; as for a bath, there was the bay ; buta
table, even some chairs, were necessary. A
stove  good ; he would have excellent coffee.
The bread and the milk for le petit  nothing

VOL. II. 2

was wanting. Dinner could be had at a
restaurant. It would be a life after his own heart.

 Wake up, Reggie, and see thy new abode
the other edition of the old curiosity shop.'

Oh, it was droll to hear him, and to see le petit
clap the hands ! How interesting Olga would
have found all this ! but I dared not tell her. I
dared not excite her sympathy and pity by
describing the poor fellow's boyish transport at
the sight of the bare-looking pavilion. There
was a touch of poetry in those few words :
Look at that sunset'  as though he habitually
lived above his surroundings.

We are ourselves in spite of our environment,'
he had said to me as we walked together
that afternoon from the market-place.

I found it difficult to forcrct that talk. It was
the conversation of a man who had thought
much and suffered much, and whose faith inhumanity
had become impaired. Every now
and then there was a bitter, half-mocking speech
that jarred upon me, as though under the boyish
manner there lurked a hidden depth and undercurrent.
I hardly know how to describe the
impression it made on me. I felt as though I
must take his hand and beg him to be silent :
It is not so. There are yet good people in the
world; high aims, lofty principles. Throw away
this black pessimism, this garbage that no one

wants, and open your eyes to the better side of
life ;' but he was a stranger, and I could not say
this.

He interested me profoundly. Indeed, he
was never out of my thoughts ; but, all the same,
he repelled me. The dark intent face and cold
gray eyes haunted me. I used to ask myself
curiously whether I liked or disliked him ; fora
long time I could not answer this question.
I used to be sorry when Olga met him. The
night of the accident I had an uneasy feeling
when I saw him with her.

Will you take my boy ?' he had said to me
quickly, almost peremptorily; 'Miss Leigh has
hurt her foot and is very faint ;' and then he had
lifted her up as though she were as light as
Reggie, and carried her into the house. ' She
has been very brave, but the pain has been too
much for her,' he said as he went to the sideboard
for cold water.

It struck me then, from his manner, that he
had been used to illness  he was so quiet and
helpful.

But in spite of my old-maidish scruples, there
was no keeping Olga and Reggie apart. The
child had taken a fancy to her. Every day we
heard his little voice shouting to us to open
the gate ; and then he would come bounding
through it, and fling himself into her arms. It

21  2

was SO pretty to see them together ; Olga had
such gentle winning ways with children.

I am sure that it was his gentlemanly instinct
that kept Mr. Fleming at a distance  how
strange he should have that name !  for he was
very grateful to us for our kindness to Reggie ;
but, all the same, he did not wish for any intimacy.
I have seen him avoid us more than
once, or pass us with a bow, and I often begged
Olga to be equally distant.

I was rather amazed, then, when I heard of
the rencontre at the bathing-house ; and still
more so when she repeated her impulsive
speech.

Why am 1 so foolishly outspoken, Aunt
Catherine ?' she asked in quite a piteous voice.
I mean to be so careful, and then the words
somehow escape me. Jem is right  it is my
own fault that 1 get into so many scrapes.'

It is better to think before one speaks,' I
replied with unusual severity ; but really the
child had been so foolish.

To my dismay she suddenly burst into tears.

Oh, I am so ashamed of myself!* she cried ;
'and you say nothing to comfort me. Mr.
Fleming will think  oh ! I do not know what
he will think ; but no one could have been
kinder.'

He will only think that you want to befriends

; your little reproach meant nothing but
that. Mr. Fleming is a man of the world ; he
will not misunderstand a little bit of girlish
pique.'

You are making it worse,' she returned ;
and I could see she was much put out. ' What
business have I to wish to know any gentleman
who shows so much reluctance to know
me ? My pride ought to have prevented me
from making such a speech ; but it was just his
loneliness and unhappiness  oh, I am sure he
is unhappy !  that made me long for us to be
his friends. I thought how much good you
might do him. But there, how often you have
told me not to enact the part of Providence, and
so I have brought this humiliation on myself.'

But it is nothing  a mere nothing, my dear
Olga. How can you exaggerate a few words ?'

It is not a mere nothing to be misunderstood,'
she replied with much dignity. * Aunt
Catherine, why do you not comprehend my
meaning ? I am right to be angry with myself
; I made a foolish speech to a stranger ; I
am glad I asked his pardon for my impertinence
; I am glad he answered me so kindly.
My one hope now is, that I may never have an
opportunity of speaking to Mr. Fleming again ;'
and the dear child marched out of the room
with her pretty little head as erect as possible.

Certainly I was right in saying Olga's impulsiveness
would lead her into trouble. If Mr.
Fleming had not been a gentleman  well, I
know many a man would have taken advantage
of that innocent little speech, and made it the
basis for a lively flirtation.

A STRANGE NIGHT.

Hast thou gone sadly through a dreary night,
And found no light ;
No guide, no star, to cheer thee through the plain 

No friend, save pain ?
Wait, and thy soul shall see, when most forlorn,
Rise a new morn.'

Adelaide Anne Proctor.

The next morning, as we were sitting over
our breakfast and reading our letters, I noticed
that Olga changed colour, and knit her brows
as though something disturbed her.

Is Jem treating you to one of his fraternal
lectures ?' I asked, anxious to find out what
was amiss.

Jem writes rather strangely,' she replied Ina
very low voice. * I think you had better
read what he says ;' and she laid down the
letter before me, and went on with her breakfast.
And then she added, a moment later :

You see, I have always been accustomed to
tell Jem everything. I like him to know all
about my friends, and everyone ; he Is so
sensible and sympathetic. I never knew him
take notions into his head before.'

I made no answer to this. Before I read a
word I understood that Jem disliked the idea
of our new acquaintance, and I was right.
The passage Olga pointed out to me was as
follows :

And now I want to say a word to you, and
I hope Aunt Catherine will excuse my interference.
I think that you ought be very careful
before you pick up new acquaintances in
that outlandish place. You are such a softhearted
goose, Olga, and  begging her pardon
Aunt Catherine Is not exactly what one
would call a woman of the world '  what a rude
boy !  ' and I think you want someone to look
after you both  you two poor unprotected
females ! Now, I do not half like the Idea of
this fellow at the pavilion  what in the world
is a pavilion ?  he does not seem altogether
square. I think you said his name was
Fleming ; try and find out his Christian name.
There was a man of that name at Exeter  before
my time, of course  who was the tip-top of
all the riff-raff there, and who did not bear the

best of characters. I think his name was
Gerard, or Bertram ; I can find out which. He
was confoundedly clever, and all that  that
kind of fellow always is  but he made a mess
of his career by marrying beneath him. I
think the girl was in some shop ; but nobody
knows exactly, only he vanished as though the
earth had swallowed him up. Now, I don't
say this man is your hermit of the pavilion, but
it looks uncommonly like it, and if you will
take my advice you will have very little todo
with him. You may show this to Aunt
Catherine if you like, for she is a sensible
woman, and will not mind my taking the
liberty of cautioning you both. Write again
soon.

Your affectionate brother,

Jem.'

I hardly knew what to say as I handed
the letter back to Olga. It had made me
desperately uncomfortable. I did so hate
suspecting people.

Jem may be right, you know ; he is very
sharp. He has all the meanings of the future
lawyer about him.'

To my alarm, Olga burst out with a passionate
remonstrance.

I call that too bad, Aunt Catherine. You

are condemning Mr. Fleming without proof,
just because Jem chooses to Interfere and make
ridiculous statements. That is quite a version
of '' Give a dog a bad name, and hang him !" '

My dear Olga !'

*Many young men have been wild at
Oxford ; but they have turned out very well
for all that, and he may have repented of his
follies. Why should we refuse to make any
allowances for him ?'

You think, then, that Jem's Mr. Fleming is
the same as ours ?'

It looks very much like it,' she returned
reluctantly. ' You surely remember, Aunt
Catherine, that he told you that he had been at
Exeter ? I am afraid that corroborates it.
He may even have married beneath him '

She stopped and twisted her hands nervously
together. It was a habit of hers when anything
troubled her for which she could find no
reason.

Well, my dear, will you not finish your
sentence ?'

1 hardly know how to explain my meaning.
I am bitterly disappointed to think that Mr.
Fleming could have contracted a low marriage
he seems too refined, too cultured altogether.
But perhaps he was young, and the girl was
pretty ; anyhow, I think we ought to be sorry

for him, for he must have had much to bear.
Perhaps, after all, it is a good thing that his
wife is dead

I thought you would have judged him more
severely.*

I don't seem as though I could find it in my
heart to be hard on him ; he is too unhappy,
Aunt Catherine. I am sure that he has repented
and is sorry ; perhaps that is what he
meant about not being worthy of our friendship.
He may hold himself aloof for that very reason,
and I am to judge him harshly !'

No, Olga, 1 did not say that ; only the world
will turn a cold shoulder on him. A gentleman
has no right to marry beneath him. How
can he expect his friends to be the same to him
afterwards ?'

There may be justifying circumstances,' she
returned firmly, ' or he might have been very
young, Aunt Catherine. Jem may say what
he likes; but he does not know Mr. Fleming.
He has never seen him with Reggie ; if he had,
I don't think he would be quite so hard on
him.'

All the same, he has made me very uncomfortable.'


That is so wrong of him ; and, after all, we
have found out nothing.'

No, but we shall never feel quite easy until

we know if Jem be right or not. Well, it is no
use talking about it any more. Time will show,
I suppose, whether Mr. Fleming is a desirable
acquaintance. Jem will never rest until he has
sifted matters  he will find out all about him,
and then write to us again  and I suppose we
must wait for that.'

And until then you will keep him at a
distance ?'

On the contrary, he keeps himself at a
distance, but I shall certainly do my best to
avoid him. I cannot help it, Olga,' as she
looked at me reproachfully ; for this was not
her idea of fairness. * Jem is right : we are two
unprotected females, and must take care of
ourselves ; and, after all, Mr. Fleming may bea
wolf in sheep's clothing.'

And then I carried away my letters, for what
was the use of prolonging the argument ? Olga
never could be induced to speak severely of
any sinner, however black he might be. To
her sweet nature it was a sort of necessity to
think the best of everyone. .She would even
have been sorry for the poor wolf : he must
have been so hungry before he had eaten the
sheep, as she would have said. Olga went alone
to the shore that morning, and after luncheon
we drove to St. Genette. Olga seemed a lite
tired on her return, and for a wonder betook

herself to a couch in the salon ; but I heard
her question Jeanne if Reggie had been to the
little gate as usual.

Jeanne had replied, to her surprise, in the
negative. Nothing had been seen of le petit.
That is strange,' had been Olga's response ;
Reggie has never failed me before ;' and then
she had taken up her book and said nothing
more.

As I was not tired, I went out into the garden
and strolled about a little. I could not help
feeling somewhat home-sick. I wished I were
in the old English garden with Jasper spreading
his tail on the mossy old sundial. The
peaches and nectarines must be ripening on the
sunny walls, and the flower-borders would bea
glowing mass of colours. I wondered if
Virginia were pacing the Lady's Walk as usual,
with her pale, sad face turned to the sunset.
I was so busy with these reflections that a
slight sound near me quite startled me. To
my surprise, and I may add annoyance, it was
Mr. Fleming unlatching the little gate. I could
scarcely believe my eyes when I saw him
deliberately unfasten it and come quickly
towards me.

I beg your pardon, Miss Seton, for this
intrusion,' he began hastily; * but I am in great
anxiety about Reggie : he looks very ill, and I

am going for the English doctor, if you will
kindly tell me where he lives ?'

Reggie ill ?' In a moment my brief annoyance
vanished.

Yes, and I do not know what is the matter
with him. He has been very sick, and seems
in a high fever. Will you tell me to whom I
had better go ? Inhere is no time to be lost, ashe
is all alone.' He looked at me wistfully and
hesitated. But there was no need for him to
say any more.

That child alone ! I will go to him at once ; of
course, I will stay with him while you are away.'

Oh, how good you are !' he said earnestly,
and I am sure there were tears in his eyes ;
he seemed terribly agitated. ' I wanted to ask
you, but I hardly dared to make such a request.
I have locked him in, because he seems wandering
a little ; but I could not bear leaving him
alone, poor little chap ! But if you will stop
with him '

He did not wait to finish his sentence, but
dashed up the steps and unlocked the door. I
could hear ReeSfie's voice talking rather excitedly
as I entered. But before looking at him,
I gave Mr. Fleming the necessary directions.
If Dr. Addison should be out, there is his
partner, Mr. Dodd, in the Rue d' Accord ; they
are both clever men,' I finished.

He nodded as though he understood me, and
ran down the steps  and I was left alone with
the boy. What a strange bare room ! just as
Olga described it ; even the gray kitten was
sitting on one of the steps leading to the loft.
The windows were all closed, probably for safety,
but I opened one of them ; the close stove was
alight, and a curiously shaped vessel like a big
coffee-pot with a black handle was on the top ;
I found it was full of hot water.

Reggie was tossing uncomfortably on his
pillows ; his dear little face was flushed, and his
lips hot and dry ; his beautiful eyes were wide
open, and had the lustrous look of fever. He
was chattering about ' a great big butterpie.'
Isn't it a funny butter pie ?' he asked when he
saw me.

1 knew very little about children's illnesses,
but I guessed it was a sudden feverish attack ;
perhaps he had been running about too much
in thes un, and had overheated himself, or he
had taken something to dlsaoree with him.
I knew Wilfred had these sort of attacks, and
often alarmed his parents ; some children were
always light-headed when they were unwell.
I would not let myself be frightened, though
he certainly looked very 111 ! The poor little
creature seemed wretchedly uncomfortable ; the
bedclothes were all in a heap. I was glad

now of the hot water ; I could sponge his face
and hands, and give him a little warm milk and
water to drink ; then I removed the pillow and
some of the outer coverings, and he seemed less
restless.

It would be some time before the doctor
could be here, and it was growing dusk. I had
some difficulty in lighting a small lamp that
stood on the writing-table ; it had not been
properly trimmed, and the flame was rather
smoky. I placed it as far as possible from the
bed, for it would never do to be left in darkness;
but the smell of the paraffin oil was sickening,
and the room looked bare and comfortless in
that murky light. What a place for a delicate
child ! the floor had evidently not been swept
for a week. I heard afterwards that Madame
Perrot neglected her lodgers ; and there were
marks of dust on everything.

Reggie seemed quieter now, and lay babbling
rather indistinctly of father and kitty. He
seemed to like me beside him ; once he thought
I was Olga. ' Tell me about the howl, my dear,'
he whispered with confidential huskiness  ' the
howl what lived in the ivy-bush.' That hour
seemed a very long one to me. Every now and
then I went to the door to listen. How dark and
quiet it looked outside  almost oppressively still!
Our little grove seemed to shut out the outer



world. Only once a sudden gleam shone through
the foliage ; it was a light from Olga's room 
she must be wondering at my long absence. The
next minute it disappeared and all was dark
again, and I went back to Reggie.

I was thankful when at last footsteps reached
my ears, and the door in the wall was unlocked.


It is Mr. Dodd. Dr. Addison is at St.
Genette. Have I been very long ?'

As Mr. Fleming put the question, he stooped
down and looked at his boy, and I shook hands
with the young doctor. I saw him cast a surprised
look round the room ; then his eyes
rested on Mr. Fleming a moment. He was
certainly a strange contrast to his surroundings ;
there was an indefinable air of refinement and
culture about him, that would have struck even
a stranger ; even the way he walked across the
room to fetch the smoky lamp was somehow
different to the way other men walked ; there
was a free grace in every movement, an ease of
bearing, a restrained strength, that was quite
unique.

He held the lamp quietly while Mr. Dodd
examined his little patient ; nor did he speak
except to answer his questions. I could not
help admiring his power of repressing himself


VOL. II. 2 2

'Well, what do you think of him ?' he asked,
when the doctor had finished.

I shall be able to tell you better to-morrow
was the evasive answer.

Is it anything infectious ?'

Oh no, not in the least. The child has been
running about too much in the sun ; he has
overheated or over-excited himself How long
has he been ailing ?'

He did not seem quite himself yesterday 
or was it the day before ?  he complained of
headache, and was rather drowsy. I kept him
quiet, and then he seemed better.'

He got a little wet in that shower yesterday,
did he not, Mr. Fleming ? I think Miss Leigh
told me so.'

Not very ; do you think that mattered ?'
looking at the doctor anxiously. I fancied Mr.
Dodd avoided his eye.

One cannot tell ; with these delicate children
it does not take much to make them ill.
I should say that he has been ailing for a day
or two. You must keep him very quiet, and
follow my directions. His hair is too long ; we
must alter that.'

Do you mean it must be cut off?' and the
poor young fellow turned exceedingly pale.

Oh, I dare say Miss Seton will see to that,'
in an off-hand way that deceived neither of us.



Now, are you going back with me in the carriage
? There will be medicine and ice required
; and you had better bring some Liebig's
essence back with you. Who is going to attend
to my orders ?'

You may give them to me, Mr. Dodd ;' and
I signed to him to follow me to the other side ot
the room. We spoke in the lowest possible
tones. I could see Mr. Fleming was strainer
his ears to catch what we said, but he could not
hear a word.

Is it only a simple feverish attack?'

I can hardly tell you to-night ; it Is more the
brain. I should say the child has the most
delicate organization ; he has evidently one
of those sensitive, highly-wrought natures that
are liable to this form of illness ; there is need
for great care. You will be with him tonight
?'

Yes, of course ; there is no one else to nurse
him. But, Mr. Dodd, do you think he could be
moved close by  to La Maisonnette ?'

To-night ?  no, certainly not ; you must
keep him where he is ; it is not very comfortable,
but it is cool and airy ;' and then he proceeded
to give me all directions, while Mr. Fleming
looked at us wistfully ; but he did not interfere,
only, as Mr. Dodd repeated once more, 'His hair
is too long and thick ; if you have some scissors

22 2

by you, I should advise you to cut it rather
closely,' I saw him fingering the rough locks, as
though he were loath to part with them ; and ashe
did so, his lips were pressed tightly together,
as though in intolerable pain.

As they went through the door in the wall, I
stood for an instant looking out into the dark
garden. As I did so, I caught a faint gleam of
whiteness in the distance. If it should be Olga
looking for me, for she was wearing a white
gown this evening ! With a sudden longing that
it should be so, I leaned over the parapet, and
called her name. To my relief, she instantly
responded, and I could hear her fumbling at the
gate.

Where are you, Aunt Catherine ?'

Here at the pavilion !'

Then I could hear her running down the
gravel-path, and in a minute she was beside
me.

Oh, Aunt Catherine, it is I who have been
frightened this evening ! We have been looking
for you everywhere, and then I thought I
heard your voice. But why are you here ?'

Hush, you must not speak so loud ; Reggie
is ill, and his father is just going back with the
doctor to fetch the medicine. I have promised
to stay with him to-night. But, Olga, I am so
thankful you have come ; there are so many

things I want that Jeanne must bring me. Mr.
Fleming will be away an hour, and I must put
things a little comfortable before his return. I
must have another lamp, not this smoky thing.'

I was holding the door as I spoke, but now
she put her hand over mine as though to
open it.

Tell me that presently. I must see Reggie
first,' and as I yielded to the strong girlish
pressure, she crossed the room and knelt down
by the bed. ' Oh, my darling, how ill he looks !'
and she lifted the little hands to her lips.

Reggie seemed to recognise her voice ; for
he smiled and muttered drowsily : ' She was so
pretty and fluffy, my dear, and had such nice
yellow eyes.'

Olga's eyes were full of tears as she listened
to him ; but there was no time to be lost on
mere sentiment. In a moment the dear girl was
as prompt and full of resources as ever. I saw
her looking round the room quickly, as though
to note its deficiencies.

I must have a lamp, Olga  that one with the
soft pretty shade ; and my work-basket, and
some of those fine towels, and a napkin or two,
and a duster, and '

Oh, there will be more than that required,'
she returned quietly ; ' I must bring Jeanne to
help me. You must have an easy-chair if you

are to sit up all night, and you have had no
supper, and Jeanne must make you some
coffee. Don't trouble yourself. Aunt Catherine ;
I will see to all that, and you must take care of
Reggie.'

And without trusting herself to look at him
again, she gave me a little reassuring nod and
went away, but I followed her to whisper
outside :

You will not let Jeanne make a noise.'

She shall not come farther than the steps.
I will bring everything myself. Oh, you may
trust me, dear !'

And she sent me back to my watch with the
comforting thought that I had a faithful helper
outside.

I am afraid to say how many journeys those
two women performed between La Maisonnette
and the pavilion during the next half-hour.
Every few minutes I heard faint sounds at the
bottom of the steps, and then Olga would enter,
noiselessly carrying in one thing after another
in her strong young arms, and quite regardless
of her own fatigue. I do not think I ever
admired her as I did that night. She was so
quiet, so helpful, so full of thought for me. The
easy-chair was placed by the bed, and a slip of
carpet and a footstool put near it. The smoky
lamp was carried away, and our pretty shaded

one placed in its stead. Then, to my surprise,
another easy-chair was put near the writing-table.
' It is for Mr. Fleming ; he will be so
tired,' she whispered.

Only once I saw her linger over her task ; it
was when she saw me beginning to cut off
Reggie's thick locks.

Oh, must you do that ?' she said with a little
sob, and the tears were running down her
cheeks as she went out. But it was not long
before she came back ; this time she carried a
tray covered with a napkin. ' It is your supper
and his she said softly. ' I am going to bring
you some coffee, and then there is nothing else
I can do. It is growing late, and Jeanne is
tired and wants to shut up.'

My dear, you have done such wonders,' and
I kissed her and wished her good-night.

She had only just gone when I heard the
latch of the door lifted, and Mr. Fleming entered.
I saw him give a dazed sort of look at
the room, as though he did not recognise it.
I dare say he wondered what magician's wand
had been at work during his absence. The
soft shaded light, the easy-chairs, the tempting
meal on the table, the steaming coffee-pot, must
each have been a mystery to him ; but tired
and jaded as he was, he was in no mood for
comfort. On the contrary, he helped me to

apply the ice to Reggie's head and give him
his medicine, waiting upon me in a way that
made me think again that he must have been
used to illness. The ingenious manner in which
he constructed a screen with a couple of chairs
and the quilt so as to shield Reggie from the
light proved him ready with resources. It was
not until there was nothing more to be done
that I saw him throw himself into a chair as
though he were exhausted ; and no wonder, for
he had tramped miles that day.

I poured him out some coffee, and putting
some sandwiches on a plate, placed the food at
his elbow ; but he was lying back in his chair
with closed eyes and took no notice. He
looked frightfully pale, and his hair was damp
and matted on his temples ; most likely he had
eaten nothing all day. I touched him gently to
rouse him. He opened his eyes ; their look of
misery was almost more than I could bear ; but
he only shook his head when I begged him to
eat.

I cannot  it is impossible !* was his answer ;
and then he closed his eyes again with a
groan.

He wanted me to go away and leave him,
but I dared not. Poor fellow !  he looked
little more than a boy in that light  he was
utterly spent with grief and inanition : the sight

of the little cropped head on the pillow had
turned him sick.

I must do him good in spite of himself.
Why need I mind him ? he was only Basil's ae,
and I was old enough to be his mother.

Mr. Fleming,' I said gently, ' you must
drink this coffee, and, pardon me, you must eat.
How are you to help me nurse Reggie if you
give way like this ?' and as he made no answer,
1 put my arm under his head, and held the cup
to his lips as though he were Reggie. ' Now
drink, please ;' and to my relief he obeyed me.

Most likely the first taste was like a cordial
to him, for he finished it almost at a draught ;
then I put a sandwich in his hand : ' Now eat
that, and I will bring you some more coffee.
Tell me truly  you have eaten nothing today
?'

Yes ; I had some bread : that was all there
was in the house. I could not leave Reggie to
get anything else. May I have some more
coffee ? it is delicious.'

Yes ; but you must finish all those sandwiches.'
But I had no need to urge him : the
craving for food had returned, and he ate what
I had placed before him as though he were
famished ; but when he had finished he pushed
away the plate with a gesture of disgust.

Isn't it horrid to think I can eat, with him

lying there ! Miss Seton, you are an angel of
goodness to me to-night ! Tell me, do you
think my boy is in danger ?'

He took my hand as he spoke ; his were hot
and trembling.

o

How can I tell ?' I faltered. ' He is very
ill ; and, indeed, I must go back to him. There
is great need for care  Mr. Dodd said so ; but
he is no worse  I think he is even quieter.'

He drew a long breath, and then looked at
me rather strangely.

If he should get worse would you promise
to tell me ?'

Yes ; I will ask Mr. Dodd to do so.'

You must keep your promise, for a good
deal depends on it. He will not get worse,
dear little chap, will he ? Only  only, you
know, in that case I must tell his mother.'

His mother ! Was he wandering ? had
anxiety about Reggie been too much for him ?

'Yes, I must tell Aline  I mean, I must tell
my wife. She is in England ;' and when he
had said this he raised himself with difficulty,
and went to look at Reggie.

CHAPTER III

HE IS Everything TO ME.'

With patience to endure our griefs we learn not soon,
But how much later still to take them as a boon ?

Archbishop Trench.
Thou who art
So happy in Thy heaven alway,
Take not mine only bliss away I'

Mrs. Browning.

I \\EXT back to my little patient. Reggie was
moaning, and seemed restless and ill at ease ; but
after a time he quieted down again into the same
drowsy state. I sat beside him silently, holding
the hot tiny hand in mine ; there was so little
one could do. Now and then a shiver passed
over me as I thought of Air. Fleming's words.

Jem was right, after all ; there was need indeed
to be careful. What would Olga say ? How
would she be able to defend Mr. Fleming now ?
She had pitied him, in her simplicity, thinking
him a heart-broken widower ; how would she

receive the astounding intelligence that his
wife was really alive and in England  that
Reggie had a mother ? Would she not be
shocked by his reticence, his seeming indifference
? Would she not ask, as I was questioning
myself now, what it could all mean ?

And yet there might be some explanation
possible, some satisfactory solution of the
mystery. He might have come over to St.
Croix on Reggie's account. Perhaps he was
too poor to bring his wife too ; she might be
delicate an invalid. Only the strongest necessity
would induce him to alarm her by the
account of Reggie's illness ; it was his care,
his thoughtfulness for this wife of his  this
Aline  not his indifference, that had prompted
his silence.

All these suggestions were plausible enough,
then why did I not believe them ? Why did
I instinctively refuse to acknowledge them,
while a growing distrust and uneasiness seized
me ?

Mr. Fleming is a perfect stranger to us,' so
the inward argument went on ; ' he is a proud,
reserved man. Is such an one likely to speak
of his family affairs ? How was he to read our
thoughts, or to know that we had imagined him
a widower ? Such an idea may have never
entered his head. This is not the reason why

he has kept himself so aloof, and made no
response to our friendly overtures ;' and so on.

I could not refute these arguments ; but a
woman judges by instinct, and in my inmost
heart I felt that Jem's story was true. Mr.
Fleming was evidently a dissatisfied, unhappy
man. That this unhappiness was connected in
some way with his married life I was now as
convinced as though the evidence were before
my eyes. He had married beneath him, and
he was now ashamed of the woman he had
made his wife. Perhaps they were separated !
And Olga had been thrown into the company
of this man ! No wonder her young guardian,
Jem, was up in arms. What would Mr. Leigh
say ? My responsibility weighed heavy on me
that night. How was I to behave in future to
this poor wolf in sheep's clothing ? How was
1 to keep him and Olga apart, and yet do my
duty to this worse than motherless child  this
little innocent being who was perhaps made the
scapegoat of his parents' transgressions ? And
as I asked myself these perplexing questions I
involuntarily raised my eyes. Mr. Fleming
was watching me, as though he read my
thoughts ; his face had grown paler and more
haggard. His fixed, miserable glance gave mea
shock.

Do not be hard upon me ; you do not know

it all.' That was what his eyes seemed to santo
me. Poor boy ! he was so young  only
Basil's age, if Basil was living. How was one
to judge him severely ? That tired, sad young
face seemed to appeal strangely to me.

The next minute I rose softly, and taking up
the strip of soft carpet Olga had put for my use,
I spread it beside him with a hassock and
Reggie's rejected pillow. He looked at me
with a bewildered air, as though he did not
understand what I was doing. I put my hand
on his shoulder :

'You are worn out,' I said gently; 'this is
the only couch I can contrive for you. You
must lie down and try to sleep. I will promise
to wake you if there be anything for you to do ;
and '  as he hesitated  ' you will be able to
help me more tomorrow if you sleep now.'

Do you really mean it ?' he asked under his
breath.

Yes ; please do not keep me waiting. I
want to cover you with this '  pointing to a
wrap in my hand. ' This place is very draughty.'

And then his weariness was so great he resisted
no longer. As I stooped to adjust the
covering he arrested my hand and carried it to
his lips.

Oh, how good you are ! I never knew anyone
so brood ! I do not deserve it.'

But almost before I left him his eyes closed
and he was asleep. Once or twice during the
night I looked at him as I passed to and fro
on some errand ; he was sleeping soundly, his
head pillowed on one arm, the other stretched
on the rug that covered him. There was something
boyish in his attitude ; his face looked
calm and happy, as though some peaceful dream
had beguiled him. There were no lines now
in the broad, open forehead ; the smooth, dark
face was at rest. The firm lips had relaxed
into a half-smile. Only once, when the dawn
felt chilly and I put a shawl over him, he stirred
and frowned.

Don't, Aline ; it hurts  it hurts dreadfully !'
I heard him mutter, as he flung away from
me.

During the hours that followed I had plenty
of time for reflection. I could make my plans
for the morrow undisturbed. After all, there
was a way out of my perplexity. Olga must
be made to understand that any intercourse
with Mr. Fleming must be forbidden for the
future. Only on this understanding could I
retain my present post. She was so unselfish
she would not refuse, for Reggie's sake. If
Olga were only off my mind, I felt I could
devote myself gladly to the service of these
two helpless beings  for a man is generally

helpless in some degree In a sick-room, unless
he is especially fitted by nature for a nurse.

Mr. Fleming was not without resources. He
was helpful and self-reliant, but his anxiety for
his child unmanned him. I knew that for his
boy's good he would allow himself to be guided
and advised ; his very gratitude would make
him pliable in my hands. No, I must not disquiet
myself any more ; with a little tact and
discrimination I should be able to steer through
my difficulties.

I was so sure, too, that Olga's good sense
v;ould aid me  the dear child had never yet
disappointed me.

The longest night must have an end, and
by-and-by I saw the gray dawn creeping
through the uncurtained window ; there were
faint streaks of light across the sky ; the birds
began to twitter. The coming day was
heralded by numerous voices  by the crowing
of cocks from the poultry-yards ; by the faint
bleating of sheep. The sun was rising, and
soon the happy, waking earth would be bathed
in his golden radiance. It was still so early,
that I was surprised to hear footsteps approaching.
They were not Jeanne's sabots
clattering up the steps ; that light tread could
only belong to Olga.

The next instant there was a gentle knock,



the door was softly opened, and my dear girl
entered, looking a little pale and anxious, as
though she had not rested as well as usual, and
laden with a heavy tray that she had carried all
the way from La Maisonnette.

I thought you would like your breakfast
early,' she whispered in my ear ; ' so, as I was
awake, I would not trouble Jeanne. How is he,
Aunt Catherine ?'

I do not quite know, my dear. He does
not seem worse ; but it is for the doctor to
tell us.'

Oh, he is not worse, I can see it ; I am sure
of it,' she returned, kneeling down by the bed
and kissing him softly. ' Oh, my darling ! how
sweet he looks ! but I am so sorry his pretty
hair has been touched.'

Hush, Olga !' for she had not perceived Mr.
Fleming, and he was now awake and watching
us. ' My dear, will you go away now and come
to me presently ?' and she understood me in a
moment and rose at once  a hint was always
enough for Olga. She did not look beyond the
bed, but only said quietly :

Yes, I will see you by-and-by. Please take
your breakfast, Aunt Catherine ;' and then she
went away softly.

1 looked at the meal her loving hands had
prepared. There was a little brown teapot for

VOL. II. 23

me; a tiny coffee-pot, that was evidently intended
for Mr. Fleming ; a pile of crisp, delicious-looking
toast ; some new-laid eggs ; a pat of
fresh, golden butter. All served so daintily ! I
could see Mr. Fleming was looking at it too.'

This is your breakfast as well as mine,' I
said with a smile.

May I have it presently ?' he returned quite
humbly, as though he were asking a favour. ' I
must go down to the bay and have a dip first.
I could not sit down like this,' with a shrug, as
though he were conscious of his jaded appearance.


The stove is still warm ; it will heat your
coffee. Yes, go ; it will do you good ;' but he
lingered to look at Reggie and question me.

She did not think that he looked any worse.'

'Who? oh, you mean Miss Leigh. No, I do
not think he is worse this morning. Indeed, he
seems rather easier.'

If he should get well, it will be you who will
have saved him,' he replied in a voice of intense

emotion ; ' what shall I not owe you  if  if '

he stopped as though unable to say another
word.

Please do not say any more ; we cannot tell.
It is in God's hands, not mine. Look what a
lovely morning it is !'

I am keeping you from your breakfast, and

you look SO tired,' he returned remorsefully ;
I will go,' and he hurried away.

Five minutes later Olga's soft footsteps
returned again.

He has gone to bathe,' she said eagerly ; ' I
saw him pass with his towels. So we are safe
for some time. Let me pour out your tea,
Aunt Catherine, and then I must put things a
little comfortable for you both.'

She was running away, but I held her fast.

Olga, my dear, I want to speak' to you. I
had rather a shock last night. Mr. Fleming 
oh, I don't want to speak against him, poor
fellow ! but he is not what we thought him 
not a widower. His wife is living; she is in
England.'

I fancied she turned a shade paler in her
surprise ; but she answered me very quietly :

I am glad that he told you. It is better to
know the truth about people i'

Yes, and Jem must have been right in what
he wrote.'

Very probably,' but there was no indignation
in her clear tones ; * it was stupid of me to
get that idea into my head ; but I certainly
thought his wife was dead. Did he say anything
about her. Aunt Catherine ?'

Not a word  only that he must tell her if
Reggie got worse. Olga, I fear there must be

 ILUNUlS

something very wrong. It makes me uneasy
that you should be with him.'

It is not our affair,' she returned quickly ;
his wife has nothings to do with us. It is only
Reggie who concerns us. You will not forsake
him, surely ?'

Not if  if  you will promise '

There is nothing for me to promise,' she
replied with a touch of impatience in her voice ;
it is not I who am nursing Reggie ; it is only
you, Aunt Catherine.'

Yes ; but, my dear, do you not see my
difficulty ? Last night Mr. Fleming slept upon
the floor, and when to-night comes, what am I
do with him ? and there is no other room than
this, and you and Jeanne are alone at La
Maisonnette !'

But I shall not be there to-night,' she
returned, as though a bright idea struck her.
Listen to me, dear  to-night you shall lie
down, and I will watch Reggie. There is the
big couch in the drawing-room that can be
brought over to the pavilion, and you shall rest,
and I will call you from time to time.'

And Mr. Fleming ?'

Oh, there is the room at the end of the
passage,' she answered in an off-hand manner.
Jeanne shall get it ready for him, and he shall
have his supper and breakfast in the salle-manger

; and Jeanne will wait on him : is it not an
excellent idea ? but we must not talk any more 
your tea is getting cold, and I want to do a lite
dusting before he returns. Do you see this red
sash, Aunt Catherine ? when he goes out and
you want me, you must fasten this to the railing
at the top of the steps, and when I come to the
little gate I shall see it ; it is to be our signal to
each other. There, I have arranged it all, and
there is nothing to say more !' and she moved
away quietly and began to put things in order,
arranging the books in neat piles, and removing
the lamp ; but she had not been long at work
before the door in the wall was unlatched, and
Mr. Flemings re-entered, looking all the fresher
for his bath. Olga left off at once and shook
hands with him. ' I am sure Reggie looks a
little better,' she said in a low voice. ' Aunt
Catherine has finished her breakfast ; you must
have yours now;' and she went out, carrying the
lamp with her. I saw a strange, undefinable
expression flit across Mr. Fleming's face as he
closed the door after her ; perhaps those few
words cheered him, for he seemed to enjoy his
breakfast, although directly he had finished he
seemed so restless that I recommended him to
stroll up and down the garden until Mr. Dodcl
arrived.

Do I fidget you ?' he asked penitently. ' I

am afraid you want to get rid of me. If I could
only control this restlessness !'

You will walk It off,' was my reply ; and to
my relief he took my advice. I suppose Olga
saw him marching up and down the little path,
for she never came near us.

Mr. Dodd's report was hardly as satisfactory
as I had expected ; his manner was guarded and
he spoke vaguely.

Oh no, our little patient is no worse,' he
said in answer to the father's anxious questioning
; ' Indeed, I trust he is going on fairly well ;
but there is little change, and we cannot be too
careful. A great deal depends on the nursing ;'
and here he looked at me.

I saw at once that he would not speak out
plainly before Mr. Fleming ; so I begged the
latter to leave us for a few minutes, and he
obeyed me rather reluctantly.

Now, Mr. Dodd,' I began as he closed the
door, ' you may speak to me as openly as you
wish.'

I do not want to alarm you,' he replied
cautiously ; ' but the child is very 111, and one
can never tell in these cases.'

You do not find any Improvement, then ?'

No material improvement  certainly not.'
And we must not move him ?'

On no account ; he will do very well where

he is  this room is cool and airy ; and as far as
quietness goes it might be a hermitage ; but I
suppose,' looking at me inquiringly, ' there is
very little accommodation ? still, La Maisonnette
is so close.'

Oh, we can manage !' for it was no use
taking a stranger into confidence. And, after
all, Olga's plan could be tried ; so, after giving
me a few more directions and promising to call
in the evening, Mr. Dodd took his leave. He
was young ; but his manner gave me confidence,
and I had heard from the Milners that he was
considered extremely clever.

After our early luncheon was over, I wrote
out rather a long list of things that I required
from the town. . There was money to be
changed at the bank, and various commissions
to be executed, Mr. Fleming undertook them
cheerfully. I could see that he was sanguine
about Reggie ; he thought Mr. Dodd had not
spoken quite so gravely, and, of course, I did not
undeceive him. The long walk would be good
for him, and he would have the pleasure of
feeling himself of use, besides which, his absence
for an hour or two would enable us to make
arrangements for the night. There was much
to be done ; the pavilion was pleasant enough
by day, but it was decidedly cold and cheerless
by night. Directly Mr. Fleming had started

for St. Croix, I hung out the red signal, and
after a little delay Olga come. I set her and
Jeanne to work, and in about an hour we had
made things more comfortable. The big couch
with pillows and quilt was placed ready for the
night, and a Japanese screen round it. Some
more strips of carpet were laid over the boards,
the newly-trimmed lamp brought back, and
Olga had actually washed the floor over, and
had placed a great bowl of roses on the writing-table
before Mr. Fleming returned.

He came in hot and dusty, and paused a
moment on the threshold. Olga had her back
turned to the door, and did not see him ; she
was arranging the lite tea-table. She wore a
coarse bib-apron over her pretty summer gown,
and had pinned a handkerchief over her brown
hair to protect her from the dust. Mr. Fleming
did not seem to recognise her. I saw him put
up his arm to shield his eyes, as though the
sunshine dazzled him. She started and coloured
a little when she turned round and saw him,
but did not speak. When she had left the
room, Mr. Fleming came close to me.

Miss Seton,' he said hurriedly, as though
he were agitated, 'please do not let Miss Leigh
work in the way she is doing ; it pains me excessively
to see it ; it is not right. I have strong
arms. I am not useless. There is nothing I

will not do if you will only tell me how I maybe
of service. It is not for Miss Leigh, it is
for me, to work.'

I looked up into the young determined face.
In my heart I admired the proud independence
that refused a girl's services. Unwittingly he
had placed into my hands.

Will you really promise to do as I wish ?'

Try me !' was the eager answer ; and a
wonderful softness came into his gray eyes.

Oh, if he had only been Basil, I felt then
that I could have loved him !

You are very good,' I returned quietly ; and
then I explained to him the arrangements we
had made for the night.

To my dismay, he turned very pale, and
looked exceedingly unhappy.

Oh, you will not do that ?' he said piteously ;
you will never ask me to leave him ? I would
do anything else. I will sit up all night, or
there is the loft. I would lie down on a heap of
shavings  anything  anything  so that I maybe
near him !'

But, Mr. Fleming '

Oh, you don't know what he is to me !' he
interrupted. ' If he should die, I should just
go and hang or drown myself. 1 could not
live without my boy , baby as he is, he is everything
to me.'

The tears came into my eyes to hear him
talk Hke that, poor fellow ! and for his own sake
I must be firm. I took his hand  it was
clenched, and felt like iron  and I spoke to him
as though I were his mother.

My dear,' I said, ' you must not talk so ;
you have been very good and patient. No
one could have behaved better ; but you must
trust me  a little. 1 am very tired, for I did
not close my eyes last night, and if Olga will
sit beside Reggie I shall be able to sleep.'

It will be all the same,' he urged eagerly ;
you can rest there behind that screen, and I
will promise not to take my eyes off him. Do
you think I cannot keep awake as well as Miss
Leigh ? And it is my own boy who is lying
there !'

I shook my head. He was making it very
difficult for me, and yet I would not give it up.
I knew that there would be no rest for me
under such circumstances. He would not know
how to manage Reggie, and I should spend the
night in watching them both.

He looked at me in his keen way.

This does not please you ; you want me to

g

away

Yes, for this one night. It will be better.
I would not propose it if I did not know it
would be for the best. Mr. Fleming, you must

not think me cruel. If Reggie be worse  if there
be any change, I mean  I will promise that
you shall be called at once. If you leave your
window open, there will be no difficulty. Either
Olga or I will come. Can you not trust me
this once ?'

He did not answer for a moment, and then he
said in a hasty tone :

Yes, I can trust you ; but it is long since I
have said that to any woman ; but, remember, it
will be with my all. Very well, I will go ; send
me away when you wish ;' and then he went
back to Reggie ; but it wrung my heart to see
him sitting there with his head buried in his
hands. Ah me, that the love for a little child
should be so great, and yet there are many of
us who doubt the Fatherhood of God !

It was late, nearly ten o'clock, before I asked
him to withdraw. He had not once moved or
spoken ; but at my first whisper he rose at
once, and, with one long look at his boy, went
out on the steps, where Jeanne and her lantern
were waiting for him. I could not let him go
like that, and followed him out.

Mr. Fleming, you will try to sleep ? I may
need you tomorrow.'

Oh yes, I shall try,' he replied in a weary tone.

You do not know how grateful I am to you
for this compliance with my wishes.'

I would rather you had told me to lie down
on these stones ; may I  ' with a sudden change
of tone  ' may I stop outside here ?'

And lay up rheumatism for life ! No, certainly
not, and there Is a comfortable bed ready
tor you. Come, Jeanne, I entrust monsieur to
your care ; make him comfortable. Good-night,
Mr. Fleming; God will watch over Reggie as
well as though you were beside him. You must
trust your boy to Him ;' but I must confess that
I felt a sad choking sensation In my throat as I
watched him walking with bent head, as though
he hardly knew where he was going. Once I
saw Jeanne catch hold of his arm as though he
were stumbling.

Olga was sitting beside Reggie, and looked
wakeful and vigilant. There was no need for
any words between us, and I threw myself
heavily on the couch, and was soon asleep.
Two or three times that night Olga roused me,
but I always resumed my interrupted nap.

I woke at last of my own accord, and peeped
round the screen. The gray dawn was just
breaking, but the lamp was still alight. To my
surprise, Olga had quitted her post. I thought
I heard her voice speaking to someone outside ;
the next minute she re-entered.

Were you speaking to Mr. Fleming, Olga ?'

Yes ; this Is the second time he has come.'

He has not slept, then ?'

Yes, during the earlier part of the night ; but
towards morning he got restless. I have sent
him away happier this time, Aunt Catherine. I
do believe Reggie is a little better -that Mr.
Dodd will say so.'

I thought so, too, as I looked at him, and in
our joy and relief we kissed each other, and
Olga cried a little.

Oh, he is such a darling !' she said ; * I think
it would break my heart if we were to lose him.
I do not believe I have ever liked any other
child in quite the same way ;' and I understood
her. The little creature had certainly found
his way to our hearts in the most singular
manner.

And now, Aunt Catherine,' she continued ina
different voice, ' what are we to do about
breakfast ?'

Are you very tired, Olga ?'

Not so very tired,' was the brisk reply ; * but
I shall have a nap presently.'

Then in that case I will leave you in charge
for an hour, while I change my things and refresh
myself. Shall you be afraid to be left,

Olga r

Not a bit ! you must stay and have breakfast
with Mr. Fleming. Yes, that will be best,
Aunt Catherine.'

I knew 1 could trust her, and there was
nothing to be done for Reggie ; so I went back
to La Maisonnette. Jeanne was in the salle-manger,
and I begged her to prepare an
early breakfast. Just as I was sitting down to
the table, Mr. Fleming came in, evidently from
another dip in the bay, for he had his towels
over his arm ; he looked very pleased to
see me.

'Reggie is better!' he said eagerly. 'Miss
Leigh is sure of it.'

Yes, I think so, I hope so ! We shall see
what Mr. Dodd says ;' and then I added reproachfully:
'After all, you have not slept.'

Oh yes, I have !' he returned in a boyish
sort of way ; ' and the bed was so comfortable !
I slept quite two hours, and then I got up and
dressed, and went over to the pavilion ; Miss
Leigh heard me, and came out.'

Yes, I know.'

I went back again and had another nap ;
but somehow I could not get the dear little
chap out of my thoughts, and I was obliged to
run across again. I am afraid Miss Leigh
must have thought me a bore.'

I am afraid so too.'

He gave an odd little laugh at that, and then
said rather unsteadily.

Don't chaff me, please ; of course I behaved

like an ass last night; but if you knew what it
cost me to obey you !'

I do know.'

And yet you asked me to go ! Never mind,
I am too happy to reproach you. Well, it was
the hardest bit of work I ever did in my life ;
but all the same, I did it.' And then a curious
change came over his face, and he walked away
to the window. ' If Reggie be really better,' he
said as he stood there, ' there will be no need
to tell Aline ; we shall not be here much longer.'

Do you not think that in any case his
mother ought to know ?' I asked cautiously.

No, I think not,' was the hesitating answer ;
there are mothers and mothers. Aline is not
one of the anxious sort And with this vague
response he whistled to Rollo, and went out into
the garden until I had finished my breakfast.

LOOKING AT THE SUNSET.

Oh, the moorland by the sea I The red sun in gallant
splendour
Drops his morning kiss upon it, ere he goeth on his way,
Or athwart its gold and purple steals a benediction tender,
Ere night's starry curtains shroud him at the dewy close of
day.'

Helen Marion Burnside.

I WAS much comforted to find that Mr. Dodd
endorsed our favourable opinion of Reggie.
The child was going on well, he said  much
better than he had ventured to hope ; there had
been a change for the better in the night, and
though there was still the same care required,
he trusted there would be no relapse. I told
him how we had managed for the night, and
the hard work I had had with Mr. Fleming.
I thought he seemed much interested.

You were perfectly right,' he said ; ' you
have saved yourself wisely for to-night ; you

could not possibly have done otherwise. Mr.
Fleming will be reasonable enough to own
this.'

He could not have kept awake,' I replied ;
he was so worn-out with anxiety, and I should
have been watching them both all night.'

Yes, 1 understand ; get him over to La
Maisonnette again to-night, if you like. I cannot
dispense with my head-nurse yet.' Mr.
Dodd and I understood each other perfectly.
I overheard him afterwards talking to Mr.
Fleming on the steps.

Leave it all to the ladies,' he was saying.
'Miss Seton is an excellent nurse; you are
perfectly safe in her hands. The boy is doing
very well ; and with such scanty accommodation
'

Oh, I do not mind about to-night !' replied
Mr. Fleming in his eager way, without letting
the doctor finish. ' They may send me where
they like, but last night it was different. Doctor,'
dropping his voice, ' I give you my word I would
rather have cut my throat than have had to go
off and leave that little chap ; and yet, when
she told me to go, I was obliged to obey her.
She is a woman one must obey somehow ; 1
never knew anyone like her.'

Oh yes, I know what you mean ; and she is
a capital nurse, too. Very well, I shall look in

VOL. II. 24

again this evening. Can I take you down to
the town, Mr. Fleming ? It will be a little
distraction, and you will be out of the lady's
way. '

I think this latter argument prevailed ; for
Mr. Fleming let himself be carried off as
quietly as a lamb. Olga went back to La
Maisonnette for a couple of hours, and I was
left alone with my little charge.

Oh. the stillness of that noontide watch ! I
had to shake off drowsiness once or twice by
walking to the open window. Outside the sunshine
was blazing : white butterflies. Reggie's
favourite playfellows, were fluttering hither and
thither ; the low apple-trees were bending under
their load ; some bees were returning laden with
honey from the fields of clover ; an old man ina
blue blouse was working among the cabbage ;
our little grove looked cool and shady. How
long had I been at the pavilion ? Only two
days  the time seemed endless ! Two days
ago Mr. Fleming had been a stranger, and now
I did not try to disguise from myself the strong
interest I felt in him. He had come into my
life with this strange suddenness, and I felt that
I could never banish him again.

Olga will not always be with me,' I thought,
as I looked out dreamily at the gray head
bobbing among the cabbages. * It is only for

her sake that I am careful. Why should I not
continue his friend, even if we find Basil ? there
will be room for him. I must find out why he
is so lonely and unhappy, and then, surely, there
will be some way of helping him. Even Virginia
will be interested ; she is so sorry for
people who are unhappy ; and we are rich ;'
and a sort of gladness came over me as I
remembered our beautiful home  a sudden
sense of power and well-being  almost for the
first time. And he had the same name ; and it
was the sort of work Robert would have loved.
to make this poor young man believe in human
nature ao-ain.

Mr. Fleming returned just as Jeanne came
over from La Maisonnette with our luncheon.
She told me Olga was still asleep, so I charged
her on no account to disturb her. The rest
of the day passed very quietly. ]mr. Fleming
spent the afternoon watching his boy ; but he
was careful not to disturb me. If I wanted
him, he was always at my side in a moment ;
and he seemed very grateful if I let him do
anything for Reggie.

I am not in the way, am I ?' he asked once.
I wish there where something I could do for you,
but I am such a clumsy fellow. Still, if you
will only let me stop, I do so love to watch him.
Look here, Miss Seton, I think he wants to

24  2

keep me :' and he showed me how Reggie's
feeble fingers were clinging round his hand.

Of course you may stay 1 returned, smiling
at them both : it was such a pretty picture, only,
somehow, I could only see it dimly through
a mist. ' Do you think that I can have the
heart to send you away again so soon ?'

He looked a little grave at the remembrance
of the previous night, but he only said :

I am afraid I was ver' selfish. You were
quite right  Mr. Dodd said so ; and if I had
fallen asleep I should never have forgiven
myself.'

Well, I am going to reward your obedience,'
1 returned lightly ; and, as he laid the little hand
down and followed me to the window, I continued
: * You may stay here to-night if you like.
At least, I can promise you a better couch than
the floor.'

His face lighted up in a moment; a quick
flush of pleasure crossed it.

Do you really mean it ? Will you indeed
permit me to stay ? Shall I not be a hindrance
to you ?'

No ; I have been thinking it over. I have
promised Mr. Dodd that I will take the
nursing myself to-night, and as, thanks to you,
I had some hours' sleep, I shall be able to
manage it.'

And, of course, Miss Leigh is tired ."'

She would not own it ; but her watch was a
long one, and she is not used to nursing. Soif
you do not mind '

I  mind !'  and a flash of the gray eyes
answered me. ' I, who owe evening to
your goodness, your generosity  my bDy s life
my '

Hush, please !'  laying my hand on his arm.
1 almost forgot he was not belonging to me ;
we so soon grow to love those who are dependent
on us for kindness, and he was only a
boy to me  a boy Hke Basil. 'Well, that is
arranged, and '

Wait one moment, please. There is Miss
Leigh ; we must not forget her. She would
like to say good-night to Reggie  she is so
fond of him, and he of her. Do you think I
do not see all that ?'

Well ?'

May I look if she be still in the garden ?
she was there just now  and then I will
bring her across.'

There was a repressed eagerness in his
manner ; but I hardly knew how to refuse. It
was such a little thing to ask, and it would
please Olga. So. after a moment's hesitation
which I hoped he did not notice  I let him
go. Five minutes after I saw them walking

down the path, and went out on the steps to
meet them.

Aunt Catherine,' Olga said brightly, and I
could see she was quite pleased and excited,
Mr. Fleming says there is such a beautiful
sunset, and you must go with him and see it
while I sit by Reggie. It will not take you
long, and the air will do you good, and you
have a long night before you.'

So this was what they had plotted  for I could
see how busily they were talking  as they came
up the garden ; after all, it was only about me.

We have settled all that. Miss Seton,' observed
Mr. Fleming, with his old coolness ; ' if
you will just fling that lace thing over your
head, we will go at once.'

And I will stop with Reggie. Do please
go, Aunt Catherine ;' and Olga put her arms
round me and gave me a gentle little push
towards the steps, and Mr. Fleming held out
his hand. ' It will only take you a few minutes,
and the boy is so much better.'

Yes, I think he is, Olga. Mr. Dodd seemed
quite surprised at the progress he has made
since the morning.' And then I let myself be
persuaded ; my head felt heavy and tired, and
the evening air was so delicious.

I was surprised to see Mr. Fleming unlock
the door in the wall.

We shall see it much better from the
common, and the air is fresher there,' he explained
; ' and it is just as quiet as the garden.'
And then, as we walked down the field, he
said hurriedly : ' I think Miss Leigh will like
to be alone with Reggie. She has taken such
a wonderful fancy to him, has she not ?'

Yes ; but, then, Olga is so fond of children
-  most young girls are.' And, just to tease
him, I continued, half laughing : ' Yesterday
you seemed reluctant to accept her services.
I recollect quite a little tirade on the
subject.'

Oh, that is quite another matter,' he returned,
in an embarrassed tone. ' I hope you
did not think me ungracious ; but if you knew
how I felt when I came in and saw everything
so fresh and beautiful, and Miss Leigh standing
there in that apron '

Well, of course it was not very becoming ;
not that Olga would think of that.'

That is not what I mean at all,' he returned
impatiently ; ' but I see you are only joking. It
is not for me to notice what is becoming to a

young lady, though ' he paused, and then

hurried on. ' No, it was of something quite
different that I was thinking. I had been
bothering myself all the way home, thinking
what a muddle I had made of my life, and how

everything brings its own punishment. I had
just made up my mind I was not fit to be in the
room with two such good women, and then I
opened the door and saw Miss Leigh. I felt as
though some princess had deigned to visit a
beggar, and to put his hut in order. Somehow
I felt quite crushed by it all, and that made me
speak out as I did.'

Yes, I see. But, Mr. Fleming, you do not
understand Olga ; she is one who loves to do a
kindness for anyone ;' for I did not want him to
think that she would not have done the same for
the oldest and plainest man in her Majesty's
dominions.

Do you think I do not know that ?' and
there was a touch of haughtiness in his manner;
he did not like to be misunderstood. ' I have
never met with anyone like Miss Leigh before;
but I am glad to know that there are such
people in the world. I am afraid I have not
been a devout believer in human goodness,
especially female human nature. It does me
good to see such a noble exception.'

Perhaps your wife  at least ' I

stopped in some confusion. What was I going
to say ?

He turned round with rather a bewildered
air.

We were not speaking of my wife, but of

Miss Leigh. Do not let us talk of Aline
just now. Look at that sunset ! is not that
glorious  unutterably glorious ? One cannot
be quite hopeless when one looks at
that !'

We had both stopped simultaneously. Seton
Point was just below us, and all around us the
flashing waters of the bay. The western
heavens were blazing with marvellous light, one
colour merging into another: now crimson, now
rose edged with pearl, now a sheet of vivid gold,
with a molten, glittering sea under it. It
seemed to me as I stood there as though a door
were opened in heaven  as though that flood of
glory must herald the white-robed messengers
of mercy, the guardian angels of the night, if
only our eyes were not too gross to see them.
How dim this world must look to them as they
glide through those mysterious portals  this
little world, where man plays his sorry part !

I looked at Mr. Fleming as these thoughts
passed through my mind. He was standing
with folded arms, intently watching the spectacle.


How beautiful, how unearthly it all looks!' he
murmured. ' I have never seen anything quite
so fine before. Miss Seton, in the face of all
that,' pointing to the sea and sky, * I could not
talk of my wife. Some day, when Reggie is

better  quite well, I mean  I will tell you my
miserable story, and you will say to me, *' Goodbye,
Mr. Fleming ; for I do not wish for your
acquaintance any more." '

I am sure I shall say no such thing.'

Will you not ? but you have not heard my
story yet. Oh, I grant you there are extenuating
circumstances !  young hot blood, the wilfulness
of boyhood ; but there are some things
that harden a man, that drag him down ; and,
after all, I have been much to blame.'

Perhaps so.'

He turned round and looked at me with a
smile.

Do you think that forgiveness is possible ?
but you do not know  ingratitude is not a light
sin.'

No sin is light. Air. Fleming ; but I am one
who believes in repentance. A man may go
wrong ; but it is never too late to retrace his
steps. While there is life there is hope ; we
may say that of every human creature.'

Hove curious !' he observed, in a musing
tone ; ' but you remind me so much of a friend
of mine. Sometimes when you are speaking, I
seem to hear his voice ; he thought, like you,
that there are infinite possibilities in every
human being; he was always talking about such
things ;' he stopped, and, by his frown, I could

see he was trying to throw off some painful
recollection.

Mr. Fleming, I am afraid we must go
back.'

Oh, I had forgotten Reggie for the moment
! Fancy my forgetting that boy even for
an instant ! Do you know, I could not sleep
without him last night  not properly, I mean 
I have got so used to feeling him near me ; I
like to know I have oot him all safe. Isn't it
strange to care for a child like that ? I could
not have believed it once.'

I suppose he is your only child, Mr.
Fleming ?'

I thought he seemed a little surprised at the
question.

Yes, there was a girl ; but she only lived
three months ; she died in convulsions.' He
turned his face away. ' I was sorry at the time ;
but I think I am glad now, and I only want
Reggie.'

We had reached the pavilion by this time,
and found Olga sitting beside the boy. She
rose directly she saw us, and wished us both
good-night.

It was growing dusk, and after a short interval
Mr. Fleming lighted the lamp and sat
down to read ; but his attention often strayed
from his book. Reggie was a little restless at

first, but after an hour or two he seemed more
comfortable, and then Mr. Fleming said he
would have a nap, and I saw nothing more of
him until morning. He was young enough to
sleep soundly, and there was no reason to
disturb him. He told me afterwards that he
had never rested more comfortably. ' I felt
even in my dreams that I was near him, and
I knew you would wake me if he got restless
again. Now you must let me take your place,
for you look downright ill this morning I
told him that I would o across to La Maison-mette
presently, when Mr. Dodd had paid his
early visit, and I kept my word. Olga was
evidently expecting me.

Oh, you poor thing, how tired you look !'
was her first orreetinof.

Never mind that, Olga dear. Mr. Dodd
says that Reggie is quite out of danger now,
so I am oroinof to leave him to his father this

o o

morning, and have a nice rest. Tell Jeanne
to attend to Mr. Fleming's luncheon. He is to
put up the red signal if I am wanted. They
will do very well for a few hours : Mr. Dodd
says so  and I confess I am rather worn out.'

And then Olga pounced on me and carried
me off to my room. How cool and comfortable
it looked! My last impression as I fell asleep
was the remembrance of Olga in her white

gown closing the brown shutters, while a bee
hummed lazily about her.

The next few days passed quietly. At first,
Olga and I shared the night-nursing between
us ; but one morning I again proposed to Mr.
Dodd that Reggie should be moved to La
Maisonnette, and to my relief he made no
objection.

It would be so much easier,' I said ; ' I could
have him in my own room, and then there
would be no need for any more sitting up. It
is not necessary now, but I do not like leaving
him.'

I think the other way would be preferable,
and you have had enough inconvenience. Miss
Leigh was talking to me yesterday; she is afraid
you will be knocked up. Suppose you talk to
Mr. Fleming about it. You could easily have
the boy well wrapped up and carried across.
I dare say his father would look after him all
right ; but after such an attack he will be weak
for a long time, and a woman's care is best in
such cases.'

I had made my plans, and the next morning
I spoke to Mr. Fleming ; he owned that it
was a good idea. Reggie would be safe with
me, and I should be spared all fatigue.

Oh yes, of course it would work excellently
only '

Only you do not feel you can bear to part
with the boy ?'

Oh, it is not that,' he returned In a tone of
great embarrassment ; ' I should be quite happy
knowing he was over there and well looked
after. It is only  well, I must say it ;' and then
he blurted it out with difficulty : ' Miss Seton,
you have done enough for me  too much. Last
night I could not sleep for thinking about It all
how I was ever to repay you. Oh, it Is not
so much the money I mean  I could work for
that ; It Is the kindness, the goodness, and all
for a stranger ! Am I not right in saying it is
too much ?'

I do not regard you as a stranger !'

Well, perhaps not ; but all the same I have
no right. Look at the nights you have sacrificed,
the discomforts you have had, and you have
been accustomed to such luxuries. Oh, I know ;
Miss Leith has told me !'

Miss Leigh is a sad chatterton, I am afraid.
Well, then. If these are your only objections,
Reoforle can be brought across at once.' He did
not answer. ' Mr. Fleming, 1 should so like
to have him, and so would Olga.'

1 am sure there were tears in his eyes, for
he turned away and walked to the window, but
still he did not speak.

After a minute I followed him.

It shall be just as you please. Pray do not
distress yourself ; but I thought by this time
you would look on me as your friend. There
is no question of that sort between friends  only
that one loves to take trouble.'

He turned round at that.

'As though you have not taken trouble
enough ; as though you had not grown pale
with watching over my boy. I think the
angels, if there are such beings, must be like
you and Miss Leigh. There, I will not hold
out any longer ; it is only my pride  because I
hate to receive everything and give nothing.
Shall I bring him now ?' but I told him there
was no hurry for an hour.

His little bed was all ready, and by-and-by
he was carried across in his father's arms.
Olga had dressed the room with flowers. The
shutters were open, and one could see a vista
of green leaves interlaced with slanting sunbeams
; some climbing roses peeped in at the
open window. As Mr. Fleming laid him down,
I saw a lovely little smile flit across the white
sunken face ; but Reggie was too weak to express
his satisfaction in any other way, only he held his
father's hand tightly, as though he feared to lose
him.

I closed the door and left them together.
Olga and I sat together for a long time in our

pretty salon, talking over the strange week we
had passed. Olga seemed as though she could
not make enough of me.

Aunt Catherine,' she said softly, as she
looked at me, ' do you know how tired you
look ? You have lost your nice, pretty colour,
and it is all with nursing Reggie. I do not
wonder a bit that Mr. Fleming is so grateful'*

I think the hot weather has tried me ; but I
shall be able to rest now. Olga, you have no
idea how thoughtful Mr. Fleming is; I never
saw anyone so unselfish. He says that he will
not be in our way at all, and that if 1 will let
him spend an hour with Reggie in the morning,
and another in the evening, he will be quite
content  that he is perfectly happy to let me
have him.'

I suppose he means to resume his old
Bohemian life at the pavilion ; it will be very
dull for him.'

We cannot help that,' I returned quickly.
Olga, I have been wanting to ask you something
for days  how long will Jem's holiday
tutorship last ?'

Only for another week, Aunt Catherine.'

Well, do you know, my dear, I have been
thinking that it would be a good plan if I were
to ask Jem to join us here. I shall still have to
leave you so much alone, and if I have to stay

here much longer, they may be wanting you
back at FIrcroft, and then Jem will be useful as
an escort.'

I saw her colour rise, but she answered with
her usual gentleness :

Oh yes, and Jem may be able to help you.
You must do as you like about all that, Aunt
Catherine. I am very happy here, and it will
be hard to leave you and Reggie ; but if you
think it best  well, of course it is for you to
decide ;' and then, as we heard footsteps moving
overhead, we said no more on the subject.

VOL. II. 25

LA RUE d'eGLISE.

We arc ourselves
Our heaven and our hell  the joy, the penalty,
The yearning, the fruition. Earth is hell
Or heaven.'

The Epic of Hades:

I HAD not made this suggestion about Jem
without a great deal of thought ; but it seemed
to me the only way of solving my difficulties
with regard to Olga. Reggie had wasted away
to a little skeleton, and it would be weeks before
he regained strength. During that time I should
be responsible for him, and as most of the
nursing would still devolve on me, Olga would
be left a good deal alone. Once or twice the
thought had crossed my mind that one of the
sisters from the hospital might be induced to
take charge of Reggie ; but when it came to the
point I felt reluctant to give him up. He was

SO little trouble now ; and I had Olga to help me.
As he grew better he would lie happily for
hours playing with the flowers his father
brought him, or cuddling a tiny white kitten
that Olga had discovered about the place.

Mr. Fleming kept strictly to his two daily
visits, and I generally took advantage of them
by indulging in a stroll with Olga to our
favourite point. During the remainder of the
day he walked or sketched, or sat reading in
the kitchen-garden. He had meant to resume
his old Bohemian life  dining at a restaurant, or
preparing his own meals ; but I had taken all
these arrangements into my own hands. I could
not bear to think of him shifting for himself ;
besides, I knew his purse was growing empty,
and he could not leave Reggie and go back to
work. I had secured a helper for Jeanne in the
person of a stout, bright-eyed girl, who was
just then looking for a situation. Her name
was Marie, and, among her other duties, I gave
her the care of the pavilion, as Madame Perrot
still wantonly neglected her lodger. During
its master's brief absence she swept and dusted
and kept it tidy. Marie, too, conveyed his
meals across to him when Olga and I sat down
to ours. I was afraid every day that he would
remonstrate with me on the subject, and kept
purposely out of his way ; but for a little while

252

he held his peace. But one evening he left off
playing with Reggie rather earlier than usual,
and followed me into the garden. I saw directly
by his manner that he wanted to speak to me,
and I determined to give him the opportunity.

Have you said good-night to Reggie, Mr.
Flemings ?'

Yes ; Miss Leigh is with him. I took the
liberty of asking her to go to him. Miss
Seton, there is something 1 must say to you :
how long is this sort of thing to go on ?'

Do you mean about Reggie ? Mr. Dodd
thinks that I may bring him downstairs tomorrow
; the change will be good for him  he
is going on so nicely ; but of course he is still
very weak.'

Oh, it is not about Reggie ! that is not
what I mean, at all ; but how long am I to goon
living on your bounty ? Do you know,'
and here a dark flush crossed his face  a flush
of bitter humiliation, ' that I wrote last week to
my wife for some money ? she has means of
getting it for me  for her brother is not poor ;
and her answer was  and of course he dictated
it : " You have played at being the idle
gentleman long enough ; it is time you and
the boy came back. George has no money
to spare just now. I wonder you are not
ashamed to ask him." I told her how ill Reggie

had been ; but she takes no notice. I dare say
she has forgotten all about it.'

Mr. Fleming, there was no need to write to
England. I can lend you any money you
want for present use.'

Do you think I would ask you to lend me a
franc ?' he replied ; and nothing could be prouder
than his look. ' Do I not owe you enough
already ?'

You owe me nothing.'

Oh no !' with a little laugh ; ' it is of course
absolutely nothing at all that you do for me ; it
is not the life of an enchanted prince that I
am leading at present  oh no ! When I come
in from my walk, I find my hermitage swept
and garnished ; not a speck of dust anywhere ;
fresh flowers ; a new book  even the paper.
Sometimes I catch a glance of the substantial-looking
fairy who had worked in my service.'

Oh, you mean Marie. Yes, she is a nice
creature ! and, then, she finds so little to do
here."

Once I had to cater for myself ; to go into
cheap restaurants ; to boil smoky water for my
coffee ; to fetch my own milk and eggs from the
farm ; now I sit in my garden with my hands
folded and wait. I know that at an appointed
hour Marie will appear with her tray. I shall
dine and sup like a king ! my coffee is fragrant

and rich with cream ! Miss Seton, 1 ask again
how long is this going on  how long ?' and here
he drew a long breath. 'Am I to receive and
not be suffocated with all this kindness ?'

I would not answer him lightly  he was too
much in earnest for that.

Mr. Fleming, do you know I think the
generosity is on your side, not mine? You are so
good to let me have Reggie ; we were growing
dull at La Maisonnette, and a child is such a
boon to two women, and you never complain
now of being lonely without him.'

I hope I am not quite so selfish as all that,'
he replied gravely ; * but. Miss Seton, there is
one thing more that I must ask. Reggie is so
much better now, and yet Mr. Dodd comes to
see him every day, and it will not do to run up
a long bill.'

Do not trouble yourself about that,' I replied;
that is my affair.'

I do not understand,' he returned ; and I
could tell at once by his manner that I had
said the wrong thing, for he seemed to stiffen
in a moment. ' I hope you do not mean that
Mr. Dodd will not wait a little until I can
settle his account ; there will be no difficulty
about that matter if he will only give me time ;
there are ways and means, and I am not afraid
of work.'

Mr. Fleming,' I said after a moment's
hesitation, for I did not dare pursue that
subject, ' you have never told me vhat your
business is. I hope I am not impertinent in
asking ; but I know you will give me credit
for a good motive.'

You have asked rather an awkward question,'
he returned with a quick, nervous laugh.
I belong to the unemployed at present. When
I first went to Oxford, it was with the intention
of studying for the Bar ; but, like a fool, I
threw away all my prospects in life by marrying.
Oh ! I must tell you about all that some
day. You should hear it all now, only I have
to go down to St. Croix for that medicine
Mr. Dodd forgot to bring, and it is growing
late ; but I can tell you as much as this : when
I committed that cursed folly of marrying at
one-and-twenty, I had to take the first thing
that offered  a mastership at Highgate. The
pay was poor enough ; but we managed to live
within our means, until Aline  well, never
mind about that. I had to throw it up in a
hurry, and then we had to fall back upon her
brother.'

Do you mean that you lived with him ?'

Yes ; Aline is there now. He  Mr. Barton
is not a gentleman ; he does not understand
how a man of my education feels about things.

His business  well, it is retail, and,' with a
proud curl of his lip, * it was not likely I could
mix myself up with that sort of concern. Of
course, there are misunderstandings ; we are
not on the same plane, George and I ; but, in
his way, he is good to us. He is trying to get
me a clerkship now, as other things have failed;
so I am only doing a little literary work at
present  writing articles for one or two papers :
sometimes they give me a book to review. I
am expecting to be paid for one or two things
soon ; that is why I asked Aline to advance me
the money

Then, in that case, Mr. Fleming, you can
surely allow me to be your banker ?' But he
only shook his head.

People who live like enchanted princes do
not require a very long purse,' he returned,
with a smile. ' I am my own banker at present;
I only wish you to know the real state of affairs.
Now I must go. When may I talk to you
again ?'

Shall we go on the common tomorrow
evening ? perhaps there may be a sunset.'

'Very well, then; I will fetch you. I must
wish you good-night now.'

He looked at me wistfully, and a great sadness
seemed to come into his eyes, but he did
not say any more. The next minute the little

gate swung back on its hinges, and I saw him
striding down the path towards the pavilion.

The next morning, as I was sitting with
Reggie writing my letters, while he played
with some paper figures his father had cut out
to amuse him, Olga came quickly into the
room.

Aunt Catherine,' she said, and there was a
little excitement in her manner, * I want to
speak to you a moment. Do you know Monsieur
Lefevre has come back, and that his
brother is dead ?'

I almost started at the name. Reggie's illness,
and my interest in Mr. Fleming, had
made me almost forget why I had come to St.
Croix ; but with Olga's words came a sudden
rush of recollection.

How do you know ? who has told you ?'
for to my knowledge Olga had not quitted La
Maisonnette that morning.

It was Marie. I was talking to her just
now while I warmed Reggie's beef tea  you
know I like to air my French, Aunt Catherine
and Marie is a nice, sensible girl. We were
talking about St. Sulpice, and she had been relating
some wonderful legend about that image
of the Madonna and Child in the Lady Chapel,
and then she mentioned Pere Lefevre's name.
"He told me that when I confessed to him

on Friday," were her words. Of course I
questioned her very closely ; and it is true :
he came back last Wednesday, his brother is
buried, and they had Masses said for the repose
of his soul at St. Sulpice. Marie said Pere
Lefevre looked very worn and sad.'

Olga, I must go to him this afternoon !'
I knew you would say that,' she replied.
Oh yes, you must go, Aunt Catherine, and I
will take care of Reggie.' And then she continued
gently : ' It seems as though we have
forgotten Basil lately ; but it is not really so,
only dear little Reggie has engrossed all our
thoughts.'

That was true, but I would not allow that
Basil had been forgotten. I could not eat my
luncheon that day, and the moment it was over
I set off for St. Croix, quite disregarding Olga's
entreaties that I would walk slowly and not
fatigue myself. What did fatigue or heat
matter if only I could come at last face to face
with Pere Lefevre, and learn from him whether
Basil were dead or livings ! I recall that walk
now with a feeling of surprise. I was so sure
that Monsieur Lefevre would help me. I had
no fears, no misgivings ; the time of suspense
was over. In a day or two Virginia would
know all  whether she were the mother of a
living son or not.

I remember, as I climbed the steep cliff path,
how beautiful the bay looked beneath me. The
children were playing on the yellow sands, filling
their little pails full of bright amber seaweed.
I could hear them calling to each other. By-and-by
I passed the hospital and the cemetery ;
a young widow was kneeling beside one of the
graves. How long that walk seemed to me !
but at last I reached La Rue d'Eglise, and
stood again before the tall, narrow house. It
seemed months since I last stood there talking
to the solemn-faced young priest. The friendly
housekeeper seemed pleased to see me.

Ah ! here is madame again she said
with a smile, ' and le bon pere is actually within.
That is well, after the many times madame has
been turned from the door. Ah, there is need
for patience in this world !' Would madame
enter at once ? and she would tell her master.

I stood for a minute in the little dark
passage. I could hear her talking volubly, and
a man's voice answering. Then she returned,
and ushered me into a small room with
a window overlooking St. Sulpice. Pere
Lefevre was writing. He rose at once, with a
profound bow.

Madame has desired to see me,' he said ina
smooth, polished voice, as he offered me a
chair. * I fear, from what Martha tells me,

that my long absence has been of great inconvenience
to madame. Alas ! affairs not of my
ordering have detained me ! Such things are in
the hands of le bon Dieu.'

I looked at Pere Lefevre as he delivered
himself of this little speech. He had a meagre,
spare figure, but his face was pleasing ; the
dark, sunken eyes were keen and intelligent.
He was evidently a gentleman. His manner
was suave and gentle, and at once put me at
my ease. Perhaps he saw how nervous I was,
for he went on to speak of his brother's death,
and gave me a little sketch of the end, which
enabled me to recover myself.

And now madame must tell me how I can
serve her,' he said at last.

In reply, I gave him a brief summary of our
history. I told him Virginia's sad story ; the
misery of her married life ; her flight to England,
and desertion of her child ; her diseased
and lifelong terror of her husband.

If she could only be certain of his death, I
think there would be some peace for her remaining
years,' I observed in conclusion.
And if she could only gain some clue that
might aid her in her search for her son, it
would give her fresh life.'

And her husband's name is Paul Lynd-
hurst ?' he asked as soon as I had paused. He



had listened to my story with grave attention.
Only once, when I first mentioned Paul's name,
he had looked up with a surprised air, and his
keen glance seemed to read me through and
through. ' It is very strange,' he muttered ;
and then he had composed himself to listen.

Yes, monsieur,' I returned, in answer to his
question ; ' and the report has reached us that
you attended his death-bed.'

Did your informant state where Monsieur
Lyndhurst died ?'

He believed at a village near Geneva ; but
there is no one of that name interred there
the whole account is confused.'

Monsieur Lefevre shook his head.

I was never in the neighbourhood of Geneva
in my life. Madame's informant is altogether
wrong. Paul Lyndhurst  le bon Dieu have
mercy on his soul !  lies in the cemetery at St.
Croix. Madame may see his grave there if
she will.'

I clasped my hands ; the blood seemed to
rush to my heart.

Mon pere, is this really true . Oh, it is
grievous to rejoice that anyone is dead 1  but if
you only knew !'

My daughter,' he said kindly, ' it is not
always easy to grieve when death takes our
enemy. Human nature' is weak. We are not

all saints. I know enough of this unfortunate
man to understand what you feel.*

But when  when did he die ?'

He thought a moment.

I should say it was nearly ten years ago.'

Ten years ! Virginia had been free ten
years, and we had not known it !

Shall I tell madame what I know ?' And,
as I looked at him imploringly, he went on :
It was after vespers one evening, as I was
leaving St. Sulpice, that an old peasant woman
accosted me. I knew her by name ; she was
old Nanette Duclos, who lived with her half-witted
son in the little tumble-down cottage in
the narrow alley that leads out of the Rue
Dominique. It has been pulled down long
since. She had a strange story to tell me.
An Englishman, an artist, was lying ill  she
believed dying  in her house. He had been
seized with a sort of fie at her door a week
previously, and, with the Divine charity one
sees among the poor, she had nursed and
tended him ever since.

'' Mon pere, he is not one of us ; he has
known better days," she said. " He cannot eat
our food, and all he asks for is brandy ; and he
is dying ; and he does not believe in le bon
Dieu, or in the blessed Mary. And he lies
there cursing, and no one can make him be

9b

silent. And he has almost frightened my poor
Pierre to death."

I went with her at once, and I found Nanette
had not exaggerated matters. When I stepped
up to the miserable bed, and looked in the face
of the man who lay there, I knew at once that
he was dying.'

Mon pere, will you describe him to me ?'
My daughter, it is not easy after all these
years, and I have seen many dying men since ;
but I can recall a little. It was a handsome
face  the features finely cut, but wasted by
disease, and with all the evil passions stamped
on it. He looked fiercely at me as I entered.
*' What do we want with priests ?" I heard him
say ; " I never believed in them."

I had some difficulty in entering into conversation
with him. His manner continued defiant,
and his oaths and curses made one's flesh
creep to hear him; but our Holy Church teaches
us how to deal with such cases: I must win him
through his miserable appetites. I gained his
attention at last by promising to send him a
better bed, and, if the doctor permitted it, some
good wine.

He ceased to glare at me ; a more human
expression came over his face. ' Why, you are
not such a bad sort, after all !" he said, with an
air of extreme surprise. '' I never thought a

French priest could be such a sensible fellow.
Come ! I call that behaving like a gentleman.
Now, I don't mind entering into a compact with
you. Just see after a few comforts for me, and
I will undertake to listen to as many sermons as
you care to preach to me."

I knew better than to argue with him.
There was a fierce, unsettled light in his eyes,
which resembled insanity. I thought it prudent
to return a soothing answer, and withdrew under
the plea of bringing the doctor. When I returned
it was with a physician ; but, as I surmised,
there was little to be done.

'eyes, he is dying, poor fellow!" was his
report as he joined me in the room below.
This is a case for you, not me. He cannot
last many days."

" Is it your opinion," I asked, '* that the man
is deranged ?''

He shrugged his shoulders. '' It Is not his
fault that he Is still sane ; he has drunk pretty
nearly all his senses away. As far as I can tell,
he has lived on brandy, and nothing else. He
is calling out for It now."

'* You do not mean that I am to give It
him ?"

'certainly  but In small doses  unless he Is
to collapse at once. I tell you, the poor wretch
has made It his food for months ; he will suffer

tortures for the want of it ; and, after all, nothing
matters now ; he is a dead man."

** In that case, I will give him a little," and I
went up at once. He almost snatched the cup
from my hand in his wolfish eagerness. *' Oh,
that is good  that is life !" he cried, as he
drained it. " Give me some more, and I will
call you a good fellow!" But he swore at me
when I carried the bottle away.

Madame, I need not trouble you with all the
miserable recital. We poor priests know how
hard it is to win these wandering souls. He
was a great sinner ; but God is good, and I
would not lose hope. I surrounded him with
comforts : he had a clean bed, fresh linen ; one
of our good sisters nursed him ; we induced him
to take a little soup ; the doctor had given him
an anodyne ; he suffered less ; his temper improved.
Sometimes he would talk to me ; by
degrees I got him to tell me his story. My
daughter, some things I regard as under the
seal of confession. A life such as his could not
be edifying.'

I understand, Pere Lefevre, far too well.
Heaven forbid that the evil record of Paul
Lyndhurst's life should pollute a woman's ear !'

The good father went on :
By degrees he softened perceptibly. My
attentions pleased him ; he was grateful for the
VOL. II. 26

alleviations and comforts 1 was able to procure
for him. In spite of his recklessness, a terror of
the black future that yawned before his sinful
soul at times haunted him ; then he would speak
to me of the past.'

Did he mention his wife ?'

'A little. He told me one day he had
married a ounce English heiress for her money;
and that, to his disgust, her father had disinherited
her. " She was a handsome girl," he
observed ; " but I was never in love with her,
I cared far more for the little Pauline I deserted.
She was always whining about her own people.
I grew weary of her at last. It was a mistake
for a man of my calibre to tie himself down to
matrimony ; she lost her good looks, too, when
the boy came. Ah, well ! I was drunk one
night, and I believe we had a bit of a quarrel.
Anyhow, she left me with the brat on my
hands, and that is all I knows about it.' '

But, mon pere, why did he not seek her for
his own interest ? To be sure, my father was alive
for many years after that, and would have protected
her against him ; but, still, it seems strange
that he should have made no attempt to possess
himself of her fortune.'

I believe he was hopeless on the subject, and,
as you say, madame, your father lived for many
years after your sister returned to him. As far

as I can make out from a very disjointed narrative,
the unfortunate man rejoiced in his freedom ;
the child was an incubus, but he bore with him
for a time, intending by-and-by to rid himself of
him by sending him back to his mother. Meanwhile,
things went on from bad to worse ; his
habits grew more depraved ; he had an attack
of delirium tremens, and was removed to a
hospital. On his recovery he suddenly remembered
his boy ; from the first he had taken
very little notice of him, and but for the care of
the faithful bonne the little creature would have
fared badly. He was told now that during his
illness they had been befriended by an English
clergyman who was travelling for his health ;
that this unknown benefactor had literally fed
and clothed the child, and that a strong affection
had grown up between them ; and that this
good friend desired nothing less than to take
the boy back with him to England, and to
bring him up as his adopted son.

I will give you Paul Lyndhurst's own words :
" I was glad to be rid of him ; and a feeling
of revenge against the woman who deserted me
made me determined not to send him back to
the Hall. If Virginia wanted him, she must
make terms with me, Paul Lyndhurst. I
wanted to go into Italy, and a child and nurse
were not to my taste. I had an interview with

26  2

his reverence, and in the end I said, ' Leave
me your address, and when I want Basil I will
send for him ; until then you are welcome to
him;' for, you see, I did not mean to part with
the boy out and out. One day he would be
rich  I did not forget that."

And now I am coming to the strangest part
of all. By his own account, Paul Lyndhurst
lived a wild, reckless life in Rome and Naples,
but one day he heard of the death of his
father-in-law ; it had happened long before, butin
his wanderings the news had failed to reach
him.

If his father-in-law were dead, Basil  his son
Basil  must be his grandfather's heir. He
must claim him at once ; there was no time
to be lost. Madame, this wretched man was
actually on his way to England to seek his son
when his fate overtook him, and he was taken
ill at Nanette's door.'

Men pere, tell me quickly the name of the
clergyman.'

But Pere Lefevre shook his head.

My daughter, how am I to tell you ? No
names were mentioned at all between us.
With the cunning that seemed to belong to
him, Paul Lyndhurst never once pronounced
the name of his father-in-law, the Hall, or
the English priest. "To-morrow you shall

write to his reverence," he said. '' No, I have
no address about me ; but I never forget
anything. Yes ; tomorrow you shall write."
Alas ! madame, when the morrow came the nurse
who was sitting by him heard a slight sound,
but before she could reach him he was dead !'

Dead I Oh no, mon pere  not without
telling you where Basil was ?'

Alas ! yes, my daughter ; we burled him here.
Paul Lyndhurst  that was all we could put.
We could find no trace of writing  nothing
that could prove his wild story. Sometimes I
have imagined it was the creation of his fancy
the outcome of delirium ; there were times
when he did not seem sane ; how did I know
whether this Basil had an existence? Just to
satisfy my conscience, I inserted in an English
paper the death of Paul Lyndhurst, and added
my name ; nothing came of it, and voila tout,
madame.'

He looked at me compassionately, as though
he feared I should be overwhelmed with disappointment
; but I started from my seat.

Mon pere, it was an English clergyman
who adopted Basil ?'

Yes, certainly ; so it was affirmed.'

Then in that case it will be easy to discover
Basil. We can advertise ; there can be no
difficulty in that ; our lawyer shall put the

matter in hand at once  it shall be in every
paper ; Basil's adopted father will soon be
found. Oh, I have hope now !'

It would be better still if madame could find
the bonne. Oh, if we only knew her name !'

Ah, as to that, mon pere  Lizette must bean
old woman now. Perhaps she is not living.'

What name did you say, my daughter ?' he
asked quietly.

Lizette Dupont.'

There was a woman of that name living
with her grand-daughter in the Rue Anglaise.
Tenez, madame. permit me to ascertain
whether she be still living. If you will give me
your address, I will write to you.'

I gave him the address, and with many thanks
took leave of him. The good old man accompanied
me to the door, and gave me his blessing.
It was too late to do anything more ; tomorrow
1 must visit the cemetery and read the name,
Paul Lyndhurst, for myself; but now I must
return to La Maisonnette. Olga would be
growing uneasy at my delay. A fiacre passed
me ; I hailed the driver and jumped in, and
throwing myself back on the shabby cushions, I
closed my eyes wearily, and gave myself up to
reflection on the miserable story I had just
heard.

THE EPIC OF HADES.

'To cure thee of thy pride, that deepest-seated ill,
God humbled His own self  wilt thou thy pride keep still ?

God humble, and man proud ! Do angels, when they range
This earth, see any sight at once so sad and strange ?

He knew, who healed our wounds, we quickly should be fain
Our old hurts to forget  so let the scars remain.'

Archbishop Trench.

x\s we drove down the lane I saw Olga standing
at the gate. Her white gown and great red
umbrella had quite a picturesque effect. She
had a bunch of yellow roses in her hand ; behind
her were the brown gate and the sycamore-tree.
The shutters had all been thrown back
to admit the fresh evening breeze. Windows
and doors were open, curtains fluttering. As
I walked up the courtyard I had glimpses of
the shady garden. Jeanne was coming from

the well with a green and yellow niche. Her
apron was filled with corn for the fowls. I could
hear them clucking in expectation.

Olga drew me into the drawing-room. The
little tea-table stood in one window, the big
easy-chair beside it ; there was a perfume of
roses, and heliotrope, and mignonette. Olga
put her arms softly round me.

How tired you look, Aunt Catherine ! and,
yes, you have been crying ; your eyes are
quite wet. What is the matter, dear? Is it
another disappointment ? and you have been
so long away  all the afternoon !'

I put up my hand to my face in some surprise.
Were my eyes really wet ? I knew nothing
about it.

Oh, it is all so sad,' I replied with a sigh ;
and Pere Lefevre could tell me so little about
Basil : only that when he was quite a baby 
at least, not more than two years old  a clergyman
took him to England and brought him upas
his own son.'

I saw Olga start ; she was pouring me out
some tea, and her hand trembled so that she
spilt some.

Oh, how awkward I am !' she said with a
little laugh ; but her face was quite pale ; ' but
of course you know the clergyman's name ?
Pere Lefevre will have told you.'

That is just what he does not know himself,'
I returned in a vexed tone  'neither his name
nor the place where he lives. We shall have to
advertise in the Times and the Guardian, and,
indeed, in all the papers, until we find Basil's
adopted father ; but there is one thing I know,
Olga, that, if you will, we may stand together
tomorrow at the grave of Paul Lyndhurst.'

Is he buried here ?' she asked in an awestruck
voice. ' Oh, then, you have learned something
this afternoon ? Oh yes, we will go, and
then you can really tell poor Mrs. Lyndhurst
that you have seen his name, and that she need
not fear him again. I think that she has never
quite got rid of the terror that one day she
might see him.'

I know it was her mania ; no one could
persuade her out of it; that was why she would
never leave the Hall for a single day. Poor
dear Virginia ! Dr. Langham said at last that
it was hysteria ; her nerves were too much worn ;
she could not be reasonable ; but, Olga, think
of the pity of it : he has been dead ten years,
and Virginia did not know'

Ten years ! do you think you can tell me all
about it: Aunt Catherine, or are you too tired .
Mr. Fleming is with Reggie, and he says that
I am to let him know if you wish to go out with
him this evening. It is not yet six; but if you

are too tired ' and she looked into my face

very gravely.

Oh, it is impossible ! I could not listen to
him to-night,' I said wearily ; * I should bethinking
of that miserable story I have just
heard, and how we are to find Basil. Mr.
Fleming will not mind if I put him off until
tomorrow.'

He will not mind at all,' she returned quietly ;
it must be as you like, Aunt Catherine.'

Then I would rather talk to you instead,'
was my reply, and as she placed herself beside
me, 1 related all that Pere Lefevre had told me.
Olga was always a good listener. It was not
her way to interrupt people ; but now she sat so
motionless, with her face half hidden by her
hand, that once or twice I stopped in my narrative.


Go on ; please tell me all,' she would say
when I paused, and I would take up the thread
again.

It is horrible  horrible !' she exclaimed when
I had finished ; * how can there be such God-forsaken
souls anywhere when,' dropping her
voice reverently  'when Christ has died. How
very difficult life is, Aunt Catherine ! One
cannot understand.'

'It is a mystery,' I returned ; ' there is so
much that is unknowable. Some of us have to

Stumble on in darkness all our lives ; the light
is hidden from our eyes. How do we know ?
Just at the last God may have spoken to him ;
He may have heard and answered. It is never
for us to judge between the most sinful soul and
its Creator.'

You are right, Aunt Catherine. I like your
merciful creed : people are too prone to judge,
to pronounce condemnation. Do not talk about
it any more ; I can see how it has tried you.
There is something I want to show you that I
think will interest you. Mr. Fleming lent mea
book to-day, because he said I should be dull
without you, and he brought it across this afternoon.
It is the '' Epic of Hades." I remember
you liked it so much ; but I have not read
a page yet.'

'It is a very good book,' I replied as I took
it carelessly. Evidently Olga wanted to distract
my thoughts ; but I was not in the humour
to discuss the ' Epic of Hades.' I opened it
at random, just noting the pencil-marks on the
margin of the pages ; favourite passages had
been underlined. It had been well read. At
last I turned to the title-page, and then an involuntary
exclamation escaped me. Olga was
watching me ; she drew a long breath of relief.

You recognise it, then, Aunt Catherine }'

Recognise it ! how many years had passed

since 1 had seen that handwriting ? Six-and-twenty
years  nay, more  and I had been a girl
then ; but I knew it at once. It was not a
handwriting that could be easily forgotten. It
was characteristic of its owner  large, benevolent,
and yet a trifle angular, betraying a
marked individuality and originality.

Basil Fleming, from his affectionate friend,
Robert Lucas Fleming, St. Mark's, Leeds.'
This was all.

Olga left me and went outside for a few
minutes. She wanted me to recover myself ;
but I could only sit there looking at that one
name  Robert. I was impatient at myself at
last at this emotion after half a lifetime of
silence. Oh, what fools we women are ! The
hair grows gray while the heart is young ; there
are wrinkles on the face, and the pulses still beat
as quickly. Why are we so slow to learn our
lesson  that youth has fled and taken all
our precious things with it ; that between us
and them there is a gulf fixed ? It was not the
Robert Fleming I once knew who had written
those few words. This was an older Robert 
a man who had grown gray in his Master's
service. Only his handwriting was the same.

Good-bye, Catherine  my Catherine,' had
been his last words to me ; ' it is not God's will
that we should be happy together ; not yet  not

in this world. Let us try to submit ourselves ;'
and then he had left me. Had he lived single for
my sake, as I for his, or had any other woman
become dear to him ? He had not married, that
was all I knew.

'Aunt Catherine,' and Olga touched me
gently, * do you feel better now ? Oh, I know I
have given you a shock ; and his name is Basil.'

I was so bewildered that I could not take in
her meaning. I read the inscription again :
Basil Fleming, from his affectionate friend,
Robert Lucas Fleming.' To be sure, what
could it mean }

Is it  can it be Basil  your Basil, Aunt
Catherine T she whispered in my ear.

I put my hands on her shoulders, and almost
pushed her away in my excitement. I did not
seem as though I could understand, and yet

Do you not see,' she continued gently, ' how
strangely it all seems to fit in ? K clergyman
in England has adopted him ; he may even
have given him his name. It is your Mr.
Fleming, and perhaps Basil '

But I would not let her go on.

How do we know ? Olga, it is not possible !
Why do you excite me like this ? Are there
no other Basils in England ? No, you must
not delude me with such hopes !'

But if it be true, Aunt Catherine?'

How do I know that it is true ? How do I
know anything until he tells meP Oh, I was
wrong to say I would not go out with him ! I
cannot sleep until he answers this question :
What have he and Robert Fleming to do with
each other ?'

Dear Aunt Catherine, you shall ask him that
question ; but you must not agitate yourself like
this. You will frighten Mr. Fleming, and he
will not know how to talk to you.'

But, Olga, if what you suspect is true, and
he is really Basil '

And then I could say no more, but could
only cling to Olga and weep ; for it seemed tome
as though it could not be true that Providence
had not this rich gift in store for us; that
it must be a dream, a hallucination ; that, after
all, we must be deceiving ourselves. Robert
Fleming might only be a friend  a chance
acquaintance. Were there not other Basils
in England ? I was so shaken, so bewildered
with it all, that I could only cry softly to
myself.

Olga behaved beautifully ; she made me lean
against her, and only said a quiet, soothing
word at intervals. It might not be true ; I
must not distress myself; but it would be nice
to hear about an old friend, and perhaps Mr.
Fleming could tell me about him ; * and even

even if he be the wrong Basil, perhaps your
Mr. Fleming will help you to find him she
finished.

Just at this moment we heard footsteps descending
the little wooden staircase. I sat up
at once and tried to compose myself, and Olga
looked at me in a questioning manner.

Shall I call him ?' she whispered ; but as I
hesitated the footsteps came nearer; there was a
quick, light tap at the door, and Mr. Fleming
came into the room.

Reggie is asleep,' he began, * and I wanted

to know ' and then he stopped and looked

at us both. * I am intruding ; you are not well.
Miss Seton. I beg your pardon.'

'Aunt Catherine is very tired,' whispered
Olga.

She wished to shield me, but I put her aside
almost impatiently.

'What does it matter if I am tired? Mr.
Fleming, I should like to walk with you to the
Point ; the air will do me good.'

Are you sure that you are quite fit for it ?'
he returned, with such an air of concern that
the tears rushed to my eyes again. 'Something
has been troubling you. Miss Leigh
looks anxious with a quick glance at her.

Olga's colour rose a little, but she was quite
equal to the situation.

You are right ; Aunt Catherine has been
agitated. She has much to trouble her. If
she would only keep quiet until tomorrow ! but
it is for her to decide.'

I should like to go,' I replied quickly ; but
my limbs trembled as I rose from my seat.

I saw Olga and Mr. Fleming exchange looks
but neither of them said a word. Olga brought
me my bonnet, and wrapped a little shawl round
me, and Mr. Fleming quietly gave me his arm.

Perhaps the air will be the best tonic, after
all,' he said, as we turned into the field-path ;
but I made no answer.

The book was still in my hand ; I was thinking
how I could ask him that question. Mr.
Fleming became silent in his turn. We passed
the firs, and strolled quietly down the little path
that led to the Point. As soon as we had
reached it, he spread the rug Olga had given
him, and then placed himself at my feet. The
shore beneath us was strangely still this evening
; the tide was low, and the stretch of
yellow sands, with the gray boulders and masses
of bright-coloured seaweed, seemed bare and
empty ; one could hear the soft lapping of the
water. A bell was tinkling from the hospital
on the cliff; a little boat with a red sail was
coming across the bay ; the opposite shore
seemed bathed in a strange silvery light. Mr.

Fleming drew his gray cap over his eyes ; a
long sigh escaped him.

'And I have to talk about myself?' he said
in a voice of suppressed bitterness.

'Yes,' I replied; 'but not just now. *I
want you to tell me something else first ;' and
I pushed the book towards him as I spoke.
I want you to tell me how you came to know
Robert Fleming }'

My question seemed to surprise him ; he
looked at the inscription, and then at me.

Do you know him ?' he asked in a tone of
excessive astonishment. ' He has never spoken
of you to me  never; and I knew all his
friends.'

Perhaps not. I have not seen him since
I was a girl ; it is not likely that he would
mention me. But this is not the question.
What I want to know is your relationship
to Robert Fleming.'

Then I will tell you in a few words. In one
sense there is no relationship between uS ; in
another, I owe him everything. When I was
a child  a poor neglected little creature with no
one to care for me but an ignorant peasant
woman, who was my bonne  he adopted me,
educated me, and brought me up as his own
son. My dear lady, what ails you } you are ill !
please let me fetch Miss Leigh '

VOL. II. 27

No, no !' I gasped ; * it is nothing ; let me be
quiet a moment ; it will pass ;* but as I hid my
face in my hands a sob escaped me. ' O my
God ! it is Basil,' I said to myself, and a sort
of giddiness came over me. I had a dim consciousness
that my hands were drawn away
very gently, and that my dear boy was chafing
them in his own.

They are icy cold,' I heard him murmur ;
what can be the matter ?'

After a time I recovered myself Yes, I could
listen now ; the faintness had passed.

I am better,' I said, trying to smile. ' I am
so sorry I frightened you. I suppose Olga was
right, and I have tired myself.'

But you will let me take you home now ?'
he said in a caressing voice.

Not for worlds I replied firmly ; ' it was
only giddiness; it has quite left me. I am
perfectly comfortable here with this nice stone
to rest against, and it is so quiet. I am longing
to hear your story. When Mr. Fleming
adopted you, did he give you his name at the
same time ?'

I will tell you all I know ; but that is very
little. Mr. Fleming was travelling abroad when
he found me. He noticed me first, and then
the people of the house told him about me.
My father was in a hospital. I had no one

belonging to me but my bonne ; the poor
creature was in great trouble and perplexity.
She had no money, and but for the kindness of
strangers we should have starved. " I permit
them to occupy the garret," the mistress of
the house told him ; '' but I tell Lizette that
she must apply to the Maire. I have children
of my own to clothe and feed." I was too
young to remember this time ; but Mr. Fleming
has often recalled the day when he came upto
our garret, and how I ran across the floor
to him and clasped him round the knees, and
called him daddy.'

" My heart went out to you then, Basil,"
he has said to me since, " when I lifted you
up and you laid your dark curly head against
me, and I felt your childish arms round my
neck. We were fast friends from that hour,
and never a day passed without a visit to the
garret."

I was a mere baby ; but I certainly remember
a tall man who took out his watch to
show me, and who brought me playthings and
bonbons, and how I climbed on his knee, and
called him daddy.

One day he took me in his arms. '' I am
your father now, Basil," he said to me ; '' you are
given to me." Later on, when I could understand,
he explained to me that my own father

27  2

had gone away, and had given me into my
friend's keeping.

 " You are to Hve with me, and be my little
boy until he comes to fetch you," that was all
he ever told me of my father ; and once, when I
asked why my name was Fleming, he told me
my father had not wished me to bear his name ;
but he never hinted at any reason.'

'And Mr. Fleming brought you to England
?'

Yes, and 1 remember I was sea sick, and
cried for my bonne ; everything else was indistinct.
One of my earliest recollections was
playing with a Dandy Diamond called Pepper
on the hearth rug, and of a nice motherly
young woman whom I called Martha, and who
washed and dressed me with her own children.
And I remember that I always slept in a little
bed in Mr. Fleming's room, and that I cried
if the watch were not under my pillow  but I
shall weary you ?'

No, no ! if you only knew how every little
detail interests me !'

You are very good to listen to me at all,'
he replied in a low tone ; ' but I need not
linger over these early days. Mr. Fleming
had brought me to his own lodgings. He
lived in a road leading to St. Mark's. It was a
high narrow house, and had a long strip of

garden at the back, where we youngsters played.
Mr. Fleming lives there still.'

'And he is still the curate of St. Mark's.'

Yes,' with a quick glance at me, as though
my trembling voice arrested his attention, ' he is
the senior curate ; there are two others ; it is a
large parish, and a very poor one. Once or twice
a country living has been offered him ; but he
has always refused it. He says he will live and
die at St. Mark's among his poor people. I
have heard it said that when Mr. Career dies
he is the vicar, and an old man now  the
bishop will offer the living to Mr. Fleming.'

Will he accept it ?'

Most certainly he will ; the position will just
suit him ; there is not a man, woman, or child that
he does not know, and they are all devoted to
him. " Our Mr. Fleming," that is what they call
him.'

And all these years he has been poor ?'

Not so very poor,' he answered quickly ;
he had a little money left to him before he
adopted me, and this enabled him to send me
to a good school, and afterwards to Oxford.
He grudged me nothing, and yet he spent
absolutely nothing on himself.'

'And he is living still in the old house at
Gresham Street ?'

Yes, do you know it ?' in some surprise.

No. 27; and Martha still takes care of him.
Her husband is dead, and all her children except
Patience are married and out in the world.'

And you have lived with him there all these
years, Basil ?'

The name escaped me involuntarily. I saw
him look at me, and a smile came to his lips.

How strange to hear you call me that ! but
I like it  I like it.*

I beg your pardon I returned in some
confusion.

Do I not tell you I like it ?' was the reproachful
answer. ' I wish you would always
call me Basil. Yes, I lived with him off and
on until I married. We were very comfortable;
we had a big room running from front to back.
Mr. Fleming kept all his books in the back part,
and we called it the study. We had a round
table and some big arm-chairs in the front part,
and that was our dinner-room. I never seemed
to interrupt him ; he would write his sermons
while I smoked or played with Scamp, who
was Pepper's successor. When he came in tired
from his labours in the parish he always
seemed to like to see me there. " There you are,
Basil," I can hear him say now ; 'just help me
off with my coat, there's a good lad, and let us
be comfortable." Oh, those were happy days !'
he finished with a groan.

And he sent you to Oxford ?'

Yes ; I was giving him trouble, and he
hardly knew what to do with me. Public-school
life had turned me out a restless, conceited
sort of fellow, with a strong belief in my
own brilliant abilities, and a lofty disdain for
what I called narrow opinions. My success at
school had spoilt me. I had grown up self-willed,
with a dangerous love of pleasure, and
a decided tendency to choose my friends for
amusement rather than edification ; any opposition,
any attempt to guide and restrain these
weak and evil inclinations, only irritated me;
even the mild advice and loving admonitions
of my dearest friend only excited my impatience.
I remember how often I ended an argument
with the remark, '' We of the younger generation
think otherwise, Mr. Fleming. Thank
goodness ! we live in a more enlightened age,"
and I remember how his grieved silence was
his only answer.

I had gained a scholarship, and as my great
wish was to go to Oxford and afterwards to
study for the Bar, it was decided that I should
go to Exeter. The evening before I left Leeds
he spoke to me with unusual seriousness ; he
mentioned my faults one by one, and implored
me to struggle against them ; he warned me of
the temptations of University life. ' Your pride

and love of popularity will lead you into danger,
Basil," he said. "With your pleasure-loving
temperament, and, pardon me if I speak plainly,
your self-indulgence and dislike of denying
yourself any present gratification, you will
certainly fall into serious difficulties unless your
corrective be hard work and the friendship of
men worth knowing. My boy, for eighteen
years you have been my one thought ; do not
disappoint me !"

I was in a softened mood that evening, and
I listened to him with unwonted patience. I
remember telling myself as I went up to my
little room that he would have reason to be
proud of me  that I would distinguish myself at
Oxford. 1 fell asleep and dreamed 1 was on
the Woolsack. I was full of spirits the next
morning, and quoted the dream as a favourable
augury of the future. Mr. Fleming only shook
his head.

'' My boy," he said sadly, '* I do not believe
in auguries ; I would rather have you
a good man than see you Chancellor of
England"'

He was right,' I murmured.

Yes, he was right, I know it now; but I was
a self-willed young fool then ; I would not learn
my lesson until bitter experience taught it tome.
At that time I preferred the devil's teaching.



Miss Seton, it was an evil day that I
went to Oxford ; but I mean to pass over my
year at Exeter very quickly. I do not wish to
shock your ears, and the retrospect of this part
of my life is very painful to me.'

THE END OF A SUMMER Idol.

I require no argument to urge mc to be kind to a pretty
woman.'

 Fair Maid of Perth:

A wilful man must have his way."

The Antiquary:

All this time the strain on my mind and
attention had been terrible. I had followed
every word with famished eagerness. How
often in the old days had I wearied Heaven
with prayers that the silence between us might
be broken, and that I might at least have the
consolation of hearing something of the life
Robert Fleming was leading. But it is one of
the sad mysteries that seem to wall in human
souls in tangible darkness that such prayers are
often left unanswered. And yet if we would
only wait long enough, if the precious ointment
of our faith were not all poured out upon
our idols, if we could believe that the blackness

of our cloud would be relieved by a silvery
lining, if we would possess our souls in patience
instead of lashing them into wild rebellion, it
might still be well with us !

Oh, it was easy for the middle-aged Catherine
to preach philosophy ! But for the young,
girlish Catherine, stretching out her hands with
pitiful yearning for the birthright of happiness
the rightful heritage of her youth  it was not
quite so easy. One cannot see through blinding
tears. A bruised heart cannot moralize.

If only Basil would have told me more !
Oh yes, I called him Basil to myself with a
strange thrill and lingering over the word ! I
hardly dared look at him for fear he read the
truth In my eyes.

You are my boy and hers !' That is what
I longed to say to him. But I must hear his
story first. If only he would have told me
more of that life in Gresham Street ! But,
with a man's impatience of details, he was
hurrying on to a more marked episode of his
existence. I noticed that as he began to speak
again he turned his face aside ; but I could see
his features working. A sombre and gloomy
light had come Into his eyes.

I commenced my University life with Mr.
Fleming's warning ringing in my ears. Before
many months had passed it was more than

verified. I was considered the most popular
man in college. I had a host of acquaintances,
but few friends. Sober-minded reading men
avoided my company ; but all the wild, versatile
youths gathered round me, and helped me to
waste time and substance. Not in the riotous
living of the prodigal  thank Heaven I never
fell so low as that !  but in unprofitable discussions,
in festive gatherings that unfitted me
for my work.

Many of my friends were unsettled in their
views ; to them there was nothing sacred in
heaven and earth. 1 did not openly avow
myself an Agnostic, or a follower of the black
philosophy, but the simple truths I had been
taught by a good man seemed to shrink into
nothingness. " What do we want with creeds ?''
they would say. " The people are not to be
led in leading-strings any longer : natural religion
is all that we want." Oh, it makes me
sick to remember the cant phrases of our soulless
philosophy  utter negation, absolute impossibility
of knowledge, of the finite mind
measuring the infinite ! This is what we taught,
fools that we were  sifting our puny knowledge,
as the child digs his little pit in the sand
to hold the ocean !

When I went home for my first vacation,
Mr. Fleming received me with an air of restraint.

He looked worn and anxious, and,
though his affection for me was evidently the
same as ever, the old unrestrained intercourse
seemed impossible. Often I saw him look at
me sadly, as though he were waiting for my
confidence, but no word of reproach passed his
lips. Alas ! for the first time, I was eager to leave
him. The quiet atmosphere seemed to stifle me.
I longed for my lawless freedom and brilliant
debates  the society of my so-called friends.

I had one friend in particular, Stewart
Morton. He was a man of some consideration
; his family was old and wealthy,
but his father and brother were well known for
their freethinking opinions. Stewart had
already made his mark at Oxford. He had
undeniable abilities, he was clever and witty,
and his brilliant conversation and attractive
person blinded people to his faults ; but, as a
man, he was wholly without principle. I was
in the habit of taking long walks with him,
partly for exercise, and partly to carry on those
discussions in which we both delighted. His
dangerous sophistries were rapidly undermining
my moral nature.

After a time his stronger intellect dominated
me. But for Stewart Morton I should never
have met my fate. One afternoon, or really
early evening, we found ourselves in a village

some miles away from our college. We were
tired and hungry and thirsty, and even Stewart's
brisk tongue had flagged a little. We were
sauntering down a field where some haymakers
were at work. One of these, a girl, attracted
our attention. She was moving slowly between
the cocks, raking up the loose hay. She wore
a blue cambric dress and a white sun-bonnet.
There was something regal in her gait ; she
looked like a princess who was playing at
being a rustic. As we passed her, she leant
on her rake and looked at us.

*' By the powers, what a beautiful girl !" observed
Stewart In my ear. " What a subject
for an idol ! by Jove ! yes, and I will speak to
her ;" and, prompted by mischief, Stewart put
his words into practice.

Taking off his hat with his finest air, he informed
the girl that we had lost our way, and
were weary and starving. Was there a farmhouse
near where we could obtain refreshment ?
And then he added, with glib falsehood, that
his friend, pointing to me, was just recovering
from an illness, and that he feared the effect of
the long walk before us in our present fasting
condition. I saw the girl look at me. She
had large soft eyes, like a gazelle, with a sort of
appealing sadness in them.

*" There Is Mr. White's house," she returned 

the red-brick house you see yonder ; they are
very kind, hospitable people. I am staying
with them. I do not think they would refuse a
glass of milk to a stranger ; shall I go and ask
them ?" with another shy glance at me.

'' May we go with you ?" suggested the young
hypocrite ; " you can walk as far as the house,
Fleming, can you not ?"

'' Oh yes !" I returned rather sulkily, for his
little fiction displeased me. There was no need
to have invented that story of my illness ; but
Stewart was in one of his mischievous moods.

"your friend does not look delicate, "observed
the girl in some surprise. She spoke in a low,
deep voice ; the accent was not perfectly refined.
As she spoke she took off her sun-bonnet
and fanned herself with it, as she walked
between us. She was wonderfully handsome.
The shape of her head was beautiful, and there
was something classical in the smooth dark
hair, drawn off the white forehead and coiled in
glossy plaits behind. Her figure was large, but
finely moulded, and there was an air of gravity
about her that added to my interest in her.

' He is not naturally delicate," commenced
Stewart provokingly ; 'but an illness always pulls
down a fellow. You are pretty fit now, aren't
you, Fleming  only in a starving condition ."

'What more he meant to add is buried in

oblivion, for at that moment a stout comely
woman, with pink ribbons in her cap, came out
of the farmhouse.

' Whoever are you bringing along with you,
Aline ?" she asked in a puzzled tone, shading her
eyes from the sun ; but before the girl could
answer, Stewart, hat in hand, was beside her.
I heard the explanation again  long walk ; two
undergraduates ; one of them recovering from
an illness ; impossible to get him back without
refreshment ; he would not answer for the consequences.


" Dear sakes ! just hear him," she interposed
in quite a flurry ; '' poor young gentleman ! Isn't
it lucky, Aline, I have just masked the tea ? I
am sure you are welcome, gentlemen, if you will
honour us by sitting down with us. White !"
bustling into the passage, "wherever is that man,
I wonder ? White, here's company ; two of our
Oxford gentlemen dead beat and fasting. Aline,
get some more plates, and tell Jane to dish up
that ham. You are kindly welcome, young
gentlemen !"

I do not know how Stewart felt, but I was
tolerably ashamed of his wholesale fibs, as these
kind, homely creatures dispensed their simple
hospitality. Mr. White, whose florid face
matched his wife's ruddiness, shook hands with
us heartily.

" It Is not the first time that young puss,
AHne, has brought in gentlemen," he said with
a wheezy laugh and a knowing wink at the
girl.

I thought she looked distressed ; she
coloured and went out of the room without
speaking. On her return she sat down opposite
me and began to cut bread-and-butter. I could
not take my eyes off her. It was not so much
her singular beauty that charmed me as her
gravity, her silence, and the strange pathos of
those dark eyes. Once or twice as she looked
at me a sort of shiver passed over me, a thrill
of expectation that went through me. Now
and then she offered me something ; but I
noticed she never spoke or looked at Stewart.
He was chattering in his clever, heedless way
for the benefit of his host and hostess. Now
and then the farmer leant back in his elbow-chair
with a loud guffaw that made the tears
run down his cheeks ; but Aline never smiled.
When tea was over, I was standing by the
window a moment, when Aline suddenly paused
beside me.

'' Have you been ill ?" she said, fixing her
strange eyes on me.

'' No," I returned in a vexed voice ; " it was
only his nonsense. I have never been 111 In my
life."

VOL. II. 28

*' I thought so, you looked so strong ; then
you do not tell stories like him ?"

I shook my head, and then added hastily :

" He meant no harm, it was only his fun ; he
is really very nice when you know him."

" Humph ! I think I like you best," she replied,
and an odd little smile played round her lips ;
and then she leant out of the window and
picked some roses.'

My poor boy, I can imagine the rest,' as he
paused to take breath.

Yes, it is easy to imagine it,' he returned
hurriedly, ' if you had only seen Aline that
evening ; it was an idol  it fascinated us both ;
that dark wainscoted parlour  the girl in her
blue dress, offering us the roses. 'will you
come again ?" that was what she said to me as I
went out dizzy and bewildered with the novelty
of my sensations.

" What a Ruth !" observed Stewart as we
walked down the lane. " I wonder if there bea
Boaz in the background  my lady Ruth
favours you, Fleming. I heard that pretty
whisper just now ; I am half inclined to cut
you out, only, you see, I am so uncommonly
good-natured. Go in and win, my boy; it will
be rare sport to watch you  hay making and
syllabus ; tea and ham in the parlour. I
had no idea you were such a gay Lothario."

It was profanation to hear him talk like this.
Must there always be a Mephistopheles when
Faust meets his Margaret ? Those deep sad
eyes haunted me ; the touch of the cool, soft
hand still lingered in mine. Hitherto I had
been fancy free ; for the first time I felt the
tingling of a new passion in my veins. That
night before I slept I determined to see her
again, and without Stewart.

From that day I took solitary walks, and
they invariably ended at Cross Farm. I had
always a kindly welcome from Mrs. White and
her husband ; I think they were proud of the
handsome girl who was their guest, and a suitor
or two were to be expected. They made no
objection if I invited Aline to take a stroll with
me in the fields to admire the sunset ; sometimes
she walked back through the lanes with me.

Aline always blushed with pleasure when she
saw me, but after the first few minutes she invariably
relapsed into gravity : she spoke little
except in answer to my questions ; but her
manner was full of intelligence, and she never
repelled me by any vulgarity. She was not a
gentlewoman by birth ; that was evident to meat
once. She told me frankly that her brother
her only remaining relative  had a small
shop in Holloway.

 " George is very kind to me, but I find the

282

life dull," she said once. " I do not like serving
in the shop  the people stare so ; I tell
George I want to be a governess, but he will
not hear of it. He has sent me here that I
may get rid of the idea, and also because he is
angry with me ;" and her eyes filled with tears.

How I longed to kiss them away ! But that
evening she would not tell me the reason of her
brother's anger. At times her sadness  her
utter despondency  infected me ; I felt as
though I were under the influence of some
power that I could not resist. There were
times when I thought I was not in love  when
I wanted to break away from her and be free ;
sometimes I would part with her almost coldly,
but in a day or two the desire to see her again,
to be near her, would be too strong forme.


I knew nothing of her real character ; she
was reserved with me ; she neither invited nor
permitted any love-making on my part ; she
liked me, and frankly told me so, but there was
no coquetting on her part.

One day I had driven over to spend an hour
with her, when I found her looking flushed and
excited ; I thought her manner strange.

"George is a tyrant !" she said, as I asked
anxiously what was the matter. '' He insists
on my marrying a man old enough to be my

father. He Is a grocer, too, but in a large way.
He says I have given my word to marry
him."

" Is that true, Aline ?"

" Yes, it is true," she replied, bursting into
tears ; " but I would rather die than marry him.
Basil, if you care for me, why do you not save
me from George ? I cannot keep my word  I
should murder Nathaniel or myself. Oh ! you
do not know, but it is almost driving me out of
my mind ! and, Basil, you know you care for

J)
me.

" I love you, dear," I returned passionately,
for she was clinging to me, and sobbing like a
broken-hearted child, and her beautiful face was
wet with tears. How could I know ?  I was
only one-and-twenty, and I was not one who
knew the ways of women. If I had been a

little older But there, let me hurry on.

I have not been the only headstrong young
fool who sold his birthright for a mess of
pottage.

We settled it all before we parted. The
long vacation was approaching, and, contrary
to Mr. Fleming's wishes, I had accepted an
invitation to stay with Stewart Morton ; his
people lived at Wormwood. Aline was going
back to Holloway. Nothing could be easier
than to procure a license and marry her in the

old church in Holloway Road. Her brother was
a Dissenter, and so was Nathaniel Jennings.

We parted from each other very tenderly ;
I believed, that day at least, that I was
ready to lay down my life for Aline Barton.
I took Stewart Morton into my confidence;
he seemed a little alarmed at the notion of a
marriage.

*sit will hinder your prospects in life," he
said ; "Is there no way out of this ?''

I almost quarrelled with him at last ; he
wanted to teach me a little bit of worldly
philosophy. He did not believe in women ; in
his opinion, flirtation was a venial sin. If I
had listened to him '  and here his face darkened
* but I could not unlearn the lessons of a life.
I silenced him at last by telling him roughly
that I chose to be a fool rather than a knave ;
no woman should ever rue the day she saw
me ; that I was madly in love with Aline, and
that I meant to make her my wife.

He was a little sulky at first ; but finally
promised to see me through it, as he called it,
and I accompanied him to Wormwood. I only
saw Aline two or three times before we were
married. We met on Sunday evenings in the
old parish church, and had a stroll together
afterwards. She was very quiet and subdued,
and very grateful to me for the sacrifice I was

making, and each time I left her I was more in
love than ever.

Stewart did not see her until the day we
were married, and then he vowed to me in the
vestry that he had never seen a grander-looking
bride ; and certainly Aline looked her best that
day. Her face was colourless, and as she stood
at the altar, with downcast eyes and her deep
lashes sweeping her cheeks, she was more like
a lovely statue than a woman. Once only she
raised her eyes to me with a frightened look ;
it was when I was promising to love and
cherish her until death. I felt her hand
tremble in mine then. I had taken lodgings
at Highgate ; through Stewart Morton's influence
I had secured a mastership there.
Aline was not quite penniless ; she had two
or three hundred pounds. It was not until
the day after my marriage that I wrote to Mr.
Fleming. It was rather an off-hand letter; I
was too proud to show feeling. I had no reply
from him ; but one day, when I returned from
my morning's work, I found him sitting with
Aline.

The sight of him took my breath away ;
for a minute I could not speak. He had been
ill  he looked thin and worn ; but he stretched
out his hand to me with his old kind smile.

** So you could not trust me, Basil ?" he said,

as Aline put down her sewing and went quietly
out of the room.

I could make him no answer ; for the first
time the consciousness of my own base ingratitude
to this generous benefactor filled me with
shame and remorse. How had I repaid this
dearest friend of mine for all his loving sacrifice ?
By disappointing all his hopes of me ; by flinging
up my prospects in life, and uniting myself
to a woman whom a few short weeks of matrimony
had convinced me could never be my
equal or companion ! I stood before him confused
and guilty  a prodigal weary already of
his husks, yet for whom there could be no consolation.


*' My poor bo)' ! we must make the best of
it," he said presently, when, crushed and humiliated
by his goodness, my proud reserve gave
way. "You must be loyal to your wife, Basil.
Never let her think she is not your equal; if
she love you, she will soon teach herself to
become worthy of her husband."

He stayed with us some time, and shared
our mid-day meal with us. I remember how
patiently and gently he tried to win Aline's
confidence ; but she was in one of her strange
moods, and seemed to have taken a dislike
to him. She had already developed a singular
jealousy of my friends. When I remonstrated

with her after he had left, she said
sullenly :

" George Is every bit as good and forgiving
as Mr. Fleming, but you never ask him to take
a meal in the place. You hate to have anything
to do with him, because he Is not one of
your fine gentlemen !"

This had been our first matrimonial dispute.
Mr. Barton had behaved to us with tolerable
generosity. He had stormed a good deal at
first, and had called Aline in my presence a
sly, good-for-nothing girl ; but he had relented
at the sight of her tears.

'' You have treated Jennings cruel," he went
on ; " he is that cut up that he can't mind his
business, and all along of an ungrateful girl
who could not keep her word to him. You
have behaved as I never thought a girl could
have behaved ; but it is too late to cry over
spilt milk now, and what Is done can't be altered.
You have made your bed, and must just lie in It.
I wanted to tie you up to a safe man ; but you
have chosen to fend for yourself."

'' But you will forgive me, George ?" sobbed
Aline.

I hated to see her demean herself to such
a fellow ; why, he could not even speak his
own language, and he was a little insignificant
sandy-haired man. The very look of his glossy-black

clothes turned me sick ; how could he be
Aline's brother ? But they were evidently fond
of each other.

'' Come, come," clapping her roughly on the
back, "don't spoil your eyes with crying; least
said soonest mended. We must make the best
of a bad job. Bring your husband to have potluck
with me on Sunday, Allie ; and we will
have a crack together."

Oh, how I grew to loathe that little parlour
behind the shop, and those Sunday dinners ! I
put a stop to them at last. " If you choose to
have George here, well and good," I said one
day; 'but I am not going to Holloway every
Sunday; you may go by yourself;" and Aline
sulked, and retaliated by turning a cold shoulder
to my friends. Before long I went of my own
accord to Holloway. I must tell my story in my
own way. I hate this part of my life so much
I can hardly bear to speak of it. It was a
drenching November evening. I stalked into
the shop, looking, I suppose, as cheerful as the
Ghost in " Hamlet." George, who was adding up
accounts in his little desk, turned pale when he
saw me. " Come into the parlour," he said ;
'' Smith will mind the shop." I followed him
in  I was benumbed with wet and cold ; and he
drew up a chair to the fire. " Sit down and have
a warm, Fleming," he said quite kindly, though

we were not the best of friends. " Susan will
bring up the tea-things in a minute ; but there
is something you want to tell me first ?"

" Yes, George."

He rubbed his hands nervously together ;
his lips twitched. " You aren't going to tell
me that Allie has broken out again ?" he said ;
** don't tell me that, for heaven's sake !"

I turned and looked at him sternly ; he must
have seen the loathing in my face, for he put
his hand on my shoulder,

*' Don't, old chap ; keep it in ! Allie is your
wedded wife, you know. A man is bound to
bear with his own flesh and blood."

*' If I had known it "  and here I turned on
him so fiercely that he recoiled a step or two 
*' I would have died sooner than marry your
sister."

*' Aye, aye ! to be sure you would," he replied
pityingly; "but Nat was not of your
way of thinking ; he was that fond of Allie
that he would have taken her in spite of it.
That was why I wanted him to have her,
because he knew all about it. If you had come
to me and said, ' Barton, I am in love with your
sister I would have told you the truth, and
there would have been an end of it, and Allie
would have stopped with me or married Nat
Jennings."

* George, what am I to do ? I shall go mad
if this goes on ; I have no control over Aline."

" What are you to do ? that beats me, old
fellow ;" and he sat down opposite to me and
shook his head disconsolately. '' She has been
a handful to me, that poor girl has ; but for
all that, I never wanted to get rid of her. She
is all I have belonging to me ; for I never mean
to have chick nor child of my own. Somehow
I have always turned against thoughts of matrimony
since my cousin Jenny died. Allie has
been like my own child, somehow ; for there is
twelve years between us ; and I couldn't blame
her as I should have done, when 1 remembered
mother."

I looked at him aghast.

'' Do you mean T'

He nodded. " Yes, mother and father too ;
but mother was the worst ; she died of it at last.
I always thought father took to it just out of
misery at her goings on. Jenny lived with us
then, and folks thought we should have married
each other, only she caught malignant small-pox
nursing a lite servant who was taken ill, and
that carried her off."

" George, how old was Aline when you first
saw signs of this fearful habit ?"

" Well, it might have been a matter of two
years or so now. I thought I should have

broken my heart that, night when I found it
out  such a bonnie lass as she was, and so
good-humoured and kind when the madness was
not on her. Look here, Fleming, I can't stand
seeing her own husband turn against Allie.
When she was at her worst, and had got to the
drink, I was never hard to her. How could
she help it, poor girl, when it was in her blood ?
It was just a madness, and she knew it herself.


" ' George,' she would sav in one of her
penitent moods, ' it comes over me just like
madness. I seem to have no power to fight
against it. Sometimes I pray about it. but it
always masters me in the end. I hate myself
for it ; I want to be good, and to have people

love me. Perhaps if I go away somewhere

Why don't you lock me up, and save me in
spite of myself?' Poor Allie! she would be
good for a long time after one of these breaks-out
 that is why I wanted Nat Jennings to be
her husband, because he would have had more
patience with her." '

CHAPTER VIII.

ALINE.

Yet, if I seem to speak of grief,

'Tis scarce worth wonder. I have known
Large losses, dealt in moments brief,
Hide harvests ere their autumn strewn.'

Philip Stanhope Hartley,

'My career has been one of difficulties, and doubts, and
errors.' ' Guy Mandarins.'

At this point Basil's voice suddenly dropped,
as though he were weary. He rose and began
pacing up and down the narrow point, as
though he could no longer control his restlessness.
I watched him without speaking. How
I longed to stretch out my hand to him, to bid
him be comforted.

Do not lose hope. You are one of us ;
you are no longer alone in your wretchedness
you have a mother.'

Oh, if I might only say that to him ! But

he must tell me all first. My poor boy ! So
this was his deary fate  to be linked for life to
this woman. What bitter news for Virginia !
What perplexity for all of us ! The moon
was rising now, and the pale silvery beams
began to play over the water ; the air was
soft and balmy, and the only sound that
reached our ear was the faint ripple of the
waves on the sand. Basil suddenly came upto
me.

Are you cold or tired ?' he asked abruptly.
Miss Leigh told me to take care of you.
Would you like to go in now, and let me
finish this miserable story tomorrow T

1 could not sleep until I had heard all you
have to tell me. Sit down, my  Mr. Fleming.
Do you think my heart is not full of pity for
all you have suffered ? Do you think I do not
understand T

It was my own fault,' he returned huskily.
I deserved to be punished, but at times it has
seemed to me as though the punishment were
greater than the sin. I was so young, so
horribly young and inexperienced, and  and I
thought I loved her.'

Did you not T

I do not know  perhaps ; but my love, such
as it was, died a natural death very soon after
our marriage. Aline had not been my wife

three months before I discovered her fatal
habit. I had thought her strange once or
twice  a little excited in her manner ; but that
night  shall I ever forget it ?'  with a shiver.
I had been spending the evening with Stewart,
and had come home late. As I walked up
Highgate Hill in the starlight, I thought
rather tenderly of my wife. I had not seen
her since the morning, and she had seemed a
little depressed then.

" I do not like you to be out so much,
Basil," she had said to me. " There are times
when I am afraid of being left to myself. If
1- had said that to George, he would have given
up any pleasure to stop wich me."

I disliked this allusion to her brother, and
answered her rather coldly :

** George Barton and I are very different
men. I am sorry you feel dull, Aline, but I
cannot break my engagement with Stewart."

" That is what you always say," she returned
rather sullenly. "You care for Mr.
Morton more than you do for me ; and yet I
am your wedded wife. I am not clever and
amusing like your other friends, and so you get
tired of me."

'' I wish you would not talk such nonsense,
you silly child !" I replied, trying to laugh off
this. 

But Aline was not to be soothed. She did
not return my kiss as usual, and though she
followed me to the door she had no parting
smile or word for me. I thought privately that
she was in a bad humour. Her absurd jealousy of
my Oxford friends already tried me a good deal.

I always let myself in with a latch-key. It
was long past midnight, and I was surprised to
see a light burning in the parlour. How foolish
of Aline to be sitting up for me ! I thought ; and
yet the little attention pleased me. I went in
with a smile on my lips. What a sight met my
eyes ! The fire was out, one guttering candle
was on the table ; the other had burnt itself out.
Aline was lying half across the table, with her
flushed face pillowed on her arms. Could she
be asleep  ill ? What did that strange spirituous
smell mean ?

As I stood on the threshold unable to realize
the true meaning of the case, she opened her
eyes, and with a stupid, vacant stare came unsteadily
across the floor to me. Good heavens !
I believe that sight nearly drove me mad in my
horror. I pushed her from me with a curse, and
she fell heavily to the floor.'

You hurt her, Basil !'

Nothing hurt her that night. She only
grovelled at my feet, and begged me not to
be angry, but I was almost beside myself. I

VOL. Ti. 29

dragged her up, and made her go up to her
room, but I had to carry her at last. I saw
her throw herself upon her bed, and locked
her in, and went downstairs. I spent the remainder
of the night walking up and down
like a caged thing. How was I to bear my
life beside her? Miss Seton, I believe only
one thing kept me from blowing out my brains
in the cold gray morning, and that was the
thought of my adopted father. How could I
bring this grief on him ? No, I deserved
punishment. I must bear the hideous fate I
had brought on myself. I must bear with the
woman I had made my wife. Yes, it was the
thought of that true gentleman, Robert Fleming
 his tender love, his stainless life  that
shielded me in that awful hour, and brought me
to my knees sobbing like a child.

I left the house the next morning without
seeing Aline. I had my school duties to perform.
When our little maid brought in my
breakfast, I told her to look after her mistress.
* I am afraid she is ill," I stammered.

When the time for my return approached,
a feeling of disgust and sickness oppressed me.
As I drew near the house my pace slackened.
How was I to confront Aline ? She did not
come to meet me as usual. I had not expected
it. The little parlour was in its usual order.

The fire burnt brightly. A shaded lamp was
on the table. The kettle was hissing and
bubbling on its brass trivet. The tea-things
were arranged. A little bouquet of chrysanthemums
and brown leaves lay beside my plate.
An appetising smell of hot cakes came from the
kitchen. For one moment I felt as though the
hideous spectacle of last night were a dream.
Then Aline entered.

She came up slowly to the table, and stood
leaning on it with one hand. She looked very
white and ill, and her eyes were swollen with
weeping.

*' Basil " she began, and then stopped

as though afraid to say more.

" What have you to say to me ." I asked
sternly ; for even her grief-stricken aspect did
not soften me in the least.

" I have to ask your pardon," and then,
bursting into wild weeping, she sank on the
floor before me. '' Oh, Basil, Basil, don't be
so hard with me ! I have tried ; indeed, I have
tried ; but the temptation was too strong, and
you left me alone. Oh, I would rather you
killed me than look at me like that, as though
you loathed the sight of me ! It is not my
fault  ask George. George knows, and he is
always so good to me. Oh, why did I ever
leave him ?  why did you make me care for

29  2

you ? I ought not to have let you marry me,
but I was so afraid that George would force me
to have Nat Jennings."

" Aline, will you get up and listen to me ?"
" No, not until you say you will forgive me.
Basil, you are my husband. You must help me
to overcome this dreadful habit. I am young  7
I must get over it. I will  I must. I hate
myself for doing it, but now and then the devil
tempts me. Basil dear, only forgive me this
once, and I will never offend you again."

What could I do ? She was my wife, and
she looked so lovely, kneeling there with the
tears rolling down her face. How could I help
at last taking her in my arms ? She was so very
gentle and humble that night. She listened tome
as meekly as a child while I talked to her.
I told her that, of all sins, this was the most
repellant to me  the one I judged most harshly.

" Other vices are bad enough," I said ; " but
this degrades the whole moral sense. It drags
a man down below the level of a beast. Aline,
you have inflicted a fatal stab to my love. I
can never think of you as I did yesterday. If
this went on, I could not answer for the consequences."


" Would you grow to hate me ?" she whispered,
and a great sadness, almost a despairing
look, came into her beautiful eyes, and then she

covered my hands with kisses. *' Oh, Basil,
do not hate me ! I love you so much, and I
want to please you."

" Then you must promise me never to taste
the accursed stuff again. Promise me now,
Aline."

She gave me the promise gladly, and seemed
as happy as a child when I kissed her ; nothing
could exceed her sweetness that night. She
hung about me, and coaxed me all the evening.
George came to see us the next day, and on
the following Mr. Fleming surprised us by a
second visit I said nothing to either of them.
Aline was on her best behaviour. She was
gracious  charming. She sent George away
perfectly satisfied. Stewart called in the next
week, and she made much of him, and asked
him to come again. When he left, and I was
chatting with him on the doorstep, he said
to me :

'* I begin to think you are a lucky fellow,
Fleming ! That wife of yours grows handsomer
every time I see her."

A month or two passed in tolerable tranquillity.
I never left Aline now. I spent
the evenings reading to her. On half-holidays,
when I was free, I took her for a walk. I had
reason to be more than usually considerate ; we
hoped in the early summer that Aline would

become a mother. Her health was a Httle

delicate just now ; she was liable to fits of

depression, and I did not find it always easy

to cheer her. Once or twice, as the winter

went on, I had a vague suspicion that things

were not quite right ; but I was not sure. One

night I was detained at school, helping the

head-master with some accounts. I had begged

Aline to go to bed early, and she had promised

to do so. The house was quite dark, as I let

myself in, and I went softly upstairs. As I

entered our room, my heart died within me.

Aline was stretched on the bed fully dressed.

There was no need to ask this time if she were

ill. I did not disturb her ; cold as a stone, and

with a sense of despair that seemed to crush

the youth out of me, I went downstairs, and,

rekindling the smouldering embers, threw

myself down on the hearth rug, and lay until

morning.

The next evening there were tears and
reproaches again. Aline was so ill with her
penitence that I grew frightened at last. I
must be more careful with her ; but I was
losing heart now. On the third relapse, I went
to George ; I have told you how he comforted
me.

The summer came, and Reggie was born ;
and for a few months love for her child, and

gratitude for my attentions, kept Aline straight;
but by-and-by the old madness broke out again.
Alas ! I knew ndw that it was madness  an
hereditary taint was in her blood. We tried
every means, George and I ; we watched her,
kept her amused, and for two or three months
no one could be more reasonable. Then I
would leave her some morning standing smiling
at the door, with her boy in her arms, looking
like the picture of some grand, pale Madonna,
and in the evening she would meet me with the
raised look of a sleep-walker in her eyes.

How she ever obtained the drugs that were
destroying her we never knew ; but stories of
the lady at Myrde Cottage begun to be rife
in the neighbourhood. When things got worse,
I was obliged to resign my post ; the place had
grown too hot for us.'

But surely you let Mr. Fleming know of
your trouble ?'

He shook his head.

No, I never could bring myself to tell him ;
and after a time he discontinued his visits.
Aline had taken a strong dislike to him 
she was always susceptible to these strange
jealousies. At last I begged him not to come.

" We are better apart just now," I said ; " it
is not pleasant for me to see my friends ignored
by my wife, and I cannot bear to see you

treated as Aline treats you ;" and he acquiesced
sorrowfully.

I was glad when he kept vay ; I could not
bear that he should see my degradation. He
used to send me money sometimes, but I
always returned it. I would write to him now
and then, and tell him about Reggie  his
beauty, his cleverness, his winning little ways;
but I said little about my wife. After a time
my letters grew fewer. I told him that for
the present we were living with I\lr. Barton ;
but 1 gave him no reason for the change. He
wrote back and implored me to tell him more 
to come and see him  to let him assist me ;
but my answer was curt, and I fear ungracious,
and after that he let me alone.

Since I have been at St. Croix, I have
written and told him everything. When I
go back to England I mean to take Reggie
to see him.'

That is right,' 1 murmured.

Yes, better late than never ; poor old man !
he is terribly cut up about it all.

Well, it was after our babv-Qirl died that
George made us come and live with him. I
could not get another mastership, and was only
earning a scanty maintenance by writing articles
and reviewing books. Aline's few hundred
pounds had long gone. George represented to

US that he was not a rich man ; the shop at
Holloway was all he had.

" Allie is the only creature I have belonging
to me in the world," he said ; " and I can't see
her pinched while I am alive. If you can put
up with a humble place, Fleming, you are
welcome to what I have. Allie and the boy
will be safe with me ; and you will have a
roof to call your own while you are looking out
for work."

Things were at such a low ebb with us just
then that I could not well refuse George. My
affection for Aline was a thing of the past now,
and all my love was centred upon Reggie.
From babyhood he had been constantly with
me ; even before he could speak he would hold
out his arms, and cry to come to me. He soon
made it evident that he preferred my society to
his mother's. Sometimes I had to take him
out of his crib, and, wrapping him up in an old
shawl, carry him downstairs. Nothing else
would satisfy him, and he would lie contentedly
in my arms while I read or wrote until he fell
asleep. I never could quite understand Aline's
feelings with regard to the child. Sometimes
she appeared indifferent to him. Now and
then in her irritable moods she seemed as
though she could not endure the sight of him.
I believe that after a time she grew jealous

of my fondness for him, and never willingly
caressed him in my presence ; but more than
once, when she thought herself alone, 1 have
seen her snatch him up, and cover him with
kisses, while he struggled to get away from
her.

'' Mother kisses Reggie too hard," I heard
him say once.

We had a very good nurse for him for two
years. George's thoughtfulness provided this
comfort, for Aline could not be safely trusted
with the care of her child. Reggie was always
happy with her, and until she died '

I interrupted him.

Wait one minute, please ; I want to ask you
a question. Did Reggie call her mammy ?

Yes ; how did you know that ?' he returned
in surprise. ' Reggie was very fond of her.
I think he cared for her far more than for his
own mother, and it was a great loss to us when
she died, and George told us that he could not
afford another nurse. I was never happy then if
Reggie were out of my sight.

It cost me a bitter struggle before 1 could
make up my mind to go and live at Holloway ;
but I could not let Aline and Reggie starve.
The thought of the little parlour behind the
shop gave me a sick feeling. There was a
room upstairs with two windows looking down

on Holloway Road, which was given up to
AHne ; but all the meals were taken in the
parlour. Rebecca, the elderly maid-of-all-work,
who had lived with George for the last fifteen
years  a red-haired, large-boned woman  would
lay the table in her usual noisy fashion : the
willow-pattern plates, the big clumsy knives,
were repugnant to me. Rebecca's turned-up
sleeves, her dirty apron, her rough, uncouth
ways, were all separate sources of offence ; but
I learnt to be grateful even to Rebecca, when I
saw how wisely and kindly she dealt with Aline
in her attacks. She had a man's strength, and
would carry her in her arms like a child.

*' You may leave her to Becky," George
would say ; " Becky understands Allie perfectly."


My surroundings were intolerable to me. I
had been used to Mr. Fleming's refined and
cultured conversation, and my year at Exeter
had still more unfitted me for the society of a
man like George Barton. After a time I could
not endure my life, and I was obliged at last to
find a retreat where I could read and write
quietly without distraction.

In my walks about Highgatel had discovered
a little cottage where a worthy old couple lived,
with whom Reggie and I made friends. In
return for a trifling weekly sum they agreed to

allow me the use of an empty room. I sent ina
few articles of furniture, laid up a little store
of wood and coal in an outhouse, and every
morning, as soon as George and I had finished
our early breakfast  Aline never appeared until
long afterwards  I dressed Reggie, and we set
off for Laurel Cottage. We spent the whole
day there. On my way I purchased provisions
for our mid-day meal ; sometimes ready-dressed
from a cook's shop, or else I broiled our chops
or steak on an old gridiron Mrs. Jones lent
us.

Reggie played about happily while I wrote
my articles and reviews. When he was tired he
would clamber up on my knee and sit quietly,
turning over his picture-book. He quite understood
that I must not be disturbed. Sometimes
his head would drop against my shoulder and
his eyes close. I would let him stay until
my arm got cramped, and then lay him down
on a rug at my feet, where he would sleep for
an hour or two. He never gave me any
trouble, but always seemed perfectly happy and
contented. A few bricks, a Noah's ark, and a
little cart were his only playthings ; but when
it was warm enough he would be running about
the little garden half the day, building a grotto
with some oyster-shells, or digging beside old
Jones, and making belief to help him. Dear

little chap, he was just the sunshine of my
life ! I do think Aline was right when she said
once that he was more my child than hers.

Sometimes when I played with him, or
hunted butterflies, or picked flowers in the lanes,
I forgot all about Holloway ; but it was always
the worst hour in the twenty-four when I went
back to it. When the evenings were cold I
wrapped Reggie in an old rug and carried him
all the way home. He used to burrow in it like
a rabbit, and I could just see his bright eyes
peeping out of the folds. He never came to
any harm ; I think the free life suited him as
well as it did me.

George would look up and nod a welcome tous
as we passed through the shop ; but Aline
generally received us rather sulkily :

" So you have come back," she would say ;
I suppose Reggie wants his tea ;" but she
never seemed to take any pleasure in waiting on
him. Oftener than not, Rebecca would put him
to bed. Aline was not always disposed to leave
the warm parlour and the fireside. *' George
would be coming in for his tea," she would observe,
and he liked to see her there. It was
always George  never me or the boy. I used
to think at last she did not care for either of us,
and yet she was the mother of my Reggie !

I could not spend the evening, with George

coming in and out, talking to Aline as she
sat at her work ; the tingling of the shop-bell
and the footsteps of the customers irritated me
too much. Besides, Aline and I had little to
say to each other. I used to wait until Reggie
was in bed, and go up and say good-night to
him, and then go out and prowl about the
streets for hours. It was strange, lonely work,
but I liked it somehow. I saw plenty of life,
only it was of the humbler sort. Sometimes,
when the mood was on me, I would walk into
London. I never returned until late. Aline
was always in bed, but George would be sitting
by the fire smoking and reading his newspaper.
The remains of the frugal supper would be still
on the table.

" Help yourself, old fellow," he would say.
*' Allie has gone to bed, and I am just finishing
my last pipe. Becky has gone up, too, but
I will go down to the cellar and draw you
another mug of ale, if you want it."

Poor old George ! he was always the same
good-humoured and cheery, and ready at any
moment for a "jaw," as he called it, but I
would not often be drawn into an argument.
He was, like all Dissenters of his class and
standing, narrow-minded and intolerant and
full of prejudices. I used to compare him
sometimes in my own mind to Mr. Fleming,

or even to Stewart Morton, and wondered
what Stewart would have said to him.

I am afraid I treated him very badly, but
he bore all my snubs with the same cheery
good-humour. I think his one fear was that I
should break away from Aline altogether. He
had a sort of pride in his own way, and as long
as he could keep the peace between us, and
things were outwardly smooth, he seemed satisfied.
I am sure in his own heart he was sorry
for me. He never objected to my long absences,
and always explained them in his own fashion.
I heard him talking once to his friend Jennings.
I suppose the latter had been somewhat inquisitive.


" No, he doesn't work here. You see, with
the customers coming and going, there is no
sort of quiet. He has a room a little way out
where he writes ; it is like a gent going to his
office."

" But he is out all the evening, too. I
wonder Allie likes it !" replied Jennings, who
still took an interest in his former sweetheart.

I could have flung him out of the shop as I
heard him, but George did not seem the least
embarrassed by this cross-examination.

'* Well, you see, Nat, Ale is a sensible lass,
for all her failings, as is known between you and
me. She knows the lad is a good bit tried with

her goings on, and wants exercise after his
writing. He is a rare walker, is Fleming."

'' Humph !" was all Jennings' reply.

I wonder if George's explanation satisfied
him ; no doubt he thought 1 neglected Aline
shamefully. I was in a bad temper that evening,
and when George came into the parlour I
said a contemptuous word about Jennings.

" It strikes me as rather bad taste that he
should always be coming round after what has
passed between him and Aline," I said ; for a
man is always touchy about his wife, and
though I did not love Aline, I would not allow
any old sweethearts to come after her.

To my surprise, George quite brightened
up at my brusque speech.

" I don't mind your saying that a bit,
Fleming," he returned; "it shows you have
some sort of feeling for poor Allie. Bless
your heart ! Allie is barely civil to him ; she
never holds her head higher than when Nat is
here, so there is no call for you to be jealous.
With all her faults, she knows her duty too well
for that."

" Oh, don't trouble yourself," I answered
coldly. " I am not the least jealous of Nat
Jennings or of any other man."

" Of course not," he replied briskly. '' You
are quite right there, my lad, for Aline never

looked at any man but you  not in the way of
loving him, I mean. As for Nat  poor old
beggar !  I am precious sorry for him ; he can't
get over the loss of Allle. But there, it was
not to be, and Allie is safe with me ;" and
with a sigh he went off to shut up the shop.

Now  would you believe it ?  I was such a
fool that I must needs go upstairs and hector
Aline on the subject.

" Nat Jennings comes here too often," I
said to her. " I have just told George so. I
hate a fellow to come sneaking round where he
is not wanted."

'' There is no reason for calling him names,
or speaking to George, either ; and you will
wake Reggie if you talk so loud," was her only
reply, and I dropped my voice at once.

'* All the same, incline, I tell you I will not
have the fellow round here so often."

" You must tell George that," she returned,
with a dignity that somehow became her. " It
is not my affair, nor yours either  Nat is his
friend."

'but he used to be yours," I retorted
sulkily ; " what is the use of denying it ?"

Aline flushed. " What has come over you
to-night, Basil ? What does it matter to you if
anyone looks at me or not ? I thought that
sort of thing did not interest you much now.

VOL. II. 30

It is quite true I took up with Nat once to
please George ; but I never could fancy him, as
I told you. It is not likely I should trouble my
head about him now, when I have married
another man."

But I was not quite mollified. " That is all
very well as far as it goes ; but you see, Aline,
he may trouble his head about you, and I could
not put up with that for a moment."

She looked at me rather oddly, and the old

wistful, tender look came into her eyes. *' Thank

you, Basil, for caring about it so ; but there is

no need ;" and she turned away. I was half

tempted to follow her and give her a kiss, for

she had answered me gently, and looked like

the old Aline ; but she left the room. I think

things might have been a little better after that,

only a few days afterwards Aline had one of her

breaks-out, and then everything was wrong again.

My literary work had brought me in a little

money, and this summer I determined to give

myself a holiday. I told Aline that I was going

to take Reggie abroad. As usual, she made no

objection, and though George looked grave and

shook his head at the notion, I refused to

listen to him for a moment. " I must have

thorough change of scene," I observed irritably ;

for the last month or two I have felt nearly

mad. Aline will be quite happy with you ; she

will not miss the boy, and I must take him. I
could not go without Reggie."

'* It is not my place to find fault with you,
lad," he answered sadly. *' Yes, you may leave
Aie with me ; but you are wrong about her
not missing the child."

' Why, do you mean she really cares so
much for Reggie ?'

" Well, she is the little chap's mother, isn't
she ." with a rough sort of pathos. *' I tell
you what, Fleming : you don't understand Allie
as well as I do ; she isn't without her conscience ;
she knows what a burthen she is to you, and
she tries to make up to you by sparing Reggie.
Why, when you are gone she will just cry her
eyes out, and then fly to the drugs for comfort
; that is what she always does when she is
unhappy. I see you don't believe me, lad ; but
it is my opinion, and Becky's too, that she is as
fond of you both as possible. I have seen
her watching you when you and the little chap
were hugging each other, with her eyes quite
full of tears ;" but I would not believe him.
Aline showed no special feeling when we took
leave of her. Her eyes were quite dry when
she packed Reggie's things, and when I put him
in her arms, and he kissed and stroked her face
in his pretty way, she gave him back to me as
quietly as possible.

There ! I have told you all. I have kept
nothing back, Miss Seton. I am only six-and-twenty,
and yet my fate has been such that I
have grown weary of my life. O God ! when
I think of what I might have been, and what

I am ' and with a groan he was about to

spring to his feet ; but I laid my hand on his arm.

Basil,' I said, ' do not go yet ; it is my
turn now.'

YOU ARE BASIL LYNDHURST !'

Let us not burden our remembrances
With a heaviness that's gone.'

Tempest

Courage and comfort ! All shall yet go well.'

King Jo hn.

I HAD spoken In a somewhat agitated tone, and
Basil seemed perplexed at my manner. ' Miss
Leigh is right,' he said anxiously ; ' and you are
very tired. I can feel that you are trembling
all over. Why did you let me talk so long ? it
must be nearly nine o'clock. Look how bright
the moonlight is ! indeed I cannot allow you to
sit any longer.'

He spoke with such gentle insistence that I
could not refuse to rise ; but I still detained him.

I cannot go back yet. Olga will be there,
and I must speak to you alone. If I am tired
I do not know it ; I am thinking of other things.

I have heard it all now. My poor boy, how you
have suffered ! And then your wife ! It is all so
sad  and to know it is for life.'

Yes, it is for life he answered gloomily.

Oh, my dear, do not speak in that tone '
You have great troubles ; but there may be consolations.'


You are very good to try and comfort me,'
he replied quietly. ' It is your kind heart and
your sympathy that prompt you to speak of

comfort ; but while Aline lives ' He stopped

abruptly.

Do not let us speak of her  not just yet 
you have your cross ; but there may be blessings
in store for you. Basil, I want to tell you
something, only I am afraid of startling you.
What if I have found out something about
your past life that you do not know yourself 
about your father and '

My father !' he exclaimed before I could
finish my sentence  ' my father, who cared so
little about me that he gave me up to a stranger !'
And then he added bitterly : ' Mr. Fleming is
the only father I ever knew.'

My heart sank when I heard him speak in
that tone ; his mother had forsaken him too !
I trembled as I thought of Virginia. For a
moment I hardly knew what to say, and all the
time he was looking at me so keenly.

Do you mean that you knew my father ?' he
asked presently.

'Yes, I knew him. He made the Hfe of one
very dear to me so wretched that death would
have been a relief ; but he is dead now. We
must not judge those who are gone. But for
your broken-hearted mother '

She Is dead too,' he returned quickly ; ' she
died when I was a baby. Mr. Fleming told
me so.*

Someone had lied to him, then.

Basil, your mother is not dead ! All these
years she has been seeking her son !'

In the clear, white light I saw his face
change ; he started violently.

I do not understand you. Why do you
say such strange things to me ? My mother !
I have no mother ! You are making some
mistake.'

I am making no mistake,' I repeated calmly.
All these weeks you have interested me ; but
to-day I have found out the reason. To-morrow
you must come with me to the cemetery at
St. Croix, and we will stand together at your
father's grave, and I will tell you then about
your mother.'

You must tell me now,' he returned, and
his tone betrayed strong emotion. ' You have
said too much and too little. If you knew my

parents  and something in your manner assures
me that you are speaking the truth  you must
know their name and mine. Who am I, then ?'

I took his hands, and hell them as I answered
him.

'You are Ikisil Lyndhursl !' I said. 'You
are the son of my only sister, the grandson
and heir of my father, Ralph Seton !'

He clutched my hands so tightly that I
winced with the j:)ain. * Good God !' was all
he could say for the* moment. I could see it
was impossible for him to realize it.

'You are my nephew, Hail.'

 Am 1 ?' and then he drew his hands away,
and walked to the end of the point.

1 think his emotion was so great that he
could not speak to me. He stood cpiite still
and motionless for a few minutes, with his arms
folded across his chest and his head bent. Then
he came back to me, and, even in that light. I
could see the excited look in his eyes.

'I want the proofs; you must tell me all
everything! There must be nothing kept back
from me, not one word, if this be true !' and his
chest heaved ; it was difficult for him to restrain
himself to speak calmly.

It is true ; but I cannot tell you all to-night.
I am growing weary  I must confess it now 
the strain has been too great. Basil, it is a

great thing that I have told you. I do not
think you have realized it  that you are your
grandfather's heir, and the master of Brookfield
Hall'

You said something Hke that before,' he
returned uneasily. ' No, I do not realize it ; I
feel as though I were dreaming, Miss Seton.'

You must call me Aunt Catherine. Basil,
my dear, you are one of us  you are my boy
now.'

Then he broke down utterly.

Oh,' he said, when he had recovered himself
a little, and we were walking slowly up the
common, ' it is the thought that I have someone
belonorinof to me that unmans me so. To
think that it is you  you who have saved my
boy's life  who now claim me as a nephew; that
I have a mother who has been thinking of me
all these years  it is too much ! too much !'

And your home, Basil  the beautiful home
you have never seen ?'

I cannot take it in to-night,' he returned ina
bewildered tone. ' It is your house, is it not.
Aunt Catherine ?'

He hesitated shyly over the last words ; but
I felt such a thrill of pride as I heard him
say it.

No ; it is yours,' I answered quietly; 'but
your grandfather stipulated that it should be

your mother's home for Hfe, and mine, If we
wished it. But it is a great house, Basil !
There is one wing that has always gone by the
name of the Dower House.'

What do you mean ?' he returned quickly.
Is it possible that you think ?  but I will not
discuss that to-night. Why do you hint at such
things when my brain is almost reeling ? You
do not know what it is to me to feel that there
is such a home for Reggie in the future ; that
the shop at Holloway will be a nightmare of
the past ! Do you mean '  and here his voice
shook again  'that that is all over for ever,
and that 1 am not to go home night after night
to see George smoking in his shirt-sleeves ? Oh,
good heavens ! when I think of my life there !
And you talk to me as though I were going to
turn you out of your home ; and I am to believe
you, and not think it is all a dream !'

He was so agitated that I had some trouble
to quiet him. He complained at last that I
told him so little about his mother. I had
some difficulty in evading his questions.

It is so late, and I am tired out, Basil. Tomorrow
we will have a long talk. If I began
about Virginia, I should not end until midnight ;
but I will tell you as much as this  she is a
great invalid. All her youth and strength has
been crushed out of her ; her life has been

an unhappy one ; her troubles have affected
her nerves ; she is old and weak, and needs
a son's tenderness.'

She shall have it he answered ; and I could
see his eyes were glistening, and then neither
of us said more until we reached La Maison-mette.


He seemed as though he meant to leave me
  perhaps he thought I was too weary ; but
I drew him in.

I cannot part with you just yet, and you
have not tasted food for hours, and Olga will
be waiting to congratulate you.'

But he did not require pressing.

I wanted to come in,' he said simply. * I
felt as though I must see Reggie. Ah ! there
is Miss Leigh ; she has been watching for
us.'

Olga was standing outside the glass door of
the salle-manger. She looked at us anxiously
as we entered.

Well, Aunt Catherine ?' was all she said.

I was about to answer to explain, when Basil
put me aside quite unceremoniously.

'Miss Leigh,' he said eagerly, 'she is my
Aunt Catherine now.'

Yes, I know ;' and Olga held out her hand
to him with one of her sweetest smiles. ' You
are Basil  the long-lost Basil ; for whom they

have been seeking all these years. Oh, I am
so glad. And you and Reggie  dear little
Reggie !  will come to live at the Hall.'

I think those few simple words, said so
cordially, did more to convince Basil of the
truth than all my explanations. The bewildered
look left his face ; he grew calmer. As he
grasped her hand, he said quickly :

You live at Brookfield, too ?'

Yes ; I am so glad. And you will know
Jem, and Hubert, and Kitty; and the children
will play with Reggie. Fancy Reggie and
Girlie-ga together. Aunt Catherine! Oh, it is
too delightful !'

I wondered what made Basil turn his back
suddenly and walk to the window. A minute
afterwards he said he would go up to Reggie.
Olga came and knelt down beside me directly
we were left alone.

Are you very glad, dear Aunt Catherine ?'
she asked gently. I think my answer must
have satisfied her. ' And Basil  I suppose I
must call him Mr. Lyndhurst now  he looks
very pale.'

'It is with happiness. Oh, what a life he
has had, poor boy ! Olga, I must tell you
all about it some day. His wife '

What of his wife ?' she asked quickly.

That is what I cannot tell you now. But

she is unworthy of him ; and she makes him
very unhappy.'

There is all the more need for his mother to
comfort him. I always knew he was unhappy
that is why I was so sorry for him. And he
is poor, too ; and I suppose his home is uncongenial
to him. Poor Mr. Lyndhurst ! But he
will have you, Aunt Catherine. Oh, how proud
he looked when he called you that !'

We talked a little more, for it was some time
before Basil returned, and then we sat down to
supper. I think Olga was the only one who
spoke much. She was gay, vivacious, charming
; our silence did not subdue her in the
least. She insisted on giving Basil a full
description of the Hall. I am sure she did
it on purpose, because she saw how strongly
he was moved. She talked about the Lady's
Walk, and related the Lady Gwendoline's
story. She even mentioned the peacocks,
which she said would be such a delight to
Reggie.

Reggie will have the old nursery, will he not,
Aunt Catherine T she said presently. * It is
papered so prettily, and has such a lovely
view.'

Once she called him Mr. Lyndhurst, and
I saw Basil start and flush.

I do not know my new name yet,' he said,

trying to laugh. ' I think I prefer Basil at
present.'

Mr. Basil, then,' she said, smiling at him.
Your grandfather's name was Ralph ; but he
was not a bit like Ralph of the Iron-hand.
Aunt Catherine, you ought to have been called
Gwendoline ; but, indeed, it would have suited
Mrs. Lyndhurst best.'

Do you mean my mother ' he asked, ina
low voice.

Yes, but her name is Virginia. How
strange that her husband was Paul !' and so
she talked on.

Basil seemed to listen in a sort of trance.
Now and then he put in a word, a suggestion,
a question. As for me, I could not eat ; I sat
with my hands on my lap, thinking of Virginia
and looking at her boy and mine. It was late
before Basil went away ; I wanted him to stay,
but he said for this one night he would rather
go back to the pavilion. He was too restless to
sleep ; he wanted to prowl about, to smoke in the
moonlight. No house could hold him in such
a mood, so I was obliged to let him go.

But I may come in to breakfast, may I not ?*
he said, as he bade me good night ; ' and afterwards
we will have that talk ;' and then Olga
and I stood at the door and watched him
striding down the path to the little gate.

Aunt Catherine, what will Jem say ?' was
Olga's last question that night.

I was worn out, but I could not sleep until
daylight ; the thought of the letter I had to
write to Virginia, and of my impending talk
with Basil, drove all drowsiness from my eyes.
How was I to make him understand Virginia's
timid and morbid nature ? Would he believe
in the mother who, in her nervous panic, had
abandoned her child ? I felt I had not yet
surmounted all my difficulties ; another thought
kept me restless. Would it not be necessary to
see Robert Fleming ? Did we not owe him a
full explanation ? Besides which, a verification
of facts on his side would be satisfactory to us
both. He must know the whole truth about
his adopted son ; he must receive our thanks
for those years of care and tenderness. And
as I remembered them, I felt that Basil, as the.
adopted son of Robert Fleming, was dearer tome
than ever.

Yes, it was this last thought  why should I
deny it ?  that kept me wakeful. One day before
long Robert Fleming and I would meet again
once more in this life, thank God ! I should
look in his true face again ; we who had once
been lovers would grasp hands as friends. I dismissed
these agitating reflections at last, and
again the thought of Basil's dark face glowing

with happiness stole across my mind  my boy
as well as Virginia's ! Our lonely days were
over now. It was no stranger whom I should
present to her, but one whom I already loved,
whom I was beginning to understand. ' He is
already one of us,' I said to myself, as the
happy tears came to my eyes in the darkness ;
and as I remembered Reggie, my cup seemed
full to overflowing.

I dressed myself early the next morning, and
waited for Basil ; I was impatient to see him
again. When I heard the click of the little
gate I went out in the sunshine to meet him.
I had expected a joyous greeting. To my
surprise, his face had the same white shaken
look It had worn when I first spoke to him ;
there was a haoardness about him, as though
he had not slept. As I took his hand, it felt
.weak and nerveless as a little child's.

Basil, my dear boy, are you ill ?'

No,' he returned in a low, vehement voice
that increased my apprehension ; ' but I have
been thinking about it all night, and I am
convinced it must be a mistake. You have
told me nothing  there has been no proof, no
certainty ; It is this that tortures me  that I
cannot bear. If It should be all a mistake !'

It is no mistake, Basil, I am sure  quite
sure  or I would not have told you. In an

hour or two you shall hear everything. Will
you not trust me until then ?'

My quiet voice seemed to soothe him ; he
spoke more calmly.

I thought the night would never end. I
felt as though I could not wait until morning.
If it should not be true, and I must go
back to that life, how could I endure it ?
Would not everything be worse  more unbearable
? In the moonlight I was picturing
it all as Miss Leigh described it. I seemed to
see it in a dream  the old Hall, the Ghost
Walk, the avenue, and the rooks cawing overhead.
I could fancy Reggie running over the
lawns  just fancy the little chap I carried in
my old rug down Highgate Hill !  and then I
thought of my mother  and if it should not be
true !' and he set his teeth hard.

 Basil,' I said gently, * it is true. You are
distressing yourself to no purpose ; it is just a
nervous fancy because you have not slept. I
want you to do something for me  I want you
to come in now and take your breakfast quietly.
I do not wish Olga to see the state you are in ;
it would trouble her so much. I have ordered
Jules to be round at ten o'clock, and we will drive
down to the cemetery ; and when we have
found your father's grave I will tell you all I
know.'

VOL. II. ' 31

I am sure my calmness gave him courage,
for he made a strong effort to carry out my
wishes ; and though he could not eat, and spoke
very little, Olga did not seem to perceive there
was anything amiss. It did us both good to
see her sitting there and looking so cheerful
and serene ; a sort of halo of youth and purity
seemed to surround her ; her large, clear eyes
were beaming with kindliness.

Mr. Basil,' she said in her simple direct
way, * I am sure Reggie is almost well now ; he
has been laughing and talking this morning, and
he wants to be dressed immediately and to go
down to the bay ; for he says all the little fishes
miss him.'

We tried to laugh at this little speech, butin
spite of all Olga's efforts the conversation
Ragged. I was glad when the meal was over,
and Basil went up to his boy. He did not comedown
until the fiacre was at the gate. The
drive was taken almost in silence, and it seemed
long before we reached the cemetery.

Pere Lefevre had given me implicit directions.
Before many minutes had passed 1 conducted
Basil to the spot. There was a little
mound, with a black wooden cross at the head ;
some kind soul had hung a wreath of yellow
immortelles on it. There was the name ' Paul
Lyndhurst,' and ' R.I.P.'  that was all. Basil

had become very quiet ; he took my hand and
led me to a little bench placed in a shady
corner ; no one was in the cemetery ; we had it
to ourselves.

Will you begin from the beginning ?' he said
gravely ; and then, leaning his elbows on his
knees, he composed himself to listen.

It was a long story, but I managed to tell
him everything ; he only interrupted me once.

I will see Monsieur Lefevre myself  that
will be best ; the entry of my baptism must be
found at St. Sulpice.'

This was all he said from the beginning to
the end.

My voice faltered a little when I first spoke
of Virginia, but I suppressed nothing : he was
a full-grown man ; he must know the whole
truth. I disguised nothing  her panic, her
wild flight, her anguished repentance. I tried
to make him see it with my eyes ; I drew a
touching picture of her loneliness, her broken
health, her wanderings in the Lady's Walk, her
nightly prayers for her son.

Basil, she lives for you,' I finished ; * she
has no other thought in life. But for this hope
of finding you her frail existence must have
ended long ago ; it is for you to make up to her
for these years of unutterable sorrow.'

He did not seem as though he heard me ;

312

his head was still buried in his hands ; he did
not move until my voice died away into silence
I had nothing more to say ; then he started
up and stretched his arms over his head.

It is true, then ? Oh, Aunt Catherine !' and
then he took my hand and kissed it.

His face was very grave  almost stern ;
but I saw by his eyes that he doubted no
longer.

You acknowledge that you are Basil Lynd-
hurst, and the grandson of Ralph Seton.'

Yes ; I am not such a fool as to disbelieve
it any longer. I will see Monsieur Lefevre.
Oh, if we could only find Lizette ! and then I
must write to Mr. Fleming. Aunt Catherine,
he must be the first to hear  he comes before
my mother.'

He spoke the last word in a hesitating way ;
his manner did not please me.

Oh, Basil ! not before your mother.'

Yes,' he said, and a dark flush crossed his
face  a flush of extreme pain ; ' you must not
think me hard if I say so ; I have a strange
nature ; I shall find it difficult to forget what
you have told me.* I was silent ; how was I to
answer him ? The next minute I saw him look
at me with great affection. ' Oh, if you were
my mother !' he murmured, and his eyes were
full of tears.

Dear Basil, when you see her you will love
her too.'

I hope so,' but there was no conviction in
his tone. ' Last night I was thinking of her  
oh, so tenderly! I kept saying 'mother" to
myself, just to hear how it sounded ; but the
feeling has got chilled somehow.'

It will pass ; believe me, it will pass ; your
mother is a good woman.'

She was very weak,' he replied gravely.
Look here. Aunt Catherine, I have a little
chap of my own ; I can put myself in her place :
could I ever have left Reggie ?'

You are a man  you have a mean's strength ;
Virginia was a weak girl.'

Miss Leigh is a girl, too. Do you

think But what am I saying ? There

are not many like her.'

Perhaps not ; she is very good. But, Basil,
she is fond of your mother.'

Is she ?' and his face lighted up. ' But,
then, she likes everyone  that is just her goodness.
Aunt Catherine, please do not look so
sad ; of course I mean to be good to my
mother ; do you think I shall reproach her ?
Only when I think of Reggie, and then of that
poor little lonely chap in the garret, I somehow
feel as though an impassable gulf separated me
from my mother.'

His face had settled into sternness again ;
but how was I to reason with him ?

And there is Aline,' he continued after
another silence ; ' what will my mother say to
her?'

She will be sorry, of course ; but she will
receive her kindly and make the best of her.'

I doubt if it will answer,' he returned
gloomily ; ' I cannot imagine Aline at the Hall.
She will disturb your peace and my mother's ;
she is a strange being. She will not assimilate
herself to your ways ; perhaps if I go away '

Go away, and you are the master, Basil !
Do you know it all belongs to you ? All these
years I have been nursing the estate, and
saying to myself, "It is for Basil," and you
would leave us to our loneliness !'

I do not wish to leave you,' he replied
tenderly ; ' it is of you I am thinking, not myself.
I cannot bear to think that my wife may
bring trouble !'

We cannot help all that,' I answered
quickly ; ' it is her right. We cannot rob her
of her prerogative. Where you and the child
are, Aline must be !'

I suppose so,' he replied in a troubled tone ;
 but she would be happier with George.'

The house is large enough for all,' was my
answer. ' Do you remember what 1 told you

last night, Basil ? There is a wing that has
always been used as a dower-house. There is
plenty of room there for Virginia and me. We
shall not be in Aline's way or yours.'

He made no reply ; but after a minute he
rose and began to pace the walks. Presently
he came back to me, his eyes kindling, his head
held high. 1 saw then, for the first time, a likeness
to his mother when she was a girl.

Basil,' I said eagerly, ' you have the Seton
mouth. You remind me of your mother and
grandfather !'

He looked excessively pleased at that.

I am trying to realize it all,' he said simply ;
yesterday I was no one ; I did not even know
my own name ; I was indebted to charity for a
roof; to-day'  here his eyes flashed ; he looked
wonderfully handsome  ' to-day I am Basil
Lyndhurst, master of Brookfield Hall ; the
descendant of a hundred brave ancestors 
among them, Ralph of the Iron-hand; and the
best of it all is,' his voice changing as he spoke,
'that it will all come to my little chap  to
Reggie !'

Lisette DUPONT.

Let our old acquaintance be renewed.'

Second Part of ' Henry IV:

she's a good creature.'

Me?'7y Wh'cs of Windsor

It was nearly one o'clock when we parted at the
gate of the cemetery, for Basil had excused
himself from accompanying me back to La
Maisonnette. He would put me into a passing
fiacre, he said ; but there were many things that
would detain him at St. Genette. It was absolutely
necessary for him to seek an interview
with Pere Lefevre. He wished to see an entry
of his baptism at St. Sulpice. Inquiries must
also be set on foot for the relatives of Lizette
Dupont ; he must take counsel with Pere
Lefevre on the matter. All this was said in a
quick, decisive voice. Basil was bringing his
clear, masculine intellect to bear on the subject.

I felt he would lose no time and spare no pains
in unravelling every possible clue. To my
surprise, he begged me to defer my letter to
Virginia until the next day.

It will be a long letter ; it will take you
hours to write it,' he continued as I remonstrated
with him. ' You are far too tired for such
a task, and I am sure Miss Leigh will agree
with me. You must go home and rest, that
you may be ready to talk to me this evening ;'
but I objected to this on the score of selfishness.

You selfish !' he returned in atone of infinite
scorn ; but he relented at my pleading face.
Well, if you must write, let it be a brief note
of preparation ; it will be better so. Say you
have news  important news ; that you know
exactly where Basil is to be found ; that he is
well, and that you will write more fully by the
next mail. Will you promise me to do this,
Aunt Catherine ?' and he would not let me leave
him until I had promised.

How strange it was to submit to that strong
young will ! Since my father's death no one had
contested mine, and yet it was sweet to me to
give way. ' There is someone to take care of us
now,' I thought, as I drove away and left him
standing in the middle of the road. He had
pulled off his gray cap, and the sunshine shone
on his uncovered head. How strong he looked

SO full of life and energy, with such free grace
and ease in every movement  a son of whom
any mother could be proud ! And as I thought
of Virginia, I could not see him for the mist
before my eyes.

The mid-day meal was over when I arrived.
I had left orders that things should go on
as usual ; but Jeanne brought me a dainty
little dinner, and waited on me. Olga was
with Reggie in the little grove. I could seethe
red umbrella orleaminiif through the trees.
As soon as I had refreshed myself, and written
a few lines to Virginia, I joined them, after
giving orders that our coffee should be served
there. I was too much excited to sleep, and
an easy-chair in the shade would be delicious.
Reggie was lying in the hammock, and looked
far more like his old self, in spite of the loss of
his hair. I thought he was prettier than ever.
His delicacy gave him an ethereal look, and his
eyes were larger and brighter. He had his
two kittens hugged tightly in his arms. I
thought I never saw a sweeter picture.

Olga was reading. She put down her book
to talk to me. I told her a little about our
morning's conversation, but it was not possible
to say much before Reggie, and after a time
we changed the subject. Presently she leant
towards me and whispered : ' Do you know,

Reggie has been talking about his mother today
quite of his own accord. When I asked
him if he wanted to go back to her, he shook
his head most decidedly.

" Reggie will stop here with father and my
Dear," he said. '' Mother is always too tired to
put Reggie to bed, so Becky comes ;" and then
he went on about Uncle George, but I could
not understand him in the least. ''If Reggie
goes home, my Dear must come too," he finished.
Was it not pretty of him to say that ?'

Olga, I do believe you love that child more
than you love Girlie-ga or Wilfred.'

I cannot help it,' she returned quickly. ' Is
it wrong, Aunt Catherine ? one is not responsible
for these things. I dare say Mr. Fleming
felt the same for that little child he found in
the garret. I think Reggie and I will always
love each other, if it were only for the memory
of the sweet days we have passed together.'

She spoke in a somewhat troubled tone.
Olga certainly looked a little pale and subdued
this afternoon ; perhaps the heat oppressed her ;
she had lost her old vivacity ; but the next
minute she made an effort to recover herself.

 Oh, do you know there is something I have
not told you ? I had a letter from Jem this
morning, such a long delightful letter, and he
says that next week he will be coming home,

and he wants to know if there will be any chance

of seeing me.'

That depends on Basil. Reggie is well
enough to travel now. Next week ?  oh yes !
Virginia will be expecting us before that.'

Will it be so soon over  our happy visit ?'
And Olga looked wistful, almost sad. ' It
will be like a dream when we look back on it
the bay, and the yellow sands, and Seton
Point, and this dear old house, and the pavilion.
Shall you care to see Jem again, Aunt Catherine ?
But he is nothing now ; it is only Mr. Basil.'

She spoke with the smile still on her lips.
Olga had such a lovely smile, but only I who
knew her could recognise the sadness underneath
it.

Yes, it is Basil who is our own boy ; but you
will still be a part of my life  you and Jem.
Even Basil will not come between us. Surely
you believe this, Olga ?'

Oh )'es/ she returned, kissing me hastily.
Dear Aunt Catherine, do you think I would
have it otherwise ? All these years you have
been so patient and so lonely, and now you
have Mr. Basil and Reggie ; for Reggie is
your own, too. How glad Jem will be ! but
you must expect him to be surprised ; and it
will be nice, too, for me when I come up to the
Hall, for there will be Reggie to play with, and

sometimes for a great treat his grandmother
will let me carry him off to Fircroft, and we
will show him the Surprise ; and perhaps Hugh
will let him have a little garden of his own, and
I shall sit and watch him with the other children,
and Kitty will be as fond of him as
possible.'

We had both forgotten Reggie's mother.
What would Olga say when she knew the sort
of woman Basil would bring to the Hall as its
mistress? Would not her pure nature be shocked
by such a contrast ? would not even Basil
sink in her estimation when she had seen his
wife ? I was about to answer her, when Jeanne
appeared with the coffee ; and the next moment
Basil's tall figure blocked up the doorway.
Reggie caught sight of him and shouted
his name with all his feeble force ; then he
raised himself up in the hammock and stretched
out his arms. It was hardly a wonder that
Basil snatched him up and kissed him before
he had a word for us. ' Has Reofme wanted
father so badly ?' he asked with that wonderful
gentleness he always showed to his boy.

Reggie always wants father,' returned the
little fellow in his quaint way  ' father and my
Dear.'

I saw Basil look hastily across at Olga ; but
she was busying herself with the coffee-cups

and did not seem to see him. I wondered if he
noticed her paleness. She had put on her white
gown to please me. I always grumbled if Olga
did not wear white in the summer ; nothing
suited her so well. This afternoon she had
fastened a spray of jasmine at her throat ; she
looked so young, so child-like and simple, that
it did one good to see her. I wondered why
Basil suddenly knit his brows together as
though something pained him ; then he put
Reggie back in the hammock again and turned
to me.

Aunt Catherine, I have seen the entry of
my baptism at St. Sulpice. Pere Lefevre 
what an old brick he is !  went with me. There
it was  Basil Theodore Lyndhurst. The priest
who baptized me is dead now ; his name was
Pere Delays.'

I am so glad you have seen it for yourself.'

Glad that I am a Roman Catholic ?' with an
amused glance at me. * You will be sorry to
hear, then, that I was re-baptized at Leeds ; but
I have found out more than that. Miss Leigh,
do you think Aunt Catherine is too tired to
drive with me again to St. Croix ? it is a
beautiful evening, and I have a fiacre at the
door, and when we have finished our coffee *

Oh, Basil, do you mean '

That we have found Lizette Dupont ? That

is exactly what I do mean. That old trump 
I beg his pardon  Pere Lefevre had discovered
her ; she is still alive, you see, and as brisk and
sensible at seventy-five as she was at fifty ; she
told his reverence that she was not much over
fifty when she became my bonne.'

Have you seen her, Basil ?'

No,' he replied, laughing. ' I could not
accomplish everything in three hours and a half.
I was more than two hours with Monsieur
Lefevre, and he gave me something to eat ; then
we went to St. Sulpice and spent another hour,
and here I am.'

And you want me to go with you ?'

Yes ; but not until you have finished your
coffee ; there is no hurry ; it is only five now.
Miss Leigh. I am afraid you will owe me a
grudge for carrying off Aunt Catherine; but
you can understand how anxious I am to establish
my own identity.'

Yes,' she said gently, ' I can understand
that, Mr. Basil, and I will go and fetch Aunt
Catherine's bonnet and her lace shawl  for there
is no need for her to fatigue herself unnecessarily
; and then I will put Reggie to bed, for I
can see he is growing tired.'

She moved away as she spoke, and I could
see Basil was watching her closely ; when she
had disappeared into the house, he said :

Aunt Catherine, you have known Miss
Leigh for years  since she was a little girl ;
does she ever think of herself at all ?' and
without waiting for my answer he continued :
But I am going to carry Reggie in myself, for
he is growing quite heavy. Do you think you
can sit on my shoulder again, old fellow ?' and
as Reggie screamed with delight at the idea, he
was carried off in the old fashion.

Basil had secured a pair of fresh horses,
and in a very short time w c were rattling down
the steep stony roads that led to St. Sulpice.
By-and-by we had to descend, and enter a sort
of blind alley. The houses looked poor and
squalid ; but one at the end had a more
respectable appearance. The step before the
door had been freshly scoured ; some plants
blocked up the little window. A young woman
with a baby in her arms was talking volubly
to a man in a blue blouse. Basil walked upto
her with his cap in his hand.

Madame, it is here that Lizette Dupont
lives ?'

Mais oui, vraiment ; monsieur was perfectly
correct. She was Lizette Dupont's granddaughter,
and this was Gustave, her husband.
Le bon pere had already enlightened them ; they
were to expect une dame Anglaise, who had les
affaires with the grandsire ; would madame

and monsieur enter ? The place was dark ; but
they would become accustomed to the obscurity.
And she was discoursing still volubly when a
shrill voice from within was heard chiding her
for her delay.

Tiens ! thou hast been a chatterton from
thy birth, Marie! Let madame enter;' and
then Marie withdrew her substantial figure
from the doorway.

Be not cross, little mother,' she said tranquilly
; ' the day is long enough and to spare.
Entrez, madame !' and I advanced cautiously
into the close, dark room.

When my eyes became used to the dim light
I could see Lizette Dupont more distinctly; she
was sitting knitting by the stove. She was a
tiny woman, with a brown, puckered face and
bead-like black eyes that looked sharply at us.
She wore a close cap, rather like her great-grandchild's,
and a pair of silver ear-rings
dangled against her wrinkled neck.

She greeted us with shrill welcomes, and
begged to know our errand. Le bon pere
had been mysterious. ' Une dame Anglaise
wishes to question you, my daughter ; there are
les affaires.' That was all that had been said;
and then he had asked her many questions
about her past life.

I commenced cautiously ; but directly Basil's

VOL. II. 2

name had crossed my lips she interrupted me
with a loud exclamation :

Le petit ange ! le pauvre cher enfant ! was
it of him madame would speak ? But, truly,
le bon Dieu was wonderful in His ways!
It might be her prayers to our blessed Lady
had touched her Son's sacred heart. She had
prayed, she had wept, that she might have
news of the little one before she died.

She was so excited that I hardly knew how
to proceed ; but Basil came to my assistance.
He took her shrivelled hand, and said gently :

That was a long time ago, Lizette. Should
you know me now ?'

You, monsieur, you !' and the little beady-black
eyes seemed to look him through and
through. ' Holy Virgin ! could this grand-looking
monsieur, so much stronger and bigger
than her Pierre  could he be her baby, her
nursling, her petit Basil ?'

'Yes, truly, ma bonne  I am Basil Lynd-
hurst.'

Lyndhurst ! oh, the name !' she screamed,
and the skinny arms were flung round his
neck, and, before he could remonstrate, she
had kissed him on either cheek.

He bore it very well, however ; indeed, he
told me afterwards that those kisses of his old
nurse had touched him greatly.

She is only a peasant ; but once she was the
only friend I had. Can I ever forget that ?'

The poor old creature was so much overcome
that it was some time before we could
induce her to compose herself. The tears
rolled down her wrinkled face, and she kept
ejaculating, in a sort of ecstasy, ' Le cher petit !
le joli ange !' stroking Basil's hand all the time.

He coaxed her at last to recount her little
story. She wandered a good deal at first, and
we found it difficult to follow her meaning,
though she spoke very tolerable French. She
would clench her fist whenever she mentioned
Paul Lyndhurst's name  ' cet homme infamy !'
as she called him  but we understood her better
after a little.

I adored my mistress,' she said presently ;
she was so gentle and so handsome, and until
that bad man broke her heart and drove her
away she lived only for her child.'

'Hush, Lizette ; you are speaking of Basil's
father.'

But Basil gave me a reproving glance.

Do not interrupt her, Aunt Catherine ; it is
better to hear the truth. It is not possible forme
to respect my father's memory ; I have told
you already that Mr. Fleming is the only father
I have ever known.'

Fleming ! Tiens, mon enfant ! that was the

2  2

name of the English priest who carried thee
away ! Holy Mother ! how it all comes back
to me ! and yet it was nearly four-and-twenty
years ago.'

We exchanged looks of mutual satisfaction,
and she rambled on :

My mistress was so devoted to the child
that she could not bear him out of her sight.
He is my only consolation," she would say.
Look at him, Lizette !" she would cry ; " is he
not a wonderful baby } and so intelligent ! See,
he is holding my finger now !" and so on ; for
she would talk of him for hours. It was a
happy day for me when Pere Delays baptized
him in our beautiful church. We carried him
there secretly, for fear of monsieur. The
English priest was absent, and madame was
in great perplexity what to do.

" My child must be baptized," she said.
If I cannot find a Protestant clergyman, I
will take him to St. Sulpice. There is no time to
be lost ; Paul will carry us off in a day or two."

Seest thou, mon enfant, how the blessed
Virgin heard my prayers ?' and her shrill voice
softened into tenderness.

Alas ! the very day after our little one received
the grace of baptism there was the
terrible scene with monsieur, and madame fled
from the house. We waited up for her all

night ; monsieur's rage was awful. When she
did not come back, and a week had passed, he
carried us off. I was afraid to go, to trust myself
with cet homme terrible ; but there was the
little one, so I went.

It was a miserable life we led, wandering
from town to town wherever there were picture-galleries;
for monsieur cared for nothing but his
pictures and the drink.

He fell ill at last, and they removed him to a
hospital. He was raving mad, they told me.
What a position ! picture it for thyself, mon
cher. No money  hardly a sou to buy us
bread ; but the blessed saints were not deaf to
Lizette's prayer. The woman of the house was
a good Christian ; she had children of her own;
she pitied us.

'there is the garret," she said; "it will
shelter thee and the child. When meal-time
comes I will spare thee some onion broth and
some bread. Do not lose faith. When monsieur
is well, he will repay me."

Oh, she was a good creature, this Madame
Other!

We lived like this for weeks ; le petit grew
and thrived. When people saw him in the
public walks, they said he was as beautiful as
an angel. Many came up and spoke to him,
and pressed bon-bons and cakes on him. Then

he would run to me and show me his treasures.


'' Regarde-tu, ma bonne, these bon-bons
Basil has got !"

Then they would look at me curiously.

'' He is poorly dressed ; but that peasant is
not his mother," they would say.

One day the English priest came up and
spoke to him, and the next day to that ; and afterward
le petit would clap his hands at the sight
of him. Recalled him the kind Englishman.

One wet day we were in our garret. Le
petit had no toys, and he was playing with a bit
of wood and some rags. I was in bad spirits.
Madame Gotier had been up, and told me that
her husband had been grumbling at her.

'' We have not enough for our own children,
and thou art feeding strangers," he had said.

And then she caught up the child and cried,
and we both wept together.

" Lizette, thou must speak to the Maire,"
she said presently. " I dare not anger Henri ;
he is, as thou knowest, of a violent temper."

I prayed to our Mother of Sorrows with all
my heart when she had left me. Le petit
seemed uneasy at my tears.

" Why dost thou weep, ma bonne ?' he
asked, stroking my face; "they will give us
bread to-day."

" And tomorrow, men enfant ?"
*' To - morrow  we shall see ;" and he
marched off with a wise look.

What did le pauvre petit know of tomorrow
? Alas ! my tears could not cease.
Must I take the child in my arms, and beg
my way back to St. Croix ? Should we not
both expire with fatigue and famine ?

Mon enfant ! my faith had failed ; and at
that moment relief was at hand. There was
a knock at the door, and the English priest
came in. Le petit shouted at the sight of
him.

" Hast thou brought Basil some pain-device,
monsieur ?" he cried ; and when the
Englishman took him in his arms, he patted
his face with his little hands.

" Are you in trouble, my good woman ?"
he asked presently, sitting down beside me,
while the child opened his box of bon-bons ; and
then it all came out  what Madame Gotier had
told me, and how her husband had refused us
shelter.

'' I will settle all that," he said quietly.
'will you come with me, Basil? I will bring
you back to your nurse presently ;" and actually
le petit left his bon-bons at once.

" May I take some pain-device to Consonant
Marie?" he asked.

Ah ! it was like the dear angel, to share
with others.

From that day all went well. Monsieur
Flemings he told me that was his name  came
to us every day. Sometimes he took us outwith
him. Henri ceased to grumble, for rent
was paid for the garret, and Madame Gotier
served our meals regularly. It was not always
onion soup now, but sometimes roast meat and
vegetables ; and plenty of milk and white
bread for breakfast and supper.

'* Monsieur pays for everything," Madame
Gotier told me one evening. * Henri is in
an excellent temper ; everything is as it should
be."

I was happy then ; I think I loved le petit
more than my own children ; I wanted those
days to go on lor ever ; too soon they came
to an end !

One day I was summoned to the hospital.
Monsieur Lyndhurst informed me abruptly that
he had no further need of my services. My
wages would be paid, and I might go to my
own people. He had made other arrangements
for Basil. The English clergyman
would take him to England  this was all he
told me. Was it a wonder that I believed
in my own heart that he was taking him to his
mother?

I was heart-broken ; but it was for the
child's good. I was only an ignorant peasant,
who could neither read nor write ; and he was
like a young prince for beauty. I let him go ;
I think I did not speak ; something seemed to
choke the words back. Le petit kissed me,
and went off gaily, chattering to his new friend.

As for me,' finished Lizette sadly, ' I went
to live with Pierre, until he married again, and
then Julie's daughter took me in. There were
little ones in both houses ; but they were not
le petit. For years I never ceased to regret
him ; but I became comforted at last.'

Lizette,' I interrupted in a tremulous voice
that I strove in vain to steady, ' you have not
described this English clergyman who took
Basil away.'

I am not good at description, madame,' she
returned simply. ' Monsieur was young, but he
looked worn and sad ; someone told me he had
had an illness. He was not handsome  not
like Monsieur Lyndhurst, who had la beauty
de Diable  but his face inspired one with
confidence. He had gray eyes, full of gentleness,
and when he smiled it seemed to lift the
weight off one's heart. For the rest, his face
was smooth like a boy's, and his hair was a
reddish brown ; he used to rumple it when he
grew excited in his talk, and he would get up

from his chair and walk up and down the room,
talking all the time.'

I never could break him of the habit,'
observed Basil, laughing ; ' and that trick of
running his fingers through his hair when he
was perplexed  how well I remember it !
Aunt Catherine, is it this close room that
makes you look so pale ? I shall be glad to
get out in the air myself.'

Let us go,' I returned quickly.

Oh, how true it all was ! I felt as Lizette
talked as though Robert Fleming were standing
beside me ; that infinitely sweet smile, those
deep-set gray eyes  had I ever forgotten them ?

Must thou go, mon enfant ?' exclaimed
Lizette querulously. ' I have found thee only
to see thee vanish again.'

I will come again before we leave St. Croix,'
he replied soothingly. * If I can, I will bring
my boy Reggie ; he will remind you of the
little Basil. I will tell you about him another
time, but 1 must go now.'

He pressed some money into her hand, and
shook it heartily. Marie was still talking to
her husband ; she eyed us curiously as we
passed. The fiacre was waiting at the end of
the alley, and we were soon rattling through the
stony streets. Basil appeared lost in thought
for some time ; then he roused himself.

Aunt Catherine,' he said quietly, ' tomorrow
I shall write to Mr. Fleming and tell him
everything, and you must write to my
mother.'

Would it not be better to speak to him,
Basil ?  there is so much to explain.'

 Of course I must speak to him. If I were
in England, I would go to him at once, Aunt
Catherine,' looking at me wistfully. ' Do you
not think we ought to go as soon as possible ?'

You are right. When she receives my
letter  the letter I am to write tomorrow 
your mother will count the hours until she sees
you. She will not sleep or rest until she has
looked upon her son's face.'

In that case we ought to start at once. It
is Friday  we might take the Monday boat.
Is not this your opinion ?'

I have not thought about it ; I will tell you
tomorrow,' I replied faintly.

I could decide nothing more that night.
Basil was very quick. He saw at once that I
was exhausted, and said no more ; but when I
looked at him I could see by his intent face
that he was making his plans. Of course he
would have his way, and, after all, it was a
comfort not to decide for one's self. * I shall
leave everything to Basil,' was my last
thought before I fell asleep that night.

Good-bye TO LA MAISONNETTE.

I never looked a last adieu

To things familiar, but my heart
Shrank with a feeling, almost pain,
Even from their lifelessness to part.'

Miss Bowles.

After all, Basil had his way, and we arranged
to start by the Monday boat. Olga heard our
decision very quietly. When I said a word or
two of regret about her holiday being over,
she stopped me at once.

That has nothing to do with you and Mr.
Basil,' she said quickly. ' Your business is
finished ; it is right for you to go home. We
have been here seven weeks  seven weeks 
and I think they have been the happiest of my
lite  with a certain wistful emphasis on the
words.

But you are sorry that our visit is over,
Olga ?' I persisted.

One is always sorn when a holiday is over,

but that is not the right way of looking at it.
Your anxiety is over, and you are going to
show rIr. Basil his beautiful home, and I shall
be near you. and you will tell me about everything,
and Jem and I will be as happy as
possible.' But. for all that, there were tears in
her eves when she kissed me. ' Dear Aunt
Catherine, it has been so nice having you to
myself. I shall never forget these days at La
Maisonnette  never '

Here she broke off suddenly, as Basil came
into the room, and went out into the garden to
join Reggie. Basil looked after her rather
anxiously.

Has she been crying ?' he asked abruptly.
Is she sorry to leave here ? I do not wish to
be selfish, Aunt Catherine, and if you think
Miss Leigh '

Olga is quite ready to go,' I returned ; ' she
perfectly approves of our decision. As for
breaking our journey and savior at an hotel
for the night, she approves of that, too. She
thinks, with me, that Reggie will be too tired if
we eo on, and that it will be far better for you
to see your home in daylight.'

I was not thinking of myself when I proposed
it,' he replied, with a shade of annoyance
in his tone. Basil had been slightly irritable

all the morning ; the excitement and strain of
the last few days were telling upon him. ' I
thought a few hours' rest would be good for
you and Reggie, and we should give my mother
a little time to recover herself. If you or
Miss Lehigh think otherwise, I need not engage
the rooms.'

It is far better to do as you have arranged,
Basil, my dear. It is such pleasure to have
someone to take care of us. I have always had
to be the business-man of the family ; but I
shall gladly abdicate in your favour ;' but to my
surprise he made no response to this little speech.

He took up some telegrams and read them,
and then he said in a low voice :

Miss Leigh does not look herself. I want
you to tell her from me that if she wishes it
Reggie shall be with her as much as he is now.
1 am too grateful to her not to spare him whenever
she wants him. It shall be the same at
Brookfield as it is here. Will you tell her this,
Aunt Catherine ?'

Certainly I will if you wish it, Basil.'

His manner gave me a little uneasiness ; he
seemed far from happy, as though Olga's sadness
had infected him ; but after a few minutes
he conquered his unaccountable depression, and
showed me the letter he had written to Mr.
Fleming.

I have sent a telegram, too,' he said presently
; but I was so absorbed with the contents
of the letter that I forgot to ask him, then or
afterwards, what he had said in his telegram.
There was so much to arrange that day 
letters to write and bills to pay, and all sorts
of commissions to give Basil when he went to
the town.

He did not come back until Reggie was
asleep and Olga had joined me in the salon.
He found us sitting at the open window, looking
out on the barn and the moonlit court.

'It is such a delicious evening!' he said
coaxingly ; ' would not you and Miss Leigh like
a stroll on the common before supper ? You
have not been out of the house all day, Aunt
Catherine !'

But you must be so tired, Basil.'

Tired !' with a contemptuous laugh ; ' why,
I could walk ten more miles with ease. Miss
Leigh, I hope you will join us. Monsieur
Perrot has been prophesying rain tomorrow ;
so perhaps it may be our last walk together at
St. Croix.'

Very well,' she replied gently, rising at
once from her seat, and we followed Basil into
the lane.

We strolled past the little grove and down
the common, towards Seton Point ; but he

would not let us pause there, so we went down
the steep path, by the bathing-house, to the
sands below. Just as were passing it Basil
addressed Olga for the first time :

Do you remember that morning when you
called to us to take shelter from the rain ? It
was one of the many kindnesses for which I
have to thank you  one of the things I shall
never forget. I hope you do not think I am
ungrateful [{ I say lite about them.'

I think it is your nature to be grateful, Mr.
Basil,' she answered quietly ; ' but you have
nothing for which to thank me. I have always
pleased myself in what I have done. It is so
pleasant to serve one's friends.'

We are friends, then, Miss Leigh ?'

I thought it rather odd of Basil to make this
speech when Olga had shown him such real
friendship ; but she answered him quite
naturally:

Oh yes ; I hope so. I should be very sorry
to believe otherwise.'

And I, too ;' but he spoke so much under his
breath that I doubted if she heard him. Then
he turned to me and asked me to take his arm.
I was walking so slowly that he was sure I was
tired. He spoke in his old affectionate way.
Perhaps he already knew how I loved to lean
on that strong young arm.

We Stood for a long time looking at the
silvery waves as they shimmered and sparkled
in the moonlight. We were all very silent at
first until Olga began to talk in her gentle,
rapid way.

I shall always like this bay ; but I think I
prefer the wide open sea at St. Genette, where
the big waves roll in and break into white surf
on the shore. It is more real, somehow. Do you
know what I mean ?' half turnings to Basil as
though she were addressing him.

I think I can guess,' he returned ; ' there is
more freedom. It gives one a greater sense of
power. One can imagine what the sea looks
like hundreds of miles away ; but, all the same,
I should have thought this quiet, peaceful bay
would have suited your taste better.'

You think I am tame in my ideas,' she
replied, with a touch of impatience. ' You are
wrong ; you do not know me. This peace, this
tranquillity, might become a little monotonous intime
; it is more suited for age than youth. I
am not quite so prim and quiet as you think. I
am afraid I like change  variety, even storms ;
yes, even storms,' with a little laugh ; ' it is
like life. Things are for ever changing in life 
hopes and fears, joys, disappointments, miseries,
all come tumbling to our feet like the big waves
at St. Genette.'

VOL. II. Z

I think there are no miseries in store for
you,' he answered quickly. 'If I were a
prophet, I should prophesy smooth things of
your future. After all, your life will be like this
bay  there will be no billows mountain high to
engulf your little bark.'

There are storms even in this bay,' she
replied, smiling. ' People have been drowned
Jeanne told me so. Your smooth things
may be deceitful. I do not think you are a
true prophet. Do you know, when I was a
child I wanted to be a martyr ;' and actually
she related to him the childish incident of the
scorched finger. She told it so prettily, too,
with a pathetic rendering that took away all
desire to laugh.

I do not know what Basil thought of it, but
he said :

Poor little thing ! Poor innocent little
child !'  half to himself.

So you see I shall never make a martyr.'

Why not ?' he returned. ' Because you
have failed once ? Do you think perfection
is to be achieved in one attempt ? You must
ask Aunt Catherine's opinion  it is not for me
to talk to you.'

But I wish you to talk to me,' she replied
playfully.

I cannot, Miss Leigh, I have made too

many mistakes in my own life to set people right
with theirs. How can you ask a man who has
trampled on his own ideals, and who has
squandered all his priceless treasures in return
for a passing gratification, to preach faith to
such an one as you ? Mr. Fleming is your sort ;
he would talk to you for hours.'

Mr. Basil,' she said quickly, ' I thought
you said just now that we were friends. Have
you forgotten that already ?'

No; certainly not,' looking at her in some
surprise.

Well, then, I do not like my friends to
paint themselves in such black colours ; it is
not kind to Aunt Catherine, or to yourself.
What does it matter if you have made mistakes,
except that you must bear the consequences
as patiently as you can ? So many
people make mistakes, and are sorry, and then
do better, and '

 But there is one mistake that can never be
rectified he answered in a low voice.

I knew at once that he was thinking of his
wife, but I could not tell if Olga understood
him ; it was not possible for either of them
to speak quite plainly.

If it cannot be rectified, you must just make
the best of it she answered. ' I suppose if we
sow tares of our own free will we cannot

o t o

expect corn to grow up. Is that not
true ?'

Yes, I suppose so,' he replied gloomily ; but
she would not let him finish in that tone.

You must not speak so, as though everything
would not come right some day. Life is
not for ever. You will not take your mistakes
with you up above. Perhaps  who knows ? 
they may be set right here.'

Never  never !' between his clenched teeth.

 Never mind,' she returned cheerfully ; ' then
you must just put up with them as they are. It
will not be so hard when you are in your beautiful
home, and you have your mother and Aunt
Catherine and Reggie. You will have so much
to do ; there will be your tenants, and perhaps
you may enter Parliament ; and when you are
doing good with all your might and helping
other people to be good too, you will not find
much time for thinking of past mistakes. Am
I not right. Aunt Catherine ?'

Yes, my darling ; Basil will find this out for
himself one day.'

What am I to say to you two good women ?'
returned Basil with suppressed emotion. ' I
think I had better say nothing for fear I should
make an ass of myself ; but you shall see you
shall see  if I am not a better man from this
day.'

It will all come right,' she said cheerfully;
and then she walked a little farther to the edge
of the sea, and we heard her singing the verse
of a hymn softly to herself:

Brief life is here our portion ;

Brief sorrow, short-lived care ;
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is there.'

Basil made no remark, and we walked on.
Once we looked back ; Olga was still standing
motionless in the same position. The moonlight
shone on her white dress, and on her
uplifted face. She had thrown a light woollen
scarf over her head. In the strange silvery
light she looked like some beautiful picture.

Do you know of what she reminds me now,
Basil ?'

No,' he answered rather shortly.

Of some picture I have seen of Christiana
about to cross the river. The drapery looks
just the same, and there is the water.'

I thought Christiana was an old woman,' he
answered curtly. ' To my mind. Miss Leigh
rather resembles Mercy or Phoebe.'

Evidently my fancy did not please him, for he
called to her somewhat peremptorily :

It is getting late, Miss Leigh, and i\unt
Catherine is very tired ;' and she ran towards
us at once.

I suppose I must not ask what you were

thinking about just now ?' remarked Basil, as
she joined us.

I was only saying good-bye to it all,' she
returned, looking at him a little sadly. ' It has
been such a lovely time, and this is such a dear
place !' and then she came round to my side
and took my arm, and we went slowly up by
the washing-pool, and under the dark overhanging
trees ; and it seemed to me that
neither of them spoke again until we reached
home, and then Basil said he had a headache,
and did not want his supper.

Olga and I went to church the next morning,
while Basil stopped with Reggie ; and in the
evening Olga took his place. We spent the
afternoon in the garden, and Basil made me
come with him and say good-bee to the
pavilion ; he did not ask Olga to come too.

It is only for you and me,' he whispered.
Do you think I shall ever forget that night.
Aunt Catherine, when I was sick with famine
and could not touch food ; and yet I could take
it from your hand like a child.'

We went to church together after that, leaving
Olga with Reggie. Basil had been a little
quiet and subdued all day, but he became like
his old self directly he found himself alone with
me. In the course of our walk he spoke a
great deal of his mother and Aline.

I want you to tell me what I am to do he
said presently. ' I have been lyino;- awake for
hours thinking of the future. I know what my
duty is to Aline, and yet how am I to do it
without causing misery to you and my mother ?
I want you to advise me and help me.'

My dear,' I replied after a moment's hesitation,
' I am old-fashioned, and have old-fashioned
notions.'

You mean,' he returned quickly, for he always
seemed to understand the slightest hint, ' that
I must act up to the spirit as well as to the
letter of my marriage vows  for better for
worse  and it has been for worse all along.'
A bitter sigh escaped him, and then he went
on : ' I have tried to be a good husband to her
indeed I have tried ; but it is she who has
failed in her wifely duty. Aunt Catherine, I
should never have left her as I have if she had
said a word to keep me ; her sullenness has
driven me away. I believe in my heart that
she is happier without me ; last night I was
thinking that perhaps it would be better for her
to stay with George.'

Basil, my dear boy, would that be right }'

I think it would be the lesser of two evils.

If Aline be at the Hall, she will make your

and my mother's life wretched ; she is safer

with George ; in some way I think I irritate

her. I could make her an allowance, and
Reggie and I could go and see her sometimes !'

I was silent. It would be easier so ; our
poor boy would in some degree recover his lost
freedom. But again I asked myself, Would it
be right ? Could anyone absolve him of the
responsibility he had taken on himself ? 
Those whom God has joined together let no
man put asunder.' As I thought of those
awful words I shuddered.

Basil was watching my face as though to
gain the clue to my thoughts. I repeated the
words aloud ; he seemed to shiver as he heard
them.

Don't, Aunt Catherine !'

My dear, she is your wife ; you are responsible
in God's sight for that poor girl ; she is
the mother of your boy  of your little lost
angel. In spite of her grievous infirmities, she
has been a true wife to you.'

He flushed up at that.

She has never cared for any other man,' he
said proudly.

In her own way she loves you. No, do not
shake your head. I have gathered this from
your own words. You have no right to refuse
her the shelter of your home, unless she tells
you that she wishes to remain with her brother.'

She will never tell me that.'

Are you sure of that, Basil ?'

Quite sure. You do not know Aline ; she
is proud, too, in her way ; she always wanted
to marry a gentleman  to live above her
station ; she likes soft, luxurious living  handsome
clothes  dainty food ; she would like to
drive in her carriage. George cannot gratify her
tastes ; I have only to say '' Come," and she
will leave him at once.'

And yet you think she will be happier with
him ?'

After a time  yes ; these things will only
satisfy her until they have lost their novelty.
She has got the demon of unrest within her ;
neither I nor any living man can make Aline
happy. I am telling you the whole truth ;
when she comes to the Hall, there will be
misery in store for us all.'

It will not be so bad as you think, Basil,' I
returned, anxious to soothe him. ' In a small
house it might be so ; but when you see the
wing we call the Dower House, you will take a
more cheerful view of things. There are two
large sitting-rooms ; there will be no necessity
for us even to have our meals together. Aline
need never see us unless she likes.'

Aunt Catherine,' he remonstrated, ' is it
to me you are saying this ? Do you think I am
so happy that I shall not need you every day of

my life ? Will there be anyone dearer to me
or more honoured than you ?'

Basil  your mother !'

I do not know my mother impatiently ;
she is not my friend as you have been. How
do I know how things will be between us ? It
is you to whom I shall turn for comfort when
Aline '  and then he stopped, and went on
bitterly  ' yes, I will ask her to come ; I will
not shirk my duty. Will that content you ?'

Yes,* I replied, pressing his arm. * I ask
nothing but to see )Ou do your duty. Basil,
when you go and fetch your wife I will go too.'

You !' he exclaimed, with a start ; and then
he said gratefully, * But that is so like your
goodness !'

My dear, what nonsense ! You are one
of us now. Your burthens are ours. Oh, I
know well what Virginia will say when she
hears your story ! She has such a good heart.
She will say, " Bring your wife to me, Basil,
and let me try to be a mother to her ;" and
nothing will exceed her gentleness. Aline will
not be able to resist her when she sees herself
surrounded by all this kindness. She will not
be sullen any longer.'

I think he was too much touched to answer,
and we walked on in silence. It was sweet
to me to hear the assurances of his affection,

and yet In my heart I felt as though I were
robbing Virginia. She had still to win
him.

Olga was singing to herself In the dusk when
we returned ; we could hear the clear, sweet
notes through the open window. Basil made
me stand In the court-yard for a long time
listening to them.

She will not sing like that unless she believes
herself alone,' he said by way of explanation
; and, Indeed, I had never heard her sing
so well.

The rest of the evening passed very peacefully.
After supper, we sat round the window
still In the dark  and talked ; at least, Basil
talked. Olga was rather quiet. He wanted to
hear about all the people on the estate ; the
names and private history of the tenants  his
curiosity on the subject was Insatiable.

I mean to be Interested about everybody and
everything,' he finished, when I declined to
enlighten him any more.

I think we were all a little tired that night ;
but Olga came into my room to look at Reggie
in his sleep.

It Is for the last time,' she said softly, as she
kissed his closed eyelids. * He belongs to you
now, Aunt Catherine.'

I had given her Basil's message, and I

reminded her of this, but she only shook her
head.

Everything will be different,' she returned
rather sadly. ' Reggie will have his mother
and his grandmother and you ; he will not need
me then. Mr. Basil is very kind ; but he does
not understand that things must be different ;'
and then she went away without looking at him
again.

I thought of Reggie's baby-words, ' I shall
always want father and my Dear ;' and I could
not help thinking that Olga might be wrong.

The next morning Basil took Reggie down
to St. Genette to see Lizette, while Olga and
I completed our packing. They drove there
and back, so as to save the child any fatigue.
They both looked wonderfully bright on their
return.

Lizette was quite bewildered at first,' Basil
said, laughing ; ' she took Reggie for me. We
could not make her understand for a long time.
Reggie was quite alarmed. '' Reggie is Reggie !"
he kept saying; so at last she was convinced.
'* He is thy image, mon cher !" she said
presently. " I am growing old ; my eyes are
dim. I thought surely it was mon petit." Ah,
well, we have left her happy, poor old soul !
so it is a good morning's work, after all.'

We sat in the little above all the afternoon,

and Jeanne served us our coffee there. I
missed Olga after a time, and Basil said
he would go in search of her. He seemed
to know instinctively where she was to be
found.

It was growing late, so I dressed Reggie and
myself. The fiacre was at the door, and Jules
and Jeanne were bringing out the luggage.
Rollo was with his mistress. I felt a little
anxious at Olga's delay, and went out in the
lane to look for her. She and Basil were just
coming down the field-path.

There is Aunt Catherine,' I heard her say ;
and they quickened their steps.

I thought Olga seemed a little excited. She
slipped her hand in my arm as I stood waiting
for the luggage to be strapped on the fiacre.
The sun was just setting ; a sort of glorified stillness
seemed to pervade the scene. How
peaceful it all looked  the old house, with its
brown shutters, its open windows ; the courtyard,
with its sycamore ; the steep, shady lane ;
the cornfields ! There were the chickens scratching
in the dust as usual ; the gray and white
kittens frisking on the doorway ; Jeanne clattering
to the gate with one package after another.

Basil assisted us into the fiacre in silence, and
then followed us and took Reggie on his knee.

Good-bye to La Maisonnette !' exclaimed

Olga, as Jules cracked his whip. Her voice
was so sad that we both looked at her. Were
there tears in her eyes, or was it only the sunlight
? ' Good-bye to La Maisonnette, and the
dear, beautiful days that have been so happy !'

*AULD LANG SYNE.'

But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fixed and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.'

"" Jjiliiis Caesar'

He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers
While I shall have my life.'

'Henry VIW

We had a calm passage, and the September
night was so warm and pleasant that we remained
late on deck. Olga seemed to enjoy
pacing up and down in the starlight. She
yielded reluctantly to my proposition at last to
seek our berths, and secure two or three hours'
sleep ; but, after all, the suggestion was a wise
one, as it enabled us to join Basil at breakfast
feeling tolerably refreshed.

I think we all found the journey from Southampton
a little irksome. Reggie, who was still
weak from his recent illness, curled himself upon

Olga's lap, and was soon fast asleep. Every
half-hour Basil begged to relieve her, but she
always refused.

Do let me keep him,' she pleaded. ' He is
so light that I can hardly feel his weight.'

But, for all that, she looked a little weary
when we arrived at Waterloo.

Basil had secured rooms for us at Victoria.
It was quite early in the afternoon as we drove
up to our hotel ; but Reggie was already asking
to be put to bed, so we felt we had done wisely
to break the journey. It was arranged that he
was to sleep with Olga that night ; she had
begged it as a favour. We were showed at
once to our rooms ; and when Reggie had had
his tea and was comfortably tucked up in bed,
we left him under the charge of the chambermaid,
and went down to our sitting-room.

Dinner was on the table, and as soon as we
had finished we drew our chairs round the open
window and looked down on the animated
scene below. A stream of vehicles passed
every moment ; the foot-passengers were jostling
each other on the pavement ; eager faces,
gay dresses, children's voices  noise, movement
everywhere. Olga gazed down upon it all
with a grave, abstracted face. Perhaps at that
moment her thoughts were far away. Most likely
she was recalling a different scene  a steep.

shady lane, with fern-covered banks, the blue
water of the bay shining in the sunlight ; a
certain brown gate with a sycamore over it.
Near us a bell was ringing for the evening
service ; a woman was singing in the square.
We could hear her voice  a little cracked, but
not without a rude sort of melody  ' In the
gloaming'  oh, that pitiful old song, with its
sweet, reproachful plaint ! I seemed to hear it
in a sort of dream. I was thinking how Brookfield
would look tomorrow. I was longing to
hear the rooks cawing over my head, to seethe
elms with the evening light on them, to
feel Virginia's arms round me. I woke up with
a start. Olga was watching me. There was a
smile on her face.

Where is Basil, my dear ?'

He has gone down to smoke his cigarette
in the square. He will not be long. Do you
know you have been asleep, Aunt Catherine ?
We would not disturb you.'

I thought I was at Brookfield. Ah, the
woman has stopped singing now. I am so
tired of that song. I think I will go and look
at Reggie, just to see he is all right. 1 shall
not be long, and then we will have some tea to
wake us up.'

Reggie was asleep, and the chamber-maid 
a pleasant - looking young woman  was still

VOL. II. 34

beside him. Her work was over for the evening,
she said. She could wait until the young
lady came to relieve her, so I went down again.
Our sitting-room was at the end of a long corridor.
As I walked slowly down it, a gentleman
coming up the staircase attracted my attention.
He was a tall man, with iron-gray hair, and
from his dress was evidently a clergyman.
Something in his walk struck me as familiar.
The next moment he accosted me.

Would you be so good as to tell me ' he

began, and then he stopped. I suppose I was
looking at him strangely'.

Mr. Fleming !'

Catherine  good heavens !'

And then for a moment there was no other
word. I think for the minute he could not
speak. It was so sudden, so unexpected, after
all those years.

I am afraid my first speech was wholly
stupid.

How could you recognise me ?'

I might ask you the same question,' and
he gave a nervous laugh. ' It was your expression,
and the way you looked at me ;
but '

He did not finish his sentence, but I could
see then the old keen look that used to read me
so truly.

In spite of the joy of this meeting, I shrank a
little from his scrutiny.

I have changed, of course  eight-and-twenty
years would change anyone. If you had passed
me, I should have had no right to be hurt. A
man is different. A woman ages more quickly.'

I hardly knew what I was saying in my
nervousness, for he was still holding my hand,
and the clear gray eyes were still reading
me.

Eight-and-twenty years ! is it really so long
as that, Catherine ?  I beg your pardon, Miss
Seton ; but '  dropping my hand and looking
away from me  ' I should have known you anywhere
; you are wonderfully little changed considering
! We are both middle-aged people ;
but my life has been a hard one. I shall be
glad to hear that yours has been smooth.'

I forgot to return any answer to this, though
he spoke in a questioning tone. Oh, I knew
well that his life had been hard ! It was
stamped on his thin, careworn face ; the weary
stoop of his shoulders told it. In a certain
sense he had aged more than I had ; only the
vivid brightness of his eyes, and the quick,
energetic voice, recalled the Robert Fleming
of old. He had grown gray, too ; but I had
known that before.

More than one person had passed and had

342

looked at us curiously ; every moment some
door opened Into the corridor.

*We cannot stop here,' I said hurriedly.
Our sitting-room is just by ; will you come
in?'

I will come by-and-by,' he returned rather
absently ; ' but there is a friend I must see first.
Number eighty-four. Yes, that was what they
told me downstairs.'

Number eighty-four is our sitting-room,' I
observed, smiling.

He looked so perplexed at this that I was
about to explain, when an exclamation behind
us made us turn quickly. Basil was springing
up the staircase three steps at a time.

So you have come ?' was all he said ; but
the look the two men interchanged, and the
way they grasped each other's hand, was
enough to tell me what they were to each
other. As for Mr. Fleming's face, it was
illuminated.

My dear boy, have I ever failed to come
when you sent for me ?'

Never  never, my dear old friend !'

Basil, do you mean to tell me that you sent
for Mr. Fleming ?'

Why, of course !' with an astonished look at
me. ' I told you that I telegraphed from St. Croix.
Have you forgotten that, Aunt Catherine ?'

But before I could answer Mr. Fleming
interrupted us ; he was looking from one to
the other in the utmost perplexity.

Do you know this lady, Basil ? She used
to be a friend of mine in the old time.'

'So she told me. Look here, Mr. Fleming:
you ought to have waited for my letter  it
would have explained everything  instead of
rushing up to London in this impulsive way.
I was thinking about you just now as I was
smoking in the square. " I shouldn't wonder
if the dear old man puts in an appearance tonight,"
that was what I said to myself; and
then, as I came upstairs, I saw you and Aunt
Catherine together.'

My dear boy, will you answer my question ?
Are you a relative of my old friend, Miss
Seton ?'

But, after all, I would not let Basil answer.

He is Virginia's son !' I returned quickly.
Basil is her boy, and mine. He is our
father's heir  his own lawful grandson ; and
it is you  you who have cherished our boy
all these years ! Thank God that we have
met at last, and I can thank you for all your
goodness to Basil !'

He was very much surprised ; he grew quite
pale with emotion. I do not think he could
have heard such news and not be moved by it.

Come,' said Basil, throwing his arm lightly
over his shoulders, *we cannot stand out here any
longer talking about our private affairs. There
is only Miss Leigh in the sitting-room, and she
knows everything. Come in, Aunt Catherine,'
and we followed him at once.

Olga certainly looked surprised at our abrupt
entrance ; but at Basil's first word she came upto
Mr. Fleming and gave him her hand.

'You are Mr. Basil's friend,' she said in her
pretty girlish way. ' Oh, we know all about
you ; he is always talking of you ! I am so
glad that you have come at last ; it is a great
pleasure  is it not. Aunt Catherine ?' and then
she gave me a quick, loving look. ' Now I
must go to Reggie ; and there is so much that
you three will have to say to each other ;' and
before any of us could stop her she had left the
room.

I sat down by the open window, and left
Basil undisturbed to tell his story. Mr. Fleming
made him go back to the beginning. He
described his life in the pavilion ; his first
meeting with Olga ; our kindness to Reggie ;
the child's illness, and all that followed ; Pere
Lefevre's story ; and the visit to Lizette Dupont.


Ah, poor Lizette ! I remember her well !'
observed Mr. Fleming, with much feeling.

She was a faithful creature. But for her
you would have fared badly, Basil. How
strange, how marvellous, it all seems ! To
think all these years I had a Seton living
under my roof; that the boy I thought was
friendless and penniless was the heir to Brookfield
Hall ! Leave me to think over it for a
moment ; your story has almost taken my
breath away.'

'Aunt Catherine shall make us some tea,'
returned Basil gaily. ' I am thirsty with so
much talking. I have had more than my share.'
Then, as he followed me to the table, he said
curiously : ' What was the waiter saying to you
just now ? was it about Miss Leigh ?'

Yes ; Olga had pencilled me a little note.
Reggie was awake and she could not leave him,
so she wished us all good-night. The chambermaid
had brought her some tea, and she was
quite comfortable, and she said again how glad
she was Mr. Fleming had come.'

Miss Leigh knows exactly when to efface
herself. Yes, it is just like her ; but she would
not have been in the way.' Mr. Fleming overheard
him as he joined us.

Who is that young lady with the pretty
voice  whom I fear that I have banished from
the room ? is she a protegee of yours, Miss
Seton ?'

Yes, virginia and I are ver' fond of her.
Olga is charming when one knows her w(rll.
Do you remember Fircroft, that old red house
near the church ? she lives there with her
brother. Mr. Leigh is our curate-in-charge.'

Yes, I remember Fircroft ; it was to let in
my time ; old Miss Crowder had just died.
When I have time I must ask after a few of my
Brookfield friends. I have a tenacious memory
it will astonish you ; but there is another subject
we have not mentioned : I have not yet
asked after your wife, Basil.' His voice was
grave, and he looked fixedly at the young man
as he spoke.

She is well ; at least. I believe so,' returned
Basil in an embarrassed tone. * She is with
George at present.'

The anxious look deepened on Mr. Fleming's
face.

My dear boy. you have not left her ?'

Only for a month or two ; one must have
change sometimes. Holloway was driving me
mad, so I thought it best to go away for a little.
She let me take the boy ; I couldn't have gone
without him ; she knew that.'

And things are no better ?'

They never will be. George manages to
keep her straight for a little ; but it never lasts
long  it never can with Aline.'

Poor girl ! poor girl ! and yet in her way she
is good to you ; are you '  and then he looked
at me and hesitated  ' do you mean to bring
your wife to Brooked Hall ?'

I suppose I must ;' but I interposed :

We shall go and fetch her together. Basil's
burthens are ours now ; we must share them
together. If he be unhappy, we shall be unhappy
too.'

A peculiar softness came into Mr. Fleming's
eyes ; but he looked at Basil, not at me.

You will not be unhappy, my boy, with
such friends to help you. Your wife is young,
there may be hope still ; do not leave her with
her brother too long. mr. Barton is a goodman
in his way ; but we must not shift our
responsibilities on to other men's shoulders ; no
one can relieve you of a husband's duty to that
poor girl'

Basil flushed as though the advice were unpalatable
to him ; he threw up his head a little
proudly. ' I know ; you need not tell me,' he
said bitterly. ' I have brought the misery on
myself and must abide by it. If a man acts like
a fool, he must pay for it.'

It was the old reckless tone. As he heard it,
Mr. Fleming rose and put his hand on his
shoulder. 'I am at my old quarters, and it is
getting late ; will you walk across the Park with

me ?  you can smoke your cigarette and we can
finish our talk.' And then 1 knew that he
wanted to be alone with Basil, his boy as well
as mine  that my presence was a restraint. I
thought Basil agreed to this proposition a little
reluctantly ; perhaps he dreaded the clear-sighted
judgment of his mentor ; but Mr.
Fleming did not appear to notice it. The
sudden leave-taking troubled me ; he had said
so little to me or I to him ; it was Basil who
had engrossed him. A chilly feeling of disappointment
crept over me as I thought how long
it might be before we met again.

To my surprise he seemed to answer this
thought.

It is not good-bye,' he said quietly ; * Basil
tells me that you do not leave until mid-day tomorrow.
I should like to come and see you
again  may I ?'

I shall be very glad.'

Then I will come.' He seemed to wait until
Basil had left the room, and then he came a
little closer.

I should like to talk to you about Basil ; he
has been very dear all these years  he is still 
I have missed him terribly.'

I am afraid he has not always treated you
well.'

Never mind that now ; with all his faults he

has been like a son to me. Well, it has been a
great pleasure finding you two together ; goodbye
 God bless you !' and before I could
answer he was gone.

The room looked a little solitary, and I went
up to Olga. She was sitting by the open window ;
she seemed surprised to see me.

Has Mr. Fleming gone already ?'

Yes, dear, and he has taken Basil with him.
He wanted a long quiet talk with him. Why
have you not gone to bed, Olga ? And you
are so tired.'

'Not so very tired'  wrapping my arms
round her and leaning against me, a favourite
action of hers in some moods. ' Aunt Catherine,
were you not very glad to meet your old friend
again ?'

Very glad indeed.'

I should have liked to have seen more of
him ; but of course I knew I was in the way.
He is just what I thought. Do you know, his
face reminds me a little of yours. No ; I
cannot explain it '  as I uttered an incredulous
exclamation  * but you have both got the same
clear, earnest look  what Jessie calls a trust-able
look.'

My dear, I am very much obliged to you
and Jessie.'

He is not young, of course  his hair is

quite gray. How old did you say he

was ?'

Mr. Fleming must be fifty ; his work has
aged him.'

Yes ; and then his life has not been a happy
one.'

We do not know that, Olga,' rather quickly.

Do we not i*'  with a lite laugh. ' Well, I
must not keep you here talking. I suppose he
is coming again tomorrow ?'

I do not know why you should suppose any
such thing ; but for once you happen to be
correct.'

It would be very strange if he did not come.
He and Mr. Basil must want to be together.'

Oh yes, of course ;' and then she kissed me
affectionately and let me go.

I was glad to be alone with my own thoughts.
After all these years God had granted me my
wish: I had looked in the face of Robert Fleming
again  the man to whom I had plighted my
girlish troth, for whose sake I had lived single
and the meeting had not disappointed me. I
had seen the quick flash of joy in his eyes ashe
pronounced my name. Would he have
called me Catherine in that momentary confusion
if the past had been wholly obliterated
from his mind ? if the girl Catherine had been
forgotten ? I held to this thread of comfort

firmly, when the cold waters of common-sense
came to damp my enthusiasm.

Let me confess it : I did not long remain
happy. Many a woman of my age has these
sudden chills of introspection and retrospection,
these dim brooding moods, when we are
brought face to face with our inner selves, when
we look with dreary, pitying eyes on our dead
youth, on the hopes that lie in faded heaps like
autumn leaves. All those years, in which we
might have been so happy  does not the strain .
run after that fashion ? All those fresh
womanly feelings wasted in waiting for something
that never came  in that wistful watching
that too often ends in heart-sickness and
despair !

After all, if he had cared for me as I had
cared for him, would he not have trampled
down his pride underfoot and came back to me
not in my father's lifetime, perhaps, but when
his death had set me free ? And  and  I will
write it here  I had expected him month after
month, and year after year, and he had made
no sign ! No ; he had never come back to the
Catherine he had so tenderly loved, whom,
strong man as he was, it almost broke his heart
to give up ! But in my inmost mind I had not
been angry with him. It was his notion of
honour  strained and misplaced, perhaps, but

Still a sense of honour  that had refused to
seek out the heiress. Alost likely he thought
himself forgotten. He had not loved again,
that was certain ; and this knowledge, poor and
meagre as it was, was the abiding sweetness of
my life.

What poor creatures we women are ! We
can bear disappointment, suspense, unhappiness,
but we cannot endure that one whom we
love should forget us. No ; this one thing we
cannot bear !

It was some time before I could reason and
school myself into calmness ; as the bitter waters
of the past, that had submerged all my youthful
hopes, seemed to rise again before my eyes, a
sort of dual voice seemed to oppose vague
utterances.

After all, you have had a happy life,' one
seemed to say. * Many women have to do without
love and marriage  it is Kismet, Fate, the
will of God. You have had your freedom, wealth,
plenty of work, friends to cheer your leisure.'

Yes, but I have been lonely through it all
murmured that other unbidden voice. ' I have
had no strong arm to lean upon ; all my life I
have wanted my other self. When I have seen
wives with their husbands, mothers with their
children, I have felt my freedom an irksome
thing, my wealth mere emptiness. The will of

God ! Ah, well, you are right. It may be so ;
but I think our heavenly Father knows why
the eyes of women are so often dim, and their
tears do not make Him angry.'

Most likely you have cared for Robert
Fleming more than he has cared for you,' went
on the voice ;  this reflection ought to humiliate
you. A little while ago you had settled to make
him your heir.'

I do not feel humiliated ; such a reflection
would not trouble me for a moment. What
does it matter on which side the lovelies ? He
was my master once, and taught me all I knew
of good ; I had no religion until he instilled it ;
I owe my better self to him  to his high-minded
example ; he loved me once : that is sufficient.'

This is mere sophistical nonsense. At your
age one should think more wisely.'

It is the truth, and I know no other. As
long as Robert Fleming lives, the world will be
richer to me. I ask nothing from him but
friendship, esteem, a kindly recollection of the
past ; more would embarrass  would trouble
me  would disturb my sense of fitness. I
neither ask nor desire it ; but if I could only do
him some good, I think I should die happier /
and with this curious confession of womanly
faith I triumphed over my dissentient voice.

I grew quite reasonable at last, and

chided myself in earnest for the hours I had
wasted in fruitless regrets. 'You are not the
only one,' I said to myself severely, ' whom
Heaven has deprived of complete satisfaction in
this world. There are so many widowed lives 
meek, uncomplaining ones  lives so patiently
borne that even the angels must wonder at
them, and you  you have had so many blessings
;' and then, touched and humbled, I knelt
down to say my thanksgiving, and after that I
slept as sweetly as ever ; and when morning
came I woke quite happily, for was I not going
home with Basil ? and was that not happiness
enough ? besides which  but I have written
enough on that subject.

When we met at breakfast it was Basil who
looked as though he had not slept. He did not
deny the charge.

One can't stand so much excitement,' he
said, laughing rather nervously. ' I suppose
that long talk unsettled me, and then I kept
thinking about my mother. I cannot help
dreading the meeting. What am I to say to her,
and she to me, when we are strangers to each
other ?' and then he broke off as Olga came
into the room with Reggie, and it seemed a
relief to him to take the little fellow in his arms.
Poor Basil ! I could feel for him ; it was terribly
embarrassing.

Mr. Fleming came quite early. Basil took
Reg-gie half across the park to meet him, and
they all came in together. Basil had almost
lost that fagged, harassed look. As soon as
Mr. Fleming had shaken hands with us, Basil
accosted me eagerly :

Aunt Catherine, such a capital idea has come
into my head : why should not Mr. Fleming
come down with us to Brookfield ?'

To Brookfield ?' I faltered.

Yes ; it will make things easier for all of us.
I should like it. I shall feel more like myself if
he is there to back me up ; and my mother
ought to see him, you know.'

My dear boy, it is you who are master ; you
may surely ask whom you will to your own
house.'

1 never thought of that,' with a flush ; ' and
I will do nothing without your permission.
Shall he come, Aunt Catherine ?'

If he will be so good,' I returned, smiling.

Mr. Fleming had remained silent ; but I
could see this wish on Basil's part touched him
profoundly.

Will you come, Mr. Fleming ?'

Go and ask him, Reggie,' whispered Basil in
his boy's ear ; and the child, in his ready, sweet
obedience, ran up to him. Mr. Fleming stooped
over him.

VOL. II. 35

What is it, my little fellow ?' he said gently.

Reggie wants you to come, and father, too,

and my Dear ' looking round for Olga, ' and

Aunt Cathy,' for he could not pronounce my
name.

'What, all  everybody? I think I must
come, Reggie ; father's wishes have always been
paramount with me. But this young lady,' looking
at Olga with kindly, observant eyes, ' I
think you made a mistake there ;' and then he
put down the child and walked to the window ;
and, after a moment's hesitation, Basil followed
him, and they talked earnestly together ; and,
though Olga and I could not hear what they
were saying, there was a pleased look on Mr.
Fleming's face  a bright, happy look that told
us volumes.

'WELCOME HOME, MY DEAR.'

O, Lord ! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son !
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world !
My widow comfort, and my sorrow's cure.'

King John.'
O Lord, that lends me life,
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness.'

Second Part of ' Henry IV.'

Just before we started, I found myself alone
with Mr. Fleming. I had gone upstairs to put
on my bonnet, and on my return to the sitting-room
I saw him standing at the window apparently
lost in thought.

My entrance roused him. As he came towards
me, I noticed that he looked younger
and brighter than he had yesterday. His
shoulders seemed to have lost their stoop. ?Ie
seemed alert  full of animation.

I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking
to you,' he began quickly. ' 1 am afraid

352

my boy has been a little impulsive. Are you
sure that I shall not be in the way  that Mrs.
Lyndhurst will not think it an intrusion ?'

 I can answer for Virginia's welcome as well
as my own,' I returned gravely. ' Mr. Fleming,
cannot you understand how deeply we are indebted
to you ? You have been our benefactor
as well as Basil's. When Virginia learns how
all these years you have been guarding her
treasure, there will be no limit to her gratitude.'

You must not say such things to me. Miss
Seton. It troubles me to hear them.'

Then they shall not be said. I would not
hurt you for the world. Let me tell you instead
how glad 1 am for Basil's sake that you are with
him at this crisis of his life.'

He is very nervous about this meeting with
his mother,' he said thoughtfully. * He has confessed
to me that he dreads it beyond everything.
It is unfortunate that Mrs. Lyndhurst would
never consent to be photographed, for he cannot
picture her in the least. He seemed quite
surprised when I told him what a handsome
girl she used to be.'

That is because your description does not
tally with ours. Eight-and-twenty years ago,
I grant you, Virginia was a beautiful creature.
When you see her, you will not recognise her as
you recognised me.'

Is she so changed ?'

Changed ! that is not the word. Strangers
have often told me that it made their hearts
ache only to look at her. Her troubles have
been too much for her. Her nerves have
suffered.'

I understand  Basil told me a great deal
last night.'

He says very little about his mother to me,
and I am half afraid to question him. I should
like to know what he really feels about her.'

It is difficult to judge,' he replied after a
moment's hesitation. ' He is very guarded.
He does not speak openly even to me. I can
see he feels her desertion of him in his helpless
infancy very keenly, and yet no word of blame
passes his lips ; but it has chilled him. No,
you must not grieve," as the tears rose to my
eyes, and he looked at me very kindly. ' It is
only natural he should feel it, but we must
hope that mother and son will soon be drawn
together.'

I think if she fails to win his love my
poor Virginia will break her heart. Any
coldness on Basil's part will crush her. Mr.
Fleming, will you tell him so ? I have gone
through so much that I feel I can bear no
more.'

I would willingly spare you all pain if I

could he returned gently ; ' but, pardon me, I
think I understand Basil better than you do.
We must leave him to himself; he has a good
heart. We must trust that. Any advice would
only embarrass him. You saw for yourself last
night how hard it is for him to take even a word
from me. It has always been like that  his
pride has been his bane.'

He has never been proud with me.'

That is because you are so gentle with him.
I can see for myself how much influence you
have with him already. He was talking to me
about you last night. He thinks there is no one
like you. You would have been pleased to hear
him.'

Mr. Fleming, will you tell me one thing : Is
it your opinion that Basil is to blame at all with
regard to his wife ?'

He looked sorry that I had asked the question.
He hesitated, and seemed unwilling to
answer.

You have put a very difficult question. I
should have liked you to judge for yourself.
Basil is very much to be pitied. No one could
deny that he leads a wretched life with that
poor girl ; but it has always been my opinion
that he might have done more for her in the
beginning.'

I am afraid he has ceased to love her.'

It was never real love.' he returned warmly.
It was just a young man's fancy for a handsome
girl that would have cooled in a month or
two. He very soon grew weary of her. A
woman of her calibre could never hold him
long. When I first saw her, I knew there
would be no happiness for him in the future.
Poor boy ! he needed more than she could give
him, and yet she loved him with all the strength
of her undisciplined nature.'

You think that Aline loves him. Basil
assures me that she is quite indifferent  that
she seldom speaks to him.'

That comes of her sullen temper. She
is jealous, too ; and she knows that she has
forfeited all claims to his respect. I believe in
her way the poor girl suffers terribly. She has
fits of remorse that are quite distressing to
witness. I believe if Basil spoke kindly to her
then she would be ready to die for him ; but he
has lost all heart and interest. He tells me
that he never troubles himself now about her
moods.'

Mr. Fleming, you will think me hard, too ;
but I am afraid I take Basil's part. How is he
to bear with such a woman ?'

You have not seen her,' he answered
quickly. ' I should not be surprised if she
interested you in spite of yourself ; there are

possibilities even in her nature, poor thing" !
She is the victim of others' sins ; an hereditary
taint is in her blood. Her brother knows this,
and pities and shields her ; it is only her
husband who has no mercy.'

But what would you have him do ? He is
going to bring her home.'

Yes, he will bring her home ; but will he be
good to her ? Will he watch over her, and
keep the deadly poison away ? Will he try to
wean her from her fatal habit by surrounding
her with other influences, and teaching her self-respect
? Will he stay with her instead of
rushing away to seek distraction for himself,
and taking his boy with him ? Miss Seton,
you must not think mc hard ; my heart bleeds
for him ; but right is right. Basil has made that
girl his wife, and he must do his duty by her,
as other men have done theirs. It is no
question of love ; it is clear, manifest duty.
This is what I have told him, and he does not
contradict me.'

No, he will not contradict you ; but his life
will be terribly difficult  and he is so young.'

She is young, too.'

'Yes, I know;' and then we could say no
more, as we heard Basil's voice outside.

I was glad to have had even this brief talk.
I knew now what were Mr. Fleming's opinions

with regard to Aline. In some respects they
corroborated the impressions I had already
formed. I felt Basil had not been faultless  
his long absences, his restless wanderings, his
absorption in his boy, had widened the breach
between husband and wife. Aline had lost
all incentive to self-control ; she despaired of
regaining Basil's love ; most likely she was
trying to drown her sense of neglect and
wretchedness ; but, on the other hand, what
superhuman patience was needed to endure the
daily companionship of such a woman! It
was easy for a man like Mr. Fleming to preach
the duty he so nobly practised of self-abnegation
; but for Basil, with his sensitive nature,
his pride, his impatient irritability, it was
more difficult ; and in my heart I could not
blame him ; and he had already suffered so
much.

I think but for INIr. Fleming we should have
been a silent party ; but he helped us all to
feel more natural and at our ease. Basil's
nervousness seemed to increase as we drew
towards our journey's end ; he talked fitfully.
As we slackened speed, Olga, who had been
very quiet, suddenly brightened.

Oh, there is Jem !' she said. ' Rollo, look !
there is dear old Jem !' and Rollo whined
expectantly, as though he understood.

Is that your brother ?' exclaimed Basil ; ' I
should like to shake hands with him. What a
fine-looking fellow !'

But I doubt if Olga heard him, for she was
waving and kissing her hand to Jem. I smile
now when I recall Jem's look of astonishment
as the two gentlemen followed us out of the
carriage. As Basil's dark face peered over my
shoulder, I heard Jem whisper in a sort of
disgusted aside :

Why, you haven't brought that fellow
Fleming over with you, surely ?'

I only hoped it was not audible. Olga
hardly knew how to answer, so I thought it
politic to explain matters.

This is my old friend Mr. Fleming, Jem ;
but now let me introduce you to my nephew,
Basil Lyndhurst. Basil, this is Miss Leigh's
brother, of whom you have heard so much.'

Jem's face was a study as they shook hands
rather stiffly. The whole thing was so droll
that Olga and I began to laugh ; but this did
not mend matters.

I was not aware you had a nephew. Miss
Seton,' replied Jem, in a dignified manner, and
turning very red. (He had never called me
anything but Aunt Catherine for years.) ' I
am very glad to make your acquaintance, Mr.
Lyndhurst. Olga, I have got a truck for your

luggage. I thought you would like the walk upto
Fircroft.'

Yes, I will come, Jem. Dear Aunt
Catherine, good-bye until tomorrow ! Give
my love to Mrs. Lyndhurst.*

But you will bring Jem with you tomorrow,
Olga ? I want him and Basil to be good
friends.'

I will bring him if he will come. Good-bye,
Mr. Basil ! Good-bye, my darling Reggie !'
kneeling on the ground to kiss him.

Jem watched these proceedings a little stonily.
When she had finished, he took off his hat tous
all with a grand sweep, and drew Olga's
hand through his arm, and hurried her away.
I smiled to myself as I looked after them.
Poor Olga ! she would have some trouble in
soothing him. Jem was not one to like
mysteries ; he had been too much taken by
surprise, and he was ruffled in consequence.
Basil made a little speech presently that amused
me still more.

Mr. Leigh seems rather haughty for such a
frank-looking fellow. On the whole, he did
not seem quite pleased with me.'

You don't know Jem,' was my reply ; * he
will be quite different tomorrow. He thinks
Olga ought to have prepared him ; he hates
surprises. Never mind ; there is our faithful

old Jennings with the carriage. You must
speak to him, Basil.'

Basil's nervousness seemed to return as he
seated himself beside me, for Mr. Fleming
insisted on taking the opposite place. Olga
looked up at us as we passed with a tremulous
little smile, and waved her hand. Jem was
still holding her arm ; he raised his hat stiffly,
with the gravity of a young judge. Basil looked
back at them once or twice.

There is Fircroft,' I said presently ; * do
you hear the rooks, Basil ? Look ! we shall
turn into the avenue directly  you can seethe
Hall now ; and  and  welcome home, my
dear !'

He pressed my hand, but did not answer ; he
had grown strangely pale, and there was a
strained look in his eyes, as though he were
expecting to see someone. How grandly the
rooks were cawing over our heads  as though
they were greeting the long-lost heir ! I doubt
whether Basil even heard them, any more than
he noticed the flecks of golden sunshine on the
green turf, or the play of light and shadow in
the branches of the elms. My dear old home !
How lovely it looked that September afternoon
! My eyes were misty with unshed tears ;
a flood of gratitude was in my heart. Oh, how
good Providence had been to us ! I looked at

Mr. Fleming ; his grave answering glance, so
full of unspoken sympathy, of complete understanding,
satisfied me. I was not the only one
to rejoice that day !

The Hall door was wide open ; I could see
Bennet's white head, with our old housekeeper,
Mrs. Larkins, behind him. As the carriage
stopped, and Reynolds sprang from the box to
open the door, I saw Marsden cross the hall
hurriedly, as though in search of her mistress.

I took Basil's hand as we stood together on
the threshold ; he had a dazed look, as though
he were in a dream ; he acknowledged the
servants' respectful greeting almost mechanically.


Mrs. Lyndhurst is in the drawing-room,
ma'am,' Bennet said in my ear ; and I put my
hand on Basil's arm to rouse him.

Come, my dear, come ! We must not keep
your mother waiting ; she is an invalid, remember
;' and 1 drew him on.

Once he stumbled slightly ; the hall was dark
after the sunshine outside, and the oak floor
slippery to unused footsteps. I felt him draw
his breath hard as Bennet opened the drawings
door. And then for the moment I thought
I was dreaming, too ; for the Virginia who stood
in the middle of the room to receive us was not
the Virginia I had left  who had lived with me

all these years. For a second I did not recognise
her.

The frail graceful figure that seemed always
bowed by some mysterious weakness was erect
and tall ; in place of the straight black folds of
her widowlike stuff dress, she wore black velvet,
and that in spite of the sumner warmth. A
little head-dress of costly lace just shaded the
silvery hair, and as I crossed the room I could
see she had a diamond ornament at her throat,
and that her hands were blazing with diamond
rings  Virginia, who had not worn jewels for
five-and-twenty years ! But how deathly was
the marble paleness of her face as she stretched
out her hands tremblingly to her boy.

My son  ni)' own son !'

Mother !'

Just that one word, uttered under his breath,
as though that low passionate utterance compelled
response and recognition ; and as she
looked up in his face with those pleading eyes,
he stooped and kissed her quietly, reverend
on the cheek. He told me afterwards that the
touch of that cold thin cheek gave him a sort of
shock. As for Virginia, that timid, quiet caress
from the full-grown man, who was her son and
yet a stranger, seemed to unseal the pent-up
emotion ; she trembled so violently that I
thought she would have fallen, and Basil

quickly put his arm round her and drew her to
a seat. She kept hold of his hand.

You are very kind,' she gasped. 'Will you
sit down beside me ? you are so tall '  trying to
smile  'and I  I want to see my son.'

He obeyed her at once, but he seemed
nervous and embarrassed under that long fixed
look. As for me, I knew what it meant ;
the mother's eyes were seeking some resemblance
she feared to see. Oh, she had found
it!

Catherine !' How well I knew that sharp
thinness of voice ! ' Catherine, he is like Paul !
It is Paul's mouth  his handsome mouth  and
he has his father's chin. You told me in your
letter that there was no likeness : you are
wrong ; and, look, he has Paul's hand !  I
should have known that hand anywhere !'

What does it matter ?' I returned, somewhat
alarmed at this ; ' Basil does not take
after his father in anything else.'

No '  after a moment's hesitation  ' and,
after all. I am. glad that it should be so ; it
makes him still more my son. I can see the
likeness for myself. Basil '  how softly and
tenderly she pronounced his name !  * you must
not mind anything I have said. I have
suffered so much ; and all these years, these
long, cruel sears, I have been childless.'

Yes, I know ; but he did not look at her ashe
spoke.

I could see his position tried him terribly 
that he did not know what to say to her.
Whose fault was it that he had been a stranger
to his home all those years ? that he had been
forsaken in his helpless infancy and cast upon
the compassion of strangers ? Could he tell her
so ? But the thought would not be banished ;
it kept him silent.

An agonized expression crossed Virginia's
face, as though she read his silence truly.

Catherine, do you see ? he has nothing to
say to me ! My son turns from me  from
me, his mother ! He has hardened his heart
against me because of that past sin of mine !
He has judged me already; and I  what shall
I do ?'

She wrung her hands, and it was pitiful to
see her poor quivering face. It was too much
for Basil ; he started up, and began pacing the
room. It was some minutes before he could
calm himself sufficiently to speak to her, and
all the time she sat, poor soul ! watching him,
and sighing as though her heart would break.
Presently he came back to us.

Mother,' he said almost harshly, but I saw
he had some difficulty in keeping himself in
hand, ' you ought not to have said that  that

should never have been mentioned between
you and me. What is past is past. You are
wrong ; your son does not judge his mother ;
he has too many sins of his own.'

He sank down on the couch beside her and
covered his face with his hands ; his strong
young frame seemed shaking with emotion.

Virginia,' I said gently, ' Basil is right ; you
ought not to have spoken to him in that way.
He does not wish to remember the past ; you
must never recall it to him. It is a new life
that is beginning for you both to-day  a new
and happier life.'

Is it T she returned softly, and she laid her

hand on his arm. She was his mother, but she

dare not venture on a closer caress. ' Yes, I

know ; for this my son was dead, and is alive

again ; he was lost, and is found.'

* # # *

We grew calmer by degrees. Basil was the
first to recover himself. I saw by his manner
that he was anxious to efface the impression
from Virginia's mind, to place things on a more
natural footing. She had entreated him with
tears to forgive her, and his answer had soothed
her.

It is not for a parent to ask forgiveness of
a child,' he had said. ' My father's sins have
been so great that I wonder you do not hate

VOL. II. 36

me for my likeness to him. Do not let there
be any such question between us.'

Then you do forgive me, Basil ?'

What ! again, mother ? And, after all, I
have no right ; but, if you will have it, I
freely forgive you. Now that is finished, and
we will never refer to it again. And I want
you to see my boy ; you have two children,
you know !'

Your boy !' and her manner was a little
bewildered.

Had she forgotten all 1 had told her in my
letter of Basil's unhappy marriage ?

Yes  Reggie. Will you fetch him, Aunt
Catherine ? Do you mind ? I do not know
my way about the house ;' and I went willingly.

It was some minutes before I returned to the
room ; I thought it was better to leave them
together. On our way through the hall I endeavoured
to impress on Reggie's mind that he
was going to see his grandmother. I wanted
him to say the word after me, but he refused.

'Too long,' he said, shaking his head;
Reggie don't like it !'

I am afraid we had all spoiled him, and
indulged his childish whims. He was dressed
in his white sailor's suit, and, in spite of the
loss of his hair, he looked so delicately pretty
that I knew how Virginia would admire him.

His erect little figure was so trim and graceful ;
he carried his head with such dignity, and he
was such a friendly, loving little creature.

He marched up straight to his father and
stood beside him, looking with childish curiosity
at Virginia's pale face.

Is that lady Reggie's Gran ?' he asked at
last.

Yes, dear. Will you give her a kiss ?'

It was evident Reggie did not relish the idea
of the kiss ; but he was accustomed to obey his
father's slightest word, so he put up his face at
once.

How do you do. Gran ?' he said gravely ;
and Virginia caught him in her arms and burst
into tears.

Reggie regarded her with astonished eyes.

Has anyone been naughty, father ?' he
asked in great perplexity. ' Why does Gran
cry ?'

 Let me cry, darling ; it does me good. Oh,
Cathy, Cathy ! look at this dear little face, and
think  think of that little child I never saw 
that lonely little child who never knew his
mother !' and for a little while she sobbed
bitterly, and refused to be comforted.

Reggie looked so frightened that Basil took
him on his knee, and after a time we were
obliged to send him away. Virginia was

362

becoming hysterical ; her frail form could ill
support her overcharged feelings. It was Basil
who proposed sending for Mr. Fleming  I had
not once thought of him. I was a little dubious
as to the result, but, as it proved, Basil was
right.

He had been accustomed to all forms of
mental distress ; his very first words as he took
her hand seemed to soothe her.

All this has been too niuch for you,' he said
gently. ' You have no strength left to thank
God for the great blessing He has vouchsafed
you to-day. Miss Seton, I think you must
give your sister some wine, and then she will
feel better ;' and without heeding her wild sobs
he said a few grave, strong words that seemed
to lift her out of her self-abasement and place
her on a higher level.

It was wonderful to hear him talk. He
seemed to understand just how she felt.

Basil,' he said, turning to him by-and-by,
you have a grand task before you : you have
to compensate your mother for all her past unhappiness
; you have to win her love and confidence.'


The love is won already,' she returned, with
a wan smile.

So much the better,' he returned heartily.
But, Mrs. Lyndhurst, your son needs something

more than love at your hand  he will
want real help and sympathy. He has told
you about his wife ?'

No,' she said timidly. ' There has been no
time, and I have troubled him so ; but Catherine
said something in her letter. You are not
happy, Basil ?'

No, mother, I am not happy. Aline is a
great trouble to me.'

Aline  is that your wife's name ? My dear,
you must tell me everything, and I will help
you. We will both help him  will we not,
Catherine ? There is nothing  nothing we
will not do. You shall not be unhappy, my
son, if your mother can prevent it. There
will be no sacrifice too great  you may be sure
of that.'

Will you do something for me now, mother ?'
taking her hand.

It was pathetic to see how she brightened
every time he said that word ; she looked at
him with unutterable tenderness as he spoke.

Yes, surely, Basil'

Will you go and rest now ? It hurts me to
see you look so frightfully pale. You are ill,
though you do not say so. I should be happier
in my mind if you would rest.'

I will go, then,' rising at once. * Cathy,
will you come to me presently ?  not now ; I

must be alone a little. Thank you, my dear,'
as Basil gave her his arm, and led her to the
door.

I did not hear what she said to him, but there
were a few words on her part, and then he
stooped over her again and kissed her.

'friends for life

'Who reverenced his conscience as his being.'

Tennyson.

Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel.'

Hamlet:

I WAS perfectly aware of the reason that made
Mr. Fleming remember suddenly that he had
an important letter to write before the evening
post. Like Olga, he knew when to efface himself;
some unerring intuition told him that I
should prefer to be alone with Basil. The
moment the door closed after him, I went up to
Basil and took his two hands.

Well, my dear ?'

He looked at me with an expression that
was difficult to define  a curious mingling of
pleasure and sadness.

Aunt Catherine he said slowly, ' 1 am glad
my mother is like that.'

Oh, Basil ! Really and truly ? Then you
are not disappointed in her ?'

No '  drawing a long breath  * but you
must not question me too closely ; you must
give me time. Do you not see '  very gravely
' what a trial this has been to both of us  to
her as well as to me ? One hardly dared to
speak for fear of wounding the other ; there
was a barrier across which we seemed to look at
each other. Thank God it is over  that I shall
never have to live through such an hour again !'
Dear Basil, I quite understand how you
felt.'

I think when it came to the point that I
would rather have walked up to the cannon's
mouth than have entered that room. All these
days I have been saying to myself, " If I should
be disappointed in my mother !" I was growing
quite morbid over the idea.'

Very few men have to pass through such an
ordeal ; but it has ended well'

Yes, it has ended well ; no one could have
been kinder. Do you know, Aunt Catherine,
I was glad in my heart when she spoke of my
likeness to my father ; it seemed somehow
more satisfactory ; but I would rather have resembled
my mother.'

I am so pleased to hear you say that.'

Why, she is lovely !' he returned quickly ;

When she spoke, something in her voice reminded
me of you ; but you are not really
alike.'

Not in the least.'

No, there could not be two sisters more
unlike each other. I can understand now
what Mr. Fleming told me about her beauty 
she is very sweet-looking ; but of course one
can see what her life has been ; there is one
thing I am sure that she needs : a son to take
care of her.'

My dear, it makes me so happy to hear you

talk in this way ! I was so afraid ' but

something in his look warned me not to say
any more.

I know what you were going to say,' he
returned ; ' but that is a forbidden subject ;
for heaven's sake, Aunt Catherine, let the dead
past bury its dead. Why should we try to disinter
the ghastly thing ? That is the worst of
women, they are so fond of moral dissection ;
even a good woman knows the use of a scalpel.'

You are very hard on us,' pretending to
look offended ; but he was too much in earnest
to heed me.

Men are more generous ; when they forgive,
they forgive thoroughly, and with no arriere-
pense ; that is how I feel about things. We
must wipe out the past ; there must be no allusion

to it  no painful remembrance ; this is what
I feel strongly. Do you not see how much
need I have to forget ? If I had lived here under
my mother's roof, I should never have met
Aline. I  I dare not think of it ;' there was a
cloud upon his face as he spoke  a concentrated
bitterness in his voice ; then he recovered himself:
' For pity's sake let me keep that thought
away ; it would madden me to think of what
might have been. Aunt Catherine,' looking at
me wistfully, ' I want to be a better sort of
fellow ; I want to do my duty, and not to think
of my own happiness. You must help me with
Aline. You must keep me up to things ; neither
she nor I must disgrace my mother, who has
suffered so much all her life.'

I was so touched that I could not answer
him ; if only Mr. Fleming had heard him !

Do not let us talk any more,' he said
presently ; ' all this has taken it out of me ; 1
feel dead tired, as though I had walked twenty
miles. Will you come out in the garden ? a little
fresh air will do me good ; do you mind ?''

As though I minded anything ! He opened
the glass-door, and we stepped out on the lawn.
I showed him everything ; the Lady's Walk,
and my favourite Elizabethan garden, with the
sundial and peacocks. He wanted to fetch
Reggie at once to see them ; but I told him the

child would be having his tea in the nursery,
and beoored him not to disturb him. 1 could
see Reggie was in his thoughts perpetually.

Fancy the little chap chasing butterflies over
that lawn !' he said once, ' and how pleased he
will be with the honeysuckle arbour ! He must
have a garden of his own  that little bed we
passed just now. And he will take up his
flowers to see how they grow ! and he will
water them six times a day out of his new
watering-pot ; can't you fancy him doing it ?'
Then, by-and-by : ' That was a velvet dress
my mother wore, was it not ? I always had a
fancy for velvet. Don't you think Reg might
have a velvet suit with a lace collar ? he would
look like a picture ! I saw a little boy once
dressed like that, and it struck me then how it
would suit Reggie.'

Oh yes, he would look lovely,' and, just to
humour him, I discussed the rival merits of ruby
and dark-blue velvet. I saw that he was
trying to fling off his grave mood. When we
had explored the garden, and I wanted him
to come in and see the house, he shook his
head.

I could not take in any more to-day,' he
said wearily, ' and it is so delicious out here !
Let us take a turn in the avenue and listen to
those black-coated fellows. Hark ! what is

that ?' as the sudden pealing of bells broke on
our ears.

It is Mr. Leigh's thoughtfulness,' I cried
breathlessly. ' Olga had told him, and he has
just trot the ringers together.'

Do you mean it is for me ?' looking quite
scared.

'Yes, dear; it is in your honour. It is a
welcome to the heir the young squire of
Brookfield. If they had known, Basil  if we
had given them time  all your tenants would
have been at the station to receive you. There
would have been triumphal arches and flags ;
the Bedfellows, with their band ; and the vicar
at least, the curate-in-charge  would have
made you a speech.'

Oh, Heaven forbid !' he returned, quite
shocked at the idea. ' I could not have undergone
it.'

I could not help laughing at his evident discomposure.
With all his pride, he had nota
spark of vanity ; there was nothing little
in his nature ; his faults were big glaring
faults, but there was no meanness.

All the same, they will feel we have cheated
them. We must have a supper and a dance for
the tenants later on. You must not shrink from
your responsibilities.'

No,' he said softly ; ' I must face everything.

How pleased Reggie will be with those
bells !'

We were standing in the avenue. I do not
know what impulse moved Basil to take off his
hat and stand bareheaded and silent. There
was a grave, reverent look on his face. ' Please
God !' I heard him say, as though speaking to
himself. My ' Amen ' was inaudible.

I was obliged to leave him at last, and go
up to Virginia. As I passed the library, Mr.
Fleming came out. The library window commanded
a view of the avenue  perhaps he
had been watching us.

Well,' he said, looking at me with a smile,
is the Squire pleased with his ovation ?'

He seems rather upset by it all. I cannot
get him to look over the house, or to pay
attention to anything. Wee must leave him
quiet for this one day.'

His cup is filled to the brim  very little
would make it overflow. You are right ; we
must leave him to get used to his position.
I will go out to him, and tell him some Leeds
news  any triviality that comes into my head.'

I have been talking to him about Reggie's
frocks.' He laughed at that, and we parted.

I found Virginia lying back on her easy
chair, with her eyes closed, as though she, too,
were listening to the bells. She seemed utterly

exhausted, and there was a dark look round her
mouth ; but when she opened her eyes I almost
started. In place of their wild, haunted look
they had the happy restfulness of a child.

Cathy, dear Cathy ! do you hear the bells ?
They are ringing in Basil's honour  to welcome
my boy to his home. Good Mr. Leigh ! I
must thank him for this.'

You are happy, Virginia ?' I asked softly, as
I knelt down beside her, and looked into her
sweet pallid face.

Happy ! I am suffocated with happiness !'
putting her hands to her breast. ' Do you
know how I felt when he kissed me  the first
kiss I have ever had from my child ? As
though I could die with joy ! And when
he told me to oo and rest I felt then that I had

a son.'

He will be everything to you.'

He is nobleness itself. There was not a
word of reproach, and yet he owes all his
unhappiness to his mother. Did you see how
his face changed when he spoke of his wife ?
He is terribly unhappy.'

I fear he is.'

I do more than fear it ; I am sure of it.
There are lines in his face that tell their own
story. Cathy, I must confess something : There
was one moment when I shrank from him 

from my own boy  and that was when I saw
his likeness to Paul'

 I am afraid he noticed it.'

He shall never notice it again ; but for the
moment it was so strong. There was the
beautiful mouth and chin. Paul's were modelled
like a Greek god's. I shut my eyes for an
instant, and when I looked again it was still
there  the likeness  only the expression was
different ; there was no cruel sneer on Basil's
lips.'

No, indeed !'

I am glad he is not handsome ; there was
something diabolical in Paul's beauty. But his
hand !  there again I had a fresh pang. Do you
remember Paul's white, muscular hand and
filbert-shaped nails ? But, of course, you saw
him so little. Basil has his father's hand.'

You should not mind these things, Virginia.'
I do not ! I do not ! but for the moment I
was overcome. He is a grander man than
Paul ; and he carries his head like a king. To
think my little child has grown into that ! All
this time I have been trying to thank God ; but
my heart is too full for words.'

There are no words needed.'

No ; I just knelt upon the. ground, and said
nothing. But I think I never prayed so well.
Cathy, I cannot be surprised at anything today,

or I think Mr. Fleming would have
surprised me.'

Did you recognise him, Vi ?'  my old girlish
name for her.

Not in the least ; but when you mentioned
his name I said to myself : This is Catherine's
Mr. Fleming. How gray he has grown !' looking
at me a little curiously ; * but he is better
looking now than he used to be.'

I never thought of his looks.'

I dare say not. How fond you were of
each other in those old days ! Ah, my poor
father was cruel about that ! You were never
the same girl after Robert Fleming went away.
1 think no parent has a right to come between
two people who love each other.'

Perhaps not. 1 am of your opinion, Virginia;
but, if you please, we will not talk of that old,
old story. When you see him again you must
talk to him about Basil. He is his boy as well
as yours.'

Yes, I know ;' but I could see my words
pained her. She would be very jealous of
her son's love for others, I knew. I think
this made her a little cold in her praises
of Mr. Fleming. ' But he is a good man, and
we owe him a debt of gratitude,' she finished.
You must not let me be selfish, Cathy  if I
could only overcome this jealousy!  but I cannot

bear to think that he took my place all those
years.'

Poor Virginia ! After all, it was not pure
unalloyed happiness. The maternal instinct
that had so long been starved and thwarted
had to battle fiercely for its rights. Alas ! who
could give her back those lost years ? After
all, Basil was right when he decided that the
past must be consigned to oblivion : to her dying
day the mother's heart would cry out for the
little child she had never seen. I tried to persuade
Virginia to remain quietly In her room
that evening, but neither Marsden nor I could
Induce her to listen to reason. Her son should
not take his place at the head of the table unless
she were there to see it. I sent for Basil
at last, and at his first word she yielded.

Mother,' he said almost abruptly, ' it would
be impossible for me to eat my dinner if I saw
you sitting at the table and looking ready to
faint. If you will stay here quietly I will come
up and talk to you afterwards.'

But you will take your proper place,
Basil ?'

Not to-night. I shall sit by Aunt Catherine.
Why do we need this stiff formal dinner ? I
shall shock your servants : I have no dress-clothes.
I ordered them this morning ; but I
have only my morning coat.'

VOL. II.  ''J

Bennet will understand. He is such an old
servant. Catherine, remember tomorrow that
my son is to be consulted at what hour he
wishes to dine !'

My dear mother ' in a protesting

voice.

You are master here. Basil. No one shall
question your authority. Neither Catherine
nor I will obtrude ourselves, my dear,' taking
his hand timidly. ' Everything shall be as you
wish it.'

Your wishes will be mine, mother.'

Let us go now, Virginia, and Basil shall
come to you by-and-by. He has eaten nothing
since he has entered the house ;' and then she
said no more.

I was anxious to get him away. He was
looking nervous and uncomfortable acain. I
knew it pained him to see his mother so humble
and submissive. It seemed to put them both
in a false position. He spoke out this thought
as soon as the door closed behind us.

'Aunt Catherine, you must give my mother
a hint. I do not mean to put Aline in her place
or yours. We are circumstanced strangely. It
is not easy to define things. I will take my
place, but Aline is not fit for hers. You will
be just as much mistress here as ever. I don't
fancy my mother comprehends the situation.'

Perhaps not  nor, in truth, do I.'

Things will shape themselves,' he returned
in a melancholy voice, and then we entered the
dining-room.

I saw a look of surprise flit over Bennet's
face as Basil took the chair beside me, and Mr.
Fleming seated himself opposite to him. As
Reynolds handed the soup, I saw Basil look
round the room at the carved antique furniture,
the heavily-framed family portraits, the massive
flagons and drinking - cups on the sideboard.
The bells were still pealing, the rooks were
cawing over the tree-tops, the room was sweet
with roses and heliotrope, a great marble basket
of hot-house flowers was in the centre of the
table. I wonder why Basil looked at it all so
gravely ? Was he thinking of the bare pavilion ?
Of the cottage-room at Highgate ? Of those
midnight wanderings in Holloway ? Of the
parlour behind the shop ? And now of the goodly
heritage that was his ? As I looked at him
questioningly, a flash of his eyes answered me,
and then I knew I was right.

As soon as coffee had been served, Basil
went up to his mother's room, and I accompanied
him to look at Reggie, who was sleeping
in his father's room. I found he had taken
the cat to bed with him  a large snow-white
Persian, who went by the name of Peter. They

372

both looked so comfortable that I had not the
heart to disturb them.

The summer twilight had closed in, and on
my return to the drawing-room I found that
Reynolds had already lighted the hanging-lamp,
and the soft, warm light just irradiated the
centre of the room. Mr. Fleming was standing
under it with a book in his hand. At that
moment I was conscious of a strange shock, a
curious revulsion of feeling ; a scene out of the
long-closed past started up before me. Eight-and-twenty
years ago he had stood just in that
spot, when they had sent me in to bid him farewell
! The swinging lamp, with its pink shade,
was casting just the same glow over him, only
it was early spring, and the room was full of
warm firelight. Should I ever forget that
evening ? and how, when that miserable interview
was over, he put me from him when, in
my girlish passion, I would have clung to him ?

It is the will of God, Catherine,' he said
gently, and then he left me.

As these thoughts flashed through my mind,
Mr. Fleming raised his eyes and looked at me
fixedly. I knew then the same recollection had
occurred to him. He placed a chair for me,
and stood beside me a moment.

I can read your thoughts,' he said very
quietly. * You are remembering what neither

of US can ever forget. It is better to speak of
it frankly  it is useless to try and ignore it
Yes, it was here, in this room, that I passed
the bitterest moments of my life. When I
closed that door behind me I knew I was
closing it on my hopes of earthly happiness.'

I could not control my voice sufficiently
to answer him. He was standing just behind
me, and it seemed to me as though it
were the young Robert Fleming who was
speaking.

It took all my strength to give you up. I
remember you made it very hard for me to
leave you. Ah, well ! we are middle-aged
people now ; we can bear to look back on the
past pain. Time is a marvellous healer  Is it
not, Catherine ?'

Why have you never come to see me ?'
That question would rise to my lips in spite o
myself. ' ill these years your old friend has
been forgotten.'

You do not believe what you say,' he returned
calmly, as he took the seat beside me.
You have never been forgotten by me. No,
I have not come  that is true ; I had my
reasons. But, all the same, I have seen you
from time to time ; I have assured myself that
you were well and happy.'

Mr. Fleming ! what can you mean ?'

Forgive me if I do not answer you ; a man
must keep his own counsel sometimes. I have
not seen you for years ; the last time, I think,
it was at St. Mark's.'

'You knew me! you recognised me!' but I
was too much abashed to say any more. I felt
myself blush like a girl  I, the middle-aged
woman !

I should know you anywhere ;' and there
was unmistakable tenderness in his voice.

I preached well that night ; I felt inspired,
lifted out of myself, to know you were there
listening to me. I wanted to speak to you, to
tell you how grateful I was, but v/hen 1 came
into the church you had gone.'

You could not be sure it was I,' I stammered.

I had a thick veil.'

'If I had needed proof, it was given me.
Do you remember this ?'

He took out of his pocket a tiny prayer-book
that looked very much the worse for wear ; it
was bound in Russian leather, and on the fly-leaf
was written ' Catherine Seton.'

Why did you keep this ?' 1 asked, as he
took it out of my hand.

Could I embarrass you by returning it ?'
was the answer ; but I knew he was not
telling me the real reason. I saw that by
the conscious look on his face. ' 1 have had

it SO long that I may as well keep it ;' and
he put it back in his pocket with a fine air of
indifference.

Your visit cheered me immensely,' he went
on. * I knew then that I had a friend and
well-wisher as well as St. Mark's ;' and as I
started and again a painful flush suffused my
face, he said very earnestly : ' Do you think I
did not recognise our Lady Bountiful ?  that I
did not bless you in my heart as I expended
those generous sums of money ? If you only
knew what a happiness it has been to act as
your almoner ! I felt then as though you and
I were still working together.'

You and I ! Oh, how cautious he was ! But
he had called me Catherine once.

But, all the same, you never cared to come
and see me.'

 I thought it better not '  in a low voice.
Sometimes I used to wonder that you never
married. Do you know you have refused a
friend of mine  Beauchamp ? But he comforted
himself by taking a wife some ten years
ago. I remember his coming to me, and telling
me of his disappointment. He was a capital
fellow.'

You have not married, either.'

I have never cared to do so ;' but I fancy
he looked reproachfully at me, as though I

might have left that unsaid. ' I had Basil, you
see; I made him my chief interest in life.'

You must have been lonely when he left
you.'

Yes, I was pretty lonely ; I had got so used
to him, I could tell the lad anything. It was a
bad business for me when his wife manifested
that strange jealousy of his friends  it separated
us entirely : Basil begged me to keep away.
If I had had any idea of the real cause of his
misery I would not have obeyed him, but I
never knew until a few weeks ago.'

 It was wrong of Basil not to tell you.'

He could not bear for me to know ; but, of
course, it was a mistake. Never mind, I am
not his only friend now : he has you and his
mother to stand by him.'

We talked a little more on this subject 
about Basil's meeting with his mother. He
wanted to hear all about it ; and when I had
satisfied him, he said quietly :

Never mind Basil now ; you have told me
all I wished to know ; I shall hear the rest from
himself. I want to know something on another
subject. Will you tell me about yourself, and
your sister, and the life you have led all these
years ? You do not know how much it will
interest me.'

This was said so simply and kindly, and with

such an air of friendliness, that my troubled
consciousness was soothed at once. The next
minute I found myself talking to him as though
he were my brother ; and there was so much to
tell  the tragedy of Virginia's home-coming 
her despair and remorse  my father's death 
and our solitary life in the old Hall. I described
Virginia's strange seclusion  her morbid
fits  the grief that threatened to prey upon her
life. He looked at me anxiously.

I had no idea of this  at least, I had not
realized it ; it must have tried you sadly  such
a life !'

I would not let it try me,' I returned
quickly, for I did not wish him to pity me too
much. It had been in his power to help me,
and his foolish man's pride had kept him away.
After all, men, even the best of them, are such
cowards. ' I had plenty of work : I had Basil's
property to manage ; I became a woman of
business ; sometimes I went into society ; now
and then I entertained at the Hall  but that
was dreary work without Virginia. By-and-by
I had Olga to help me ; I never felt dull when
that dear child was with me.'

Olga ?  that is the young lady with the
pretty voice. Yes, I liked the look of her ; she
has a sweet face.'

Her nature is sweeter still ; everyone loves

Olga ;' and then I stopped, for at that moment
Basil came into the room.

He looked surprised to see me there.

It is very late ; I thought you would have
retired long ago, Aunt Catherine. I was
obliged to remind my mother of the time.
What a long day it has been !' rather wearily.
I think I must bid you good-night now.'

You are very tired, Basil !'

He gave me a queer glance.

I think this day has been three days rolled
in one  it has seemed endless. I suppose if we
measured time by our feelings, I should have
lived a month since I got up this morning.
Good-night, Aunt Catherine ;' and then, for the
first time, he kissed me  he seemed to do it
naturally.

Poor lad ! he is quite worn out,' observed
Mr. Fleming. ' People who do not know Basil
would not give him credit for such deep feelings
; but you and I know him better.'

'Yes, indeed. Good-night, Mr. Fleming.'

'Good-night'  and, detaining me a moment :
Thank you for all you have told me this
evening ; after all, we are old friends,
Catherine.'

I hope so.'

'And friends for life, too. Some folk think
very highly of friendship ; but you and I are

different sort of people. All these years I have
called you my friend.'

I am glad of that,' I returned soberly.

When I entered my room, with the candle
still in my hand, I walked up to the pier-glass
and gravely regarded myself from head to
foot.

What did I see ? A quiet, well-preserved
gentlewoman, in a gray satin dress, with a
figure that had not yet lost its girlish roundness,
and brown hair, with here and there a
thread of shining silver.

So this is Robert Fleming's friend,' I said
to myself 'his friend for life.'

But as I looked a sudden mist seemed to
obscure the view ; and as I turned away a great
cloud of sadness seemed to envelop me, for I
knew that I could not strip myself of my riches,
and that they, and they alone, divided me from
the tenderest and most faithful heart that ever
beat in this world !

THEY ASKED FOR THE SQUIRE.

You are shy and proud, like Englishmen.'

Tennyson.

God's goodness has been great to thee ;
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
But still remember what the Lord hath done.'

Stolid Part of' Henry VI'

Just then there was a knock at the door, and
Marsden entered ; the honest creature had come
to unburden her heart of a Httle of its gladness.
She was warmly attached to her mistress ; with
the exception of myself, no one understood Virginia
so well. I used to marvel at her patience
when Virginia was in one of her trying moods.
This is a happy day, ma'am,' she began ; ' I
never thought to see my mistress look as she
does to-day. I could cry as I think of it, and
of our fine young Squire who has come to his
own.'

I was sure of your sympathy with us, Mars-den.
I have been talking to Mrs. Larkins and
Bennet, and they both say how pleased all the
servants seem with the look of their new master.
My sister has reason to be proud of such a
son.'

Oh, poor thing ! and she is proud ! She will
just lie awake until morning thinking of him,
and how he is sleeping under her roof to-night.
It has been a trial for him, poor young gentleman
! I will not deny that, meeting his mother
for the first time as a full-grown man ; but no
one could have behaved better. '* He has been
goodness itself to me"  that was what she said
to me just now.'

Marsden, I want to ask you something, and
there has been no opportunity. How did my
sister take the news ?'

Do you mean when your letter came, ma'am,
two days ago ? Well, I was in my mistress's
room, just attending to the flowers. I had
given her the letter, and was thinking no more
about it, when she suddenly called out, and I
thought she was going to faint. One hears
sometimes of folks who have died from a
sudden joy that was too much for them, and
I seemed to understand it when I looked at my
mistress's white face.'

Oh no !' I exclaimed, shocked at the bare

idea ; ' I had prepared her so carefully in the
previous letter.'

All the same, it was too much for her. She
seemed as though she were paralyzed at first ;
her poor hands shook so she could not hold the
paper. I had to read the letter to her from
beginning to end, and when I had finished she
made me begin all over again ; it did not seem
as though she could take it in.'

I wished afterwards that I had asked you to
telegraph to St. Croix ; I so dreaded the effect
on her.'

'Well, after a bit she got calmer, and I
gave her her composing-draught ; and then
she begged me to leave her alone for an
hour. I was almost afraid to do it, seeing her
so weak and upset ; but she was very peremptory
with me. I stood at the door for the
best part of the time, and it was hardly on
the stroke of the hour when I went back to her;
and what do you think were her first words,
ma'am ?' and now there was a broad smile on
Marsden's face.

It is no use my trying to guess, Marsden.'

No, ma'am ; and I assure you I could
hardly believe my ears : ** What am I to wear,
Marsden, when I receive my son ?" and looking
at me as anxious, too, as though the three
kingdoms depended on my answer.'

How unlike Virginia !' I murmured.

It was the first time I ever heard such a
speech from my mistress's hips, and I have
Heed close upon four-and-twenty years with her;
and it put me in a nice pucker. There was
only that old black velvet that had been put
away in lavender for the last twelve years, and
Wollaston and I had a world of trouble remodelling
it and making it ht to wear.' Wollaston was
our upper housemaid, who had always acted
as my maid, for I was too independent in my
habits to need a maid of my own.

It really looked very well.'

It did at a pinch ; but my mistress, bless
her dear heart ! grumbled a good deal over it.
This is really what I have come to consult you
about ; for last night my mistress said to me,
"You must renovate py wardrobe. I must have
some handsome dresses ; I do not wish my son
to be ashamed of his mother's appearance. You
and my sister can talk over it, and then you can
get me anything you and she think will be suitable."
It was a bit vague, was it not, ma'am ?
but, there ! my mistress is as impracticable in
such matters as a child.'

Never mind, Marsden ; you and I will put
our heads together. Let me see, if you will
come to my room half an hour before luncheon
tomorrow we will arrange it. There must bea

new velvet dress ; I have made up my mind
to that already  Mr. Basil has a fancy for
velvet ; and then, perhaps, a satin, and a rich
black silk with jet trimmings  we will settle all
that later on. I shall probably go to town ina
day or two, and can call on the dressmaker 
Hobart Place is only a step from Victoria.'

That will be best. Now I must not keep
you up any longer, ma'am,' and Marsden withdrew
with a satisfied expression on her comely
face.

The next morning, as I was finishing dressing,
I heard Nix bark, and, looking out of my
window, I saw Reggie, in his white sailor suit,
running down one of the garden paths, with the
pug waddling after him. The next moment the
window next mine was thrown up, and  Wait forme,
old chap !' followed in Basil's voice. Reggie
stopped at once, and planted his legs sturdily, as
though nothing would induce him to move,
while Nix ambled round him, heaving his fat
lite body and jingling his bells, with his foolish
little tail curled up tightly after the manner of
well-bred pugs.

I stood watching them until Basil came out of
the house. The gray suit and little gray cap
reminded me of La Maisonnette and the
pavilion. It was always a pretty sight to see
Reggie with his father. I like the way in which

Basil snatched him up, and, thinking himself unperceived,
kissed him again and again before he
hoisted him on his shoulder and marched off
with him. They were going to see the peacocks,
and the honeysuckle arbour, and Reggie's new
garden. I knew how Basil would enjoy showing
him all the sights. I am sorry to say that
Reggie spoke of the peacocks in the most disrespectful
way afterwards:

Them ridiculous birds, what has trains like
ladies,' he observed.

Basil seemed in excellent spirits at breakfast-time,
and when afterwards I volunteered to show
him the house, he consented on the condition
that Reggie came too. This impeded our movements
a little, as Reggie, who had developed a
strong attachment to Peter, insisted on toiling
after us with the huge creature tucked under his
arm, until he was red in the face. I am not
quite sure that Peter liked it  he was a cat of
dignity ; he escaped just as we were entering
the Lady Gwendoline's Room, as it was still
called ; and I saw him licking himself on the
window-seat in rather an irritable and injured
manner.

Do you think Aline would like this room ?
I asked presently ; 'it is a very pleasant room,
and with a little fresh cretonne, and a comfortable
chair or two, it would make quite a pretty

VOL. II. 38

boudoir. And it is so quiet, too; your apartments
would be quite shut off from the rest of the
house.'

Where would Reggie sleep?' he asked rather
anxiously. ' The nursery is too far away ; I
must have him near me.'

He could sleep in your dressing-room, if
you like ; there is plenty of space. Yes,
perhaps that is best. But, Basil, yon have not
answered me yet. Do you think Aline will like
this room ?'

She would be hard to please if she did not.
It is a very handsome room ; those carved
cabinets are beautiful. Has no one ever used it ?'

Not in my time. Virginia always preferred
a front room, and hitherto I have sat in the
library. I have always had so much writing todo,
and it was more convenient for the tenants
and servants ; but, of course, that will be your
room now.'

But why need I banish you ?' with a tinge of
impatience in his tone ; * the library would hold
a dozen people comfortably. Look here. Aunt
Catherine, if I am to be master, I mean you to
be mistress. You have got to coach me up in
my duties, so we may as well begin to work together
from the first.'

But, my dear '

There is no *' but " in the matter. I intend

to keep things as much as possible on their
former footing. I suppose AHne must sit at the
top of her own table ; but I don't mean to make
any other change. You talked a lot of rubbish
at St. Croix about the Dower House, as you
called it  as though I should allow my mother,
in her delicate state of health, to go into that
mouldy, fusty, disused wing. Why, the whole
place smelt like a vault !'

It has been so long shut up,' I returned 
ever since my grandmother's time. She and
her two daughters inhabited that wing when my
father married ; I showed you their portraits in
the billiard-room ; they were your great-aunts,
Alicia and Penelope. Of course, it must be
thoroughly aired, and a great deal of painting
and whitewashing will be necessary before the
rooms can be used.'

Perhaps so ; but, as I do not intend to have
them used, we may leave all that alone. My
mother will remain in her own comfortable
apartments ; and as for you, if you are too
proud or too unsociable to share the library
with me, you might take possession of that
pretty little morning-room downstairs;' and he so
evidently meant what he said, and was so benton
his own way, that I dared not say another
word ; and, after all, the Lady Gwendoline's
Room was most fit for Mrs. Basil Lyndhurst.

Reynolds came up just then, to tell us that
Miss Olga and the two Mr. Leighs were
talking to Mr. Fleming in the drawing-room.
They asked for the Squire, and for you,
ma'am.'

Basil coloured a little, perhaps at the word
Squire.'

We must not keep our first visitors waiting,
must we. Aunt Catherine ?' he said, and hurried
me downstairs.

I knew how kindly Mr. Leigh would greet
Basil  he had such a good heart! He wrung
my hand in quite a feeling way as he congratulated
me. ' I never was so surprised in my
life,* he said ; 'and I need not tell you how glad
I am, both for you and Mrs. Lyndhurst !' and
actually his spectacles were so moist that he
had to take them off to wipe them. I am
sure he shook hands three times with Basil.
His own regret seemed to be that his wife had
not been able to come with him that morning.

Jem, too, behaved very well. He was a little
grave, perhaps a trifle distant, in his manner to
Basil ; but he was quite his old affectionate self
with me ; only he persisted in calling me Miss
Seton.

But, Jem,' I protested, * I like Aunt
Catherine ever so much better.'

I cannot help that,' with an accession of

gravity ; ' it would not be good taste now, when
you have a real nephew.'

But Basil will not mind.'

I should not think of asking him,' rather
stiffly. ' I have been talking to Olga, and
begging her to give it up too ; but girls are so
self-opinionated ; she won't hear of calling you
Miss Seton.'

I should think not !' indignantly. ' Olga is
the last one to hurt my feelings.'

Do you mean that you will be hurt ?' and it
was evident Jem's soft heart was relenting ;
unfortunately, at that moment Basil called me.

Aunt Catherine, are we engaged for
Saturday ? is that the day we are going up to
town ? Mr. Leigh wants us to dine with him.'

I saw directly that Basil wished to accept
the invitation, so I told him Monday would do
very nicely for our expedition. Jem caught at
my arm.

Don't you understand how ridiculous it would
be for me ?' he said in a low voice ; ' perhaps it
does not matter for Olga ; but for me '

Well  well, do as you like, my dear.'
But I was just a trifle hurt with Jem. He
need not have made the difference in such a
hurry. It looked  it certainly looked as though
he were jealous of Basil. So, though he said a
great many nice things to me, and made the

THE SEARCH FOR BASIL LYNDHURST

most friendly overtures to Reggie  whom he
pronounced a 'jolly little chap'  I somehow
felt as though Jem were not quite a success. I.
hinted at this to Olga, when all the gentlemen
had betaken themselves to the stables  a part
of the establishment Basil had not yet visited.
We were waiting for Marsden, who had not yet
finished dressing her mistress. Virginia's sleepless
night had prevented her rising at her usual
time. I thought Olga looked rather uncomfortable
as I spoke.

I am sure he is prejudiced against Basil.'

Oh, I hope not ! I trust not !' looking quite
pained at the idea ; ' but Jem, dear old fellow !
has his peculiarities. He is a regular Briton,
Aunt Catherine. He prides himself upon
always being straightforward and above-board,
as he calls it, and, as you know, he does so hate
mysteries.'

That is so foolish of Jem.'

He will have it Mr. Basil is mysterious.
You know how Jem will ask questions. I am
sure he must have asked me at least five
hundred last night ! he will say over and over
again that Mr. Basil ought to have told us about
his wife from the very first. '' By your own account
you took him for a widower," he said
very severely ; '' well, no fellow has any right tolet
a woman think that of him." It was very

tiresome and wrong of Jem, and great nonsense
too, for of course he gave us no right to suppose
such a thing ; and why need he tell his
family affairs to strangers ?'

I am glad you defended him, Olga.'

Of course I defended him. 1 got quite
angry with Jem at last. Hubert and Kitty
were far nicer, as I told him. Oh, Aunt
Catherine, I am sure you will be shocked when
you see Kitty!'

Is she so unwell ?'

She is more than that; she looks absolutely
ill, and she has grown much thinner. Hubert
does not see it a bit ; when I spoke to him, he
only said the heat had tired her, and that it
was a mistake their going to Lowestoft ; the
place had not suited her.'

Poor little woman ! I must try and find time
to see her this afternoon.'

Oh, she sent you a message. I was to tell
you how rejoiced she was to hear about Mr.
Basil ; she really cried when she talked about it,
and she was so pleased to see me, and so were the
children. I have only just come home in time
to see Hugh. Hubert takes him to school tomorrow.'


And the twins, and Wilfred, and little
Florence ?'

Oh, they are all as well as possible ! Mab

has certainly grown, and looks so pretty. Do
you know, though I had got them all round me,
I missed Reggie. Oh, here comes Marsden
at last, and I must leave you to your business
!'

I could not prevail on Olga to stay to
luncheon.

Kitty was not well enough to be left, she
said ; and she knew Hubert and Jem would
both like to remain.

I think the stables had thawed Jem ; he was
far more conversational on his return. Basil
seemed to like him ; but I noticed neither of
them mentioned Oxford. After luncheon Jem
started for a long walk with Mr. Fleming,
Basil went up to sit with his mother, and Mr.
Leigh took me across to Fircroft. I found
Mrs. Leigh lying on a couch at the open
window in the drawing-room. Olga was sitting
by her, working. She certainly looked very
weak and fragile. I noticed her cheek-bones
were slightly prominent, and her eyes were
larger and brighter. She was always a pretty
little woman, though of late years she had had
a worn, faded look. She greeted me most
affectionately, and made me sit down beside
her.

I am so glad, dear Miss Seton !' she
whispered.

Her husband, who had not heard the whisper,
interrupted her.

Kitty has grown very lazy,' he said, in his
cheerful way ;  she makes us all wait on her.
I am head-nurse, and Mab and Jessie carry out
my orders.'

Hubert is right ; I give them a great deal
of trouble,' she returned rather sadly ; and it
struck me at once that she was depressed about
herself.

Mr. Leigh had some parish work, and left us
almost immediately ; and a few minutes afterwards
Harry Vivian came up to the window
and challenged Olga to a game of tennis.
Harry was a great favourite of mine ; we all
called him Harry ; and, indeed, who could help
liking such a bright, cheery young fellow ?
Long ago I had guessed the poor boy's secret,
though I never mentioned the subject to Olga.
If he had only been half a dozen years older 
but he would never be on the same plane with
her : he was only a good-looking boy, and Olga
was a woman. I thought she put down her
work a little reluctantly ; she would rather have
stayed with us.

I am out of practice,' she remarked ; ' but I
will try one game, if you like. But I mean to
walk back with Aunt Catherine.'

Mrs. Leigh looked after them.

We are all so glad to get Olga back,' she
said presently ; ' the poor children have missed
her so. Do you know, Hubert and I think she
looks different, somehow. She is quieter. I
noticed it last night, and put it down to the
score of fatigue ; but to-day she is even quieter.
She is generally so full of spirits.*

I think Jem was a little bit tiresome last
night.'

Do you mean about your nephew ? I am
afraid we none of us spared Olga. She was
very good in answering all our questions. She
has grown very pretty ; Hubert said so last
night'

I always thought Olga pretty.'

Well, not exactly ; It Is more her expression,'
returned Mrs. Leigh. ' Her features are not at
all regular ; but until last night I never thought
her the least pretty.'

Well, perhaps not. After all, pretty would
apply to a doll. There Is something better
than mere prettiness in Olga's face.'

I often wonder if she will marry,' she
continued thoughtfully. ' I think she will.
Hubert and I talk of it sometimes.'

Of course she will marry !' quite indignantly;
for the Idea of my sweet Olga being an old
maid was repellent to me. What, was she to
go through life and never meet her other self ?

She has never Heed anyone yet ; I am sure
of that. Olga is not Hke other girls. She
would ask a oreat deal from the man she
loved.'

As she spoke an odd thought flashed
through me  a curiously painful thought. If
Basil had been free, would he have cared for
Olga ? Would Olga have cared for him ? I
changed the subject hastily by questioning Mrs.
Leigh about her health.

If I were you,' I said seriously, ' I would
consult a physician. Dr. Langham is very
clever ; but it is always more satisfactory to
have a second opinion.'

I wish you would tell Hubert so,' she
returned anxiously ; he thinks so much of
what you say. I have never liked to propose it
to him, for fear of frightening him. I am
certainly not gaining ground this summer.'

I wonder Mr. Leigh does not see that
for himself.'

Oh no ! He will have it that it is only
Lowestoft, and I shall soon get stronger. He
was quite angry one day when I told him that I
felt much weaker. He thinks it is my fancy' 
and now there were tears in her eyes  'and
that I do not make sufficient effort. I went
out to pay some calls with him last week, and
when I got home I fainted.'

Mrs. Leigh, you must certainly speak to a
physician at once. It would be the truest kindness
to your husband ; never mind if he thinks
you fanciful.'

I believe you are right. I wish I were not
so cowardly with Hubert. I do so hate worrying
him. If you knew how good he is to me !'

I think everyone knows Mr. Leigh's devotion
to his wife.'

She blushed very prettily.

If I could only be well enough to help him
as I used ! it is such a trial having to lie here
and do nothing. That is why I am so glad
Olga has come back, because he will miss me
less. She has always been such a comfort to us.'

We had a little more talk, and before I left
Mrs. Leigh promised that she would ask her
husband to take her up to London. I was not
at all easy in my mind about her ; her mother
had died of decline, and one or two of her
aunts. There was a wasted look about her, and
her hand was so thin and light that it gave mea
shock to touch it. Olga had finished her
game, and she joined me at once. Her first
question was about her sister-in-law  did I
not think she looked ill ?

Very ill,' was my reply ; and then I told her
the piece of advice I had given. She seemed
relieved to hear it.

She shall go at once ; that is a good idea,
Aunt Catherine. I wish Kitty were not so
afraid of telling Hubert things. In my opinion,
husbands and wives ought to be perfectly
frank with each other ; but I dare say you will
tell me I am not a good judge '  with a little
laugh. ' But, then, Hubert is such a slow, stupid,
dear old fellow ; he never notices things like
other people.'

I don't know that,' was my unlucky response,
but I repented the words as soon as I
had spoken them. * He told Mrs. Leigh that
you were somehow different, and so much
quieter, and she said the same.'

Oh no, Aunt Catherine  not really,' in a
tone of such distress that I looked at her in
surprise. She was quite pale, and her lips
were quivering, but she turned off her emotion
with a laugh. ' Why, what nonsense ! As
though a person were never to be tired 
and Jem so harassing too ! I  I do not think
I will come any farther. Aunt Catherine ; it
would be a pity to interrupt them  would it
not ?'

We were just by our gate as she spoke, and
two people were coming slowly towards us. It
was Virginia in her lace hood, pacing under the
elms, supported by Basil's arm. Reggie was
running on before them.

How happy they look !' whispered Olga, as
she left me.

But I did not answer her ; I was too much
absorbed in that picture. Could I have ever
hoped to have seen that sight ? Virginia was
walking feebly, but her face was upturned.
Basil was bending down to speak to her. I
was almost sorry that Reggie saw me and
pounced on me with a shout.

I have brought my mother out into the sunshine
; there is no tonic like fresh air, I tell her.'
Basil still spoke with a sort of shyness and
constraint, with something of formality, but the
slight bashfulness sat well on him. * Are you
tired ?'  looking down at her.

No, my dear  no ; you have such a strong
arm, and it seems to support me so ;' and then
I took Reggie's hand and walked beside them,
until the gong summoned us to the house.

CHAPTER XVI.

so YOU HAVE COME BACK !'

Why, what's the matter,
That you have such a February face.
So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?'

jlfuc/i Ado about Nothings

Shy she was, and I thought her cold.'

Tennyson.

Mr. Fleming left us the next morning. I did
not see him alone again, and our few parting
words were exchanged in Virginia's presence.
I thought he looked very grave, but he said he
should soon see us again, as Basil had made
him promise to pay us another flying visit early
in November. I missed him sadly that evening
; somehow, I felt sure that, as he sat in his
lonely room that night, he was missing us too !
We dined at Fircroft on Saturday. On
looking back on that evening, I am not
quite sure that I regarded it as a success.

Basil was not perfectly at his ease. He
looked very handsome in evening dress, but
he showed his nervousness by being a little
stiff. Olga, too, was unusually quiet ; it struck
me that Jem was keeping vigilant watch
over her, and that she was aware of his surveillance.
She seemed half afraid to talk to
Basil, and her manner showed none of that
soft friendliness that was natural to her. Perhaps
Basil missed it, for I saw him looking at her
once or twice in a puzzled way. Mrs. Leigh
had made an effort, and took her usual seat at
the dinner-table ; I thought she looked far more
fit for bed. Her husband seemed overjoyed to
see her there.

Why, this is like old times, Kitty !' he said ;
and all through dinner I coukl see him at
intervals beaming on her through his spectacles.

I never saw a man more devoted to any
woman. Mrs. Leigh's worn, sensitive face
brightened into positive beauty as she caught
one of these fond looks.

She is picking up nicely now,' he said to mein
a confidential whisper. 'It is a case of
nerves. Kitty was always too finely strung.
If she would only make an effort and pull herself
together, she would get on.'

Poor Mr. Leigh ! I had not the heart to
undeceive him. Olga, who had overheard this

little speech, looked at me and shrugged her
shoulders rather sadly. We were not a very-lively
party ; I think the young men were a
little overawed by Basil's stiffness, which most
likely they mistook for haughtiness. I was not
surprised on our return to hear Basil say that
he had not enjoyed himself much. He liked
Mr. Leigh exceedingly, and Mrs. Leigh also.

What a pretty little woman she would be,' he
said, ' if she were not quite so thin and unsub-
statical-looking ! And 1 like that nice-looking
fellow, Vivian ; the other two men are sticks.'

And Jem ?'

Oh, Jem is a bit stand-offish. I don't know
quite what to make of him. He seems a nice
fellow enough, but he keeps his sister too much
in order.'

He is devoted to her, really.'

Oh yes, I dare say. Shall I light your candle
for you, Aunt Catherine ? What a pretty dress
that is ! You cut them all out this evening.'

But though he smiled in his old manner ashe
paid me that little compliment, I could see
Basil was not in his usual spirits.

Sunday was better. Basil and Reggie and I
went to church in the morning, and I felt very
happy and grateful. I was sure from Basil's
earnest, devout manner that he was grateful too.

After evening service we took Olga back

VOL. Ti. 39

with us. Jem was not at church, and after
supper she sang to us all our favourite hymns.
Basil was still a little quiet, but Olga seemed
more like herself, and the evening passed very
pleasantly.

The next morning we took an early train upto
town. Basil had to Interview his tailor and
boot maker, and I spent a couple of hours In a
quiet street leading out of Eaton Square discussing
materials and fashions with our dressmaker,
Miss Estrange. I am quite sure that
I never took such interest in my own dresses
as I did in Virginia's, and as Miss Estrange
was quite as Interested, I felt we had done a
good morning's work when I had finished.

It was nearly two o'clock when Basil and I
met for a hasty luncheon. He complained that
he had not done half his business, and that he
should have to run up to town again In a day or
two. He seemed tired and worn, and gave me
such curt answers that I left off questioning him.
I knew the approaching interview with his wife
was making him gloomy.

There was no time to be lost. So we jumped
into a hansom, and drove as quickly as possible
to King's Cross. Basil's tongue did not
unloose until we were In the train, and then he
said rather quickly :

I do hate myself for being such a coward !

If I had not been such a fool, you might have
been sitting comfortably in the library at this
present moment.'

But I prefer to be where I am, thank you.'

Oh, you say that just to make me feel better
about things. Of course you never think of
yourself, but, all the same, I ought to have
thought for you. Why need I have brought
you to such a place ?' with an air of intense disgust.
' You have never been used to it. I
ought to have remembered that.'

Nonsense,' I returned, laughing. ' I have
been in much worse places. Don't trouble
about my feelings, Basil ; I am only thinking
how I can best help you. I want Aline to
look on me as her friend. That is why I have
come with you  that she may know how ready
we are to welcome her.'

But as Basil said no more, and only looked
excessively gloomy, I thought it better to be
silent too ; for there are some moods of unhappy
self-consciousness when even the faintest touch
of sympathy seems to bruise.

In a few minutes we were walking down the
Holloway Road. Basil said we had only a few
hundred yards to go. He stalked by my side
like the knight of the rueful countenance. I
felt rather nervous and depressed myself I
could not help thinking of the weary months

392

our poor boy had spent among these humble
surroundings, and of the miles of pavement his
restless feet had traversed night after night.

This is the place,' he said, so abruptly that I
started. Before us was a little corner shop,
with a fine display of flowery Pekoe and fragrant
Bohea in one window, and heaps of plums and
currants, ornamented with citron and candied
fruits, in the other, and ' George Barton ' in gilt
letters over the door.

There where no customers in the shop, only a
small sandy-haired man, with a shrewd, comical
sort of face, looking over a ledger in the little
desk. I guessed this was Mr. Barton before
Basil went up to him and held out his hand.

Are you surprised to see me, George ?'

Well, I am a bit,' looking at me rather curiously.
' Allie never told me she expected you.
She is in there jerking his head in the direction
of the parlour. ' When did you get back,
Fleming ?'

'When did I arrive in England, do you
mean ? Last Tuesday ; but I couldn't come
before  I couldn't really, George,' in a deprecating
voice as Mr. Barton looked at him
rather sharply. ' I have a lot to tell you 
and Aline ; we had better go inside. You will
be wondering whom I have brought with me.
This is my aunt, Miss Seton.'

The little man ducked to me.

'Your servant, ma'am,' he said civilly; 'I
had no idea Fleming had a relative in the
world. Go to Allie, there's a good chap, and
ril join you as soon as Smith can take my
place  he is only changing a cheque for me 
and then you can tell us all your news.'

He spoke so heartily and kindly that he prepossessed
me in his favour ; but oh, my poor
boy ! no wonder you ran away from it all.

Come along, Aunt Catherine observed
Basil in a low voice, and I followed him into
a neat, cheerful little parlour.

Even in that instantaneous glance I saw
there were plants in the window, and some
nicely-arranged flowers on the small round
table. A great black cat was sleeping in a
cushioned chair ; and someone  Aline, of
course  was busy over some white work by
the open window. She dropped it as we
entered, and looked at us in extreme surprise
as she rose ; and, good heavens ! what a
beautiful face !

So you have come back, Basil !' she said
coldly, and without taking any notice of mei
think you might have written to tell us
when to expect you.'

I wanted to surprise you,' he said, with an
attempt at playfulness as he kissed her.

I noticed she turned her cheek to him and
received his caress reluctantly.

What a grand-looking woman ! I thought of
Basil's idyllic description of her in the harvest-field,
when she had first taken his fancy ; and I
could not but own that many a man might have
lost his heart to her.

She looked older than I expected  older
than Basil  and her fissure was larre and
matronly ; but the small classical head, with
its smooth glossy plaits, was just as he described
it to me, and so was the pure, clearly-cut
profile. The arose, dark eyes had a strange
penetrating sadness in them ; only the chin and
jaw was a little heavy and sullen-looking.

Basil did not seem to notice his chilling reception
; perhaps he was too well used toit.


Don't you wonder who this lady is, Aline ?'
he asked, with a sort of forced friendliness. * I
am going to give you and George another surprise.
I have found some relatives, and this is
one of them, my Aunt Catherine  Miss Seton,
I mean.'

And I have come with Basil to be introduced
to his wife,' I interposed hurriedly. ' My
dear, I hope you and I will be very good friends
in the future.'

But though I took her hand and pressed it

kindly she made no sort of response ; only a
hard look came over her face.

I suppose Basil has told you so much about
me that you are anxious to make my acquaintance,'
she said, with a sort of veiled sarcasm.
And then, with a complete change of manner,
and dropping my hand, ' Where's Reggie,
Basil ?'

'He is at the Hall  I mean, I haven't
brought him. I thought 'rather awkwardly
' you would come and see him instead.'

You haven't brought 'him i'  and now there
was a stormy light in her eyes. ' You have
kept him away from me all this time, and now
you have left him behind ! That is the way
you always treat me ! But of course Reggie
is nothing to me.'

Come, come ; you aren't quarrelling with
your chap already, are you, Allie ?' observed
her brother, who had overheard her last words.
Fleming says he has a lot to tell us ; most
likely he has some object in leaving the kid
behind. You see,' turning to us, and rubbing
his hands apologetically, ' Allie has been
missing him pretty badly all this time ; it is
natural she should have a mother's feelings.
I think the better of her for that, so we
won't blame her. Give the lady a seat, Fleming,
and take one yourself. Allie will be right

enough when she knows what you have got to

tell her.'

But, as though to contradict this soothing
statement, Aline resumed her work without
putting another question, leaving Basil to begin
his story as best he could. But I saw she
listened to every word ; and as he mentioned
his mother she drew a long breath and looked
up at him. He intercepted the glance at
once.

Are you glad I have found my mother,
Aline ?' he asked gently.

I don't know ; 1 haven't seen her yet ' 
evasively.

But you might be glad, for my sake,' he
persisted ; but as she made no answer he went
on with his story.

I saw her start and chancre colour when he

o

mentioned Reggie's illness, though he passed
over it very highly ; but she did not interrupt
him once, though Mr. Barton kept up a running
commentary in a sort of crescendo, which became
more shrill as Basil described his home.

Well, I am jiggered !' was his observation at
this point.

I felt the expression needed translation
to render it intelligible, and he rubbed up
his sandy hair until it seemed to bride. Mr.
Barton's excitement seemed to communicate itself

to Aline  she looked less statue-like. After
a moment she laid down her work.

Are squires very rich, Basil ?'

I don't know, my dear,' evidently delighted
to find she would speak to him. ' I cannot
answer for other squires, but Aunt Catherine
tells me I have a large fortune.'

Oh ! you will be happy then,' she said, still
looking at him. ' Our poor life has never
suited you ; you have not been brought up to it,
as George and I have. You will get on better
with your fine friends.'

Why, you talk as though I were going to
leave you behind ! only I know you don't mean
it. Aline, you should just see Reggie feeding
the peacocks  it is quite a picture ! Aunt
Catherine is going to order him a velvet suit ;
just fancy how he will look running over the
lawns and pulling the flowers !'

She seemed to listen to him breathlessly  her
lips parted  her eyes softened.

And there is such a beautiful room for you,
Aline  they call it the Lady Gwendoline's
Room  full of such lovely things ; and I shall be
able to buy you all you want  silk dresses,
furs, lace, anything you fancy  and my mother
is keeping some jewellery for you : you were
always fond of pretty things.

But I am not thinking of them now,' arching

her long neck with a gesture of disdain, and
looking handsomer than ever. * I am not a
child to be bribed into good behaviour by-pretty
things ; the question is '  and here her
voice faltered  ' wouldn't you rather have me
stop here along with George, than be shaming
you before your fine friends ?'

There was no mistaking the anxiety with
which she waited for his answer.

 Why should you shame me ?' he returned
impatiently. ' Why should we not begin allover
again ? We have made a mess of thrills
1 will not deny that. I have not been the
best of husbands to you. Aline ; and there have
been times when you have forgotten yourself.
But if you will only make a fresh start. I am
willing to overlook the past ; a man cannot say
more than that.'

Poor Basil I he meant well ; but if he had
only been a little softer with her ! But I suppose
he could not help his stern manner.

I am sure Fleming  I beg his pardon,
Lyndhurst  is speaking fair and proper, Allie ;
and there is no call for you to be so stand-fish
with him. You are his wife : remember
that.'

I am not likely to forget it. George,' she
returned, with a proud sort of humility. ' No,
you cannot sav more than that, Basil ; I did

not expect to hear you say so much, after the
way I have behaved. If you mean what you
say, and you are willing to have me to live

with you But there,' interrupting herself,

I will make no promises  I have broken too
many already  only I will try my best not to
disgrace you.'

She held out her hand to him as she spoke ;
it was a large well-shaped hand, but showed
traces of work. There were tears in her eyes,
but I do not think Basil saw them.

Then that is seeded, my dear he said
kindly enough : but I wished he had kissed
her  I think she expected it, for she sighed
in a disappointed way as she withdrew her
hand.

Come, this is first-rate,' exclaimed Mr.
Barton, rubbing up his hair again. ' Allie had
always the makings of a lady in her, and I shall
be proud and happy to see her in her right
place. Not but what I shall miss you,' looking
at her wistfully. ' You and me have always
been comfortable together, and the place will
be a bit dull without you ; but I have no call to
think of that. When shall } ou want her, Lynd-
hurst ? that is the next question.'

Had she not better come back with us tonight,
Basil ?' I asked. * There is no need for
any preparation.'

I thought Basil seemed disturbed at my question
; but a moment's reflection made him think
better of iJ".

Yes, why not ? You have not much packing
to do, have you, Aline ? You might put up
a few things, and let George send the rest ;
besides, I can get you all you want.'

To-night ?  come back with you to-night ?'
and Aline certainly looked frightened ; but her
brother gave her an encouraging pat on the
shoulder.

You had better strike when the iron's hot ;
there is nothing like getting a thing over.
Yes  yes ; go with your husband, Allie, and bea
good girl, and he'll be proud of you yet.'

Can I help you, my dear ?' I said in a low
voice ; but she shook her head.

There is not much to do, and Becky is used
to help me. Basil,' rather timidly, * would not
Miss Seton like some tea ? The kettle must
be boiling by now.'

That's an excellent idea !' Interposed her
]brother, without waiting for Basil to answer ; ' I
guess we are all pretty dry, talking so long.
Just you hurry up, Becky, there's a good lass.
Why,' with a laugh of intense enjoyment, ' to
think of my ordering about the Squire's lady in
this fashion! but you will look over it, Allie,
won't you ?'

I wish you would not talk such nonsense !'
she returned rather crossly, as she left the room.
Certainly Mrs. Basil Lyndhurst had not the
most angelic temper In the world ; but when she
returned, a few minutes later, all traces of sullenness
had vanished. I watched her with pleasure
as she helped the rough maid-of-all-work to set
the table. All her movements were slow,
but graceful. She did not seem conscious of
my observation ; but more than once I saw her
raise her dark eyes, and fix them on Basil In a
curiously searching manner ; but she scarcely
spoke as she poured out tea, except to ask her
brother once to pass the tea-cake to me.

Directly tea was over she went upstairs, and,
after a few minutes, Basil followed her. I think
he wanted to give her a hint or two about her
dress. The moment we were left alone, Mr.
Barton edged his chair a little nearer to me ina
confidential manner.

I am more glad than I can say, ma'am,' he
began respectfully, ' to see that there is a chance
of those two coming to a better understanding.
I don't mean to blame one more than another.
Allle has given Fleming a lot to bear ; but if he
had only been a little more patient with her !'

Has she  has Aline been going on better
lately ?'

Oh, I see you know all about it,' frowning

anxiously. * I suppose Fleming  bah ! I can't
o-et used to the new name ; Lyndhurst, I mean 
has told you ? Yes, it is a bad job for both of
them  these breaks-out of Allie's ; but she has
not had one for months. I do believe she is
ever so much better, poor girl ! She struggles
and prays against her temptation ; but at times
it seems as though the devil were too strong for
her. Her mother died of it, you see  not that
Allie knows that  that makes me not quite so
hard on her.'

But can nothing be done ?'

You must never let her taste anything
stronger than tea or coffee,' he returned
earnestly. ' Why, I never touch a drop of beer
even before her. Keep her amused and happy,
and give her a word of praise now and then,
just to let her see you are pleased with her, and
you will soon see what Allie is. She has done
a deal of fretting lately after Fleming and the
boy : it is a sore point with her, that neither of
them needs her. 1 was fearful that she would go
wrong with brooding over it ; but no, she has
kept herself straight.'

I am afraid you will miss her, Mr. Barton ?*

Well, ma'am,' in an odd, choked voice, ' you
are right about that. Allie is just the apple of
my eye. She has been my girl, you see, ever
since father and mother died, and I won't deny



it will be a bit dull for me ; though, as her husband
has the best nVht to her, I am not opine
to complain as long as he makes her happy.'
'Do you think she wishes to come with us ?'
That is a difficult question, ma'am. She is
sickening for a sight of the child, and she is
proud of beinor invited so kindly by her husband ;
but, in her heart, I expect Allie is mortally
afraid. It is going among strangers, you see ;
and then she has never been used to grandeur;
it will be kind of queer to her, having a livery
servant to stand behind her chair.'
Oh, she will soon get used to that.'
If you would only be her friend, and teach
her what to do !' he went on, looking at me so
wistfully that I was quite touched. ' You see,
Allie has never had a woman friend, and Becky,

though she is invaluable, has been a bit rouorh
with her. Now, a lady like yourself will be
different, and if you can only get an influence
over my poor girl !'

I will try my best  I will indeed, Mr.
Barton; and my sister will be good to her, too.'

Thank you kindly. Then I will not fash
myself overmuch. You will not be expecting
too much of the lass ? Allie is no talker ; even
with me she is mostly silent ; but she knows
how to make a house comfortable.'

I am olad to know that.'

Why, she has the cleverest fingers in the
world !'  warming into animation. ' You should
just see the set of shirts she has made for me !
You would not wish to see better work. And
she is industrious, too  never a moment idle,
except when she is in one of her bad states,
and then she will sit and do nothing for the
hour together. Why, the cakes and pies she
makes would astonish you ! And she keeps
the place as tidy as a new pin. Miss her!' 
rather grumpily  ' ay, and Becky will miss
her, too, for all the trouble she gives both of us
when she is in her tantrums.'

We were interrupted at this moment, for
Basil came back, and a few minutes afterwards
Aline followed him. She was dressed for walking,
and looked very nice. There was no fault
to be found in the gray gown, and hat bound
with a darker shade of gray velvet. I thought
from her appearance that she had been crying.

You have not been long getting ready,
Allie.'

No,' she said quietly, as she buttoned her
gloves ; * I had not much to do. Basil would
hardly let me take anything. He says my
clothes are not grand enough for Bloomfield
Hall, and that he must buy everything fresh, so
I have only got my blue cashmere besides
this.'

Never mind, my dear,' I interposed cheerfully
; ' you and I will come up to town and
order all you require.'

Shall I be able to come and see George too ?'
she asked anxiously.

Now, you are not going to trouble your
head about me,' returned her brother affectionately.
' Becky and I weill do first-rate
together ; shan't we, Becky ?'  as she stood
in the doorway, looking on rather grimly.
There ! you are ready now, so give us a kiss,
and don't keep Fleming waiting.'

I don't half like leaving you, George,* she
said, putting up her face to be kissed. ' No
one is half so good to me as you are. I doubt
but I shall repent it.'

Come, you might have paid me a prettier
compliment,' observed Basil good-humouredly.
Good-bye, George ! 1 will bring Aline back
to see you.'

He took hold of her arm, and hurried her
away, as though he dreaded a longer leave-taking.


Mr. Barton followed us to the door of the
shop, and watched us disconsolately as we
seated ourselves in the cab Becky had procured.
As we drove off. Aline leaned forward and
waved her hand to him.

Good-bye, dear old George !' she said un-vol.

II. 40

Steadily ; and a great tear rolled down her
cheek. * Are you sure you will take me to see
him, Basil ?'

Quite sure, my dear !'

Yes ; but he will not be welcome at Brookfield
Hall. George will never come and seeme
there,' she added sorrowfully ; and to this
Basil made no answer.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE WAY OPENS.

I heard his deep " I will "
Breathed like the covenant of a god, to hold
From thence thro' all the worlds.'

Tie Gardener's Daughter!

O happy world . . . all, meseems,
Are happy; I the happiest of them all.'

Tennyson.

'Oh, but she will love him truly ;
He shall have a cheerful home ;
She will order all things duly,

When beneath his roof they come.'

The Lord of Burleigh:

I HAD no time to myself the next morning.
When I came down to breakfast a note was
awaiting me from Miss Boyle. Her sister
had been taken ill on Saturday night with
some internal inflammation, and Dr. Langham
thought very badly of her. Hubert said at
once that he would go down to Fir Cottage to
inquire after the invalid, while I gave the

children their lessons. He brought me a very
bad report at luncheon - time. Poor Miss
Rosinaa was dying, and he had found our
Miss Boyle in great trouble. We had all
become very much attached to her ; she was
a worthy, kind-hearted creature, and so humble-minded
with all her cleverness. I begged
Hubert to let me go and offer my services, but
he said she had a cousin with her, a very nice
person, and that I should be only in the way.

 The greatest comfort I could give Miss
Boyle,' he went on, * was in telling her that you
would take her place with Mab and Jessie. I
begged her to be perfectly easy on that point,
as you and I would manage the lessons between
us. Let them come to me for their history and
arithmetic ; it will be such a pleasure to teach
them something ;' and as Mab and Jessie were
charmed with this idea, they went regularly to
the study for an hour during the three weeks
Miss Boyle stayed away, and I believe all three
were sorry when her return put a stop to lessons
with their father.

As the weather did not permit the little girls
to take their usual walk with nurse, I sat with
them in the schoolroom all the afternoon, while
they amused themselves making scrap-books
for the children's hospital. This was a
favourite occupation with them. I did not

venture into the drawing-room until I knew
Jane had taken in the tea, and then I invited
the twins to join me. I could never count on
Hubert ; and if Mr. Basil kept his word the
little girls would hinder any private talk. I felt
very artful and diplomatic as I went down with
Mab and Jessie hanging on either arm. They
were in high spirits, and wanted to know if the
drawing-room cake were nicer than the schoolroom
one.

When I am grown up, and give cook
orders,' observed Mab, ' I shall always say
plum-cake instead of seed ; no one but Willie
likes seedy-cakes, Aunt Olga.'

I was beginning to think I had schemed in
vain as we drank our tea, for no ring at the
door-bell announced a visitor. To be sure, he
said ' tomorrow or Tuesday.' Never mind,
Mab and Jessie must be invited again tomorrow
; and I tried to dismiss the subject
from my mind, and to give myself up to the
children, who were in high glee. By-and-by
Hubert joined us; he looked tired and weary,
but brightened up as Jessie flew to him, and
Mab pushed a heavy armchair closer to the fire.

Are you keeping Aunt Olga company, my
darlings ? Mab, do you think you could pour
me out a cup of tea ? I want Aunt Olga to do
something for me. Olga, do you remember

those papers old Mrs. Stevenson gave me
about that good - for - nothing son of hers ?
They were in a thick blue envelope ; and I
know I put thcni in one of the racks on my
writing-table. Do you think you could lind
them, my dear ?'

I will look, Hubert. Jessie, that cake is
cold. There is some hot toast on the trivet for
father;' and I went away' (quickly.

The study-door was half closed. As I pushed
it open I came face to face with Mr. Basil !

'You have come to look for Mrs. Stevenson s
papers ?' he said coolly. ' 'I'hat's all right ; but
the Vicar does not wain them fcr the next
hour ;' and then he closed the door, and the
next moment I found myself held fast. ' How
could you have the heart to do it ?' he was
s lying ; * how could you have the heart to send
me away, my darling ?'

I never knew how pertinacious Basil could
be ; he gave me no peace until I had answered
his questions. I found, to my surprise, that
his self-distrust was so great, that he thought
so little of himself, and souci of me, that he
could not bring himself to believe that I really
cared for him ; when I found out what he felt,
1 did all I could to satisfy him, and he was so
grateful to me for my frank confession.

I know I am not worthy of you,' he said
humbly, as he drew me closer to him ; * but you
have done much for me already, and you will
do more. I always looked up to you as a little
saint, Olga. Do you remember, dear, that
evening of our dinner-party, when my poor
Aline disgraced herself? I shall never forget
what I felt when you put your arms round her,
and laid your cheek against hers ! " Come with
me, and I will take care of you." Was not that
what you said ? Olga, it was all I could do not
to bless you aloud for your goodness. I felt
neither Aline nor I was fit to kiss the ground
under your dear feet.'

Oh, Basil, do not talk so ! It was no goodness.
I loved her  I always loved her.'

I believe you did ; that is why I sent you
her ring. Darling, you will have to wear my
ring now, for Mr. Leigh  what a brick he is ! 
thinks that we may as well be engaged at once.*

It was all your fault,' I began ; but he knew
too well to let me finish.

What a good thought it was my fetching
those plans on Saturday evening ! I meant to
behave as well as possible ; but when I saw you
change colour every minute I knew it was all
up with our secret. When he had it out with
me just now, I told him that I considered
myself engaged. " That's all right," he said,

with a laugh : " I will send Olga in, and then
you can sense it." And we have settled it,
haven't we, des ?'

I tried to tell him now about my conversation
with Hubert, for he was so happy, and in such
spirits, thai there was no him to the

point He kept asking ir questions

 how long I had like - - :-high I

could possibly answer that question ; if I ready
and truly cared for him nxxe than Jem.

I was always jealous of that fellow,' he said.

Dear Jem " I sighed.

*Yes: b-: he dces not come first now, or
Reggie either.'

Xa of course doc Reggie ! What an idea !
As though I ' ' -n before you 1 Do
kl me tell yc -i.'

No, he SL a dejected air. I
know what you are going to say, and I have
heard it already. We are to be engaged for
fifteen months  unto you are two-and-twenty.
I was obliged to agree to everything, for fear of
losing you altogether : but '

You think nfteen months  a poor little year
and a quarter  too long to wait for me. Mr.
F'" waited eight-and-twenty years for
A : -erne.'

I ought to have known Baal better ; he was
not likely to submit tamely to such a reproof.

and I had to listen 10 a song narang~je, made
with a great deal of energy. He would wait
for me half his life, he said, if duty demanded
it. He was quite sure of me ; I was not the
girl to tell a fellow she loved him and then
change her mind, and on that point I had made
him quite happy, perfectly happy ; but, all the
same, he wanted to man' me as soon as possible,
I could not blame him for wishing this ; any
fellow in his circumstances would be as anxious
as he was ; and he must call my attention to
one point, that in his case it was not so much
selfishness as a clear-sighted thoughtfulness for
other people. He was afraid that I was not
sufficiently alive to his virtues ; when he said
other people, he did not presume to place me
amongst them, as he was far too painfully convinced
that I would agree cheerfully to a fifteen
years' engagement.

Oh, Basil !' in a shocked voice at this point.

No : I must not interrupt him. He was
speaking of his mother, who was so clearly in
need of a daughter, and of Reggie, whose infantile
years certainly pleaded for maternal
management. Basil's face was a study as he
completed this audacious speech.

But I was not to be silenced by any flow of
eloquence, and in spite of my interruptions,
I had mv sav at last. I told Basil that he had

made me so happy, so very happy, that there
was no room in my heart for selfishness ; that
he must let me do my duty to Hubert and the
children, and not be too exacting, for I loved
him so much yes. I actually told him that 
that a word from him, even a gesture of impatience,
would pain me terribly ; and when he
saw how earnest I was he did not tease meany
more, and nothing could exceed his gentleness.


My little sunbeam,' he said, very tenderly,
I cannot have you look so grave ; don't you
know a word from you is enough ? I (suite
understand, my dearest, and 1 promis(! you that
)ou shall never have anything to bear from my
impatience.'

And you will be happy, Basil ?'

Perfectly happy and content in waiting for
you, do you mean ? Yes ; a thousand times,
yes. boom this day we begin our new life
together, for I shall do nothing without you,
decide nothing, enjoy nothing. I shall see you
every day ; I shall be here as much as possible.
Olga, can that possibly be the dressing-bell ?'

I looked at the clock in dismay  half-past
six  and we had been talking for an hour and
a half. Basil looked amused at my horrified
expression, and suggested that we should go in
search of Hubert. We found him (quietly reading

by the fire. The little girls had gone
upstairs. He looked up with a smile as we
entered.

Have you brought me the papers, Olga ?'
he asked, and then he opened his arms to me.

Oh, how dear and good Hubert was to us both
that night ! He would not let Basil leave us ;
and, indeed, as he whispered to me afterwards,
he had no intention of going ; and when dinner
was over, he talked to us in so kind and fatherly
a manner, and he made me so proud and happy
by praising me to Basil. I never knew how
much I loved him until that night.

Basil took me the next day to see his mother ;
she literally wept for joy, and I was ready to
join her, when she confessed that this had been
for months the wish of her heart, and afterwards
we both wrote to Aunt Catherine and Jem.

Their answers perfectly satisfied me. Aunt
Catherine's was very short, but every word
expressed her perfect contentment.

'You have made me very happy,' she wrote ;
nothing earthly could have pleased me more.
I shall not now have a care for Basil ; you will
suit his peculiar nature utterly and entirely.
And, Olga, you have long been very dear tome
; now you will be one of us,' and so on 
such a letter as only Aunt Catherine could
write.

As for Jem's, it was so perfectly unique, so
altogether delicious, that Basil said I ought to
have it framed as a model of brotherly correspondence.
The dear fellow was literally
brimming over with fun and affection and
satisfied ambition  only one sentence was quite
grave :

I have long ago changed my opinion about
Lyndhurst; I always thought he had the
makings of a fine fellow, only I distrusted him
for awhile. I do not now own that he is perfect
worthy of you ; there is not a fellow
divine good enough for such a dear little soul ;
but he will do, and I have made up my mind
to give you a blessing, so here goes,' et cetera,
et cetera. Oh, how we laughed over that
letter !

We had been engaged about ten days ; poor
Miss Rosinaa Boyle had been buried nearly a
week, and her sister had not yet resumed her
duties, when one afternoon, as I was giving-mab
her music-lesson, there was a knock at the
door, and Basil entered. I was beginning to
be used to see him at any time in the day, for
he was seldom absent for many hours from
Fircroft. He would snatch half an hour whenever
he could to talk over any little matter with
me that interested him. This time he had
brought me a message from his mother ; she

wanted me particularly, he said. Could not
Mab finish her music by herself ? I made
a little demur at this, but he was very urgent.
He was not going back to the Hall for an hour
or two  he had to ride to Bradley ; he begged
me to remain until he returned, but I would
not promise this.

'Well, we will leave that part,' he replied,
with a smile that told me that he was pretty
certain to get his way, ' only do go now as
quickly as possible ; In fact, I mean to wait
until I see you out of the house ;' and seeing
this was his mood, I told Mab to finish her
scales by herself, and put on my hat as quickly
as possible.

Ladybird was waiting for her master, and I
left Basil for a moment while I fetched her
some sugar. The pretty creature knew me
well, for I had always petted her. I could not
help looking after my Squire as he rode off,
Basil always looked so well on horseback. He
saw me and waved his hat gaily, and then I
walked on.

I thought Bennet looked unusually pleased
to see me, but he asked me to wait In the
library a few minutes before I went to his
mistress. This somewhat surprised me, for I
was unused to any formality at the Hall ; but
I understood his motive better the next moment,

when I found myself folded in Aunt Catherine's
arms. My ecstasy may be imagined. So this
was the reason, then, why Basil had been so
urgent with me.

The surprise was so great for a moment that
I could only kiss her without speaking, and I
could see there were tears in her soft gray
eyes.

Are you pleased to see me, Olga ? My
dear, I could not stay away any longer. I was
just longing to see you and Basil, so I made
Robert bring me, and we have been here since
one o'clock. We slept at St. Jude's Vicarage
last night, and came on here this morning.'

And you have seen Basil ?'

Yes ; and talked to him, too. How happy
the boy is ! he looks better and younger already;
and  well, darling. I think you can imagine our
conversation.*

You have no idea how good he is to me !' 
rather shyly.

Come, you shall tell me about it ; that is
why I told Bennet to show you into the library,
because I wanted you all to myself. Do you
know how refreshing it is to see your sweet
little face ? Basil says you are just an embodied
sunbeam ! I call that a ver' pretty,
lover-like speech.*

Oh, what a talk we had ! I felt then as though

my happiness were complete. Aunt Catherine
was the only one to whom I could tell everything
; she understood in a moment that mv one
anxiety was how long Basil's patience would
last out.

It will last as long as it is needed was her
comfortable answer. ' Basil is perfectly content
to wait a reasonable time, and he thinks Mr.
Leigh's stipulation unreasonable under the
circumstances ; of course, if it had been possible,
he would rather have married you at
once, but he will not let himself think of that 
Basil is not the least selfish.'

Oh no I no one could be less so, Aunt
Catherine. I hope you will not think me
tidoretv ; but. indeed, I do not see how Hubert
is to spare me even then !'

Do you not ? Well, I have an idea on the
subject ; and so has Basil. Your news about
poor Miss Rosinaa Boyle put the notion in my
head ; her sister s death has set Miss Boyle free
to take your place.'

My place !'

Well, perhaps not that exactly, for she could
not be Mr. Leigh's companion ; but, as regards
the children and the care of the household, she
could certainly take your place ; indeed, I never
knew any person so entirely trustworthy. If she

VOL. III. 6 1

be the plainest, she is certainly one of the nicest
people I know.'

Do you mean that she should come and live
at Fircroft ?'

Perhaps not live there entirely ; but that
must depend on Mr. Leigh's wishes. But what
could be easier than for her to come every morning,
and remain until the children's bedtime }
She might still keep her rooms at Fir Cottage,
and so maintain her independence ; but, in my
opinion, there is nothing to prevent a woman of
her age  and she looks fifty at least  taking
charge of a widower's household. She is not
young, at least in h(r appearance, or attractive
enough to make such a position awkward ; but,
as I said before, this is for your brother to
arrange.'

And you think that by tb.at time I can be
spared }'

That the way will open. Yes, Olga, I do
think so, and Basil is sure of it. With miss
Boyle at Fircroft, and you at the Hall, there
can be very little difficulty in the matter. You
will always be on the spot to supervise or consult
with Miss Boyle ; she will be able to refer
all feminine questions to you. The children will
be with you constantly  every day  they will
bring their lite affairs to you to setde ; your
brother will do the same. Are )'ou convinced

now that everyone is right in not allowing you
to martyr yourself ?'

 Yes ; and I could not do it. I could not
give up Basil ; but still it troubles me to think
of Hubert being all alone.'

Put that out of your head for the present ;
in another year he will be more fit to be left.
His children will occupy his thoughts, and give
interest to his life ; he is strong enough and
good enough to stand alone. You know how
highly I have always thought of him  but
never so highly as now, when I have watched
him in his trouble.'

'He is an example to us all ; even Basil
says so.'

Basil respects him as much as I do. Well,
my dear, he will still have his faithful little
sister near him. What can be more easy than
for you and Basil to sacrifice an evening now
and then to cheer him in his solitude or to coax
him up to the Hall ? not to mention the hours
you will contrive to spare him between your
own duties. My dear, you do not know Basil
When he gets you to himself, he will be too happy
to be exacting ; he will be the first to remind
you of your duty to others.'

Oh, Aunt Catherine ! you always say such
nice things. It is not only words ; but you do give
one such real, solid comfort. You have taken

61  2

away every little tiresome scruple, and I feci as
lifht as air.'

Then yoii must come and talk to Robert
now; he is with XMrinia in the drawinL;-r()()m.
Oh ! there are Ladybird's hoofs galloping up the
avenue. Basil is in a hurry to jet back to his
sweetheart ; let us go and meet him !'

Basil gave me a droll look as he sprang
from his saddle.

Are you not glad 1 interrupted Mab's music
lesson ?' he asked as he joined me. * Were you
(ever more surprised in your life. Olga ?'

There is no one like her,' I returned, in a
whisper; 'and, oh, Basil, she has made me so
happy about things!'

Vcs. 1 know.' with a glance of full understanding;
: ' that is just what you wanted  a talk
with Aunt Catherine f and then we could say no
more, as Mr. I'lcming was crossing the room to
speak to us.

Aunt Catherine was right, and the way has
opened. It is eighteen months since she said
those words to me, and for three of those months
1 have been Basil's wife. Everything has happened
as she predicted. Miss Boyle is at
hircroft  a trusted, faithful friend of the whole
family  and I am at the Hall, its happy, its
most happy mistress I M\ husband says he

has now not a wish ungratified. I almost
tremble when he tells me so ; but, indeed, I
could say the same myself. There is no one in
the world so blessed as I am. Sometimes when
Reggie calls me mother, and Basil smiles as he
hears it, the tears come into my eyes ; but they
are tears of joy. We talk often of those old
days at St. Croix and of La Maisonnette, and
again and again I bless the day when Aunt
Catherine and I crossed the sea on that quest
that seemed so hopeless then, and yet was so
near fruition  the search for Basil Lyndhurst.
