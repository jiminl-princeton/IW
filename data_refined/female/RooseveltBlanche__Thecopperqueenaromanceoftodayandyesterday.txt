CHAPTER 1.

Enilda and Flora had been but a few days in
London when the mail brought them letters from
home ; amongst others from Mr. Rozen and Florestan,
and a very long one from Mrs. Chromo. Mr. Rozen
was full of regret for his dear girl's departure, and
fuller yet of his multitude of cares and troubles ; whilst
Florestan's letter, although couched in friendly terms,
in every word breathed an under-current of love
which amounted to a passion ; for if Enilda had
known before that he cared for her, she now read
between the lines, and saw in every space a newer
declaration of his affection.

Since her meeting with Claremont she had been
a prey to such strange sensations that not only she
scarcely dared to define them, but she scarcely dared
admit even to herself what she felt now to be the

VOL. III. B

truth  that Claremont held as of old the first place
in her heart. The day following her arrival she had
refused to see him, and Flora had given him the
coveted dish of tea ; but if Enilda refused one morning,
fate threw him in her path the next; whilst
Lady Mildred, unsuspicious and unwearying in hospitality,
so managed that not a day passed but they
either lunched, dined, or went to the play together.
Enilda could not plead ill health as an excuse for
not accepting Lady Mildred's invitations, for in
reality she had never been so well before in her
whole life. Then, too, since their meeting on the
steamer, at sight of his face or sound of his voice,
that strange old fascination would creep over her,
and as helplessly enfold her in its toils as the boa-constrictor
enfolds its victim. She had never yet
seen him alone  so far fortune had befriended her
yet she dreaded to think of what that meeting
might be, for she felt sure come it must some day.
She was turning Florestan's letter over idly in her
hand, and thinking  not of him, but of Claremont.
She was suddenly startled out of her thoughts by
a shriek of laughter from Flora.

My dearest child," she cried, " jvdiat on earth
are you laughing at ? "

Flora continued laughing, but explained that
she was reading Mrs. Chromo's letter, and the news

Was too funny. " Stays'* she added ; " I'll read it to
you entire. If you aren't surprised I'll give in. Lucy
Chromo is a dear, but between ourselves, 'Enilda
chile as Charlotte Corday says, she's no chicken,
and ought to know better. Now, Miss Chandos-
Cressy, for instance : she's old enough to eat grass,
but I don't believe even she would be as idiotic
as Lucy is. Listen :

"dearest Flora,

"you wondered why I didn't come to Europe
with you ; why at the last moment I had to stop at
home ? Well, I may as well tell you the truth, first
as last. Nearly a year ago I determined that if
Adam Chromo wouldn't give up the glue business
in short, retire on his laurels and money  that I
would be divorced from him, as I could no longer
stand the sight of those filthy, brazen carts, chirping
up and down the Avenue constantly before my very
eyes. The end of all is, he wouldn't sacrifice them ;
he preferred to sacrifice me : not unusual, dear, when
you marry simply that compound of nature's cunning,
classically called  man. I did not care to let New
York into the secret of my domestic affairs, so have
always kept the matter extremely quiet. Before the
world Adam and myself have ever preserved an
outward semblance of harmony; behind it  well,

not a semblance, but a reality of awful discord.
Every word I have spoken to him at meals, or before
a servant, has been taken down for me by my
faithful Zenobia; for Adam, by his equally faithful
Tristram. These conversations, I need not tell you,
are destined as evidence when our case comes up
for trial; the which trial, I need not say, comes
off the first of September next. You can imagine
how I feel, and what I have borne during the past
year. My lawyer, Mr. Harkins, a sweet, angelic man,
has heard all my pros and cons. I believe that is
the legal way to put it, and he thinks that Adam
Chromo is a brute, and has morally mopped the
floor up with me for years. Absolute incompatibility
of temper is the least I have against him. Oh,
Flora ! pity me. Tell Enilda all, and whatever you
do, either of you, never marry an idiotic, opinionated,
self-made American. Other races of men change 
American men  never. Adam could not forget that
he had, so to speak, manufactured himself. He used
to boast of what he was  a Virginian stable-boy in
extreme youth  and what he is novo. I have often
told him, that to a proud, even haughty  you know
me, Flora, I have often been haughty, but never
with you ;  a proud, even haughty woman like myself,
a Mayflower descendant, he was not Hercules,
and those Augean reminiscences had an unsavoury

smell in the millionnaire's parlour. I have even said,
Leave me out of the question ; but you  you yourself,
have you no pride ? " Result ! Well, girls, both of
you  you see he hasn't. I wish you could have seen
the lawyer's face when he took in our breakfast-table
conversation, faithfully reported by Zenobia  too
faithfully for Adam,  which was but one speaking
instance of the brutality and humiliation we women
are subject to at times. Mind, I say at times, for
although the race in general deserves wholesale
reprobation, I have known some masculine exceptions,
of which I could name three or four on the
spot. I have more news, which will keep until my
arrival. What sort of a house is it ? Park Lane
sounds very nice. Mr. Rozen told me all about
it. How many servants are there ? They say
June and July are the months in London, so I
am counting on a lovely time. By the way, we
come over in a large party  Mr. Florestan, the
Count, Mr. Cherubini, and your humble servant.
Let me not forget Miss Chances-Cressy, who has
just told me that she is great-aunt to a titled lady 
married to an old flame of mine, John Claremont  ' "

"Ah!"

What is it ? "

I  I thought some one came in ; I see I was
mistaken. Go on."

' John Claremont, whom I was once  may I say
completely gone on ? It wasn't the man, but his
manners, they were so different from those of all
American men : but that's over  " All's well  that 
is worth two in the bush," I shouldn't be at all surprised
if Professor Protoplasm came with us after all.
I believe he's sweet on Miss C.-C. Something else
also has happened, but that must be a secret until
after my divorce has been pronounced. I am going
to be presented at Court with you girls this season,
as no woman, I hear, can go to Court after the little
affair above-mentioned has been consummated.
Ridiculous, isn't it ?  but I suppose in England they
must draw the line somewhere. I am nearly dead,
but must add a word to say that Enilda's papa looks
very worried and anxious. I see there has been some
law-suit on for that Vane, and perhaps Mr. Rozen
was worried about it. That comes of being a silent
partner. Pve always said they have all the fretting,
all the responsibility, and all the work. If Adam
would only become a silent partner in his own
concern  but that is a dream.

' Don't think I regret the step I have taken. I
don't love him, but I still have a sneaking kind of
regard for him, and sometimes wonder what will
become of him without me ; but he deserves it. Perhaps
when he finds me firm he will listen to reason.

He will settle ten million dollars on me, so that I
shan't starve ; but it seems little compared to what I
have been in the habit of commanding. Of course
one can live upon that, but it will be an odious
thought to say to myself every day and every
minute, as I know I shall be obliged to say, " Lucy
Chromo, deny yourself this, deny yourself that ; your
exchequer is now miserably limited."

"ewe sail in the "Electra;" lovely steamer. I
have the bridal chambers,  alas ! strange mockery of
a happy past. Forgive me, girls, for wilting now at
the last moment, so to speak, but I cannot help
it. If I don't leave New York soon, I shall
rupture a blood-vessel in the brain, or somewhere
else. I have said good-bye to Adam, and  goodbye
I feel it is. Will telegraph arrival from
Queenstown.

' With fond love, ever the same,

"lucy Chromo.'

' Now, Enilda, what can you say to a woman like
Lucy Chromo ? " Flora laughed as she spoke. " Isn't
she a fool to give up all that money, and  and as
decent a man as one could find in the whole of
America, hunt where you may ? What do you repose
the secret is ? "

I haven't an idea "

Perhaps she is going to marry again."

Perhaps."

"Enilda, how oddly you answer me; aren't yon
well?"

"Perfectly."

"Perfectly? Let me see." Flora took Enilda's
chin in her hand and turned the fair face up to the
light.

The object of this scrutiny blushed.

Nonsense, Flora," she cried petulantly ; " I am
perfectly Avell, only  only I was wondering about 
about papa. I confess I am worried. Do you think
he is seriously ill ? "

Enilda's eyes filled with tears.

"I think Lucy Chromo is an idiot," cried
Flora. "I'm out of patience with her. Of course
your father isn't ill; at worst it could only be
some stock sone wronoj. What is he  a bull or a
bear ? "

I  I really don't know ; perhaps he's both. Perhaps
he may be a bear for one kind and a bull for
the other; but I've heard people who know Wall
Street as well as their pocket-books say that bull is
one profession and bear is another. It's as different
as being a chemist and botanist, you know,"

"It is all strange talk to me, dear; but I don't
believe it is stock ; in fact I know it isn't. I asked

him once, and he said distinctly, No. Perhaps hein
love."

"Flora!"

Well, dear, have you never dreamed that some
such elinor misfht be the case ? "

Never. Papa adored mamma. Her awful death
made him a chant-ed man. He has since devoted

o

himself to me, and couldn't look at another woman :
every day he seems to love me more. No one ever
had a father like mine  like  "

Enilda stopped abruptly, although her eyes were
still overrun with tears. In fancy she went back
to a year ago. She was reading Claremont's letter
her father was consoling her  then she was in
Naples, in Rome, wandering here, there, everywhere;
he always silencing her heartaches by his
infinite tenderness, his watchfulness, his constant
care.

Flora kissed her.

"Dear," she said, "I won't quarrel with you
about parents, although I think my own are the
best 'as ever was;' only you mustn't worry about
him; crying and so on: besides, you'll spoil your
eyes  'the loveliest eyes in the world,' as Mr.
Claremont says."

Flora, what do you mean ? "

"Enilda, don't fly at me like that. What do

you mean ? Can't a man admire your eyes ? A
'cat may look at a king.' I only say if a man
admires my eyes, I don't see why he can't come
directly to me, and tell me, instead of waltzing
around to other women and saying what he thinks of
me ! What's that ?  a ' gram ' ;  give it here. Oh,
it's for you, Enilda."

A servant handed Enilda the regulation yellow
envelope.

"They've arrived," she said; "read. Lucy will be
here tomorrow, and  and Mr. Florestan."

Flora jumped joyfully about like a school-girl.

'eat last," she said; "now we can besoin to
have some fun. But two things we'll prohibit;
no talking divorce; no abusing Adam Chromo
behind his back. What do you say, 'Nilda?  and
and  no talking about your pater, and  and
worries."

I must know exactly how papa is ; but as to
talking over her proposed divorce  that  well, that
is out of the question."

"Perhaps she'll abandon the idea if we have a
good go at her about it."

My dear child, what business is it of yours or
mine ? At least leave her to the enjoyment of her
own private affairs. Now I have something to
confide in you. I have taken a growing dislike to

Count de Marcie. I see him in dreams mixed up
with papa, and I can't make it out; after such a
night I really wake up with  with  well, with a
bad taste in my mouth, if you know what I mean
by that."

I know exactly ; an encyclopaedia in ten volumes
couldn't have expressed it better."

I see that Lucy Chromo is getting as thick with
the Count as two peas in a pod, and I hope she
won't have him here all the time; I feel I couldn't
stand it."

My dear, the house is yours."

Oh no ; I don't mean that. Of course, Lucy is
kind enough to chaperone us. The house is hers ; she
spoke something about taking it together, and so on ;
but that is all nonsense. The best friends in the
world fight after a month of having kept house
together ; dividing household expenses, and so on. I
know of nothing more fatal to mutual esteem."

Perhaps as you are not devoted chums it would
work all right."

"Yes; that might be an antidote, but I am not
going to try it. Papa has arranged everything. He
has invited her to be my guest, but practically to
be the head of the house."

"So we girls are on a visit to Lucy. How
funny ! "

It is funny when you think of it ; but as papa
couldn't come, and your mamma wouldn't come 
and he  papa  insisted on my coming to Europe,
and so did Charlotte Corday  "

"My dearest Enilda, what has she to do with
it?"

Oh nothing ; only  only I love her dearly. She
has been like a mother to me."

Happily she didn't nurse you ; you might have
been black."

Nonsense." Enilda smiled faintly for the first
time since reading her letters. "Nonsense; only
Charlotte had a strange fainting-fit ; and after that
she kept saying, ' Let's go away, honey chile  away
from New York ; ' and when I said papa wishes me
to go to London, she seemed tickled to death, and
she was so broken-down, poor thing, I thought we
might as well come, so  here we are."

She seems to enjoy London hugely, and now I
think of it looks as spry as a 'possum'  to quote
her words. But come, are we ooingj to the Row or
not this morning ? "

Oh yes, of course ; I had quite forgotten our
engagement."

Lady Mildred is a dear, not a bit like the stiff
Englishmen you read about  but wdiat a funny
country !  she, my Lady ; he, plain Mister. Imagine

a husband taking a back seat in America  being
only"

Only the husband of madam."

"Yes; and  and do you know, Enilda, I don't
believe they're happy together. She loves him, and
he don't love her. If I didn't know better, I should
sa" he's mashed on you. It's the clearest case of  "

In spite of herself Enilda trembled as she thought :
What ! had she alone been blind ? Did John
Claremont still care for her ?  and did he respect her
his wife  so little that he let all the world see it ?
Could it be possible ? "

Heavens upon earth," cried Flora, " what fools weare
! The ship is in ; this gram isn't from Queenstown
at all, but from Liverpool. Why, they'll be
here in no time."

Enilda looked again, then rang and began giving
directions about Lucy's rooms, the dinner, and  then
she reflected. The Claremont were dining there
that very night; should she put them off? Flora
divined her brown study.

Let's have a grand square-toed dinner in the
impromptu line, all together. Lady Mildred is sure
to like Lucy, and she won't be too tired after the
trip. What fun ! what fun ! Do give orders at
once."

Enilda demurred, but Flora finally had her warders

were given ; the girls went to the park ;
kicked with Lady Mildred afterwards, and two
hours later were embracing Lucy and Miss Chandos-
Cressy at the railway-terminus. They were nil
lauofhino: and chattering 'thirteen to the dozen"
about the trip.

Florestan shook Enilda's hand warmly, and looked
into her eyes with so glad a light in his that she
felt a thrill leaping in every vein. She was sorry
for him, and yet she could not tell why ; only John
Claremont's face always came between hers and any
others, if that other happened to be a man's. Would
it be ever so ? She had intended welcoming Florestan
warmly ; instead, she turned her face away and
greeted him coldly.

"Something has happened," he thought, and his
heart died within him. He had counted the hours
of the long voyage. Every plash of the waves
against the steamer's paddle, every opaline tint which
crested the little hills receding from the stern, had
said to him, "You are leaving me behind, but you
are going to her;" and on those fair nights when
the silver moonlight made an endless track across
the broad expanse of water he repeated, " One day
more which separated us is gone. I am one day
nearer to her." He had looked at the last crests
flashing from the bow, and almost heard the last

sound of the screw as the all-potent iron cleaved the
impuissant Atlantic ; he had heard " All's well ! "
cried out for the last time ; he was landed in London
at last, and she  she was standing by his side saying
coldly :

So glad to see you. I hope you had a charming
trip ; you must dine with us to-night. Flora
insists on our having a real family party."

Flora," he thought ; " ah !  she it was who asked
me,  who cared to see me 1 "

And, dear Cyril, you haven't brought him ? "
Florestan smiled sadly.

'cyril is with his grand mamma. I shall miss
him, but mother wouldn't hear of my bringing such
a little fellow so far."

"Oh, I'm sorry; I had so hoped to see him. I
love him dearly."

At that moment Florestan was near hating him.
"Even my child," he thought bitterly, "she loves
him, but  she has no love for me." He was going
to refuse the dinner; he conceived the wild project of
returning to New York by the next steamer. "She
is a heartless woman," he thought, " and I will think
of her no more." He looked up brusquely. She
was speaking to him in a softer voice ; only a softer
voice, one little cadence sweeter than a moment since,
and at its music all his latent resolutions vanished.

"I am sure you won't plead a prior engagement,"
she said; "I can't let you say no. There
will be some old friends; amongst others the Lady
Mildred Claremont, and  and her husband,  delightful
people ;  also some new acquaintances, Lord and
Lady St. Ermine, Baron d'Alfredi, and many others.
Lady St. Ermine is a lovely woman, a poetess  not a
bit of the has blue."

He lifted his hands in horror.

"Prepare yourself," she said laughingly, "for a
very young woman, fair, lovely, adorable; eyes like
wood-violets shining with morning dew, and a face
like an unfinished sketch by an old master  Raphael,
for instance,  and she the Sitting Madonna in  in
English"

"My dear," interrupted Lucy Chromo, "don't
spring old masters on me at this stage of the game."
Then she added quickly, " How foggy it is ! The
Count got off at Queenstown, wasn't it odious of him ?
but  he is coming on tomorrow or the day after."

Enilda some way breathed a sigh of relief. She
was happy to think that even forty-eight hours had
come between them. Florestan's voice sounded in
her ears.

You know your wishes are, as ever, my law. Of
course I shall come. Eight, you say? and I add
eight sharp.' "

The dinner was finished and the men dawdJino-
over wine, cigars, and scandal; perhaps political,
but certainly scandal. John Claremont was looking
at Florestan. His brow was clouded, and a dark
light sombre his eyes. He had been thus studying
him ever since he had revived a very slight acquaintanceship
began in New York months since. When
Enilda left the room he surprised a glance on
Florestan's face which roused every bad passion in
his nature.

He loves her," he thought ; " and she  she has
forgotten me. She loves him ; but I would kill her
with my own hand before she should ever marry
him."

VOL. Ill,

Chapter II.

At last the great affair was over. Mrs. Chromo,
Enilda, and Flora had gone bare-necked on a bitter
day to pay court to a Sovereign whose virtues like
her name were world-wide. They did not regret
the biting east wind, the lonsc drive to Buckinshaiu
Palace, the long wait before presentation, nor the
gradual deepening of the skin from rose to violet,
and the standing for hours before their turns came.
The three had previously taken lessons from a
fashionable drawing-room teacher, and at home they
had rehearsed their parts ; Lucy Chromo being the
queen, Flora the wife of the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Enilda the victim. Then the roles were
reversed, each in turn assuming the state of queen,
mistress of ceremonies, and young lady to be presented.
Enilda certainly excelled in grace, Flora in
audacity, and Lucy in dignity. At last the teacher
pronounced them perfect, and declared that from

their ease and manner they might have passed their
lives at Court. " It is astonishing," she said, " how
Americans get on," and added, " Ladies, I never
before had such pupils. It is as if you were born to
the purple."

When they saw their noses and shoulders growing
so high-coloured in broad daylight, they began to
think that not only were they born to it, but that
they had inherited it then and there.

Few women can stand the crucial test of the
Drawing-room, and long before they reached the
Palace Lucy began to grumble, Flora to fret, and
Enilda to declare that " it might as well be in the
evening anyway ; " but their murmuring were " a
vain thing," and after hours of unavoidable peripatetic
they finally found themselves in the Royal
apartment, where the members of the Royal Family
in brilliant automatic guard stood to the risfht and
left of her most gracious Majesty the Queen.

When the important moment came Enilda trembled
like a leaf in the storm.

I know I shall do something awful," whispered
Flora, whilst Lucy preserved such a dignity that her
bosom heaved and threatened to burst the bounds
of her corsage, whose scantness, the fashion, the
dressmaker, and her own personal courage had all
mutually agreed upon. It was over : the page had

c 2

held Enilda's train ; she had advanced as if she were
walking on eggs; she had bowed she never could
tell how; had stretched out her arm she never knew
Ashen ; the Queen had placed a gentle hand thereon ;
and she had kissed it she never realized where.

Flora, in spite of her presentiment, had creditably
gone through the same performance ; but Lucy, her
face in a glow, her breast in a storm, and her heart
like a stone, at the last instant had dropped her
superb dignity. As a super drops his mantle at the
very moment he should have kept it on, so all her
fine airs fled from her the instant she most needed
them ; she stumbled in her petticoats ; she couldn't
get near enough to the Queen. And the kiss that
should have exploded on the royal hand rent the
air a few fathoms off like a signal falling foul at sea.
Then the agony about the dress was unendurable.
She bent, she heard it strain, strain again, then a
cunning sound like the splitting of ship's timbers ina
gale smote her ear ; in spite of a pound of hairdresser
s pins, her hair, not particular which end it
stood on, raised, and the prickling at the roots drove
all the blood from her heart to the upper part of her
arms. Oh, to dare to look up ; to scream, to do anything!
 but impossible. Had anything happened?
Happily nothing ; for in spite of warnings her bodice
proved stronger than her nerves. She finished her

salutation in a whole frock, but a dead faint ; and if
she had not created a sensation at her appearance,
she certainly did on her disappearance. Proper
restoratives brought her to, and when she got away
from the Palace she realized the blessedness of
exceptions to rules, viz. Tennyson's 

Of all sad words of tongue or 'pen,
The saddest are these, ' it might have been.' "

It was indeed over. " The agony was somewhat
abated." Happily, although the circumstances were
not the same as those Byron describes in  in one of
his poems 

Alas, we must awake before,
We know such vision comes no more ; "

Lucy knew that her Drawing-room if not her day
was ended, and as they drove down the Mall in the
budding twilight Enilda consoled and Flora comforted
: but she for the first time in her life remarked
'That she was glad America was a Republic," and
grateful tears bursting from her eyes, a calm followed
the storm, and she began to think not about her
presentation but her dinner. When she fully recovered
the effects of her fright at what might have
been, she was so grateful for the escape that she
even contemplated making herself a British subject,
and paved the way by sending cheques to all the

London hospitals, until her enthusiasm, like her
money, gradually grew *' beautifully less."

Enilda was now in the full swing of the London
season. Her title of " Copper Queen " had followed
her from America; she was oftener called that than
by her name. Her beauty, modesty, and manners
won all hearts. Royalty smiled upon her, and
the upper ten bore her upon its classic but tired
shoulders. She was invited to luncheons, dinners,
balls, suppers, to routs and to races, to Henley and
Buckingham, to attend fish-dinners at Greenwich
and fruit-stalls at Kew, Her life was one whirl of
pleasurable excitement. London was so adorable
that she wondered how she had ever even liked
New York:

And John Claremont ! As yet they had never
been alone together. When they met he was full
of a grave politeness, which, as she became accustomed
to it, daily threw her more and more off her
guard. After that farewell at Euston, where he had
pressed her hand with such violence, he had never
betrayed himself by a similar movement. They
met as people meet who have nothing in common
beyond the civilities of ordinary friendship. Enilda
no longer trembled in secret, no longer pictured to
herself any time when she would hear from his lips
an explanation that she had once thought him bound

to give her. But would he ever make that explanation
? Was there anything to say ? He had married
another woman, not for that other one's money  that
she would never admit, but because he no longer
truly loved her. It was very simple : men had done
those things since the world began. " Perhaps it
was half my fault," she would say. " I didn't throw
myself at his head, but I certainly made no objection
to his throwing; himself at mine." Then she would
go on thinking, and lose herself in a maze of fancy,
whose end was what its bemnnino had been 
irritation. Irritation against herself, against Claremont,
his wife, Flora, Charlotte, everybody in general,
and  Florestan in particular.

She could not forgive this latter for loving her.
She treated him more coldly every day, and yet he
did not seem to love her less. She could not understand
it, and at such times invariably wondered if
Claremont still cared for her. Her former lovers
passiveness was more galling then she had ever
dreamed his hatred could be. Did he love Lady
Mildred ? No  she was sure he did not. Women
have only to spend ten minutes in the society of a
man and his wife, of a lover and his mistress, to
know which is the one to love. When a man loves
a woman, he instinctively wants to touch her  her
hair, her shoulder, her hand, or a fold of her garment ;

and the merest nothing tells his passion to all the
air around him. Long before he comes near her
some occult power draws him slowly but surely to
her. This moral expansiveness is the expression of
the finest spiritual, not material, feeling, and says
more for the parity of a man's affection than could
a volume of the most eloquent words. The natural
instinct of the soul is a finer, subtler sense than the
natural instinct of the heart, and in men it is infallible,
whether shown by the King towards his
favourite maid of honour, or the humble student
towards his Latin-Quarter grisette.

And when women love ? Ah ! they may have as
many spiritual and natural instincts, but they are
more varied, and much more difficult to define.
Woman may not knoAV her own heart, but she can
tell directly what lies in another woman's. Enilda
felt that if there were any passion in this case it was
all on Lady Mildred's side.

She knew it was wrong, wholly wicked and detestable,
yet she longed to break the icy barrier between
Claremont and herself; loosed to see him once
betrayed out of that calm which he wore with such
constant, unchamino- grace. Then she thought :

*' He does not care ; he does it to madden me ; but
I will show that I can be more indifferent still."

So the days wore on, and nothing was changed.

If possible, there was only more calm; but experienced
mariners know when the sea looks like a o-reat
plain of oil, the smoother it seems to-night the
fiercer the tempest tomorrow. Enilda, for all she
had bought experience with sorrow, was still as
unversed in many of the world's signs and warnings
as dien she plucked the flower which grew so wild
in the little old Laramie garden. She realized that
Florestan loved her, worshipped her, and in the
tumult of her heart she often surprised herself,
wondering why she treated him so coldly  why she
did not give him in return one-tenth the affection
he GO generously bestowed ; yet her wonderment
finished there. She cried bitterly to herself that no
man was worth a woman's pure, honest affection ;
she took up her life in its glittering skein, became
daily more worldly, and tried to stifle in society's
distractions her present, and best thoughts, those
which had been bought with the price of her youthful
hopes and inestimable youthful illusions.

Enilda was thinking of this one afternoon, when
she was interrupted by a visitor  none other than
Florestan himself. Flora and Lucy had gone out
shopping, and for the first time, so to speak, since
their arrival in London, she found herself alone.
When the servant announced Mr. Florestan, her first
thought was to say, " Not at home ; " but on reflection

she decided to receive him. He came in with so
bright a smile that some way it seemed to lighten
up even her own gloomy feelings. " What ! " ho
said, " alone  I am lucky ! " Then he kissed her
hand tenderly.

Alone ! " she re-echoed. " I am so glad you came
in; I was boring myself to death thinking of 
myself."

He looked anxiously in her face, but he could not
make his eyes sad ; some way they were filled with a
merry humour.

Gaze upon me," he said ; " I don't appear like
the orthodox classical Hermes, but I am a modern
Mercury, and bring you messages infinite, from at
least four very important persons."

Enilda smiled. " Come and sit down," she said,
leading him to a favourite corner, "and let me hear
your news."

'first' he said, "a letter from your father, who
misses you, but is well and very happy."

Ah," she said ; " dear papa !  that is indeed good
news ;  and next ? "

Next," he said, " a letter for you from Cyril
written by his own hand."

"No!" she cried; 'give it to me this very
minute." She held out her hand. He gave her a
very small square of paper, rose-coloured, with a

tiny monogram in the corner, and an enormous bird
with an outstretched scroll in its beak. On this sheet
of paper were written the words :

To my dearest Miss 'Nilda, who I love very much,
and send all my love to at once. My terrier was lost
Ipr three days, and a wicked boy round the corner said
if 1 ever see him any more it would be in a sausage.
I miss you very much, and miss my father. I've had
my hair cut; and this winter, granny says, I'm to
wear pants. I love you very much, and wish you
were here to be my mother.

With great respect, truly yours,

Cyril Florestan."

Don't say my child isn't a wonder," said he
when she had finished reading ; "and  and the last
part of it."

Enilda blushed and looked down. "You have not
told me the rest of your news," she said. He bit his
lip, and an expression of sadness overclouded his
face.

You are right," he said calmly. " The rest is 
well, I shan't keep you in suspense  Miss Chandos-
Cressy has arrived, and so has Professor Protoplasm.
I've just come from Lady Mildred's and witnessed
the meeting, the first meeting between aunt and
niece."

*' You don't say ! What was it like ? "

Like ! Well, it was most curious ; it was like
nothing else I have ever seen in my life. You
know I'm not much of a gossip; but, shall I tell
you all about it ? "

She nodded a bright affirmative.

I'm not betraying any confidence, so I think I
may tell you exactly what happened. I was lunching
at Allison House ; Lady Mildred was showing me
some new plants, when we looked up, and at the
open door of the conservatory saw  Miss Chandos-
Cressy. She stood there  "

For Heaven's sake ! "

Yes ; wasn't it odd ? You know  Lady Mildred
had never seen her; she had been shown by mistake
into Claremont's room, he recognized her, and sent
her in as a surprise to his wife, wondering how Lady
Mildred would take the apparition. She turned
pale and grasped my arm. ' Who can it be ? ' she
ejaculated in an altered voice; then the apparition,
leaning on her ebony cane, said, ' Don't you know
me ? I'm your great-aunt and namesake, Mildred
Chances-Cressy.' "

What a surprise 1 Why how on earth did she
take it?"

"Take it; she took it as the little joker takes the
right bower in euchre. She went up to her, and

held out both hands, but seemed somewhat in doubt
where to kiss her, till looking over Miss Chandos-
Cressy's shoulder she saw her husband smiling: she
cried, ' Oh, John ! ' Then all three burst into a
scream of laughter, and they hugged and kissed all
round. It was very funny, I assure you. You know
Lady Mildred is an awfully good sort, not a bit like
a stiff Englishwoman, so she got on tremendously
well with her American great-aunt, and when I left
they were talking thirteen to the dozen "

"And you've no more news," said Enilda slily.

No ; but I've a favour to ask."

Well, what is it ? "

You once promised to play something for me ;
will you do it now ? "

Enilda breathed a half-sigh of relief. At that
moment the footman announced, " Professor Protoplasm."
In his heart Florestan condemned him to
the nethermost regions, but Enilda welcomed him
with a cordiality that bordered on enthusiasm. She
shook both his hands, and asked him a dozen questions
in a breath. Was he well ? Had he had a
pleasant voyage ? Were there any nice people on
the steamer ? He had come with Miss Chandos-
Cressy  quite shocking. Had he seen her papa
lately?  and how long was he going to stay in
London ?

Professor Protoplasm seemed to say yes to everything.


Let me give you some tea," she said, then added
in a stage aside : " I don't dare say a cock-tail ; this is
England you know  straight laced England."

The Professor smiled as he seated himself, and
drew from his pocket a gorgeous silk handkerchief,
with which he wiped his lined and unusually moist
forehead.

'Til have some tea," he said ; '' I'm devoted to tea.
isn't it odd, speaking of that plant, that although
it possesses such stimulating qualities, we, the
English-speaking races of to-day, drink it as freely
as we do water. Of course this taste has grown and
strengthened, a sort of an inheritance handed down
for generations, I should say. We could drink quarts
of tea and it would have no effect upon us ; but I
have every reason to believe that if William the
Conqueror were here to-day, and drank a single cup,
as strong as we drink it, it would knock him down
lifeless, if not stone dead, upon the pavement."

Enilda raised her hands in holy horror.

Happily," she said, " no tea was sprung on him
at the time of the Conquest, or  where would we all
be now ? "

"Tis a serious thing to think of," continued the
Professor, "and yet the question is a very simple

one  to think that perhaps the whole glorious Conquest
depended at one time upon William taking or
noi taking a cup of tea."

I don't know about taking tea," said Enilda ;
' but if we are to believe history he took matilda
by the hair of her head, and, to quote Charlotte,
ranked ' her from her house into the very streets
of Dives before a whole assembled populace."

Are you sure ? " said Florestan. " I never heard
of that ; and where on earth is Dives ? "

Ah ! Mr. Florestan," said the Professor, " you
won't mind my saying it, but the Avorld is very
ignorant. Few people have heard of Dives ; but those
who have not only heard of but seen it, can never
forget it; then, too, I have another reason ever to
remember it;  but was I interrupting you when I
came in ? What were you doing ? "

Doing ! " said Florestan, " I was begging Miss
Rozen to play for me. Long as I have known her,
she has never yet given me that pleasure. I had
almost prevailed upon her just as you entered."

Let me add my entreaties," said the Professor.

Very well," said Enikla, " I promise. Let us have
tea first, and then you will regret you ever said play
to me ; however, I shall make one condition. Professor
that you tell us your special reason for remembering
Dives. Ah ! here's the tea ; shall I play first,

or will you tell the story whilst we are having tea ?
Which shall it be, Mr. Florestan ? "

The story by all means," and sipping his favourite
beverage, the Professor began.

It isn't much of a story," he said, " and it happened
just one jear ago. I was staying at Trouville, where
I met American friends staying in the same hotel.
One fair man, who was accompanied by a lady of
great beauty, came up to me, and finding me
disengaged insisted on my dining with him and
his party at Dives, in the house of William the
Conqueror."

* Do you know the lady ? ' he said. I confessed
my ignorance, but added how proud I should be to
know a person of such surpassing loveliness. He
then introduced me to Mrs. Haller, and we were soon
bowling over the smooth roads leading to the little
fishing village of Dives, which claims the honour of
having given birth to William the Conqueror. The
house he is said to have been born in is still standing.
It is a quaint old inn or hostelry, and in one
threat room there is a mammoth chimney-place, and
on a brick of one of the panels is scratched the names
of Matilda and William'*

I wonder how many times that brick has been
renewed since 1300," said Florestan, putting more
sugar into his tea.

The Professor looked severe. " I have every
reason to believe it to be the original tile, and would
not insult history by casting reflections on that
battered but time-honoured relic. But to continue.
After we had looked at everything in the house,
peered out u23on street and courtyard from the little
diamond-paned windows, dined at a rickety table
off ancient and no less rickety pottery, Mrs. Haller
suggested we should inspect the rear of the cottage,
and take coffee at the little tables in the back courtyard.
No sooner said than done ; when we got
there, seeing a rustic vine and flower-clad balcony
running the whole length of the house she clapped
her hands together and said, ' Oh, girls, what an ideal
balcony for Juliet ! ' Then she sprang up the quaint
staircase, leaned over an arching buttress, cried out,
Mr. Malcolm, you be Romeo ; ' and before one could
realize what it was all about, she struck an attitude,
and stretching forth the jewelled hands began, *0h
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo ? ' I can
see her before me now as she stood there then, and
were I to live a thousand years could never forget
the picture ;  the twilight just fading into night ;
the little low house; the vine-clad balcony; the
grim courtyard with a hostler's lamp  just one  lit
up, and shining through a chink of the barn; and a
woman, the most beautiful I had ever seen, leaning

VOL. III. D

against a little trellis one mass of rich blossom,
matchless frame to her own matchless beauty, speaking
those incomparable words in her own incomparable
voice. I'm not given to remember wdiat
women wear, but I remember well what she wore. A
dress of palest yellow silk floated after her, and
seemed to lose itself in the amber-hued leaves on the
house wall; it was cut in a piece from her neck
down, and the shoulders were a mass of Indian muslin
and rare lace. A large Leghorn flat covered her
head, and two pale plumes floated down her back,
mingling their gold with the auburn of her tawny
hair. A knot of amber ribbon and deep red roses
fastened an old-fashioned girdle, and a fan of yellow
feathers swung lightly from a rich chatelaine at her
belt. She leant so gracefully, so idly, against her ,
that it seemed as if she were not only
a part of the balcony itself, but some gorgeous flower
bursting into bloom amidst those other flowers, one
and all master-pieces from great nature's hand. She
seemed utterly oblivious to our presence, but went
on and on in an inspired measure, which sent strange
thrills all over me. She never moved from her first
seemingly unconscious position. One jewelled hand
was slightly upraised, whilst the other, firmly imbedded
in the festoons of the balcony, clutched a
handkerchief of priceless lace between its fingers.

After ' what's in a name ? ' she changed her posture

to one, if possible, of still rarer grace, she went on

and on, and finally breaking into a shriek of laughter,

seized her girdle-knot and threw it full into Mr.

Malcolm's face, crying  "

Ah ! " cried Enilda ; " and you did not know, you

dii not guess  why, she was Adeline Nilsson." The

Professor wiped his brow.

** Yes," he replied quietly. " It broke upon me all

at once, and you may imagine whose hand led the

applause ; but  "

But what ? " said Florestan.

There's a sequel to the story," he added sadly ;

I must tell you that. The next night she left
Trouville, and as we all said good-bye at the Thence
Hotel in Paris, she seemed strange and wild. Malcolm
left her with peculiar politeness, and that same
evening she fell ill. She was ill more than a month,
and once tried to kill herself by jumping from a
high window facing the new Opera ! No one could
ever find the reason of her madness until she finally
told it. ' My heart is broken,' she said ; ' I felt it
breaking on that night I recited Juliet at Dives, and
the next day my only friend abandoned me.' She
said, ' I felt the strings snap then ; I will get over it,
but I shall never really love again.' She got over
it, and even had an unexpected revenge. A year

D 2

later she was playing an engagement in America, in
say Cincinnati  and coming down the steps of
the hotel, on her way to perform Juliet, saw a
familiar face behind the glass entrance-doors. It
was our old friend Malcolm, reduced from passion to
poverty, and from swelling style in the Grand at
Trouville to sweeping out hotel-bars in * The Queen
City ' of America."

"Well, I never!" cried Flora, suddenly appearing
on the scene. "I know servants give themselves
such airs in Cincinnati that they won't sweep out
offices, so I suppose now and then the clerks and
proprietors have to. I hope she played Juliet well
that night, however, if she never did before. Don't
stir. Professor ; I have been at the door listening to
the Avhole of your tale, and would have wept, but
the end was too  prosaic. Lucy's gone up-stairs ;
she'll be here in a minute. I'm tired to death ; do
give me some tea."

The Professor was staring silently at Flora.

Prosaic ! " he repeated ; " and yet they say
vengeance is a pleasure of the gods.' "

"Undoubtedly, when it is a personally directed
affair," said Enilda ; " and"

"My dear," interrupted Flora, "don't mention
gods or goddesses, nor immortals  but us poor
mortals. I too shall quote poetry :

' Hark ! what light through yonder window breaks ?
It is a fog, and London is the town.' "

No," said a chorus of voices. " No ; it was so fine
an hour asjo. A foot  a real foot ? "

Yes  yes  yes ; and  yellow. By the way, how
could Shakespeare ever have seen such a dawn in
England ? I've never struck such an one."

Enilda explained. " He didn't see it in England ;
he saw it in Juliet ; and  "

Florestan got up.

"There is no longer any excuse," he said; "your
eyes said, ' and I will play you something from that
Opera.' "

She went to the piano. Lucy came in dragging
the Count with her, and after hasty mutual greetings
Enilda's fingers executed the usual up and down preliminaries,
and she began an arrangement from the
old Bellini and Vacaj's dual score, going from ' Ove
sei tu E-omeo,' to the grand finale of the second act ;
thence to the still greater page where Romeo arrives
at the tomb, and finds his bride in her last mortal
resting-place.

Enilda played as she had never before played,
and one by one her guests fell into the spirit of her
reverie.

Were they in London ? Was a yellow fog creeping
over the earth ? was it five of a June day ?  or were

they in old Verona, and was the last sleep stealing
over " this palace of dim night ? " Was daylight
gone out into " inauspicious stars," was Juliet lying
on her placid bier, and Romeo singing in that
divinest of all inspirations, "Ah, se tu dormi,
seveglia ti ? "

"There was the old house in this city of the
Recent; the deep garden where a thousand flowers
were in bloom, and vines loaded with the reckless
wealth of a "vvhole summer's grape ; there was a lowly
arbour at the foot of a serpentine walk, and underneath
this arbour, standing beside a stone sepulchre lighted
by midnight stars, was that young lover upon whose
fair head the last star had set. Then came a rustling
amongst the vines, an incautious footstep, a hurried
altercation, one long wailing sob  that of a soul
precipitated before its Maker. The sad sighing of
the night-wind, the breath of a despairing lover, ashe
drinks from the imperial chalice, drinks, and 
Juliet awakes."

For Heaven's sake, stop ! " cried Florestan ; '' I
can hear no more. You have filled me with such
a presentiment of evil that  that  " He stopped
abruptly, in spite of himself a prey to violent
emotion.

Enilda looked up wonderingly, whilst her fingers
still held down the keys of that last chord. Her

face was whiter than her white hands, or the ivory
enamel which gleamed from the oaken case.

Flora got up.

I should think so," she said, " and I propose  "

"What?"

That we all go to the Hay market to-night and
see her play the part."

Florestan came back to the piano.

"The very thing," he said. "I am like a woman,
"Romeo and Juliet always breaks my heart, but I
can never forego revelling in the luxury of profound
sentiment. And as to her, Miss Flora, of course you
mean only one  "

The inexpressible she," interrupted Mrs. Chromo
laughing. " We'll send at once for a box, and if you
break up there to-night, my friend, we'll send you
back to New York by the next steamer." She was
looking steadily at Florestan as she spoke.

Somehow, no one could ever tell how, he was
beside Enilda, talking to her in a low voice. He
turned and smiled upon Lucy, but continued his
conversation with the former. Was she angry or
pleased with his words ? Evidently angry, for her
face flushed and her manner expressed anything but
pleasure. She left the piano hastily.

Nonsense," she said, " you know I cannot answer
now.' '

Flora looked up.

"My dearest Florestan," she said, "pardon the
frankness of an early friend, but  but I believe you
are making love to Enilda. Confess, is it so ? "

The Professor stared. What had happened ? He
was in Dives, looking at a beautiful woman on a
vine-clad balcony. Love ! What did Miss Grayson
mean ? What could she be talking about ?

Florestan came bravely forward.

"I always make, love to her," he said, "every
chance I get; and just then  "

Just then," mimicked Flora. " Suppose we all
retire."

But Enilda wouldn't hear of that. Suddenly she
smiled and said brightly :

"You are a privileged person, Mr. Florestan, and
you know I couldn't endure a man who had the
poor taste not to make love to me. Yes ; you may
accompany us to the Haymarket."

The party was made up, even to the Count, who
at that moment insisted on coming. The evening
was spent at the little old theatre, and never
had the lovely actress played better. Once, before
she came to the great potion scene, catching sight
of the Professor she stopped and put her hand suddenly
to her forehead. Was she too thinking of the
past  of the home of William the Conqueror  and a

page in her life Avhicli lie never had dared nor cared
to repeat ?

Fiorestan and Enilda both noticed her france and

o

expression. The latter seemed some way to reflect
itself on Enilda's hitherto calm face, and until
the end of the play never wholly left her countenance.
The audience was roused to such a pitch
of enthusiasm as she had never before seen. Flowers
were hailed from. the front to the footlights. Lucy
and Flora were left without either courage or hand-bouquets,
and Enilda not alone divested herself of
her fairest roses, but unclasping a bracelet from
her arm, flung it with her lace handkerchief so
straight that it dropped fairly at the actress's feet.
She was too impressed for words, and too much
moved when the performance was concluded to quite
realize that it was all over, and they must return
home. She got up in a dazed sort of way, and only
when the fair Juliet came before the curtains again
and again to bow her acknowledgment, could she
seem to recollect what it was all about.

Florestan said nothing, but his fine face was overshadowed
as Enilda had never before seen it. Flora's
voice kept rippling forth as they made their way
from the theatre. Her eulogia was something to
make the accepted vocabulary of adjectives turn
pale for very incompleteness.

It's all right, because Shakespeare wrote it," she
said ; " but have two people ever died like that for
love ? "

"I don't know about two," said Enilda; "but 
but  " She hesitated.

Don't mention it," said Flora. " Mr. Florestan
seems determined to be your companion in everything.
If you can't hit it off single, I should say
the Blackfriars bridge isn't much out of our way
the night is dark  stars  out of the Haymarket
at a premium  and  "

"There are two plays which always affect me
strangely," interrupted Enilda irrelevantly ; " one
is  well, this one, and the other is, ' La Dame aux
Camels,'  I can never see them too often."

"My dear," said Flora quickly; "you can hear
Nilsson or Patti, or  or that American girl in the
Traviata ' tomorrow if you like. Then there is
another nice cheerful piece on at the Strand, same
style, where buckets of tears fall nightly ; but shall
it be"

' Traviata/ " said Enilda laughing. " Mr. Florestan,
shall you be free ? "

My life is one long rendez-vous," he said ; " or
rather rendez-moi, and naturally you may dispose of
it and me. Which theatre shall it be, and which
star ? "

The Count, who had scarcely spoken during the
Avhole evening, lifted up a warning finger, for he
noticed that Florestan was about making a mem. on
his shirt-cuffs.

My dear sir," he said, " that we will never allow.
This is not New York. And ' Traviata '  the artists ?
bah ! it doesn't much matter ; they all begin by
singing ' Traviata ' at Covent Garden, and end by 
by acting it in the Haymarket."

CHAPTER III.

It was the first day of Ascot. Flora was in a
state of indescribable excitement, Lucy Chromo ina
flutter over her dress, and Enilda pursued by a
train of vague thought inexplicable to herself, and
undesirable to any one preparing for the delights
of the great races.

"Enilda," cried Flora, "come and help me write'
this note. It's to Baron d'Alfredi ; he says races
are almost out of his line ; but if I reminded him
the very day, hour, and minute of our departure
he might turn up. What shall I say to him ? "

Say  oh, say anything."

Shall I write to him in the first or third person.
I rather prefer the third. I have got as far as this.
Listen :

' Miss Grayson presents her most distinguished
compliments to Baron d'Alfredi, and begs to tell

him that she is very well, very much obliged for his
beautiful flowers, which shall be worn on her breast
this very morning ; and I do hope you won't forget
that you promised to come to Ascot the first day 
that is to say if I let you know myself; and we are
croinor now, this very minute.

' Always yours sincerely,

'flora Grayson.'

Well, what do you think of it ? "

Enilda was absent-minded : she replied :

Why, it reads all right. Do you care about his
coming ? "

Yes I do ; he's too sweet."

And Mr. Pastor ? "

Pastor ? my dear child, when a man loves you to
that extent it becomes laborious. Life is a struggle.
I rnioht as well be a washerwoman livings in Turk's
Row, with eleven small children on my hands to look
after, and this  this is affection. I'm fond of him,
so I am of chocolate, but I don't live on chocolate asa
steady diet, do I ? "

Enilda agreed that she did not.

So of course I must vary my existence somewhat
with the society of other men."

My dear Flora, do you intend to marry young
Pastor or not ? "

*' Yes, yes ; I suppose I do in time."

'' Then why treat him so ? "

Why do you treat Ythan Florestan so ? '

Enilda blushed.

The case is not the fame."

Oh yes, it is ; he adores you, and you like him just
as much as I do Pastor. I really think, Enilda, that
John Claremont is more in your line. I believe hein
love with you. What a pity he's already married !
I like Lady Mildred; she's a real trump, but he 
dark, silent, unsmiling, or smiling frigidly  "

Flora, stop, how can you ? "

Thanks, Miss Rozen," said a voice at Enilda's
elbow. She started violently, for John Claremont
stood beside her.

Thanks," he continued ; " what have I done, Miss
Flora, to deserve such a character at your hands ? "

Enilda turned pale with annoyance. How much
of Flora's chatter had he heard ; how much ?

Flora laughed.

Well, it's the truth ; you know it is. Did you hear
me say  well, what were the first words you heard ?
confess."

He smiled gravely.

The first were : ' I like Lady Mildred ; she's a real
trump, but  ' "

Ah ! no more ; nothing before that ? "

Nothing."

He laid a hand mockingly on his heart.

Ah ! ' 'Tis well, Horatio.' Enilda, isn't it nearly
time to start ? I am going to put on my things."

Mr. Clare mont, what do you think of her dress
and mine ? Which do you prefer ? Now look well
at us both, and then decide."

She stood him off at arms-length.

He put a hand distractedly to his forehead.

How can I ?  both are so perfect. The one I
decide against I  "

Oh, you make an enemy for life of the other,"
Flora interrupted. " Beware of me." Flora tapped
him cheerily on the shoulder.

Nonsense," she continued ; " speak out like a
man. Say that Enilda's is the sweetest, prettiest,
most adorable gown, and that in it she is"

The prettiest, sweetest, most adorable woman,"
cried another voice. Then the Count came forward,
superb in racing flannels, holding a bouquet of white
roses which he presented to Enilda with elaborate
ceremony.

She took them with thanks, but turned paler than
their waxen petals.

Claremont looked at her for one moment, then he
went towards her.

You are ill," he said ; " what is it ? "

She was turning her flowers in her hand, and
made him no answer. There was an angry pain in
her heart. How calm he was,  how cold ! At last
she knew that she was nothing to him.

"Girls, I am going to put on my things," cried
Flora, "and send this note to the Baron. I'll be
back in a moment, then we can all start off. I must
hunt up Lucy too, or she'll be late. "

May I come too, Miss Flora ? "

The Count was calling out to her through the
opened door; but her voice answered ringing down
the staircase as her heels rang up :

"Come!  I should think not; but Til kiss Lucy
for you in the "  her voice was getting higher and
higher  "in the  mean time."

Count," said Claremont, " may I have one of
your flowers ? Miss Rozen, won't you offer me a
rose in  in the mean time ? "

He went nearer to her this time and looked
straight into her eyes.

Just one," he murmured ; " one for old times'
sake."

Her heart bounded, and as if in a vision she saw
the old garden at Laramie ; the moon on the water ;
she heard the rushes sing under the bridge, and
the cry of the toad who sent one long flute-like
note through the still air; she heard a man's

voice say "for ever," felt a kiss on her cheek,
and 

"No," she cried sharply, "I cannot."

The Count came forward.

This," he said, " is a compliment I never expected
; you refuse to give one of my flowers to
another man ? "

Claremont looked up with glittering eyes.

Enilda remarked their light; in an instant her
attitude changed.

Ah, Count, that idea alters the case ; now I
must give him one "  she tendered Claremont the
bouquet ;  " will you choose yourself ? "

Thanks, no ; you must choose for me, and  give
it me."

She selected the most perfect flower and handed
it to him. By this time she had almost recovered
her composure.

"Permit me,"  she looked him full in the face.
I will even decorate you myself."

Then she fastened the rose in his button-hole ;
and he  he bent his head and kissed her hand, at
the same time murmuring :

Flora was right. I have never changed ; I can
stand it no longer ; I must see you alone."

Enilda staggered backwards.

"Oh!" she gasped,  "oh!" Then in spite of

VOL. HI. E

herself a look of triumph darkened her eyes and
lit up her face to a hitherto unknown brightness.
"Oh!"

Sh  ! " he murmured, and turned quickly aside.
Another head appeared in the doorway. "Mr.
Florestan," he muttered, then he gave her a hasty
glance which said, " I know all ; he loves you," and
went to the window ostensibly to look out on the
street.

Florestan came up to Enilda. "Ah," he said,
looking at the Count briefly, "some one has outwitted
me. I too had brought some flowers." He
held a small parcel in his hand.

Enilda smiled recklessly; what mattered now she
knew the truth ? She would wear all which might
be given her.

"Thanks," she cried gladly, "you know I love
flowers, and these are  "

John Claremont came from the window and held
out a hand to Florestan.

"These are your favourites," cried the latter,
shaking hands with Claremont. " Lily of the valley
and white roses." He was so happy that he scarcely
noticed Claremont, whose face was gathering into a
dark cloud, and whose eyes began to burn with a
dangerous light.

The Count came forward.

"You must also decorate Mr. Florestan," he said
blandly, "not with one of my flowers, but  one of
his own."

Again the reckless smile came over Enilda's face.
"Quite right," she cried. "Here is a white rose
in  in remembrance of one which Cyril sent me 
long ago. Ah,"  Flora came in with Lucy,  " is
it time to go ? " She was fastening the rose into
Florestan's coat. " Then I must put on my things.
Excuse me one moment and I will be back directly."
Before Florestan could more than look this gratitude
she had flown from the room, and Mrs. Chromo's
voice was trilling out as clear as a cricket's ; chirping
about Ascot, the Royal Enclosure, the Royalties,
the luncheon, the horses, the house Lady Mildred
had taken at the Heath, the weather, the races ;
whether or no it would rain ; and what a too heavenly
time she intended to have.

John Claremont looked at Florestan, and the
latter looked at him ; neither spoke, but Claremont
smiled a bitter smile," and then turned again
towards the window.

"The horses are oettincr restless," he said. "I
think I'll run down and wait for you on the box."

Oh, we are all ready now," cried Flora ; " let's go
out together. Enilda's coming along directly, and
Mr. Pastor"

E 2

** Mr. Pastor is here ! " cried out that youth.
Here, and  and he brings you some flowers."

Well, I never ! " cried Mrs. Chromo ; " this is
quite like a fete in the Botanical Gardens."

' Isn't it curious' said Flora, sniffing her bouquet
violently, " that Englishmen and foreigners never
give a lady flowers ? Now in New York, if a man
don't send a lady a bouquet, leave it with his card
the very day after she's introduced to him, why, she
thinks he doesn't know the usages of decent society."

But I  I was an apt pupil ! " cried Pastor
delightedly. " I did exactly that."

"Well, naturally, after I had nearly hinted my
head off the night before. You see I liked you,"
Flora added with adorable candour. " I was awfully
afraid you'd be found lacking, and the thing I never
would have overlooked would have been that very
thing. So when I saw the flowers  oh 1 here's Euilda ;
now I suppose we nay be off."

Pastor slipped an arm through Flora's. Then
they made their way laughing into the street. There
was some demur about seating them all.

"Everybody wants to be beside everybody else,"
cried Enilda. " What shall we do ? "

At last it was settled. She was placed beside
Claremont. Florestan sat near, whilst Mrs. Chromo
and the Count sat side by side. They were to pickup

Lady Mildred on the way, and the party would
be complete.

Enilda now almost feared a tete-astute with her
old lover. She could scarcely realize what he had
said a little while ago. Was it true he had not forgotten
her ? But now that he had told her of the
fact in so many words, her heart grew alternately
light and heavy with apprehension. See him alone ?
No ; that she would never do. What could he say
to explain the past ? what that could change their
present ? The assurance that he still loved her,
suddenly became a care, a responsibility, which
leaded her will and damped her splits. She feared
another disclosure, and felt her heart leap into her
mouth as she took her seat beside him ; yet one
look at his face might have reassured her. It was
grave, calm, impassive as ever; and later, as she
dared to look at him, he was so cool, so matter-of-fact,
that she wondered if he had really told her he
was unchanged, or if she had dreamt it.

His talk was not of an amorous turn. He spoke
of his horses, of a favourite mare who had broken
her knees, and said that the right leader was a
spirited beast; he hoped he wouldn't give him trouble;
Then they picked up Lady Mildred, who took her
place beside Florestan; and in a few moments
London, with its unpoetic rows of working-men's

houses, its solitary church spires looming up now
and then amidst the monotony of brown tiles and
brick facings, even its outskirts were left far behind.
The smoke of a distant city still floated mist-like
over the moor ; and the sky, now and then breaking
into patches of opaline blue, told them that they
were really away from the great Babylon ; away into
the country, where men's souls are not always like
the skies  clearer, but where they seemed to be in
contrast with what they had left behind.

Flora, Lucy, Pastor, and Lady Mildred kept up a
constant chattering; Florestan was too engrossed
with his own happiness to speak. He was thinking
about the rose she had given him, and her own
reference to Cyril's flower. Why had she spoken
of it if it had not been a pleasant remembrance ?
The very first opportunity he determined to ask
her to marry him, and this time surely she would
not misunderstand.

At last they reached Ascot Heath. The road for
some way back had been one brilliant line of drags
and carriages, filled with richly-dressed women,
pretty girls in smart toilettes, wearing veils which
floated away from chip hats, like happy clouds in a
summer sky. A light dust arose like a vapour from
a hot bath, flashing eyes glanced into other eyes;
the ready " Halloa ! " and mirthful " How are you ? "

were flung to passing acquaintances, while the confused
clamour of a thousand voices  laughing, chatting,
jesting, or singing all in one, made the air
resound to the echo of good humour, as it resounds
to the rappel of martial music. There were organs
by the wayside ; pianos, harps, and guitars without
number; dancing men in black and white, zingaras
from Granada, and zitellas from Naples ; flower-girls
from Paris, and orange-girls from Seviglia; pale
frauleins from Holland, and swarthy thanes from
Hungary. There were white-aproned models from
Rome, with dark brows and bead-bespangled collars ;
monkey-like Sicilians with crafty almond eyes, and
the coloured soiled stays which forms a corselet over
their chemise-bodies. There were Italian babes, like
the Sistine cherubs, stretching out unformed hands,
which like their unformed tongues still managed to
articulate  money, not to mention the orthodox
beggar who constantly begs, and as constantly appears
with new offspring at her prolific breast.
There were minstrels, whose colour changed with
their song, and who twanged banjos with immoderate
hand and all too moderate skill, urchins who
threw missiles at passers-by, and responsive objects
which were hurled back from over-crowded carts ;
whilst not unfrequent oath exploded like a rocket
in the air.

Finally a band struck up at a distance ; outriders
with their chargers pranced along the open ; there
was a wild cry from the crowd, which was hurled
deep down, and brought as high up again in every
throat : " There they come  there are the Royalties."
Claremont had barely time to w!]eel out of the way,
when a noble pageant lighted the heath anew with
colour, and the heir-apparent, with his all too lovely
consort, was seen bowing and smiling? from the
depths of his frank eyes  bowing here, there, everywhere,
upon his friends and future subjects. The
crush of the crowd to get a sight of him was something
truly incredible. It was as if they had never
before seen a Royal personage. The air was filled
With cries.

*' Ah ! that's the Princess ; isn't she lovely ? "
*' Oh, she smiled on me ; " and another  " No ; it was
me. She bowed right at me." Then more disputing
and shrieking ; applause from enthusiastic souls ; more
cries  " That's Lady so-and-so  did you see her ?
Isn't she too sweet ! " and an infinity of similar
expressions all truly unique and appropriate, only
to be heard on a typical race-course within the
confines of Her Majesty's typical domain.

Enilda, Flora, and Mrs. Chromo had never seen
anything like this before, and their vocabulary of
complimentary adjectives was soon exhausted.

As they wished to see everything, the drag was
stationed with other drags, aud the urtj soon found
themselves on the hewn outside the tribune, where
men were anon rushing to the telegraph-office ; anon
tearing over the turf, rushing to the grand stand ;
shaking hands with friends here, there, everywhere ;
drinking a glass of champagne from over the ledge of
some Maecenas's box, and discussing the jockeys as
they came from the paddock. One was pale, another
flushed ; one looked tired, another triumphant. Then,
there were the horses and the races, and the odds and
the owners. Some had seen the Duke of Tyburn ;
he seemed solemn. Perhaps Fairy was lamed. It
was a well-known fact that she had refused good half-and-half
after her last trial the day before ; perhaps
Shrimp had sold her out. It was a put-up job.
Shrimp was a known scoundrel. Another would win
the race, etc. etc. There was her Grace of Ormond
walking with her jockey ; she looking very anxious,
he certainly very angry. There was a Prince of
the blood talking confidentially with a book-maker ;
and my lady Garfield, white as a sheet, leaning
on my lord's arm, drinking a brandy-and-soda, and
talking' with a voice as hoarse as a rook's cawing.
There were crowds, and crowds, and crowds; and
Enilda noticed that they never ran twice up against
the same people. The Anglo-saxon physiognomy

was certainly predominant, and the conversation, if
witty, was certainly not without a certain monotony
of expression. At one time everybody seemed
saying " 'Pon me word;" at another, thousands
of "Really nows" broke on the air; and at
another, as at a given signal a whole tableau
became yellow in a pantomime, so every mouth
seemed to utter with one breath, " You don't
say so?"

Flora was enchanted, and Mrs. Chromo's delight
knew no bounds. After they had gone over every
part of the ground they went to the Royal Enclosure,
and paid a visit to the pavilion, where the Court
stood or sat like a cluster of flowering vines on a
garden wall. Enilda, as usual, Alas especially honoured
with II. R. H.'s attention. She strolled over the
peruse with him ; she talked horse to the best of
her ability ; she nearly killed him with her Americanisms;
and they sometimes laughed so loudly
together, that vinegar-eyed prudes stared right
and left, and smooth-browed dowagers nodded little
malicious nods with their top-knots of flaky hair
in a distinct rhetoric, which seemed to say, '' You
see the audacity; those Americans will dare, will do,
will say anything."

Florestan stood at one side sulky and silent. He
was furious With Enilda. Why should she talk so

long or valk so long with His Highness ? His
American hood boiled.

Claremont, however, only laughed ; he thought it
great sport. " She amuses him," he said ; " you can't
tell what a pleasure it is to people who are tied down
to a rigid etiquette, who are accustomed to time-servers,
and subjects who dare not call their souls
their own, to now and then run across frank specimens
of a race who know no more than to consider
themselves everybody's equal ; who say what they
mean without fear ; who contradict a Royal Highness
if they see fit as they would a plain mister ; who have
their own opinions about people and things ; and who
do not hesitate to express them freely; dio treat
princes  "

Just as if they were human beings like ourselves,"
said Flora.

"And," continued Claremont, "who, by their simplicity
and non-affectation, pay the greatest compliment
they can to royal intelligences, ' one and all.' "

Bravo ! " said the Count, and " Bravo ! " said other
voices, as Lord and Lady St. Ermine and Baron
d'Alfredi came up towards them.

Oh, Baron d'Alfredi, here you are  of course you
got my note."

He tapped his breast lightly. " It shall be found
glazed and hung up before my inner temple."

Don't," said Pastor. " Inner temple reminds me
of briefless barristers and soulless solicitors. I am
the former ; and my best friend is the latter."

Flora interrupted irrelevantly :

Baron, which one do you bet on ? "

I  oh, I always take the field against the
favourites."

"But how are we to do that? You are just intime
for luncheon."

'thanks; it's easy enough; we must make up
some private pools. I am rather hungry."

Making up pools was no sooner said than done.
Between sandwiches, salads, shrimps, and champagne,
a respectable sum was collected ; the horses' names
were written on slips of paper, lots were drawn, and
luncheon went on uninterruptedly.

Enilda did not return ; she was honoured with
an offer to take food in the pavilion.

Nonsense," said Flora ; " why didn't she refuse ? "
But Eiiilda hadn't refused, and half-an-hour later
she was telling her experiences to her friends.

I am afraid I did dreadful things," she said.
When the princess got up and spoke to me I took
that moment to sit down : you see I felt kind of
tired, then Countess d'Ammuuille,  you know that
American who married a French General  well, she
screamed out to me with a loud voice, quite over

everybody's head, ' You must stand when she speaks
to you;'  the screaming her idea of manners, you
see. I jumped up so quickly that I tipped over a
little table with flowers on it, and the vater ran allover
her Highness's dress. Then I got so nervous
that I fanned myself all the time she was talking tome,
and really heard the stick of my fan break in
her face. It was awful ; I don't know when I have
felt so uncomfortable before in the whole of my life."

The Baron laughed.

What a chapter of horrors ! " he said ; " but there
is nothing' to feel uncomfortable about. The things is
to have acted there as you would have acted in your
own home."

"Yes," added Enilda, smiling; "but I don't think
I would upset tables in my own home, any more
than I would fan myself and break the sticks of my
fan in any one's face.

Florestan was interested.

It was awkward," he said, " but you meant
to do everything quite right;" then added, "Here
I've been keeping this place for you. You must
have some luncheon."

He was interrupted by a violent clamour; bells,
shouting, screaming, and untold excitement.

Oh, the race, the first race ! " cried Lucy. Then
she jumped about, seized a glass, and looked long

and earnestly at some dozen slender animals shooting
alone: the track.

Which is my horse ?  I can't make him out."

I see mine' cried Flora.

Oh," said Enilda, " I can't tell one from the
other."

Then there was more bell-rinmno- more shouting ;
some names and figures run up on a tablet, and
all was over. A crowd of people then poured into
the track, swarmed up into the Royal Enclosure,
and stood with flattened noses against the rails, and
wide eyes staring through the fence, trying to get a
glimpse of the Royalties and distinguished heads
which so smartly went back and forth in the charmed
circle. Every one that passed in or out was gazed at
with sad but earnest gaze, and commented on in
that regretful way the English masses have when
speaking of or watching their ' upper ten ' on a race
day.

Flora turned to Lucy.

"I'm tickled to death at this," she said, as they
passed out of the gate leading on to the course. " I
suppose they take me at least for a Countess in
my own right. Look back at the enclosure, Lucy !
isn't it a sight ? It's as thickly dotted with Highnesses
as a meadow with daisies. This is too
heavenly  Baron, have I won ? "

The Baron smiled.

You have lost," he said cheerfully ; " but you may
have a better chance for the next race."

Lady Mildred had won the pool.

It's a pot of money," she said, when the stakes
were counted. " I  what shall I buy with it,
John ? "

Keep it," suggested Flora. Claremont shook his
head.

Buy a new dress of Worth," said Lucy Chromo.
Oh ! by the way, speaking of him, have you ever
seen his house at Serene near Paris ? "

A chorus of ' No ! no !  tell us about it," was her
answer.

It's perfectly wonderful, and bears the stamp of
a most original mind. I advise every woman who
has ever paid a long bill to see where her money
has finished. The house is a palace of about five
different piles; Versailles or Schonbrunn scarcely
equal it. There is one room a porcelain gallery, so
filled with plates incrusted in fluted columns or
pillars : so many that I wonder any are left for the
world to eat on. There is one room with portraits,
immense pictures, framed in double frames of
Venetian point only a quarter of a yard wide each
frame  "

Dear heaven, hear ! " said Enilda ; " and we poor

creatures who have felfc rich with one or two dress-panels,
a collar, perhaps cuffs of the rare work."

Oh, that's nothing ! Besides the frames there are
chairs and bed-spreads, and even table-cloths. The
hangings and tapestries would not disgrace an
Oriental palace. The hot-houses are princely. The
library is correct, beau ti full y-bound books, and some
old MS., with a floor of marqueterie. You know
that floor in the '67 Exhibition that no one could
afford to buy; well, he's bought it, and it was
so bio" that he had to take the roof off his house
and one wall down in order to get it in ; but there
it is, and these feet walked over it." Lucy Chromo
stretched out her Mayflower No. 2's in illustration.
But the new mansion in the garden, my dear, that
is amazing. Why, he's got all those fluted columns
that belonged to the Tuileries built up with brick
and beautiful marbles into such a fantastic creation."

Enilda lifted both hands.

What is it that you are surprised at  the
columns ? "

Oh no ; he began with the Tuileries ; it is but
just that he should end there."

Lucy smiled and continued :

"Oh, I don't think he's ended anywhere yet; and
the gardens  why, I never saw such gardens, such
style, such flowers. He's made a sort of staircase of

marble with three landings going up to the central
palace, with a wall to the left incrusted with  well,
guess-what ? "

"We never could guess," said D' Alfred! and
Florestan in a breath.

Oh, another historical trifle. All the bas-relief
medallions of the old Hotel de la Ville. What do you
think of that for classical research ? "

M. Worth is a genius," said Enilda. "I always
thought he was the most original man in the world ;
now I am sure of it. He alone shall be my future
dressmaker. What's that ? '*

A loud ringing of bells was heard.

Dear me, the next race ! " cried Flora. " I had
forgotten all about this being Ascot  and my bet."

Then there was a repetition of scrambling to seethe
horses, another hasty pool made up, another five
minutes of breath-holding, and all was over.

Flora this time bad won. She counted her money
with eminent satisfaction.

"I shall put it by," she said, "and spend it ti
dear New York ; that's where most of England's
guineas go now-a-days."

At last the races finished. Lauohino, chattering,

and occasionally shrieking with excitement, they

reached Lady Mildred's cottage. Dinner followed

tea. A band played in the gardens. Not a cloud

VOL. III. F

obscured the blue of the evening sky. There was a
dance in an old oaken gallery, and a walk on the
terrace at midnight, when heaven seemed one glittering
circle of jewels. Crowds of visitors had
dropped in, and Lady Mildred had to put up half-a-dozen
unexpected guests. She Alas equal to the
occasion, however, and even Enilda's eyes opened
wide on seeing this impromptu version of English
hospitality.

Neither Claremont nor FJorestan had seen Enilda
alone. Each waited for his turn to come, and each
waited that day in vain.

The last two figures to walk on the terrace were
those of Flora and Pastor.

He kissed her hand complainingly.

Nonsense !" she said; "jealous of the Baron.
Well you may be, however, but I fear he's not a
marrying man. I suppose, Willis, I must marry you
to  to get rid of you."

If you only would ; will you never give me an
answer ? "

'eyes, good-night; tomorrow,  tomorrow you
shall know your fate."

CHAPTER IV.

Ascot week was over ; Lady Mildred's guests were
dispersed ; and most of them back in town ready to
begin the okl treadmill of society.

Enilda was in a state of feverish excitement, atone
moment wildly gay, at another in a state of the
deepest despondency. She had not seen Claremont
alone, and had prettily baffled every effort of Flore stan's
to get a chance to speak to her in private. He
was not unhappy about this, however, as he some way
felt that she was no longer indifferent to him. He
saw her every day ; he could touch her hand, her
dress, a fold of her garment; could now and then
look into her eyes across a crowded dinner-table ;
perhaps meet her accidentally flitting along some
corridor ;  could give her a flower, or ask for one.
Then too, there was always Cyril to talk about. He
was an endless theme, and never failed to attract
and keep her attention. The hours slipped by, and

r F 2

yet Florestan did not seek to hurry events. He lived
in sweet security, and a certain dreamy unconsciousness
of the lapse of time. He said to himself:

I will not worry her ; I feel, I know, she must love
me. Perhaps she will be the first to let me know
that she will accept her fate. Perhaps that day will
come soon." Then he fell to dreaming again, and
built castles in the air like a school-girl who packs
her boxes to the happy tune, " This is my last term,
now for the future."

The following Monday there was to be a great
musicale at Baron d'Alfredi's. The Baron and
Enildawere almost neighbours; and the latter's house
in Park Lane was only removed from hers by a few
numbers. In fact Flora declared that she had been
the means of the acquaintanceship ; for she had
noticed the fair nobleman standing on his terrace of
a morning. They had exchanged looks across the
leads, and later when they had met at a party a
swift pact of friendship was concluded on the
spot.

The Baron was fair, handsome, agreeable, and
had a certain gentleness which was more like a
woman than a man. His eyes were blue, deep,
and soft ; his face was pale and overspread with an
habitual tired expression, which attracted every one's
immediate attention and sympathy. His features

were clear-cut and tired-looking ; his blonde whiskers
waved with an air of supreme indifference ; his
smile was soft and slow ; his laugh perfectly cadenced
but not contagious; when he smiled he exposed a
small mouth opening wearily over very white and
perfect teeth. His whole appearance was one of
extreme naturalness, extreme sensitiveness, extreme
nervousness, extreme gentlemanliness  but extreme
weariness.

Flora adored him. She told him as much on one
occasion, but he had laughed and said :

I am old enough to be your father ; just think
how proud I should be to be papa to such a pretty
child ; " but Flora wouldn't hear of that at all. She
alternately teased and tormented him. She asked
him the most personal questions, and one morning
invited herself to chip in to breakfast with him, in
order, as she said, to see every bit of his 'house, and
have him tell her all about it, which he did most
modestly ; declaring there was little to see, and
nothing at all to tell. By the time the day arrived
for the musical party, Flora could scarcely decide in
her mind which number in Park Lane she really
lived in  whether in Enilda's great mansion or in
the Baron's spacious and lovely home.

The morning of the party both the girls were
sitting with Lucy discussing their dresses  an endless

theme  and some invitations which they were about
to answer.

"Now," said Lucy, "just listen to this, and they
call English a language. Why, it's like the weather
in London  there's no climate, only samples. How
can one ever spell names rightly when they're. all
pronounced wrongly ? I'm going to spell every name
just as it sounds;  here you are to Miss Charley 
to Mrs. Beechen  to Mrs. Lesson-Gore, and to my
Lady Cooper ;  they'll go fast enough."

Why, Lucy, how queer ! Who would ever have
dreamed in dear America that Cholmondeley was
pronounced Charley ; Beauchamp, Beechen ;
Cowper, Cooper, and so on ? How did you find it
out ? "

The Count told me."

Seems to me you're very intimate with him,"
hazarded Enilda.

Lucy flushed.

I value his good opinion above that of all other
men," she said.

Have you ever told him so ? " said Enilda.

I didn't need to tell him," said Lucy courageously ;
a man of his superfine instinct could not but feel
the appreciation he is held in by every woman."

Flora and Enilda exchanged glances, but said
nothing. The morning was spent dawdling in the

Row ; lunching for a change at an Italian cafe, and
the afternoon at the Academy, where the President's
pretty women were duly admired; likewise Master
Tadema's Greek figures, classic alphonse, and natural
mosaics, and Millais's cherubs, which remind us of
the Breezes and Reynolds of the olden time. They
paid several calls, drank five cups of tea with
five different acquaintances, took a turn in the
Park, received callers between six and seven, dressed,
dined, and finally found themselves walking between
a row of correct lacqueys in the vestibule of the
Baron's very perfectly-ordered mansion.

The Baron was a man  a true man in every sense
of the word  and yet he was unlike other men. There
was a something womanish in his nature, which
betrayed itself not only in his person but in his
house. In the adornment of the rooms, in the
decoration of his furniture there was little evidence
of masculinity, but everywhere the touch of a
woman's hand. The mansion from cellar to garret
was distinguished by that aroma of daintiness which
usually is the sex's sole province. There was a refinement
and elegance in the smallest object which
bespoke his supersensitive nature, and fastidiousness
seemed as distinctly a part of his person as perfume
is a part of the rose.

On this particular occasion one recognized everywhere

this subtle odour of finality. One felt it in
the books and fragile bric-a-brac; in the pictures
which were hung on the walls; in the statuettes
and inlaid cabinets filled wdtli a thousand trifles
collected by a palm seemingly as delicate as Eve's
or fatal as Helen's ; in the tables heaped with costly
trinkets ; in the little brackets here and there,
holding vases carelessly filled with flowers, a blossom
hanging over the side perhaps, or a vine trailing
unconsciously on some tapestry cover; in a little
writing-desk in an out-of-the-way corner, whose wax
and seals, violet ink, crystal paper-weight, and torn
envelope, suggested some hastily-begun and as
hastily finished letter. There were divans, with lace
antimaccassars and monogrammcd cushions ; a footstool
peeping forth from the carved legs of an
easy chair, and a book open, with a paper-cutter
between its leaves ; there were numerous jewelled
frames enclosing innumerable fair faces ; miniatures
smiling forth from dark velvet backgrounds, anon
reposing on golden brackets, anon encrusted in
some dainty panel of the daintier walls; a piano
with ivory keys borrowed a deeper tint from the
pale marqueterie of its case, and a music-rack with
the sheets of music all awry, held a page of Costa's
j\rignon,' and Tost's ' Ti rapine,' folded in together,
as if a hasty voice had tried one after the other,

and thrown both aside with equal impatience. A
jardiniere of graceful palms in a corner cast tiickerin
shadows on the tinted walls ; a box of ferns and fine
grasses stood near an open window whose heavy
curtains were drawn aside, even the inner lace was
caught back with knots of amber ribbon; the
jalousies vere uplifted, and through one crystal
half-opened pane, the brightness of a starry night
gleamed on the white and green of a matchless
terrace, whose flowers, like an endless garden, lost
thei' verdure in the verdure of the Park beyond.
This light fell steady on the marble floor, graciously
adding its silvery radiance to the roseate tints
which streamed gently from the shaded waxen tapers
of the drawing-room.

As Enilda ami Flora went forward, they were
received by the Baron's sister and family doing the
honours of the evenings, whilst standing to her
right were Florestan, Lady Mildred, and her husband.
The rooms were already crowded ; the Prince had
just arrived, and the music just begun. There was
an incessant hum of polite chatter; a few brief
chords were heard on the piano ; and the notes of a
clear soprano beginning the inevitable ' Una voce
poco fa.'

The Count, who was just entering with Mrs.
Chromo on his arm, stopped suddenly.

Surely," he said to the Baron, " I know that
voice."

The Baron laughed gaily, and turned to Enilda.

A little surprise which I had planned for you.
We have Patti and Scalcbi, and numbers of other
singers, but I thought you would like to hear an
American soprano  Signora Forest."

Charmed, I'm sure," murmured Enilda, while
Mrs. Chromo harshly interrupted :

"Count," she said brusquely, "why didn't you
tell me Miss Forestii was in London ? "

She opened her fan with a whirl, and began to
fan herself violently. Flora stared open-mouthed.
What a strange tone of voice ! Had Lucy gone
crazy ?

For the best reason in the world," the Count
replied cheerily ; " I did not know it myself."

At that moment young Pastor came up to
Flora.

Mind," he said, " I am to take you in to supper ; "
then he added in a whisper, *' Have you told them

yet?"

Nonsense," said Flora, sharply. " Don't breathe
on my hair like that ; you're positively walking up
my dress. Of course I haven't told them ; perhaps
I've changed my mind."

He turned really pale.

What are you two quarrelling about ? " said
D'Alfredi.

I was telling him perhaps I'd changed my mind
about having supper," answered Flora promptly

Chromo caught the word supper.

What, are you hungry already ? Well, T suppose
it's not poetic to say so, but I am  I'm starved," she
cried.

"To think such words should ever be heard in
my house," said the Baron.

*just the place to hear them," proffered the
Count quickly. " One should bring an appetite
here, as one brings a fan or a button-hole flower'

Clareraont offered his arm to Enilda. The soprano
had just reached the ' lo sono docile.'

May I tell you something ? " said Claremont
earnestly. " I thought I had often seen you looking
well before, but to-night you are positively lovely."

She smiled. "I'm glad of that!" she answered.
It always makes me feel happy to know that I am
looking well." Her eye fell on her dress.

It's my favourite colour," he said, his own following
her glance. " Blue is true, you know."

"Ah, I suppose being a colour it knows no
better than to be true ; now, were it a man, for
instance."

"You are unjust," he said shortly; then he added

in a softer tone, " It's very hot ; suppose we try
and make our way tlii-ougb that crush to the
terrace."

No ! " she reigned. " I don't feel the heat, and 
I don't care to walk on the terrace." She was interrupted
by a cadenza of such miraculous elaboration
that every one involuntarily held their breaths.

She's singing admirably to-night ! " said Florestan,
coming up and holding out a careless hand. " I
thought I should get a chance to speak to you sooner
or later." He nodded coldly but politely to Claremont.
"You are looking, need I say it charmingly."

I did my best," she interrupted.

"Your worst would have been anybody else's
best," said Claremont, not to be outdone by Florestan
in civility. Then he added :

It is so hot that I've just been trying to induce
Miss Rozen to take a turn upon the terrace."

Then he stopped abruptly, whilst Florestan could
not prevent a look of intense anxiety coming into his
eyes. Claremont noticed it, and purposely said no
more ; he seemed to enjoy Florestan's suspense.
Enilda was the first to speak.

"Don't be jealous; he asked me to go, but  I
declined."

Florestan quickly caught her bantering tone.

It was quite right of you," he replied. " You

know you would have broken my heart had you
walked alone with any man on any terrace."

Claremont could not help a deep flush passing
over his face. He was about to make some remark
when a hand lightly tapped his shoulder; his wife
stood beside him.

I came up," she said, " to say we are to go to
the royal table to supper together. H. R. H. proposed
it. Patti is going to sing after, then we can
all get into a quiet corner. She's to sing four songs
the Ernani cavatina ; bohea from the ' Sicilian
Vespers ; ' the Romeo and Juliet waltz ; and Dinah
shadow sons. Isn't it wonderful her singins so
often ? "

The cloud had left Claremont's face. " As wonderful
as it is agreeable," he said. " One can never hear
too much of that golden voice. How did Forrest!
dare to sing ' Una voce ' when Patti was in the room ? "

Americans will dare to do and say anything ! "
said Enildci, and for an instant all talk was at a
standstill.

Then a dark-eyed, handsome young man made his
way through the crowd, and seated himself at the
piano.

Whom are we to hear now ? " said Lady Mildred.
At that moment Miss Chances-Cressy came up on
the arm of Professor Protoplasm.

Oh, is that you, auntie ? " said Lady Mildred.
You look as if you knew the young man ; do you ? "

"That I do," said Miss Chances-Cressy cordially.
His name is Eugene Hope, and he is one of the
sweetest singers in the world ; his father was a
Baltimore-Huguenot, an old friend of mine " 
then Miss Chances-Cressy sighed as if in memory
of a tender past. The young man began to sing,
whilst she lifted her glass, the famous French lorgnon
that used so to impress Flora in days gone by in
Chicago, and as of old the enamelled handle threw a
dark shadow on the rose of her delicate cheeks : she
stared idly not at the son of her old friend, but at
the famous Madame du Barry who hung in pink and
white perfection on the opposite wall. Professor
Protoplasm followed her glance.

When he has finished singing," he whispered ;
I will tell you my private opinion of the du Barry."
The song stopped suddenly. " I don't believe
D'Aiguillon was her confident ; I don't think she had
anything to do with the dismissal of the Parliament
in '71. I don't believe she wasted the treasures of
the State, and she must have been so fascinating
that Robespierre was a brute for arresting her."

Miss Chances-Cressy dropped her glass. "Professor,"
she said severely, " I am afraid you were won
over by her pretty face." Then she lifted her glass

and stared long and earnestly at the painted
courtesan.

No, indeed, not her beauty," he responded ; " but
she really had some good traits; you know she
protected men of letters and artists of the time."

Stop," said Miss Chances-Cressy again severely ;
she only did that because she feared their ridicule."

What are you discussing ? " said Enilda. Miss
Chances-Cressy's tone changed from severity to
graciousness.

Only discussing one of Louis Xv's favourites,
a person who lived many years ago, and whom you
never would have met in society, unless in Chicago,
or New York,"

Flora was standing near Baron D'Alfredi; she did
not point, but she looked at the old gentlewoman and
said slily to her host :

' Gaze at her and take her in  in penny numbers.
Isn't she wonderful ? I call her the little old woman
who lived in a shoe."

D'Alfredi shook his head. " You're a wicked srirl,"
he said, but he laughed and smiled with her just
the same.

Miss Chances-Cressy had altered but little in
appearance. She still wore her white hair piled
immoderately high on her small head ; her complexion
was still the same pasty mixture of bismuth

and Oriental cream ; her violet eyes, shaded by brows
like two bands of black velvet, were as luminous of
belladonna as of yore, and as heavily shaded underneath
with artificial black as they ever had been ; the
same unfading rose bloomed on her withered cheeks ;
the same cherry paste incarnadined her lips ; the
same ebony cane supported her limping footsteps ;
and the same jewelled chatelaine for fan, handkerchief,
and lorgnon depended from her shapely
waist. If anything she seemed younger in appearance.
There were a brightness in her eye, a cheeriness
in her smile, and an airiness in her gesture
which betokened that season when the earth bursts
into verdure, the tree into blossom, and the bird into
song. As she made her way through the rooms she
was followed by the remarks, looks, and opinions,
which follow in the wake of a shooting-star, or some
agreeable phenomena in nature. No one knew how
she got herself up, but every one respected that
effort to put the best foot forward, which the world
not alone exacts, but alone knows how to appreciate.
Assume a virtue if yow have it not, or assume a complexion
if you have it not. Miss Chances-Cressy
certainly did the latter, and by so doing was convinced
that she had fulfilled all obligations towards a
generous world but an incomplete nature.

She knew every artist who had ever sung. She

spoke of Grist as if she were still carolling * Qui la
voce ' on some back staircase. She remembered Pasta
and Pared i, and even told tales of Catalans, whose
song like whose motto was gold. She remembered
Persian's music-box and Sontag's silvery voice, and
stopped the Professor as they n eared the piano to
tell him that an Italian singer named Tedeschi
had such a mercenary father, that one night he
kept the house waiting three-quarters of an hour
before the opera began, to weigh his daughter's
salary to a fraction, exacted and paid the moment
before she began to dress; on this interesting
occasion the scales had broken down during the
operation, and the audience, she amongst the number,
had to wait whilst another pair of weights was
fetched.

They're adorable to listen to, these singers," she
said ; " but it is heart-breaking to think that their
one idea is money. They're grasping, one and all,
and every note that comes from their throats must
have its equivalent in filthy lucre. Why don't people
since as birds minor ? "

"Most of them do," said Flora, who came up at
this moment, "just about as wildly, with just about
as much sense, and always when you don't want 'em
to. The genuine canary is the average opera-singer
of the day. Shut him up, he howls ; put him in the

VOL. III. G

sun, he feeds ; sit down to table yourself, and he
begins yelling."

Flora's remarks were suddenly stopped. The Diva
began, and a sudden silence fell on the assembly.
One song after another followed. H. R. H. led the
applause, congratulated her enough to turn anybody's
head, and her music ended, the signal for
supper was given by H. E H, leading the way to a
brilliant room panelled in white and gold, hung with
superb portraits, and lit up with a perfection as rare
as original. Cunning globes of electric light, peeping
forth from branches of waxen tapers, shone as conspicuous
in their setting as the Regent amongst
crown jewels.

Lady Mildred, Claremont, Enilda, Flora, Florestan,
and their party found themselves at the daintiest
board, where wit flowed with wine, good-humour
was the bill of fare, and laughter rang as freely out
as the bursting of champagne corks.

There was a great deal of disgust felt amongst
other guests who had not been asked to sup with
royalty. The Americans were loudly condemned ;
their names sneered at; their fortunes discussed, and
their beauty questioned; their manners execrated,
and their general conduct be-rated; their clothes
alone "sot off" without the wholesale scathino-.
Enilda received the lion's share of condemnation.

The name, the Copper Queen, was echoed on all
sides. "What is it?" said one; "mines, tallow, petroleum,
or pinchbeck ? '' and after supper, when
she passed through the room on the Prince's arm,
remarks were made in her very face, not all complimentary,
but all more or less vulgar. It had been
bruited about that she possessed wit with wealth.
Her beauty none could gainsay; her fortune was
reputed colossal ; her toilette was the richest in the
room; her jewels the rarest;  in fact, it was a home
blow that night to many an illustrious 
whose family diamonds but not her pride had
diminished, to see perhaps one of the heirlooms of
her house glittering on the bosom of this younger
child of a younger branch, belonging to a younger
country and a younger race.

Count de Marcie and D'Orbach overheard some
of the grumbling. Lucy was on his arm, and once
she stopped suddenly and turned pale ; she declared
she heard the word " glue."

What ! " she cried, " even here. Why, I thought
all one needed to-day in London was money."

"It's about all one needs anywhere," replied the
Count; "and here, having everything else,  birth,
title, and position, one may permit oneself the
luxury of tolerating that which is all the world
anywhere else, yet when you come down to it will

G 2

never be anything but money in England. It's a
caprice like any other  ah ! "

The Count stopped abruptly. The Prima Donna,
Mademoiselle Forestii, was coming towards him, accompanied
by her lady companion. Lucy looked
sufficiently annoyed, but the noble D'Orbach was
quite equal to the occasion. He stretched forth his
hand with a very grand air, and his face was
wreathed in smiles as he thanked the artist for her
sino'ina-, told Fraulein Marx that she " was lookiucr
extremely well," remarked "that it was a magnificent
evening, he was surprised to see them in
London, and  could he be of any service ? "

Yes," said Mademoiselle Forestii, half-curtly,
Fraulein Marx is feeling rather faint, and  and 
I hardly know how to say, but  will you take her
to have some refreshment ? "

Lucy started, and D'Orbach murmured a few
unintelligible words. The last were plainer :

Quite at Mademoiselle's service." Then without
more ado he offered his arm and walked away with
the Fraulein.

CHAPTER V.

Fraulein Marx had black eyes, fair hair, a clear-cut
profile, and a mouth that betrayed an indomitable
will. A smile, the very autumn of perfidy,
traversed her face as she walked along through the
now half-deserted rooms. All the world was at
supper, and yet there where still crowds everywhere.
A delicious band sent tender strains out upon the
air. The French windows were open, and an odour
of heliotrope and mignonette stole through, mingling
their fragrance with the heat of the drawing-room,
that smell of bouquets of every conceivable flower,
of perfumed robes and old laces, toilette-powder
puffs, and Oriental cosmetics; in short, the indescribable,
commingled cosmopolitan perfume of a
crowded drawing-room, in a great city, on a hot
night.

'let us go to the terrace," said the Fraulein
softly; "I do not care for refreshment other thana

breath of fresh air. I think it will be less crowded
there than here ;  but, Count, you are looking pale,
the change will do you good."

"You are a fiend incarnate," he muttered under
his breath ; " at least speak German."

She raised her heavy black brows.

Shall it be the terrace ? "

No," he answered ; " I wish to talk with you.
There is a tiny library here that I know well ; we
will go to it ; but we must first seem to take some
supper."

They re-threaded their way through the rooms
via the dining-room, and finally crossing a wide antechamber,
reached a little apartment, dim, silent, cool,
and shadowy ; it was unoccupied, and the Count
had chosen wisely in thinking that they could there
converse undisturbed. The room was like the rest of
the house, a gem in its way ; only to-night it seemed
strangely deserted, and the very sort of place in
which to talk secretly. A shaded lamp cast flickering
shadows on the wall; the heavy curtains w-ere
hermetically sealed ; a bronze clock on the chimney-piece
had run down ; and the walls were tapestried
so thick that no sound of the outer world could by
any chance penetrate. Graceful curtains fell before
the opened door in such idleness, that it might as
well have been shut for all one could tell outside

what was going on within. The Count motioned
his companion to a seat. She looked at it, at him,
and then deliberately sat down in another. She
opened her fan, and began fanning herself in silence.
Was she waiting for him to speak ? Evidently.
She had not long to wait. His words were brief,
but to the point.

You are a clever woman," he said ; "how did you
jet to New York, how find me ? I  I thought  I
had hoped that you were  dead."

She still fanned herself, but responded with the
utmost graciousness.

Naturally ; but shall I tell you ? Yes ? You see
I am not dead, and  and it was not difficult to find
you ; the difficult thing was to get away from 
Toulon."

Hush ! " he said, glancing warily around ; " hush !
walls have ears ; not that name here."

You are sensitive," she sneered. " Toulon nowadays
means cholera, or  anything rather than  "

'' Go on."

"After you left me on that night, to do as best
I could, I only fell from the frying-pan into the fire.
I was arrested, tried, and transported ; but by making
love to one of the keepers, I managed to make my
escape. I got to a river and a boat, and  a boatman
took me in."

'< Wi I  that is how I heard you were drowned."

Most Hkely ; but the boat was none other than
the one prepared for you, and the boatman none
other than Ricard who loved me, but whom you
were fool enough to hire to put me out of the way."

The Count turned ghastly with rage.

"Don't tell me that," he said; 'ris there then no
more honour amongst thieves ? "

No ; this is an age of progress ; there used to be,
but dishonour pays better."

Spare me your wit ; but he shall pay me well for
this."

You owe him a deal," she said calmly. " It was
through him I heard of your escape, your arrival in
New York, your combination with  "

I defy you to speak that name here."

Oh, as you will ; but  you don't ask me what
I want."

I received your letters in New York ; they were
plain enough ? "

I think my speech can be plainer. I thought I
was your wife, a countess,  ha ! ha ! "

Then she laughed so long and so loudly that the
very light seemed to flicker anew on the ceiling.

Are you mad ? Tell me what you want ; I can't
stop here for ever. Is it money ? "

"No."

Is it position ? "

No."

Is it  " Then a sinister look crept into this
eyes.

Yes," she said ; " it is revenge."

He began rapidly pacing the floor, up and down,
up and down, until the room seemed rocking.

"You might have trusted me," she continued. " I
was your creature body and soul ; did you imagine
for one moment that such crimes as yours, such a
life as yours, could ever remain long hidden ? They
say  "

'' Never mind what they say. I want to know
all you have to say, and to end this conversation."


"' You are impatient. Why did you run away
from New York ? Why did you leave your interests,
and  and that idiot of a Forestii ;  but now rest in
peace. She knows all ! "

All !  good God, are you mad ? What do you
mean ? "

He abruptly ceased his walking up and down.
All what ? Has she dared? "

Oh, nothing ! She came across one of your
letters to me, and thinking you were in love with
some other woman, fell into hysterics, and confessed
everything. She couldn't have come to a better

person, your own lawful wife ; I  I assure you I
consoled her."

How did you come to be with her at all ? "

I followed you to Ems ; but being interested ina
good-looking young banker, hadn't time then to
interfere with your love-making; only when you
went to New York, Picard, who still adores me,
told me I had better be on hand in  well, in case of
need. I didn't know you had gone so far with the
singer. Bigamy was the one crime of which you
were not guilty. And now  "

And now ? "

'' Well now, what do you propose to do about it ?
Well, I'll not be hard upon you; I said I wanted my
revenge, but I want more than that."

You want money ? "

Yes ; I want money, but no paltry sum."

Well ! "

I want you to give me two hundred thousand
dollars."

He interrupted her with an oath. "Are you
crazy ? Two hundred thousand dollars ! Where am
I to get the money ? And if I could get it, why
should I pay you such a sum ? "

You will pay me that to get rid of me for ever !
I promise to give you every jmper I possess that
could criminate you. I promise to give you our

marriage certificate, and to deny ever having known
you, and I promise to take myself out of your sight
for evermore."

And the consequences if I refuse ? "

Ah, if you refuse !  but you won't refuse."

I tell you I must refuse for the best of reasons ;
it is absolutely impossible for me to get together
such a sum of money."

You have rich friends ; you can borrow it. Mr.
Rozen, for instance."

He lifted a warning finger. " Hush ! " he said ; '' I
thought I heard some one coming this way."

She stopped, and held her open fan uplifted in the
air. For a moment both listened attentively. Footsteps
were heard coming towards the door, then
passing it, and were finally lost in the corridor
beyond.

Fraulein Marx was the first to speak.

Whether you can get it or not, you'll have to, for
I'll not take a cent less, and I must have it soon."

He made no reply, and for an instant seemed to
be reflecting deeply.

'you are thinking it over," she hazarded, and
again began fanning herself. " I will give you time
to consider."

Devil !  if I could believe you. No, no, Adele, it
won't do ; I've no assurance that you would not play

me false. What proof can I have besides those
papers ? "

She hesitated a moment. "You forget that my
position in one sense is not all that heart might
desire  that I am, like yourself, an escaped convict."

D  m it ! " he said, " will you stop using those
names here ? "

Well, perhaps you're right ; we ought to understand
e:\ch other almost without speaking. I will
tell you the truth ; I want to go away with somebody ;
I want to marry, and lead a respectable life."

Ah, how touching ! "

Yes, isn't it ? Besides, America is crettinor too
hot to hold me, and  I don't wish to be personal, but
I think you yourself had better be looking out."

Did he turn a shade paler, or did she imagine
it?

Nonsense ! " he said. " You are the only person
who stands in my way, and  "

"And I suppose you'd like to put me out of it.
That game won't do, Fritz ; and let me tell you here
that if anything happens to me your head won't
be safe an hour. I hope you won't think that
anybody could make me forego my revenge, nor anything
less than the sum I have named. Ah ! "  she
got up quickly  "we must be going back to the
drawing-room; it is so long since I have had the

pleasure of a conversation with you, that I had really
forgotten the lapse of time."

Don't say that again. I'm in no temper to stand
your sarcasm ; don't drive me too far. I tell you I cannot
give you two hundred thousand dollars  Ah !
permit me"  here several persons sauntered idly
into the room. She accepted his offered arm. " I
think I once saw the miniature here, the most
perfect likeness of Madame de Lamballe, they say,
that exists."

The Count and Fraulein Marx made the usual
salutations as they passed from the room.

They could not have overheard us ? " she
whispered.

"No." Then he added in a louder voice, as if
proceeding with an ordinary conversation : " And if I
get it, it could not possibly be before my arrival in
New York." They were getting into the crowd
again. " And when do you return ?  shortly ? "

Shortly."

I thought it was most imperative. Shall you be
leaving this week ? "

"Scarcely; that is to say, I have not decided;
but  " A strong pressure on his arm finished his
sentence in a more decided manner. "I think it
just possible I may go on Saturday," he added.

Pray," she said with an eager voice, " do not go

without letting us hear from you beforehand ; you
know Mille. Forestii regards you as her most valued
friend."

At that moment Mille. Forestii was seen coming
towards them. She bestowed an angry glance on
the Count.

"Where have you been so long?" she said
querulously. " I'm tired to-death, and my carriage
has been waiting more than an hour 1 "

Must you go ? " said the Count. " At least let
me see you out."

Thanks," said Fraulein Marx, cordially, " we
could not think of taking you away so early."

Ah ! you insist on coming," said Forestii. " It is
indeed good of you."

Then the Count offered his arm, and the three left
the room together.

The Baron, Lady Mildred, Enilda, and several
others were taking ices on the terrace. Flora's voice,
as usual, was heard high above the rest.

It's the dodges thing I ever heard of Baron,
tell Enilda about your house."

Oh, there's nothing to tell."

Except that it's all a delusion and a snare," put
in Flora.

"Quite right; all a delusion and a snare," he
repeated. " You know, as Hamlet says, ' Look at

this picture, and then on that.' Here, for instance,
we have a marble pavement, lovely ladies in lovely
dresses, roses, trees, palms, and flowers; but turnover
this marble, and what do you see on the other
side ? Palms, roses, and lovely forms ? Nothing of
the kind. Sweltering cooks in white caps, joints of
beef, legs of mutton, featherless birds, bunches of
asparagus; and instead of this lovely panorama
under a sky filled with midnight stars, a long low
kitchen bustling with ranges, and the walls decorated
with endless pots and pans."

"Yes; I know," said Flora; "like that old
diplomatist who has just left, who' had" a whole
latter che cuisine on his breast in the shape of
decorations."

Exactly," laughed the Baron.

A polite way," said Enilda, " of suggesting that
the heart of your house resembles the venerable
diplomatist's breast."

"And shows conclusively that, like your terrace,
there are two sides to every question," added
Florestan.

"But, happily, like the terrace, you only see
upon one side at a time."

Though, like the Baron," said Lady Mildred,
we know how to appreciate both."

The sounds of a waltz came floating through a

window. A celebrated pianist was playing ; not one
of Chopin's immortal inspirations, but a rollicking-tune.


Dear me," said Flora ; " I'm dying for an
American three-step ! Baron, may we dance ? Whoever
that is playing, he has a perfect Vienna beer
accent. You know, Enilda, just the way they play
in the garden next the Thalia Theatre in New York.
But, Baron, may we ? "

You may do anything you like in my house."

Flora was too late. The Prince had already set the
example, and was whirling round with Enilda's
predecessor, the last but one imported Transatlantic
professional beauty. Soon the floor was filled with
flying couples.

Dancing on the carpet ? " cried the Baron.
"Never!"

Oh, that doesn't matter a bit," said Enilda, as his
arm encircled her slender waist. " Dancing, like
gambling, is a passion ; who loves dancing will dance
anywhere."

By this time the band had taken their cue from
the pianist. Dancing was the order of the night,
and the concert bid fair to develop into a full-blown
ball. Never before had votaries to Terpsichore
kept time to a more inspiring measure ; never
had fairer forms languished on happier shoulders,

or brighter eyes shone into deeper and more
passionate ones, than on the spur of this improvised
round. Fans, flowers, gloves, charms, rings, and
handkerchiefs, made the proudest favours ever bestowed
at any cotillon. The rooms were one whirl
of laughing women and enthusiastic men, and the
grave musicale suddenly became a very Babel of
voices, each voice seemingly louder, clearer, gayer
than its predecessor. The evening finally ended like
the breaking-up of a children's party. There were
more flights to the terrace, and renewed flights to
the supper-room ; the sound of rattling Sevres,
tinkling crystal, and trickling magnums. There was
such hubbub and unceasing echo of merriment,
that the contagion spread up and down, even
seemed to break through the flooring of the terrace,
and descend to the kitchen on the heads of cook-aids
and cooks' devils. The whole house was invaded ;
footmen were choking with laughter in their white
velvet collars ; the pages looked like imps of fun ina
pantomime ; and the staid butler, who had wished
his master the same unvarying good-night and good-morning
for three decades, wore so dazzling a smile,
that when he approached a lamp he seemed to
totally extinguish its light.

The Baron was ubiquitous  here, there, everywhere;
whilst the various members of his family

VOL. III. . H

seemed social reproductions of himself. The same
ease, thoughtfulness, good-humour, and unflagging
hospitality were directed towards their brother's
guests as if they had been their own ; instead of
one host there seemed half-a-dozen, all attending
to every one's wants at the same time, spurring
on the dancers, whipping up the musicians ; not
alone interesting themselves in withered wallflowers,
but even flirting if necessary with maiden ladies
of uncertain years and heretofore most uncertain
temper. At last the evening came to an end. The
Prince had waltzed his last waltz, and a galop that
would have resuscitated a dying Taglioni, so there
was nothing for it but to say good-night to the hosts,
good-night to friends, and good-bye to one of the
happiest days in the year ; the maddest, merriest day,
and one which Flora vowed she would never forget

o

whilst she lived.

The Baron was looking a little paler, a little more
tired, and seemed a little more nervous than when
his party had begun ; but think you any part of his
house bore the stamp of an evening's wear and tear ?
Not a bit of it. The lights dreamed as brio-ht aso

o o

ever; the flowers bloomed as fair in their magic
vases ; the rooms were filled with the same mysterious
perfume  that subtle odour of finality ; yet
there were no morsels of lace petticoats decorating

the carved feet of chairs ; no floating ribbons, and
no stray flying curls here, there, or in odd corners ;
there were no crushed exotics on the carpets, and
no stemless gardenias trodden into the dining-room's
marqueterie. Enilda thought to herself as she bade
their friend good-night :

Has there been a musicale ?  has there been a
party, a supper, a dance ?  or have we dreamed it ?
Have we heard Patti's siren voice, and the waltz's
siren strains ?  or have we been asleep in fairyland,
and lived through an Arabian night's entertainment
? " Then when the chill morning air blew
on her forehead she repeated vaguely to herself:

''Yes; that is it. We have been dreaming under
the stars, the dawn has overtaken us, and daybreak
has come ; our fairy companions have fled
with the night; and this  this is the awakening;
this is morning: in London."

CHAPTER VI.

Several days after the Baron's party Enilda
wrote her father the following : 

"Dearest Papa,

First, a scolding, because you never hardly
ever write to me ; second, a good, long, loving letter
to tell you that you are wrong not to let me hear
from you oftener, and to repeat that I miss you more
and more, and mo-are, as Charles Thorn used to say to
Clara Morris in ' Camille.' London is such a big place,
such a world ; there is everybody and everything in
it but my own dear papa, whose face is constantly
before mine, whose voice I constantly hear, and
whose kind care I constantly miss. I wish you'd
send for me to come home,  won't you ? I dream
of you often  so often; and in my dreams you look
tired and worried. I am not superstitious, but I
wish you'd appear happier when you pay me those

little impromptu nocturnal visits  I wish you would.
I have told Charlotte Corday all about them  my
dreams, you know  and she rolls her eyes higher
than ever and says  can't you just hear her ?

' Honey chile, who knows ?  'specs Massa Rozen's
got things to worry him like, an' if he don't ses skip
and chip about in dem car visions, don't you go
for to fretting' ; lev a good time while you can, and
don't sorry trouble at a dollar a hundred ; real ornaments
come sass 'muff 'thou scooping' 'em up from
dreams,' etc. etc.

There, isn't that Charlotte all over ? Bless her !
But I must tell you she is changed, is grown sad
and silent ; I've given her a new Methodist prayer-book,
which scarcely ever leaves her hands. A funny
thing happened yesterday. Count de Marcie  for
whom, by the way, I cannot overcome my aversion
called, and as there were none of the servants
about, she went to the door. The bell had rung
so often that in desperation I had started to go myself,
so we met in the hall. Charlotte opened the
door, and when she saw the Count her face went quite
green under her skin ; she put her hand to her heart,
and nearly had one of those fainting-fits that she
had one day in New York. You must remember it.
Oh no, you wouldn't; for she expressly begged me
to say nothing to you about it then, but yesterday

I was really alarmed. However, she wouldn't see a
doctor, and I suppose it was just as well, for this
morning she seems all right again, good soul ! You
know, papa, I think she is sicker than we realize,
for we shall lose her some day  the dear black link
that binds us to the long ago. I must stop this tone
or I shall be dropping tears on the paper, and you
wouldn't like that, would you ?

"Now, 'just fancy,' as they say here, you're deliberately
asking me to tell you everything I do in
London, every one I see, everywhere I go, every
friend I make, every book I read, every  why every
dress I wear ; and yet they say men are not curious.
It comes to this, you love me;  you have no one
but me ; you miss me, and you want to see me absolutely
every minute of the twenty-four hours, just as
if I were a little girl once more ; just as if I were in
well, in New Ulm ; just as if it were five o'clock,
and you were coming home, and going to tell me a
fairy story, kiss me, give me some candies, and
perhaps a new silver dollar, which you would quietly
hunt for, find, and lose again, and then pretend that
it dropped from the ceiling whilst my head was
turned ! Oh ! I know you, old pater, and I can see
through all your dodges just  well, just as easily as
I can see myself when I look at myself in the glass.
By the way, I do that very often. ' I'm in beauty,'

as they say in London, and, isn't it funny ?  they call
me ' The Copper Queen ' almost to my very face ;
they make remarks on my appearance just as if I
were a statue ; speak of our money and my manners
quite as if I were the third person singular, and not
myself at all. But I like it ; I adore it. I'm getting
so vain you wouldn't know me. Ah ! before we go
any further, am I spending too much money ? You
don't complain. The bills seem something enormous.
I thought New York the dearest city in the world,
but London is ahead on the spending question. In
America, after all, one spends only dollars ; but here
it is guineas, right and left; and really a pound
isn't a pound, but  five dollars.

Ah ! enough of money  talking shop. You
want to know where I have been ; well, I will tell
you  oh no ! I can't now, for some one has just
come, and Flora is shrieking up the balusters for me
to go down to the drawing-room. I must dress for
dinner afterwards; then after that for the Queen's
Ball in Buckingham Palace. July 4th, just think of
it. I suppose you are in the Quaker City celebrating
the great event of 1776. How odd it is  we had
utterly forgotten our centenary, and in speaking of it
at luncheon to-day an old friend said, ' 187(3  aw,
yes  but  but what  aw  has to-day to do with a
hundred years ago ? ' ' Nothing,' said Flora she's

such a quick creature  ' nothing.' Then we all
laughed.

"Good-bye. Don't work too hard, and don't fail
to write oftener.

Always the same, your own,

Enilda."

At ten o'clock Enilda, Flora, and Mrs. Chromo
were on their way to Buckingham Palace. They
kept up a lively chatter, in which the dress the
Princess might wear, and the tea thrown in Boston
Harbour so many years back, where discussed in terms
of equal enthusiasm. But time has brought about
many changes, and one that of a native-born
American, spending the evening of the 4th of July,
the glorious anniversary day of their independence,
where ? At the great Centenary Ball in Philadelphia
? Nothing of the sort. At an English
Queen's Ball in an English Palace ; if a hundred
years has brought about such a thing, what shall
we not see in another hundred ? A Queen in
America, or England a Republic ?

Enilda and her friends were asked to dine before
the ball to meet the New American Minister, but
refused the distinguished honour. They did well :
this individual, one of the greatest snobs America
has ever produced, was well calculated to give the

British a nice idea of what some American ropes
are.

But the Ball ! Their carriage was so long in the
line they thought they never should get in. Before
they arrived it began to rain, as it almost always
does when one is going to a ball in London, and they
were in a fearful fright lest they should get their
gowns bespattered ; fears, however, were groundless,
for they alighted under a covered portico, whence,
without fuss or bother, they were ushered in to the
ground-floor of the palace.

Somehow there was no excitement such as there
is at the White House balls in America ; no laughing
and talking and chattering amongst a crush of
people come prepared to have a good time. The
attendant who removed their wraps was unsmiling ;
and when they reached the foot of the grand staircase
Enilda really had a- fright. The Yeomen of the
Guard, dressed in their quaint Elizabethan costume,
standing around, looked as if they had stepped out
of some old picture-frame, and reminded her of
Madame Tussaud's; she didn't realize they were
Imman beings till one moved. It struck her as
incongruous, men and women wearing modern clothes,
and the attendants appearing in the costume of three
hundred years ago.

Americans ought to have very tender memories

on coming into any English palace ; being strangers,
and only having guide-books to go by, they scarcely
ever think of a present, and only think of it as
it recalls a past. Although Buckingham Palace has
few historical associations, Enilda had half imagined
she should run across King George the Third in
one corner, Queen Charlotte in another, or Queen
Adelaide in another ; yet she found to-day very near,
and once having paid a private visit to the palace,
instead of a George's Court, saw only the young
Queen and her Consort, heard the careless laughter
of happy children, and youthful voices echoing and
re-echoing through now silent corridors. In one
room  one should scarcely speak of it now, except
it came so persistently into her mind ?  she remembered
in this great chamber curtains were drawn,
and the light was scarcely ever permitted to enter :
that every object was covered with dust, and a long
table drawn up near the fireside was left with every
article untouched, just as it was when the Prince
Consort died ! There were the writing-desk and
open ink-bottle, the half-used quill, and an arm-chair
turned aside from the table, as if its occupier had
been looking at a little portrait just to his right : the
picture of a fair young woman with bright eyes, rosy
lips, attired in a low dress of apple-green trimmed
with white lace, the picture, not of a Queen, but of

his loving wife Victoria " ; and, strange it was, that
passing through all the other rooms, and even when
she came to the beautiful ball-room, this silent deserted
chamber kept constantly coming into her mind.

The Court came in punctually at a quarter before
eleven :  The Prince and Princess of Wales ; Princess
Louise with Lord Lome ; the Princess Mary Adelaide,
Duchess of Teck, such a sweet-looking woman; the
Duke of Teck, Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar ; and
Heaven knows how many others besides. Enilda
stood in the diplomatic circle, much to Flora's and
Lucy's disgust, as they had not, like her, been specially
asked and taken there by some Diplomat. The
number of the attendants on the Royalties seemed to
her very fabulous. The Prince and Princess of Wales,
followed by the Court, went to a raised dais and
stood up before a row of gilt chairs ; whilst the ladies
of the Court raised themselves around against the
wall in a semicircle of courtly effigies. The dancing
began immediately after, and such a quadrille was
danced ! The band were all dressed in red, up
in a gallery at one end of the room, facing the Court,
and Flora declared they reminded her of the organ-loft
in the Union Park Congregational Church in
Chicago, and the Oratorio Society getting ready to
shout " Hallelujah ! " The arrangement of the guests
also seemed curious.

The general idea prevails in America that if one
goes to a Queen's Ball, one hob-nobs with everybody,
even the Royalties; and that every one present is
just as good as every one else. On the contrary,
the stars of the evening  meaning their Highnesses
are, so to speak, on the platform; to the left
is the diplomatic circle ; to the right the Bi->- Wio-s,
Duchesses, etc. ; and a line morally drawn from the
entrance-door where the Royalties come in, separates
these privileged few from every other human being
at the ball. Of course the other people really are
all herded together ; they have no more to do with
Royalty than one has with the planet Jupiter ; they
pack, crane their necks, and stare right and left in
vain, for not a hundredth part of the guests get
even a glimpse of the Prince and Princess. When
they dance it is amongst themselves, and they never
go into the Royal circle unless brought there by the
Prince or by some Foreign Ambassador ; in reality,
with the exception of seeing their names printed
beside Royalty in the 'Morning Post' on the ensuing
day, they might as well have been at a ball at a great
brewer's, or any of the other fashionable London
entertainers. They indeed have funny ideas of
things in America. Now, even Enilda supposed that
Princes and Princesses would be floating about the
floor here, there, and everywhere, like the President

and cabinet in Washington, making themselves
generally agreeable, but  she was mistaken.

The ball-room had never been more brilliant : it
was exquisitely lighted, and presented a scene of
bewildering beauty. The dresses and jewels were
such, Lucy Chromo said her eyes were blinded only
to look upon them. Such orders, decorations, and
stars, from St. John to Catherine of Russia, from
Persia to Portugal, from the " Garter " to the
Golden Fleece," and the Annunziata to the Black
Eagle of Prussia, and heraldry alone knows what
more besides ! The prettiest sight was when the
daucino- beo[an. There was nothing but valses and
quadrilles ; not as in America,  no polka, no ,
no schottische, no mazurka, and no Prairie-queen.
The Royalties danced every set ; it seemed
to Enilda that the Princess never sat down once ;
whilst she was so tired standing, she thought she
should faint before midnight. She could scarcely
realize that she was looking upon so many distinguished
people, and unconsciously her thoughts
flew to the old days, when m America she used to
read about lords and ladies, and wondered what they
looked like. She had a vague idea that there would
be something about them which would distinguish
them from other people; but she had found them
exactly like other gentlefolk in England, neither

more nor less well-bred, neither handsomer nor
homelier; yet, had she told the truth, would have
said " they have a little something in their manner
which is like the varnish on a picture ; it gives ita
glaze and helps to preserve, but does not radically
change it."

There were numbers of lovely women in the room,
the Princess the loveliest of all. Enilda had never
before realized what a beauty she was ; for in fairness
she stands out amongst other women as conspicuous
as a white lily in a bunch of buttercups.

She had a fine face, with soft expression and
marked aristocratic mien; dark, blue-grey eyes,
with arched brows ; a low forehead, slightly Grecian
nose, small mouth, and a pale complexion, reflecting
innumerable lights and shadows. Her figure
was not only slight and graceful, but so extremely
youthful that it was hard to believe her the
mother of big boys and girls; her carriage was so
distinctly her own that even with her back towards
one, amongst five hundred, one could single her out.
She dressed exquisitely. No other woman in England
could touch her for the way she puts on her clothes.
She wore a black dress with bands of silver looped
up with garlands and bouquets of black currants,
black corsage trimmed with Spanish fringe, an
incomparable tiara of diamonds, and her breast

covered with orders like a statesman. One never
tired of looking at her; from the tips of her
fingers to the last fold of her tulle robe, her
person was interesting. She was very gracious, yet
Enilda thought her face sometimes impassive. She
knew she was a woman and mother, yet could much
easier fancy her a vestal kneeling at some shrine,
than rocking babies in her arms, or perhaps playing
cat's-cradle to amuse them.

The Princess Louise was the prettiest of the
Queen's daughters ; fair, with regular features, with
blue eyes, and a most winning smile ; and Lord Lome
standing beside her looked as happy and contented
as a great school-boy.

After the first few dances danced in the royal circle

Enilda slipped out with kind Lord Alfred P , who

showed her around and interested her tremendously.
Of course he was full of India and the trip, and the
Prince's first tiger, which she was disloyal enough to
declare she believed had in his homage courted his
death. Lord Alfred laughed pleasantly and said,
Little lady, you may rally a Prince, but beware
how you libel a tiger." She ran up against Flora
and Mrs. Chromo, both looking charmingly; both
"their eyes in fine frenzy rolling" because they
could not get near the Royal circle.

It's a delusion and a snare ! " said Flora. " I

wouldn't know what the Royalties were like if T
hadn't seen their photos in every shop-window in
Regent Street."

Flora was hanging on the arm of the Equerry
of the Duke of Albany, the Earl of H.'s younger
brother. A charming man, such a good fellow, and
the best imitator of popular artists in the world ;
Enilda couldn't look at him without hearing History's
fearful throat-rattle as Lady Macbeth, or Frou-Frou's
plaintive death-wail, " 2cne jetit  ef-fleur." She was
dying to hear him then and there, but supposed it
wouldn't have been quite the correct thing at a
State Ball. However, she whispered what had been
in her mind to the young Equerry, who rolled his
eyes in holy horror at the very thought. Young
Pastor was walking behind Flora, following at her
heels like a greyhound. Poor young fellow, he was
so much in love ! Flora was looking, by the way,
wonderfully pretty; and Enilda came very near
being jealous of her.

Lucy Chron had the arm of the Russian
Ambassador. He was a distinguished-looking man ;
tall, broad-chested, straight as a poplar; with very
wide-awake eyes, a real Slav look, and a moustache
as white as the snow on Mont Blanc. His Excellency
was too amusing; he spoke English just as well
as most English people ; but pretended not to be able

to, and the things English-women had taught him
to say ! Well !  well, a volume would not suffice to
put all down. One of his favourite expressions was,
Shut up I" When he first came to London he used
to go and sit by the Prince when he was ill with
fever ; and his delight was to tell every one to " shut
up," from H. R. H. downwards. Taking pattern of
English ladies, Enilda had also taught him a few
words which he was to use on the first convenient
occasion ; so he stopped her to repeat them, to see if
they were all right.

Lucy Chromo had been and was still talking
about the Grand Duke's di-symonds, and the wretched
American, Fanny Lear. All admitted that she was
wonderfully handsome, but wished  wished she were
not a compatriot. As for him, Lucy declared he was
secretly married to her, but Enilda would not believe
a word of it.

Then they ran up against Florestan with Lady
Mildred, who looked very bored. Enilda instantly
wondered where Claremont was ! She didn't see him,
and thought he was probably talking to some

]duchess in the corner. The Duchess of M

perhaps; she knew he admired her greatly. Her
Grace had been the theme of European Courts for
two decades, and no wonder, for she was still one of
the most beautiful women in the world, with a face

VOL. III. I

and figure that Francis I. might have had reproduced,
like that of Diane de Poictiers, for one of the
*' Three Graces." Her son, Lord M  , had just married
a lovely American, with eyes like stars, and hair
like Lady Godiva's ; and, speaking of that marriage,
another Duke's son, uho all said was destined to a
great future, had also married an American, equally
charming, but totally different in appearance ; a
strange, Juno-like creature, whose deep gray eyes
had inky lights in them like quicksilver; she had
blue-black hair, and a beautiful face  the very
essence of pride and warm blood. Euilda thought
at times she looked rather sad, and began, as usual,
to wonder, then said to herself,  " No, never mind ;
at a Court Ball I won't wonder."

She walked through room after room , but they
were all empty, and she was surprised, as out of
the thousands composing the upper ten, there did not
seem to be more than one thousand present, and
that one huddled into the ball-room. The other
apartments were beautiful, but had an uninhabited
look ; a got-up-for-the-occasion sort of air, like the
houses smart people hire in London to give balls in.
All the chimney-places were filled with banks of
exquisite flowers  flowers were here and there on
mantelpieces, but they seemed so little alive, that
when a lady passed through the room with a bouquet

ill her Land, they gave one the idea of being artificial.
Indeed, the decorations, floral and otherwise, seemed
to vie with the guests in the solemn state and
dignity of their deportment.

At half past one the Royalties went out to supper,
followed by the diplomatic body, and it was a sight
to see the people staring, drawn up in lines on either
side, with the same insatiable curiosity as if they had
never gazed on Royalty before. As to Enilda, when
it got to the supper hour, she was so tired she felt
ready to drop. Many other ladies looked worn-out, but
the Princess was as fresh as if she had just stepped
into the ball. Enilda forgot her fatigue, however, when
she caught sight of the glittering tables, and such a
service of gold plate as her eyes had. never before
rested upon ; and small wonder either, as it has been
gradually accumulating for centuries. She declared
the wall looked like a hish trellis, studded with gold
vines, branches of gold, flowers of gold, leaves of gold,
and panels literally encrusted with gold; whilst Flora
insisted that she would never be happy till she had
eaten an American ice-cream off each separate dish.

The Princess was very gracious, and spoke with
them several times. Enilda remarked that one stood
very still whilst she was speaking ; called her, as well
as the other Royal Princesses, " Ma'am " (Madame) ;
and when one came up or went away, dropped a kind

I 2

uf a cheese-curtsey, called a charity bob, a sort of flap
down and spring up like a jack-in-a-box ; which
Enilda had previously thought very odd, but had
been told was necessary.

Finally she danced with the Prince ! He was very
agreeable, frank, and handsome, and wore a most
winning smile, which lit up his face wonder: fully.
Enilda thought this smile explained his extraordinary
success with women ; it was really not too much
to say, that he was as handsome for a man as his
wife was for a woman, and his tact, bonhommie,
and consideration for all had justly made him one of
the most popular men in Europe. She must also do
him the justice to admit it wasn't a bit because he
was a Prince, but simply because he was a nice
cheery man, as faithful to old caprices as to new,
with a chivalrous fidelity which compelled a respect
for whomsoever he had honoured or still honours
with his special attentions.

Of course Enilda met everybody, and tried her
best to recollect what people talked about. After
supper the Ball was a little less ceremonious, and

she noticed that Miss , an old friend, was

brought into the circle by H. R. H., and danced twice
with him. It is all nonsense about Americans
taking up all the Prince's time. If they amuse him,
which is more than most people do, it becomes a

question of give and take. The world in general is
tired of hearing that the only reason Americans go to
any place is because they have money ; after seeing
all these Peers and Peeresses, and their hereditary
rank and precedence, which no amount of wealth
could purchase, Enilda came to the conclusion that
here there is this distinction and difference  money
is a king in every other country, but in England
must play second fiddle to birth. And what people
talked about? There was such a jumble she had
but a confused idea of the whole, only noticed that
not one person remembered it was the centenary
of America's independence ; fifty people, however,
spoke of a war being declared between Servia and
Turkey, and as Count S. looked very wise, she supposed
it meant that Russia would henceforth be on
the look-out.

Florestan came up, and as he could not make
love to Enilda, thought he would talk politics ; however,
after a few random speeches, he only remarked,
All Dizzy's sympathies are with Turkey."

Enilda then looked well at the Egyptian Sphinx,
whom she saw perfectly well to-night for the first
time. She looked many times at his cold, impassive
face, and asked herself in vain, " Is this the impersonation
as well as the author of ' Contain
Fleming ' ?  this astute, calculating statesman the

expanded blossom of that impetuous, impassioned
youth ? "

The Premier was speaking very earnestly with a
remarkable person, and  on every subject but the
one lying nearest the heart. She thought she had
never before seen a man such a very quintessence of
insolent grace and ease. He half dropped his eyes
whilst he was speaking ; his voice was slow and
cadenced, he even seemed to smile as he spoke in
iambics. She could scan his response to the Russian
Ambassador, just then in conversation with him,
beginning, "Ah, Count, you know  the hour is such,
etc., etc."

A brilliant and rising young poet passed and said
to him, " Good evening, sir ; I hope you're quite well."

The Sphinx slipped his hand into his breast,
reflected for an instant, and then replied, " I think,
sir, we are none of us ever quite well."

One of the chief topics of discussion seemed to
be my Lord Londonderry's son, who nearly broke his
head in the polo match the day before  naturally one
of the most interesting of the season, and the squabble
about the Marquis de Staple's child, whether it
should be brought up a Catholic or no ; the Exhibition
at Brussels; and a necklace which Prince
Dhulup Sling had thrown at a Prima Donna in a
bouquet which had broken her head open ; the blood

only ceased flowing, and the smile only returned to
her lips, when she learned that the hard object
which had so injured her was a diamond riviere of
the purest water.

For the first time in her life Enilda saw the Scotch
Feel danced by the Court, to the music of the
Queen's and Prince of Wales's pipers  a most maddening
affair; it made her think of heather and
snowstorms, plaids and philabegs, and a subtle odour
of whiskey-punch perfuming the night.

Lord Dudley Alas present, as amiable as ever, with
his young and beautiful wife on his arm. She
certainly took the palm as being the fairest of London
beauties present. The band was most delicious.
Enilda had never heard of Liddell before ; and never
heard D' Albert's " Sweetheart's Valse " better played.

A sudden passage in the flutes caused Lord D

to exclaim to Baron F. de Rothschild, " Dear me,
how like Persian !  she sang with the perfection of a
music-box, you know."

The diplomatic circle was unusually brilliant, and
Enilda evinced not a little curiosity to know the
names " and record " of the various envoys. Count

S described the men with his usual wit and

pungency, and Michele or Tiers could never have
equalled him in facts: he may not have been
diplomatic, but he certainly was historic. He was

interrupted by Madame de Florian, who sauntered by
on M. harcourt's arm ; one could see she was a
great favourite, for smiles followed her on every side ;
she had only just come to London, and found it
almost as much of a novelty as did Enihla. She
was dressed in a robe of genuine French make,
which showed her superb form to perfection, added
fairness to her skin, and a deeper violet to her eyes.
She even wore jewels whose colour seemed to repeat
them in clearness ; and Enilda was so puzzled to
know what they could be, that she came very near
asking the Countess to tell her about them then and
there ; that, however, would have been difficult, as the
dancing was going vigorously on, and every instant
an elbow knocked against her shoulder, a patent
leather cast a shadow on her train, or the sticks of
some vagrant fan threatened to dislocate one of lier
plumes, which up to the present had remained very
upright and stationary in her golden hair.

Just then the new American Minister passed,
and Flora nearly went into screams when she remembered
and told about a dinner he once gave
the British Minister in Washington. There wasn't a
plate that had not three Marquis's coronets on it,
painted on a shield with more quarterings than the
oldest peerage since the Conquest. His Excellency
was staggered when he saw the porcelain, and

wondered who Lad lent it for the occasion; but he
was much more staggered when he was informed
that it belonged to his host, and represented the
family he pretended to be a member of in England.
Perhaps he was; but considering even a Duke's son
bears only a title by courtesy, one wonders what
right a hundredth American cousin had to full-fledged
coronets.

Lady X was pointed out to Enilda, and her

hair reminded one of an autumn leaf, brown yesterday,
red to-day, and yellow tomorrow ; certainly her
locks were warranted to wash and change their
colour. Gossip handled the names of well-known
people most freely ; one would scarcely write in
one's diary one-tenth of the things one heard. All
Feminine London declared it to be the smartest ball
given at the palace for years  but an end conies to
most things, and this Royal entertainment closed only
too soon. The court went away before three. There
was the same craning of necks and crushing of
dresses to look at them ; other's followed, then others,
until the ball-room was deserted. Liddell packed
away his baton ; only the Yeoman of the Guard still
si 'od at the foot of the grand staircase, and the
unsmiling maids held waiting wraps in the ladies
cloak-room.

When Erttlda reached home she tore open her

letter, described all she had seen, and added this
post scriptum : 

I must say it was the loveliest ball I've ever been
to. It has just struck me I didn't dance once with
Florestan ; in fact, very little with anybody, and I'm
so tired I can't write another word. Five A.M. !  the
time I used to get up when I was a little girl, and
now just going to bed !

Dearest papa, don't say after this that you
haven't at least heard all about the party and everything.
Take care of yourself Write very soon.
Accept love from Flora and Mrs. Chromo, regards
from everybody, and a fond kiss from

Your own Enilda."

CHAPTER VII.

Two weeks had passed since the ball at Buckingham
Palace. Lady Mildred coidd not disguise to
herself the fact that of late her husband had seemed
farther and farther away from her each day ; he had
never been a passionate lover, and after this return
from America she knew that his heart was still
more estranged, but as he found her ill, presumably
on her death-bed, the change she felt in him was not
from his own showing, but her own intuition, which
told lier that absence had quenched rather than
kindled love's flame. However, from the moment of
their first meeting until he had put his hand in hers
with the vow " till death do us part," his care of her
had been unceasing, and his attentions filled with a
grave thoughtfulness which had become monotonous
in their daily sameness. She had often questioned
him of his life in America, but had elicited little
from him beyond his trip, his accident, his being

cared for by the Rozen family, and the casual friends
he had made in New York. She loved Lin passionately,
devotedly, disinterestedly, but the unvarying
excellence of his treatment of and manner towards
her, instead of sowing contentment seemed only to
sow the seeds of discord. Her life flowed on with
such cain, that she began to feel that irritation
one feels at sea when in tropical climes day follows
day, and week succeeds week, with the same constancy
of cloudless sky, dazzling sun, gentle winds,
and red gold sunsets. Lady Mildred used to say to
herself:

'' If he would only be angry with me, would
only quarrel now and then ; would refuse me when
I ask him a favour, or contradict me when I tell
him anything ! I should think then that he cared
something' for me ; but to see him oroinGf on in the
same unchanging way makes me feel as if I could
throw myself from a window, or jump into the
Thames for excitement. His kiss night and mornings
is always the same ; the tone of his voice never alters
when he says, " I hope you slept well last night,
Mildred ; I hope you feel well this morning ; " the
same courteousness before the world, the same
civility but coldness behind it. No; he does not
love me; he never loved me; he merely tolerates
me ; and I am breaking my heart for a man

who will never be any more to me than he is
now."

lady Mildred read Claremont's indifference but
too well ; he had accepted his destiny blindly, and
finding himself hopelessly entangled in the net
fate had cast for him, lived on from day to day
taking things as they came, trying to forget yesterday,
trying to ignore tomorrow. He had never
forgiven his wife the way she had won him ; he
treated her well, because it was as easy to treat her
well as badly : he was like the man who said to a
friend, " It is utterly immaterial to me whether I live
or die ; " and in response to the query, " Then why
don't you die ? " replied, " Because it is immaterial."
Claremont's indifference had reached this point when
he again met Enilda Dozen ; and since her arrival in
London he found his life an impossible one. When
alone with his wife it was all he could do to retain
his impassive calm ; before the world the task was
less difficult. That dissimulation which we absorb
with our mother's milk had become a second nature
to him, as it has to all society of men and women.
Lady Mildred had made him many unreasonable
scenes of jealousy as unwarranted as unreasonable;
for since knowing Enilda be bad never been sufficiently
interested in any one woman, in his attentions
to Tier, to ever exceed the law of accepted commonplace

and society civilities. But strange to say, the
one woman be had loved, the woman he still adored,
was his wife's chosen friend and companion, and the
only woman for whom Lady Mildred had never
seemed to feel an atom of jealousy.

It was the 21st of July, and Allison House vas
being made ready for a splendid dinner and ball,
the last important entertainment of the year, which
Lady mildred offered in special compliment to " the
belle of the season," Enilda Rozen, the '" Copper
Queen." For days it had been filled with carpenters,
florists, upholsterers, and decorators  that galaxy of
utilities who have nothing to do with the routine of
a well-ordered establishment, yet on occasions of this
kind, like the extras in an hotel bill, make a more
important item in the end, than the sum-total of
the original account. So it was that Allison House,
which it had seemed impossible to improve upon
before, came forth from these myriad artistic Lands
so beautified and embellished, as to bear no more
resemblance to its former self, than the low-necked
ball-room beauty at midnight resembles her twelve
o'clock prototype who walked in a tailor-made dress
in the Row that same morning.

John Claremont awoke in such a frame of mind
as he had not experienced for many a long day.
Had he been a working man, despair would have

been a luxury he could ill afford, but the aimlessness
of his existence, so to speak, brought with it all
that bitterness which comes to those who live without
a serious object in life. Had he been obliged
to yield obedience to any master-spirit, the material
exigencies, the duty he was bound iu honour to
yield another, would have come between himself
and any sentiment emanating from purely personal
motives and desires; but although Claremont was
his own master, and had lived a life of such absolute
selfishness in one sense, there had come, as there
always will, a momentary revulsion of feeling, and
on this particular day he had awakened with one
idea paramount in his mind. He realized that his
love for Enilda was no longer a mild sentiment,
whose emotions he could check at will, but a dominant
passion, which, like the drift of the Alpine
avalanche, would sweep) everything before it, and he
determined on this very day, on this very night, to
put her love like his own to the test.

After this decision he felt freer, and had not
been in such spirits for a long time. He spent
most of the day in his room, putting his papers
in order, and preparing for a step whose issue
meant the happiness cf one as well as wreckage of
three lives ; he was ffoinf to ask Enilda Rozen to
run away with him, and did not even calculate the

chance of her refusal. Manlike, it was impossible
for him to realize this influence could ever be less
over the woman who had once devotedly loved him.
It seemed as if the evening would never come ; and
he finally grew so impatient to see her, to hear her
voice, to touch something that belonged to lier, tithe
went to a little box long hidden from view,
dragged it to light, and took therefrom some letters
which were neither old nor musty, but were sweet,
fresh, and dainty-looking, as if they had been written
yesterday rather than a year ago. He read them
over and over again, then he put there one by one
back in the box, until all had been restored to their
former position. Suddenly he changed his mind.

"No," he thought, ''I shall take one and keep it
by me until I see her. I'll take the last." Then he
hastily run them over until he found the one, the
last she had ever written him. He had but just
taken it away from the others when he heard his
wife's voice calling him in the hall. He slipped the
letter into his pocket, closed the box, and had barely
time to put it out of sight when he heard Lady
Mildred again, this time accompanied by a tap on
the door, and the sound of the handle being softly
turned.

May I come in ? " she said in a cheery tone. " I
didn't know you were here, and I'm awfully glad, for

I want to ask your idea about something. You
know, John, you have not taken a bit of interest in
the house, and it looks so pretty : I've made the
old picture-gallery into a sort of conservatory. The
way I've arranged, it now has four exits and
entrances, but it seems so barren that I want to
divide it, and have come to ask your advice about
hanging up some tapestry curtains. The workmen
say they ought to be one way, I say another, so I
thought I'd ask you, and let you settle it. Are you
busy ? "

Oh dear no ! " he replied cheerfully. " What is it
I can do for you ? "

She came towards him, but stopped abruptly.

What a strange perfume there is 1 " She sniffed
the air daintily. " What is it ?  something new ?  it
smells like  "

Claremont flushed deeply.

Perfume !  I don't know ; isn't it the same old
thing ? White Rose or opoponax ? "

No, no ; it's a dead scent, you know, and reminds
me of a line of poetry :

' Oh, the faint sweet smell of that jessamine flower ! '

But come aloncj, the men are waitincr- there'll be
such a crush to-night."

She slipped her arm around his waist, and
VOL. ill. K

together they descended the great oaken staircase ;
she chattering in the liveliest fashion, he listening
with a smile on his lips, but a mind whose thoughts
were anywhere but there. They made their way
through numerous rooms, wearing so gay an aspect,
that even Clare mont could not refrain from expressing
his admiration ; as they neared the old
picture-gallery, he even complimented his wife on
her taste in the admirable changes she had made.
This unwonted kindness so filled her heart with joy
that she felt tears rushing into her eyes, and could
scarcely keep from throwing her arms round his
neck and telling him how much she loved him ; but
knowing how he detested scenes, she stifled all
thought of sentiment, and continued talking of the
preparations for the ball as if she had noticed
nothing unusual in his speech or tone.

"I really don't know where we'll put all the
people," she said. "You won't believe it, but I'm
already tired to death; however, Aunt Chandos-
Cressy will do the honours in the drawing-room after
dinner, and I'll slip away and get a little rest before
the ball begins."

"Ah !" thought Claremont, "that is the time I'll
ask her to see me  a most opportune moment."

By this time they had reached the gallery. It
was no longer a cold, bare place, but had been

transformed from a single room into a labyrinthine
apartment divided by screens, hangings, and lofty
palms and shrubs; arranging the tapestry-curtains
to every one's satisfaction, however, was easier said
than done. One way was tried, then another ; Lady
Mildred suggested, and the workmen explained ; but
they were readier with their tongues than their
hands, and were so clumsy that finally Claremont
mounted the ladder and adjusted them himself.
When the last touch was added, Lady Mildred cried
out with evident satisfaction :

There, that's just it, John ; now let me see," she
said, mounting a few steps on the ladder. "All
those festoons make the room look like an open rose.
Lots of places for flirtations here, eh ? Such quiet
nooks and corners ! I'll get out of your way
now. Come down. That's all right," she said to
the men, " you can go now. Thanks awfully, John.
Now I must run away;" and she moved towards
the door. " How hot you look ! " she said, casting
a backward glance on him.

Hot ! by Jove, I should think I was. As Miss
Grayson says, ' I've been working like a nigger.' Are
you going now ? "

'eyes," she said, calling through the doorway.
" I hadn't an idea it was so late. You'll
have to take your tea alone, for I'm so fagged ;

K 2

I'll get a little rest, and have a bath before
dinner."

Instead of my tub," he called after her, " I'm
having a Turkish bath up here."

Then he pulled his handkerchief from his pocket,
began mopping his brow, and idly took in the
result of his late exertions. He was so busily
occupied that he did not observe a paper he had
taken out with his handkerchief, which had fluttered
silently down and settled unperceived at the roots
of one of the palm-trees. Without giving another
glance around he quitted the apartment. He intended
taking a turn before dinner in the Park, but
was interrupted by the arrival of an old college
friend, whose unexpected visit, although not most
opportune, gave him so much pleasure that time
fairly flew, and so engrossed were they by reminiscences
of the past, that even the dressing-bell rang
unheeded. Urging upon his friend to come in good
time for the evening, he flew to his room, and in
frantic haste began to dress.

Before Lady Mildred went to the drawing-room,
womanlike, she bestowed one last look round to see
that everything was in proper order. Passing
through the rooms she gave a second glance to her
improvised conservatory, and felt proud of the skill
and taste shown in its arrangement. She was just

saying to herself, " How dodge it all looks," when
she caught sight of a white object gleaming through
the shrubs near one of the palms. She hastily
picked it up, and saw it was a letter in Enilda
Rozen's handwriting, beginning, " Dearest."

She put her hand to her head, and a vague
indefinite pain shot through her heart. " What can
it be ? " she thought ; " to whom can it be addressed ?
But before she could read further, Flora and Mrs.
Chromo appeared in the doorway. She hastily thrust
the paper into her pocket. They were both talking
and praising the beauty of the house, and Flora
added :

As we have remarked in London, everybody
arrives from a quarter of an hour to an hour late for
dinner. I bet Lucy a dozen of Bertin's best, that if,
like good Americans, we strolled in in strict time,
not only should we be the first, but not even the
hostess would be ready to receive us ; and you see
how it is."

Lady Mildred smiled good-humouredly, shook
hands with them, and making the slightest sort of
an apology they proceeded to the drawing-room.
In spite of Flora's prediction no one was more than
half an hour late, and soon they were all seated at a
brilliant table, where Lady Mildred took her place
with Florestan at her risfht. As the dinner was

given to Enilda, Claremont, according to American
custom, would have placed her on his right. On the
contrary, he was obliged to take in the first lady in
rank in the room ; but was agreeably surprised to
find that Enilda, on the arm of the Count, was
happily seated on his immediate left.

Lady Mildred never could tell how she got
through the dinner. Lons before it finished, her
eyes wandered in her husband's direction, and
each time he seemed just at that moment to be
in earnest conversation with Enilda ; even seemed
pleading with her for something, for she suddenly
lifted her head and answered his question by an
affirmative nod. In that last movement a veil
seemed suddenly torn from Lady Mildred's eyes.

I see it all now," she murmured ; " his coldness
to me, his going off to America ; his return and
altered manner after having lived in that girl's house
are proof enough. How blind I have been !  oh,
how blind, how idiotic ! "

Her only thought now was to get away from table
and read the letter. It seemed as if the courses
would never finish ; the dessert was endless ; but at
last she saw her way clear to give the signal for
rising. To her surprise Florestan offered his
arm.

It is the American fashion," he explained, half-apologetically;

"I brought you in, and must see you
safe out again."

'what'" she said, half faintly; "you don't want
to stop with the men ? You don't want to smoke ?

\-r })

lOU

Indeed I do not. I'll take you to the drawing-room."


"Yes," cried Flora; "you'll be the lion in a den
of Daniels. We don't want you."

At that moment Miss Chances-Cressy took her
cue from her niece's tired expression and pale face.
I am sure you're tired, Mildred," she said ; " you
must let me replace you while you take a little rest."

Why, naturally," cried Flora, Mrs. Chromo, and
others in a breath ; and the former added, " a day
like this is enough to break up a washerwoman."

Lady Mildred murmured her thanks, and said
she would retire for a little while. She was burning
to read the letter, and scarcely heard Florestan ashe
said compassionately :

Do accept my arm. You look so pale ; are you
ill ? Don't mind me. The house is so lovely I shall
lose myself in these beautiful rooms, and think I amin
Fairyland. Are you sure there is not an Aladdin's
lamp concealed somewhere ? " Then he kissed Lady
Mildred's hand with stately grace as he left her at
the door of the drawings-room.

Lady Mildred flew to her own apartments, and
with trembling Anglers took the letter from her
pocket. She turned np the gas, and full under its
limit, with beating heart and dilated eves, read it
from beginning to end ; then it suddenly struck her
that she had not once seen her husband's name.
Perhaps it was not addressed to him ; but, then,
how came it into his possession ? But had it been
in his possession ? The events of the day then
rapidly passed before her  as in a vision she saw her
husband mounting the ladder to arrange the tapestry
curtains, and she heard him say, " By Jove, how hot
it is!"** "That is it," she said; "he has been shut
up in his room all day reading old letters, he put
this one in his pocket, and drew it out with his
handkerchief when he complained of the heat, and
it fell at the foot of the palm-tree. He will look for
it first in his coat which he changed for dinner, and
not finding it he'll so back to the conservator to
look for it;  he'll go there. Ah, if I only knew
when ;  perhaps he will go now. \Yhat better time
than the present ? At any rate, I have a clear
hour before me ; I shall go there myself and hide ina
corner, and if he comes in to look for anything I
shall then know the letter was addressed to him.
First, I must give orders to my maid that I am not
to De disturbed"'

In the mean time Florestan wandered from one
room to another, until he found himself in the old
picture-gallery which Lady Mildred's ingenuity had
transformed into so fantastic a creation ; he broke a
tiny waxen flower from a full-blown tree that stood
in a corner, and took the blossom tenderly in his
hands.

"It looks like her face," he murmured, "as rare,
as fair, as sweet, as daintily cut; what if I should
ask her the great question to-night, and  why not
in this very room ? At least I may imagine she is
coming, and sit down in the shadow of this curtain
to dream of her. If this flower really were an
Aladdin's lamp, and by wishing I could realize all
my heart's desires, I should ask for her love and bethe
happiest man on earth."

Espying a half-rustic divan that might have
tempted even an Endymion to repose, he threw
himself upon it, the curtain concealed his recumbent
form, and he was soon lost in visionary dreams of
Enilda.

Lady Mildred having given orders not to be disturbed,
had stealthily left her room, and by means
of an almost disused passage found herself by
one sudden turning, at the further end of the conservatory.
She had barely hidden herself when she
heard not only approaching footsteps but voices.

and to her surprise her husband came towards
her.

Her heart gave a jump, and seemed to leap into
her throat, but sure of her hiding-place she stifled
her emotions and chilly watched Claremont.

He looked cautiously around. " There's no one
here," he said quickly. " Come in ; I told you I
must see you alone."

A smile of triumph lit up Lady Mildred's face as
she saw Enilda Rozen come in through the doorway.
She was deathly pale, and her eyes burned with
a wild light, yet never had she looked so lovely.
Her dress of soft crape trailed mysteriously after
her, the dimly-lighted conservatory, the flickering
shadows from the waving palms and fantastic
tapestries seemed to envelop her with a something
so unreal, so unearthly, that Lady Mildred wondered
if she were really standing before her, or if she
herself were not the dupe of her own over excited
imagination. No; it was no deception, no delusion;
at that instant Claremont spoke again :

Can you have been so blind as not to have seen
all along how I loved you  how I adored you ? "

Stop," she said faintly, placing her hands before
her eyes and walking towards him as one walks
in a dream. " I cannot realize that you  you of
all the world  are saying this to me. Surely I

have fallen very low in your estimation ; you can
have very little respect for me after what has passed
between us to say again, ' I love you. ' "

"Ah!" gasped Lady Mildred, "after what has
passed between them. I thought as much. God
help me not to betray myself, but to hear them
through to the end."

Florestan was awakened from his reverie in a
manner he had little imagined. Hearing voices he
cautiously lifted his head and was about to reveal
himself, when to his horror he saw John Claremont
seize Enilda's hand and throw himself on his knees
at her feet. To listen was unworthy, to retire was
impossible ; a thousand thoughts flashed through his
mind, the first of which was, "She does not love me,"
and seemed to place all her indifference and coldness
before his eyes in their true meaning. " My heart is
broken," he groaned ; " at least, whatever I may be
compelled to overhear, I will never look upon her
face again." Then sinking wearily back on his now
disenchanted couch, he buried his face in his hands.

"Enilda," said Claremont, seizing her hands and
covering them with . passionate kisses, " for God's
sake hear me. I swear to you I loved you ; I swear
to you I never have loved, I never shall love another
woman. Fate came between us  a bitter Fate ; and
yet, so help me heaven, I was innocent."

She tried to disengage her hands.

Hush ! " she said in a breathless voice, " hush !
sou forget yourself,  you forget me,  you forget
your wife. I must not, will not, listen to you,  let
me go."

No ; you shall not go till you have heard all I
have got to say."

You are mad, I tell you. Unhand me ; I must
go. What if we are overheard ? Can you realize
what you are doing ? What if some one were to
come in ? "

No one can come in from three entrances at
least," he said brutally, '"'for I have locked the
doors. If they come they must face us ;  and you,
can you deny that you still remember the past? 
that you once loved me  that you still love me ?"

The past ! " In spite of herself the wild look left
her eyes, and a tender flush stole over her face
making it soft and roseate, as a cloud that is kissed
by the dawn. "The past!" she murmured. "Ah,
if I only could forget it !  that I loved you, John
Claremont ? Yes ; that I shall never deny  that I
love you still ? " She laughed a bitter laugh. " If
we are to go by the Away of the world, I ought to
adore you. You have treated me badly enough ; 
but who shall say whether I do or do not love ? At
least you have no right to question me."

I have a right," he answered, his Ups again
touching her hand. " A triple right ; that of love in
the past, of adoration in the present, and devotion for
the future. I am yours; you shall do with me as
you will."

And I was once yours, and I gave you my whole
heart when you appreciated me, and it is so little
that you left me with the words ' For ever ' on your
lips, and went straight away and married another
woman : that, too, without ever even telling me
the reason why. You wrote me a letter;  such a
letter ! I have it still, and whenever I find myself
in danger of thinking too much of any man, I read
it over."

Spare me," he murmured ; " for God's sake spare
me. He alone knows what it cost me to write that
letter."

Enilda violently wrenched her hands from his, and
uplifting them impressively said :

'' And what it cost me to read it ! Oh, it was the
old story. You gave no reason for changing ; you had
no need to ; you simply preferred another woman tome,
and you took a perfectly straightforward way
of telling me of it. I can't complain. I never complained.
Am I the first woman who has been
abandoned by a so-called lover? Was the art of
deception invented for you any more than the gift of

credulity was invented for me?  and yet  and yet,
you never can know how truly I loved you. This is
probably the last time we shall ever meet. I am not
so weak as to wish it. nor you so base as to wish to
bring it about. I will tell you now, if you care to
hear it, how I received your letter. I was so sure
that you loved me as I loved you, that I read it
through and thrush before I could realize its
meaning, and even then cried to myself, ' There is
some mistake, some fearful dream ; it can't be true ;
he is only trying me ; he wants to see if I love him.
He another woman's husband ! No ! I cannot believe
it, and yet?  how could you jest so cruelly? You
wonder if I suffered ?  I knew not where to put my
head for very shame. My veins ran fire and ice,
and my eyes  I could not see out of them; they
were bursting  bursting : there were do tears, only
thousands of grains of sand cut like needles into the
bal's. I could not cry ; even that woman's resource
was denied me ; tears used to well up in my heart
to flow back again in blood, without once having
wet the lids of my poor dazed eyes. Ah, it was
because I had tried to see too much. I had strained
my eyes to look upon a prospect of happiness that
rarely comes to mortals, and like the one who would
gaze upon the immortal, my temerity was punished.
It seemed so little, the happiness of but two people

ill all this great universe  yours and mine ! why
in all this world of misery could not two poor
creatures hope to be exempt from the common
lot ? Days passed. I tried to think, but could not
realize what would become of me; I only used to
repeat to myself as each sun rose and set, ' I shall
not see him to-day, nor tomorrow, nor yet the day
after. I must wake in the morning, and go to sleep
at night ; ' always thinking, ' I love him ; he is alive,
yet deaf to me. I shall never see him again ; his
words were nothing, only so many lies, and his vows
and kisses, lies,  all lies.' As I took up my life
at sunrise my prayer was forgetfulness ; at sunset,
oblivion. Oh, sir, I was too poor, too weak a
creature to have been honoured with so rich a jest ; 
only a miner's daughter, and yet you treated me as
you might have treated a woman of the world."
Enilda, for heaven's sake spare me."
Spare you ! You had the world to choose from,
why not have spared me ? One poor creature, whose
worst fault was loving you but too well  that was it
perhaps. I did not mask my love, I let you see it
too plainly ; but how could I hide what everyone
seemed to see ? Charlotte  and the gardener,
and even that old man Ricard, whenever he looked
at me, seemed to know that I was thinking of you.
I was so happy ; but you  you have never known

what it is to love, or you could never have thrown
away such a love as mine ! Why, I was yours,
body and soul. You became such a part of my daily
life, that in every man's face I saw your face ; in
every voice I heard your voice ; in every song of
nature I heard the music of my love for you, and
your answering love for me ; in every book I opened
I only read your name ; every word I spelled only
said, ' He loves me and we will be happy together ! '
Now that I have everything in the world, I know
how little, yet how much I asked of Fate. Then I
would have been your slave ; you might have beaten,
or starved, or kicked me. I would have accepted
all for one crumb of love : I would have gone
hungry and cold, and have begged in the streets,
only to have been always by your side. Before you
went away I knew that my father's position was
changed, but I said, ' This money which has come at
last, which came yesterday, well, it may go tomorrow
for all I care ; he loves me for what I am, and
all I ask is his love.' Then when I realized that
your letter was true, my heart was deader, colder,
heavier, than any leaded sack which has ever leapt
into the sea. Then when I could think  "

Stop ! " he cried. " I can bear no more. Can
you pretend that if you loved me as you say you did,
such a love can be dead ?  that one short year can

have so blotted out a past that not one trace of the
old feeling is left ? Do you think I, too, can have
forgotten it ? A fatal chain of circumstances made
me a villain in your eyes and my own. You ask
me to tell you why ; alas ! I cannot tell you without
betraying a woman, and that woman  "

"Hush" she said; "her name should be sacred.
Do not intrude it in such a scene as this. Now let
me go."

No ; not until you have heard me. Oh, Enilda,
what I have suffered since our parting no words can
ever tell ! I tried to forget you; I tried to accept my
fate ; to live an honest life, and be if not a loving, at
least a faithful, husband to the woman I had married.
I had so schooled myself into saying, ' She is dead tome
for ever,' that even my memories of you became
like the flowers we place on the grave of our dead ;
but when a relentless destiny threw you again
in my path, I felt from the first, that my year of
agony of patience and of striving had gone for nothing.
Do you think in that first sound of your voice, in
that first look into your eyes, in that first hand-clasp,
I, too, did not live over and over again every moment
of our past ? Oh, Enilda, do you think forgetfulness
is so easily bought ? Believe me, love in this world
is everything. Don't be cruel; you still care forme
; I throw myself at your feet ; let us give up the

VOL. III. L

world, and live only for each other. We vill go back
to Laramie, and re-live the old life ; to the little
lantern-like room overlooking the wide, dear river ;
and the soft air, perfumed with a thousand happy
odours; to hear the murmuring reeds and rushes
under the old bridge, and see the moon from her
sapphire sea, entangle the weeds and water-lilies in
her long silver shafts, magic cypher which only lovers
can read. Enilda, will you come ? can't you see
two figures leaning on a balcony overlooking the
river, their lips and e3'es meeting, their arms roundabout
each other, their very shadows one, their very
sighs breathing a love eternal as eternity. Those
two figures, Enilda, are yours and mine ; those
vows, those kisses, those transports are yours and
mine. You were my first love. Fate has again
thrown us together, you must be my last."

"No, no; you were faithless; all is changed; 
and  and as things are now, I do not res-ret the
past."

Not regret the past !  and as things are now ;
what do you mean ? "

I mean," she said, slowly pushing him from her
and gazing steadily into his face ; " I mean that I no
longer love you ; that every word we have said tonight
is an insult to your wife, although, God
knows, I never dreamed when I consented to see

you that we ever should have spoken as we have.
It is true I have often feared that some time 
some explanation must come between you and me.
It has come ;  it is passed. Know, John Claremont,
that I love your wife dearly; and she  Heaven help
her !  she loves you. I shall never willingly see
you again, even if by so doing I could buy a perfect
future ; for I have so suffered myself, that I would
never purchase one hour's happiness at the expense
of another woman's broken heart. Even were I to
love you  which  I do not  I  "

Speak ! You repeat, and to me, that you no
longer love me !  that your love, such a love, is dead ?
No, no; I'll not believe it." In his anger and
unbelief he laughed almost aloud.

I am to blame for coming ;  I have struggled
with myself since our meeting on the steamer. I
could not analyze my feelings. The sentiment I
took for remembrance, was merely the bitterness of a
self-love, a self-esteem which had been too cruelly
wounded for any true woman easily to forget. I tell
you plainly, for the last time, when I heard you say,
Let us live for each other,' I realized then, John
Claremont, that I do not love you,  you may
believe me or not  I do not love you ; I  I love
another. Forget me ; go back to your wife, and tell
her"

L 2

"And tell her," he interrupted fiercely, "the
truth, perhaps?  "

Which she already knows," said Lady Mildred,
suddenly throwing aside the curtain, and as suddenly
revealing herself to their astonished gaze.

Enilda screamed, but did not attempt to move ; the
sudden apparition seemed to freeze her into stone.

Florestan, startled by Enilda's shriek, rushed forward,
but either his footfall was so licht or their
excitement so intense, that none of the three perceived
him : Lady Mildred continued,

My husband could not speak against a woman,
but there is no reason why a woman may not speak
against herself. My presence here to-night was not
undesigned. I found this,"  she held up Enilda's
letter in her trembling fingers ;  " I could not help
reading it, and I felt that apprehension a woman
always feels \xhen on the brink of some calamity.
I had a fatal presentiment that all my destiny
was written in those lines. Miss Rozen, you wrote
that letter to a man whom I tricked into marrying
me.

** Mildred," began her husband, " for God's sake  "

Do not stop me," she said, looking at him coldly
and scornfully ; " Miss Rozen's frankness at least
deserves mine."

At this point Florestan, in honour, could no longer

conceal himself. He stepped forward. Lady Mildred
was the first to perceive him ; she evinced no surprise.
Enilda, who seemed still under the influence of some
horrid dream, saw him as one sees in a vision, whilst
Claremont murmured to himself: " Flore stan ! He
too has heard all;"  and before the former could
step forward to demand, or the latter to explain
his position, Lady Mildred spoke again :

"It is just that he too should know all; and
I repeat, I tricked my husband into marrying me. I
feigned an accident which never happened; an illness
which fell upon me only in imagination ; and a
possible death of which I stood in no peril. You will
ask why I did all this ? It is very simple. I loved
him ; I felt him drifting each day farther from me,
and determined to win him at any cost. I did  at
a great one ; but I thought once married that my
love would beget at least some responsive passion ;
that when he realized how much I cared for him he
would grow to like me. I did not know what had
happened, and,  and I never dreamed until  I read
this letter, that he had in any way ever bound
himself to another."

At that moment the joyous strains of the Blue
Danube waltz burst forth. Lady Mildred started, and
pressed her hand to her forehead in a dazed manner.

Ah ! " she exclaimed. " It is true I have a ballon

to-night. I had quite forgotten; can it be so
late ? But what have our private feelings to do
with the role we must play before the world ? I am
not the only woman who must take a broken heart
into the glare of flaring lights, the crush and din of
an indifferent throng  " At this juncture Florestan
stepped forward.

"Excuse me, Miss Rozen, this house is no longer
a place for you ; allow me to conduct you to your
carriage."

Enilda advanced a step, but was stopped by Lady
Mildred's tremulous voice and outstretched hand.

Miss Rozen," she said, " believe me, whenever or
wherever we may meet, I shall cherish for you the
warmest feelings of admiration, friendship, and gratitude.
You are not to blame for this night's work
any more than I, or perhaps even my husband. I
see now that no one can escape his destiny. Ah !
the music again ! I am sure if you have any regard
for me, you will not go away now ; as the only favour
you can ever do me will be to save a scandal here
to-night; we must all play our parts a few hours
more, we will at least open the ball together, and
after that  "

Enilda bowed assent to her ladyship's words,
placed an icy hand upon Florestan's, and stepped
forward. Lady Mildred made way for them to pass.

"After you," she said, smiling curiously; then
turned to her husband with the same strange
look.

Mr. Clare mont, perhaps for the last time  your
arm ? "

CHAPTER YIIL

Although the excitement of this eventful evening
had been enough to upset the strongest-minded
person, Enilda, who had heretofore betrayed but
little of the heroic in her nature, on this occasion
proved that she was made of the stuff that models
heroes, not cowards. The revulsion of her own
feelings on listening to Clare mont's outburst, the
final letting go of that cable which up to an hour
ago had anchored the present to the past, the shock
of Lady Mildred's appearance and Florestan's discovery
of her long-hidden secret, were such vivid
realities, that like the brightest flash of lio-htnino-
before she had completely realized their portent,
they had as completely ceased to be. An hour ago
might have been yesterday  or dead with seven
thousand years.

She never knew how she left the ball-room nor
how she reached home : as she re-entered her
house she was met at the door by Charlotte Cardan,

whose face expressed the liveliest anxiety and concern.
She began talking at once, expressing her
surprise at Miss 'Nilda's getting home so much
.eciriier than usual.

A messenger has been twice to seek you," she
said ; " he left a note and 'claimed it was a matter of
life and death ; but you look pale, honey chile."

"Yes, I feel faint, Charlotte; get me a glass of
wine ; and what about a letter ? "

Take off your things first," she urged, but this
Euilda declined to do, and sinking into a chair hastily
opened the envelope. As she read a cry escaped
her. The letter was as follows :

You are a woman, Enilda Rozen, and I know,
although sou can't have any love for me, you won't
refuse to go to any one in trouble, certainly not to
a compatriot who is ill  perhaps dying  'in a strange
land. For Heaven's sake come to me as soon as you
get this. I have a terrible story to tell you. Come
alone ; or, if you will, bring a servant with you, but
neither Flora nor Mrs. Chromo ; some way I could
not bear to see them ; but you  you've always
heaped coals of fire on ray head, and I turn to you
as the only woman in idiom I can confide. Lose no
time, for my strength is fast leaving me.

"Ida Forrester."

Enilda read and re-read the letter. At first she
thought it a trick, but at last was convinced of its
sincerity. Charlotte returned with the wine, which
she swallowed at a draught, and then announced
that she was going out that very moment, and bade
her put on her things to accompany her. On
their way to Forestii's house she explained as much
as she knew, and for the first time noticed that the
negress's face wore a strange look. She eagerly
questioned her, but Charlotte responded only vaguely
until so pressed by Enilda that she said :

Yes ; something has happened, Miss 'Nilda dear.
Have patience ; you can't know no more to-night. It
contains all on us ; but good news '11 keep, and bad
conies fast enough. Wild horses won't fetch nothing'
more from me now, so just simmer down, and in good
time you'll know all about it."

Enilda was so wrapped up in thoughts of Ida
Forrester, and speculations as to the nature of the
confidences she was about to hear, that she did not
insist upon Charlotte's explaining further. They
threaded their way through dismal streets; for although
it was barely midnight the great city wore
a strangely deserted aspect, and the occasional lamps
were about as sufficient to light up London, as a
single signal to light up the Atlantic. A light
vapour streamed up from the earth ; it was neither

fog nor mist, but that indescribable blueish atmosphere
common to London between the hours of
twelve and two : which thickens and renders indistinct
street corners, and makes the various houses
in their facings of brown or white or grey, stand
forth in the haze like spectres haunting a death-strewn
battle-field.

At last they reached Forestii's house, one of those
prolific mansions redolent of lodgings, in the neighbourhood
of Bloomsbury Square. The house was
very dimly lighted from the front, but from the
windows of the second story a steady light seemed
to indicate the sick woman's room. In a few
moments Enilda and Charlotte were admitted to a
lofty chamber, where on a bed in the corner of the
room lay the poor opera-singer. The pillow was
scarcely whiter than her cheek ; and her long black
hair seemed to curl in endless serpentine rings on
the pillow ; her eyes burned with a strange brightness
; and her lips, from which every vestige of colour
had fled, twitched nervously, keeping company with
her hands, which incessantly plucked at the coverlet :
this was elaborately trimmed with lace, and to
Enilda's surprise a large coronet and monogram were
conspicuous in the centre. A night-lamp was on a
table beside the bed, and standing beside this table,
in a respectful attitude, was Fraulein Marx, the lady

companion. Enilda bowed civilly to her, and went
straight to Ida ; she took one hand in hers, kissed
her cheek, and said tenderly :

You were right to send for me ; I am more
grieved than I can tell to find you in this state."

Ida attempted to speak, but no words came ; tears
only rolled from her large black eyes and sank
silently into the frills of her night-dress.

Don't try to speak now," said Enilda. " I shall
not leave you ; I only want to know how to help you,
to befriend you if you need a friend."

Ida murmured a few words about forgiveness 
about the past and the old school in Chicago ;  then
Enilda began to take off her things, and wdjen she
had removed her last wrap, sank down by the bedside
and caressingly took Ida's hands.

You must not worry or fret, dear ; perhaps things
are not so bad as you think. You are with friends,
and you must not tell me anything now, because
you're ill, that  that you might be sorry for after-war
Js; 1 mean when you get well, you know, things
may seem different."

Ida shook her head wearily, and made an effort
to rise from her pillow. Both Enilda and Fraulein
sprang forward to help her ; but assuming a strange
energy she waved the latter from her with a gesture
of such horror and loathing: that Enilda raised her

eyes in wonder. The movement lent the same
energy to her voice, for she almost screamed as she
said :

Don't let her touch me, don't let her come near
me, she is the bane of my life ; I look upon her as
the cause of all my misfortunes. Don't stop me now,
Enilda; while I have the strength, I must tell you
everything."

At this moment Fraulein Marx came close to the
bedside.

Miss Rozen," she said, " I beg you will pay no
attention to her ravings, she is utterly mad. She has
had a fever, which has left her in such a state of
mind that she is not responsible for her words. She
has quarrelled with me, with her best friend ; she
has got hold of a letter which I held in my possession,
addressed not to me but to some one else ; she read
it, and her imagination has run away with her to
such an extent she almost calls white black."

Enilda looked up coldly. Charlotte, who had been
sitting in a distant corner of the room, drew her
chair nearer to the bedside.

"I scarce know what to believe," said Enilda
haughtily; "your words are strong enough, Fraulein,
and yet, I'm sure Ida knows perfectly what she is
saying."

'that I do," said the sick woman, quickly. "I've

sent for you because I want you to help me.
It's no use, Fraulein Marx, you saying I am
mad, and trying to shut me up. I haven't a
friend in the world, Enilda, and I'll tell you
everything."

Ida then began with a voice which was fairly
strong at first, but dropped steadily lower as she
proceeded with her story. She went back to the
time she first came to Europe to study, told of her
trials and hardships, the dog's life she had to lead
on the stage, and the people she had to cringe and
make up to, from a parson to a penny-aliter : she
said when she knew there was no couleur de rose
about the stage, she still loved it; its fascination
was so much more than its degradation, that she had
never resented the career she had chosen. At last

o

she spoke of Ems. " You won't believe it, Enilda,"
she continued in a sobbing voice ; " but I was so
alone, so friendless, that I did as many another
woman has done before me."

Enilda pressed her hand softly. " Don't go on,
dear," she said, " it will tire you too much. I know
what you are going to say."

It isn't as bad as that, Enilda,  only perhaps it
is, for it has turned out the same. I met him, and
finally consented to a secret marriage."

Enilda drew away her hand, then instinctively

put it back again. " And so you are married," she
said softly. " Go on."

Ah ! married  yes ; but can't you understand, it
was all a wretched farce ? I used to beg him to
acknowledge me, to give me my proper position
before the world as his wife. He never would. I
can't say that he ill-treated me, but of late he had
changed so much that I felt he no longer loved me.
His ways became mere and more mysterious, until
finally the other day he brutally told me never again
to speak of his acknowledging my marriage, and
in spite of my tears abandoned me when I was
wretchedly ill in New York. But that's not all. Oh I
Enilda, I'm not his wife at all; he's married to
another woman, and Fraulein Marx knows all about
it, for I've found some letters in her possession,
written by my husband years ago, and addressed,
My dearest wife.' "

Enilda started up. " Great Heaven ! can it be
possible ? The wretch ! to so ruin and betray a helpless
girl !  but are you sure,  quite sure ? This is a
dreadful charge to bring against any man. Is this
true ? " And she turned abruptly to Fraulein Marx.

The Fraulein's face was impassive. " I told, you
she was raving," she replied ; " but what if I were to
say. Yes, it is true ? "

At this Ida broke into frantic sobbing. She

turned her head on her pillow, and wejDt so bitterly
that for a few moments Enilda was afraid she would
do herself some harm.

It is too late now," she murmured ; " but it is
so hard to have misspent my life, to die when I am
so young, just when I thought I had a bright future
spreading out before me. The Fraulein says I have
killed myself, because I took on so when I realized
the awful truth : I broke a blood-vessel at the
same time I broke my heart. What have I to
live for? He can't marry me now, and I am disgraced
for ever."

There you're wrong," said Enilda. " You have
everything to live for, above all to punish the man
who has so betrayed you, and to prove to the world
that your misfortune was not your fault."

Fraulein Marx stood still impassive by the bedside,
but Charlotte Corday's head was bowed upon her
bosom, and stifled sobs shook her old withered
form. Ida was calmer, and her head was half-losing
on Euilda's bosom, when the door suddenly opened,
and a man entered the apartment. Enilda looked
up. " What does this intrusion mean ? " she cried, 
what  ? " But the words died on her lips as she
recognized in the intruder the Count de Marcie and
D'Orbach.

"You!" she cried, her arm still supporting Ida's

head. " Can anything have happened,  Flora ! Mrs.
Chromo ! Lady Mildred ? "

He stepped forward gallantly with hat in hand.
A light half-opened summer overcoat disclosed the
irreproachable dress-suit, and still more faultless
gardenia which adorned his button-hole. He bowed
with pantomimic assurance, and in the most casual
manner in the world came towards the bed whereon
Ida was lying. Enilda flushed and half-arose ; his
manner was in itself an offence.

He made her no answer.

You do not speak," she cried ; "what means your
appearance at this hour, in this place ? "

At this point Ida raised her head, and pointing a
finger, slowly murmured,

It is but natural, a husband may seek his wife
at any hour; but he  he is no more my husband
than I am  "

What do you mean ? " cried Enilda. " Ida,
speak ! It can't be true ;  this  this then is the
wretch who betrayed you ? "

The Count stopped short in the middle of the
room; his face wore an expression of mingled rage
and astonishment. He swore a vile oath, then
rushing forward, seized Ida by the hand.

What do you mean ? " he cried. " Haven't I
been tormented enough of late, without the addition

VOL. III. M

of your infernal whining and nonsense ? So you've
told her ! A pretty mess, truly  and you think I will
forgive such a breach of faith as that ? No  never;
and if you were to get well tomorrow, and I were a
thousand times free, I wouldn't marry you."

Fraulein Marx came forward and pulled him away
from Ida by main force.

Are you drunk or crazy ! " she cried. " Be careful,
be careful ; another syllable may be too much."

Shocked and disgusted, Enilda prepared to leave
the room; but Ida implored her not to go away.
The Count, evidently under the influence of liquor,
turned to the sick woman with such brutality
of gesture and manner that she felt her very soul
sicken as she gazed upon him, and before she knew
how it came about, she had thrust him from the
bedside and stood between him and the girl he had
so foully wronged.

"Ha, Miss Rozen!" he laughed; 'the Copper
Queen,'  perhaps some day we will not give ourselves
such airs."

Sir," cried Enilda, " leave the room this instant,
your very presence is an insult to an honest woman ;
as far as I am concerned, never dare to speak to or
address me again. Know that I shall have this
matter thoroughly sifted ; the world shall hear of
your vileness. Ida henceforth is under my protection

;  no  perhaps I am too harsh ; I do not think
you are yourself now, but if you are a gentleman
and have one spark of honour left tell me the truth :
Is or is she not your wife ? "

I am as sick of subterfuge as she is," he replied
angrily. " My wife ! No ;  and never was."

Whilst lie was speaking no one had noticed
Charlotte Corday, who had gradually drawn near,
and w\s staring at him with wild dilated eyes ; her
face wore the same livid look Enilda had twice
seen upon it, and suddenly she began to speak:
her voice sounded hoarse and unnatural whilst she
cried :

Come home, honey chile, come home ; don't go
for to mixing' yer self up in odder folkes affairs."

The Count turned towards her with a hard laugh,
which rang out awfully in the hushed room.

"That's right, Auntie, take her home," he said;
there are some people whose affairs she had best
let alone  I am one of those people."

I shall never let you alone' cried Enilda,
until I see justice done. I will tell the world  "

"No, no, honey chile, come home," pleaded old
Charlotte.

Ida," asked Enilda, " what do you wish ?  shall I
go or stay ? "

Fraulein Marx answered for the singer.

M 2

I think, Miss Rozen," she said civilly, " that
you had best go ; the doctor ordered quiet. This
scene is enough to make even a well woman ill.
Trust me : I am her friend, although she doesn't
know it, and refuses to believe it."

Enilda," said a faint voice.

In an instant she flew to the bedside.

"Ida dear, what is it?" she cried, throwing her
arm tenderly around her. " Do you wish me to go
now ? Tell the truth ; I'll come to you again in the
morning, but not if he is here. Think well before
you send me away. Can I trust you alone with 
with them ? "

Put your ear down close to mine," said Ida
softly. " Go now, dear, it's better so ; and remember
that whatever happens I've told you the truth. I've
been vain and foolish, but not wicked. I thought I
should be a royal countess, and now  and now;  kiss
me just once, Enilda ; I've never been worthy of you,
of your friendship, but I ask it for  for to-night
anyway. I can't thank you enough for coming ; God
won't overlook your goodness to me."

Enilda felt the tears coming; she strusfo-led
vainly, but they would fall. She signed to Charlotte
to fetch her wraps, and giving Ida one
more kiss, one more hand-press, turned to leave the
room.

The Count mockingly stood aside to let lier pass,
whilst Franklin Marx had resumed her old position
at the little table.

This scion of a royal race bowed his Versailles
bow as Enilda reached the doorway. His
heartlessness and whole manner were so loathsome
that she could not forbear turning back once
more.

Do not think, sir," she said, " that this night
shall ever be forgotten. To you at least I and mine
say good-bye for ever."

"You think so; alas, I fear that this is not a
case of what woman wills, etc.; for I, on the contrary,
have already forgotten your words, your very
presence here this evening ; as my friend Isabella  I
beg her pardon. Her Majesty  said when she left
Spain, ' I distinctly do not say good-bye for ever ;
but  au re voir.' "

As soon as Enilda reached home Charlotte
Corday put a little paper in her hands. It was
a telegram.

Ye muss jess read dat, honey chile ; for now's the
time, and bear up under it. Massa Rozen needs us ;
he sent it to me."

"My God!" interrupted Enilda, "what has
happened ?  surely misfortunes never come singly."
She snatched the paper and read :

Tell Enikla that I am ruined  disgraced ; break
it to ber; take the next steamer bone without fail
if you still love me.

'eric Rozen."

Enilda folded the missive in ber fingers.

Is that all, Charlotte ? I  I thought be was
dead. Ruined !  what is that to me ? Money never
brought us any happiness. Disgraced ?  that be
could never be in my eyes. Ob Charlotte. let uo
leave London at once and go to bim ; let us go
tomorrow morning. I am ill, miserable, unhappy ;
everything bas gone wrong ;  ob, let us go away ! "

Enilda fell rather than flung herself on to the
negress's broad bosom.

"Honey chile, don't take on like dot ; saint ye got
me and yer sadder en yer frees all jess de same ?
Chair up, en we'll be off quicken a possum ud skip
a gum-stump; but Miss Flora, en  en Miss Lucy
bow 'bout dem ? "

"about dem," said a voice at the door. "They're
bere to speak for themselves." Flora appeared.
"Enilda, what on earth happened at the ball, you
disappeared so early ? Lady Mildred said you bad a
bad headache and might be lying down ; then when
you didn't turn up at the last we grew anxious, and
sbe explained calmly that sbe feared you bad returned

home ;  said it in the coolest way I ever saw.
You know dien you come down to it and want to
know anything from an Englishwoman she doesn't
want you to find out, you might as well question the
rock of Gibraltar. Of course we stayed to the end,
and I may say I never spent a more gorgeous
evening. I have more cotillon trinkets than  why,
what's the matter ? "

Flora stopped as suddenly as she had begun. Ina
few moments she would have been told all, but
Charlotte peremptorily stopped Enilda's talking.

Read this, Miss Flora," she said, handing her the
cablegi'am. " Read dot, case you 're a friend." Then
she whispered to Enilda and forbade her speaking
of Ida. " I lev reasons, honey chile, wich I'll
gub yer later on  trust old Charlotte, she knows
best." She was interrupted by Flora :

"Well, I repose we'll chip off tomorrow. I say
we, for you don't imagine I'll let you go alone,
do you, Enilda? Not I, although I haven't seen
the Tower, or the Crown Jewels, or the Church
where there is a tablet to Lady Jane Grey, or the
field of the forty footsteps. Thank Heaven, I have
done Madame Toussaud's, otherwise I could not
leave London. Enilda, cheer up. What's a failure
in America ?  only one more stepping-stone to
success. Pa's the only man who's never failed,

because be never amounted to anytliin] more than
respectable citizenship, and he always bad a blind
sort of luck wblcb even helped bim on in that.
Ruin ! disgrace !  nonsense ; the words ought to be
struck out of the American vocabulary''

Flora chattered on; kissed and caressed Enilda
until the latter even smiled.

"Lucy's in bed," she added, "and I wouldn't be
here, but I was so hungry; give me a dinner and
ball the same night for pure starvation diet; so
hungry, as I say, that I was on my way to the
kitchen to see what I could devour. Come along,
let's interview the pantry, and we can pack up after
I've had some food, which, by the way, dearest,
you look as if you stood mildly in need of. It's
broad daylight." She went to the window and lifted
a curtain. " Look at this ; I believe I've struck
the first sunrise which has occurred to my knowledge
since I left dear New York. This early dawn is the
explanation of England's power. She not alone lets
in daylight on her own affairs, but has enough and
to spare to see through the affairs of the whole
civilized world."

She continued chattering, and finally dragged both
Enilda and Charlotte to the dining-room, whence the
latter was sent on an exploring tour to the larder.

Flora danced around in glee, and fairly screamed

with joy when Charlotte reappeared with ample
edibles. She seized a chicken-wing. " Look at me
now, ball dress and all ; oh ! shades of

'Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred.'

Enilda, why don't you laugh ?  this is such a lark,
and what have you done to Florestan ?  he looked
like a ghost at the ball,  Avhat ? "

Then Enilda sobbed aloud, and stretched out her
hand warningly. The remembrance of that evening
passed over her : it was too bitter. She started to
tell Flora all, but broke down crying,

Oh, Flora, can't you understand ? I T like him,
and he is lost to me for ever."

CHAPTER IX.

Lucy Chromo awakened abruptly, was aghast
when informed that Enilda and Flora were on
their way that very moment to America. Enilda
showed her father's cable, and Lucy's good heart
instantly pleaded Mr. Rozen's cause. Nothing had
been said of Ida except that she was very ill, and
Enilda begged Lucy to look after her. She did
not explain what had taken place the night before
for two reasons  one her fine sense of honour, which
could not betray Ida even to such friends as Flora and
Lucy ; and the other an indescribable feeling that all
was not yet known, a vague sense of walking in the
dark, of being on the edge of a precipice where a false
step at any moment might launch her into eternity.
She was too troubled, too dazed, to fully appreciate
Charlotte Corday's zeal in begging her not to interfere
with the Count's or any one's affairs. She
never questioned the good soul, but went about
making preparations for her immediate departure, as

one goes about in a dream. Even the memory' of the
night before was intangible, and only as they were
starting off and a certain letter was placed in her
hands, did she realize all that had taken place. The
letter was from Florestan. He wrote :

I know you will believe me when I toll you that
my presence in the conservatory was one of those
purely fatal accidents which no human power has
ever yet been able to avert. I went there to dream
of you, the only woman I have ever loved. I intended
on that very night to ask you, for the last time,
to share my fate  to be my wife. How did my dream
end ? Great Heaven I was ever such an awakening
? I say no more. A vague idea had often haunted
me, the idea that perhaps you had at some time of
your life loved or cared for another; but I never
speculated upon it; I never encouraged it to come
back ; your past was as sacred to me as your present
is, as your future shall be, I still love you, but we
shall not meet again, not now, unless destiny
throws me once more in your path. I am leaving
London, I don't even know where I am going, but
you shall hear from me some time when I can command
my feelings. You ask me perhaps why I am
going ? Oh ! Enilda, can't you see that I have no
more hope ? I heard you say, ' I love another

and I am not such a fool as not to realize aU
your indifference has meant, how little you care forme,
and low really slight a place I have in your
heart. No, no, I can't h)p3 any longer, and as I
cherish sour good-will I don't want to bother you,
and shall never tell you again that I love you. Only
know that I am your friend, yours till death ; whereever
I may be you have only to call and I shall
answer. The world is not wide enough to separate
us ; I am taking myself out of your sight for a time,
because I think that you do not care even to see me.
My presence might stir up sad memories : not bitter
ones to you, dear ; you are not to blame ; you have
nothing to blame yourself with. You but followed
your inclination, and that was so like all your sex.
The crown of true womanhood is when the heart
speaks, and you  when have you ever been aught
that was not most woman ?  when shall you ever be
anything else in my eyes ? Forgive my love for you,
forgive my bluntness, my stupidity, my persistence,
my persecution. All is over now, and in the reverential
kiss I place upon the hand I once proudly
hoped to call my own, receive the assurance of my
undying regard, and believe that whatever may
happen to you and yours, myself and all I possess are
ever at your service. Farewell !

"Ythan Florestan."

They had barely arrived in Liverpool when a
telegram from Lucy Chromo announced Ida's death.
Euilda then told Flora as much as she dared, and
although her own heart was filled with trouble it
still held a tear of regret for the unfortunate young
woman  alone, betrayed, almost friendless, dead in a
foreign land, cut down in the midst of youth's priceless
hopes and priceless illusions. It seemed cruel,
even wicked, but Enilda scarcely thought of other
than her own trouble ; misfortune makes us all more
or less selfish.

The early train had come in, but just before the
sailing of the ' Arragon.' They had neither berths
nor tickets; but the purser was found, and promised
to do the best he could for them ; and
Enilda fancied there was something of pity in his
manner as he reassured her that he would do all
in his power to make her comfortable. A large
room was found at the last moment, an ex-pantry
made for cabin accommodation when the steamer
was overcrowded. The first night Flora's maid
and Charlotte Cord ay passed on the cushions of
the ladies' cabin, whilst two strangers, bound only
to Queenstown, shared the room assigned to Enilda
and Flora. They had fondly hoped that chance
would leave them to themselves ; but the next day,
when they were well out of Queenstown, this

illusion va3 promptly dispelled, as the purser showed
a lady into the cabin, briefly announcing that
she was the occupant of No. 3 berth; and half-an-hour
later the door opened and another woman
stood on the threshold. As she hesitated for some
moments, and seemed scarcely to know whether to
go or stay, Enilda civilly invited her to come in.
Lie took a step forward, saying apologetically as she
did so :

I don't know why I'm here ; I'm an intermediate ! "
Enilda looked surprised, but replied :
An intermediate ! Are you not a first-class
passenger ? "

Not a bit of it ; but the purser said I was to
come here, and here I am. I hope I'm not disturbing
of yer ? "

"I don't understand," said Enilda; 'perhaps you
do belong here. How much did you pay for your
ticket ? "

The intruder mentioned a sum about one-third
of what Enilda had paid, which left no doubt as to
the position she would occupy in the steamer; but
having been sent there by the purser, she was as
much entitled to her berth as Enilda herself.
Considering the stranger was a very portly female,
Enilda adjudged it prudent to resign the lower
bern to her, and take the upper one opposite Flora's,

besides she was nearer to the port-hole, and she
specially disliked any one over her head. Flora
was disgusted when she learned they were to be
four in a room, but Enilda was too thankful to get
home at any cost to complain of either ship-companions
or ship-quarters. She and Flora were both
deathly sea-sick, and as usual with human beings
in this state, wished for only one of two things  -
either that they would get better, or that the ship
would go to the bottom. The Intermediate happily
did not suffer from this almost universal ocean complaint,
but the fourth occupier of the state room,
after vacillating for two days between the saloon
and the ladies' cabin, finally yielded to the inevitable
and held constant possession of her berth, thus
adding to Enilda's and Flora's annoyance by preventing
the small consolation that they might have
found in talking things over confidentially.

The weather became fearful, although in the
month of July. There was incessant rain, and when
the clouds lifted they only seemed to gather themselves
together but to break again, to be followed by
violent gusts of wind and tempest. The ship rocked,
plunged fearfully forward, or again danced on the
wave with the lightness of a cockle-shell. In the
mean time Enilda and Flora became not only on
speaking, but on very friendly, terms with their room-mates,

and the Intermediate, though not sea-sick,
found herself obliged to obey orders and keep in
her cabin. No one had thought of danger, but one
could not help a certain disagreeable feeling when
told that the weather-needle marked a gale, and
the steerage were already battened down under their
hatches. As soon as the idea of danger came uppermost,
as usual all sea-sickness vanished. Flora even
got about, and as far as the saloon, when a sight met
her fjaze which sent a cold shudder all over her.
Every breakable object was shivered to atoms; the
floor and lounfes were covered with wreckae of
every sort, from a biscuit-dish to a table-rack; and
she seemed wading through piles of broken crockery
The room was almost in stitch darkness ; and added
to the terrible roar of the waves, was the dire rattle
of swinging brackets and such stationary objects as
still held fast, but which threatened every moment
to wrench themselves from their fastenings and
complete the work of general destruction. A skylight
in the elinor was broken, and the tables were
covered with a light powder of pulverized glass, every
now and then quantities of salt water poured in,
drenching everything and enveloping the room in a
cloud of spray, not unlike the steam of a vapour-bath.
Flora did not stand, but  rolled aghast. Only one
human being was in sight  a steward,  who, in Site

of a certain experience of gales, evidently Lad all
he could do to keep this balance. Suddenly there
was a terrible suction sound, as if the ship were
being irresistibly drawn into some narrow compressed
space, followed by a roar passing all description, and
a sudden darkness fell upon them.

Heavens," cried Flora, " we are lost ; what's
that ? "

The steward smiled glumly. " Only shipping a
rover, Miss," he said, and he clutched a near sideboard
as he continued his rocking.

Is it dangerous ? "

' I never saw it when it was, which means that
when it is dangerous people don't live to tell the
tales'

Flora heard no more, but with one awful shriek
turned to make her way back to the state room. Her
terror was so great that she almost walked straight,
she finally pitched headlong into her room, just
as there was another frightful suction sound ; but
again the darkness lifted, and the gallant ship leaped
forth from the caverns of the deep. Flora began
excitedly to tell all she had seen, and described
the saloon in such terms that Enilda almost laughed
at her description.

"Hear it!" she cried; "just listen to the smashing
! You see they had the tables just set for dinner ;

VOL. III. N

I don't believe there's another dish left aboard.
This last little act is what they call shipping a rover.
I suppose that's the way the ' City of Boston ' disappeared."


Flora clambered into her berth with the utmost
difficulty, chatting volubly all the while; she was as
comfortably settled as could be, when she made the
discovery that water was pouring into the stateroom,
and was already two inches deep upon the
floor. In vain she rang the bell for the stewardess ;
the water kept coming in faster and faster, until
finally the cabin trunks, the handbags and articles
of wearing apparel deposited in the corner were
positively floating about like rafts ; to add to their
consternation the same terrible suction sound was
heard again, and the same ominous blackness obscured
the room; the suspense was horrible; scarcely a
moment had passed, yet it seemed ages.

Ladies," said Flora with solemnity' we've shipped
another rover, and as we don't come out of it, I
guess this time it's dangerous. I don't want to
frighten you, but if I'm not mistaken we stand a
show of passing in our cheques this very minute."

At that moment a howl louder than the howl of
wind or wave burst from the lower berth, and the
Intermediate sprang from her bed : with the words,
I think it's time some one was a praying," she

flung herself on her knees in the middle of the
floor, her skirts flapping and splashing in the water
about her, and wildly clasping her hands above her
dishevelled hair, the darkness lifting but slightly in
the mean while, cried :

*"' Oh, father bryant, I'm praying' now for many
raisons, thanking' ye for all savers, and requesting' that
this night may turn out only as ye wish. I'm one
of twelve more or less dead and gone. I left ould
Ireland young, but I've never forgotten it, nor the
ould mither as brought me into this world of sin ;
and although I'm a poor woman and cud ill afford it,
I tuk one trip and left mee husband as is a first
liquor taylor in New York, to go to the ould
farm and save me mither from want. And, oh Lord,
lay it to my favour, take it into account that I've
settled upon the ould woman party pounds a year,
which God knows I could ill spare, and which if
I'm saved this night I'll make forty pounds more,
as sure as me name's Bridget Finery. Forty
pounds"  then the voice was lost in violent sobs,
while Flora, raising herself in her berth, screamed
out at full pitch of her voice :

Bridget, Bridget, get off your knees, turn round
and look at me this very minute. Don't you know
me ? I'm Flora Grayson ; I thought your face was
familiar, but I couldn't place it."

N 2

Mrs. Grayson's former cook  for it was none other
heard the voice, and made an effort to get up ; but
she only managed to half-raise herself, and clinging
on to the valise, turned a startled face towards Flora.
By this time the darkness was completely lifted, but
the storm raged on, accompanied by such a torrent
of words from Bridget that a stranger assisting at
the scene might easily have feared himself in Pandemonium.
The generous woman who had innocently
requested of Omnipotence that the footstep of the
Mighty Destroyer might be stayed in virtue of the
modest settlement of forty pounds which she had
bestowed on her mother's declining years, with the
addition of another forty in case she were saved, at
last managed to struggle to her feet, and with
somewhat the security of a weather-vane in a gale,
she clutched the foot of Flora's berth, and began
pouring forth the history of her life since the
Chicago fire : she went on with such joy and
exuberance that Enilda and the fourth occupant of
the cabin. Miss Walsh, nearly choked in their efforts
to subdue their laughter.

As there is only a step from the sublime to
the ridiculous, Bridget's impromptu prayer had
absolutely annulled the possible horrors of their
situation. There are some people with so keen a
sense of humour that, if the occasion presents itself,

they must laugh, even with death staring them in
the face; not alone Flora and Enilda but evidently
Miss Walsh belonged to that category, for from the
moment Bridget began her petition until the storm
abated in its violence, all thought of danger seemed
to have passed ; even Enilda's grave mental preoccupation
had to give way before the combed
chatter of three such room-mates as Flora, Bridget,
and Miss Walsh.

They had been out six days, and head winds
having stopped, considering the weather, they were
mains fairly oood time. Enilda and Flora had
both been able to get up, but Bridget steadily
declined to leave her cabin.

Miss Walsh although still ill had aired most of
her family history, as well as received sundry visits
from her aunt and uncle, whom, she informed Enilda,
occupied the bridal chamber on board the steamer.
Enilda listened to her talk without either interest
or indifference, for as they drew nearer New York
she gradually realized the difference between her
starting away two months before and her present
almost ignominious return. The excitement of the
last day in London and her enthusiastic love for
her father had almost blinded her to the real meaning
of his cable, and she began now vaguely to
wonder what his words meant  what she was coming

Lome to. Of Florestan she could not think without
commingled feelings of humiliation, pain, and love,
and when she remembered the conversation between
herself and her former lover which he had overheard,
she thought she must die for very shame. She did
not for a moment think the change in her position
would make any change in him ; even had she not
received his letter, she knew but too well the truth
and loyalty of his nature, still on this last day, as
they were nearing the shores of Staten Island, her
heart was filled with very bitter memories. She had
lost him for ever, and all through her own fault.
She could now look back upon her conduct with
that unflinching microscopic gaze, which a hopeless
present always flashes upon the past. She saw
every act, every word recorded in letters of fire, and
felt that while she had blindly followed her destiny,
at the same time her own self-love was the immediate
cause of the ruin she had sown about her.
He will despise me," she murmured ; " and I merit
it. We will probably go away from New York forever,
but some day I shall write and tell him how I
cherish his friendship and goodwill. I shall always
love him, but he shall never know it."

She was thinking all this over as she dressed
herself to go on deck for the first and last time
during the voyage; they were veering straight

r

for the horse-shoe point of water which separates
Long Island from Staten Island, and makes the port
of New York second in beauty only to Naples or
Constantinople. The sun was setting in gorgeous
points of brilliant colour which seemed to light up
every individual tree, shrub, and flower gleaming
from the banks of these water works. As Enilda
went out Flora came in, and Miss Wash said to her
briefly :

Is there land in sight ? "

Yes," said Flora cheerfully " Do you Avant a
look at your native clime ? "

No," she replied ; then there was a pause. '' Are
there any ships in sight ? "

Not many. What do you ask for ? Do you mean
to say this is your first coming home, and you don't
want to look out on the island ? "

At this juncture Bridget, who had been asleep
in her berth, suddenly awoke, and stared sleepily
out.

"No; the truth is," said Miss Walsh, "I hope
there are not many ships near, for I want to throw
all my soiled linen overboard."

What ! " said Flora, thinking she had not heard
aright.

o

Miss Walsh repeated her remark, adding : " You
see it costs so much carrying baggage around on

the Continent, and we've been travelling for five
months, over Italy, France, and Belgium, so aunt
and I got in the habit of wearing our clothes  well,
a sufficient length of time, then throwing them away
when too dirty, and buying new ones in the next
town we came to. It was the easiest and cheapest
in the end. Most people, I hear, give their ship-things
to the stewardess ; but I think I'd rather
throw mine overboard. Don't you understand ? "

"No," said Flora hotly; "I don't understand.
If that is the style of Americans you know, I hope
they'd never speak to me in Broadway, for they'd
be cut dead as sure as my name is Flora Grayson."

It was Miss Walsh's turn to stare.

Heavens and earth ! " said Bridget, rolling her
eyes and clasping her hands. "I'm only a poor
woman, and I've settled forty pounds a year on my
mother, that I can ill-afford, not to mention another
forty already promised, but I'd be ashamed to live
like that. Thank heaven, I have mee own clothes,
mee own shinimees, and mee own pocket-handkerchiefs
with mee own initials B. F. marked clear and
strong on rich corner."

Miss Walsh, like the soldier in the Light Brigade,
felt that "some one had blundered." Flora and
Bridget began their packing, utterly ignoring the
economical American. Bridget did not spare her.

She fondly overhauled the various under-garments
comprising her luggage, and gazing lovingly on the
felted B. F. in the corner, chirped oat in tones loud
enough to reach the ears of at least one Transatlantic
traveller :

I'm no millionnaire ; I've not seen Holland, or
Belgium, or Italy. I don't have bridal chambers
on steamers, and couriers traveling first-class, but
I chintz to mee own linen, and mee own initials B.
F., as fondly as the wife of a first-class New York
liquor merchant ought to do."

Night fell and the ship got in sight of New York,
but too late to go over the bar; the tired passengers
had the prospect of spending another twelve hours
on the steamer, as no one could go ashore until the
next morning. Some hours previous there had been
the usual excitement of taking the pilot aboard.
He was an extraordinary individual, wearing a tall
hat, frock-coat, spotted neck-tie, and kid gloves of
the most approved cut ; his smile was equally
fashionable, and an enormous cigar tightly wedged
between his lips seemed stuck so fast that it would
never come out.

To everybody's surprise, and to many passengers'
disgust, he could bring no news from New York,
having been out himself fifteen days, even his small
stock of newspapers and necessaries having been

washed overboard the very day of his starting. Inconsequence
those New World fanatics, who had been
obliged to give their minds and bodies ten days
absolute rest, who had been beyond the hourly persecution
of telegrams, letters, messenger-boys, telephone,
and newspapers, and to whom this enforced
repose, however beneficial after two or three days,
seemed a waste of valuable time, found themselves
oblige 1 to submit to twelve more hours of rest
before hurling themselves into the whirlpool of
agitation called life in New York.

After the latest table d'hote. Flora declared she
was sleepy, and the night being very fine Enilda
decided to take a walk with Charlotte on the
hurricane-deck. The saloon was filled with a happy
crowd of people. Whist, poker, and euchre parties
occupied every available place ; in passing the
smoking-room, men's voices in animated discussion
rang out on the night, and the combined odours of
vesuvius and delicate Havana made the air more
redolent of the billiard-room than of the sea.

Enilda stopped involuntarily; she could never
smell tobacco-smoke without seeing before her a
lawn, a fair man stretched idly on the grass, and a
hundred idle cigarette-rings circling as idly in the
summer air. What !  would she never be able to
get away from the past ?  a past which was now

mocking and loathsome. She longed to do something
desperate  to scream, to stretch out her arms,
to jump from some great height, or indulge in
some violent physical action which would burst the
band she had for the last few days felt tightening
round her heart. She longed to be alone ; even the
laboured breathing of the old negress was irritating
and painful ; so she placed her in a sheltered seat
to leeward, and began a brisk rapid march up and
down the lonely deck. She was quite alone. In
the distance she could see the Captain on the bridge,
and farther on, the shadow of the officer told off for
the watch of four bells. The night was so peaceful,
so calm, so lovely. She leaned over the taffrail,
and with hands idly clasped, looked not shore-ward,
but sea-ward. The sky was already seeded with
stars, and the mingled expanse of broad firmament
and great waste of water, seemed in the distance to
blend together in one great, one infinite realm :
beyond whose confines alone the weary mortal could
ever hope for peace. Then she looked again towards
the land, and saw the shores of two islands, whose
lights glimmering here and there seemed to stretch
forth glittering arms to clasp a semicircle of as
glittering a sea, and still farther beyond the sky
was coloured with that mysterious reflection which
streams heavenward from the myriad lights of a

great city. Eiiilda was still lost in thought when
she heard a man's measured footsteps pacing wearily
up and down. The steps drew nearer, then receded,
but continued backwards and forwards, up and down,
with the same methodical lassitude.

"Ah," she thought, "some one who like myself
longed to get away from the heat and glare and
fulsome chatter of the saloon. His step is slow,
perhaps he too has brought a breaking heart out to
commune with the stars, the silence, and the wonder
of this beautiful night." Suddenly the footsteps
paused ; she heard a smothered exclamation. In spite
of herself she turned hastily around, but recoiled
with a scream, for a man stood before her, sfazinof
at her with a look of bewildered and supreme
astonishment.

Mr. Florestan ! " she gasped. " You here ! " She
raised both her hands, and placed them before her
face, as if to shut out the shame which she felt must
cover it. He too stepped forward and placed one
hand on the railing as if to steady himself, the other
he stretched towards her.

Enilda," he said, in a voice which trembled with
emotion ; " Enilda, God knows this meeting was not
of my seeking. Can it mean, dear, that fate has
wished once more to throw us together ? Can it
mean that destiny has at last taken in her hands

those links which are to bind my Hfe to yours ?
Listen to me. I left London intending to go abroad,
when a longing came over me to see my mother, the
house where I was born, and the child who was the
means of bringing you into my life. I came aboard
at Queenstown, and induced the Captain to give
me his upper deck cabin. I have never spoken to
a soul, I have lived with the sunshine and shadow,
storm and tempest; my only companions my hopeless
thoughts of you. I said to myself, 'This is the
last niorht on board ; for the last time I shall feed
my soul with thoughts of her love. In each bright
star I shall read the brightness of a dream for ever
past ; but from this night forth, I shall put her out
of my hfe. Why has fate thrown you once more
in my path ? Why ? "

Why," she repeated ; "don't you know? Can't
you guess ? " Then she withdrew her hands from her
lace, and coming slowly towards him placed them
both on his still outstretched palms. This time it
was his turn to recoil.

Stop," he said faintly ; " I could not bear to be
deceived again ; tell me quickly what you mean ; did
I not hear you say, ' 1 love another ? ' "

She gazed straight into his eyes with a look he
had never before seen in hers.

And you did not guess !  you did not realize

when I said I loved another, who that other
was (

''Be careful, Enilda, you don't know what you are
saying."

Then she came closer to him. " Ythan, dear," she
said, in a low voice, "when I read your letter I
intended to write and tell you the truth ; all the
past, all my blindness, all my awakening ; and how
without knowing it my heart had gone out to you ;
but all is changed now;  not that I love you less,
but our positions have changed. Before I received
your letter a cable from my father told me he was
ruined  perhaps disgraced. Ruin means loss of
money. I would not insult you by supposing that
that could make any difference to you; but the
other word "  she shuddered  " disgrace ! that is
another thing."

Then for the first time since they had known each
other, Florestan spoke to her as a true man speaks
to the woman he loves.

God has been too good to me ; your sorrows are
mine, and if there be any joy, please Him we shall
share it together; if there be aught else, my name
shall protect you and yours before the world."

Early the next morning they went ashore. Flora
was so upset by the news of Enilda's reconciliation

with Florestan that she scarcely knew whether she
was on her head or on her heels. There was the
usual bustle of looking after luggage, the nuisance of
the Custom House officers, and the final landing on
the crowded wharf. Enilda in her precipitation had
entirely forgotten to warn her father of her arrival,
but a carriage was soon found, and she and Flora
with their maids and luggage were packed off to
their respective destinations. The carriage was
stopped at the last moment by Bridget, who gave
Flora her address, and begged her not to forget that
her husband sold the best Kentucky Bourbon to be
found north of Mason and Dixon's line.

Florestan was looking after the last of his luo-craore,
when he was slapped on the shoulder and confronted
by none other than Arundel  the same old Arundel,
but younger, happier, and more elegant than the
former ever imagined it possible he could appear.

My dear Florestan," he cried, almost flinging
himself into his arms, " I had no idea you were
coming ; I came here with a friend who expected
relatives to arrive by this steamer; but you don't
congratulate me,  you have not heard the news?
Why, it's victory, my friend, victory."
Florestan stared.

"What," continued Arundel; "you haven't seen
the telegrams or  the papers or heard anything ?

Stand aside, there's such a crush, I don't want people
to look at me. You see I'm a sort of hero ; my
picture has been in all the illustrated papers, even
in the * Police Gazette.' I'm a rich man now, worth
millions;  we've won. You remember the trunk,
the letters, and the papers ? Well, the trial came on
again ; Rozen came up as a witness. That last day
when I looked at him, something in his appearance,
his manner, voice  I don't know what  the man
himself,  but I had a sudden inspiration  it came
over me like a flash, and while he was crivinoj his
evidence, I stood up in the court and screamed withall
my might and main, ' That's him ; I knows him ; he
can't deceive me any more ; that's the man himself.'
Then I rushed up and denounced him then and
there. I and Perkins quietly drew forth a letter
from Rozen speaking about copper-mines, etc. The
Court compared that one with those I had, and 
the handwriting was identical. I must say he was
same. He was terribly startled at first, then he
just threw back his head, while a strange smile ran
over his face ; he put his hand to his lips, twirled his
moustache and said, more calmly than I'm talking to
you now, ' Well, and if I am, what are you going to do
about it ? ' Of course that was the end. The letters
I had, completely criminated him, and the judge
settled in my favour in less than ten minutes. Not

only was I his partner in the copper business, but
everything he had gone into from that day ice first
met and made our agreement. I was to share equally
in every affair, profit and loss, until the time I instituted
the suit against him, which was just five years
ago. Of course Rozen repudiated everything ; the
whole of the world is talking about it; even your
name is mixed up in the affair; and  the papers are
something to read. He was game, that I'll say for
him ; but think of him being the man himself all the
time ! "

"The man himself," echoed Florestan; "he  who
what do you mean ? "

He  who  what ? " mimicked Arundel, fairly
jumping around in his excitement. "Can't you
understand ? Why, it was a put-up job, the biggest
swindle ever known ; they are one and the same person,
don't you see ?  the silent partner all bosh  there
wasn't any ; Rozen was Vane and  Vane is Rozen."

What do you mean ? " Florestan stood back and
stared in helpless amazement.

"What do I mean?  and you helped me to do it.
What do you mean ?  what I've said is clear enough. '*

Go ! " said Florestan, " and never let me look
upon your face again; through you I've spent the
best years of my life to ruin the father of the one
woman in the world I love."

VOL. III. O

CHAPTER X.

Eric Rozen had played his best tramp and failed.
From that moment in the crowded court-room, when
Arundel had stripped the mask from his face, and
the mask from his life, his one idea had been
revenge; revenge not on the man he had betrayed,
but on the man who had so insulted his self-love
five years before, by giving all the money he had
won from him to the Children's Hospital in San
Francisco. He cared nothing for the loss of fortune,
nothing for the disgrace, he only faltered when he
thought of Enilda, and how he had made himself a
criminal for her sake; but even his great love and
the humiliation that unsuccessful iniquity brings
were nothing to the vengeful torrent that now overwhelmed
him. He determined to hunt his enemy
down, as he himself had been hunted down.

The meeting with Enilda had been one brief
hurried interview. When she arrived home she

found him so busily occupied in his study that he
did not even hear her open the door. When she
rushed forward and threw her arms around him, he
broke down for the first time since that awful day,
his head fell on her shoulder, and he could only
gasp :

Oh ! Enilda, I am unworthy of any honest person's
thoughts. You  of course you know all ?  you have
read the papers ? "

I know nothing but what you cabled me. I have
read no papers ; I want to read none. Nothing, dear,
can change you in my eyes ; don't fret over the loss
of money ; we were poor once and  and honest. We
must take up our lives in the old way. There is still
the cottage at Laramie  "

He sprang front her with a cry that she could
never forget.

Don't ever speak of Laramie," he said ; " it was
there I met my ruin. Laramie was destined to be
fatal to both of us. No, no, Enilda, we  we will
think of some future, but  but not yet. I can't
scheme very far ahead ; besides, there is this house
to get rid of. Most of the servants are gone ; they
were too good to stop on with a criminal."

Papa, hush ! never that word to me. I don't
know what you have done, but had you committee
murder you are still my own dLtrliug father. I shall

O 2

cling to you in the face of everything and everybody."


Then she stopped as she thought  everybody !
Everybody ? there was one  what would he say ?
She was about to tell her father all, but hesitated, as
once before in her lifetime she had hesitated. " Not
now," she thought ; " now I cannot tell him that anyone
else is in my mind, that any one else shares my
heart or hopes,"  so it was that a second time she
kept silence. She determined to send an immediate
line to Florestan, begging him to say nothing for the
present of their changed position, but was so fearful
he might call, or write to her father, that she hastily
excused herself and ran off to her room to write the
letter. Five minutes later a messenger was carrying
a note to Florestan, contain nor the folio wing :

''My Love,

I find him changed  old, sorrowful, ill.
I don't know what has happened. I have heard of
men failing before now, but did not dream that anyone
could be so affected merely by the loss of money.
Can't you understand that this is not the moment
to speak to him of our love  perhaps we may later,
when his business affairs are settled, we may then,
but not now. I have said nothing, and if you care
for me you will respect my wishes, and keep absolute

silence. Do not come and see me yet. I will write
soon. Kiss darling Cyril for me, and accept for
yourself

All my fondest thoughts,

Enilda."

When Florestan heard all that had happened,
when he realized the innocent although fatal part
he had played, he was as nearly distracted as a man
can he. He refused to see Arundel  in fact everybody.
He shut himself up to think ; to think how
he could help the man he had unconsciously betrayed.
He could not reason and say that in unmasking a
villain he had done service to the world at large,
for like the world at large, Ythan Florestan allowed
his sympathies to relegate his moral belief. As we
all refuse to recognize the shortcomings of those
whom we find personally agreeable or useful, and
find ample excuse for not only the faults the world
lends them, but the faults they really possess, so
Florestan found a million excuses for Rozen, and
looked upon him as a man who although once even
antipathetic, was no longer a malefactor, but an
unfortunate man, and above all the father of the
woman he loved.

After hours of communing, he decided to make
over the major portion of his fortune to repair the

decision of the Court, and wrote to Rozen appointing
an interview. He hoped to make Rozen accept
this money, and also to make him realize that all
he had done in the disastrous affair was not from
personal motive, but merely to help a man whom
fate had sent to his door, and who, by the most
inhuman persistence, had succeeded in interesting
him in a tale which for strangeness and intricacy
he had never before heard equalled. He knew it
would be no easy task to convince a man whom he
had almost openly insulted five years before that he
had been innocent of any wish to work against him,
but he determined at least to make the attempt.
He could not yet realize what Enilda would say
when she learned the part he had played ? Would
she not despise him, and likewise refuse to believe
that he had been an innocent worker in the affair ?

I will go away," he cried, " and not see her face
again. If she ever forgive me, if she ever send forme
to come back, but  no, that will be impossible.
In ruining him the blow has fallen heaviest on her,
as usual, on the innocent. I dare not tell Rozen
that I love her. He would see in my effort at
reparation a motive that does not exist. He would
think I offered him money to buy his daughter; and
she  God help me, she, after all, might think me
base enough to buy her at any price."

His meditations were interrupted by the arrival of
her letter. He almost screamed for joy when he
read it. Unconsciously she had left him free to
act; free for a little while to collect his thoughts
to prepare for his interview with Rozen. He
argued that if one man took him by the 'hand
another would follow, and things might not seem
so bad, time and proper influence would bridge
over a scandal at present open and gaping like a
fresh sabre-cut. As to remembering it  why, the
world moves on so fast that yesterday's horrors fade
with yesterday. No one in America has time to
think of anything but the present. To-day is dying
tomorrow not yet born. Florestan knew what
his influence could be, what his personal support
could be worth to any man in a difficult position,
and did not underrate the good he hoped to do.
If only Rozen would prove tractable !

Whilst he was turning these things over in
his mind for the hundredth time, Eric Rozen sat
alone in his study. His dark eyes were filled with
an unwonted fire, his face was stamped with a
sinister smile, and his firmly set jaw never once
relaxed its rigidity. He had written several letters,
and was writings another when Arnold brought him
a note. He read it hastily, and as Florestan had
cried aloud after learning the contents of Enilda's

letter, so her father cried aloud when he learned the
contents of this.

Fate has arranged it for me' he thought ; and
he read :

I beg you will come and meet me, as I have
something to propose to you which no one but
ourselves must hear. God knows I was innocent of
any wish to hurt you ; He made me a blind instrument
in the hands of another. I do not expect you
to believe my words, but let me prove them to you.
Meet me to-night in West Central Park, between
seven and eight, near the clump of beeches at
the open space just back of the little hill. We
cannot, must not, be seen talking at either your
house or mine. I depend upon your secrecy. I beg
you will come for  for your daughter's sake, if not
for your own. Believe me I would lay down my
life for you at any time. My grief for the role I
have played in this terrible case never can have
words. Perhaps some day you will feel that I am
your friend. I have named the hour, seven to
eifrht; at that time there's not a soul in the Park,
and we can be free to have a long talk. Don't fail
me.

Yours,

"Ythan Florentines

Kozen read, the light in his eyes deepened,
the smile on his face grew even more sinister, and
his jaw, if possible, clapped more firmly together.
I shan't fail you," he muttered ; " have no fear of
that." Then he denied himself even to Enilda, had
some slight refreshment brought to his room, and
went on with his interminable writing until the
clock struck six. After that he arose, went to another
table, and took from the drawer two pistols  seven-shooters.
These he loaded, primed, and placed in
his pocket, then he dressed himself as if for a
journey.

He went to his desk, and taking up a little picture
of Enilda as a child, looked long and earnestly at
every feature, at the luminous eyes, and smiling
mouth, at the slim hands, the quaintly-dressed hair,
and the little old-fashioned dress ; then with it still in
his hand, he went towards the wall, whence a maiden
in the first flush of womanhood smiled down upon
him. Each robes covered the lovely form ; flowers
bloomed on neck and bosom ; the hair was caught
back in a newer fashion from the fair forehead, but
the face was the same, the eyes were the same, the
expression the same  it was his own little Enilda,
who looked lovingly at him from the old picture,
whose earnest gaze followed him everywhere from
the new. He bestowed one more tender unfathomable

glance, then a sudden film came before his
vision.

Good-bye," he said tenderly ; " good-bye," and he
kissed the lips of the miniature. "I ask pardon of
this Enilda, of the little girl I held on my knee, of
the little child who used to read to me from her
primer, of the little girl who loved her father and
knew him when  he was an honest man. Goodbye,
dear, and when he is gone try and think of him
as he was then;  not  not as the world knows him
now."

Then he falteringly placed the little picture back
on his desk, gave one last look around, and prepared
to leave the chamber.

A knock came at that moment, and Charlotte
Corday's voice was heard outside.

Massa Rozen, massa Eric, may I come in ? " she
said.

He started. " Poor Charlotte I " he muttered. " Yes;
why not ?  she's a faithful creature." Then he opened
the door ; she came in and closed it quickly behind
her.

"This letter was brought, massa, a moment since,
addressed to me, shut up in another, and I was
to give it to you immediately. There's no answer."
Then she smiled on him, pushed it into his face,
and was about to retire. He called her back

as lie opened bis letter, and started as lie saw its
contents.

I might have known he'd turn up ; it comes at a
wrong moment, I've no time for him," he thought;
then he turned to the old negress with a look of
kindness on his face which even she had never seen.

'charlotte," he said, "I'm going out for a little
while ; I shan't see Enilda before I go ; I don't like to
disturb her. I  I've been thinking of you to-day.
You've served me and mine long and faithfully, and
I want you to promise if anything ever happens, you
you will never desert her while life lasts."

"Oh, Massa Rozen, what do you mean? What's
going to happen ? You ain't nothing' like your ole self.
I'll call her now."

No, no," he interrupted, " I'm all right, I only
need a little air. I'm going for a walk."

But you'll be in for dinner, massa ? "

Dinner ! "  he smiled strangely. " Oh yes, I'll be
in then, or at any rate before it's over, that's all.
Good-bye ;  I mean, you may go."

Charlotte could only obey. She withdrew silently,
but with a presentiment of evil, went to her room
and dressed herself, descended and prepared to follow
her master as soon as he should leave the house.
She did not need to read the newspapers or to be
told that some calamity had overtaken the house, for

since that night when she had been an unwilling
listener in her master's apartment, she had lived in
daily, hourly expectancy of a storm which should
burst and engulf them all in ruin.

Rozen read his letter, which was a single sheet
of paper wrapped round the half of a blank visiting-card
torn irregularly in the middle. On the paper
was written :

I must see j'ou at once. As you come out of
your house a man will walk up to you carelessly,
will not recognize you, but v/ill give you the corresponding
half of the enclosed card. Follow him ; I
shall arrive at the rendezvous as near as possible
at a quarter to seven; don't fail me. The man
after indicating to you the place of meeting wall
leave you. And as soon as he is out of sight I will
appear."

Rozen with an oath crushed the letter in his hand.

What ! he has been my ruin body and soul, and
hasn't done with me yet ! The worst is known, and as
to other transactions he doesn't know it, but he's out
of them altogether." Then he held the bit of pasteboard
disdainfully up in his fingers. " His old trick,
his old signal,  well ! so be it. I'll see him to-night,
but I'll send him off in short order, and if he wants
another meeting, I'm not sure that it wouldn't be as

well to give it to him after I have seen Mr. Florestan.
Why not ? " He put the letter in one pocket and the
bit of pasteboard in his watch-pocket, and this time
prepared to go out, but he went back again to take
Florestan's letter, which he had left on his desk.

When he reached the door he stopped yet again
on the threshold.

"Good-bye," he said softly, looking at the little
picture. "When I am gone the world will soon
forget what a villain your father was."

He closed the door and in another moment was
in the street; he did not see a dark shadow
which kept him closely in view and followed him
stealthily step by step, and had reached the corner
of the street farthest from his house when a man
brushed by him, held something up between his
fingers, then passed on before him. Kozen nodded
involuntarily, seized the bit of torn card and followed
him. The man, after many circuitous windings in
and out, to Rozen's surprise led the way into Seventh
Avenue ; he scarcely noticed his conductor was taking
the road to the Park, but followed him mechanically.
He was filled with such dark, desperate, and reckless
thoughts that he scarcely realized what he was benton
doing. He was a godless man, and had little fear
of death; and yet he could not think without a
shudder that perhaps this was his last night on

earth; he vaguely remembered the time, not long
since  when he was honest; perhaps more honest
than many another; but now he was tired of life,
of these five long years of deceit, lying, and villainy.
He loved his daughter so well that he had committed
crime for her sake. He said to himself,
** What is this old man's money ? He's a drivelling
fool ; he'll be in his grave shortly, and no one will
ever be the wiser. Many a man has done worse
than I, and has never been found out. What are
the successful men of to-day  if you look into their
intimate records  other than thieves, liars, and
swindlers ? Every railway stock, every mining stock,
every new bubble blown on the market, is inflated
with the cries of widows and orphans, of starving
men, women, and children. The crime to-day is not
the being a villain  but in being found out."

Then he quickened his pace, but stopped suddenly,
for his guide indicated a rustic bench half hidden
between low branching trees, and a mask of shrubbery
as wild and uncultivated as any virgin forest
in the heart of the Great West.

Rozen sank into the seat and smiled bitterly ashe
reflected that at that very moment, perhaps nota
hundred yards away, fashionable New York was
driving up and down the . stately avenues of her
beautiful promenade; for Central Park is as distinctly

American in its civilization as any of tLe
New World's cities, betraying on one hand a perfected
cultivation which would not disgrace the
famous Bois de Bologna, and on the other a savage
luxuriance of primitive uncouthness. Not a person
Alas in sight, and the only sounds heard were the
falling of some leaflet, and the rustling of a gentle
breeze through the dense foliage ; the incessant call
of birds* voices, with the occasional refrain of a
mocking-bird, who had brought its notes and song
from some magnolia vale of the distant South. The
air was perfumed with the indescribable fragrance
of ripe summer, but the softness of the scene had
little effect on Rozen's remorseless mood. He started
once as he heard a carriage roll by evidently very
near; he suddenly recollected that the 'jeunesse
stage-donee" of New York were in the habit of
driving out to dine at High Bridge, a chalet
restaurant on the Hudson some distance beyond the
Park, and to various similar places of resort dotted
here and there about the environs of Gotham. He
knew he was safe from observation ; and was calculating
on the improbability of being disturbed by
any one coming that way without a purpose, when
he heard a hasty footstep and the Count stood before
Lin.

Ah well, here you are," he said with a smile.

"Thanks for being prompt." He held out his
hand.

Rozen got up and his face wore a very black look ;
he drew back as he saw the Count's outstretched
palm.

Never again," said he. " I may be fallen very
low, but I'm too good ever to touch the hand of such
a blackguard as you are ; and you may as well know
first as last that I've done with you for ever. Be
brief  my time is short. What do you want with
me?"

Ah ! not shake hands with me ? As you will.
That's scarcely a welcome to a pal who has come
straight from the steamer, and hasn't even had time
to change his travelling-suit. This is one of your
high saluting' ' days, Rozen. I hope you don't object
to my smoking ? I'm dying for a cigar."

Say what you have to say, and be brief. You
have no more claim on me ; and now that everything
is over, what more can you expect from me ?
I didn't think it even worth while to mention your
collaboration, your name at the trial."

"There was good enough reason for that," interrupted
the Count. " What was the use of dragging
in a person who has been so useful to you in the
past, and who, if not necessary to you in the present,
certainly will be so in the immediate future ? "

Rozen laughed scornfully. "You are only right
in one thing: there is no past, no future for me;
the present is now, and I don't need you."

'' What were your reasons then for not speaking
of me at the trial ? "

"Very simple. I considered you beneath my
notice. My own position was bad enough ; there'll
be enough obloquy attached to my name, and I
didn't care when you are found out  as you will
be sooner or later  to have hed the honour of a long
acquaintance with you, added to the number of my
crime?  "

Take care," interrupted the Count. " Don't try
me too far." Then he blew some rings of smoke into
the air, and with his slender bamboo cane began
writing the initials of his name in the gravel at his
feet. " Don't talk nonsense ! " he went on. "What's
a failure ? What's this infernal law-suit any way ?
the fat's in the fire now, but I've thought of a plan
by which you can not only recoup yourself and get
even with everybody, but revenge yourself on two
persons, one that hound Florestan  "

"Ah!" gasped Rozen, suddenly remembering his
appointment to meet the latter. It was drawing
near the hour. "I've no time to hear any of your
plans," he said brutally. "If you wish a future
partner, that partner will not be me. You certainly

VOL. III. P

ought to be thankful enough to get off free yourself
not to bear me any ill-will for thus abruptly terminating
our heretofore close relationship. You must
have money enough by this time to keep you from
want, and you certainly have ingenuity enough if not
to suggest new and lucrative fields of adventure, at
least to return to your old livelihood, surely. Black
Bill"

The Count dug his cane more deeply into the
gravel, destroying the symmetry of his name which
he was writing in elegant scrip, then he jumped upas
suddenly.

Don't push me too far, Rozen, and don't speak
that name here. You are not in a mood for joking ?
Well, neither am I. You want me to be brief; you
ask me what I want. Well, I'll tell you; I want
two hundred thousand dollars, and I want it to-night,
and you  you're going to give it to me."

He did not even wait for an answer to his words,
but for the first time during the interview began
pacing up and down, and switching his stick right
and left at the trees and shrubs bordering the path.
He was so excited and Rozen so pre-occupied that
neither heard a hurried whispering and half-indistinct
rumour of footsteps evidently in their immediate
vicinity.

Rozen laughed a short hard laugh and also got

up. He mechanically shook down and settled this
trousers as a man always does after having been
seated for five minutes or fifty ; then he spoke hotly,
harshly, soothingly, and to the point.

What do you take me for ? Two hundred thousand
dollars !  why, I wouldn't give you two hundred
thousand cents to save you from hell. Henceforth
you go your way and I go mine ; besides, you've no
right to ask me for money ; I've more than fulfilled
my contract with you. Where would I get such a
sum to give you ?  you forget you're speaking to a
ruined man."

"But those other transactions  the bonds, the
mortgages on the new Leadville mines, the shares
in that Pittsburgh coal company, all started this last
year, they are worth  "

"The paper they are printed on  nothing more;
and if they were you have nothing to do with them.
Know for the last time, that if I had fifty millions
I'd see you dead at my feet, I'd see you rotting
before I'd give you a cent."

The Count stopped his restless walk and adopted
another tone; this time his was the humble pleading
voice.

"You are not right!" he said. "Were we not
partners in everything? Was not I the sole and
unique means of your making such a fortune ? Didn't

P 2

I suggest to you months ago what was coming; and
even offer to get that devil Florestan out of your
road ? You helped me at a desperate time, and
I come now to help you to suggest a plan ; but not
until you've helped me first, and you must help me
because I'm in danger; that fiend Ricard and a
woman you know a little about have determined
to ruin me. You'll say, ' What's that to me ? *
Nothing ; except that if I'm done for I can't be of
any more help to you. You can't get two hundred
thousand ?  well, one hundred thousand then ;  that
I must have or, by G  d ! "  and he stepped threateningly
in front of Rozen  " I'll know the reason
why."

Stand aside ! " said Rozen hoarsely. " I want topick
no quarrel with you ;  you forget I'm a beggar
a disgraced and ruined man ; you at least are free.
Stand aside and let me pass. I wish you no harm ;
you've been the bane of my life, but we meet tonight
for the last time. "Will you let me pass ? I
have other work on hand : we are quits."

Are those your final words ? "

Yes !  No ! I say once more, hope for no money
from me  "

But the words died in his throat, for the Count
sprang at him, seized both wrists in a vice, and
before he could even cry for help whipped out a

bowie-knife and planted it to the Lilt in dozen's
body. The latter gave one scream, and divining the
Count's movement, the instant his hand was free,
seized one of his pistols and fired blindly at the
murderer.

At that instant the bushes parted back of them,
and Fiorestan and Charlotte Cor day, with loud
cries for help, rushed into the pathway ; the former
pinioned the Count's arms from behind, and threw
him violently to the ground. Meanwhile the victim,
half-leaning against the bench, with a steady hand
withdrew the knife from his wound, but at the same
moment with a faint cry sank to earth.

Charlotte  Enilda ! " he gasped ; '' this is my
death-blow."

In an instant the path was filled with men,
attracted by the noise of the shot and cries for help.
A policeman dashed through the covert, but before
the Count's illustrious person could be secured other
officers arrived upon the scene, and Fiorestan was
soon relieved of his painful position.

The next thought was for the victim. His head
was on Charlotte's bosom. The ground was dabbled,
a pool lay beside the bench, and Charlotte's hand
and handkerchief, with which she had vainly attempted
to staunch the wound, were reeking with
blood. The officers explained to Charlotte that

Rozen must be carried to the nearest house, and
a shutter fetched from a neighbouring; chalet was
already at hand, whilst a messenger despatched by
Florestan's thoughtfulness had already rushed off for
Enilda.

The Count, as soon as he saw himself surrounded,
protested his innocence, and declared he had only
assaulted Rozen in self-defence. His protestations,
however, elicited no response beyond a dangerous
look from Florestan, and a lowering glare from
Charlotte Corday.

Gentlemen," said the Count to his captors, " pray
let me give you my name, and you will see that
I am a gentleman, and you have no need to detain
me by force. I shall be very pleased to give myself
into your custody, and see the end of this very
painful affair. You forget Mr. Rozen was one of
my most cherished friends. I cannot doubt that
his attack on me was a sort of temporary madness,
and I, alas ! like my esteemed friend Louis  I beg
your pardon, the late Emperor Louis Napoleon  by
no fault of mine I find myself a prisoner."

In spite of the nobleman's remarks and self-assertions
of innocence he was regarded with no special
leniency by his guard. These gentlemen, like most
of the New York police, being mostly Irishmen, two-thirds
Fenians, and the other third Nationalists or

Radicals, had no respect for titles, none whatever
for gentlemen, and very little for individuals of any
class. As they reached the chalet where Rozen, still
unconscious, was laid on a bed, the Count looked
back for the last time, waved his hand in touching
farewell, and as he was walked away, said :

' Alas ! my poor friend, who would ever have
believed that he could have turned upon me as he
did ? I who have been such a friend, as soon expect
a doo in a fit of indiscretion to bite his master. God
knows, it were almost better to have him murder
me than to have retaliated even by a blow directed
at my best friend."

Charlotte and two officers took their place beside
Rozen. Happily a doctor, a resident physician, was
at that very moment found who succeeded in bringing
him back to consciousness. He took Florestan
aside and told him, after examination of the wound,
that the blow was fatal, and that at best Rozen had
but a few hours to live.

He is a powerful man," he continued ; " otherwise
death would have been instantaneous. I'm going
to give him a stimulant, and if he has any earthly
affairs to settle they must be attended to to-night,
and as soon as possible, for his time is very short."

Florestan then explained the name, position,
and estate of the injured man; said that his only

daughter had been sent for, and as their house
almost adjoined the Park she might be expected
at any moment; then as the victim showed signs
of returning life the doctor hastened towards him.

Eric Rozen opened his eyes.

Mr. Dozens' said the physician, with grave courtesy,
"I am deeply grieved, but it is my duty to
inform you that you have received a fatal blow.
Are you prepared for death ? "

Rozen stared strangely at him. The, doctor then
told him that whatever statement he made would
be regarded as an oath, and after several moments
had passed Rozen realized the purport of these words,
and raising his hand gave solemn utterance to the
formula.

Knowing and believing that I am a dyeing man,
I solemnly swear all I say is the truth  the solemn
truth." Then he sunk back seemingly overcome,
and silence reigned whilst the doctor administered
a second stimulation draught.

Where is he ? " said Rozen, half-opening his eyes
and speaking in a faint voice. " Ah ! he has done
for me at last. I call upon all to witness that I
didn't wish to harm him. I begged him to leave
me; he was levying black mail I could no longer
submit to, and he has murdered me. A Count
indeed ; he may be a Count for all I know, but I

know him better as the thief, forger, and criminal,
Black Bill, I was weak enough to help to assist
to escape from the jail of Chicago when the city was
burnt five years ago."

Florestan started with horror.

Black Bill ! " he exclaimed. " Impossible 1 "

At the sound of that voice Rozen attempted to
open his eyes. " Who's there ? " he asked hoarsely.
Is that Ythan Florestan' s voice ? "

"Yes, yes," said the latter, pressing forward
eagerly. " My poor friend, can I do anything for
you ? At least you shall be avenged, for not alone
I, but Charlotte Corday is a witness ; we overheard
all your conversation, and saw that villain strike the
blow."

You ! " he murmured,  " you ! Fate is indeed
strange,  you a friend. Oh no !  but Charlotte
Corday and Enilda ! Where is Enilda ? "

Oh massa, hare I am," cried Charlotte, throwing
herself on her knees ; " and Miss 'Nilda's a coming.
Dat limb o' Satan has struck you; but please God
you'll get right again soon."

No, no, Charlotte, I shall never be better in this
world, and before I leave it I only want to see 'Nilda
and tell her all the truth."

Mr. Rozen," said the doctor solemnly, " we must
be prepared for the worst ; your earthly affairs  "

Are all in onler. I am going out of the world
not exactly as I intended, for I came to this Park to
meet a man who has been my enemy for long years ;
he had nothing against me, and yet he has succeeded
in ruining: and dissfracinor me and mine. You think
I've got a settler, doctor; well, it's as easy dying
with a clear conscience as a cloudy one, so I'll make
a clean breast of it. I wanted to be revenged on the
man who ruined me. I came here to do for Ythan
Florestan what another has done for me, and then
make away with myself  end a life that he has
rendered no longer bearable to me."

"Impossible," gasped Florestan, starting back in
horror. " I pray you, gentlemen, take no heed of
what he says ; his mind wanders."

No, no," murmured Rozen faintly ; " it won't do.
I know exactly what I'm saying, and  what's
that ? "

His quick ear had caught a footstep on the gravel
outside; and before he could says another word
Enilda burst into the room and flew to her father's
side. His face lit up with a radiance which might
have beamed from the face of a seraph. At this
juncture the doctor insisted on his swallowing a
stimulant. He seemed to revive after that, partially
raised his head, and lifted his arm, which he tried
to place round Enilda's neck ; his eyes seemed still

covered bj the same film, but his voice was a little
stronger.

Eailda," he said ; " don't cry, child ; we all have to
go some time, and it's better for you that my time
has come now."

Oh papa, don't say that  don't say that 1 "

He closed his eyes and went on, meanwhile
threading his fingers softly through her hair as he
had been wont to do when she Alas a little girl,
and used to sit upon his knee.

"I know I'm going to shock you, and break you
all up by what I'm going to say, but I can't go
before I've told you the truth ; I can't face your
mother  for I hope I'm going to meet her  with
one lie left on my soul. After she died I went to
the bad, but you never knew it. It was out of my
love for you. I tried honest means; they didn't
work ; then dishonest. I wanted to make a fortune
for you, Enilda, so you should hold up your head with
any lady in the land. You know you're nobody in
America unless you've got money. It don't make
much difference how you get it, and I was only
worse than other men because I got found out.
I met Black Bill at Laramie ; he called himself a
Baron; and we had only struck up a sort of a
partnership when I found out who he was in
Chicago. Then it was too late to back out. I helped

to free him the night of the fire. He ha-j named me
Vane long before : it was easier having two names ;
it was his idea about doing Arundel ; it was  "

His voice faltered and his head fell on his breast.

Enilda," he murmured ; " where are you ? "

Here, papa ;  oh, don't tell me any more  what
can it matter now !  you are so ill, don't think
of it."

Where was I ? " he said, half raising his head.
Oh yes ; we played euchre in the train, and
Florestan  has always been my enemy."

For the first time Eiiilda seemed to become aware
of the latter's presence. Without a word she
motioned him to her side.

Papa," she said softly, " there's something I want
to tell you ; Mr. Florestan  "

Oh, sir," cried Florestan, springing forward,
pray forgive me the great wrong I have unintentionally
done you. I am your friend, I swear it.
I love your daughter  do you hear me ?  my one
wish on earth is to make her my wife ;  forgive  "

"Forgive  forgive," murmured the dying man;
yes  all  Enilda, are you there ? It's growing
dark, oh, so dark  I'm cold  what's that?  the
forest  the Indians,  they could not kill you, my
beloved  stand back, she's there, waiting  I hear the
brook, and the bird  that mocking bird that used to

sing. We are poor, 'Nilda; but you say we'll be
honest, and when we have each other;  ah  
ah"

His head fell backwards, and Eric Rozen's soul
passed into the dark valley.

They lifted him and bore him through the Park,
now wrapped in the tenderest hues of that fair but
dying summer day. Love-birds chanted to their
mates, crystal waters cooed and sang in soundless
basins, perfumed breezes sighed through arching
trees, and as they neared the main avenue faint
murmurs of the distant city were borne towards
them on the soft night air. The cortege was stopped
but once.

A gaudy break loaded with a party of pleasures
on their way to High Bridge dashed into the
path, but so intent where they on their evening's
prospective amusement, that not one look was
bestowed upon the silent group drawn up by the
roadside.

"You think so," screamed the voice of a celebrated
operatic courtesan. 'not if I know it; I
bet before the day is ended I too will hold a
diamond  "

Hush ! " cried a companion peremptorily, who
at that moment had caught a glimpse of the shutter
with its veiled and silent burden. "Hush," he

continued more softly ; " can't you see that is the
body of a dead man ? "

As the break whirled by voices were stilled and
hats reverently lifted. Thus Eric Rozen was saluted
for the last time, by any members of the New York
Stock Exchange.

CHAPTER XI.

The civilized world was ringing with the Rosen
scandal ; even the London press was filled with
leaders and articles touching upon America, Americans,
and American society women in general. The
illustrated papers contained portraits of the Copper
Queen and her father; society was informed that
the lessons to be learnt from this extraordinary lawsuit
were not few ; that it was time Americans were
received with more reserve; that money, beauty,
and even brains were not enough, etc., etc.

Whilst the American newspapers from Maine to
California and Minnesota to Mexico teemed with
stories of the Copper Queen, her introduction to
New York life, her family, her father, her position,
herself, one daily had devoted columns to their
peculiar position and the terrible deception practised
upon, not alone all their friends, but upon one in
particular: a nobleman of such birth and position

as the Count de Marcie and D'Orbach, "who, it
was feared, would gain the lamentable impression
that every luxuriant banquet in New York spread
in his honour, was presided over by swindlers, gamblers,
and diddlers in general." But the climax of
excitement was reached when Gotham, which had
not recovered the shock of the scandal, learned
that Rozen was a dead man, murdered, and by none
other than the above-named gentleman. When she
realized that her beloved guest, her distinguished
model in all that was elegant, exact, and irreproachable
was an assassin, excitement knew no bounds,
and the city seemed absolutely one voice talking
over a murderer and his victim.

Pending the Count's indictment before the grand
jury, for a month he was held in durance vile, namely,
a series of perfumed, richly-furnished chambers in
the Tombs, with attendance, food, and comforts
hitherto unknown to him in America. The city was
divided against itself into partisans or non-partisans,
for while America would believe any iniquity preferred
against an American, it was most cautious in
entertaining opinions derogatory to a titled foreigner,
whose name and presence alone for two seasons had
given the city such new social impetus : whose mind
had directed Congress and commerce, whose taste
had pointed out dishes welcome to even a Lucullus's

palate, whose waltzing was perfection, whose insolence
was delicious, whose clothes were perfection,
and whose manner upon every occasion breathed the
quintessence of an Old World refinement which even
the most ancient of American towns could in vain
attempt to imitate.

August passed, and part of September; Newport,
Long Branch, Saratoga, and Swampscott had one
theme  the Eric-rosen scandal; one refrain  the
Rozen murder, and the noble assassin. Count de
Marcie and D'Orbach.

In the mean time Enilda lived with Flora, and
was personally ignored by the city, which but three
months before had yielded her that homage the
world always yields to the favoured of nature and
fortune ; but like the world, dien Fortune had
withdrawn her smiles, the innocent victim to popular
caprice became the criminal. Those who had
basked in the sunshine of her society, who had drank
her father's wine and partaken of his hospitality
were the first to denounce both him and her ; those
who had danced at her balls and ridiculed the rest
of mankind now danced in other circles and ridiculed
her. Only a few old friends remained true 
the Chromic, the Graysons, the Professor, and Miss
Chances-Cressy ; and last but not least, Florestan ;
Florestan, who since the night of the murder had

VOL III. Q

been her shadow, her very second self, but who had
never urged his love upon her. He had only said
once after the funeral :

Enilda, I am always yours. I ask nothing now.
Look upon me as your friend only. When your
father's death is avenged, then I shall come to you."

He had longed to protect her with his name, but
common sense clearly pointed out to him that however
much Enilda might love him, then was not
the moment to take advantage of her helplessness.
It was perfectly understood at Dr. Grayson's, however,
that he was her accepted lover, and some day they
would be married.

Mrs. Chromo had returned from Europe and
brought scant news of Ida's death. The world looked
upon a broken blood-vessel as the apparent cause,
but Enilda and her world knew the real reason to
be a broken heart. A slight paragraph in a leading
theatrical journal was consecrated to her obituary ;
it was read in the morning, ignored at noon, and
forgotten by night. Lucy Chromo's stock of gossip
also comprised the news that John Claremont had
gone for a year on a yachting tour in the Mediterranean,
and that Baron d'Alfredi was much chagrined
at Flora's abrupt departure. She Herself, however,
was ill and out of sorts. Her affairs were still in
the same state ; with the exception that she had Lad

various interviews with her counsel, Lawyer Harkins,
her application for. divorce had been published,
commented upon, and formed , a happy pendant
to the forthcoming murder trial. Harkins had
explained to Mrs. Chromo that her case being a
delicate one, the witnesses being the same as those
subpoenaed f(jr the great affair, she must absolutely
keep her own counsel, confide in and talk with no
one before she appeared personally in court. The
first hearing of Chromo versus Chromo was set down
for the first divorce suit at the opening of the
autumn sessions, but as Lucy saw the time approach
she began to wish more and more that she had not
pushed matters to a crisis.

New York was in a fair way to have plenty to
talk about; and on the first day of September, in
the court of Oyer and Terminer, Fritz de Marcie,
known as the Count de Marcie and d'Orbach, was
brought up to be tried for the murder of his friend,
the late Copper King, Eric Yane Rozen.

Business of the day was given over to attend the
trial. Female Gotham had ordered new bonnets and
frocks, male Gotham the latest thing in beavers and
neckties. Wall Street was even forgotten ; Pacific
Mail hadn't budget for days, and the best of preferred
stock slumbered on its units as a tired child slumbers
on its mother's bosom. The only topic was the

Q 2

murder, the only person talked of de Marcie. Dinners
were commanded at clubs, and luncheons at down-town
restaurants. Parties were made up to attend
at the Criminal Court as they are made up for
Henley or Buckingham : the Attorney-general foreseeing
the crush to fiet into the court-room had
issued personal invitations for the ceremonies, without
which invitation no outsider could be admitted
these cards, in pasteboard of ominous red, were
printed in black, with ''' De Marcie Trial " in capitals
at the head, and the name of the guest, Mr. or Mrs.
so-and-so, Written in elegant scrip in the corner, with
the centre-line in blank, to be filled in, like the
usual invitation to a ball or dinner.

New York had talked itself hoarse over the Yane-
Kozen scandal ; the new millionnaire Arundel was
the hero in financial circles, the well-known millionnaire
Florestan the hero in social ones, but the
attempted murder of the defendant by Gotham's
pride, in the way of excitement, had actually paralyzed
the cosmopolitan community : although having
survived centuries of surprises, having been suitably
stirred by one horse-scandals, and moderately moved
by esclandres on a grander scale, America still yielded
the palm to this latest event as the most interesting
affair which had been known in the States since
George Washington interviewed that cherry tree, or

Wilkes Booth immortalized a family of hitherto only
passable comedians, by his Good Friday impromptu
in Ford's old Baltimore theatre.

There was as much sass, jealousy, scheming, and
rankling to get tickets for that trial as there is to
procure invitations to a State Concert in Buckingham
Palace or a ball at Marlborough House. Although
marked " personal," these happy bits of crimson card
were begged, borrowed, and stolen ; were sold at the
court-house door from two dollars a single admission
and upwards, were advertised in the daily papers as
Mitchell advertises his opera-boxes; and one enterprising
firm in Broadway had opened a successor
near the court-house where everything was furnished
at a moderate price, from an invitation to a bouquet
for the murderer, from opera-glasses down to fans
and salts, from photographs of the victim and assassin,
to autographs and complete biographies of
all parties concerned in the case. There was even a
short biographical sketch and profile of the jury,
and an hourly bulletin was issued with accounts of
the noble murderer's well-being.

It was a lovely days in September. The air without
was balmy, anl bad a suspicion of salt in it, like
the air that blows over Sussex from the South
Downs. The great court-house was filled with one
of the most fashionable and distinguished audiences

Which had ever assembled at any criminal trial in
Gotham. The windows were thrown open, a fine
series of golden rays filled the room with sunshine,
and birds' voices floated in happy trills through the
airy casements ; within were the commingled odours
of mignonette, lily of the valley, and gardening, while
at one time the atmosphere seemed one sole breath
of Gotham's pet Jacqueminot, which lay in great
crimson heaps on the murderer's table.

The judge sat cheery and smiling behind his
judicial table. He wore a suit of new and stylish
plaid in happy checks ; his hair was loaded, curled,
and jaunty, his moustache had a Victor Emanuelian
cut ; and his cat's-eye studs, like his watch, were
new for the occasion; an orchid loomed in his
button-hole, his boots were of patent leather, and to
the right of his shapely feet an enamelled spittoon
reposed in insolent although customary splendour.

The jury in their box looked like a party of
gentlemen sitting on a race. They kept up a lively
hum of conversation between themselves, whilst
every now and then one nodded in friendly license
to some acquaintance in the audience, another made
notes on his shirt-cuff, or another sent hasty signals
to some crowing child : evidently his tender offspring,
come to take lessons in the science of murder
and American jurisprudence. The Attorney-general

and prosecuting lawyers sat at a square polished
table, the former idly cutting quills, the latter engaged
in conversation with Flora, vho looked her
brightest and prettiest. In a seat beside her sat
Enilda, closely veiled ; to her right at some little
distance sat Mr. Florestan, while here and therein
close proximity were Prof. Protoplasm, Miss
Chances-Cressy, and Mr. Pastor, naturally arrived
from London, with Adam Chromo and others more
or less interested in the case. Alone Lucy Chromo
Lad not appeared at the trial. She was fretting
about her own divorce suit, and waiting at home
until she should be notified to appear in that case,
of whose judiciousness at the present moment she
began to entertain various and perplexing opinions.
She was racked between her love for Euilda and
regard fur the Count, whose innocence, however, she
doubted not, would sooner or later be established.

The judge was seen to yawn, the jury to consult
together, the Attorney-general to take up a
morning paper. There was a rustle of silks and a
confused hum of voices in the outer hall; those voices
grew louder and louder, and finally there was a
general cry of " Here he comes ; here's the prisoner ! "

The doors were thrown open and the assassin
appeared, walking blandly and upright between
two officers, followed by a crowd of pretty women

-who tried frantically to touch the lice of his garments,
or to kiss his fat white hand. Those ladies
would individually have given a year of their lives
to have had his autograph, and have gone without
ice-cream a whole summer to have received from his
noble lips one smile or word which could he treasured
up in memory's immemorial store-house. There
were dozens of youths who followed in the train,
with eye-glass and the latest cut of dittos, with early
winter flowers in their button-holes, and pearl kids
whose wilderness would have shamed even a Beau
Crammed's. But all this passed for naught; the
only one " who held the house " was the star of the
occasion, the m )st noble Count de Marcie and
d'Orbach who still walked with firm tread, until he
neared a table on the rioht, identical with that of
the prosecution.

As the Saxon law permits criminals to defend
themselves, the Count, being a gentleman of average
intelligence, was not slow to avail himself of this
privilege. There was something so courtly in his
gait and manner as he strode down the narrow aisle
which separated the Attorney-general from the
judge and reporters, that a murmur of admiration
rose from the crowd : this he acknowledged by
frequent bows and bland smiles, as Royalties b )W
from their carriage in the Park, or the Hippodrome

stars in their Roman chariots bow to the public at
the Paris circus. He first saluted his honour most
civilly, and his ho :our returned the courtesy in an
equally civil fashion ; for it had no more been proved
that the prisoner at the bar was a murderer than
that he was a Count. He also bowed gravely to the
jury and the prosecuting attorney, receiving anon
civil salutations, anon half-dazed stares, from the
general assembly. He smiled as he passed Flora, and
said cheerily :

How do you do, Miss Grayson ? "  and to another
old friend  "Ah, Stuart, glad to see you; lovely
day, isn't it ? Family well ?  that's right !  all here
naturally. I am glad to see my friends in force
on such a memorable occasion." Then he placed
his hand on his heart with an air which would not
have disgraced Versailles, and turned towards Miss
Chances-Cressy, saying : " Thanks, dear friend, for
your touching little note. Ah ! so soon as this unpleasant
little affair is over, we will re-live the i3a?t
in an old-fashioned chat in Mrs. Chrome's porcelain
gallery."

A few more nods and gentle salutations final-y
brought him to a table which was heaped with
bouquets, love-letters, letters of sympathy, letters
requesting his autograph, and letters from theatrical
managers bef]C2:inor the first refusal of a stirrings tour

over America just as soon as the little affair should
be satisfactorily terminated.

The attendance being complete, the crier got up
with the usual formula  '' Oyez, oyez. Hear ye, all
38 persons who have business in this court now
opening  draw near and ye shall be heard."

The court was then declared open, and the clerk
of the court called the case. The prosecuting
attorney began his case with the usual formula:

"Mr. Foreman and gentleman of the jury, weare
here to inquire into the manner in which the
deceased, Eric Rozen, met his death ; and I expect
to prove to you that the said deceased was foully
murdered on the night of August 5th, in the west
side of Central Park by the prisoner at the bar,
Fritz de Marcie ; known as the Count de Marcie
and d'Orbach."

The District Attorney then marshalled his facts
and presented the case to the jury in language of
unusual eloquence, then read the deceased's dying
declaration, which caused the greatest sensation in
the court. The prisoner at the bar, who sat at his
flower-bedecked table, retained at first a passive demeanour
; but he turned very pale when the prosecution
read the statement regarding the late trial, and
that the Count was none other than the notorious
criminal " Black Bill." The audience broke into

threatening demonstrations towards the prisoner, who
glanced warily around for a moment, then burst into
such a series of ironical shrieks that the court-room
became a scene of wild confusion : the hearing of the
case was almost impossible. Order finally restored,
the District Attorney concluded by an offer of
evidence direct  eye-witnesses, not alone of the
murder, but witnesses who had overheard a conversation
held between the deceased and the prisoner
at the bar, the which conversation absolutely nullified
prisoner's pretence of justification, self-defence, etc.
The first witness was then called.

Ythan Florestan took his place in the box, and
after the usual formula began to give his testimony.
He related all that had transpired already known,
but when he came to the question of going to the
Park, he was interrupted by the prisoner :

Prisoner.  " Mr. Florestan, you know you have
always hated my late cherished friend ; you asked
him to meet you in the Park,  can you tell why ? "

Florestan flushed.

Must I answer that ? " he asked.

The judge ruled that the question was one which
required an answer. Florestan began to explain,
when be stopped again.

The Count smiled.

*'My good fellow," he said, "you asked him to

meet you in the Park for one purpose ;  ycai hated
him, you hated me, and you longed to get him out
of the country. When a man is in love with another
man's daughter  "

Cries of " Shame, shame," re-echoed throughout
the court-room. " Silence, silence ! " screamed the
crier. Then the Count continued :

"Well, we'll drop that. What did you want to
meet him for ? "

Florestan looked around helplessly for a moment ;
then lifting his head haughtily spoke :

I know what I am going to say."

Never mind what you are going to say," interrupted
the prisoner; "damn it, say what you
did."

Witness.  " I wrote, making an appointment with
the deceased to meet me in West Central Park, as
I intended offering  "

Prisoner.  " Never mind what you intended ; what
did you do ? "

The court interposed. The prisoner's interruptions
made any statement impossible. The judge gave
a ruling that the witness's intentions must be
accepted as evidence, as they explained the reason
of h's having made an appointment with deceased.
After that Florestan continued, and not without a
certain embarrassment managed to say why he had

written to Rozen. As he finished, the Count arose
with a laugh.

"Gentlemen of the jury," he said, "I am franker
even than the witness. I can't gain sympathy by
saying I went to offer my dear friend a fortune. I
didn't ; on the contrary, 1 went to ask my late
cherished chum for a trifling sum of money ; my
own, note, due to me on account of certain mutual
business transactions which had not been settled ;
but it seems if a man asks for his own now-a-days
he's insulted and treated as I have been."

The court here interposed and informed the
prisoner that his reflections had nothing to do with
the case in hand ; and he was ordered either to
Continue his cross-examination or to dismiss the
witness.

Florestan was obliged to have recourse to all his
patience. The Count's insolence was unbounded;
and it was impossible not to see that his coolness
and cleverness were producing an immense impression
in his favour. The most damning facts were
received with perfect equanimity; he turned every
phrase against him with a suspicion against the
witness, and Florestan was finally so nonplussed
as to be unable to speak without saying exactly
the opposite of what he originally intended, or contradictions
himself where contradiction was the one

thing to be avoided. The Count delayed with him
as a cat plays with a mouse. At last he said :

"I have nothing more to ask you, Mr, Florestan;
only beg to remark that you painfully exaggerate
that last scene. Yoii certainly verified the old saw,
that listeners hear no good of themselves."

A murmur ran through the court-room. Flores-tan's
evidence had excited such enthusiasm that
little more was left to verbal expression.

Charlotte Corday next took the stand. As is
usual when a negro or negress is seen in any
prominent position, the air resounded with rude
speeches : " How are you, auntie ? " " Guess it's going
to rain to-day." "The air is filled with thunder,"
etc., etc., but, silence finally imposed, Charlotte began
her recital. She took the oath with such solemnity
that a hush suddenly fell on the multitude. The
prosecution had put but few questions when the
Count, proof as usual against any sentiment, broke
out :

Well, auntie, it grieves me profoundly to see
you in this painful position. How things have
changed since last we met, eh ? I suppose you
have the same cock-and-bull story as Mr. Florestan
to relate. Well  when did you first sea me to know
me?"

Charlotte looked disdainfully at him, as if reflecting

whether or no she would answer, then
replied :

The first time I seed you, woz won day wen I
was in my massa's room  his study ; I was looking
for"

My God !" interrupted the prisoner, jumping up.
You were there ?  it was you ? If I had known
that you  "

"Silence!" screamed the crier; "dont interrupt
the witness."

Go on ! " cried the Count ; " go on ;  what else ? "

He vainly tried to hide his impatience, but when
Charlotte Corday described her visit to her master's
room, her hunt for the picture, and her long concealment
behind the curtain, he suddenly cried :

"That won't do! That is no evidence. If you
were hidden behind curtains, absolutely out of sight,
you couldn't have seen me  or, well, I admit I was
there ; but even had you tried  confess you're lying
you never saw any one but yourself ; and you were
gentlemen of the jury, I beg you will not pay any
attention to this evidence ; in fact, the old woman's
crazy. It's irreparable being black, but it's abominable
being crazy, and I  "

The judge interrupted, and ordered the prisoner
to use more polite language. The prosecution finally
elicited an important fact from Charlotte Corday in

answer to the question as to her recognition of the
prisoner.

When Massa Rozen thought he heard some one,
and came to look, he ses pulled dem curtains onside ;
but few 'em back in such a way he left a creak 
wich I could see few perfectly, but he couldn't seeme."


The prosecution here explained to the court's
satisfaction the way in which such a thing could
have taken place. The prisoner interrupted with
scoffing remarks, and finally Charlotte turned upon
him :

Tes she up, varmint. I leered everything then.
I saw you want to kill massa den and car. Massa
said, * I ain't word it ' ;  but you  golly, ef you're a
gub me a chance, I've a thought no more a putting'
you out of sight nor stamping' my heel on a saint's
head in de walk. I ses took yer disable face in, and
saw it as'in and ao'in in Lunnen too, and said then
the earth '11 never be clean till it's rid of you ! "

Charlotte's voice rose to such a pitch of rage that
it was impossible not to be impressed. The examination
continued, while the Count laughed
uproariously.

P. A. Question.  "What did the prisoner at the
bar say to the deceased ? Try and remember his
exact words."

Witness.  " He called Massa Vane, and made him
mad. Then he axed massa fur fifty thousand dollars,
and he said, ' I wanted to have dot last transaction
absolutely in my name.' Massa replied, ' You're
modest  is that all ? ' ' No,' ses the Count ; ' a man
muss be put out of the way, and  ' "

"That's a lie!" interrupted the prisoner; "a lie
blacker, if possible, than your face ! "

'silence in the court!" said the crier, while a
thrill of horror ran over the audience : the prisoner
was seen to chancre colour, and anon fretful drum
his fingers on the table, or rake them through his
hair.

Charlotte continued :

Massa wus struck, and said, ' A man  not
Arundel : ' but dot vivian 'plied  ' Suppose I should
say Mr. Florestan  ' "

This is too much ! " screamed the prisoner ; " am
I to have my life lied away by that low-lived
wench ? Were I in England I should be tried
by Peers; here  this civilized country, gentlemen
of the jury, I protest : wait till I cross-examine
her."

The judge arose, but for some moments tried in
vain to enforce silence. Charlotte's words had produced
an indescribable excitement, and none could
doubt their authenticity. Whilst her examination

VOL. III. R

went on, one could have heard a pin drop in the
room.

P. A. Question  " What did the deceased reply ? "

Answer.  " Massa went white, and sed, ' You are a
fiend incarnate. You think all the world like herself !
Why did I fall so low ?  you're a murderer, a villain,
and a scoundrel ! ' Then lie  massa  said : ' The end
muss com' som' time, why not now ? ' Golly, my hair
stud on end, but I didn't dare move, 'cause I said to
myself, ' Honey, you muss listen now to defend  ' "

The defence here interrupted the witness, and the
Judge ordered her to be more relevant. Poor
Charlotte's eyes rolled to their widest when she
heard the word relevant, and her facial and bodily
contortions were something beyond words. The
prisoner, court, and audience were in fits, whilst
the prosecution vainly tried to explain to her what
the word meant. The Count blandly interrupted
between his shrieks of laughter :

"It's all right, auntie. When one lies by the
yard as you do, it doesn't make the slightest difference
whether they do it clearly or not ! " Then he
was seized with another paroxysm, smelt his salts,
and finally gasped out, " Oh, this is too much ! I
shall certainly die of cramp ! "

The step between the sublime and ridiculous was
so slight a one that judge, jury, court, counsel, and

audience went off into one long scream ; the room
re-echoed again and again to the sound of hysterical
laughter. Flora nearly choked, trying to keep her
countenance. Adam Chromo was positively convulsed
; whilst Miss Chances-Cressy laughed till the
tears cane and watered her cheeks in long streaks
with a mixture of black, red, and white  a triple
combination of kohl, diluted bismuth, and cherry-paste.


The judge was the first to recover, whilst Charlotte,
dignified, although fuming with inward rage
at the interruption, was in such absolute ignorance
of its cause, that her attitude was only the more
amusing; but to look at her was to begin again.
Finally order was restored, but not silence, and her
examination recommenced. The above-named incident
had so changed the current of her recital,
however, that imagination kept pace with her words,
and saw fun in everything she did and said. One
could even see her skulking in the study, and
almost feel the contortions she must have made in
her forced concealment. Little by little, however,
she regained lost ground. A nothing sways a mob
or a criminal court, and when she neared the end of
her recital, and told how she had followed her master
to the Park, the excitement knew no bounds.

I followed 'im like a cat," she continued ; " he

R 2

met a man who gave 'im a slip of paper  a piece of
a torn card, den dis man went to the Park. Massa
Dozen followed him and I followed massa : in the
mean time massa sot down on a bench, and I naked
in a thicket right near back of him. Then I saw the
Count come up." Here followed a confused but
sufficiently clear statement of the conversation which
had taken place between the deceased and prisoner
at the bar up to the last scene. The prisoner's
interruptions were fabulous, but the witness went
bravely on :

He told massa he must have two hundred thousand
dollars ; then massa refused. Then I suddenly
saw Massa Florestan near, and I beckoned 'im to
come softly up to me  which he did  and heard all
the rest of the conversation. We was looking
anxiously when, lo and behold ! dot Count seized
Massa R-ozen, whipped out his bowie-knife, and stuck
him then and there. Self-defence ! Massa Eric
wouldn't have harmed a worm in his path. He had
begged the Count before to leave 'im, but he wouldn't ;
and the Count killed him, as he wanted to do that
day in massa' s own library, only he didn't dare. But
God 'full punish sou." She shook her fist at the
prisoner. " Spec's my skin's black, but your soul's
blacker den my whole body."

At this the audience burst into applause. The

crier in vain demanded order. There were screams
of " Lynch him, lynch him ! "  and even the prisoner
began to show a changing colour. The judge suddenly
ruled that unless silence were obtained the trial
would be conducted in secret, and the hubbub
finally subsided.

The Count tried in vain to cross-question
Charlotte ; she replied with such infinite cunning and
skill that, for the moment, he was absolutely quelled.
The prosecution certainly had a strong case, and as
one after another cave direct evidence it seemed
as though the prisoner were a maniac even to
attempt any defence.

Enilda's examination although short was a most
painful one, and tended mainly to prove the constancy
of the Count's visits to her father's house, his
friendly relationship with herself and father, and
the deceased's dying declaration which she had
witnessed ; what she thought of the Count of late,
etc. The Count's cross-examination was merely in
name.

Question.  bliss Rozen, you say you have seen me
many times: at present I will not ask you where
nor when ; I will merely remark that whether you
did or did not like me has nothing to do with the
case. On the contrary, I should have imagined you
did from your manners, than which those prevailing

at Schonbrun were not move courtly. I have always
admired you immensely, and so much regret giving a
lady trouble, that I beg you to believe me when I
repeat that I should be ashamed to put any questions
whatsoever to you, and beg you will consider yourself
dismissed."

The prisoner arose as he said these last words, and
bowing with the most courtly gravity, placed a hand
on his heart with a gesture which would not have
shamed Talma.

Enilda's examination closed the day's proceedings,
and the court adjourned until the following morning.
As the Count went out he threw kisses to several
ladies in the audience, bowed with his usual courtesy
to every human being he had ever known, and
stopping an instant said to the jury :

Gentlemen, believe me I am sorry to give you
such trouble. I shall drink your health this evening
in a bottle of Mother Aliquot's yellow label, and
only regret that I cannot have the pleasure of your
company  that I must drink alone. Good evening ;
ta, ta"  and his retreating figure was lost in the
crowd which closed around him, as his words were
lost in the storm of hisses which their frivolity had
aroused.

CHAPTER XII.

It was the fifth day of the trial, and the prosecution
were on the point of closing their case.

Early in the morning the court-room was densely
crowded. The weather was if possible brighter than
on the day previous ; there was a hum of cheerful
conversation, while now and then the echo of a
happy laugh rang around the vaulted chamber.
The judge, jury, and court were seated awaiting the
prisoner, who at last appeared in faultless attire,
scattering smiles right and left as he came in. His
exquisite form and airy motion exhaled the unconscious
fragrance that emanates from the waving
honeysuckle or the mountain-rose, he scented the
very air as he walked. As he passed by, the jury
sniffed, and the prosecuting attorney lifted his head
with the instinctive gesture of a desk-bound clerk
who after ten consecutive months of areas, pigeon-holes
and tiles, finds himself taking in a full

breath of sea or meadow air. The prisoner reached
his table, as usual heaped with jDiles of letters and
superb flowers, but no sooner sat down than he
jumped wp, declaring some one had put a pin in the
seat of the chair. He turned with a beaming look
towards the prosecution, and shook a playful finger
in Lawyer Harkins's face.

Confess," he said playfully ; " Harkins, you did it ;
you alone are capable of such a little joke ; but the
next time remember that  well, T am not like the
British soldier  padded ; and I not only see but
feel deeply the point of your little scheme."

The audience were in shrieks; even Harkins
laughed till he cried. The prisoner continued :

This is a droll country. Some devils wanted
me to start a new paper to describe my wrongs,
brought capital to the jail, and said I would have
all America at my feet when it was known how a
man of my rank was being treated, etc., etc. They
were journalists, poor fellows  wretched trade, but I
suppose a necessary one in an enlightened country.
I need not say I refused the proffered capital and
honour."

The Count sat down with a gentle sigh, and whilst
the clerk began the usual ceremony of declaring the
court opened, he " ah'd "  " eh'd "  smelt of first
one bouquet then another  murmured rapturously to

himself over the contents of one letter, or smiled
over the wit of another. He talked with his counsel,
who sat modestly at his right, or flung uncalled-for
sarcasms at the prosecuting attorney over the heads
of his nearest neighbours. His humour was something
so gay, so infectious, that its contagion spread
like a prairie fire ; even the judge found himself
smiling every now and then without the slightest
notion why. Ladies in the audience told risky
stories to their neighbours, and the jury looked as if
out on a holiday. The Attorney-general sat somewhat
away from his table, and with elaborate emphasis
dread special attention to the Count's witty
remarks; each time the assassin was particularly
brilliant he said joyfully :

Just listen to him  isn't he funny ? Isn't it justa
circus to Ijear him go on like that ? " etc., etc.

At last the trial resumed. Florestan and Enilda
having already given their evidence, as well as the
officers who had assisted at Rozen's death, the witness
to be examined to-day Alas Ricard, a certain
agent of the Rosen-Vane Copper Company. Many
witnesses had inadvertently helped the Count by
their testimony ; even Adam Chromo had been
obliged to state that in mutual affairs with the
deceased and prisoner, the latter's dealings had ever
been of the most honourable and cordial character.

The prosecution, sure of their case the first day, now
could not help feeling alarmed at the Count's growing
popularity. In short this gentleman so won
over court, jury, witnesses, and audience, that a
vague idea was current that he was a much-injured
man;  he had done well to put such a wretch as
Rozen out of the way, etc., etc.

Ricard entered the witness-box and was handed
the Bible.

As soon as the Count saw him he put his hands
on his hips and burst into such fits of laughter that
the court in vain called " Order-silence  order!"
When the prisoner could speak from choking, he
pointed a finger at Ricard, and gasped out :

*' Oh ! this is too rich !  look at him, do look at
him!"

Every one looked. The clerk snatched away the
Holy Book, and was about to present it a second
time with the usual formula, when a second outburst
from the Count and the audience caused him to
withdraw it with a bewildered but also gradually
dawning smile.

Look at the witness," continued the prisoner.

Do you know him ? " interrupted the counsel for
the State, addressing himself to the Count.

Do I know him ? Well, I've kicked him out of
my house often enough to know him ; but, by the

way, excuse my smile, and pardon the frankness of
an early friend. I know you, Harkins ; it's no use 
that last little racket we had at High Bridge, etc.,
etc. But to continue ;  you hand him a Bible, you
ask him to swear ;  oh no, that's really too good ! "

The Count burst into another scream, and buried
his head deep amongst the Jacqueminots on his
table. A third time the clerk put the question,
'' You hereby swear to," etc., and presented the sacred
book. Ricard this time really took it into his hands,
when the prisoner suddenly jumped to his feet, and
slapping his hand vigorously on his table, cried :

This performance is too much, it is an insult to
ny gentleman. Women and men of America, it's
an insult to you and to your religion, bought with
the price of the blood of millions of Christians. He
swear !  he know the value of an oath ! Let him
swear, if he wants to, on a package of some of his
old clothes sold in Chatham Street. He know the
nature of an oath ! Why, you only want one glance
at him to know that his ancestors took part in the
Crucifixion, and that he himself has never been
baptized on the forehead. Oh no,  oh no, Harkins,
that won't do."

The Count sat calmly down ; but the court and
witness were so much moved that for a moment
nothing could be heard but a pro and con hubbub of

explanation. After im possible interruptions the witness
announced that he was of Israelite descent, but
now a Catholic, and perfectly capable of taking the
oath ; whereupon it was administered to the accompaniment
of a Babel of voices and such ejaculations
from every one near the Count, that a stranger to
the solemnity of American murder trials turned to
a friend, and said :

Really one might perfectly well take the scene
for a most animated conversazione."

The prosecuting attorney questioned Ricard.

Q.  "How long have you known prisoner at the
bar ? "

A.  "Longer than ever I should like to tell."

Yes, damn it I " interrupted the Count, " I
should think so ; I have been his best friend. I 
go on."

Qiocstion. P. A.  "When did you first meet the
prisoner at the bar ? "

A.  Nervously. " Must I answer that ? "

The court. " Decidedly."

Oh, I'll answer for him," interrupted the Count.
"Ricard's a poor devil; I met him years ago in
Hamburg. He was a footman; seemed to have
some disposition for the career, so I took him into
my service, and finally kicked him out for  for being
a fool. He ran across me in America, and told a

tale of how he had not got on in life, and be-fed
me to help him to some new place."

P. A.  "And he really helped yon ?"  to witness.

Prisoner.  " Look here, Harkins, don't speak of
me in that stand-offish fashion. Pray remember my
birth. Help him ?  why I got him a place with
Rozen. Look here, you vile brute, didn't I  haven't
I done everything for you ? Say what you've got
to say and leave the box, I'm tired of looking at
you."

The audience burst into applause. " Silence ! "
thundered the clerk of the court. The examination
went on.

P. A.  " Now, Mr. Ricard, will you kindly tell me
what you know of the prisoner at the bar at the
time you first met in Hamburg ? "

Ricard paled, rubbed his hands, and looking
anxiously around as if seeking some familiar eye,
began :

"When I knew him at Hamburg, he called
himself the Baron Marcie. I was his footman. He
lived in grand style, but was arrested for swindling,
implication in a murder, and was  "

"You're a d  d bar!" shrieked the Count; "and
if I could get near to you, you'd never say that again
to me. Gentlemen, thes is a put-up job," he said,
addressing the court and jury ; " he tried to black mail

me the other day. T wouldn't stand it ; he tried
the same thing on with my dear friend Rozen, and
you see now ;  look at him  the man is mad, and
I call upon the court to remove this witness."

Judge  "Prisoner at the bar, silence! Mr. Ricard,
be good enough to continue your evidence."

W.  " A murder, and  "

That a lie," said the Count.

W.  "A murder, and was tried  "

That's another lie "  same interruption, this time
without looking up from his table.

P. A.  " Witness, continue."

W.  " He was tried and sentenced to  "

'will you shut up!" screamed the prisoner;
what do you want to lie like that for ? Say that
you where sentenced, that you got the galleys for life,
or at least merited them, but  "

The judge suddenly sat bolt upright.

Order ! " his honour cried. " The prisoner at the
bar must observe the rules of the court, or be
removed."

A loud and emphatic general chorus of "Yes 
yes  yes " followed this announcement. Ricard assumed
a waiting attitude, and was again requested
to continue.

At this juncture the Count began to hum in an
undertone, " Mother, may I go out to swim ? " beating

the measure in a gentle tattoo on the leg of the
table.

Ricard continued his testimony, and the Count his
refrain ; but, like Florestan, the former was soon
completely off his balance. He recapitulated and
wavered to such an extent that even the judge
offered ruling, and was obliged to put questions
categorically as to their recent connection with the
prisoner. In spite of this Ricard was back on the
subject of Hamburg, and repeated himself so prodigiously
that Harkins began to despair.

Question. P. A.  '' How long were you in the service
of, not the prisoner at the bar, but of deceased ? "

W. " Well, if I had stayed with the  the prisoner
as I had at first intended ; but he lived in grand
style only for a  "

Interruption. Prisoner again without looking up :
"That's stale; we've heard that twenty times; 
give us something fresh, my good Ricard." "
Witness.  " For a year."

Well  well  well ! " screamed the Count, this
time raising his head ;  " a year ! Why, you've more
cheek than an army mule ; a year !  you weren't
with me three months."

District Attorney, ignoring prisoner's interruption,
continued :

Guinea trial, Washington, 1882.

P. A.  "I asked you how long you were in the
service of deceased ? "

Witness.  " 1  I  well  I met Mr. Rozen, and he
liked me very much. I worked for him six years or
more ; the Count spoke of Hamburg  "

Curse Hamburg," interrupted the prisoner.
Ricard, I guess if you don't want to hang yourself
you'd better shut up; you're making more rope for
yourself out of nothing than a year's crop of hemp
on a Texas farm would produce."

This little sally was received with general laughter.

Ricard went on talking, the Count humming ;
finally the latter said good-naturedly :

Oh, go on with your lies, Ricard, if you like.
I don't bear malice. Look here ; how much have the
other side paid you to come here and chirp those
infernal Hamburg reminiscences ? but  gad, I may
say thanks, for it serves to remind me of those
adorable days of the past. However, I must add,
when my dear friend Joe  I beg your pardon, His
Majesty  "

Hear him," whispered the Attorney-general,
nudging Mr. Pastor ; " what do you think of him ? "

'' Oh," rejoined Pastor, " delightful ; quite like the
Palais Royal; are all American murder trials like
this ? "

*'0h, not quite all," frankly admitted the man of

law ; " but this is a special one, from the fact of the
exalted station of all parties concerned. But that
man  clever, you know  foreign name or not, he
defends himself like an American. Listen to him ;
see how he tries to amuse the jury."

How he does amuse the jury ! " cried Pastor.

Come now," interrupted the Count, " I still have
a blank cheque-book ; I bear no malice ; let us  but
judge, by the way, why should wee hurry this
gentleman ? What do you say to a bit of luncheon ? "

The audience seemed struck by the wisdom of
this remark. The judge hemmed  hawed  and
after spitting into the enamelled cuspidor at his left,
really started to take out his watch, but compromised
by only glancing up at a huge uncouth clock,
modelled after the first Strasbourg effort, jauntily
bracketed between two windows on the east side of
the court-room. The hour of one marked on the
open face of this primitive time-keeper spoke in
eloquent favour of the prisoner's motion.

"Well," said Adam Chromo, "not to put too fine
a point upon it, the old clock on the stairs seems
to be the only clear-headed thing in this concern.
I think I'll just chip out and have a blue point stew
and get in again. What do you think of Ricard's
testimony ? "

He addressed himself to Florestan, who muttered
VOL. III. / s

a few words in response, then turned to Flora,
Enilda, and Miss Chances-Cressy, the former answered
by a " Yes' and for the next few moments
nothing was heard but lively chatter all around.

The court adjourned for half-an-hour for luncheon.
The Count made his way out under his escort as
smilingly as he had come in. A cloud of waiters
suddenly seemed floating about with suspicious-looking
baskets filled with fruits and food for the
many who did not care to leave the court-room.
Benches were turned into tables, and the air was filled
with the cheerful buzz and hum of a perfectly contented
crowd. Men, women, and children rushed
laughing and talking, hither and thither, and some
little boys tried sly games of ball or marbles on the
court-room floor. Had there been giant trees, a lawn
and a river in sight in the distance, without the
slightest difficulty one could have imagined the scene
an American Sunday School picnic. As it was, its
hilarity was undeniable, and no amount of bare walls,
benches, or instruments of the law could detract
from the gaiety of this typical reunion. Punctually
to the moment the Court and public re-entered.

Ricard was still in the witness-box, but he seemed
suddenly possessed with a bad memory. " The murder
rumour," he said, " was unimportant. The Baron ashe
then was, went away, and some said he'd gone to

his country seat; others that he had been transported."
The prisoner at the bar simply laughed
at every word Ricard said, and finally added :

Ricard, I guess you'd better let up on the Hamburg
business, or  "

I protest," said the counsel for the prosecution,
"the prisoner is intimidating the witness."

The judge, as is usual after the jury have calmly
taken in the things they ought not to hear, spoke
up energetically, admonishing that august body
that the remarks about Hamburg were irrelevant,
and could not be admitted as evidence. " ' Somebody
said ' is not evidence," declared his honour. " The
witness must either know or not know personally,
how and in what manner the prisoner at the bar
left Hamburg, otherwise his remarks cannot be considered
relevant." The judge sat down.

Then," said the Count, addressing the witness,
"you blundering old blockhead, can't you get up
now and flit before you're called off."

"Silence in the court!" The crier was beginning
to look pale, anxious, and haggard-eyed ; even his
voice faltered as he pronounced the last word.

The Count turned angrily round and addressed
himself to the clerk. "Shut up yourself; it strikes
me this is my funeral, and if any one has got a
right to say anything, I have."

S 2

This speech was followed by a general series of
expostulations from court, judge, and attorneys.
Whilst the excitement was at its height, a lady,
closely-veiled and dressed in black, quietly entered
the room ; she was ushered in by a mysterious youth
wearing a bland but rather idiotic smile.

Mr. Harkins arose and addressed himself to the
judge.

"I think, your honour, the witness Ricard maybe
dismissed for the present, but we will call for
him tomorrow; meanwhile I have the names of
several other witnesses who might be re-examined,
amongst others, Mr. Chromo." The court repeated
the name without receiving any response ; Mr.
Chromo was called again. "Not here!" some one
answered. '' He has not returned to the court since
luncheon."

"But I am here," called out a muffled voice; and
the veiled lady, who had entered a few moments
previously, quietly made her way round back of the
jury, and before any one could expostulate was
hastily conducted into the witness-box.

"What's this?" said Harkins. " Voluntary testimony
? From whom ? " The lady raised her veil.
' Mrs. Chromo ! " he ejaculated. " Impossible ! you
were too ill to leave your bed."

Sensation in the Court. At that very moment

Adam Chromo entered the room, saw his wife in
the box, and gasped :

Lucy Chromo, what are you doing there ? "

The Count half rose in his seat, and waved a
ringed white hand towards her.

My cherished friend ! " he cried ; " this is indeed
kind. Welcome, welcome ! "

"Silence in the court!" thundered the clerk; at
the same time the oath was administered to the
lady. Absolutely ignoring the nature of Mrs. Chrome's
testimony, the prosecution cautiously began :

Q.  " When did you first meet the defendant in
this case ? "

Lucy clasped her hands, and raised her eyes
towards heaven.

Sir," she responded, " this is unkind ; you begin
by touching such a tender chord. Where did I first
meet him ? Years ago, when I was a happy child
in my mother's house in Schonhegan, and he told
me that he loved me ! "

What ! " screamed Adam Chromo, " and you
dare* to speak of a thing like that at a time like
this ! "

Silence ! " thundered the clerk, brinincy his mace
to the floor in a terrible thud.

Mr. Harkins tried in vain to get near enough to
Lucy Chromo to stop her; but a new order, "Do

not interrupt the witness," this time from the judge,
was followed by a momentary silence.

Q. P. A.  "You say you met the prisoner at the
bar ? "

Lucy raised her eyes, and murmured to herself:
'' Think of his being called that, and all on my
account ! "

At the bar," continued the prosecution, '' when
sou were a young girl ? We do not like to put indelicate
questions to a lady, but could you tell  ?"

Oh, you mean how old am I ? " burst out Lucy,
sobbing. " What can it matter if I tell the truth ?
Thirty-seven;  it was twenty years ago, and I've
loved him all my life. Oh sir ! I'm a miserable
woman ; I'm utterly wretched ! It's all along of
glue. Now that I'm here I wish I wasn't. Don't
stop me ; let me go on ; let me tell the truth  God
knows I truly love him 1 "

The judge, jury, court, and public truly wondered
what was coming.

At this juncture Lucy lifted a lace handkerchief
to her deluged eyes, and for an instant nothing was
heard but short and hysterical muttering.

Amazement kept Adam Chromo speechless in his
seat, whilst the court seemed equally struck dumb.
Before one could address her, however, she tore the
morsel of linen from her face and went on :

"I think I've used him very badly, and I now say
here before everybody  I mean I really love him
and none other ! "

Q. P. A.  " We must beg the witness to be rather
more relevant. I beg your pardon, but what has
that to do with this case ? You say you have known
the prisoner at the bar  "

Twenty years," interrupted Lucy with dignity.

A low whistle echoed through the court-room.
The Count rose hastily, followed by his counsel, who
at this juncture thought proper to put a question
to the witness; and before his client could speak he
said :

You say yon have known him twenty years ? "
The prisoner at the bar turned pale. " Let up on
that," he whispered ; '' when the time comes I'll
cross question her' motioning the indiscreet questioner
back into his seat.

Mr. Hark ins rose. " I think we may safely ask
one question : How long  "

"Ask me anything you like!" wailed Lucy. "I
shall still repeat, ' Long enough to have known how
to treat him better.' Don't stop me ; let me speak
now and tell all the truth. He would not give up
business; I said then it must be a divorce. If he
prefers glue to me, then let him stick to it. But
now the Count has betrayed me; he is married to

two women, and one dead  " The Count vainly
tried to stop the witness ; she continued, turning to
the latter, whom she saw smiling at his table.

Oh, laugh ! heartless monster, laugh ! I know
all ; Fraulein Marx has told all, and I  do you
think if I were fifty times free, I would ever marry
you ? No. I give up the idea for ever. I hate
glue ; but I shall stick to it. I swear I will not be
divorced ;  I  "

Stop ! " thundered the judge, rising and spitting
with violence in the gorgeous cuspidor. " Stop ! 
this is ofoino' too far ; remove the witness ! "

The wildest excitement prevailed. Adam Chromo
rushed to his wife ; Harkins rushed to Chromo ; Lucy
screamed, and refused to leave the witness-box.
The Count kept yelling, " Quite right ; stay there,
stay there ! "

How dare you treat me so ! " she ejaculated
between her sobs. " I  I  haven't I a right to say
what I want to at my own divorce suit ? "

"Divorce!" said the judge. "Divorce!" echoed
Flora. '' Divorce ! " echoed the Count ;  " the
woman's mad ! "

Lucy turned pale.

Oh ! " she gasped ; " what do you mean ? Going
mad ? Ah ! ah 1 I see it all now. A young man
took me by the arm,  ' In here,' he said ; ' explain

nothing ; then when you're name is called, rush into
the witness-box.' I knew you were deceiving me !
You too, Harkins ; you didn't want to tell me when
the day was, but I accidentally read in the ' Herald's '
law list  Chromo vs. Chromo, and I felt at once that
you wanted the case to come off and not let me
know. Then too  I  I felt sorry for him. But
you"  she shook her fist in the face of judge, jury,
and court  " fiends incarnate ! you have gone and
divorced me without my knowledge ! I am  but I
refuse to go till I've had my say; I swear I love
him, let all the world hear it ;  I am still his wife,
and refuse to leave him, I will not be Divorced
there"  and sobbing she flung herself into her
husband's outstretched arms, and buried her head
on his shoulder.

Remove the witness ! " again thundered the judge.
No ; let her stay ! " screamed the audience. " Remove
the witness!" yelled his honour; "is the
sanctity of a murder trial  "

Lucy suddenly came to.

"What!" she cried; "what do I hear? Isn't
this my divorce going on ? What is this suit
any way ? "

"This, madam," said the prosecuting attorney
pleasantly ; " this is the Rozen murder trial ; you
are evidently labouring under some little mistake."

"Mistake?  murder!" screamed Lucy. *'Alil I
see now, ah !  ah !  with what I've gone through.
This isn't my divorce after all ! Husband  help ! I
faint, I die ! " and pawing the air frantically, Lucy
Chromo fell in a dead swoon back in Adam Chromo's
arms. It is impossible to describe the effect of Lucy
Chromo's words ; and equally impossible to describe
the scene which ensued. When the reason of her
appearance was thoroughly understood, in spite of
her fainting, the court could no longer contain itself,
and joined with the public in the general uproar.

Enildci, Flora, Miss Chances-Cressy, Florestan and
Professor Protoplasm hastily followed Adam Chromo
out. He bore his wife in his strong arms as if she
had been a feather weight, and the expression on
his face would have baffled a Rembrandt.

This episode really closed the day's proceedings.
Several unimportant witnesses were examined, but
their irrelevance threw the court in such disarray
that the judge abruptly announced adjournment
till the morrow, and thus closed the fifth day of the
celebrated Rozen murder trial.

CHAPTER XIII.

The sixth day began with testimony from Chicago
detectives come to establish the identity of the
prisoner with that of the notorious Black Bill, who
years before had escaped from the jail on the night
of the great fire of '71. This was not easy; and
Pinkerton's police, although as celebrated as the
Russian " Third Section," Scotland Yard, or the
famous Parisian Bureaux, were obliged to admit
they could not swear that the Count de Marcie and
D'Orbach and the ruffian, forger, and criminal
Black Bill, were one and the same man. Having
had no photograph of the villain, it was impossible
to say positively that the detained nobleman was
really the one whose name had become such a terror
in the \est. Black Bill was known to have had a
slight scar on his left arm, whilst the nobleman De
Marcie had not alone a scar but a curious, cut or
blister which extended nearly to the elbow, and was

altogether different from the one worn by Black Bill.
As to the officers who would swear to this identity
through having seen him in the Chicago jail, two
were dead and one a lunatic ; hence the prisoner at
the bar need fear nothing from them.

The trial dragged on. It seemed as if half New
York were subpoenaed either for the prosecution or
the defence. The former were still hard at it, and the
court-room if possible was more crowded than ever ;
perhaps a waiting world came also in the hopes of
assisting at another Lucy Chromo episode. In vain
the daily press teemed with news of the trial. The
Chromo divorce furnished, if possible, a more ample
theme, until the announcement was publicly made
that the suit was withdrawn, and Lucy Chromo as
suddenly surprised Gotham by appearing at the trial
on  Adam Chrome's arm.

The weeks had dwindled into months, and still the
Count de Marcie was held in durance vile. After the
failure of Pinkerton to prove that he was Black Bill
public opinion changed, and people asked one another
if the noble prisoner were not really a victim to
personal spite and revenge, and speculation became
rife as to the probable issue of the trial.

December came with its snow and sleet, and the
succeeding weeks witnessed the same brilliant audiences,
the same enthusiasm, and the same light,

cheerful conversation which had been noticeable on
former occasions. On the morning of the '31st, a
bright, crisp day had attracted a very full house, more
than half the public being ladies. When the Count
came in, his appearance was somewhat comical owing
to the extreme cold. He was shivering, and muffled up
in a great-coat. He complained of the cold, and the
audience heartily concurred with him, for the room
was enormous, and lack of heat caused every one to
shiver. Of late the noble prisoner had been somewhat
crusty and coldhearted, but the cheerful
sunlight that streamed through the great windows
seemed to exercise a joyous influence over him ; and
the court, jury, the counsel and audience laughed
and re-laughed as he with earnest simplicity shouted
out that one of his guards, a member of the New"
York police, "had had an eleven pound little baby
presented to him as a New Year's gift"*

After this the Count's interruptions where casual
and far apart. Whilst examining his mail he would
alternately read and write. Owing to the absence of
Lawyer Harkins and the Judge there were no very
exciting scenes. It was believed that the able
Harkins and the Judge were not on very good
terms, as it was only yesterday when Judge W 
with a friend entering a restaurant near Del's to get
Report, Guinea Trial, 1882.

a dozen on the half-shell and a bottle of porter for
lunch, espying Harkins said disgustedly, " Let us go
somewhere else." It seemed evident to all that the
Judge had a liking on the quiet for the Count, and
yet at times, during the prisoner's cross-examination,
his voice rolled thunder and his eye flashed
hire.

The witnesses were well under way giving important
testimony, when the prisoner at the bar took
the opportunity of saying that two men had called at
the jail to see him, and after the honour of being
presented had refused to shake hands with him.

They're loafers and cranks," he said irately ;
they are perfect dogs ; they came to insult a high-toned
gentleman, and when I get out I'll know how
to be even with them."

In vain the crier ordered silence in the court ; the
prisoner remarked, " that this was his funeral, and
he was going to see the corpse safe through."

Finally the prisoner's counsel began the defence,
and called witness after witness. They were all
more or less unimportant, until the name Friiulein
Marx was heard, and Ida's lady companion made
her way into the box.

In the mean time the prosecution and defence
remarked that it was not known when the trial
would finish, as after the ordinary defence would

come evidence in sur-rebuttal, and there were still
an hundred witnesses.

Oh ! I don't mind," cried out the Count, " my
time is well spent here, and in jail I do little else
than to write autographs."

He stopped abruptly as Fraulein Marx took the
oath and prepared to answer the questions which
might be put to her.

The Count's attitude was one of eager expectancy.
It was noticed that he had become thinner these
latter days, and his face wore a strange smile. The
question : " When did you first know the prisoner at
the bar ? " put by the prosecution elicited a prompt
response :

A.  " I met him in Hamburg twenty years ago.
He was a robber and a scoundrel, called himself a
Baron, and was transported with me for criminal
complication in a murder."

The prisoner's eager look turned to one of blank
disappointment, rage, then bitter hate ; a cold glitter
crept into his eyes. He stretched out his hand and
laughed as he said :

So you betray me at last ; you want revenge.
Well  well  well ;  curse you, get it if you can."

The excitement amongst the audience became
intense. His counsel hastily conferred with him and
several waiting? friends. There was a confused murmur

throiiffliout the room, whilst the witness stood with
an impassive face and calmly folded hands, looking
neither to the right nor left, but seemingly in air.
After more discussion a second question was asked.
The answer came with amazing promptitude.

I married you because I loved you and wanted
to be a Baroness, but you betrayed even me. I got
away from Toulon in a way intended for your escape
came to sew York  and very soon recognized in
the Count de Marcie the ex-Baron de Maine of
Hamburg."

Stop the witness," screamed the prisoner, turning
of a still more awfid pallor. " Stop her ; she's the
bif:caest liar  "

Fraulein Marx smiled scornfully.

Nothing can stop me," she said. " I escaped 
as you did afterwards ; and the German Government
has since bestowed a free pardon on me."

"Which explains your cheek now," cried the
prisoner ; " and you knew it  when ? "

Before I saw you in London," she replied calmly,
'' when I wanted the two hundred thousand dollars."

The Count laughed ;  laughed until the tears
rolled down his cheeks.

Look at her," he said ; " isn't she a wife any man
might be proud of? Look at her and realize how
worthy a woman I married."

Oh I " interrupted Lucy Chromo in a loud
voice ; " oh !  and to think that he not only married
Ida Forestii, and broke her heart, but boo-ed
me to get a divorce in order to marry him !  the
wretch ! "

It was impossible not to understand and fully
appreciate Lucy's words. The court re-echoed with
exclamations, and the witness was not able to cro on
until order was restored.

She told the history of her life, and the noble
prisoner's; of the meeting with Ricard ; the plot to
make Rozen rob and betray Arundel; the final
rupture, and the meeting in the Park. The public
were roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by
her recital, yet with the exception of the prisoner's
scornful and frequent interruption, the dropping of
a pin could easily have been heard.

I let him  the prisoner  think that I was for
him," she added with a rising voice ; " but revenge is
sweeter than mone3\"

"Yes," cried the prisoner, "when you have all
the latter you want, and are sure about the
former."

"Then a fire of mutual abuse and retort took
place between witness and prisoner. The crier no
longer cried silence; the judge no longer gave any
ruling; the questions and answers were categories or

VOL. III. T

were not; the same mutual>olley of recrimination
and insult went on between these two strange and
strangely-related human beings.

At last the prisoner arose with a threatening look,
but suddenly sank backwards.

Take her away," he cried ; " she'll be my death."
Then he placed a hand to his side and looked wildly
about.

The witness continued, and shrewd cross-questions
brought out such alarming statements that the
prisoner had little show for mercy. The tale of Ida
Forestii's life caused a profound sensation, and many
an eye filled with tears when she described her
death. The witness's cold voice but added to the
pitifulness of the story, and after that there was little
to tell : she was dismissed and other witnesses were
brought forth ; each and all more or less fatal to the
defence. Suddenly the prisoner's counsel announced
their case was closed.

The surprise was so great that judge, prosecution,
and jury stared for some moments in a helpless sort
of maze ; an indefinable murmur ran through the
court-room; and at last his honour comprehended
that the trial was really at an end. The prosecuting
attorney looked upon the announcement as a practical
joke, and was so unbounded at the trial's abrupt
termination that he could scarcely find suitable words

in which to argue the case to the jury. His peroration,
however, was a brilliant affair, although when
he had concluded it was difficult to make out
whether he thought the prisoner guilty or not.
Happily his honour then gently hinted at murder,
and gave the jury to understand that a crime of
some sort had been committed in which the prisoner
was implicated.

The Count next arose with a beaming smile, and
remarked that he had a few words to say; whereupon
he bowed to the audience, nodded to the jury,
and blowing a white rose open to its fullest, adjusted
it in his button-hole and began :

Ladies, and gentlemen of the jury, you see
before you not a criminal, but an unsuccessful man.
I don't need to plead not guilty, because I'm going
to tell you truthfully the real story of my life ; and
I know, in a land where struggle is known and
appreciated, when you have heard mine you will one
and all but sympathize with me the more. I shall
be obliged to inflict some painful disillusions upon
you, but in a land where success must be bought
at any price, you will realize that I am indeed
worthy to be one of you. I early took for my motto
the words of Horace, ' Nil mortality artium est,'
and determined to make my way in life and prove
them at any cost. I shall be brief: the worthy

T 2

witnesses' pros and cons that you have heard are one
and all incomplete, idiotic, no one so far having told
you my whole career from the beginning ; helpless
blunders have so exasperated the artistic in my
nature, that I feel it a duty I owe my talent, my
exceptional education, and the world in general,
to explain more fully; in fact I owe it to the
gracious interest Gotham has ever taken in me,
to tell her all I can about myself; and that all
shall be told as faithfully as I know how to tell it :
as Brutus said, 'If ye have any tears, prepare to
shed them now.' My life has been a long conflict,
a bitter struggle to succeed and put the best foot
forward in the world. It has been short in one
sense, but prolific of adventure. I was born a
beggar in the streets of Mayence; parents, first in
particular  unknown. In early youth I rose to the
estate of barber: not caring to continue that humble
but happy life, I longed to adventure and seethe
world. I am still young and  I have seen it.
In a Mayence barbers-shop a client used to come
to whom I bore a startling resemblance ; an absurd
intimacy grew up between ns, and one day the idea
struck me to put him out of the way, adopt his name,
title, and estate. This I did with great punctuality,
and became in twelve short hours the Baron de
Maine. I do not seek to affect you here, although

any one with a spark of soul or feeling Las only
to reflect on the audacity of my first stroke, not
to also realize what fears, what agonies of mind
and body I endured; not alone that of being
found out, but of checking in its birth a career
destined to reflect honour on any beggar, and do
good in any world where courage, talent, and heart
go hand in hand. Born to the gutter I tired of the
palace, went to Hamburg, and there met and adored
the gentle being you have just listened to, whose
wit never equalled either her heart or her beauty. I
married her. We became partners in  not iniquity
but the modern commerce of getting on in life.
Frau Marx-maine soon began to bore me. Money
was low, spirits were lower; a robbery and murder
done in Lyons with sure intentions, but not sure
hands  alas 1 interrupted our career for a little while.
Toulon was not a disagreeable place, but my venturesome
spirit longed to attempt new deeds of
daring. I felt the ardour of a Napoleon or a
Bernadotte glowing in my veins, and bitterly chafed
at the dungeon's restriction. I escaped f heard the
dear wife was dead ; then became confidential
adviser, butler, valet, I don't know what, to several
sovereigns : couldn't stand the routine of royal life.
Slavery?  why the galleys was ease compared toit.
I longed to see the home of my youth,

returned to Mayence, and found an old uncle, who
kindly removed the ' T. F.' so wickedly branded on
my arm ; convenient slashes now and then, added to
a real scald  result of a railway smash-up  effectually
obliterated all traces of the convict's signature.
Dear uncle, he is since dead  "

At this there was a visible interruption, and loud
murmurs echoed and re-echoed in the court-room.

Your uncle," inadvertently called out the prosecuting
attorney ; " surely not the late Count ? "

Visions of a cathedral draped in black ; a choir
of mortals sinoincr celestial music ; the rich baritone
of a sainted voice ; the smell of incense  even the
odour of violets  and the stately congregation of
Gotham's best  a weeping world, passed in instantaneous
panorama before the minds of all present.
The prisoner took up and finished the lawyer's
phrase.

The same," he said gently ; " a good man  alas !
no Count  although well worthy to be one. He
died as he had lived  a simple sausage-maker of
Mayence." '

What ! " screamed Mrs. Chromo. " What ! " cried
the lawyer ; and " What I " were repeated on all
sides.

The prisoner smiled blandly and reiterated his
words.

"This is too much," groaned Lucy; "and my crape
dress, amethyst necklace, and the flowers, the postponing
of two balls, and as many as ten quiet
luncheons  all, all for a sausage-maker ! "

The club flags at half-mast," murmured Florestan.

"The city-bell tolling down town," said Adam
Chromo.

"Yes," echoed Lawyer Harkins, "and Gotham's
Common Council meeting solely to pass resolutions
of condolence to be offered to the Count."

The postponement of our Chromo Literary Society
for a month," groaned Prof. Protoplasm, wiping his
brow with a lemon-coloured handkerchief.

"The condolences telegraphed by the President,"
said the head juror.

He was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing
and half-strangled sobs which emanated from the
judicial chair. His honour did not need to say
what his and his wife's expression of regret had
been. What they had cost ! Every one present remembered
them. In a vision he saw himself sending
word to the Bench, " Too ill to sit to-day,"  saw
himself flying to the tailor's to try on a new black
suit ; saw a fond wife and mother sacrificing the one
public dinner she gave during the year; and as ina
horrid nightmare felt himself writing, signing, and
sending, an elaborate epistle attached to a basket of

orchids, Yllose every shade of colour was worth a
fortune to a modest horticulturist :  all these efforts,
and not for a defunct Count, but for a dropsical,
dirty  ah !

He fanned himself Violently, gasped, threw back
his head as much as to say, "I am better now,"
then waving his hand wdtli graceful ease directed
the prisoner to continue.

I am really grieved," said this latter honestly,
to have given you all such a shock ; but how can
you appreciate the noble efforts I have made to
get on unless you know the truth of those efforts ?
Judge, Mrs. Chromo, Mr. Florestan, ladies and
gentlemen, let me thank you all here now for those
expressions of woe ; letters, flowers, and hand-pressures
of silent sympathy bestowed upon me at that
critical moment; for, believe me, it Alas a critical
moment, and required no small energy, misgivings,
and art, to play it upon Nev York as I played it ;
especially when you realize that that uncle died
fifteen years ago, and the wheels of memory almost
refused to run backward. But to my tale :  I came
to America; I met Rozen, an honest man but weak;
he wanted speedy wealth, but hated great risks. I
finally won him over, named him Vane for a travelling
name, got him in my power, and only put him
out of it dien  I put him out of the way. Oh !

don't look horrified !  remember that I felt bound,
some way, to elevate Gotham and her moral society.
I felt that here I had found my true vocation and
right place ; here a title and such talent as I possessed
could find the fittest scope for action. I have
done five years of good service here in every branch
of social life. Rozen stole money ; I spent it, in
first helping myself and then doing good to others.
Mind, I am not the first man nor the last who
personally applies Machiavelli's saying, ' The first
law of every human being is to protect himself  to
live  and  to look out for number one.' That is
just what I have always rigorously done, and I
advise you all to follow in my footsteps. Be careful,
however, never to have anything to do with white-livered
fools and soft-hearted ones. Rozen was
sentimental even when he helped Black Bill to
escape."

Black Bill ! " echoed a dozen voices.

Yes, gentlemen. Black Bill ; I am that distinguished
individual Sorry I can't tell you all
his history here ; but as this is the century for
memoirs, I have no doubt you will before long be
speedily enlightened as to all his proceedings. As
to the little Prima Donna, I am sorry that she took
the affair to heart ; but jou remember Julia and the
Don: 'Man's love is of man's life,' etc. etc. Most

jurymen have a weakness for Byron, and all seem
to know the lines. I won't repeat them here, but
women are all alike, take an episode for  an eternity,
etcetera. I fear I am tiring you : but a few words
more. I don't ask for my life, as you are sure to
give me that; but I do ask the court to restore
a trunk of relics, carried wantonly off  stolen probably
by the police ; these relics I need not say are a
souvenir of my tender past, my earliest youth, when
ambition warmed me with her glowing fires, and
hope was the one lamp of my barber's existence.
That trunk contains all my shaving implements ; the
razors with which I shaved the Baron ; the old
clothes I wore; some letters from my wife Adele,
when love was our sole collateral, and a bunch of
faded flowers, which alone have power to awaken
in me glad memories of a hapjy coast. How many
times after an evening at some ball the Baron would
return home, look at his razors, and laugh as the
barber at the way he had fooled the world as the
Baron 1 Oh ! my friends, those were sweet and invaluable,
unpurchasable hours ! Restore me that
trunk, that even in my cell I may re-live them. I
cannot say I found society-life agreeable,  jostling
with fools, hob-robbing with snobs, associating with
idiots. Alas ! how often, tired of the whole game,
have I cried out with Mirabeau : 'My God, give me

mediocrity,' but my cry was never heeded. So I
kept on the treadmill, repeating in my heart with
Telemachus : ' Services ! talents 1 merit  bah ! belong
to a cotery '  and I did. I must say I have found
New York the easiest of all society, as here only two
things are required  money and title. I have told
you my faithful but partial history, as to the last
wishing to do good, I see no earthly reason why every
enterprising American may not alone follow in my
footsteps but profit by my career ; but let him beware
of three things, however, any one of which may at
any moment wreck the brightest of futures ;  satiety
of too much money  indigestion  and not keeping
cool. The first engendered irritation ; the second, bad
temper ; and the third, for the first time in my life,
caused me to stand in my own light, to forget myself,
and  and I struck the blow which brought me here.
I take leave of you, gentlemen of the jury, and beg
you will restore my cherished trunk, and bear in
mind that I am merely a faithful follower, as all
Americans should be, of the Macchiavellian precept :
'The first law of every human being is to protect
himself, and  to live.

The prisoner sat down amidst deafening cheers.
His defence had indeed touched the enterprising
American soul. After a charge from the Judge the
jury retired; hours passed; his Honour looked

heavenward with vacant face but strangely questioning
eyes ; counsel and prosecution consulted together.
The wildest chattering went on in the audience
when the foreman re-appeared.

The chief juryman waved his hand and announced
neither acquittal nor condemnation, but the disagreement
of the jury  ten being for acquittal,
two for condemnation.  There was a general murmur.
The Judge smiled broadly ; counsel, witnesses
and public joined in a violent altercation, whilst
the prisoner at the bar, amidst repeated thanks
and protestations of affection for New York, was
led away amidst dense enthusiastic throngs to await
a new trial.

: >lc il ifs >|c

The next morning Gotham received another shock.
The Count had died in the night; possibly stricken
down by heart disease ; but more probably by his
first violent and sustained effort at telling the truth.
He left this assumed will :

I go to join the sausage-maker. Gotham, farewell
! I leave to the New York Central Park Museum
my trunk, containing the faithful toys of m} youth.
I bequeath these cherished souvenirs to budding
America, begging it, every time it looks upon them,
to aspire, to reflect, to emulate, to remember.
Gotham, farewell ! The end of this trial has brought

repose, repose has brought back the old ambition 
the love of adventure is still so strong in mc,
that to make the acquaintance of a new world, I
quit this one with pleasure. Alas ! no nobleman
dies in cell 16 of the Tombs, but a simple mortal,
known to the world as the Baron, Count de Marcie
and d'Orbach, but best to himself as the Barber of
Mayence."

There is little left to tell to finish this history.
New York, even the civilized world, wept the sudden
quenching of a bright light, and never ceased reiterating
-what might have been. But, however
much other metropolises may wail and refuse to
be comforted, Gotham may still take heart : she
cherishes innumerable noblemen in other forms
and guises ; perhaps with less classic memories, but
with stronger digestions, colder hearts, and no less
authentic titles.

Lucy Chromo has Avon; Adam will never give up
the glue business, but has compromised by driving
his carts down every Avenue excepting the Fifth,
Flora married Pastor, and was thrown into, not a
convulsion, but a marquisate, five days after the
wedding; legitimate heritage early assumed by her
honourable spouse. Every noah and then she threatens
her husband to leave him to marry Baron

d' Alfred!, still the unique object of her affections 
best man at her wedding, best friend of her heart.
Professor Protoplasm and Miss Chances-Cressy are
still but betrothed. The Chromo-Literary Society
foes on much the same as ever, and at the last
meeting brought up the origin of cats. The Professor
shone.

And Arundel ? He never recovered the shock he
had received on the quay, when Florestan told him
the result of his victory. He fell ill, and was taken
to his old hydropathic establishment, where he
made a will, and left everything he possessed to
Enilda. The great trial ended, in a moment of
enthusiasm , still attached to water, he jumped into
the river, and his body was recovered, but too late ;
life was extinct. Enilda in vain refused the fortune ;
but as it was left, not to her, but to her children if
she ever had any, and after that to Florestan and
his heirs, there seemed no way of getting rid of
the money, which, by some peculiar destiny, was
bound to be her inheritance. Charlotte Corday
seemed to stow voucher, although she never grew
whiter; while Fraulein Marx respectably married
Ricard, and went to Australia to build up a new home,
a new house, and a new reputation.

And Florestan ?

There was a quiet wedding in Grace Church

one morning in early January. Dr. Grandson
gave away the bride, and Enilda Rozen took
Ythan Florestan for better or worse. When her
husband gave her his first kiss, Httle Cyril came up
timidly :

"Here is a rose," he said, "a white rose for my
new mamma!" Then they walked towards the
sacristy to sign the moral doomsday book.

Adam Chromo and Professor Protoplasm wrote
their names as witnesses, in a flourishing hand ; then
one by one the party left the church.

That night Florestan and his young wife arm-in-arm
stood in the open doorway of the old house
in Tenth Street, looking at the bright crescent
wdjch glittered in a pale semicircle in the starlit
sky.

"Enilda?"

"Yes, darling."

Shall I tell you something which will make you
happy?"

That you love me ? "

Yes, always that, but  something else. Perhaps
our prayers have been answered."

Ythan, what can you mean ? "

Shall I tell you ? No ; read for yourself," and
leaning on his strong breast she read a paragraph ina
London newspaper, which brought a look of perfect

happiness into lier eyes. Only a simple notice of
four lines, and yet it said volumes :

The Lady Mildred Claremont has given birth
to a son, born at Allison House. Mr. Claremont is
hourly expected in town. Mother and child are
doing well."
