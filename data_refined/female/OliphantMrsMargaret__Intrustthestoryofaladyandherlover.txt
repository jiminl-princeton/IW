FATHER AND DAUGHTER.

My dear, the case is as plain as noonday ; you must
give this man up.'

'The case is not plain to me, father  at least, not
in your sense.'

Anne, you are very positive and self-opinionated,
but you cannot  it is not possible  set up your
judgment against mine on such a point. You, an
inexperienced, prejudiced girl, a rustic with no
knowledge of the world ! What do you know about
the man ? Oh, I allow he is well enough to look at ;
he has had the usual amount of education, and so

VOL. I. B

forth ; but what do you hnoiv about him ? that is
what I ask'

Not much, father,' said Anne, steadily ; 'but I
know Aim.'

Stuff ! you, a girl not much over twenty, know
a man ! Does he tell you, do you suppose, all the
adventures of his life ? Does he confess his sins to
you ? A young fellow that has been trained at a
public school, that has been at the university, that
has knocked about the world is he going to confide
all that to you ? He would be unworthy the name
of gentleman if he did.'

Would he not be more unworthy the name of
gentleman if he had done things which he could not
confide to me ? ' said Anne ; then reddening suddenly,
she added, ' And even if it were so, father, if in those
days he had done things unfit for my ears, let him be
silent ; I will not ask any questions : I know what he
is now.'

Oh, stuff, I tell you ! stuff and nonsense, child !
You know what he is now ! Yes, what he is when
his best coat is on, when he is going to church with

this hymn-book in his pocket and you on his arm ;
that is a very edifying aspect of him ; but if you think
that is all, or nearly all '

Anne was silent. It was not that she was convinced,
but that her indignation took words from her.
She could not make any reply to such calumnies ;
and this was troublesome to her father, who preferred
an argument to a distinct and unsupported statement.
He looked at her for a moment, baffled, feeling himself
cut short in the fill flow of utterance  then
picked up the thread again, and resumed ;

 You would be a fool to trust in any man in that
unguarded way: and above all in a lawyer. They
are all rogues ; it is in them. When did you ever
hear a good word spoken for that class of men ? I
will not consent to any such nonsense : and if you act
without my consent, you know the consequence. I
will not give your mother's money to maintain in
luxury a man who is  who will be  never mind ! You
shall not have it. I will give it to Rose, as I have
the power.'

You would not be so unjust,' said Anne.
n 2

Unjust ! I will do it if you defy me in this
way. Rose lias always been a better child to me than
you have been ; and she shall have the money if you
don't mind.'

Whoever had looked at Anne Montfort then
would not have given much for the chance of her
submission. She said nothing, but her upper lip
shut down upon the lower with an unrelenting, immovable
determination. She would not even add a
word to her protest against the possibility of the
injustice with which she had been threatened. She
was too proud to repeat herself; she stood still, unbending,
betraying no impatience, ready to receive
with calmness everything that might be said to hei-but
firm as the house upon its foundations, or the
hills that are called everlasting. Her father knew
something of the character of his eldest child ; he
knew very well that no small argument would move
her, but perhaps he was not aware how far beyond his
power she was. He looked at her, however, with a
passionate annoyance very different from her calm,
and with something vindictive and almost spiteful in

his reddish-grey eyes. Most likely he had felt himself
dashed against the wall of lier strong will before
now, and had been exasperated by the calm force of
opposition which he could make no head against.

You hear what I say,' he repeated roughly ; ' if
you insist, I shall exercise the right your mother gave
me ; I shall alter my will : and the fortune which is
no doubt your chief attraction in this man's eyes
the fortune he has been calculating upon  I will give
to Eose. You hear what I say ? '

Yes,' said Anne. She bowed her head gravely ;
no doubt that she understood him, and equally no
doubt that what he said had moved her as much asa
shower of rain might have done, and that she
was fully determined to take her own way.

On your own head be it then,' he cried.

She bowed again, and after waiting for a moment
to see if he had anything further to say to her, went
quietly out of the room. It was in the library of a
country house that this interview had taken place 
the commonplace business room of a country gentleman
of no very great pretensions. I've walls were lined

with bookcases in which there was a tolerable
collection of books, but set they did not tell for
much in the place. They were furniture like the
curtains, which were rather shabby, and the old
Turkey carpet  most respectable furniture, yet a
little neglected, wanting renewal. Mr. Montfort's
writing-table was laden with papers ; he had plenty
of business to transact, though not of a strictly
intellectual kind. He was an old man, still handsome
in his age, with picturesque snow-white hair in
masses, clearly-cut, fine features, and keen eyes of
that reddish hazel which betokens temper. Those
eyes constantly burned under the somewhat projecting
eyebrows. They threw a sort of angry lurid
light on his face. The name of the house was
Mount ; it had been in the montfort family for many
generations ; but it was not a beautiful and dignified
house any more than he was a fine old English
gentleman. Both the place and the man had traditionary
rights to popular respect, but neither mannor
place had enforced this claim by any individual
beauty or excellence. There was no doubt as to

the right of the Mountains to be ranked among the
gentry of the district, as good as the best, in so far
that the family had been settled there for centuries ;
but they were of that curiously commonplace strain
which is prevalent enough among the smaller gentry,
without any splendour of wealth to dazzle the
beholder, and which rouses in the mind of the
spectator a wonder as to what it is that makes the
squire superior to his neighbours. The Montfort
from father to son had got on through the world
without any particular harm or good, uninteresting,
ordinary people, respectable enough, yet not even
very respectable. They were not rich, they were notable
; they had nothing in themselves to distinguish
them from the rest of the world ; yet wherever the
name of ]Montfort appeared, throughout all the
southern counties at least, the claims of its possessor
to gentility were founded on his relationship to the
Mountfords of Mount. Most curious of all the
triumphs of the aristocratical principle ! Or rather
perhaps it is the more human principle of continuance
which is the foundation of this prejudice to

which we are all more or less subject. A family
which has lasted, which has had obstinacy enough
to cling to its bit of soil, to its old house, must have
something in it worth respect. This principle, however,
tells in favour of the respectable shopkeeper
quite as much as the squire, but it does not tell in
the same way. The Mountfords felt themselves of
an entirely different order from the shopkeeper 
why, heaven knows I but their estimate was accepted
by all the world.

Mount had the distinction of being entailed ; it
was not a large estate nor a valuable one, and it had
been deeply mortgaged when the present ]mr. ]Mount-ford,
St. John by name, came of age. But he had
married an heiress, who had liberated his acres and
added greatly to his social importance. The first Mrs.
Montfort had died early, leaving only one daughter,
and at the same time her entire fortune in the hands
of her husband, to do with it what he pleased. These
were the days when public opinion was very unanimous
as to the impropriety and unnecessarily of female
rights of any kind, and everybody applauded Mrs.

Moimtford for resisting all conditions, and putting
herself and her child unreservedly in her husband's
hands. He had re-married two years after her
death, but unfortunately had succeeded in obtaining
only another girl from unpropitious fate. His first
wife's daughter was Anne, universally considered as
the natural heiress of the considerable fortune which,
after clearing the estate, had remained of her
mothers money, and which her father had kept
scrupulously 'in a napkin,' like the churl in the
parable, neither increasing nor diminishing the
store. The other daughter was Rose. Such was
the household at Mount in the days when this
history begins. The reigning Mrs. montfort was
a good sort of easy woman who did not count for
much. She was one of the Dodington of Carrisford
a ' very good family ' of the same class as the
Mountfords. Nothing could be better than the
connections on both sides-or duller. But the girls
were different. It is very hard to say why the girls
should have been different  perhaps because the
present new wave of life has distinctly affected the

girls more than any other class of society. At all
events, the point was indisputable. Anne perhaps
might have taken after her mother, who was of an
entirely new stock, not a kind which had ever before
been ingrafted on the steady-going family tree. She
had come out of a race partly mercantile, partly
diplomatic ; her grandfather had been Spanish ; it
was even suspected that one of her ancestors had
been a Jew. All kinds of out-of-the-way sources
had furnished the blood which had been destined to
mix with the slow current in the Montfort veins ;
and probably Anne had inherited certain bizarre
qualities from this jumble. But Rose had no such
mixed antecedents. There was not a drop of blood
in her veins that did not belong to the county, and
it was difficult to see how she could have ' taken
after ' her sister Anne, as was sometimes suggested,
in respect to peculiarities which had come to Anne
from her mother ; but if she did not take after
Anne, who did she take after, as IVIrs. Montfort
often demanded ?

Rose was now eighteen and Anne just over .

They were considered in the neighbourhood
to be attractive girls. A household possessing
two such daughters is naturally supposed to have all
the elements of brightness within it ; and perhaps if
there had been brothers the girls would have taken
their natural place as harmonises and peacemakers.
But there were no* brothers, and the girls embodied
all the confusing and disturbing influences natural to
boys in their own persons, with certain difficulties
appropriate to their natural character. It is true
they did not get into scrapes or into debt ; they
were not expelled from school or ' sent down * from
College. Duns did not follow them to the paternal
door, or roistering companions break the family
peace. But yet Anne and Rose contrived to give as
much trouble to Mr. and ]Mrs. Montfort as if they
had been Jack and Tom. These good people had
lived for about a dozen years in their rural mansion
like the cabbages in the kitchen garden. Nothing
had disturbed them. There had been no call
upon their reasoning faculties, no strain upon
their affections : everything had gone on quite

tranquilly and comfortably, with that quiet persistence
of well-being which makes trouble seem
impossible. They had even said to themselves with
sighs, that to have only girls was after all good for
something. They could not be tormented as others
were, or even as the rector, one of whose boys had
gone ' to the bad.' The thing which had been was
that which should be. The shocks, the discoveries,
the commotions, which the restless elements involved
in male youth bring with them, could not trouble
their quiet existence. So they consoled themselves,
although not without a sigh.

Alas, good people I they had reckoned without
their girls. The first storm that arose in the house
was when Anne suddenly discovered that her governess
never detected her false notes when she played,
and passed the mistakes which she made, on purpose
to test her, in her grammar. ' I want someone who
can teach me,' the girl said. She was only fifteen,
but she had already made a great deal more use of
that pernicious faculty of reading which works so
much mischief in the world than Mrs. Montfort

approved. Someone who could teach her ! That
meant a lady at seventy-five or a hundred pounds a
year, instead of thirty-five, which was what they had
hitherto given, Mrs. Montfort nearly cried over
this most unreasonable demand. Miss Confessor
was very nice. She was of a family which had seen
better days, and she was fully conscious of her good
fortune in having gained an entry into a county
family. After all, what did it matter about false
notes or mistakes in grammar ? It was a ladylike
person that was everything. But when Rose too
declared in her little treble that she wanted somebody
who could teach her. Miss Confessor had to
go ; and the troubles that followed ! To do them
justice, the Squire and his wife did their very best
to satisfy these unreasonable young people. They
got a German governess with all kinds of certificates,
who taught Rose to say 'pon hour;' they got a
French lady, who commended herself to the best
feelings of Mrs. Montfort's nature by making her
up the sweetest cap, but who taught the girls that
Charles I. was all but rescued from the Scaffold by

the generous exertions of a Gascon gentleman of the
name of D'Artagnan and three friends who were
devoted to him. Mrs. Montfort herself was much
pleased with this information, but Anne and her
father were of a different opinion. However, it
would be too long to follow them minutely through
all these troubles. At seventeen Anne wanted Greek
and to ' go in for ' examinations  which gave a still
more complete blow to the prejudices of the house.
The same as a young man ! ' It was improper in
the highest degree, almost wicked ; Mrs. Montfort
did not like to think of it. It seemed to her, as to
some of our ablest critics, that nothing but illicit
longings after evil could make a girl wish to pass
examinations and acquire knowledge. She must
want to read the naughty books which are written
in Greek and Latin, and which deprave the minds
of young men, the good woman thought. As for
the certificates and honours, they might be all very-well
for the governesses of whom !Mrs. Montfort
had such melancholy experience ; but a young lady
of a county family, what did she want with them ?

They would be things to be ashamed, not proud of.
And on this point Anne was vanquished. She was
allowed to learn Greek with many forebodings, but
not to be examined in her knowledge. However,
this decision was chiefly intended to prevent Rose
from following her sister, as she always did ; for to
refuse Grierson to Rose would have been more difficult
than to neglect Anne's entreaties. For, though
Anne was the eldest sister, it was Rose who was the
princess royal and reigned over the whole demesne.

This desire of the higher education on the part
of Rose, who still said ' pon hour,' and was not at
all certain that two and two always make four,
would have been enough to keep the house in commotion
if there had not occurred just then one of
the family troubles appropriate to girls after so
many that could not be called feminine. It has
already been said that the rector of the parish had
a son who had ' gone to the bad.' He had two
other sons, rocks ahead for the young ladies at
Mount. Indeed these two young men were such
obvious dangers that Mrs. Mount ford had taken

precautions against them while Rose was still in
her cradle. One was a curate, his father's probable
successor ; but as the living was in Mr. Montfort's
hands, and it was always possible that someone else
might be preferred to Charley, some Montfort
connection who had a nearer claim, that prospect
did not count for much. The other was nothing at
all, a young man at Oxford, not yet launched upon
life. But fortunately these young men, though very
familiar in the house, were not handsome nor
dangerously attractive, and this peril is one which
must always be encountered in the country, even by
people of much higher pretensions than the Mountfords.
The first trouble, however, did not come
from this ob"'ious quarter, though it came through
there. It was not one of the Ashleyss ; but it was a
person still less satisfactory. One of the curate's
friends arrived suddenly on a visit in the late
summer  a young Mr. Douglas, a barrister, which
sounds well enough ; but not one of the Douglass
who have ever been heard of. They did not find this
out for some time, imagining fondly that he belonged,

at a distance perhaps, to the Morton family,
or to the house of Queensberry, or at least to
Douglasseses in Scotland, of whom it could be said
that they were of Lancashire or Selkirkshire or
some other county. Indeed, it was not until the
whole household was thrown into commotion by
a morning call from Mr. Douglas, who asked for
Mr. MouuLford, and boldly demanded from him the
hand of Anne, that it burst upon them that he was
a Douglas of nowhere at all. He had been very
well educated, and he was at the bar ; but when he
was asked what branch of the Douglasseses lie belonged
to, he answered ' None,' with a smile. ' I have
no relations,' he said. Relations can be dispensed
with. There is no harm in being without them ;
but a family was indispensable, and he belonged to
nobody. It was just like Anne, however, not to
care. She did not in the least care, nor did she see
any harm in her lover's countless condition. And
when ]Mr. Nlountford politely declined the honour of
an alliance with this Mr. Douglas of nowhere at all,
she did not hesitate to say that she entirely .
I. c

> 

agreed with her father. This was the state in which
things were at the time of the interview I have
recorded. Mr. Montfort was determined, and so
was his daughter. This struggle of wills had taken
place before, but never before had it gone so far.
In former cases Anne had given in, or she had been
given in to, the one as much as the other. Jut now
there was no yielding on one side or the other. The
father had declared himself inexorable ; the daughter
had said little, but her countenance had said much.
And the threat with which he wound up had introduced
an entirely new element into the discussion.
What was to come of it ? But that was what at
this moment nobody could venture to say.

CHAPTER U.

THE Best OF THE FAMILY.

The old house of Mount was a commodious but
ugly house. It was not even so old as it ought to
have been. Only in one corner were there any
picturesque remains of antiquity, and that was in
the back of the house, and did not show. The only
thing in its favour was that it had once been a much
larger place than it was now, and a detached bit of
lime avenue  very fine trees, forming in the summer
two lovely walls of tender shade  was supposed in
the traditions of the place to indicate where once
the chief entrance and the best part of the mansion
had been. At the foot of the terrace on which
these trees stood, and at a considerably lower
altitude, was the flower-garden, very formally laid
out, and lying along the side of the house, which

was of dull brick with very flat windows, and might
almost have been a factory, so uninteresting was it ;
but the lawns that spread around were green and
smooth as velvet, and the park, though not large,
was full of fine trees. Mr. Montfort's room was in
the back of the house, and Anne had to go from one
end to another to reach the common morning room
of the family, which was the hall. This had been
nothing but a mere passage in former days, though
it was square and not badly proportioned ; but the
modern taste for antiquity had worked a great
change in this once commonplace vestibule. It had
been furnished with those remains which are always
to be found about an old house, relics of past
generations, curtains which had been rejected as too
dingy for wear a hundred years ago, but now were
found to be the perfection of tone and taste  old
folding screens, and chairs and tables dismissed as
too clumsy or too old-fashioned for the sitting rooms
of the family. All these together made a room which
strangers called picturesque, but which old neighbours
regarded with contempt, as a thing of shreds

and patches. There was but one huge window
reaching from the ceiling almost to the floor, and an
equally large mantelpiece almost matching the
window and opposite to it. The large round table
before the fire was covered with an old Indian shawl
carefully darned and mended for this use  a use
which had revolted all the old ladies in the county 
and with books, magazines, and newspapers, carefully
arranged by old Saymore, the butler, in a kind of
pattern ; for Saymore followed his young ladies, and
took a great interest in everything that was artistic,
A work-table in one corner overflowed with rebels ;
in another stood an easel. The place was full of the
occupations and fancies of the two girls who had
fashioned it into its present shape. While Anne
was having the conversation with her father which
has been recorded, Mrs. Montfort and Eose were
pursuing their different employments in this room.
Mrs. Montfort was a contradiction to everything
about her. She wore ribbons of the most pronounced
brightness, dresses of the old gay colours; and did
worsted work. She was a round plump woman,

with rosy cheeks and a smiling mouth ; but she was
not quite so innocent and easy as her looks indicated.
She could stand very fast indeed where any point of
interest was concerned  and she was doubly immovable
in consequence of the fact that her interests
were not her own but those of Eose, and therefore
she could not be made to feel guilty in respect to
them. She had a little table of her own in the
midst of all the properties  which she called rubbish
accumulated by the girls, and there pursued her
placid way week after seek and year after year,
working, as if she had been born a century earlier,
groups of roses and geraniums for cushions and
footstools, and strips of many coloured work for
curtains and rugs. Had she been permitted to have
her will, the house would have been furnished with
these from garret to basement ; but as Rose was
artistic,' poor Mrs. montfort's Berlin wools were
rarely made any use of. They were given away as
presents, and disposed of at bazaars. There was a
closet in her own room which was full of them, and
a happy woman was she when any girl of her acquaintance

married, or a fancy fair was announced
.for any charitable object, which reduced her stores.
A work basket full of the most brilliant wools in the
tidiest bundles, a German pattern printed in squares,
a little pile of tradesmen's books in red covers, and
a small brown basket full of keys, were the signs of
her little settlement in the hall. These possessions
stood upon a small table with three legs, decorated
with a broad band of Mrs. Montfort's work. She
had said boldly that if she were not permitted to
put her own work upon her own table, she did not
know what the world would come to. And upon
hearing this protest Anne had interfered. Anne
was the only person who ever interfered to save her
stepmother from the tyranny exercised over herby
her own child ; but Mrs. Montfort was not
grateful enough to return this service by taking
Anne's part.

Rose was the presiding spirit of the hall. Though
she did not originate anything, but followed her
sister's lead, yet she carried out all the suggestions
that ever glanced across the surface of Anne's mind

with an energy which often ended in making the
elder sister somewhat ashamed of lier initiative.
Anne's fancies become stereotyped in Rose's execution,
and nothing but a new idea from the elder
changed the current of the younger girl's enthusiasm.
When Anne took to ornamental design, Rose painted
all the panels of the doors and window shutters, and
even had begun a pattern of sunflowers round the
drawing-room (which had been newly decorated with
a dado and three kinds of wall-papers), when Anne
fortunately took to sketching from nature, and saved
the walls by directing her sister's thoughts in another
direction. The easel remained a substantial proof
of these studies, but a new impulse had changed the
aspect of affairs. In the course of the sketching it
had been discovered that some of the cottages on the
estate were in the most wretched condition, and
Anne, with the instinct of a budding squire and
philanthropist united, had set to work upon plans
for new houses. The consequence of which was that
Rose, with compasses and rulers and a box of freshly-cut
pencils, was deep in the question of sculleries

and wash-houses!, marking all the measurements
upon the plan, with her whole heart in the work.

Anne is a long time with papa,' said Mrs,
longford ; ' I suppose she is trying to talk him
over ; she might just as well try to move the house.
You girls never will understand that it is of no use
arguing with papa.'

One never can help thinking that reason must
prevail,' said Rose, without raising her head, ' at the
end.'

Reason ! ' said Mrs. Montfort, lifting her hands
and her eyebrows ; ' but, even if it were always
reason, what would that matter ? As for Anne, she
has a great deal too much self-confidence ; she
always thinks she is right.'

And so she is  almost always,' said Rose, very
busy with her measuring. ' Do you happen to remember,
mamma, whether it is ninety feet or a
hundred that the pigsty must be off the house ? '

What should I know about piastres ? I am
sure I often wonder papa takes all the trouble he
does when you are both so headstrong. Fortunately

for him lie has me to talk to where soil are concerned
; but Anne ! oh, here she is  don't say

anything, she may not like to have it talked about.
So here you are at last, Anne ; we thought you were
never coming. But I wish I had someone to do my
work for me when I am busy about something else,
as Eose does for you. She never takes so much
trouble on my account.'

It is not her work,' said Eose, offended, ' it is
my own. Mayn't I have something now and then
that is my own ? How many yards, Anne, do you
remember, must the pigsty be off the house ? '

Anne did not remember this important piece of
knowledge. ' But,' she said, ' it is in that book of
specifications. It is dry to read, but it is a very
good book ; you should have it on the table to refer
to. You have made the living room too large in
comparison with the rest of the house.'

Because they are poor,' said Eose, indignantly,
is that to say that they are to have nothing pretty
in their lives ? '

But there must be a good scullery,' said Anne.

She stood with a very grave face behind her sister,
looking over her shoulder at the drawings spread out
on the table. Whether it was the importance of the
scullery, or of the other matters concerning her own
happiness which she had in her head, it is certain
that Anne's countenance was very serious. The very
tone of her voice proved to those who knew her so
well that her mood was graver than usual. At other
times the importance of the scullery would have
brought a tone of laughter, an accent of fun into her
voice ; but her gravity was now quite real and unbroken
by any lighter sentiment. She was taller
than her sister, and of a different order altogether.
Anne was rather pale than otherwise, with but a
slight evanescent colour now and then ; her features
good, her face oval, her eyes dark grey, large and
lucid, and with long eyelashes curling upwards. But
Rose, though she had all that beauty de diable which
is the privilege of youth, was, like her mother, round
and rosy, though her pretty little face and figure had
not the solidity, nor her complexion the set and
rigid tone which placid middle age acquires. The

one face over the other contrasted pleasantly ; the
elder serious, as if nothing in heaven or earth could
ever make her smile again ; the younger bent with
momentary gravity and importance over her work.
But they had no air of belonging to each other.
Nothing but an accident could have linked together
two beings so little resembling. The accident was
Mr. Montfort, whom neither of them was at all
like. They were not Mountfords at all, as everybody
in the neighbourhood allowed. They took
after their mothers, not the one and indivisible head
of the family ; but that did not really matter, for
these two girls, like their mothers, were no more
than accidents in the house.

The ancient estate was entailed, and knew
nothing of such slight things as girls. When their
father died they would have to give up Mount and
go away from it. It was true that there still would
be a great deal of land in the county belonging to
one of them at least, for Mr. Montfort had not
been able to resist the temptation of buying and
enlarging his estate at the time when he married his

first wife, and thought of no such misfortune as that
of leaving only a couple of girls behind him. A long
life and boys to succeed him were as certainties in
his thoughts when he bought all the lands about
Sherwood and the estate of Lower Clifford. There
they lay now, embracing Mount on every side, Mount
which must go to Heathcote Montfort, the head of
the other family. It was grievous, but it could not
be helped. And the girls were not Mountfords,
either the one or the other. They betrayed, shall we
say, an inherent resentment against the law of entail
and all its harsh consequences, by resembling their
mothers, and declining to be like the race which thus
callously cast them forth.

Mrs. Montfort looked at them with very watchful
eyes. She knew what it was which had made her
husband send for his eldest daughter into his study
after breakfast. It was a circumstance which often
galled Anne, a high-spirited girl, that her stepmother
should be in the secret of all her personal concerns ;
but still man and wife are one, and it could not be
helped. This fact, however, that everything was

known about her-whether she would or not, shut her
lips and her heart. Why should she be confidential
and open herself to their inspection when they knew
it all beforehand without her ? This stopped all
inclination to confide, and had its effect, no doubt,
as all repression has, on Anne's character. Her heart
was in a turmoil now, aching with anger and annoyance,
and disappointment, and a sense of wrong.
But the only effect of this was to make her more
serious than ever. In such a mood to win a smile from
her, to strike her sense of humour, which was lively,
or to touch her heart, which was tender, was to open
the floodgates, and the girl resented and avoided this
risk with all the force of her nature. And, truth to
tell, there was little power, either in Mrs. Montfort
or her daughter, to undo the bonds with which Anne
had bound herself. It was seldom that they appealed
to her feelings, and when they made her laugh it was
not in sympathy, but derision an unamiable and
unsatisfactory kind of laughter. Therefore it
happened now that they knew she was in trouble,
and watched her keenly to see the traces of it ; and

she knew they knew, and sternly repressed any
symptom by which they might divine how much
moved she was.

You build your cottages your way,' cried Rose,
and I will build mine in mine. Papa will let me
have my choice as well as you, and just see which will
be liked best.

If Ileathcote should have to be consulted,' said
Anne, ' it will be the cheapest that he will like
best.

Anne ! I shouldn't have thought that even you
could be so unfeeling. To remind us that dear
papa  ' cried Mrs. Montfort ; ' dear papa ! Do
not speak of his life in that indifferent way, at least
before Eose.'

Oh, it would not matter,' said Eose, calmly,
whatever happens ; for they are for the Milford
houses on our very own land. Heathcote hasn't anything
to do with them.'

Anne might say, " Nor you either," my Elsie,'
?aid her mother ; ' for everybody knows that you are
cat off out of it in every way. Oh, I don't find any

fault. I knew it when I married, and sou have
known it all your life. It is rather hard, however,
everything turning out against us, you and me, my
pet ; part of the property going away altogether to a
distant cousin, and the rest all tied up because one of
you is to be made an eldest son.'

Mamma ! ' said Eose, petulantly, giving a quick
glance up at her mother, and shrugging her shoulders
with the superiority of youth, as who would say,
Why speak of things you don't understand ? Then
she closed her compasses and put down her pencil.
Are we to have a game this afternoon ? ' she
said ; ' I mean, Anne, are you going to play ?
Charley and Willie are sure to come, but if you
go off as usual, it will be no good, for three can't
play.'

The colour came in a flood over Anne's pale face.
]Mamma plays better than I do,' she said. ' I have
a headache. I don't think I shall do anything this
afternoon.'

Will Mr. Douijjlas have a headache too ? ' said
Ivose ; ' he generally has when you have. It is not

much fun,' she added, with a little virtuous indignation,
' for Charley and Willie to play with mamma.'

Mrs. Montfort showed no resentment at this
frank speech. ' No,' she said, ' it is not much fun
for Charley and Willie. I don't think it has been
much fun for them since Mr. Douglas came. Anne
likes his talk ; he is a very fine talker. It is more
interesting to listen to him than to play.'

Sometimes it is,' said Anne gravely, though
with another blush ; and then the two others
laughed.

My dear, you bring it on yourself ; if we are not
to have your confidence, we must have our laugh.
We have eyes in our head as well as other people 
or, at least, I have eyes in my head,' said the mother.
Anne could not but acknowledge that there was reason
in what she said, but it was not said in a way to
soften the wounded and angry girl.

I do not ask you not to laugh,' she said.

You look more like crying,' said Eose ; and she
got up and threw her arms suddenly about her sister
being an impulsive little person whose sympathies

VOL. I. D

were not to be calculated upon. ' What is it, dear ?
tell 77 e,' she cried, with her soft lips upon her sister's
cheek.

Anne's heart swelled as if it would burst out of
her breast. There are states of mind in which
everything can be borne but sympathy. The gates
so hastily rolled to and pushed close began to open.
The tears came to her eyes. But then she remembered
that the threat her father had made was not one to
be confided to them.

Never mind. I have been talking to my father,
and he and I don't see things in the same light. We
don't always  one can't help that,' said Anne, in a
subdued voice.

Come up to my room,' said Eose in her ear.
Never mid mamma  oh, come up to my room,
Anne darling, and tell me all about it ! I never was
anyone's confidant before.'

But this was not a process which Anne, shy with
a fervour of feeling more profound than Rose could
understand, or she herself express, felt at all disposed
to go through. She put her younger sister gently

aside, and brought her plans too to the table. ' We
had better settle about the piastres,' she said, with a
little relaxation of her gravity. She laughed in spite
of herself. ' It is a safe subject. Show me, Rosie,
what you have done.'

Rose was still fresh to this pursuit, and easily
recalled to it, so she produced her drawings with
little hesitation, and after a while forgot the more
interesting matter. They sat with their heads
together over the plans, while Mrs. Montfort
pursued her worsted work. A moralist might have
found in the innocent-seeming group all that inscrutableness
of human nature which it is so easy to
remark and so impossible to fathom. Rose, it was
true, had not much in her little mind except the
cottages, and the hope of producing a plan which
should be approved as the best, having in her heart
a childish desire to surpass Anne, which by no
means diminished her faithful allegiance to her as
the origin of all impulses and setter of every fashion.
But Anne's heart, underneath the fresh crispness of
her muslin dress, and the apparent interest with

D 2

which she pursued her work, and discussed her
sculleries, was beating high with much confused and
painful emotion. Indignation and a sense of wrong,
mingled with a certain contempt even for the threat
which had wounded her as an empty menace, never
to be carried out  a false and fictitious weapon meant
for no end but that of giving her pain ; and, on the
other hand, the disappointment of her hopes, and a
certainty of severance from the love which had been
a revelation to her of so much in heaven and earth
of which she was unaware before  filled her being.
She would not give him up, but she would be parted
from him. He would go away, and any intercourse
they might hereafter keep up must be maintained in
resistance to the authority under which she had
lived all her life. Thus what she had supposed to
be the crown and glory of existence was summarily
turned into bitterness and wrong. She was turning
it over and over in her mind, while she sat there
steadily comparing her measurements with those of
her sister, and wondering how long she must go on
with this in order to confound her stepmother's

suspicions, and prove that she was neither discouraged
nor rendered unhappy by what had happened.
Naturally, in her inexperience, Anne gave great importance
to this feat of baffling her stepmother's
observation, and looking 'just as usual ; ' and naturally,
also, she failed altogether in the attempt.
Mrs. longford was an experienced woman. She
knew what it meant when a girl looked too much as
if nothing had happened. And she watched with
great vigilance, partly by simple instinct, partly
with a slight sense of gratification, that the elder
daughter, who was so much more important than her
own child, should feel that she was mortal. It was
not any active malevolence that was in Mrs. Mount-ford's
mind. She would have been horrified had it
been suggested to her that she wished Anne any
harm. She wished her no harm ; but only that she
might feel after all that life was not one triumph
and scene of unruffled success and blessedness 
which IS the best moral discipline for everybody, as is
well known.

CHAPTER III.

THE ' GAME.'

The name of the parish in which Mount was the
principal house was Monitor, by some supposed to
be a corruption of INIount-ton, the village being-situated
on the side of a circular hill looking more
like a military mound than a natural object, which
gave the name alike to the property and the district.
Mount Hill, as it was called with unnecessary
amplification, was just outside the park gates, and at
its foot lay the Rectory, the nearest neighbouring
house with which the Mountfords could exchange
civilities. When one comes to think of it, the very
existence of such ecclesiastical houses close by the
mansions of the English gentry and nobility is a
standing menace and danger to that nobler and
more elevated class  now that the family living is

no longer a natural provision for a younger son. The
greatest grandee in the land has to receive the
clergyman's family as equals, whatever may be his
private opinion on the subject ; they are ladies and
gentlemen, however poor they may be, or little
eligible to be introduced into closer connection with
members of the aristocracy, titled or otherwise ; and,
as a matter of fact, they have to be so received,
whence great trouble sometimes arises, as everybody
knows. The young people at the Hall and the
parsonage grow up together, they meet continually,
and join in all each other's amusements, and if they
determine to spend their lives together afterwards,
notwithstanding all those social differences which
are politely ignored in society, until the moment
comes when they must be brought into prominence,
who can wonder at it ? The wonder is that on the
whole so little harm occurs. The young Ashleyss
were the nearest neighbours of the Montfort girls.
They called each other by their Christian names;
they furnished each other with most of their amusements.
Had the boys not been ready to their call

for any scheme of pleasure or use, the girls would
have felt themselves aggrieved. But if Charley or
Willie had fallen in love with Anne or Eose, the
whole social economy would have been shaken by it,
and no earthquake would have made a greater commotion.
Such catastrophes are constantly happening
to the confusion of one district after another allover
the country ; but who can do anything to prevent
it ? That it had not happened (openly) in the
present case was due to no exceptional philosophy or
precaution on any side. And the chance which had
made Mr. Cosmo Douglas speak first instead of his
friend, the curate, was in no way a fortunate one,
except in so far, indeed, that, though it produced
great pain and sorrow, it, at least, preserved peace
between the two families. The Rector was as much
offended, as indignant as Mr. Montfort could beat
the audacity of his son's friend. A stranger, a
chance visitor, an intruder in the parish, he, at least,
had no vested rights.

The facts of the case were as yet, however, but
imperfectly known. Douglas had not gone away,

though it was known that his interview with jNIr.
Montfort had not been a successful one ; but that
was no reason why the Ashleyss should not stroll upto
Mount on this summer afternoon, as was their very
general practice. There was always some business
to talk about something about the schools, or the
savings bank, or other parochial affairs ; and both
of them were well aware that without them ' a game '
was all but impossible.

Do you feel up to it, old fellow ? ' Willie said
to Charley, who was the curate. The elder brother
did not make any distinct reply. He said, ' There's
Douglas to be thought of,' with a somewhat lugubrious
glance behind him where that conquering
hero lay on the grass idly puffing his cigar.

Confound Douglas ! ' said the younger brother,
who was a secular person and free to speak his mind.
Charley Ashley replied only with a stifled sigh. He
might not himself have had the courage to lay his
curacy and his hopes at Anne's feet, at least for a
long time to come, but it was not to be expected
that he could look with pleasure on the man who

had rushed in where he feared to tread, his supplanter,
the Jacob who had pushed him out of his
path. But yet he could not help in a certain sense
admiring his friend's valour. He could not help
taikmg of it as they took their way more slowly
than usual across the park, when Douglas, with a
conscious laugh, which went sharply, like a needle,
through the poor curate's heart, declined to join
them, but begged they ' would not mind ' leaving
him behind.

When a fellow has the pluck to do it, things
generally go well with him,' Charley said.

The two brothers were very good friends. The
subject of Anne was one which had never been
discussed between them, but Willie Ashley knew by
instinct what were his brother's sentiments, and
Charley was conscious that he knew. The little
roughness with which the one thrust his arm into
the other's spoke of itself a whole volume of sympathy,
and they walked through the sunshine and
under the flickering shadows of the trees, slowly and
heavily, the curate with his head bent, and his

brown beard, of which he was as proud as was
becoming to a young clergyman, lying on his breast.
Pluck carries everything before it,' he said,
with a sigh. ' I never was one of your plucky
ones.'

If you call that pluck I ' cried the other, ' when
a fellow thinks of nothing but himself, and goes
straight before him, whatever happens.'

The curate pressed his brother's arm with tacit
thanks, but he sighed even more. ' All the same it
was a plucky thing to do,' he said.

The young men were seen approaching for a
long time before they reached the house. ' I wonder
what has happened,' said Eose ; * they walk as if they
were going to a funeral ; but I suppose I had better
go and see that everything is ready for the game.*
After all this was the important matter, and the
Ashleyss, though of no great consequence in themselves,
were at least the only young men in the
parish; and if the Woodheads came, as Rose expected,
it looked a poor sort of thing to have nomen.
What the game was I can scarcely pretend

"to say. It might be croquet, or it might be lawn
tennis. This is entirely a chronological question,
and one upon which, as the date of this commencement
is a little vague, I cannot take upon me to
decide. And just as Willie and Charley approached
slowly, in a solemn march, the familiar house to
which they had so often turned with steps and hearts
less weighted, the Woodheads appeared on the other
side.

I was sure they would come,' cried Rose ; ' here
are Grerty and Fanny.' These young ladies were
a clergyman's daughters, and might have paired off
most suitably with the Ashleyss and no harm done ;
but perverse humanity may be so far trusted as to
make sure that none of the four thought of any such
sensible arrangement.

As for Anne, a sigh of satisfaction and relief
came from her bosom, not like that deeper sigh
which breathed forth the curate's cares. As soon as
she had seen the game begun and all comfortable,
she would escape to her own business. Her heart beat
high with the thought of the meeting that awaited

her, and of the long, confiding, lover's talk, the
pouring out of all her cares into another heart which
was her own. Anne had not been accustomed to
much sympathy in her life. She had not wanted it
perhaps. She loved her little sister with her whole
heart ; but a high sense of honour had kept her, even
when a child, from confiding to Eose any of the
little jars and frets of which Rose's mother was the
chief cause ; and what other cares had Anne ? So
that the delight of saying everything that was in
her heart was as new to her as the love that made it
possible. And it was one of the elements of wondering
happiness that filled her whole being to find
out how many things she had to tell. She had
thought herself reserved, inexpensive, sometimes
even cold and heartless, when she beheld the endless
confidential chatter of other girls, and wondered
why it was that she had nothing to confide. But
now she was half dismayed and half transported to
discover how much she too had to say. The deep
waters of her heart seemed to flow over from that
secret place, and pour out in an irretrievable flood.

It seemed to herself that she kept them in with
difficulty even to other people now. She had so
much to tell him that she could scarcely help preluding
even to those who were indifferent, betraying
to them the great tide of utterance that was in her.
As a matter of fact, she did not at all betray herself ;
the Woodheads and the Ashleyss saw that Anne was
slightly flushed and feverish, justifying the complaint
she made of a headache, for the sake of which
she feared staying out in the sun ; and one of the
former, who was a medical young lady, accustomed
to manage all the lighter maladies of her father's
parish, immediately prescribed for the sufferer.

Don't stay out here,' Miss Fanny said ;  it is the
worst thing possible. Gro and lie down ; or, if you
don't like that, sit down in the shade and take a
quiet book. Have you got a novel ?  if it's not an
exciting one, that will do  but keep yourself perfectly
quiet and never mind us. Her pulse is just a
little excited  nothing to be alarmed about  if she
will but go and lie down.'

The others, especially the two young men, exchanged

furtive glances. Willie pressed Charley's
aim with a whisper, ' Keep it up, old fellow ! '
Poor cm-ate ! he looked piteously at the girl whom
he had not had the courage to try for. Would her
cheeks have taken that lovely flush, her eye got that
anxious, nervous brightness for him ? Was it all a
question of pluck, and who should be the first to
speak ? He watched her going back to the house,
across the flower garden, with his lips in an unconscious
foolish gape of self-renunciation and tender
pity and regret. But happily that rich brown
beard of his hid the imbecility of this pathetic
simple gaze. And then he turned with sober resolution
to the game. He cared for nothing any more
now that Anne had gone. But an Englishman
must play his game out whatever happens ; though
heaven and earth should melt away.

Nobody suspected her, nobody dreamt what
Anne was about to do. That she should do anything
that was not open and manifest entered into no
one's idea of her. She had always been mistress of
herself and all her ways, and had never quailed

before the face of man. Did she feel guilty now
when she thus appeared to accept the advice offered
to her  appeared to consent to take shelter from the
sun, and went back to the house to lie down, or take
a quiet book, as was recommended? Anne was a
great deal too much occupied with her own thoughts
and plans to feel any of those little guilts yet. She
was scarcely conscious of what she herself felt and
thought. She had to carry the report of the morning
to the other person, who was as much concerned
as she was in it ; to tell him everything, to know
what he had to say, to consult with him as to what
they were to do. With all this in her heart, a flood
of thought, rising and falling, like waves of the sea,
is it possible that she could think of what the others
would say, or even of the novel aspect of her subterfuge
and evasion ? She could think of nothing
about them, but of how to get free, to be delivered
from her companions. To see him was necessary,
indispensable. She had never permitted it to be
supposed that she would not see him, or suffered
anything to be drawn from her which could imply

an intention of giving him up. Her father had said
nothing on this subject. There had been neither
condition nor promise. But still it was no doubt
contrary to Anne's character, as it was to high
honors and sincerity, that she should allow it to be
supposed that she was returning to the house on
account of her headache, when her intention was to
go out another way and meet her lover. When she
thought of it afterwards the flush of shame which
came over her ran from head to foot ; but at the
present moment she was entirely unmoved by it.
The idea did not so much as cross the threshold of
her mind.

She went softly into the cool and silent house.
There was nobody visible in the long passages, nor
in the hall through which she passed, not consciously
going with any precaution, yet making little sound
with her light foot. Even Mr. Montfort was out ;
the doors stood open, the sunshine streamed in here
and there at a window making a bar of blazing
whiteness across the corridor or stair. Old Say-more
was in the open vestibule, full of plants and

TOL. I. E

flowers, into which the great door opened. He was
standing before a tall vase of white glass, almost as
high as himself, in which he was arranging with
great anxiety and interest a waving bouquet of tall
ferns and feathery branches. Old Saymore had a
soul for art, and the fancies of his young mistress
stood in place of all the canons and science of beauty
to his mind. He stood with his head on one side,
now and then walking a few steps backward to
consider the combination of his leaves like an artist
before a picture, pulling one forward, pushing one
back, pondering with the gravest countenance how
to prop up in the middle the waving plume of
sumach with which he intended to crown the edifice.
He was too much absorbed in his performance to
notice Anne, who for her part was too completely
preoccupied by hers to see him where he stood, embowered
in all that greenery, calculating and considering
with the most serious countenance as if the
weight of an empire was on his shoulders. As she
ran down the steps he heard her for the first time,
and turned round hurriedly, moved by the hope of

finding a critic and adviser. But his cry of ' ]Miss
Anne ! ' failed to reach her ear. Her heart was
beating high, her thoughts rushing at such a rapid
rate that they made a little atmosphere of sound
about her, and shut out all less ethereal appeals.

After the Ashleyss had left the Rectory, Mr.
Cosmo Douglas for his part raised himself from the
grass where he had lain so luxuriously puffing his
cigar He was more amused than distressed by the
confusion he had brought among them. Charley
Ashley was his friend, but the affection had been
chiefly on one side. It had been, as the other very
well knew, a distinction for Ashley, who was not
distinguished in any other way, to be known as the
friend of a personage so much more brilliant and
popular than himself. Douglas had been accustomed
to smile when he was asked by his admirers 'what
lie could see ' in the good fellow who was neither
clever nor gay, nor rich, nor witty, and who had,
indeed, no particular recommendation except his
goodness. It pleased him to attach to himself this
useful, faithful, humble friend, who was always

2

LIBRARY

ready to stand up for him, and never likely to bring
him into any scrape or trouble. And he had always
been ready, he thought, to do anything for Charley
to coach him for an examination, to write an essay
for him, to ' pull him through ' any of the crises of
a college career. But to go so far as to curb his
own fancy for a girl who pleased him because
Charley had set his affections in the same quarter,
was a thing entirely beyond Cosmo's perceptions of
the duties of friendship. And when he saw the
dismal looks of his friend  his heavy dropping back
upon the sympathy of Willie, his younger brother,
who had never hitherto been his confidant, and the
suppressed indignation towards himself of that
younger and always jealous companion, he was more
tickled than grieved by it. The idea that he could
find a serious rival in Ashley never entered his
thoughts  or, indeed, that anyone should pay the
slightest regard to poor Charley while he was by.
Douglas had, indeed, so much confidence in the
humility of his friend that he felt his own preference
of any thing or person to be a quite sufficient reason

whj Charley should give it up. ' He likes to give
in to me,' was what he had said on many previous
occasions ; and he was unable to understand how any
other affection could be more deeply rooted in
Ashley's bosom than that which was directed to
himself. Therefore he only smiled at what he supposed
a momentary petulance. Grood simple soul .
perhaps Douglas respected his friend more that he
was capable of being so badly ' hit.' But yet he
could scarcely realise the possibility of it. Charley
in love had not presented itself to him as a credible
idea. It made him laugh in spite of himself. And
as for interfering with Charley !  as if anyone
could suppose it possible that Charley was a man to
catch a lady's eye.

Cosmo's first visit had been at Christmas, when
all was new to him, and when the revelation of the
two girls at Mount, so full of life and movement
amid the gentle stagnation of the parish, had been
the most delightful surprise to the resigned visitor,
who had come as a matter of duty, determined to
endure anything, and make himself agreeable to

Charley's friends. ' You never told me what sort of
neighbours you had,' he had said almost with indignation.
' Neighbours ! I told you about the Mountfords
and the Woodheads, and Lord Meadowlands,
who is our great gun,' said Charley tranquilly. ' You
speak as if they were all the same  Mountfords and
Woodheads and Smiths and Jones  whereas Miss
Montfort would be remarked in any society,'
Douglas had said. He remembered afterwards that
Charley had looked at him for a moment before he
replied, and had grown red ; but all he had said was,
I didn't know that you thought much about girls.'
All this passed through Douglas's mind as he stood
looking after the two brothers, watching the mournfulness
of their march with an irrepressible sense of
the ludicrous. To see that victim of fate leaning on
Ins brother's arm, dropping now and then a melancholy
word or deep-heaved sigh, and walking
gloomily, as after a funeral, to the afternoon ' game,'
was a sight at which the most sympathetic looker-on
might have been excused for smiling. ' I didn't
know that you thought much about girls ! ' Was

there ever a more stupid remark ? And how was I
to know he thought much about girls ? Douglas
asked himself with another laugh. His conscience
was easily satisfied on this point. And he had comedown
at the beginning of the long vacation to see a
little more of the Ashleyss' neighbours. He could
not but feel that it must be a relief to them also to
see a conversable being, an alive and awake human
creature amidst those scenes of rural life.

But now how far things had gone ! Douglas had
been a month at the Rectory, and as his eyes followed
the two Ashleyss along the white sun-swept road and
away under the shadow of the park trees, the idea
came to him, with a curious sense of expansive and
enlarged being, that the masses of foliage sweeping
away towards the west, amid which the two solemn
wayfarers soon disappeared, would one day, in all
probability, be his own. ' No, by the bye, not that ;
that's the entailed part,' he said to himself; then
laughed again, this time partly in gentle self-ridicule,
partly in pleasure, and turned his face the other way,
towards Lower Lilford  for he had made himself

master of the whole particulars Facing this way,
and with the laugh still on his lips, he suddenly
found himself in the presence of the Eector, who had
come out by his own study window at the sight of
the solitary figure on the lawn. Douglas felt himself
taken in the act  though of what it would have
been hard to say. He grew red in spite of himself
under the gaze of the Rector's mild and dull eyes.

Have the boys left you alone ? I can't think
how they could be so rude,' Mr. Ashley said.

'Not rude at all, sir. It is I who am rude. I
was lazy, and promised to follow them when I had
finished my  novel.' Happily, he recollected intime
that he had been holding one in his hand. ' I
am going now,' he added.  I dare say I shall catch
them up before they get to the house.'

I was afraid they were leaving you to take care
of yourself  that is not our old-fashioned way,' said
the old clergyman. ' 1 wish you a pleasant walk.
It is a fine afternoon, but you will find the road
dusty. I advise you to go over the meadows and
round the lower way.'

That is just how I intended to go.'

Very sensible. The boys always take the highroad.
The other takes you round by the Beeches,
much the prettiest way ; but it is longer round, and
that is why they never use it. A pleasant walk to
you,' Mr. Ashley said, waving his hand as he went
back to the house.

Douglas laughed to himself as he took the path
through the meadows which Mr. Ashley had indicated.
The Rector had not as yet interested himself
much in what was goiu'- on, and the simplicity
with which he had suggested the way which the
lovers had chosen, and which led to their tryst ing-
place, amused the intruder still more. ' If he but
knew ! ' Douglas said to himself, transferring to the
old clergyman the thoughts that filled the mind of
his son, by a very natural heightening of his own importance.
And yet, to tell the truth, had Mr. Ashley
known, it would have been a great relief to his mind,
as releasing Charley from a great danger and the
parish from a possible convulsion. To know this,
however, might have lessened the extreme satisfaction

with which Douglas set out for the meeting.
He went slowly on across the green fields, all bright
in the sunshine, across the little stream, and up the
leafy woodland road that led to the Beeches, his
heart pleasantly agitated, his mind full of delightful
anticipations. Anne herself was sweet to him, and
his conquest of her flattered him in every particular.
Happiness, importance, wealth, an established place
in the world, were all coming to him, linked hand
in hand with the loves and joys which surrounded
the girl's own image. He had no fear of the consequences.
Remorseless fathers were not of his time.
Such mediaeval furniture had been cleared out of the
world. He expected nothing from this meeting but
acceptance, reconciliation, love, and happiness.

CHAPTEK IV.

VHDEU THE BEECHES.

The Beeches were a beautiful clump of trees on a
knoll in the middle of the park. They were
renowned through the county, and one of the glories
of Mount. When the family was absent  which
did not happen often  picnic parties were made upto
visit them. There was nothing like them in all
the country round. The soil was rich and heavy
round them with the shedding of their own leaves,
and when the sun got in through their big branches
and touched that brown carpet it shone like specks
of gold. Some of the branches were like trees in
themselves, and the great grey trunks like towers.
One of them had been called, from time immemorial,
the lover's tree. It was scrawled over with initials,
some of them half a century old, or more. From

the elevation on which they stood the spectator
looked down upon the house lying below among its
gardens, on the green terrace and the limes, and
could watch what the group there was doing, while
himself safe from all observation. When Douglas
had informed Anne of her father's rejection of his
suit, she had bidden him come to this spot to hear
the issue of her own interview with Mr. Montfort.
He seated himself tranquilly enough under the lover's
tree to await her coming. He was not too much
agitated to smoke his cigar. Indeed, he was not
much agitated at all. He had no fear for the
eventual issue. True, it might not come immediately.
He did not know that he wanted it to come
immediately. To love is one thing, to marry
another. So long as he was sure of Anne, he did
not mind waiting for a year or two. And he felt
that he was sure of Anne, and in that case, eventually,
of her father too. Consequently, he sat still and
waited, pleased,' in spite of himself, with the little
lawlessness. To be received in the ordinary way asa
son-in-law, to kiss the ladies of the house, and

shake hands with the men, and be told in a trembling
voice that it was the choicest treasure of the family
that was being bestowed upon him, were all things
which a man of courage has to go through, and does
go through without flinching. But on the whole it
was more delightful to have Anne steal away to him
out of all commonplace surroundings and make him
sure of her supreme and unfailing love, whatever
anyone might say  with. Men entendu, the paternal
blessing in the background, to be won after a little
patience. Douglas was flattered in all his wishes
and fancies by this romantic beginning. He would
have the good, he thought, both of the old system of
love-making and the new  Anne by herself, without
any drawbacks, willing to dare any penalties for his
sake ; but at the end everything that was legitimate
and proper  settlements and civilities. He liked it
better so than if it had been necessary to wind up
everything "sin a few months, and marry and be
settled ; indeed it pleased him much, being so sure
as he was of all that was to follow, to have this little
.secret and clandestine intercourse. He liked it.

To get Anne to do so much as this for bim was a
triumph ; his vanity overflowed while he sat and
waited for her, though vanity was but a small part
of his character. He reached that spot so soon that
he saw the beginning of the 'game,' and Anne's
white figure going back through the flower garden
all blazing with colour, to the house. What excuse
had she been able to find for leaving them ? She
must have invented some excuse. And he saw the
curate settling himself to that ' game,' with unspeakable
amusement. He took his cigar from
between his lips to laugh. Poor old Charley! his
heart was broken, but he did his duty like a man.
He watched him settling to his afternoon's work
with Gertrude Woodhead as his partner, and laughed,
feeling the full humour of the event, and enjoying
the tremendous seriousness with which that sacrifice
to duty was made. Then, while the game went on
in the bright foreground of the picture, he saw the
moving speck of that white figure re-issuing on the
other side of the house, and advancing towards him,
threading her way among the trees. It was for him

that Anne did this, and he it was alone of all concerned
who could sit here calmly puffing the blue
smoke among the branches, and waiting for his
happiness to come to him. Never was man more
elated, more flattered, more perfectly contented with
himself.

He threw the cigar away when she was within a
short distance of the spot, and went to meet her
with triumphant pleasure.

My faithful Anne  my true love,' he said as he
met her. And Anne came to him ; her eyes shining,
her lips apart with eagerness. What a meeting it
was ! No tame domestic reception and hubbub of
family excitement could compare with it. How
glad and flattered he felt that it was a clandestine
indulgence, and that papa had not vulgarised everything
by giving his consent ! Then they sat down
upon the knoll, arm linked in arm, and clasping each
other's hands. There was the peaceful house within
sight, and the party on the green terrace absorbed
in their inferior amusement, in complete ignorance,
not knowing what romance was going on, scarcely

out of their range of vision, under the trees. All
these experiences served to enhance the delight
of his position. For the first few minutes he
attached less importance to the words which Anne
said.

But you do not seem to understand me. My
father will not consent.'

If you consent, my darling, what do I want
more ? I am not afraid of your father.'

But Cosmo  listen ! you are not really paying
any attention '

Every attention, to the real matter in question.
I am reading that in your eyes, in your hands, in
sou altogether. If I am too happy to take any
notice of those vulgares symbols, words '

But they are not vulgar symbols. Yes, I am
happy too. I am not afraid of any thing. But, Cosmo,
you must listen, and you must understand. My father
refuses his consent.'

For how long ? ' he said with a smile. ' I also
should like to refuse you something for the pleasure
of being persuaded to forswear myself. I think papa

is right. I should hold out as long as you would put
any faith in the delusion of my resistance

It is no delusion,' said Anne, shaking her head.
You must not think so. It is very serious. He has
threatened me. There was no make-believe in his
mind, Cosmo.'

Threatened you ? With what ? Ah ! so should
I if I thought you were going to desert me.'

You will not see how serious it is ! I do not
believe he will give in, Cosmo. He has threatened
me that if I persevere he will leave everything he
has to leave, away from me.'

Away from you ? But he has no power to do
that,' said the young man. ' It is skilful of him to
try your faithfulness  but he might have tried it by
less conventional means.'

Yes, he has the power,' said Anne, neglecting
the other part of this speech.  He has power over
everything, except, indeed, the entail ; and I believe
he will do what he says. My father is not a man at
all likely to try my faithfulness. He knows me, for
one thing.'

VOL. I. F

And knows you true as steel,' said Cosmo, looking
admiringly in her face and still quite unimpressed by
the news.

Knows that I am not one to give way. He
know-s that very well. So here is something for your
serious consideration. No, indeed, it is no joke. You
must not laugh. We must face what is before us,'
said Anne, endeavouring to withdraw her hand and
half offended by his unbelief.

 I cannot face your frown,' said Cosmo, ' that is
the only thing I am really afraid of. Wljat ! must it
really be so stern as this ? But these hard fathers,
my darling, belong to the fifteenth century. You
don't mean to tell me that rebellious daughters are
shut up in their rooms, and oaths insisted upon, and
paternal curses uttered now ! '

I said nothing about being shut up in my room ;
but it is quite certain,' said Anne, with a little heat,
that if I oppose him in this point my father
will take all that ought to come to me and give it to
Eose.'

To Rose ! ' a shade of dismay stole over Cosmo's

face. ' But I thought,' he said  showing an acquaintance
with the circumstances which after, when
she thought of it, surprised Anne  ' I thought your
fortune came from your mother, not from Mr. Mount-ford
at all.'

And so it does ; but it is all in his hands ; my
mother trusted in my father entirely, as she was of
comes quite right to do.'

As it must have been the height of imprudence
to permit her to do ! ' cried Douglas, suddenly reddening
with anger. ' How could the trustees be such
fools ? So you, like the money, are entirely in Mr.
Montfort's hands ? '

All at once the tone had ceased to be that of a

-Vr

lovers' interview. Anne, startled and offended, this
time succeeded in drawing her hand out of his.

Yes,' she said, with a chill of surprise in her
voice, ' entirely in his hands.'

What was going to follow? Under the great
beechen boughs, through the warm summer sunshine
there seemed all at once to breathe a wintry gale
which penetrated to the heart.

F 2

This sudden cloud was dissipated in a moment
by another laugh, which rang almost too loudly
among the trees. ' Well,' he said, drawing her arm
through his again, and holding the reluctant hand
clasped fast, ' what of that ? Because you are in his
hands, Anne, my own, do you think I am going tolet
you slip out of mine ? '

The sun grew warm again, and the air delicious
as before. Two on one side, and all the world on
the other, is not that a perfectly fair division ? So
long as there are two  if there should come to be but
one, then the aspect of everything is changed. Anne's
hands clasped between two bigger ones all but disappeared
from view. It would be hard, very hard,
to slip out of that hold ; and it was a minute or two
before she regained possession of what Cosmo had
called the vulgares symbols, words. Without recurrence
to their aid between people who love each
other, how much can be said !

That is all very well,' said Anne, at last ;
but whatever we may do or say we must come
back to this: My father has promised to disinherit

me, Cosmo, and he will not go back from his
word.'

Disinherit ! the very word sounds romantic.
Are we in "a novel or are we not? I thought disinherit
was only a word for the stage.'

But you know this is mere levity,' said Anne.
She smiled in spite of herself. It pleased her to the
bottom of her heart that he should take it so lightly,
that he should refuse to be frightened by it. ' Weare
not boy and girl,' she said, with delightful gravity
of reproof. 'We must think seriously of a thing
which affects our interests so much. The question is,
what is to be done ? '

Had she but known how keenly under his levity
he was discussing that question within himself ! But
he went on, still half laughing as if it were the best
joke in the world.

The only thing, so far as I can see, that is not
to be done,' he said, ' is to obey papa and give
me up.'

Give up  I would not give up a dog ! ' cried
Anne, impetuously; ' and Cosmo, you ! '

C-.r

70 IN TRUST.

I am not a dog ; and yet in one sense, in Mr.

Montfort's eyes What is it, Anne, that hedges

you round with such divinity, you landed people ?
Montfort of Mount : it sounds very well, I confess.
And why was I not Douglas of somewhere or
other ? It is very hard upon you, but yet it is not
my fault.'

I like you infinitely better,' cried Anne, with
proud fervour, ' that you are Douglas of nowhere,
but stand upon yourself  the father of your own
fortunes. That is the thing to be proud of  if one
has ever any right to be proud.'

I have not achieved much to be proud of as
yet,' he said, shaking his head ; and then there was
again a pause, perhaps not quite so ecstatic a pause,
for practical necessity and the urgent call for a
decision of one kind or other began to be felt, and
silenced them. It was easy to say that there was
one thing that was not to be done  but after?
Then for the first time in her life Anne felt the
disability of her womanhood. This tells for little so
long as the relations between men and women are

not in question. It is when these ties begin  and a
girl, who has perhaps taken the initiative all her
life, finds herself suddenly reduced to silence in face
of her lover  that the bond is felt. What could she
say or suggest? She had exhausted her powers
when she declared with such proud emphasis that
to give up was impossible. Then nature, which is
above all law, stepped in and silenced her. What
could she do further ? It was for him to speak.
The first sense of this compulsion was both sweet
and painful to her  painful, because her mind was
overflowing with active energy and purpose which
longed for utterance : sweet, as the sign and symbol
of a new condition, a union more rich and strange
than any individuality. Anne had hesitated little
in her life, and had not known what it was to wait.
Now she bent her head to the necessity in a curious
maze of feeling  bewildered, happy, a little impatient,
wondering and hoping, silent as she had never
in all her life before been tempted to be.

As for Douglas, he was silent too, with a much
less delightful consciousness. In such circumstances

what are the natural things for a man to say ?
That what his love has is nothing to him, so long as
she brings him herself  that if there is only a
sacrifice of money in question, no money can be
allowed to stand in the way of happiness ; that he
has no fear, unless it might be for her; that to
labour for her, to make her independent of all the
fathers in the world, is his first privilege ; and that
the only thing to be considered is, when and how
she will make his happiness complete by trusting
herself to his care. These are, no doubt, the right
things for a man to say, especially if they happen to
be true, but even whether they are quite true or not,
as his natural role requires. Then, on the other
side, the woman (if she has any sense) will certainly
come in and impose conditions and limit the fulness
of the sacrifice ; so that, what by masculine boldness
of plan, and feminine caution of revisal, something
reasonable and practical is at last struck out. But
the caution, the repression, the prudence, ought not
to be on the man's side. Nothing can be more
distinct than this great law. It becomes the woman

to see all the drawbacks, to hold back, and to insist
upon every prudential condition, not to make herself
a burden upon him or permit him to be overwhelmed
by his devotion. But it is not from his side that
these suggestions of prudence can be allowed to
come, however strongly he may perceive them.
Perhaps it is as hard upon the man, who sees all
the difficulties, to be compelled to adopt this part,
as it is on the woman, accustomed to lead the way,
to be silent and hold back. Douglas was in this predicament,
if Anne felt all the mingled penalties and
privileges of the other. He must do it, or else acknowledge
himself a poor creature. And Cosmo had not
the slightest inclination to appear a poor creature in
Anne's eyes. Yet at the same time he felt that
to propose to this impetuous girl  who was quite
capable of taking him at his word  that she should
marry him at once in face of her father's menace, was
madness. What was he to do ? He sat silent  for
more minutes than Anne's imagination approved.
Her heart began to sink, a wondering pang to make
itself felt in her breast, not for herself so much as

for him. Was he about to fail to the emergency ?
to show himself unprepared to meet it ? Was he,
could it be possible, more concerned about the loss
of the money than herself ?

'Here am I in a nice predicament,' he burst
forth at last ; ' what am I to say to you ? Anne  you
who have been brought up to wealth, who have
known nothing but luxury  what am I to say to
you ? Is it to be my part to bring you down to
poverty, to limit your existence? I who have no
recommendation save that of loving you, which
heaven knows many a better man must share with
me ; I an intruder whom you did not know a year
ago  an interloper '

There are some cases in which there is no policy
like the naked truth. Anne held up her hands to
stop him as he went on, exclaiming softly, ' Cosmo,
Cosmo ! ' in various tones of reproach and horror.
Then at last she stopped him practically, by putting
one of her hands upon his mouth  an action which
made her blush all over with tender agitation, pleasure,
and shame.

How can you say such things ? Cosmo ! I will
not hear another word.'

Am I anything but an interloper ? How is
any man worth calling a man to let you sacrifice
yourself to him, Anne ? '

I shall soon think it is you that want to throw
me over,' she said.

This shifted the tragic issue of the question and
put him more at ease. If it could but be brought
back to the general ground, on which mutual professions
of fidelity would suffice and time could be
gained ! So far as that went, Cosmo knew very well
what to say. It was only the practical result that
filled him with alarm. Why had he been so hasty
in declaring himself? The preliminaries of courtship
may go on for years, but the moment an answer
has been asked and given, some conclusion must become
to. However, it is always easy to answer a
girl when she utters such words as these. He
eluded the real difficulty, following her lead, and so
filled up the time with lovers' talk that the hour
flew by without any decision. They talked of the

one subject in a hundred different tones  it was all
so new, and Anne was so easily transported into that
vague and beautiful fairyland where her steps were
treading for the first time. And she had so much
to say to him on her side ; and time has wings, and
can fly on some occasions though he is so slow on
others. It was she who at the end of many digressions
finally discovered that while they had
been talking the green terrace below had become
vacant, the company dispersed. She started up in
alarm.

They have all gone in. The game is over.
How long we must have been sitting here ! And
they will be looking for me. I was obliged to say I
had a headache. Indeed I had a headache,' said
Anne, suddenly waking to a sense of her subterfuge
and hanging her head  for he had laughed  which
was a failure of perception on his part and almost
roused her pride to arms. But Cosmo was quick-sighted
and perceived his mistake.

Dear Anne ! is this the first issue of faith tome
? ' he said. ' What am I to do, my darling ?

Kill myself for having disturbed your life and made
your head ache, or '

Do not talk nonsense, Cosmo ; but I must go
home.'

And we have been talking nonsense, and have
come to no settlement one way or another,' he said,
with a look of vexation. Naturally Anne took the
blame to herself. It could only be her fault.

The time has gone so fast,' she said, with a sigh.
But, perhaps, on the whole, it is best not to settle
anything. Let us take a little time to think. Is
there any hurry ? Nobody can separate us so long
as we are faithful to each other. There is no need
that I know for  any conclusion.'

Poor Cosmo ! there were points in which at this
moment his was a hard case. He was obliged to
look vexed and complain, though he was so fully
convinced of the wisdom of this utterance. 'You
forget,' he said tenderly, * that I have to go away,
to return to my life of loneliness  perhaps to ask
myself if Anne was only a heavenly dream, a
delusion, and to find myself waking '

To what ? ' she replied, in her enthusiasm, half
angry, ' to what ? ' If you have my heart with you
and my thoughts, is not that the best part of me ?
The Anne that will be with you will be the true
Anne, not the outside of her which must stay
here.'

But I want the outside too. Ah, Anne, if I
were to stay here, if I could live at your gate like
Charley Ashley (poor fellow !). But you forget that
I must go away.'

I don't forget it. When must you go ? ' She
sank her voice a little and drew closer to him, and
looked at him with a cloud rising over her face. He
must go, there was no eluding that certainty, and to
think of it was like thinking of dying  yet of a
sweet death to be borne heroically for the sake each
of each, and with a speedy bright resurrection in
prospect ; but it would be an extinction of all the
delight of living so long as it lasted. Cosmo's mind
was not so elevated as Anne's, nor his imagination
so inspiring, but the look of visionary anguish and
courage went to his heart

*I don't deserve it,' be cried with a broken voice;
which was very true. Then recovering himself, ' It
would not do for me to linger after what bas passed
between your father and me. It will be a terrible
wrench, and without knowing when we are to meet
again. Love, it must be before Saturday,' he
said.

They were standing close, very close together,
clasping each other's hands. Two tears came into
Anne's eyes, great lakes of moisture not falling,
though brimming over. But she gave him such a
smile as was all the sweeter reflected in them, ' By
Friday, then  we must make up our minds what weare
to do.'

His fears and doubtfulness yielded for the
moment to an impulse of real emotion. ' How am
I to live without you, now that I know you ? ' he
said.

You will not be without me, Cosmo ! Did I not
tell you the best of me would be with you always ?
Let us both think with all our might what will bethe
right thing for us.'

I know what I shall feel to be the best, Anne.'
He said this with a little fervour, suddenly coming
to see  as now and then a man does  by a sudden
inspiration, entirely contrary to his judgment, what
would be his only salvation. This answered his
purpose far better than any cleverness he could have
invented. She shook her head.

'We must not insist on choosing the happiest
way,' she said. ' We must wait  in every way, I
feel sure that to wait is the only thing we can
do.'

Certainly not the happiest,' he said, with emphasis.
' There is no reason because of that interview
with your father why I should not come to say
good-bye. I will come on Friday publicly; but
tomorrow, Anne, tomorrow, here '

She gave him her promise without hesitation.
There had been no pledge against seeing him asked
or given, and it was indispensable that they should
settle their plans. And then they parted, he, in the
agitation and contagious enthusiasm of the moment,
drawn closer to the girl whom he loved, but did not

understand, nearer knowing her than he had ever
been before. The impulse kept him up as on
borrowed wings as far as the enclosure of the park.
Then Cosmo Douglas dropped down to earth, ceased
to reflect Anne Montfort, and became himself.
Isle on wings which were her own, and borrowed
from no one  wings of pure visionary passion, devotion,
faith  skimmed through the light air homeward,
her heart wrung, her sweet imagination full of
visions, her courage and constancy strong as for life
or death.

VOL. I.

CHAPTER V.

EXPLANATIONS.

It is an awkward and a painful thing to quarrel
with a friend when he is staying under your roof;
though in that case it will no doubt make a breach,
and he will go away, which will relieve you, even if
you regret it afterwards. But if there is no quarrel,
yet you find out suddenly that you have a grievance
a grievance profound and bitter, but not permitting
of explanation  the state of affairs is more
painful still ; especially if the friend is thrown into
your special society, and not taken from you by the
general courtesies of the house. It was in this unfortunate
position that the young men at the Rectory
found themselves on the evening that followed.
There was nobody in the house to diminish the
pressure. Mrs Ashley had died some years before,

and the Rector, at that time left much alone, as both
his sons were absent at school and university, had
fallen into the natural unsocial habits of a solitary.
He had been obliged to make life bearable for himself
by perpetual reading, and now he could do little
but read. He was very attentive to his duty, visiting
his sick parishioners with the regularity of clockwork,
and not much more warmth ; but when he
came in he went to his study, and even at table
would furtively bring a book with him, to be gone
on with if the occasion served. Charley and Willie
were resigned enough to this shutting out of their
father from the ordinary social intercourse. It
liberated them from the curb imposed by his grave
looks and silence. He had always been a silent man.
Now that he had not his wife to speak to, utterance
was a trouble to him. And even his meals were a
trouble to Mr. Ashley. He would have liked his
tray brought into his study among his books, which
was the doleful habit he had fallen into when he
was left to eat the bread of tears alone. He gave
up this gratification when the boys were at home,

G 2

but it cost him something. And he painfully refrained
even from a book when there were visitors,
and now and then during the course of a meal would
make a solemn remark to them. He was punctilious
altogether about strangers, keeping a somewhat
dismal watch to see that they were not neglected.
This it was which had brought him out of his study
when he saw Douglas alone upon the lawn. ' In
your mother's time,' he would say, 'this was considered
a pleasant house to stay at. I have given
p asking people on my own account ; but when you
have friends I insist upon attention being paid
them.' This made the curate's position doubly
irksome ; he had to entertain the stranger who was
his own friend, yet had, he felt, betrayed him. There
was nothing to take Douglas even for an hour off
his hands. Willie, as the spectator and sympathiser,
was even more indignant than his brother, and
disposed to show his indignation ; and the curate
had to satisfy his father and soothe Willie, and go
through a semblance of intimate intercourse with
his friend all at the same time. His heart was very

heavy ; and, at the best of times, his conversation
was not of a lively description ; nor had he the power
of throwing off his troubles. The friend who had
proved a traitor to him had been his leader, the
first fiddle in every orchestra where Charley Ashley
had produced his solemn bass. All this made the
state of affairs more intolerable. In the evening
what could they do ? They had to smoke together
in the little den apportioned to this occupation,
which the Rector himself detested ; for it rained, to
wind up all those miseries. As long as it was fine,
talk could be eluded by strolling about the garden ;
but in a little room, twelve feet by eight, with their
pipes lit and everything calculated to make the
contrasts of the broken friendship seem stronger,
what could be done ? The three young men sat
solemnly, each in a corner, puffing forth clouds
of serious smoke. Willie had got a ' Graphic,' and
was turning it over, pretending to look at the
pictures. Charley sat at the open window, with his
elbow leaning upon the sill, gazing out into the
blackness of the rain. As for Douglas, he tilted his

chair back on its hind legs, and looked just as usual
a smile even hovered about his mouth. He was
the offender, but there was no sense of guilt in his
mind. The cloud which had fallen on their relationship
amused him instead of vexing him. It wrapped
Charley Ashley in the profoundest gloom, who was
innocent ; but it rather exhilarated the culprit. Ten
minutes had passed, and not a word had been said,
which was terrible to the sons of the house, but
agreeable enough to their guest. He had so much
to think of; and what talk could be so pleasant as
his own thoughts ? certainly not poor Ashley's prosy
talk. He swayed himself backward now and then
on his chair, and played a tune with his fingers on
the table ; and a smile hovered about his mouth.
He had passed another hour under the Beeches
before the rain came on, and everything had been
settled to his satisfaction. He had not required to
make any bold proposal, and yet he had been argued
with and sweetly persuaded as if he had suggested
the rashest instantaneous action. He could not but
feel that he had managed this very cleverly, and he

was pleased with himself, and happy. He did not
want to talk ; he had Anne to think about, and all
her tender confidences, and her looks and ways
altogether. She was a girl whose love any man
might have been proud of. And no doubt the
father's opposition would wear away. He saw no
reason to be uneasy about the issue. In these days
there is but one way in which such a thing can end,
if the young people hold out. And, with a smile of
happy assurance, he said to himself that Anne would
hold out. She was not a girl that was likely to
change.

Some trifling circumstance here attracted Cosmo's
attention to the very absurd aspect of affairs. A
big moth, tumbling in out of the rain, flew
straight at the candle, almost knocked the light
out, burned off its wings, poor imbecile, and fell
with a heavy thud, scorched and helpless ! upon
the floor. The curate, whose life was spent on
summer evenings in a perpetual crusade against those
self-destroying insects, was not even roused from his
gloom by this brief and rapidly-concluded tragedy.

He turned half round, gave a kind of groan byway
of remark, and turned again to his gloomy
gaze into the rain. Upon this an impulse, almost
of laughter, seized Douglas in spite of himself.
Charley, old fellow, what are you so grumpy
about ? ' he said.

This observation from the culprit, whom they
were both trying their best not to fall upon and slay,
was as a thunderbolt falling between the two brothers.
The curate turned his pale countenance round with a
look of astonishment. But Willie jumped up from
his chair. ' I can't stand this,' he said, ' any longer.
Why should one be so frightened of the rain? I
don't know what you other fellows mean to do, but I
am going out.'

And we are going to have it out,' said Cosmo, as
the other hurried away. He touched the foot of the
curate, who had resumed his former attitude, with his
own. ' Look here, Charley, don't treat me like this ;
what have I done ? ' he said.

Done ? I don't know what you mean. Nothing,'
said the curate, turning his head round

once more, but still with his eyes fixed on the
rain.

Come in, then, and put it into words. You
should not condemn the greatest criminal without a
hearing. You think somehow  why shouldn't you
own it ? it shows in every look  you think I have
stood in your way.'

No,' said Ashley again. His under-lip went outwith
a dogged resistance, his big eyelids drooped.
I haven't got much of a way  the parish, that's
about all  I don't see how you could do me any
damage there.'

Why are you so bitter, Charley ? If you had
ever taken me into your confidence you may be sure
I would not have interfered  whatever it might
have cost me.'

'I should like to know what you are talking
about,' the other said, diving his hands into the
depths of his pockets, and turning to the rain once
more.

Would you ? I don't think it ; and it's no good
naming names. Look here. Will you believe me

if I say I never meant to interfere ? I never found
out what was in your mind till it was too late.'

I don't know that there is anything in my mind,'
Charley said. He was holding out with all his might ;
but the fibres of his heart were giving way, and the
ice melting. To be sure, how should any one have
found out ? had it not been hidden away at the very
bottom of his heart ? Anne had never suspected it,
how should Cosmo? He would not even turn his
head to speak ; but he was going, going ! he felt it,
and Douglas saw it. The offender got up, and
laid his hand upon the shoulder of his wounded
friend.

I'd rather have cut off my hand, or tugged out
my heart, than wound you, Charley ; but I never
knew till it was too late.'

All this, perhaps, was not quite true ; but it was
true  enough. Douglas did not want to quarrel ; he
liked his faithful old retainer. A bird in the hand 
that is always worth something, though perhaps not
so much as is the worth of the two who are in the
bush ; and he is a foolish man who will turn away the

certain advantage of friendship for the chance of
love; anyhow, the address went entirely into the
simple, if wounded, heart.

I didn't mean to show I was vexed. I don't
know that I'm vexed  a man is not always in the
same disposition,' he said, but his voice was changing.
Douglas patted him on the shoulder, and went back
to his seat.

You needn't envy me  much,' said Douglas.
< We don't know what's to come of it; the father
won't hear of me. He would have had nothing to
say to you either, and think what a rumpus it would
have made in the parish ! And there's the Rector to
think of. Charley '

Perhaps you are right,' Charley said, with a
great heave of his shoulders. His pipe had gone out.
As he spoke, he got up slowly, and came to the table
to look for the matches. Cosmo lighted one, and
held it out to him, looking on with interest while the
solemn process of rekindling was gone through.
Charley's face, lighted by the fitful flame as he puffed,
was still as solemn as if it had been a question of life

and death ; and Cosmo, looking on, kept his gravity
too. When this act was accomplished, the curate in
silence gripped his friend's hand, and thus peace was
made. Poor faithful soul ; his heart was still as heavy
as lead  but pain was possible, though strife was not
possible. A load was taken off his honest breast.

I've seen it coming,' he said, puffing harder than
was needful. ' I oughtn't to have felt it so much.
After all, why should I grumble ? I never could
have been the man.'

You are a far better fellow than I am,' cried the
other, with a little burst of real feeling.

Charley puffed and puffed, with much exertion.
The red gleam of the pipe got reflected under his
shaggy eyebrows in something liquid. Then he
burst into an unsteady laugh.

You might as well fire a damp haystack as light
a pipe that's gone out,' was the next sentimental
remark he made.

Have a cigar ? ' said Cosmo, tenderly, producing
a case out of his pocket, with eager benevolence.
And thus their peace was made. Anne's name was

not mentioned, neither was there anything said but
these vague allusions to the state of affairs generally.
Of all things in the world sentimental explanations
are most foreign to the intercourse of young Englishmen
with each other. But when Willie Ashley
returned, very wet, and with an incipient cold in his
head from the impatient flight he had made, he was
punished for his cowardly abandonment of an unpleasant
position by finding his brother with the old
bonds refitted upon him, completely restored to his
old devotion and subjection to Cosmo. Willie
retired to bed soon after, kicking off his boots with
an energy which was full of wrath. ' The fool ! ' he
said to himself ; while the reconciled pair carried on
their tobacco and their reunion till far in the night.
They were not conversational, however, though they
were reconciled. Conversation was not necessary to
the curate's view of social happiness, and Cosmo was
glad enough to go back upon his own thoughts.

While this was going on at the Kectory, Anne
for her part was submitting to a still more severe
course of interrogation. Mrs. Montfort had discussed

the question with herself at some lengthy
whether she should take any notice or not of the
domestic convulsion which had occurred under her
very eye without having been brought openly to her
cognisance. Her husband had of course told her all
about it; but Anne had not said anything  had
neither consulted her stepmother nor sought her
sympathy. After a while, however, Mrs. Montfort
sensibly decided that to ignore a matter of such importance,
or to make-believe that she was not acquainted
with it, would be equally absurd. Accordingly
she arranged that Rose should be sent for after
dinner to have a dress tried on ; which was done,
to that young lady's great annoyance and wrath.
Mrs. Worth, Mrs. Montfort's maid, was not a
person who could be defied with impunity. She was
the goddess Fashion, La Mode imper signified at
Mount. Under her orders she had a niece, who
served as maid to Anne and Rose ; and these two
together made the dresses of the family. It was a
great economy, Mrs. Montfort said, and all the-county

knew how completely successful it was. But
to the girls it was a trouble, if an advantage. Mrs.
Worth studied their figures, their complexions, and
what she called their ' hidiousincrasies '  but she
did not study the hours that were convenient for
them, or make allowance for their other occupations.
And she was a tyrant, if a beneficent one. So Rose
had to go, however loth. Lady Meadowlands was
about to give a fete, a great garden party, at which
all ' the best people ' were to be assembled. And a
new dress was absolutely necessary. ' Wouldn't it
do in the morning ? ' she pleaded. But Mrs. Worth
was inexorable. And so it happened that her mother
had a quiet half-hour in which to interrogate Anne.
The drawing-room was on the side of the house
overlooking the flower garden ; the windows, a great
row of them, flush with the wall outside and so
possessing each a little recess of its own within, were
all open, admitting more damp than air, and a chilly
freshness and smell of the earth instead of the scents
of the mignonette. There were two lamps at different

ends of the room, which did not light it very
well : but Mrs. Montfort was economical. Anne
had lit the candles on the writing-table for her own
use, and she was a long way off the sofa on which
her stepmother sat, with her usual tidy basket of
neatly-arranged wools beside her. A little time
passed in unbroken quiet, disturbed by nothing but
the soft steady downfall of the rain through the
great open space outside, and the more distant sound
of pattering upon the trees. When Mrs. Montfort
said 'Anne,' her stepdaughter did not hear herat
first. But there was a slight infraction of
the air, and she knew that something had been
said.

Did you speak, mamma ? '

I want to speak to you, Anne. Yes, I think I
did say your name. Would you mind coming here
for a little ? I want to say something to you while
Rose is away.'

Anne divined at once what it must be. And she
was not unreasonable  it was right that Mrs. Mount-ford

should know: how could she help but know,
being the wife of one of the people most concerned ?
And the thing which Anne chiefly objected to was
that her stepmother knew everything about her by a
sort of back way, thus arriving at a clandestine
knowledge not honestly gained. It was not the
stepmother that was to blame, but the father and
fate. She rose and went forward slowly through the
partial light  reluctant to be questioned, yet not
denying that to ask was Mrs. Montfort's right.

I sent her away on purpose, Anne. She is too
young. I don't want her to know any more than
can be helped. My dear, I was very sorry to hear
from your father that you had got into that kind of
trouble so soon.'

I don't think I have got into any trouble.' said
Anne.

 No, of course I suppose you don't think so ; but
I have more experience than you have, and I am
sorry your mind should have been disturbed so soon.'

Do you call it so very soon ? ' said Anne. ' I
am twenty-one.'

VOL. I. H

So you are ; I forgot. Well ! but it is always
too soon when it is not suitable, my dear.'

It remains to be seen whether it is not suitable,
mamma.'

My love ! do you think so little of your father's
opinion ? That ought to count above everything
else, Anne. A gentleman is far better able to form
an opinion of another gentleman than we are. Mr,
Douglas, I allow, is good-looking and well-bred.
I liked him well enough myself; but that is
not all  you must acknowledge that is not half
enough.'

My father seems to want a great deal less,' said
Anne ; ' all that he asks is about his family and his
money.'

Most important particulars, Anne, however
romantic you may be ; you must see that.'

I am not romantic,' said Anne, growing red,
and resenting the imputation, as was natural ; ' and
I do not ny they are important details ; but not
surely to be considered first as the only things worth
caring for  which is what my father does.'

What do you consider the things worth caring
for, dear ? Be reasonable. Looks ? ' said Mrs.
Montfort, laying down her work upon her lap with
a benevolent smile. ' Oh, Anne, my dear child, at
your age we are always told that beauty is skin-deep,
but we never believe it. And I am not one
that would say very much in that respect. I like
handsome people myself; but dear, dear, as life
goes on, if you have nothing but looks to trust
to !'

I assure you,' said Anne, vehemently, succeeding
after two or three attempts to break in, ' I should
despise myself if I thought that beauty was anything.
It is almost as bad as money. Neither the
one nor the other is yourself.'

Oh, I would not go so far as that,' said Mrs.
Montfort, with indulgence. ' Beauty is a great
deal in my opinion, though perhaps it is gentlemen
that think most about it. But, my dear Anne, you
are a girl that has always thought of ,duty. I will
do you the justice to say that. You may have liked

H 2

sour own way, but even to me, that have not the
first claim upon you, you have always been very
good. I hope you are not going to be rebellious
now. You must remember that your father's judgment
is far more mature than yours. He knows the
world. He knows what men are.'

So long as he does not know  one thing,' said
Anne, indignantly, ' what can all that other information
matter to me ? '

And what is the one thing, dear ? ' Mrs. Mount-ford
said.

Anne did not immediately reply. She went to
the nearest window and closed it, for sheer necessity
of doing something ; then lingered, looking out upon
the rain and the darkness of the night.

Thank you, that is quite right,' said her stepmother.
' I did not know that window was open.
How damp it is, and how it rains ! Anne, what is
the one thing ? Perhaps I might be of some use if
you would tell me. What is it your father does not
know ? '

Me,' said Anne, coming slowly back to the light.
Her slight white figure had the pose of a tall lily,
so light, so firm, that its very fragility looked like
strength. And her face was full of the constancy
upon which, perhaps, she prided herself a little 
the loyalty that would not give up a dog, as she said.
Mrs. Montfort called it obstinacy, of course. ' But
what does that matter,' she added, with some
vehemence, ' when in every particular we are at
variance ? I do not think as he does in anything.
What he prizes I do not care for and what I
prize '

My dear, it is your father you are speaking of.
Of course he must know better than a young girl
like you '

Mamma, it is not his happiness that is involved
it is mine ! and I am not such a young girl  I
am of age. How can he judge for me in what is to
be the chief thing in my life ? '

Anne,' said Mrs. Montfort kindly, ' this young
man is almost a stranger to you  you had never

seen him a year ago. Is it really true, and are you
quite sure that this involves the happiness of your
life ? '

Anne made no reply. How otherwise ? she said
indignantly in her heart. Was she a girl to deceive
herself in such a matter  was she one to make
protestations? She held hsr head high, erecting
her white throat more like a lily than ever. But
she said nothing. What was there to say ? She
could not speak or tell anyone but herself what
Cosmo was to her. The sensitive blood was ready
to mount into her cheeks at the mere breathing of
his name.

Mrs. Montfort shook her head. ' Oh, foolish
children,' she said, 'you are all the same. Don't
think you are the only one, Anne. When you areas
old as I am you will have learned that a father's
opinion is worth taking, and that your own is not so
infallible after all.'

I suppose,' said Anne softly, ' you are twice my
age, mamma  that would be a long time to wait to
see which of us was right.'

'I am more than twice yom* age,' said Mrs.
Montfort, with a little heat ; then suddenly
changing her tone, ' Well ! so this is the new fashion
we have been hearing so much of. Turn round
slowly that I may see if it suits you. Rose.'

CHAPTER VI.

Good-bye.

Next day was one of those crowning days of summer
which seem the climax, and at the same time the
conclusion, of the perfect year. From morning till
night there was no shadow upon it, no threatening
of a cloud, no breath of unfriendly air. The flowers
in the Mount gardens blazed from the level beds in
their framework of greenness, the great masses of
summer foliage stood out against the soft yet
brilliant sky ; every outline was round and distinct,
detaching itself in ever-varying lines, one curve
upon another. Had the weather been less perfect
their distinctness would have been excessive and
marred the unity of the landscape, but the softness
of the summer air harmonised everything in sight
and sound alike. The voices on the terrace mingled

in subtle musical tones at intervals ; and, though
every branch of the foliage was perfect in itself, yet
all were melodiously mingled, and belonged to each
other. On the sea-shore and among the hills
distance seemed annihilated, and every outline
pressed upon the eye, too bright, too near for
pleasure, alarming the weather wise. But here, so
warmly inland, in a landscape so wealthy and so
soft, the atmosphere did not exaggerate, it only
brightened. It was the end of August, and changes
were preparing among the elements. Next day it
might be autumn with a frost-touch somewhere, the
first yellow leaf; but to-day it was full summer, a
meridian more rich than that of June, yet still
meridian, full noon of the seasons.

11 nous reste un gateau de fete ;
Demain nous aurons du pain noir :

Anne woke up this heavenly morning saying these
words to herself. It had rained half the night
through, and the morning had risen pale, exhausted
as with all this weeping : but after awhile had
thought better of it, and sworn to have, ere summer

ended, one other resplendent day. Then the sun
had got up to his work like a bridegroom, eternal
image, in a flush of sacred pride and joy. People
said to each other ' What a lovely day ! ' Though it
had been a fine summer, and the harvest had been
got in with the help of many a lusty morning and
blazing afternoon, yet there was something in this
that touched the general heart ; perhaps because it
was after the rain, perhaps because something in the
air told that it was the last, that Nature had surpassed
herself, and after this was capable of nothing
further. As a matter of fact, nobody could do anything
for the delight of the exquisite morning.
First one girl stole out, and then another, through
the garden, upon which the morning sun was shining ;
then Mrs. Montfort sailed forth under the shelter
of her parasol. Even she, though she was half
ashamed of herself, being plump, had put on, dazzled
by the morning, a white gown. ' Though I am too
old for white,' she said with a sigh. ' Not too old,
but a little too stout, 'm,' said Mrs. Worth, with
that ferocious frankness which we have all to submit

to from our maids. None of the three reappeared
again till the luncheon-bell rang, so demoralised
were they. Anne, if truth must be told, went
towards the Beeches : ' II nous reste un gateau de
fete,' she sang to herself under her breath, ' Demain
nous aurons du pain noir.'

The same thing happened at the Kectory : even
the rector himself came out, wandering, by way of
excusing himself for the idleness, about the flowerbeds.
' The bedding-out plants have done very well
this year,' he said ; but he was not thinking of the
bedding-out plants any more than the young men
were thinking of their cigars. In their minds there
was that same sense of the one bit of cake remaining
to eat which was in Anne's song. Charley, who had
not the cake, but was only to stand by and assist
while his friend eat it, was sympathetically excited,
yet felt a little forlorn satisfaction in the approaching
resumption of the pain noir. He was never to
get anything better, it appeared; but it would be
pleasant fare when the munching of the gateau
was over. And Douglas stole off to consume that last

morsel when the curate, reluctantly, out of the
sweetness of the morning, went off to his schools.
Under the Beeches the day was like a fresh bit out
of Paradise. If Adam and Eve are only a fable, as
the scientific gentlemen say, what a poet Moses was !
Eden has never gone out of fashion to this day.
The two under the trees, but for her muslin and his
tweed, were, over again, the primaeval pair  and
perhaps the serpent was about too : but neither Eve
had seen it, nor Adam prepared that everlasting plea
of self-defence which has been handed down through
all his sons. This was how the charmed hours stole
on, and the perfection of summer passed through
the perfection of noon ; so many perfections touching
each other ! a perfect orb of loveliness and
happiness, with that added grace which makes perfection
more perfect, the sense of incompleteness 
the human crown of hope. All the time they were
thinking of the something better, something
sweeter, that was to come. ' Will there ever be
such another perfect day ? ' she said, in a wonder at
the new discovered bliss with which she was surrounded.

'Yes, the next,' he said, *on which we
shall not have to part.' To be sure : there was the
parting ; without that conclusion, perhaps, this hour
would not have been so exquisite : but it was still
some hours off, thank heaven !

After luncheon the chairs were carried out to the
green terrace where the shadow of the limes fell.
The limes got in the way of the sun almost as soon
as he began to descend, and threw the most delicious
dancing shadow over the grass  a shadow that
was quite effectual, and kept the lawn as cool as in
the middle of a forest, but which was in itself a
lovely living thing, in soft perpetual motion, every
little twig and green silken leaf contributing its
particular canopy, and flinging down a succession of
little bobs and curtseys with every breath of air
that blew. ' Everybody will be out to-day, and I
daresay we shall have a great many visitors. Tell
Saymore he may bring out the big table,' said Mrs.
Montfort. She liked to feel that her house was the
chief house in the neighbourhood, the place to which
everybody came. Mrs. Montfort had regretfully

relinquished by this time her white gown. We all
cling to our white gowns, but when you are stout, it
must be acknowledged the experiment is rash. She
had not been able to get Mrs. Worth's candid
criticism out of her mind all the morning. ' Do I
look very stout, Eose ? ' she had said, in an unconsciously
ingratiating tone. And Eose was still
more entirely impartial than Worth. She threw a
careless glance at her mother. 'You do look fat,
mamma ! ' she said. It was hard upon the poor
lady ; she changed it, with a sigh, for her darkest
silk. 'Not black. Worth,' she said faintly. 'If I
had my way, 'm,' said Worth, ' I'd dress you always
in black. There is nothing like it when one gets to
a certain time of life.' It was under the influence of
this sobering douche that Mrs. Montfort came out
again, accompanied by Saymore with her workbasket.
It was put down upon the table, a dazzling bit of
colour. ' But I really don't feel inclined to work.
It is too fine to work,' Mrs. Montfort said. ' What
is that you are singing for ever, Anne ? I have heard
you at it all day.'

II nous reste un gateau de fete ;
Demain nous aurons du pain noir.

Anne sang without changing colour, though her
heart was beating ; she had become too breathless
for conversation. When would he come for the
farewell, and what would her father say ? Would he
hear of it and come out? What was to happen?
She sat very still in her basket-chair, with all the
lime leaves waving over her, letting in stray gleams
of sunshine that ornamented her as with lines of
jewels here and there.

Then, after an interval, two dark figures were
seen upon the whiteness and unsheltered light of
the road through the park, ' There are the Ashley
boys,' said Eose. ' Anne, you will be obliged to play
to-day.'

The Ashley boys ! Now that Charley is ordained,
you should speak with more respect,' said Mrs.
Moimtford. Anne looked up, and her heart seemed
to stand still  only two of them ! But she soon
satisfied herself that it was not Cosmo that was the

defaulter ; she sat, not saying anything, scarcely
daring to breathe. The moment had come.

Willie Ashley had not regarded with much satisfaction
the reconciliation which he found to his
great amazement had taken place while he was out
in the rain. Indeed the attitude of his mind had
been nothing less than one of disgust, and when he
found next day that Douglas was setting out arm-in-arm
with the curate, and almost more confidential
than before, to walk to Mount, his impatience rose
to such a point that he flung off altogether. ' Two
may be company, but three is none,' he said to his
brother. ' I thought you had a little more spirit ;
I'm not going to Mount : if you can see yourself cut
out like that, I can't. I'll walk up as far as the
Woodheads' ; I daresay they'll be very glad to getup
a game there.' This was how there were only
two figures on the road. They were very confidential,
and perhaps the curate was supported more
than he himself was aware by the certainty that his
friend was going away that night. Henceforward
the field would be clear. It was not that he had

any hope of supplanting Cosmo in his turn, as he
had been supplanted ; but still to have him away
would be something'. The black bread is wholesome

o

fare enough when there is not some insolent happiness
in the foreground insisting upon devouring
before you its hunches of cake.

I declare,' said Mrs. Montfort, ' there is that
Mr. Douglas with Charley Ashley ! What am I todo?
I am sure it is not Willie  he is taller and
bigger, and has a different appearance altogether.
You cannot expect me, Anne, to meet anyone whom
papa disapproves. What shall I do ? Eun, Rose,
and tell Saymore ; but of course Charley will not
knock at the door like an ordinary visitor  he will
come straight here. I have always thought these
familiarities should not have been permitted. They
will come straight here, though they know he has
been sent away and forbidden the house.'

He has never been forbidden the house,' cried
Anne indignantly. ' I hope, mamma, you will not
be so uncivil as to refuse to say good-bye to Mr.
Douglas. He is going away.'

VOL. I. I

Forbidden the house ! ' cried Rose, her eyes
opening up like two great O's. ' Then it is true ! '

You had better go away at least, if I must stay,
said Mrs. Montfort in despair. 'Rosie, run indoors
and stay in the drawing-room till he is gone.
It would be in far better taste, Anne, and more
dutiful, if you were to go too.'

Anne did not say a word, partly, no doubt, in
determined resistance, but partly because just then
her voice had failed her, the light was swimming in
her eyes, and the air seemed to be full of pairs of
dark figures approaching from every different way.

Run indoors ! why should I ? ' said Rose. ' He
can't do any harm to me; besides I like Mr.
Douglas. Why shouldn't he come and say goodbye
? It would be very uncivil of him if he didn't,
after being so much here.'

That is just what I am always saying ; you have
them constantly here, and then you are surprised
when things happen,' cried Mrs. Montfort, wringing
her hands. ' Anne, if you have any feeling you
ought to take your sister away.' 

Rose's eyes grew rounder and rounder. ' Was it
me he was in love with, then ? ' she asked, not without
reason. But by this time it was too late for anyone
to run away, as the young men were already making
their way across the flower-garden, and could see
every movement the ladies made.

Sit down, sit down, if it must be so,' said Mrs.
Montfort, ' and for heaven's sake let us have no
scene ; look at least as if it were a common call and
meant nothing  that is the only thing to do now.'
How d'ye do, how d'ye do, Charley,' she said, waving
her hand in friendly salutation ; ' was there ever
such a lovely day ? Come and sit down ; it is too
fine for a game. Is that Mr. Douglas you have with
you ? I was quite blinded with the sun this morning,
I can't get it out of my eyes. How do you do ?
you will excuse my looking surprised ; I thought I
heard that you had gone away.'

Not yet,' he said ; ' I hope you did not think
me so little grateful for all your kindness as not to
make my acknowledgments before leaving the parish.

1 2

I have lingered longer than I ought to have done,
but every happiness must come to an end, and I am
bound for Beacon this afternoon to catch the Scotch
mail to-night.'

Mrs. Montfort made him a little bow, by way
of showing that her interest in this was no more
than politeness demanded, and returned to the
curate, to whom she was not geneidily so gracious.
I hope your father is well,' she said ; ' and Willie,
where is Willie ? It is not often he fails. When
we saw you crossing the park just now I made sure
it was Willie that was with you. I suppose we
shall not have him much longer. He should not
disappoint his friends like this.'

T fear,' said Douglas (' thrusting himself in
again ; so ill-bred, when he could see I meant to
snub him,' Mrs. Montfort said), ' that Willie's
absence is my fault. He likes to have his brother
to himself, and I don't blame him. However, I am
so soon to leave the coast clear ! If anything could
have made it more hard to turn one's back upon
Mount it would de leaving it on such a day. Fancy

going from this paradise of warmth and sunshine to
the cold North ! '

'To Scotland?' cried Ross; 'that's just what I
should like to do. You may call this paradise if
you like, but it's dull. Paradise would be dull
always, don't you think, with nothing happening.
To be sure, there's Lady Meadowlands' fete ; but
one knows exactly what that will be at least,
almost exactly,' Eose added, brightening a little,
and feeling that a little opening was left for fate.

 Let us hope it will be as different as possible
from what you expect. I have known garden-parties
turn out so that one was not in the least
like another,' said Douglas smilingly, accepting the
transfer to Eose which Mrs. Montfort's too apparent
snub made necessary. Anne, for her part,
did not say a word ; she sat quite still in the low
basket-chair, scarcely venturing to look up, listening
to the tones of his voice and the smile which seemed
to pervade his words with that strange half-stunned,
half-happy sensation which precedes a parting. Yes,
it was happiness still to feel him there, and recognise

every distinctive sound of the voice which had
awoke her heart. Was there no way of stopping
this flying moment, arresting it, so that it should
last, or coming to an end in it, which is the suggested
sentiment of all perfection ? She sat as in a dream,
longing to make it last, yet impatient that it should
be over ; wondering how it was to end, and whether
any words more important than these might pass
between them still. They had taken farewell of
each other under the Beeches. This postscript was
almost more than could be borne  intolerable, yet
sweet. The voices went on, while the scene turned
round and round with Anne, the background of the
flowers confusing her eyes, and the excitement
mounting to her head. At last, before they had
been a moment there, she thought  though it
was half an hour  the dark figures had risen up
again and hands were being held out. Then she
felt her dress twitched, and 'Let us walk to the end
of the garden with them,' said Rose. This made a
little commotion, and Anne in her dream felt Mrs.
Montfort's expostulation  ' Girls ! ' in a horrified

undertone, ' what can you be thinking of? Rosie,
are you crazy ? Anne ! '

This last was almost in a shriek of excitement.
But Rose was far too much used to her own way to
pay any attention. ' Come along,' she said, linking
her fingers in her sister's. Anne, who was the leader
in everything, followed for the first time in her life.

The garden was sweet with all manner of autumn
flowers, banks of mignonette and heliotrope perfuming
the air, and red geraniums blazing in the sunshine
 all artificial in their formal beds, just as this
intercourse was artificial, restrained by the presence
of spectators and the character of the scene. By-and-by,
however. Rose untwined her hand from her
sister's. ' There is no room to walk so many abreast ;
go on with Mr. Douglas, Anne ; I have something to
say to Charley,' the girl cried. She was curious,
tingling to her fingers' ends with a desire to know
all about it. She turned her round eyes upon
Charley with an exciting look of interrogation as
soon as the other pair had gone on before. Poor
Ashley had drooped his big head ; he would have

turned his back if he could to give them the benefit
of this last moment, but he felt that he could not be
expected not to feel it. And as for satisfying the
curiosity of this inquisitive imp, whose eyes grew
bigger and bigger every moment ! he dropped his
nice brown beard upon his bosom, and sighed, and
slightly shook his head. ' Tell me what it means, or
I'll tell mamma you're helping them,' whispered
Rose. ' Can't you see what it means ? ' said the
curate, with a glance, she thought, of contempt.
What did she know about it ? A blush of humiliation
at her own ignorance flew over Rose.

'I owe your little sister something for this,' said
Douglas, under his breath. ' Once more we two
against the world, Anne ! '

'Not against the world; everything helps us,
Cosmo. I did not think I could even venture to
look at you, and now we can say good-bye again.'

His fingers twined into hers among the folds of
her gown, as Eose's had done a minute before. They
could say good-bye again, but they had no words.
They moved along together slowly, not walking that

they knew of, carried softly as by a wave of supreme
emotion ; then, after another moment, Anne felt the
landscape slowly settling, the earth and the sky getting
back into their places, and she herself coming down
by slow gyrations to earth again. She was standing
still at the corner of the garden, with once more two
dark figures upon the white road, but this time not
approaching  going away.

Tell me about it, tell me all about it, Anne. I
did it on purpose ; I wanted to see how you would
behave. You just behaved exactly like other
people, and shook hands with him the same as I did.
I will stand your friend with papa and everybody if
you will tell me all about it, Anne.'

Mrs. Montfort also was greatly excited ; she
came sailing down upon them with her parasol expanded
and fanning herself as she walked. ' I never
had such a thing to do,' she said ; ' I never had such
an awkward encounter in my life. It is not that I
have any dislike to the man, he has always been
very civil ; though I must say, Anne, that I think,
instead of coming, it would have been better taste

if he had sent a note to say good-bye. And if you
consider that I had not an idea what to say to him !
and that I was in a state of mind all the time, saying
to myself, " Goodness gracious ! if papa should
suddenly walk round the corner, what should we all
do ? " I looked for papa every moment all the time.
People always do come if there is any special reason
for not wanting them. However, I hope it is allover
now, and that you will not expose us to such
risks any more.'

Anne made no reply to either of her companions.
She stole away from them as soon as possible, to
subdue the high beating of her own heart, and comedown
to the ordinary level. No, she was not likely
to encounter any such risks again ; the day was over
and with it the last cake of the feast : the black
bread of every day was all that now furnished forth
the tables. A kind of dull quiet fell upon Mount
and all the surrounding country. The clouds closed
round and hung low. People seemed to speak in
whispers. It was a quiet that whispered of fate, and
in which the elements of storm might be lurking.

But still it cannot be said that the calm was unhappy.
The light had left the landscape, but only for the
moment. The banquet was over, but there were fresh
feasts to come. Everything fell back into the old conditions,
but nothing was as it had been. The world
was the same, yet changed in every particular. Without
any convulsion, or indeed any great family disturbance,
bow did this happen unsuspected ? Everything
in heaven and earth was different, though all
things were the same.

CHAPTEK VII.

Cross-examination.

The 'change that is made in a quiet house in the
country when the chief source of life and emotion is
closed for one or other of the inhabitants is such a
thing as ' was never said in rhyme.' There may be
nothing tragical, nothing final about it, but it penetrates
through every hour and every occupation.
The whole scheme of living seems changed, although
there may be no change in any habit. It is, indeed,
the very sameness and unity of the life, the way in
which every little custom survives, in which the feet
follow the accustomed round, the eyes survey the
same things, the very same words come to the lips
that make the difference so palpable. This was
what Anne Montfort felt now. To outward seeming
her existence was absolutely as before. It was not an

exciting life, but it had been a Imply one. Her mind
was active and strong, and capable of sustaining
itself. Even in the warm and soft stagnation of her
home, her life had been like a running stream always
in movement, turning off at unexpected corners,
flowing now in one direction, now another, making
unexpected leaps and variations of its own. She
had the wholesome love of new things and employments
which keeps life fresh ; and there had scarcely
been a week in which she had not had some new idea
or other, quickly copied and turned into matter-of-fact
prose by her little sister. This had made Mount
lively even when there was nothing going on. And
for months together nothing did go on at Mount. It
was not a great country house filled with fashionable
visitors in the autumn and winter, swept clean of
all its inhabitants in spring. The Mountfords stayed
at home all the year round, unless it were at the fall
of the leaf, when sometimes they would go to Brighton,
sometimes at the very deadest season to town. They
had nobody to visit them except an occasional old friend
belonging to some other county family, who understood

the kind of life and lived the same at home. On these
occasions if the friend were a little superior they would
ask Lord and Lady Meadowlands to dinner, but if not
they would content themselves with the clergymen
of the two neighbouring parishes, and the Wood-heads,
whose house was not much more than a villa.
Lately, since the girls grew up, the ' game ' in the
afternoon which brought young visitors to the house
in summer had added to the mild amusements of this
life ; but the young people who came were always
the same, and so were the old people in the village,
who had to be visited, and to have flannels prepared
for them against Christmas, and their savings taken
care of. When a young man ' went wrong,' or a girl
got into trouble, it made the greatest excitement in
the parish. ' Did you hear that Sally Lawson came
home to her mother on Saturday, sent away from
her place at a moment's notice ? ' or : ' Old Grubbing's
boy has enlisted. Did you ever hear anything so sad
the one the rector took so much pains with, and
helped on so in his education ? ' It was very sad for
the Grubbing and Lawson, but it was a great godsend

to the parish. And when Lady Meadowlands'
mother, old Lady Prayray Poule, went and married,
actually married at sixty, it did the very county, not
to speak of those parishes which had the best right
to the news, good. This was the way in which life
passed at Mount. And hitherto Anne had supplemented
and made it lively with a hundred pursuits
of her own. Even up to the beginning of August,
when Mr. Douglas, who had left various reminiscences
behind him of his Christmas visit, came back  ha vino-enjoyed
himself so much on the previous occasion, ashe
said  Anne had continued in full career of those
vigorous fancies which kept her always interested.
She had sketched indefatigably all the spring and
early summer, growing almost fanatical about the
tenderness of the shadows and the glory of the lights.
Then finding the cottages, which were so picturesque,
and figured in so many sl etches, to be too wretched
for habitation, though they were inhabited, she had
rushed into building, into plans, and elevations, and
measurements, which it was difficult to force Mr.
Montfort's attention to, but which were evidently a .

step in the right direction. But on Douglas's second
arrival these occupations had been unconsciously
intermitted, they had been pushed aside by a hundred
little engagements which the Ashleyss had managed
to make for the entertainment of their friend , There
had been several pic-nics, and a party at the rectory
the first since Mrs. Ashley's death  and a party at
the Woodheads', the only other people in the parish
capable of entertaining. Then there had been an
expedition to the Castle, which the Meadowlands, on
being informed that Charley Ashley's friend was
anxious to see it, graciously combined with a luncheon
and a ' game ' in the afternoon. And then there
was the oame at Mount on all the other afternoons.
Who could wonder, as Mrs. Montfort said, that
something had come of it ? The young men had
been allowed to come continually about the house.
No questions had been asked, no conditions imposed
upon them. ' Thou shalt not make love to thy
entertainer's daughter ' had not been written up, as
it ought to have been, on the lodge. And now
all this was over. Like a scene at the theatre.

opening up, gliding off with nothing but a little jar
of the carpentry, this momentous episode was concluded
and the magician gone. And Anne Mount-ford
returned to the existence  which was exactly as
it had been of old.

The other people did not see any difference in it ;
and to her the wonderful thing was that there was no
difference in it. She had been in paradise, caught
up, and had seen unspeakable things ; but now that
she had dropped down again, though for a moment
the earth seemed to jar and tingle under her feet
as they came in contact with it, there was no
difference. Her plans were there just the same, and
the question still to settle about how far the pig-sty
must be distant from the house ; and old Saymore
re-emerged to view making up his bouquets for the
vases, and holding his head on one side as he looked
at them, to see how they ' composed ; ' and Mrs.
Worth, who all this time had been making dresses and
trying different shades to find out what would best
set off Miss Eose's complexion. They had been
going on like the figures on the barrel-organ, doing

VOL. I. K

the same thing all the time never varying or
changing. Anne looked at them all with a kind of
doleful amusement, gyrating just in the old way,
making the same little bobs and curtseys. They had
no want of interest or occupation, always moving
quite contentedly to the old tunes, turning round
and round. Mr. Montfort sat so many hours in
his business-room, walked one day, rode the next
for needful exercise, sat just so long in the drawing-room
in the evening. His wife occupied herself an
hour every morning with the cook, took her wool-work
at eleven, and her drive at half-past two,
except when the horses were wanted. Anne came
back to it all, with a little giddiness from her expedition
to the empyrean, and looked at the routine
with a wondering amusement. She had never known
before how like clockwork it was. Now her own
machinery, always a little eccentric, declined to
acknowledge that key: some sort of new motive
power had got into her, which disturbed the action
of the other. She began again with a great many
jerks and jars, a great many times : and then would

stop and look at all the others in their unconscious
dance, moving round and round, and laugh to herself
with a little awe of her discovery. Was this what
the scientific people meant by the automatic theory,
she wondered, being a young woman who read everything
; but then in a law which permitted no exceptions,
how was it that she herself had got out of
gear ?

Eose, who followed her sister in everything,
wished very much to follow her in this too. She
had always managed to find out about every new
impulse before, and catch the way of it, though the
impulse itself was unknown to her. She gave Anne
no rest till she had ascertained about this too. ' Tellus
what it is like,' she said, with a hundred repetitions.
' How did you first find out that he cared for
you ? What put it into your head ? Was it anything
he said that made you think that ? As it is
probably something that one time or another will
happen to me too, I think it is dreadful of you not
to tell me. Had you never found it out till he told
you ? and what did he say ? Did he ask you all at

K 2

once if you would marry him ? or did it all come on
by degrees ? '

How do you think I can tell ? ' said Anne ; ' it
is not a thing you can put into words. I think it all
came on by degrees.'

But this, though it was her own formula, did
not satisfy Eose. ' I am sure you could tell me a
great deal more if you only would,' she cried ; ' what
did he say ? Now, that you can't help remembering ;
you must know what he said. Did he tell you
he was in love with you, or ask you straight off to
marry him ? You can't have forgotten that  it is
not so very long ago.'

But, Eosie, I could not tell you. It is not the
words, it is not anything that could be repeated. A
woman should hear that for the first time,' said
Anne, with shy fervour, turning away her head to
hide the blush, ' when it is said to herself.'

A woman ! Then you call yourself a woman
now ? I am only a girl ; is that one of the things
that show ? ' asked Eose, gravely, in pursuit of her
inquiry. ' Well, then, you ought surely to let me

know what kind of a thing it is. Are you so very
fond of him as people say in books ? are you always
thinking about him ? Anne, it is dreadfully mean
of you to keep it all to yourself. Tell me one thing :
when he said it first, did he go down upon his
knees ? '

What nonsense you are talking ! ' said Anne,
with a burst of laughter. Then there rose before
her in sweet confusion a recollection of various
moments in which Eose, always matter-of-fact,
might have described her lover as on his knees.
 You don't know anything about it,' she said, ' and I
can't tell you anything about it. I don't know
myself, Rosie ; it was all like a dream,'

It is you who are talking nonsense,' said Rose.
How could it be like a dream ? In a dream you
wake up and it is all over ; but it is not a bit over
with you. Well, then, after, how did it feel, Anne ?
Was he always telling you you were pretty ? Did
he call you " dear," and " love," and all that sort of
thing ? It would be so very easy to tell me  and I
do so want to know.'

Do you remember. Rose,' said Anne, with a little
solemnity, ' how we used to wish for a brother ? We
thought we could tell him everything, and ask him
questions as we never could do to papa, and yet it
would be quite different from telling each other 
He would know better ; he would be able to tell us
quantities of things, and yet he would understand
what we meant too.'

I remember you used to wish for it,' said Rose,
honestly, ' and that it would have been such a very
good thing for the entail.'

Then,' said Anne, with fervour, it is a little like
that  like what we thought that would be. One
feels that one's heart is running over with things to
say. One wants to tell him everything, what
happened when one was a little girl, and all the
nonsense that has ever been in one's mind. I told
him even about that time I was shut up in the blue
room, and how frightened I was. Everything ! it
does not matter if it is a trifle. One knows he will
not think it a trifle. Exactly  at least almost exactly,
like what it would be to have a brother  but yet

with a difference too,' Anne added, after a pause,
blushing, she could scarcely tell why.

Ah ! ' said Eose, with great perspicacity, ' but
the difference is just what I want to know.'

The oracle, however, made no response, and in
despair the pertinacious questioner changed the
subject a little. ' If you will not tell me what he
said, nor what sort of a thing it is, you may at least
let me know one thing  what are you going to do ? '

'Nothing,' said Anne, softly. She stood with
her hands clasped before her, looking with some
wistfulness into the blueness of the distant air, as if
into the future, shaking her head a little, acknowledging
to herself that she could not see into it.
Nothing  so far as I know.'

Nothing ! are you going to be in love, and
engaged, and all that, and yet do nothing f I know
papa will not consent  mamma told me. She said
you would have to give up everything if you married
him ; and that it would be a good thing for '

Here Rose paused, gave her head a little shake
to banish the foolish words with which she had

almost betrayed the confidence of her mother's communication,
and reddened with alarm to think how
near she had been to letting it all out.

I am not going to marry,' said Anne, in

spite of herself, a little coldly, though she scarcely
knew why, ' if that is what you want to know.'

Then what,' said Rose, majestically, ' do you
mean to do ? '

The elder sister laughed a little. It was at the
serious pertinacity of her questioner, who would not
take an answer. ' I never knew you so curious
before,' she said. ' One does not need to do anything
all at once '

But what are you going to do ? ' said Eose. ' I
never knew you so dull, Anne. Dear me, there area
great many things to do besides getting married.
Has he just gone away for good, and is there an end
of it ? Or is he coming back again, or going to
write to you, or what is going to happen ? I know
it can't be going to end like that ; or what was the
use of it at all ? ' the girl said, with some indignation.
It was Rose's office to turn into prose all

Anne's romancing. She stopped short as they were
walking, in the heat of indignant reason, and faced
her sister, with natural eloquence, as all oratorical
talkers do.

It is not going to end,' said Anne, a shade of
sternness coming over her face. She did not pause
even for a moment, but went on softly with her
abstracted look. Many a time before in the same
abstraction had she escaped from her sister's questions
; but Eose had never been so persistent as now.

If you are not going to do anything, and it is not
to end, I wonder what is going to happen,' said Eose.
If it were me, I should know what I was to do.'

They were walking up and down on the green
terrace where so many games had been played. It
was getting almost too dark for the lime avenue
when their talk had begun. The day had faded sofar
that the red of the geraniums had almost gone
out; and light had come into the windows of the
drawing-room, and appeared here and there over the
house. The season had changed all in a day  a
touch of autumn was in the air, and mist hung in

all the hollows. The glory of the year was over ; or
so at least Anne thought.

And another thing,' said Eose ; ' are you going
to tell anybody ? Mamma says I am not to tell ;
but do you think it is right to go to the Meadow-lands'
party, and go on talking and laughing with
everybody just the same, and you an engaged girl?
Somebody else might fall in love with you ! I don't
think it is a right thing to do.'

People have not been in such a hurry to fall in
love with me said Anne ; ' but. Rose, I don't think
this is a subject that mamma would think at all
suited for you.'

Oh, mamma talked to me about it herself; she
said she wished you would give it up, Anne. She
said it never could come to anything, for papa will
never consent.'

'Papa may never consent; but yet it will come
to something,' said Anne, with a gleam in her eyes.
That is enough, Rose ; that is enough. I am going
in, whatever you may do.'

But, Anne ! just one thing more ; if papa does

not consent, what can you do? Mamma says he
could never afford to marry if you had nothing, and
you would have nothing if papa refused. It is only
your money that you would have to marry on ; and

if you had no money So what could you do ? '

I wish, when mamma speaks of my affairs, she
would speak to me,' said Anne, with natural indignation.
She was angry and indignant ; and the
words made, in spite of herself, a painful commotion
within her. Money ! what had money to do with
it ? She had felt the injustice, the wrong of her
father's threat ; but it had not occurred to her that
this could really have any effect upon her love ; and
though she had been annoyed to find that Cosmo
would not treat the subject with seriousness, or
believe in the gravity of Mr. Montfort's menace,
still she had been entirely satisfied that his apparent
carelessness was the right way for him to consider it.
He thought it of no importance, of course. He
made jokes about it; laughed at it; beguiled her
out of her gravity on the subject. Of course ! what
was it to him whether she was rich or poor ; what

did Cosmo care ? So long as she loved him, was not
that all he was thinking of ? What would she have
minded had she been told that he had nothing ?
Not one straw  not one farthing ! But when this
little prose personage, with her more practical views
of the question, rubbed against Anne, there did come
to her, quite suddenly, a little enlightenment. It was
like one chill, but by no means depressing, ray of daylight
bursting in through a crevice into the land of
dreams. If he had no money, and she no money,
what then ? Then, notwithstanding all generosity
and nobleness of affection, money certainly would
have something to do with it. It would count
among the things to be taken into consideration ;
count dolefully, in so far as it would keep them
apart ; yet count with stimulating force as a difficulty
to be surmounted, an obstacle to be got the
better of. When Mrs. Montfort put her head out
of the window, and called them to come in out of the
falling dews, Anne went upstairs very seriously, and
shut the door of her room, and sat down in her
favourite chair to think it out. Fathers and mothers

are supposed to have an objection to long engagements
; but girls, at all events at the outset of their
career, do not entertain the same objection. Anne
was still in the dreamy condition of youthful rapture,
transported out of herself by the new light
that had come into the world, so that the indispensable
sequence of marriage did not present itself to
her as it does to the practical-minded. It was a
barrier of fact with which, in the meantime, she had
nothing to do. She was not disappointed or depressed,
because that was not the matter in question.
It would come in time, no doubt, as the afternoon
follows the morning, and autumn summer, but who
would change the delights of the morning for the
warmer, steady glory of three o'clock ? though that
also is very good in its way. She was quite resigned
to the necessity of waiting, and not being married
all at once. The contingency neither alarmed nor
distressed her. Its immediate result was one which,
indeed, most courses of thought produced in her
mind at the present moment. If I had but thought
of that, she said to herself, before he went away ! She

would have liked to talk over the money question
with Cosmo ; to discuss it in all its bearings ; to
hear him say how little it mattered, and to plan
how they could do without it ; not absolutely without
it, of course ; but Anne's active mind leaped at
once at the thought of those systems of domestic
economy which would be something quite new to
study, which had not yet tempted her, but which
would now have an interest such as no study ever
had. And, on his side, there could be no doubt that
the effort would be similar ; in all likelihood even
now (if he had thought of it) ht was returning with
enthusiasm to his work, saying to himself, ' I have
Anne to work for; I have my happiness to win.'
He could never afford to marry if you had nothing.
It is only your money that you could marry on ; and
if you had no money, what could you do ? ' Anne
smiled to herself at Rose's wisdom ; nay, laughed
in the silence, in the dark, all by herself, with an
outburst of private mirth. Rose  prose, she said to
herself, as she had said often before. How little
that little thing knew I but how could she know any

better, being so young, and with no experience ?
The thrill of high exhilaration which had come to
her ovn breast at the thought of this unperceived
difficulty  the still higher impulse that no doubt
had been given to Cosmo, putting spurs to his intellect,
making impossibilities possible  a child like
Eose could not understand those mysteries. By-and-by
Anne reminded herself that, as the love of
money was the root of all evil, so the want of it had
been, not only no harm, bat the greatest good.
Painters, poets, people of genius of every kind had
been stimulated by this wholesome prick. Had
Shakespeare been rich ? She threw her head aloft
with a smile of conscious energy, and capacity, and
power. No money ! That would be the best way to
make a life worth living. She faced all heroism,
all sacrifices, with a smile, and in a moment had
gone through all the labours and privations of years.
He, working so many hours at a stretch, bursting upon
the world with the eloquence which was inspired by
love and necessity ; she, making a shabby room into
a paradise of content, working for him with her own

happy hands, carrying him through every despondency
and difficulty. Grood heavens ! could any little
idiot suppose that to settle down on a good income and
never have any trouble would be half so delightful
as this ? Anne used strong language in the swelling
of her breast.

It made her laugh with a little ridicule of herself,
and a half sense that, if Eose's tendency was
prose, hers might perhaps be heroics, when it occured
to her that Cosmo, instead of rushing back to
his work, had only intended to catch the Scotch
mail, and that he was going to the Highlands to
shoot ; while she herself was expected in Mrs.
Worth's room to have her dress tried on for the
Meadowlands' party. But, after all, what did that
matter ? There was no hurry ; it was still the Long
Vacation, in which no man can work, and in the
meantime there was no economy for her to begin
upon.

The maid whom she and Rose shared between
them, and whose name was Keziah, came to the door
to call her when she had reached this point.

Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Anne,' she said, ' I
didn't know you had no lights.'

They were quite unnecessary, thank you,' said
Anne, rising up out of her meditations, calmed, yet
with all the force of this new stimulus to her
thoughts.

YOL. I.

CHAPTER VIII.

THE Headlands' PARTY.

It was a very large party  collected from all the
quarters of England, or even it may be said of the
globe, seeing there was a Russian princess and an
American literary gentleman among the lists of the
guests, as well as embracing the whole county, and
everybody that had any claim to be affiliated into
society there. Lady Meadowlands made a very
liberal estimate of what could be called the society
of the county  too liberal an estimate, many people
thought. The clergy, everyone knows, must be
present in force at every such function, and all their
belongings, down to the youngest daughter who is
out ; but such a rule surely ought not to apply to
country practitioners ; and even to the brewer at
Hunston, who, though he was rich, was nobody

Upon that point almost everybody made a stand, and
it is to be feared that Mrs. and Miss Brewer did not
enjoy themselves at the Castle. But these were
drawbacks not fully realised till afterwards. The
people who were aggrieved by the presence of the
brewer's family were those who themselves were not
very sure of their standing, and who felt it was ' no
compliment ' to be asked when such persons were also
acknowledged as within the mystic ring. Dr. Peacock's
wife and Miss Woodhead were the ladies who
felt it most ; though poor Mr. Peacock himself was
considered by some to be quite as great a blot. All
the roads in the neighbourhood of the Castle were as
gay as if there had been a fair going on. The village
turned out bodily to see the carriages and horses of
the quality ; though these fine people themselves were
perhaps less admired by the rustics than the
beautiful tall footman in powder who had come from
town with Lady Pray ray Poule. But as every new
arrival drove up, the excitement rose to a high
pitch ; even the soberest of people are moved by the
sensation of multitude, the feeling of forming part of
L 2

a distinguished crowd. And the day was fine, with
a sunny haze hanging about the distance, reddening
the sun and giving a warm indistinctness to the sky.
The grounds at Meadowlands were fine, and the park
very extensive. The house was a modern and handsome
house, and at some distance from it stood an
old castle in ruins, which was the greatest attraction
of the place. Upon the lawns a great many ' games '
were going on. I have already said that I have no
certainty as to whether the games were croquet or
lawn-tennis, not knowing or remembering when the
one period ended and the other began. But they
were enough in either case to supply lively groups of
young persons in pretty dresses, and afford a little
gentle amusement to the lookers-on, especially when
those lookers-on were the parents or relations of the
performers. The Montfort party held a half-way
place in the hierarchy of Lady Meadowlands' guests.
They were, as has been said, a very old family, though
their want of wealth had for some time made them
less desirable neighbours than it is pleasant for
members of an old family to be. And though the

girls might, as was generally said, now ' marry anybody,'
and consequently rise to any distinction, Mr.
and Mrs. Montfort were not the kind of people
whom it would have afforded the Princess Comatosky
any pleasure to have presented to her, or who would
have been looked upon as fine types of the English
landed gentry by Mr. Grreenwood, the American.
But, on the other hand, they occupied a position
very different from that of the rank and file, the
people who, but for their professional position, would
have had no right to appear in the heaven of county
society at all. And Anne and Rose being pretty, and
having the hope, one of a very good fortune, the other
of a reasonable dot were really in the first rank of
young ladies without any drawbacks at all. Perhaps
the reader will like to know what they wore on this
interesting occasion. They were not dressed
alike, as sisters so often are, without regard to
individuality. After very serious thought, Mrs.
Worth had decided that the roses of Rose wanted
subduing, and had dressed her in Tussle silk, of the
warm natural grass colour ; while Anne, always much

more easy to dress, as that artist said, was in an ivory-tinted
cashmere, very plain and simple, which did all
that was wanted for her slim and graceful figure.
Eose had flouncelets and puffing beyond mortal power
to record. Anne was better without the foreign aid
of ornament. I don't pretend to be so uninstructed
as to require to describe a lady's dress as only of
some soft white material.' It was cashmere, and
why shouldn't one say so ? For by this time a
little autumn chill had set in, and even in the
middle of the day it was no longer overpoweringly
warm.

It is needless to say that the Ashleyss were also
there. These young men, though so constantly with
the girls at home, had to relinquish their place a
little when abroad, and especially when in more
exalted company. Then it became apparent that
Charley and Willie, though great friends, were not in
any way of the same importance as Anne and Eose.
They were not handsome, for one thing, or very clever
or amusing  but only Charley and Willie Ashley,
which was a title for friendship, but not for social

advancement. And especially were they separated
from Anne, whose climax of social advancement
came when she was presented to the Princess ,
who admired her eyes and her dress, the latter
being a most unusual compliment. There was a
fashionable party assembled in the house besides all
the county people, and the Miss Mountfords were
swept away into this brilliant sphere and introduced
to everybody. Eose was a little abashed at first, and
looked back with anxious eyes at her mother, who
was seated on the edge of that higher circle, but not
within it ; but she soon got confidence. Anne, however,
who was not so self-possessed, was excited by
the fine company. Her complexion, which was
generally pale, took a faint glow, her eyes became so
bright that the old Russian lady grew quite enthusiastic.
' I like a handsome girl,' she said ; ' bring
her back once more to speak to me.' Mr. Greenwood,
the American, was of the same opinion. He was not
at all like the American author of twenty years ago,
before we knew the species. He spoke as little
through his nose as the best of us, and his manners

were admirable. He was more resignedly English
than an Englishman, more fastidious in his opposition
to display and vulgarity, and his horror of loud tones
and talk ; and there was just a nuance of French
politeness in his look and air. He was as exquisitely
polite to the merest commoner as if he had been a
crowned head, but at the same time it was one of
the deepest certainties of his heart that he was only
quite at home among people of title and in a noble
house. Not all people of title : Mr. Grreenwood had
the finest discrimination and preferred at all times
the best.' But even he was pleased with Anne.
Miss Montfort is very inexperienced,' he said, in
his gentle way ; ' she does not know how to drop into
a conversation or to drop out of it. Perhaps that is
too fine an art to learn at twenty : but she is more
like a lady than anyone else I see here.' Lady
Meadowlands, like most of the fashionable world, had
a great respect for Mr. Grreenwood's opinion. ' That
is so much from you ! ' she said gratefully ; ' and if
you give her the advantage of seeing a little of you,
it will do dear Anne the greatest good.' Mr. Greenwood

shook his head modestly, deprecating the possibility
of conferring so much advantage, but he felt in
his heart that it was true.

Thus Anne, for the first time in her life, had
what may be called a veritable success. We may
perhaps consider the word naturalised by this time
and call it a success. There was a certain expansion
and brightening of all her faculties consequent upon
the new step she had taken in life, of which no one
had been conscious before, and the state of opposition
in which she found herself to her family had
given her just as much emancipation as became her,
and gave force to ail her attractions. She was not
beautiful perhaps, nor would she have satisfied a
critical examination ; but both her face and figure
had a certain nobility of line which impressed the
spectator. Tall and light, and straight and strong,
with nothing feeble or drooping about her, the
girlish shyness to which she had been subject was
not becoming to Anne. Rose, who was not shy,
might have drooped her head as much as she pleased,
but it did not suit her sister. And the fact that she

had judged for herself, had chosen her own path,
and made up her own mind, and more or less defied
Fate and her father, had given just the inspiration
it wanted to her face. She was shy still, which gave
her a light and shade, an occasional gleam of timidity
and alarm, which pleased the imagination. ' I told
you Anne Montfort would come out if she had the
chance,' Lady Meadowlands said to her lord. ' What
is this nonsense I hear about an engagement? Is
there an engagement ? What folly ! before she has
seen anybody or had any chance, as you say,' said
Lord Meadowlands to his lady. They were interested
in Anne, and she was beyond question the girl who
did them most credit of all their country neighbours,
which also told for something in its way.

The Eev. Charles Ashley, in his most correct
clerical coat, and a general starch of propriety about
him altogether unlike the ease of his ordinary
appearance, looked on from afar at this brilliant
spectacle, but had not much share in it. Had there
been anybody there who could have been specially
 of use to Charley  the new bishop for instance, who

did not yet know his clergy, or the patron of a good
living, or an official concerned with the Crown
patronage, anyone who could have lent him a helping
hand in his profession  no doubt Lady Meadowlands
would have taken care to introduce the curate and
speak a good word for him. But there being nobody
of the kind present, Charley was left with the mob
to get up a game on his own account and amuse the
young ladies who were unimportant, who made up
the mass of the assembly. And the young Ashleyss
both accepted this natural post, and paid such
harmless attentions as were natural to the wives and
daughters of other clergymen, and the other people
whom they knew. They had no desire to be introduced
to the Princess, or the other great persons
who kept together, not knowing the county. But,
while Willie threw himself with zeal into the amusements
and the company provided, the curate kept
his eyes upon the one figure, always at a distance,
"which was the chief point of interest for him.

I want to speak to Anne,' he said to Eose, who
as less inaccessible, who had not had so great a

success ; ' if you see Anne, will you tell her I want
to speak to her ? '

Anne, Charley wants to speak to you,' Eose
said, as soon as she had an opportunity, in the
hearing of everybody ; and Anne turned and nodded
with friendly assent over the chairs of the old ladies.
But she did not make any haste to ask what he
wanted. She took it with great ease, as not calling
for any special attention. There would be abundant
opportunities of hearing what Charley had to say.
On the way home she could ask him what he wanted *
or while they were waiting for the carriage ; or even
tomorrow, when he was sure to come to talk over
the party, would no doubt be time enough. It
would be something about the schools, or some girl
or boy who wanted a place, or some old woman who
was ill.  Anne, Charley says he must speak to you,*
said Eose again. But it was not till after she had
received a third message that Anne really gave any
attention to the call. ' Cannot he tell you what he
wants?  I will come as soon as I can,' she said.
Perhaps the curate was not so much distressed as he

thought he was by her inattention. He watched
her from a distance with his hands in his pockets.
When he was accosted by other clergymen and
country friends who were wandering about he replied
to them, and even carried on little conversations
with his eyes upon her. Something grim and
humorous, a kind of tender spitefulness, was in the
look with which he regarded her. If she only knew !
But it was her own fault if she did not know, not
his. It gave him a kind of pleasure to see how she
lingered, to perceive that her mind was fully occupied,
and that she never divined the nature of his
business with her. So far as his own action went he
had done his duty, but he could not help a half
chuckle, quickly suppressed, when he imagined
within himself how Douglas would look if he saw
how impossible it was to gain Anne's attention. Did
that mean, he asked in spite of himself, that after
all she was not so much interested ? Charley had
felt sure that at the first word Anne would divine.
/ should divine if a note of hers was on its way tome,'
he said to himself  and it pleased him that she

never guessed that a letter from Cosmo was lying
safe in the recesses of his pocket. When she came
hastily towards him at last, a little breathless and
hurried, and with only a moment to spare, there was
no consciousness in Anne's face.

What is it ? ' she said  before the Woodheads I
She would have said it before anybody, so entirely
unsuspicious was she. ' I must go back to the old
lady,' she added, with a little blush and smile,
pleased in spite of herself by the distinction ; ' but
Eose told me you wanted me. Tell me what it is.'

He made elaborate signs to her with his eyebrows,
and motions recommending precaution with
his lips  confounding Anne completely. For poor
Charley had heavy eyebrows, and thick lips, and his
gestures were not graceful. She stared at him in
unfeigned astonishment, and then, amused as well
as bewildered, laughed. He enjoyed it all, though
he pretended to be disconcerted. She looked as
bright as ever, he said to himself. There was no
appearance of trouble about her, or of longing uncertainty.
She laughed just as of old, with that

pleasant ring in the laughter which had always
charmed him. The temptation crossed the curate's
mind, as she did not seem to want it, as she looked
so much like her old self, as she showed no perception
of what he had for her, to put the letter down
a little deeper in his pocket, and not disturb her
calm at all.

Oh yes,' he said, as if he had suddenly recollected,
' it was something I wanted to show you.
Come down this path a little. You seem to be
enjoying the party, Anne.'

'Yes, well enough. It is pretty,' she said,
glancing over the pretty lawns covered with gaily-dressed
groups. 'Are you not enjoying yourself?
I am so sorry. But you know everybody, or almost
everybody here.'

Except your grand people,' he said, with some
malice.

My grand people ! They are all nice whether
they are grand or not, and the old lady is very funny.
She has all kinds of strange old ornaments and
crosses and charms mixed together. What is it.

Charley ? you are looking so serious, and I must go
back as soon as I am able. Tell me what it is.'

Can't you divine what it is ? ' he said, with an
air half reproachful, half triumphant.

She looked at him astonished ; and then, suddenly
taking fire from his look, her face kindled
into colour and expectation and wondering eagerness.
Poor curate ! he had been pleased with her slowness
to perceive, but he was not so pleased now when her
whole countenance lighted under his eyes. He in
his own person could never have brought any such
light into her face. She opened her mouth as if to
speak, then stood eager, facing him with the words
arrested on her very lips.

Is it a message from ' She paused, and

a wave of scarlet came over her face up to her hair.
Poor Charley Ashley! There was no want of the
power to divine now. His little pleasant spitefulness,
and his elation over what he considered her
indifference, died in the twinkling of an eye.

It is more than a message,' he said, thinking
what an ass he was to doubt her, and what a traitor

to be delighted by that doubt. * It is  a letter,
Anne.'

She did not say anything  the colour grew
deeper and deeper upon her face, the breath came
quickly from her parted lips, and without a word
she put out her hand.

Yes, of course, that was all  to give it her, and
be done with it  what had he to do more with the
incident ? No honourable man would have wished
to know more. To give it to her and to withdraw.
It was nothing to him what was in the letter. He
had no right to criticise. In the little bitterness
which this feeling produced in him he wanted ta
say what, indeed, he had felt all along ; that though
he did not mind once it would not suit his office to
be the channel through which their communications
were to flow. He hunted to say this now, whereas
before he had only felt that he ought to say it ; butin
either case, under the look of Anne's eyes, poor
Charley could not say it. He put his hand in his
pocket to get the letter, and of course he forgot in
which [pocket he had put it, and then became red

VOL. I. M

and confused, as was natural. Anne for her part did
not change her attitude. She stood with that look
of sudden eagerness in her face  a blush that went
away, leaving her quite pale, and then came back
again and her hand held out for the letter. How
hot, how wretched he got, as he plunged into one
pocket after another, with her eyes looking him
through ! ' Anne,' he stammered, when he found it
at last, * I beg your pardon  I am very glad  to be
of  any use. I like to do anything, anything for

you ! but  I am a clergyman '

Oh, go away  please go away,' said Anne. She
had evidently paid no attention to what he said.
She put him away even, unconsciously, with her
hand. ' Don't let anyone come,' she said, walking
away from him round the next corner of the path.
Then he heard her tear open the envelope. She
had not paid any attention to his offer of service,
but she had made use of it all the same, taking it
for granted. The curate turned his back to her and
walked a few steps in the other direction. She had
told him not to let anyone come, and he would

not let anyone come. He would have walked any
intruders backward out of the sacred seclusion. Yet
there he stood dumb foundered, wounded, wondering
why it was that Cosmo should have so much power
and he so little. Cosmo got everything he wanted.
To think that Anne's face should change like that at
his mere name, nay, at the merest suggestion of him !
it was wonderful. But it was hard too.

Anne's heart was in her mouth as she read the
letter. She did not take time to think about it, nor
how it came there, nor of any unsuitableness in the
way it reached her. It was to ask how they were to
correspond, whether he was to be permitted to write
to her. ' I cannot think why we did not settle this
before I left,' Cosmo said; 'I suppose the going
away looked so like dying that nothing beyond it,
except coming back again, seemed any alleviation.'
But this object of the letter did not strike Anne at
first. She was unconscious of everything except the
letter itself, and those words which she had never
seen on paper in handwriting before. She had read
something like it in books. Nothing but books

M 2

could be the parallel of what was happening to her,
My dear and only love,' that was in a poem somewhere
Anne was certain, but Cosmo did not quote
it out of any poem. It was the natural language ;
that was how she was to be addressed now, like
Juliet. She had come to that state and dignity all
at once, in a moment, without any doing of hers.
She stood alone, unseen, behind the great tuft of
bushes, while the curate kept watch lest anyone
should come to disturb her, and all the old people
sat round unseen, chatting and eating ices, while
the young ones fluttered about the lawns. Nobody
suspected with what a sudden, intense, and wondering
perception of all the emotions she had fallen heir
to, she stood under the shadow of the rhododendrons
reading her letter ; and nobody knew with what a
sore but faithful heart the curate stood, turning his
back to her, and protected her seclusion. It was a
scene that was laughable, comical, pathetic, but
pathetic more than all.

This incident coloured the whole scene to Anne,
and gave it its character. She had almost forgotten

the very existence of the old Princess when she went
back. ' Bring me that girl,' the old lady said, in
her excellent English, ' bring me back that girl.
She is the one I prefer. All the others they are
demoiselles, but this is a woman.' But when Anne
was brought back at last the keen old lady saw the
difference at once. ' Something has happened,' she
said : ' what has happened, my all-beautiful ? someone
has been making you a proposal of marriage.
That comes of your English customs which you
approve so much. To me it is intolerable ; imagine
a man having the permission in society to startle
this child with an emotion like that.' She pronounced
emotion and all similar words as if they
had been in the French language. Anne protested
vainly that no such emotion had fallen to her share.
Mr. Greenwood agreed with the Princess, though he
did not express himself so frankly. Could it be the
curate? he thought, elevating his eyebrows. He
was a man of experience, and knew how the most
unlikely being is sometimes gifted to produce such
an emotion in the fairest bosom.

CHAPTEK IX.

COSMO.

It is time to let the reader of this story know who
Cosmo Douglas was, whose appearance had made so
great a commotion at Mount. He was  nobody.
This was a fact that Mr. Montfort had very soon
elicited by his inquiries. He did not belong to any
known house of Douglasseses under the sun. It maybe
said that there was something fair in Cosmo's
frank confession on this point, put perhaps it would
be more true to say that it showed the good sense
which was certainly one of his characteristics ; for
any delusion that he might have encouraged or consented
to in this respect must have been found out
very shortly, and it would only have been to his
discredit to claim good connections which did not
belong to him. ' Honesty is the best policy ' he had

said to himself, and therefore he had been honest
Nevertheless it was a standing mystery to Cosmo
that he was nobody. He could not understand it.
It had been a trouble to him all his life. How was
he inferior to the other people who had good connections
? He had received the same kind of education,
he had the same kind of habits, he was as
much a ' gentleman,' that curious English distinction
which means everything and nothing, as any of
them. He did not even feel within himself the
healthy thrill of opposition with which the lowly
born sometimes scorn the supposed superiority of
blue blood. He for his part had something in his
heart which entirely coincided with that superstition.
Instinctively he preferred for himself that his friends
should be well born. He had as natural a predilection
that way as if his shield held ever so many
quart brings ; and it was terrible to know that he had
no right to any shield at all. In his boyhood he had
accepted the crest which his father wore at his watch-chain,
and had stamped upon his spoons and forks,
with undoubting faith, as if it had descended straight

from the Crusaders ; and when he had read of the
dark grey man ' in early Scotch history, and of that
Lord James who carried Bruce's heart to the Holy
Land, there was a swell of pride within him, and he
had no doubt that they were his ancestors. But ashe
grew older it dawned upon Cosmo that his father
had assumed the bleeding heart because he found it
represented in the old book of heraldry as the cognisance
of the Douglasseses, and not because he had
any hereditary right to it  and, indeed, the fact was
that good Mr. Douglas knew no better. He thought
in all simplicity that his name entitled him to the
symbol which was connected with the name, and
that all those great people so far off from the present
day were ' no doubt ' his ancestors, though it was too
far back to be able to tell.

Mr. Douglas himself was a man of the highest
respectability. He was the managing clerk in a
solicitor's office, with a good salary, and the entire
confidence of his employers. Perhaps he might
even have been a partner had he been of a bolder
temper ; but he was afraid of responsibility, and had

no desire, he said, to assume a different position, or
rise in the social scale. That would be for Cosmo,
he added, within himself. He had lost his wife at a
very early period, when Cosmo was still a child, and
upon the boy all his father's hopes were built. He
gave him * every advantage.' For himself he lived
very quietly in a house with a garden out Hampstead
way, a small house capable of being managed by one
respectable woman-servant, who had been with him
for years, and a young girl under her, or sometimes
a boy, when she could be persuaded to put up with
one of these more objectionable creatures. But
Cosmo had everything that was supposed to be best
for an English young man. He was at Westminster
School, and so received into the fraternity of ' public
school men,' which is a distinct class in England ;
and then he went to the University. When he took
his degree he studied for the bar. Both at Oxford
and Lincoln's Inn he was ' in for ' all his examinations
in company with the son of his father's employer
; but it was Cosmo who was the most promising
student always, and the most popular man. He

had the air and the bearing, the ' je ne spain quoi'
which is supposed to indicate ' family,' though he
was of no family. Nothing ever was more perplexing.
He could not understand it himself. What was it
that made this wonderful difference? When he
looked at Charley Ashley a smile would sometimes
steal over his countenance. In that point of view
the prejudice certainly showed its full absurdity.
Charley was his retainer, his faithful follower  his
dog, in a way. But Mr. Montfort, though he
would probably have thought Charley not a suitable
match for his daughter, would not have looked upon
him with the same puzzled air as on a creature of a
different species, with which he regarded the suitor
who was nobody. When this contrast struck him, no
doubt Cosmo smiled with a little bitterness. Charley
had connections among all the little squires of the
district. He had an uncle here and there whose
name was in some undistinguished list or other  the
Gentry of Great Britain ' or some other such beadroll.
But Cosmo had no link at all to the classes who
consider themselves the natural masters of the world.

If you will think of it, it was as troublesome and
unpleasant a position as could be conceived  to have
all that makes a gentleman and to be a gentleman,
fully considered and received as such, yet upon close
investigation to be found to be nobody, and have all
your other qualities ignored in consequence. It was
hard  it was a complicating, perplexing grievance,
such as could only occur in the most artificial state
of society. In the middle ages, if a man ' rose,' it
was by dint of hard blows, and people were afraid of
him. But ' rising in the world ' had a very different
meaning in Cosmo's case. He had always known
what it was to be carefully tended, daintily fed,
clothed with the best of clothes  as well as a duke's
son need have been. He had all the books to read
which any duke's son could have set his face to ; and
though the Hampstead rooms were small, and might
have looked poky had there been a family cooped
up in them, Cosmo and his father had felt no want
of space nor of comfort. Even that little Hampstead
house was now a thing of the past. Mr.
Douglas had died, though still not much beyond

middle age, and Cosmo lead his chambers, like any
other young barrister, and several clubs, and all the
advantages ' which his father had sworn he should
have. He had a little money, and a little practice,
and was 'getting on.' If he was not in fashionable
society, he was yet in an excellent ' set '  rising barristers,
literary people, all rising too, people of reputation,
people who suppose themselves to sway the
world, and who certainly direct a great deal of its
public talk, and carry a large silent background
of its population with them. He was very well
thought of among this class, went out a great deal
into society, knew a great many people whom it is
supposed something to know  and yet he was nobody.
The merest clown could have confused him
at any time by asking, ' Which is your county,
Douglas ? ' Poor Cosmo had no county. He took
the deficiency admirably, it is needless to say, and
never shirked the truth when there was any need to
tell it. In the majority of cases it was not at all
necessary to tell it ; but yet his friends knew well
enough that he had no relations to give him shooting,

or ask him during the hunting season ; no district had
any claim upon him, nor he upon it. A man may love
his home when it has never been anywhere but in
Hampstead. But it makes a great difference  even
when his friends make up the deficiencies of family
to him, and invite him, as he had this year been
invited, to share the delights of a Scotch moor 
still it makes a great difference. And when it is a
matter of matrimony, and of producing his proofs
of gentility, and of being a fit person to marry
Anne Montfort, then the difference shows most
of all

When Cosmo attained that perfect freedom from
all ties, and power of roaming wherever he pleased,
without any clog to draw him back, which was involved
in his father's death (though it may be said
for him that this was an event which he deeply
regretted) he made up his mind that he would not
marry, at least until he had reached sufficient distinction
in his profession to make him somebody,
quite independent of connections. But then he had
not seen Anne Montfort. With her, without any

secondary motives, he had fallen honestly and
heartily in love, a love which he would, however, have
managed to quench and get the better of, had it not
turned out upon inquiry that Anne was one whom it
was entirely permissible to love, and who could help
him, not hold him back in the career of success.
He had, however, many discussions with himself
before he permitted himself to indulge his inclinations.
He had felt that with people like the Mountfords
the fact that he was nobody would tell with
double power ; and, indeed, if he had ever been
tempted to invent a family of Douglasseses of ,
it was now. He had almost been
led into doing this. He had even half-prepared a
little romance, which no doubt Mr. Montfort, he
thought, would have swallowed, of a ruined house
dwindled away to its last representative, which had
lost lands and even name in one of the rebellions.
He had not chosen which rebellion, but he had
made up the story otherwise with great enjoyment
and a fine sense of its fitness : when that modern
quality, which for want of a better name we call a

sense of humour stopped him. For a man of his time,
a man of his enlightened opinions, a member of a
liberal profession, a high-bred (if not high-born)
Englishman to seek importance from a silly little
school-girl romance was too absurd. He could not
do it. He laughed aloud at himself with a little
flush of shame on his countenance, and tossed away
the fiction. But what a thing it would have been
for Cosmo if the tumbledown old house which he
had invented and the bit of school-girl fiction had
been true ! They became almost such to him, so
strongly did he feel that they would exactly fit his
case. ' They would have been as stupid probably
as  Mr. Montfort,' Cosmo said to himself, ' and
pig-headed into the bargain, or they never would
have thrown away everything for a gingerbread
adventurer like Prince Charley  rude Lowland
rustics talking broad Scotch, not even endowed
with the mystery of Gaelic. But to be sure I might
have made them Celts, and the Lord of Mount would
not have been a whit the wiser. I think I can see
a snuffy old laird in a blue bonnet, and a lumbering

young lout scratching his red head. And these be your
gods, oh Israel! I don't think I should have been
niuch the better of such ancestors.' But nevertheless
he felt in his heart that he would have been
much the better for them. Other men might despise
them, but Cosmo would have liked to believe in
those Douglasseses who had never existed. However,
though he had invented them, he could not make
use of them. It would have been too absurd. He
laughed and reddened a little, and let them drop ;
and with a perfectly open and composed countenance
informed Mr. Montfort that he was nobody and
sprang from no known Douglasseses at all. It was a
kind of heroism in its way, the heroism of good
sense, the influence of that wholesome horror of the
ridiculous which is one of the strongest agencies of
modern life.

After the interview with Mr. Montfort, and after
the still greater shock of Anne's intimation that her
father would not yield, Cosmo's mind had been much
exercised, and there had been a moment in which he
had not known what to do or say. Marriage without

pecuniary advantage was impossible to him  he
could not, he dared not think of it. It meant
downfall of every kind, and a narrowing of all the
possibilities of life. It would be ruin to him and
also to the girl who should be his wife. It would be
impossible for him to keep her in the position she
belonged to, and he would have to relinquish the
position which belonged to him  two things not fora
moment to be thought of. The only thing possible,
evidently, was to wait. He was in love, but he was
not anxious to marry at once. In any case it would
be expedient to defer that event ; and the old man
might die  nay, most likely would die  and would
not certainly change his will if all things were kept
quiet and no demonstration made. He left Mount
full of suppressed excitement, yet glad to be able to
withdraw ; to go away without compromising Anne,
without being called upon to confront or defy the
harsh parent, or do anything to commit himself.
If Anne but held her tongue, there was no reason
wliy Mr. Montfort might not suppose that she had
given Cosmo up, and Cosmo was rather pleased than
nol. I. N

otherwise with the idea that she might do ,so. He
wanted no sentimental passion; no sacrifice of
everything for his sake. All for love and the world
well lost, was not in the least a sentiment which
commended itself to him. He would have much
preferred that she had dissembled altogether, and
put on an appearance of obeying her father; but
this was a thing that he could not recommend her todo,
any more than he could put forth his invented
story of the ruined Douglasseses. The fashion of his
age and his kind and his education was so against
lying, that it could be practised only individually,
so to speak, and as it were accidentally. You might
be betrayed into it by the emergency of a moment,
but you could not, unless you were very sure indeed
of your ground and your coadjutor, venture to
suggest falsehood. The thing could not be done.
This, however, was what he would have thought the
safest thing  that all should fall back into its usual
state ; that Anne should go on as if she were still
simply Anne, without any difference in her life ; and
that, except for the fine but concealed bond between

them, which should be avowed on the first possible
occasion, but never 'made any display of while things
were not ripe, everything should be exactly as before.
This was perfectly fair in love, according to all
known examples and rules. Something like it had
happened in the majority of similar cases, and
indeed, Cosmo said to himself with a half smile, a
lover might feel himself little flattered for whom
such a sacrifice would not be made. But all the
same he could not suggest it. He could not say to
Anne, ' Tell a lie for me  persuade your father that
all is over between us, though it is not all over
between us and never shall be till death parts us.'
A young man of the nineteenth century, brought up
at a public school and university, a member of the
bar, and in very good society, could not say that. It
would have been an anachronism. He might wish
it, and did do so fervently ; but to put it in words
was impossible.

It was with this view, however, that Cosmo had
emitted all mention of correspondence in his last
interviews with Anne. They were full of so much

N 2

that was novel and exciting to her that she did not
notice the omission, nor in the hurry and rush of
new sensations in her mind had she that eager longing
for a letter which most girls would have felt on
parting with their lovers. She had no habit of
letters. She had never been at school or made any
friendships of the kind that need to be solaced by
continual outpourings upon paper. Almost all her
intimates were about her, seeing her often, not
standing in need of correspondence. She had not
even said in the hurry of parting, ' You will write.'
Perhaps she saw it like himself, but like himself was
unwilling to propose the absolute concealment which
was desirable. Cosmo's mind had been full of
nothing else on his way to Scotland to his friend's
moor. He had thought of her half the time, and
the other half of the time he had thought how to
manage, how to secure her without injuring her
(which was how he put it) ; the long night's journey
was made short to him by these thoughts. He did
not sleep, and he did not want to sleep ; the darkness
of the world through which he was rushing, the

jumble of perpetual sound, which made a sort of
atmosphere about him, was as a hermitage to Cosmo,
as it has been to many before him. Railway trains,
indeed, are hermitages in life for the much-pondering
and careworn sons of the present age. There they
can shut themselves up and think at will. He
turned it all over and over in his mind. No
wild notion  such as had moved the inexperienced
mind of Anne with a thrill of delightful impulse 
of rushing back to work and instantly beginning the
toil which was to win her, occurred to Anne's lover.
To be sure it was the long vacation, which is a
thing girls do not take into account, and Cosmo
would have smiled at the notion of giving up his
shooting and going back to his chambers out of the
mere sentiment of losing no time, which probably
would have appeared to Anne a heroic and delightful
idea ; but he did what Anne could not have done ;
he went into the whole question, all the pros and
C071S, and weighed them carefully. He had a long
journey, far up into the wilds, by the Highland
railway. Morning brought him into the land of

hills and rivers, and noon to the bleaker mountains
and glens, wealthy only in grouse and deer. He
did nothing but think it over in the night and
through the day. Nevertheless, Cosmo, when he
reached Gentian, was as little worn out as it
becomes an experienced young Englishman to be
after a long journey. He was quite fresh for dinner
after he had performed the customary rites  ready
to take his part in all the conversation and help in
the general amusement.

'Douglas  which of the Douglasseses does he
belong to ? ' one of the guests asked after he had
withdrawn.

I've always known him as Douglas of Trinity,'
said the host.

Trinity, Trinity,' answered the other, who was a
local personage, thinking of nothing but territorial
designation, ' I never heard of any Douglasseses of
Trinity. Do you mean the place near Edinburgh
where all the seaside villas are ? '

He means Cambridge,' said another, laughing.


Douglas is the best fellow in the world, but be
is  nobody : at least so I've always beard.'

Cosmo did not overhear this conversation, but he
knew that it had taken place as well as if he had
heard it ; not that it did him the least harm with
his comrades of the moment, to whom he was a
very nice fellow, a capital companion, thoroughly
acquainted with all the habits and customs of their
kind, and though no great shot, yet good enough
for all that was necessary, good enough to enjoy the
sport, which nobody who is awkward and really
ignorant can do. But he knew that one time or
other this little conversation would take place, and
though he felt that he might do himself the credit
to say that he had no false shame, nor attached any
exaggerated importance to the subject, still it was
no doubt of more importance to him than it was to
those with whom it was only one out of many subjects
of a casual conversation. All the same, however,
even these casual talkers did not forget it.
Strange superstition, strangest folly, he might well
say to himself with such a smile as was possible in

the circumstances. Douglas of Trinity  Douglas of
Lincoln's Inn meant something  but to be one of
the Douglasseses of some dilapidated old house, what
did that mean ? This question, however, had
nothing to do with the matter, and the smile had
not much pleasantness in it, as may easily be
perceived.

The fruit of Cosmo's cogitations, however, was
that he wrote to Anne, as has been seen, and sent
his letter to Charley Ashley to be delivered. This
was partly policy and partly uncertainty, a sort of
half measure to feel his way ; but, on the whole, was
most of all the necessity he felt to say something
to her, to seize upon her, not to let this beautiful
dream escape from him.

We said nothing about writing, and I don't know,
my dearest, what you with in this respect. Silence
seems impossible, but if you wish it, if you ask this
sacrifice, I will be content with my perfect trust in
my Anne, and do whatever she would have me do.
I know that it would be against your pride and your
delicacy, my darling, to keep up any correspondence

which the severest parent could call clandestine,
and if I take advantage of a good fellow who is
devoted to us both, for once, it is not with the least
idea that you will like it, or will allow me to continue
it. But what can I do ? I must know what
is your will in this matter, and I must allow myself
the luxury once, if only once, of telling you on paper
what I have tried to tell you so often in words  how
I love you, my love, and what it is to me to love you
a new creation, an opening up both of earth and
heaven.' (We need not continue what Cosmo said
on this point because, to be sure, it has all been said
over and over again, sometimes no doubt worse, and
sometimes unquestionably a great deal better, than
he said it : and there is no advantage that we know
of to be got from making young persons prematurely
acquainted with every possible manner in which this
sentiment can be expressed.) At the end he resumed,
with generous sentiment, which was perfectly
genuine, and yet not any more free of calculation
and the idea of personal advantage than all the rest
was: 

Charley Ashley is the truest friend that ever
man had ; he has loved you all his life that is
nothing wonderful), and yet, though, at such a cost
as I do not like to try to estimate, he still loves me,
though he knows that I have come between him
and any possibility there was that he should ever
win any return from you. To do him full justice, I
do not think he ever looked for any return, but was
content to love you as in itself a happiness and an
elevation for which a man might well be grateful ;
but still it is hard upon him to see a man no better
than himself, nay, less worthy in a hundred ways,
winning the unimaginable reward for which he,
poor Charley, had not so much as ventured to hope.
Yet with a generosity  how can I express it, how
could I ever have emulated it?  which is beyond
words, he has neither withdrawn his brotherly
kindness from me, nor refused to stand by me in my
struggle towards you and happiness. What can we
say to a friend like this? Trust him, my dearest,
as I do. I do not mean that he should be the
medium of communication between us, but there are

ways in which he may be of help and comfort to us
loth ; and, in the meantime, you will at your dear
pleasure tell me yourself what you wish to do, or let
me know by him : if I may write, if I must be silent,
if you will make me a happy man now and then by
a word from your [hand, or if I am to wait for that
hand till I dare claim it as mine. Nay, but my
Anne, my darling, for once, if for once only, you
must send two or three words, a line or two, to give
me patience and hope.'

As he folded this up his whole heart longed for
the ' word or two ' he had asked for. Without that
it almost seemed to him that all that had passed
before might mean nothing, might roll away like the
mists, like the fabric of a vision. But at the same time
Cosmo felt in his heart that if Anne would send
him the consolation of this one letter through
Charley Ashley, and after that bid him be silent and
wait for chance opportunities or modes of communication,
that she would do well. It was what he
would have advised her to do had he been free to
tell her exactly what he thought. But he was not

free to advise such a proceeding. It was not in his
rule; nor could he have proposed any clandestine
correspondence, though he would have liked it. It
was impossible. Anne would most probably have
thrown him off as altogether unworthy had he proposed
anything of the kind to her, or at least would
have regarded him with very different eyes from
those with which she looked upon him now. And
even independent of this he could not have done it :
the words would have failed him to make such a
proposal. It was contrary to all tradition, and to
the spirit of his class and time.

When he had despatched this letter Cosmo's
bosom's lord sat more lightly upon his throne. He
went out next morning very early and made a respectable,
a very respectable, bag. Nobody could say that
he was a cockney sportsman not knowing how to aim or
hold a gun. In this as in everything else he had succeeded
in mastering the rules of every fashion, and
lived as a man who was to the manner born. He
was indeed to the manner born, with nothing in him,
so far as he was aware, that went against the traditions

of a gentleman : and yet similar conversations to that
one which occurred in the smoking-room, occurred occasionally
on the hills among the heather. ' Of what
Douglasseses is your friend ? ' ' Oh, I don't know that
he is of any Douglasseses,' the master of the moor
would say with impatience. ' He is a capital fellow,
and a rising man in the law  that's all I know-about
him ; ' or else, 'He is a college friend, a man
who took a very good degree, as clever a fellow as
you will meet with, and getting on like a house
on fire.' But all these recommendations, as they
all knew, were quite beside the question. He
was of nowhere in particular  he was nobody.
It was a mysterious dispensation, altogether unexplainable,
that such a man should have come
into the world without suitable ancestors who
could have responded for him. But he had done so.
And he could not even produce that fabulous house
which, as he had invented it, was a far prettier and
more truly gentle and creditable family than half the
families who would have satisfied every question.
Thus the very best quality of his age was against

him as well as its superstitions. Had he been an
enriched grocer to whom it could have done no
possible good, he might easily have invented a
pedigree; but being himself he could not do it.
And thus the injury he had sustained at the hands
of Providence was beyond all remedy or hope of
amendment.

Chapter X.

FAMILY COUNSELS.

Has Anne spoken to you all on the subject  what
does she intend to do : '

Mr. Montfort was subjecting his wife to a cross-examination
as to the affairs of the household. It
was a practice he had. He felt it to be beneath his
dignity to inquire into these details in his own person,
but he found them out through her. He was
not a man who allowed his authority to be shared.
So far as ordering the dinner went and regulating
the household bills, he was content to allow that she
had a mission in the world ; but everything of
greater importance passed through his hands. Mrs.
Montfort was in the habit of expressing her extreme
satisfaction with this rule, especially in respect
to Anne. ' What could I have done with a stubborn

girl like that ? she would have worn me out. The
relief that it is to feel that she is in her father's
hands and not in mine ! ' she was in the habit of
saying. But, though she was free of the responsibility,
she was not without trouble in the matter.
She had to submit to periodical questioning, and, if
she had been a woman of fine susceptibilities, would
have felt herself something like a spy upon Anne.
But her susceptibilities were not fine, and the discussion
of other people which her husband's inquisitions
made necessary was not disagreeable to her.
Few people find it altogether disagreeable to sit ina
secret tribunal upon the merits and demerits of
those around them. Sometimes Mrs. Montfort
would rebel at the closeness of the examination to
which she was subjected, but on the whole she did
not dislike it. She was sitting with her husband
in that business-room of his which could scarcely
be dignified by the name of a library. She had her
usual worsted work in her hand, and a wisp of skeins
plaited together in various bright colours on a table
before her. Sometimes she would pause to count

one, two, three, of the stitches on her canvas ; her
head was bent over it, which often made it more
easy to say what she had got to say. A serious
truth may be admitted, or censure conveyed, in the
soft sentence which falls from a woman's lips with
an air of having nothing particular in it, when the
one, two, three, of the Berlin pattern, the exact shade
of the wool, is evidently the primary subject in her
mind. Mrs. Montfort felt and employed to the
utmost the shield of her work. It made everything
more easy, and took away all tedium from these prolonged
conversations. As for Mr. Montfort, there
was always a gleam of expectation in his reddish
hazel eyes. Whether it was about a servant, or his
children, or even an indifferent person in the parish,
he seemed to be always on the verge of finding something
out. ' What does she intend to do ? ' he repeated.
' She has never mentioned the subject
again, but I suppose she has talked it over with
you.'

Something has been said,' answered his wife ;
to say that she had talked it over with me would
VOL. I. o

not be true, St. John. Anne is not one to talk over
anything with anybody, especially me. But something
was said. I confess I thought it my duty,
standing in the place of a mother to her, to open
the subject.'

And what is she going to do ? '

You must know very little about girls, St. John,
though you have two of your own (and one of them
as difficult to deal with as I ever encountered), if
you think that all that is wanted in order to know
what they are going to do is to talk it over with
them  it is not so easy as that.'

I suppose you heard something about it, however,'
he said, with a little impatience. ' Does she
mean to give the fellow up ? that is the chief thing
I want to know.'

I never knew a girl yet that gave a fellow upas
you call it, because her father told her,' said Mrs.
Montfort : and then she paused, hesitating between
two shades ; ' that blue is too blue, it will never
go with the others. I must drive into Hunston today
or tomorrow, and see if I cannot get a better

match.  As for giving up, that was not spoken of,
St. John. Nobody ever believes in it coming to
that. They think you will be angry ; but that of
course, if they stand out, you will come round at the
last.'

Does Anne think that ? She must know very
little of me if she thinks that I will come round at
the last.'

They all think it,' said Mrs. Montfort, calmly
counting the lines of the canvas with her needle :
I m not speaking only of Anne. I daresay she
Accounts upon it less than most do, for it must be
allowed that she is very like you, St. John, and as
obstinate as a mule. You have to be very decided
indeed before a girl will think you mean it. Why,
there is Eose. What I say is not blaming Anne, for
I papa a great deal more sure what my own child
would think than what Anne would think. Rose
would no more believe that you would cross her
seriously in anything she wanted than she would
believe you could fly if you tried. She would cry
outwardly, I don't doubt, but she would smile in hero

2

heart She would say to herself, " Papa go against
me ' impossible ! " and the little puss would look
very pitiful and submissive, and steal her arms
round your neck and coax you, and impose upon you
You would be more than mortal, St. John, if you
did not come round at the end.'

INIr. Montfort's countenance relaxed while this description
was made  an almost imperceptible softening
crept about the corners of his mouth. He seemed to
feel the arms of the little puss creeping round his neck,
and her pretty little rosebud face close to his own.
But he shook oft* the fascination abruptly, and frowned
to make his wife think him insensible to it. ' I hope
I am not such a weak fool,' he said. ' And there is
not much chance that Anne would try that way,' he
added, with some bitterness. Eose was supposed to
be his favourite chill, but yet he resented the fact
that no such confession of his absolute authority and
homage to his power was to be looked for from Anne.
Mrs. Montfort had no deliberate intention of presenting
his eldest daughter to him under an unfavourable
light, but if she wished him to perceive

the superior dutifulness and sweetness of her own
child, could anyone wonder ? Rose had been hardly
used by Nature. She ought to have been a boy and
the heir of entail, or, if not so, she ought to have had
a brother to take that position, and protect her
interests ; and neither of these things had happened.
That her father should love her best and do all in his
will that it was possible to do for her, was clearly
Rose's right as compensation for the other injustices
of fate.

No,' said Mrs. Montfort, after a longer piece
of mental arithmetic than usual, ' that is not Anne's
way ; but still you must do Anne j justice, St. John.
She will never believe, any more than Rose, that you
will go against her, I don't say this from anything
she has said to me. Indeed, I cannot say that she
has spoken to me at all on the subject. It was I that
introduced it ; I thought it my duty.'

And she gave you to understand that she would
go on with it, whatever I might say ; and that, like
an old fool, if she stuck to it, I would give in at the
end ? '

St. John ! St John ! how you do run away witJn
an idea! I never said that, nor anything like it. I
told you what, judging from what I know of girls, I
felt sure Anne must feel. They never dream of any
serious opposition : as we have given in to them from
their childhood, they think we will continue to give
in to them to the end ; and I am sure it is quite
reasonable to think so ; only recollect how often we
have yielded, and done whatever they pleased.'

This time she will find that I will not yield,'
said Mr. Montfort, getting up angrily, and planting
himself in front of the polished fireplace, which was
innocent of any warmth. He set himself very firmly
upon his feet, which were wide apart, and put his
hands under his coat tails in the proverbial attitude
of an Englishman. To see him standing there you
would have thought him a man who never would
yield ; and yet he had, as his wife said, yielded to a
great many vagaries of the girls. She gave various
curious little glances of investigation at him from
over her wools.

I should like to know,' she said, ' why you object

SO much to Mr. Douglas ? he seems a very gentlemanly
young man. Do you know something more
of him than we know ? '

'Nobody,' said Mr. Montfort, with solemnity,
knows any more of the young man than we know.'

Then why should you be so determined against
him ? ' persisted his wife.

Mr. Montfort fixed his eyes severely upon her.
Letitia,' he said, ' there is one thing, above all
others, that I object to in a man ; it is when nobody
knows anything about him. You will not deny that
I have had some experience in life ; some experience
you must grant me, whatever my deficiencies maybe
; and the result of all I have observed is that a
man whom nobody knows is not a person to connect
yourself with. If he is a member of a well-known
family  like our own, for instance  there are his
people to answer for him. If, on the other hand, he
has made himself of consequence in the world, that
may answer the same purpose. But when a man is
nobody, you have nothing to trust to ; he may be a
very good sort of person ; there may be no harm in

him ; but the chances are against him. At all times
the chances are heavily against a man whom nobody
knows.'

Mr. Montfort was not disinclined to lay down
the law, but he seldom did it on an abstract question ;
and his wife looked at him, murmuring ' one, two,
three ' with her lips, while her eyes expressed a
certain mild surprise. The feeling, however, was
scarcely so strong as surprise ; it was rather with a
sensation of unexpectedness that she listened. Surely
nobody had a better right to his opinion : but she
did not look for a general dogma when she had asked
a particular question. ' But,' she said, ' papa ! he
was known very well, I suppose, or they would not
have had him there  to the Ashley s, at least.'

"VVTiat was known ? Nothing about him 
no thin o' whatever about him ! as Anne was so absurd

o

as to say they know Hm, or their own opinion of
him; but they know nothing about him  nobody
knows anything about him. Whatever you may
think, Letitia, that is quite enough for me.'

'Oh, my dear, I don't pretend to understand,

"but we meet a great many people whom we don't
know anything of. In society we are meeting them
for ever.'

'Pardon me,' said Mr. Montfort, lifting an
emphatic finger ; ' lue may know nothing about
them, but somebody knows. Now, all I hear of
this man is that he is nobody ; he may be good or
he may be bad, much more likely the latter ; but,
this being the case, if he were an angel I will have
nothing to do with him ; neither shall anyone belonging
to me. We are well-known people ourselves, and
we must form connections with well-known people 
or none at all.'

None at all ; you would not keep her an old
maid, papa ? '

Pshaw ! ' said Mr. Montfort, turning away.
Then he came back to add a last word. ' Understand
me, Letitia,' he said ; ' I think it's kind of you to do
sour best for x\nne, for she is a girl who has given
you a great deal of trouble ; but it is of no use ; if
she is so determined to have her own way, she shall
not have anything else. I am not the weak idiot of

a father you think me ; if I have given in to her
before, there was no such important matter in hand ;
but I have made up my mind now : and it may be
better for Rose and you, perhaps, if the worst comes
to the worst.'

Mrs. Montfort was completely roused now ; the
numbers, so to speak, dropped from her lips ; her
work fell on her knee. ' It is quite true what you
say,' she said, feeling herself on very doubtful
ground, and not knowing what to do, whether to
express gratitude or to make no reference to this
strange and dark saying ; ' she has given me a great
deal of trouble : but she is your child, St. John, and
that is enough for me.'

He did not make any reply ; nor did he repeat
the mysterious promise of advantage to follow upon
Anne's disobedience. He was not so frank with his
wife as he had been with his daughter. He went to
his writing-table once more, and sat down before it
with that air of having come to an end of the subject
under discussion which his wife knew so well. He
did not mean to throw any further light to her upon

the possible good that might result to Eose. To tell
the truth, this possibility was to himself too vague
to count for much. In the first place, he expected
Anne to be frightened, and to give in ; and, in the
second place, he fully intended to live long after both
his daughters had married and settled, and to be
able to make what dispositions he pleased for years
to come. He was not an old man ; he was still
under sixty, and as vigorous (he believed) as ever he
had been. In such a case a will is a very pretty
weapon to flourish in the air, but it does nobody
much harm. JNIr. Montfort thought a great deal
of this threat of his ; but he no more meant it to
have any speedy effect than he expected the world to
come to an end. Perhaps most of the injustices that
people do by will are done in the same way. It is
not comprehensible to any man that he should be
swept away and others reign in his stead ; therefore
he is more free to make use of that contingency than
if he believed in it. There would always be plenty
of time to set it right ; he had not the least intention
of dying ; but for the moment it was something

potent to conjure withal. He reseated himself at his
table, with a consciousness that he had the power
in his hands to turn his whole world topsy-turvy, and
yet that it would not do anybody any harm. Naturally,
this feeling was not shared either by Anne, to
whom he had made the original threat, nor by his
wife, to whom he held out the promise. We all know
Very well that other people must die  it is only in
our own individual case that the event seems unlikely.
Mrs. Montfort's mind was filled with secret
excitement ; she was eager to know what her husband
meant, but she did not venture to ask for any
explanation. She watched him over her work with
a secret closeness of observation such as she had
never felt herself capable of before. What did he
mean ? what would he do ? She knew nothing
about the law of inheritance, except that entail kept
an estate from the daughters, which was a shame,
she thought. But in respect to everything else her
mind was confused, and she did not know what her
husband could do to benefit Rose at Anne's expense.
But the more she did not understand, the more eager

she was to know. When you are possessed by an
eager desire for the enrichment of another, it does
not seem a bad or selfish object as it might do if the
person to be benefited was yourself ; and, least of all,
does it ever appear that to look out for the advantage
of your child can be wrong. But the poor lady
was in the uncomfortable position of not being able
to inquire f mother. She could not show herself too
anxious to know what was to happen after her
husband's death ; and even to take ' the worst ' for
granted was not a pleasant thing, for Mrs. Mount-ford,
though naturally anxious about Eose, was not a
hard woman who would wilfully hurt anyone. She
sat for some time in silence, her heart beating very
fast, her ears very alert for any word that might fall
from her husband's mouth. But no word came from
his mouth. He sat and turned over the papers on
the table ; he was pleased to have excited her interest,
her hopes and fears, but he did not half divine the
extent to which he had excited her, not feeling for
his own part that there was anything in it to warrant
immediate expectation ; while she, on the other hand,

though she had a genuine affection for her husband,
could not help saying to herself, ' He may go any
day ; there is never a day that some one does not
die ; and if he died while he was on these terms with
Anne, what was it, what was it, that might perhaps
happen to Rose ? ' Mrs. Montfort turned over in
her mind every possible form of words she could
think of in which to pursue her inquiries; but it
was very difficult, nay, impossible, to do it ; and,
though she was not altogether without artifice, her
powers altogether failed her in presence of this difficult
question. At length she ventured to ask,
clearing her throat with elaborate precaution,

Do you mean to say that if Anne sets her heart
upon her own way, and goes against you  all our
children do it more or less ; one gets accustomed

to it, St. John  do you mean to say that you

will change your will, and put her out of the succession
? ' Mrs. Montfort faltered over the end of

her sentence, not knowing what to say.

'There is no succession. What I have is my
own to do what I like with it,' he said sharply ; and

then he opened a big book which lay on the table,
and began to write. It was a well-known, if tacit,
signal between them, that his need of social intercourse
was over, and that his wife might go; but
she did not move for some time. She went on with
her work, with every appearance of calm ; but her
mind was full of commotion. As her needle went
through and through the canvas, she cast many a
furtive glance at her husband turning over the pages
of bis big book, writing here and there a note.
They had been as one for twenty years ; two people
who were, all the world said, most 'united'  a
couple devoted to each other. But neither did she
understand what her husband meant, nor could he
have believed the kind of feeling with which, across
her worsted work, she kept regarding him. She
had no wish but that he should live and thrive.
Her position, her personal interests, her importance
were all bound up in him ; nevertheless, she contemplated
the contingency of his death with a composure
that would have horrified him, and thought with
much more keen and earnest feeling of what would

follow than any alarm of love as to the possibility of
the speedy ending of his life produced in her. Thus
the two sat within a few feet of each other, life-long
companions, knowing still so little of each other
the man playing with the fears and hopes of his
dependents, while smiling in his sleeve at the notion
of any real occasion for those fears and hopes ; the
woman much more intent upon the problematical
good fortune of her child than on the existence of
her own other half, her closest and nearest connection,
with whom her life had been so long identified.
Perhaps the revelation of this feeling in her would
have been the most cruel disclosure had both states
of mind been made apparent to the eye of day.
There was not much that was unnatural in his
thoughts, for many men like to tantalise their
successors, and few men realise with any warmth of
imagination their own complete withdrawal from the
pains and pleasures of life ; but to know that his
wife could look his death in the face without flinching
o- and think more of his will than of the event
which must precede any effect it could have, would

have penetrated through all his armour and opened
his eyes in the most dolorous way. But he never
suspected this ; he thought, with true human fatuity,
with a little gratified importance and vanity, of the
commotion he had produced  that Anne would be
pulled up ' in her career by so serious a threat ; that
Rose would be kept ' up to the mark ' by a flutter of
hope as to the reward which might fall to her. All
this it pleased him to think of. He was complacent
as to the effect of his menaces and promises, but at
bottom he felt them to be of no great consequence
to himself  amusing rather than otherwise ; for he
did not in the least intend to die.

At last Mrs. Montfort felt that she could stay
no longer. She rose up from her chair, and gathered
her wools in one arm. ' The girls will be coming
from their ride,' she said. ' I must really go.'

The girls had all the machinery of life at Mount
in their hands ; in other houses it is ' the boys ' that
are put forward as influencing everything. The
engagements and occupations of the young people
map out the day, and give it diversity, though the

VOL. I. p

elder ones move the springs of all that is most
important. It was generally when ' the girls ' were
busy in some special matter of their own that Mrs.
Montfort came to * sit with ' her husband in the
library, and furnished him with so much information.
But their positions had been changed to-day.
It was he who had been her informant, telling her
about things more essential to be known than any
of her gossip about Anne's intentions or Eose's
habits. She lingered even as she walked across the
floor, and dropped her little plaited sheaf of many
colours and stooped to pick it up, inviting further
confidence. But her husband did not respond. He
let her go without taking any notice of her proceedings
or asking any question as to her unusual
reluctance to leave him. At last, when she had
fairly turned her back upon him, and had her hand
upon the handle of the door, his voice startled her,
and made her turn round with anxious expectation.

By the way,' he said, ' I forgot to tell you : I
have a letter to-day from Heathcote Montfort,

offering a visit. I suppose he wants to spy out the
nakedness of the land.'

Heathcote Montfort ! ' cried his wife, bewildered
; then added, after a little interval, ' I am
sure he is quite welcome to come when he pleases 
he or anyone. There is no nakedness in the land
that we need fear.'

He is coming next week,' said Mr. Montfort.
Of course, as you perceive, I could not refuse.'

Mrs. Montfort paused at the door, with a great
deal of visible interest and excitement. It was no
small relief to her to find a legitimate reason for it.
Of course you could not refuse : why should you

refuse ? I shall be very glad to see him ; and'

she added, after a momentary pause, which gave the
words significance, ' so will the girls.'

I wish I could think so ; the man is forty,' Mr.
jNIountford said. Then he gave a little wave of his
hand, dismissing his wife. Even the idea of a visit
from his heir did not excite him. He was not even
conscious, for the moment, of the hostile feeling with
which men are supposed to regard their heirs in

p 2

general, and which, if legitimate in any case, is
certainly so in respect to an heir of entail. It is
true that he had looked upon Heatchcote Montfort
with a mild hatred all his life as his natural enemy ;
but at the present crisis the head of the house
regarded his successor with a kind of derisive complacency,
as feeling that he himself Alas triumphantly
keeping the fellow out of it.' He had never been
so certain of living long, of cheating all who looked
for his death, as he was after he had made use of
that instrument of terrorism against his daughter.
Heathcote Montfort had not been at Mount for
nearly twenty' years. It pleased his kinsman
that he should offer to come now, just to be tantalised,
to have it proved to him that his inheritance
of the family honours was a long way off, and very
problematical in any sense. ' A poor sort of fellow ;
always ailing, always delicate ; my life is worth two
of his,' he was saying, with extreme satisfaction, in
his heart.

CHAPTEK Xr.

PROJECTS OF Marriage.

The girls had just come in from their ride ; they
were in the hall awaiting that cup of tea which is
the universal restorative, when Mrs. Montfort with
her little sheaf of wools went to join them. They
heard her come softly along the passage which
traversed the house, from the library, in quite the
other end of it, to the hall,  a slight shuffle in one
foot making her step recognisable. Eose was very
clear-sighted in small matters, and it was she who
had remarked that, after having taken her work to
the library ' to sit with papa,' her mother had generally
a much greater acquaintance with all that was
about to happen on the estate or in the family
affairs. She held up her finger to Anne as the step
was heard approaching. ' Now we shall hear the

last particulars,' Eose said ; ' what is going to be
done with us all, and if we are to go to Brighton,
and all that is to happen.' Anne was much less
curious on these points. Whether the family went
to Brighton or not mattered little to her. She took
off her hat, and smoothed back her hair from her
forehead. It was October by this time, and no
longer warm ; but the sun was shining, and the
afternoon more like summer than autumn. Old
Saymore had brought in the tray with the tea.
There was something on his very lips to say,
but he did not desire the presence of his mistress,
which checked his confidences with the young ladies.
Anne, though supposed generally to be proud, was
known by the servants to be very gentle of access,
and ready to listen to anything that concerned them.
And as for Rose, old Saymore  who had, so to speak,
seen her born  did not feel himself restrained by
the presence of Rose. ' I had something to ask
Miss Anne,' he said, in a kind of undertone, as if
making a remark to himself.
What is it, Saymore ? '

'No, no,' said the old man, shaking his head.
No, no ; I am not such a fool as I look. There is
no time now for my business. No, no. Miss Anne,
no, no,' he went on, shaking his head as he arranged
the cups and saucers. The sun, though it had
passed off that side of the house, had caught in some
glittering thing outside, and sent in a long ray of
reflection into the huge old dark mirror which filled
up one side of the room. Old Saymore, with his
white locks, was reflected in this from top to toe,
and the shaking of the white head produced a singular
commotion in it like circles in water. He was
always very deliberate in his movements ; and as
Mrs. Montfort's step stayed in the passage, and a
sound of voices betrayed that she had been stopped
by some one on the way, Eose, with ideas of ' fun '
in her mind, invited the arrested confidence. ' Make
haste and speak,' she said, ' Saymore ; mamma has
stopped to talk to Worth. There is no telling how
long it may be before she comes here.'

If it's Mrs. Worth, it may be with the same
object, miss,' said Saymore, with solemnity. And

then he made a measured, yet sidelong step towards
Anne. ' I hope, Miss Anne, you'll not disapprove ? "

What do you want me to approve of, Saymore ?
I don't think it matters very much so long as mamma
is pleased.'

It matters to me. Miss Anne ; it would seem
unnatural to do a thing that was really an important
thing without the sanction of the family ; and I
come from my late lady's side. Miss Anne. I've
always held by you, miss, if I may make so bold as
to say it.'

Saymore made so bold as to say this often, and it
was perfectly understood in the house ; indeed it
was frequently supposed by new-comers into the
servants' hall that old Saymore was a humble relation
of the family on that side.

It is very kind of you to be so faithful ; tell
me quickly what it is, if you want to say it to me
privately, and not to mamma.'

'Miss Anne, I am an old man,' he said; 'you'll
perhaps think it unbecoming. I'm a widower, miss
and I've no children nor nobody belonging to me.'

We've known all that,' cried Rose, breaking in,
as long as we've lived.'

Sambre took no notice of the interruption ; he
did not even look at her, but proceeded with gravity,
though with a smile creeping to the corners of his
mouth. ' And some folks do say, Miss Anne, that,
though I'm old, I'm a young man of my years.
There is a deal of difference in people. Some folks is
older, some younger. Yourself, Miss Anne, if I might
make so bold as to say so, you're not a young lady
for yom years.'

No, is she ? ' said Eose. ' I always tell you so,
Anne ! you've no imagination, and no feelings ; you
are as serious as the big trees. Quick, quick, Say-more,
mamma is coming.'

I've always been considered young-looking,' said
old Saymore, with a complacent smile, ' and many
and many a one has advised me to better my condition.
That might be two words for themselves and
one for me, Miss Anne,' he continued, the smile
broadening into a smirk of consciousness. ' Ladies
is very pushing now-a-days ; but I think I've picked

out one as will never deceive me, and, if the family
don't have any objections, I think I am going to get
married, always hoping. Miss Anne, as you don't
disapprove.'

'To get married?' said Anne, sitting upright
with sheer amazement. Anne's thoughts had not
been occupied on this subject as the thoughts of
girls often are ; but it had entered her imagination
suddenly, and Anne's imagination was of a superlative
kind, which shed a glory over everything that
occupied it. This strange, beautiful, terrible, conjunction
of two had come to look to her the most
wonderful, mysterious, solemn thing in the world
since it came within her own possibilities. All the
comedy in it which is so apt to come uppermost had
disappeared when she felt herself walking with
Cosmo towards the verge of that unknown and awful
paradise. Life had not turned into a tragedy indeed,
but into a noble, serious poem, full of awe, full
of wonder, entering in by those great mysterious
portals, which were guarded as by angels of love and
fate. She sat upright in her chair, and gazed with

wide open eyes and lips apart at this caricature of
her fancy. Old Say more ? the peal of laughter with
which Rose received the announcement was the
natural sentiment ; but Anne had not only a deep
sense of horror at this desecration of an idea so
sacred, but was also moved by the secondary consciousness
that old Saymore too had feelings which
might be wounded, which added to her gravity.
Saymore, for his part, took Eose's laugh lightly
enough, but looked at her own grave countenance
with rising offence. 'You seem to think that I
haven't no right to please myself. Miss Anne,' he
said.

But who is the lady ? tell us who is the lady,'
cried Rose.

Saymore paused and held up a finger. The
voices in the corridor ceased. Some one was heard
to walk away in the opposite direction, and Mrs.
Montfort's soft shuffle advanced to the hall.
 Another time. Miss Anne, another time,' he said, ina
half whisper, shaking his finger in sign of secresy.
Then he walked towards the door, and held it open

for his mistress with much solemnity. Mrs. Mount-ford
came in more quickly than usual ; she was halt
angry, half laughing. ' Saymore, I think you are
an old fool,' she said.

Saymore made a bow which would have done
credit to a courtier. ' There's a many, madam,' he
replied, ' as has been fools like me.' He did not
condescend to justify himself to Mrs. Montfort,
but went out without further explanation. He
belonged to the other side of the house ; not that he
was not perfectly civil to his master's second wife 
but she was always  the new mistress ' to Saymore,
though she had reigned at Mount for nearly twenty
years.

What does he mean, mamma ? ' cried Rose, with
eager curiosity. She was fond of gossip, about
county people if possible, but, if not, about village
people, or the servants in the house, it did not
matter. Her eyes shone with amazement and excitement.
' Is it old Worth ? who is it ? What fun
to have a wedding in the house ! '

He is an old fool,' said Mrs. Montfort, putting

the wools out of her arm and placing herself in the
most comfortable chair. * Grive me a cup of tea,
Rose. I have been standing in the corridor till I'm
quite tired, and before that with papa.'

You were not standing when you were with
papa ? '

Well, yes, part of the time ; he has a way 
Anne has it too, it is very tiresome  of keeping the
most important thing he has to say till the last
moment. Just when you have got up and got to the
door, and think you are free, then he tells you. It
is very tiresome  Anne is just the same  in many
things she is exceedingly like papa.'

Then he told you something important ? ' cried
Eose, easily diverted from the first subject. 'Are
we to go to Brighton ? What is going to happen ?
I told Anne you would have something to tell us
when we heard you had been sitting with papa.'

Of course we consult over things when we get a
quiet hour together,' Mrs. Montfort said ; and then
she made a pause. Even Anne felt her heart beat.
It seemed natural that her own affairs should have

been the subject of this conference ; for what was
there in the family that was half so interesting as
Anne's affairs ? A little colour came to her face
then fled again, leaving her more pale than usual.

If it was about me, I would rather not have my
affairs talked over,' she said.

My dear Anne,' said Mrs. Montfort, ' try not
to get into the way of thinking that everything that
is interesting in the family must come from you ;
this is a sort of way that girls get when they begin
to think of love and such nonsense ; but I should
have expected more sense from you.'

Love and such nonsense ! Anne's countenance
became crimson. Was this the way to characterise
that serious, almost solemn, mystery which had
taken possession of her life ? And then the girl, in
spite of herself, laughed. She felt herself suddenly
placed beside old Saymore in his grotesque sentiment,
and between scorn and disgust and unwilling
amusement words failed her ; then the others
laughed, which made Anne more angry still.

I am glad to hear you laugh,' said Mrs. Mount-ford,

' for that shows you aie not so much on your
high horse as I fancied you were. And yours is such
a very high horse, my dear ! No, I don't mean to
say you were not referred to, for you would not
believe me ; there was some talk about you ; but
papa said he had spoken to you himself, and I never
make nor meddle between him and you, as you
know, Anne. It was something quite different.
We are not going to Brighton, Rosie ; some one is
coming here.'

Oh  h ! ' Rose's countenance fell. Brighton,
which was a break upon the monotony of the country,
was always welcome to her. 'And even Willie
Ashley gone away ! ' was the apparently irrelevant
observation she made, with a sudden drooping of the
corners of her mouth.

What is Willie Ashley to you ? you can't have
your game in winter,' said her mother, with
unconscious cynicism ; ' but there is somebody
coming who is really interesting. I don't know
that you have ever seen him ; I have seen him only
once in my life. I thought him the most 

man I ever saw ; he was like a hero on
the stage, tall and dark, with a natural curl in his
hair ; and such eyes ! '

Eose's blue and inexperienced orbs grew round
and lahore with excitement. ' Who is it ? No one

o

we ever saw ; oh, no, indeed, I never saw a man a
bit like that. Who is it, mamma ? '

Mrs. Montfort liked to prolong the excitement.
It pleased her to have so interesting a piece of news
in hand. Besides, Anne remained perfectly unmoved,
and to excite Eose was too easy. ' He is a
man with a story too,' she said. * When he was
quite young he was in love with a lady, a very grand
personage, indeed, quite out of the reach of a poor
gentleman like  this gentleman. She was an
Italian, and I believe she was a princess or something.
That does not mean the same as it does
here, you know ; but she was a great deal grander
than he was, and her friends would not let her marry
him.'

And what happened ? ' cried Eose breathless, asher
mother came to an artful pause. Anne did not

say anything, but she leant forward, and her eyes
too had lighted up with interest. It was no part of
Mrs. Montfort's plan to interest Anne, but, once
entered upon her story, the desire of the artist for
appreciation seized upon her.

What could happen, my dear ? ' she said,
pointedly adding a moral ; * they gave everybody a
great deal of trouble for a time, as young people
who are crossed in anything always do ; but people
abroad make very short work with these matters.
The lady was married, of course, to somebody in her
own rank of life.'

And the gentleman ?  it was the gentleman you
were telling us about.'

The gentleman  poor Heatlicote ! well, he has
got on well enough  I suppose as well as other
people. He has never married ; but then I don't
see how he could marry, for he has nothing to marry
upon.'

Heathcote I do you mean Heathcote Mount-ford
? '

It was Anne v>'ho spoke ibis time  the story bed

VOL. I. Q

grown more and more interesting to her as it went
on. Her voice trembled a little as she asked this
hasty question; it quivered with sympathy, with
wondering pain. The lady married somebody  in
her own rank in life  the man never married at all,
but probably could not because he had nothing to
marry on. Was that the end of it all  a dull matter-of-fact
little tragedy ? Lie remembered hearing
such words before often enough, but never had given
them any attention until now.

Yes, I mean your cousin Heathcote Montfort.
He is coming next week to see papa.'

Eose had been looking from one to another with
her round eyes full of excitement. Now she drew a
long breath and said in a tone of awe, ' The heir of
the entail.'

Yes, the heir of the entail,' said Mrs. Mount-ford
solemnly. She looked at her daughter, and the
one pair of eyes seemed to take fire from the other.
He is as poor  as poor as a mouse. Of course he
will have Mount when  anything happens to papa.
But papa's life is as good as his. He is thirty-five,

and he has never had much stamina. I don't mean
to say that it is so generally, but sometimes a man
is quite old at thirty-five.'

At this time very different reflections gleamed
across the minds of the girls. 'Papa was nearly
forty when mamma married him,' Eose said to herself
with great quickness, while the thought that
passed through Anne's mind was ' Thirty-five  five
years older than Cosmo.' Neither one thing nor the
other, it may be said, had much to do with Heath cote
Montfort ; and yet there was meaning in it, so far
as Rose at least was concerned.

She was thoughtful for the rest of the day, and
asked her mother several very pertinent questions
v.hen they were alone, as 'Adhere does Heathcote
Montfort live? Has he any money at all? or
does he do anything for his living? has ho any
brothers and sisters ? ' She was determined to have
a very clear understanding of all the circumstances
of his life.

Oh yes, my love, he has a little,' Mrs. Mount-ford
said ; * one says a man has nothing when he has
Q 2

not c nongh to settle upon ; but most people have a
little. I suppose he lives in London in chambers,
like most unmarried men. No, he has no brothers
and sisters,  but, yes, I forgot there is one  a young
one  whom he is very much attached to, people
say.'

And he will have Mount when papa dies,' said
Eose. ' How strange that, though papa has two
children, it should go away to quite a different
person, not even a very near relation ! It is very
unjust; don't you think it is very unjust? I am
sure it is not a thing that ought to be.'

It is the entail, my dear. You must remember
the entail.'

But what is the good of an entail ? If we had
had a brother, it might have been a good thing to
keep it in the family ; but surely, when we have no
brother, we are the proper heirs. It would be more
right even, if one person were to have it all, that
Anne should be the person. She, said Rose, with a
little fervour, ' would be sure to take care of me.'

I think so too, Rosie,' said her mother ; ' but

then Anne will not always just be Anne. She will
marry somebody, and she will not have a will of her
own  at least not such a will of her own. There is
one way,' Mrs. Montfort added with a laugh, ' in
which things are sometimes put right, Eose. Do
you remember Mr. Collins in Miss Austen's novel ?
He came to choose a wife among the Miss Bennett
to make up for taking their home from them. I am
afraid that happens oftener in novels than in real
life. Perhaps,' she said, laughing again, but with
artificial mirth, ' your cousin Heathcote is coming to
look at you girls to see whether he would like one of
you for his wife.'

I daresay,' said Rose calmly ; ' that went through
my mind too. He would like Anne, of course, if he
could get her ; but then Anne  likes somebody
else.'

There are more people than Anne in the world,'
said the mother, with some indignation. ' Anne I
we all hear so much of Anne that we get to think
there is nobody like her. No, my pet, a man of
Heathcote Montfort's age  it is not anything like

Anne he is thinking of; the don't want tragedy
queens at that age ; they want youth,'

You mean, mamma, said Rose, still quito
serious, ' that he would like me Lest.'

'My pet, we don't talk of such things. It is
quite time enough when they happen, if they ever
happen.'

'But I prefer to talk about them,' said Rose.
It would be very nice to keep Mount ; but then ,
if Anne had all the money, what would be the
good of 3Iount? We, I mean, could never keep
it up.'

This is going a very long way,' said her mother,
amused ; ' you must not talk of what most likely will
never happen. Besides, there is no telling what
changes may take place. Anne has not pleased papa,
and no one can say what money she may have and
what you may have. That is just what nobody can
tell till the time comes.'

You mean till papa dies ? '

Oh, Rosie,' said Mrs. Montfort, alarmed,  don't
be so plain-spoken, dear ; don't let us think of such a

things. What would become of us if anything
happened to dear papa ? '

But it must happen some time,' said Eose, calmly,
and it will not happen any sooner because we speak
of it. I hope he will live a long time, long after weare
both married and everything settled. But if one
of us was rich, it would not be worth her while to
marry Heathcote, unless she was very fond of Mount ;
and I don't think we arc so very fond of Mount.
And if one of us was poor, it would not be worth his
while, because he would not be able to keep it up.'

That is the very best conclusion to come to,' said
her mother ; ' since it would not be worth while either
for the rich one or the poor one, you may put that
oat of your head and meet him at your ease, as you
ought to meet an elderly cousin.'

'Thirty-five is not exactly elderly  for a man,'
said Eose, thoughtfully. She did not put the question
out of her mind so easily as her mother suggested.
*But I suppose it is time to go and dress,' she
added, with a little sigh. ' Xo Brighton, and
winter coming on, and nobody here, not even Willie

Ashley. I hope he will be amusing at least,' she said,
sighing again, as she went away.

Mrs. Montfort followed slowly with a sniile
on her face. She was not sorry, on the whole, to
have put the idea into her child's head. Even when
the Mountfords of Mount had been poor, it was ' a
very nice position '  and Heathcote had something
enough to live upon : and Rose would have something.
If they ' fancied ' each other, worse things might
happen. She did not feel inclined to oppose such a
consummation. It would be better than marrying
Willie Ashley, or  for of course that would be out of
the question  wanting to marry him. Mrs. Mount-ford
knew by experience what it was for a girl to
spend all her youth in the unbroken quiet of a house
in the country which was not really a great house.
She had been thirty when she married Mr. Mount-ford,
and before that time there had occurred sundry
passages, involving at least one ineligible young man,
which had not quite passed from her memory. How
was it possible to help it ?  a girl must do something
to amuse herself, to occupy the time that hangs so
heavily on her hands. And often, she reflected,

before you know what you are doing, it has become
serious, and there is no way out of it. As she looked
back she remembered many instances in which this
had happened. Better, far better, an elderly cousin
with an old though small estate, than the inevitable
clergyman or Willie Ashley. And thirty-five, for a
man, was not an age to make any objection to.

She went upstairs with her head full of such
thoughts, and there once more she found Mrs. Worth,
with whom she had held so earnest a colloquy in the
corridor, while Saymore opened his heart to his
young ladies. Mrs. Worth shook her head when her
mistress addressed a question to her. She pinned on
the lace pelerine with which it was Mrs. Montfort's
pride to make her old dresses look nice for the
evening, with many shaking of her head.

I don't know, ma'am, as I shall ever bring her
to hear reason,' Mrs. Worth said. ' I tell her as a
good worthy man, and a nice little bit of money, is
not for any girl to despise, and many that is her
betters would be glad of the chance. But " you can't
put an old head on young shoulders," as the saying is,
and I don't know as I shall ever bring her to hear

reason. There's things as nothing will teach us but
experience ma'am,' Mrs. Worth said.

Well, he is old for such a girl, said Mrs. Mount-ford,
candidly ; ' we must not be too hard upon her,
Worth.'

Old, ma'am ! well, in one way he may be called
old,' said the confidential maid ; ' but I don't call it
half so bad when they're that age as when they're
just betwixt and between, both old and young, as
you may say. Forty or so, that is a worry ; but
sixty-five you can do with. If I've told her that once
I've told her fifty times ; but she pays no attention.
And when you think what a nice little bit of money
he's put away since he's been here, and how respectable
he is, and respected by the family ; and that she
has nothing, poor girl! and nobody but me to look
to ! I think, if Miss Anne were to speak a word to
her, ma'am, perhaps it would make a difference.
They think a deal more of what a young lady
says, like themselves, so to speak, than an old person
like me.'

CHAPTER XII.

MISTRESS AND MAID.

Anne had gone upstairs some time before. At this
time of her life she liked to be alone, and there were
many reasons why solitude should be dear to her.
For one thing, those who have just begun to thread
the flowery ways of early love have always a great
deal to think of. It is an occupation in itself to
retrace all that has been done and said, nay, even
looked and thought, and to carry this dream of
recollection on into the future, adding what shall be
to what has been. A girl does not require any other
business in life when she has this delightful maze
awaiting her, turning her room into a Vita nova,
another life which she can enter at her pleasure,
shutting impenetrable doors upon all vulgar sights
and sounds. In addition to this, which needed no

addition, she had something active and positive to
occupy her. She had answered Cosmo's letter, thanking
him for his offer to deny himself, to be silent if she
wished him to be silent. But Anne declared that she
had no such wish. ' Do not let us make a folly of our
correspondence,' she had written ; ' but neither must we
deny ourselves this great happiness, dear Cosmo, for
the sake of my father. I have told my father that
in this point I cannot obey him. I should scorn
myself now if I made believe to obey him by giving
up such intercourse as we can have. He has not
asked this, and I think it would not be honest to
offer it. What he wanted was that we should part
altogether, and this we are not going to do. Write
to me then, not every day, nor even every week, to
make it common, but when your heart is full, and it
would be an injustice to keep it from me any longer.
And so will I to you.' The bargain, if somewhat
high flown, was very like Anne, and on this footing
the letters began. Anne very soon felt that her
heart was always full, that there was constantly
more to say than a sheet of paper could carry ; but

she held by her own rule, and only broke silence
when she could not keep it any longer, which gave
to her letters a character of intensity and delicate
passion most rare and strange, which touched her
lover with an admiration which sometimes had a
little awe in it. His own letters were delightful to
Anne, but they were of a very different character.
They were full of genuine love ; for, so far as that
went, there was nothing fictitious in his sentiments ;
but they were steadying weekly letters, such as a
man pens on a certain day and sends by a certain
post, not only to the contentment of his own heart,
but in fulfilment of what is expected of him, of what
it is indeed his duty to do. This made a great
difference ; and Cosmo  who was full of intellectual
perceptions and saw more clearly than, being not so
complete in heart as in mind, it was to his own
comfort to see  perceived it very clearly, with an
uneasy consciousness of being 'not up to ' the lofty
strain which was required ot him. But Anne, in
her innocence and inexperience, perceived it not.
His letters were delightful to her. The words

seemed to glow and shine before her eyes. If there
was a tame expression, a sentence that fell flat, she
set it down to that reticence of emotion, that
English incapacity for saying all that is felt and
tendency to depreciate itself, which we all believe
in, and which counts for so much in our estimates of
each other. These letters, as I have said, added an
actual something to be done to the entrancing occupation
of ' thinking over ' all that had happened and
was going to happen. Whenever she had a little
time to spare, Anne, with her heart beating, opened
the little desk in which she kept these two or three
precious performances. I think, indeed, she carried
the last always about her, to be re-read whenever an
occasion occurred : and it was with her heart intent
upon this gratification, this secret delight which
nobody knew of, that she went into her room, leaving
her sister and stepmother still talking over their
tea in the hall. More sweet to her than the best of
company was this pleasure of sitting alone.

But on this occasion she found herself not alone.
Though the dressing-bell would not ring for about

an hour, Keziah was already there preparing her
young lady's evening toilette. She was standing
with her back to the door laying out Anne's dress
upon the bed, and crying softly to herself. Keziah
was very near Anne's age, and they had been in a
manner brought up together, and had known everything
that had happened to each other all their
lives. This makes a bond between mistress and
maid, not common in the ordinary relationships
which we form and break so easily. To see Keziah
crying was not a matter of indifference to Anne ;
but neither was it a matter of alarm, for it was not
difficult to make Keziah cry. Some one, no doubt,
had been scolding the girl ; her aunt, who was very
strict with her, or the cook, who was half-housekeeper
and apt to find fault with the younger
servants. Anne stepped forward with her light
foot, which Keziah, in her agitation, did not hear,
and put her hand on the girl's shoulder. But this,
which was done in all kindness, had tragical results.
Keziah started violently, and a great big tear, as
large as half-a-crown, fell upon the airy skirts of

the dress which she was opening out on the bed.
The poor girl uttered a shriek of dismay.

Oh, Miss Anne ! I didn't mean it, I didn't
mean it ! ' she cried.

What is it, Keziah ? There is no harm done ;
but why are you crying ? Has anything happened
at home ? Have you bad news ? or is it only Worth
that has been cross again ? '

I'm silly, INIiss Anne, that's \vhat it is,' said
Keziah, drying her eyes. ' Oh, don't pity me, please,
or I'll only cry more ! Give me a good shaking ;
that's what I want, as aunt always says.'

Has she been scolding you ? ' said Anne. It
was not the first time that she had found Keziah in
tears ; it was not an alarming occurrence, nor did it
require a very serious cause.

*But to think,' cried the girl, 'that I should be
such a silly, me that ought to know better, as to go
and cry upon an Indian muslin, that oughtn't to goto
the wash not for ever so long ! Aunt would never
forgive me if she knew ; and oh, I'm bad enough
already without that ! If I coukl only tell you, Miss

Anne ! Morning or evening she never lets me be.
It's that as makes me so confused, I don't know what
I'm doing. Sometimes I think I'll just take and
marry him, to have done with him and her too.

Marry him ? is that what is the matter ? It
must be some one you don't like, or you wouldn't
cry so.'

'It isn't so much that I don't like him. If that
was all,' said Keziah, with philosophy, ' I wouldn't
mind so much. Many a girl has had the same todo.
You have to take the bitter with the sweet, as
aunt always says.'

'Keziah I ' exclaimed Anne, with consternation.
You wouldn't mind I then what are you crying for ?
And why do you try to cheat me into sympathy,'
cried the young lady, indignantly, ' if you don't
mind, as you say ? '

Keziah by this time had mastered her tears.
She had dried the spot carefully and tenderly with
a handkerchief, pressing the muslin between two folds.

'Miss Anne,' she said, 'don't you say as I'm
cheating, or my heart will break. That is one

TOL. I. R

thing nobody can say of me. I tell him honest that
I can't abide him, and if he will have me after that,
is it my fault ? No, it's not that,' she said shaking
her head with the melancholy gravity of superior
experience : ' I wasn't thinking just of what I'd like.
You ladies do what you please, and when you're
crossed, you think the world is coming to an end ;
but in our class of life, you're brought up to know
as you can't have your own way.'

It is not a question of having your own way.
How could you marry a man you did not  love?'
cried Anne, full of wrath and indignation, yet with
awe of the sacred word she used. Was it too fine a
word to be used to little Keziah ? The girl gazed
at her for a moment, half-roused, half wondering ;
then shook her head again.

Oh, ]Miss Anne, love I a girl couldn't love an old
man like that ; and he don't look for it, aunt says.
And he'd think a deal of me, more than  than others
might. It's better to be an old man's darling thana
young man's slave. And he's got plenty of money
I don't know how much  in the bank ; and mother

and all of us so poor. He would leave it to me,
every penny. You can't just hear that, Miss Anne,
can you, and take no notice ? There's a deal to be
said for him, I don't deny it ; and if it was only not
being fond of him, I shouldn't mind that.'

Then you must not ask me to be sorry for you,'
said Anne, with stern severity, ' if you could sell
yourself for money, Keziah ! But, no, no, you could
not do it, it is not possible  you, a girl just my age,
and brought up with me. You could not do it,
Keziah. You have lived here with me almost all
your life.'

'Miss Anne, you don't understand. You've been
used to having your own way ; but the like of us
don't get our ovm way. And aunt says many a
lady does it and never minds. It's not that,' sajY
Keziah, with a fresh outburst of tears. ' I hoje said
could do my duty by a man whether I was fond of
him or whether I wasn't. Xo, it isn't that : it's 
it's the other one, Miss Anne.'

And here the little girl hid her face in her hands
and sobbed ; while Anne, her sternness molting in
II 2

spite of herself, stood looking on with the face of the
recording angel, horrified by this new admission and
reluctant to write it down.

Is there  another ? ' she asked in a whisper of
horror.

Keziah uncovered her face ; the tone in which
she was addressed curdled her blood ; she turned her
white, little, tear-stained countenance to her mistress
with an appalled look of guilt. She had not understood
before, poor little girl, how guilty she was.
She had not known that it was guilt at all. She was
herself standing at the bar, a poor little tremulous
criminal in the blaze of Anne's indignant eyes.

Yes, Miss Anne.' Keziah's voice was almost
inaudible ; but her eyes kept an astonished appeal
in them against the tremendous sentence that seemed
to await her.

Another whom you love. And you vould give
him up for this man who is rich, who can leave you
his money ? Keziah ! if this were true, do you know
what you would deserve ? But 1 cannot believe it is
true.'

Miss Anne I ' The poor little culprit remained
a little courage ; the offence of a mercenary marriage
did not touch her conscience, but to be supposed to
be laying claim without reason to a real lover went
to her heart. ' Miss Anne ; it's quite true. We
were always sweethearts, always since we were little
things. Him and me ; we've always kept company.
It's as true  as true ! Nobody can say different,'
cried the girl, with a fresh burst of angry tears.
You have seen him yourself, Miss Anne ; and all
the village knows. Ask aunt, if you don't believe
me ; ask anyone. We're as. well known to be keeping
company, as well known  as the Beeches on
Mount Hill.'

That is not what I mean, Keziah. What I
can't believe is that you could make up your mind
to  marry the man who is rich. What I leave the
other whom you love, and marry one whom you
don't love ! However rich he was, you would be
miserable ; and he, poor fellow ! would be miserable
too.'

'Oh, Miss Anne, that's what I am afraid of I

cried the girl ;  that's what I'm always saying to
myself. I could face it if it were only me  (for it's a
great thing to be well off, Miss Anne, for us as have
been so poor all our lives) ; but Jim will be miserable
; that is what I always say. But what can I do ?
tell me what can I do.'

I will tell you what you can do. Be faithful to
Jim, Keziah ; be faithful to Trim whatever anyone
says. Marry him, not the other. That is the only
thing to do.'

Marry him ? But how can I marry him when
he's enlisted and gone off for a soldier, and maybe
I'll never see him more ? '

Enlisted ! ' said Anne, for the moment taken
aback ; but she recovered quickly, seeing the easiest
way out of it. ' Soldiers are allowed to buy themselves
out. I would rather a great deal do without
a dress and give you the money for his discharge.
Anything would be better than to see you Sacrifice
yourself  sell yourself. Oh, you could not do it !
You must not think of it any more.'

It's not me, Miss Anne,' said Keziah, mournfully
; ' it's Mr. Sa3'more and aunt.'

Old Sajmore ! is it old Saymore ? ' Anne did
not know how to speak with ordinary patience of
such a horrible transaction. 'Keziah, this cannot he
put up with for a moment. If they frighten you, I
will speak to them. Old Saymore ! No, Keziah ;
it is Jim you must marry, since you love him : and
no one else.'

'Yes, Miss Anne,' said Keziah, very doubtfully;
'but I don't know,' she added, ' whether Jim wanted
me  to marry him. You see he is young, and he
had nothing but his weekly wage, when he was in
work ; and I don't even know if he wants to buy his
discharge. Men is very queer,' said the girl, shaking
her head with profound conviction, ' and keeping
company's not like marrying. Them that haven't
got you want you, and them that can have you for
the asking don't ask. It is a funny world and men
are queer ; things is not so straightforward before
you to do one or another as you think, Miss Anne.'

Then, at all events, there is one thing you can

always dc  for it depends upon yourself alone.
jNIarry no one, but be faithful, Keziah ; faithful to
Jim if you love him ; and, you may be sure, things
will come right at the last.'

I don't know, Miss Anne,' said Keziah, shaking
her head ;  it seems as if it ought to ; but it don't
always, as far as I can see. There's ladies, and real
ladies, aunt says, as has just the same before them ;
for if the man you like hasn't a penny. Miss Anne,
and other folks has plenty, what, even if you're a
lady, is a girl to do ? '

You can always be faithful, whatever happens,'
cried Anne, holding her head high ; ' that depends
only on yourself.'

If your folks will let you alone. Miss Anne.'
Keziah had dried her tears, and Anne's confidence
lead given her a little courage ; but still she felt that
she had more experience of the world than her
mistress, and shook her little head.

What can your " folks" do, Keziah ? You have
only to hold fart and be true,' cried Anne. Her eyes
shone with the faith and constancy that were in her.

The very sight of her was inspiring. She looked
like a woman who might have rallied an army,
standing up with her head high, defying all danger.
'They may make you unhappy, they may take everything
from you ; but only yourself can change you.
The whole world cannot do anything to you if you
remain true, and stand fast '

Oh, Miss Anne, if we was all like you ! ' said the
girl, admiring but despondent. But just then the
dressing-bell began to ring, and poor Keziah was
recalled to her duties. She flew to the drawers and
wardrobes to lay out the miscellaneous articles that
were needed  the evening shoes, the ribbons, and
little ornaments Anne was to wear. Then she
lingered for a moment before fulfilling the same
office for Rose. ' Don't you think, Miss Anne,' she
said, ' if it comes to that at the end : don't you think
I mind for myself. I hope as I'll do my duty, whoever
the man may be. I'm not one to stick to my
own way when I see as I can't get it. It isn't that
I'm that bent on pleasing myself '

*But Keziah, Keziah!' cried Anne, provoked,

distressed, and disappointed, ' when this is what you
are thinking of, it is your duty to please yourself.'

The Bible don't say so, JNIiss Anne,' said Keziah,
with a little air of superior wisdom as she went
away.

This discussion made the most curious break in
Anne's thoughts ; instead of spending the half-hour
in blessed solitude, reading over Cosmo's last letter
or thinking over some of his last words, how strange
it was to be thus plunged into the confused and
darkling ways of another world, so unlike her own !
To the young lady it was an unalterable canon of
faith that marriage was only possible where love
existed first. Such was the dogma of the matter in
England, the first and most important proviso of the
creed of youth, contradicted sometimes in practice,
but never shaken in doctrine. It was this that justified
and sanctified all the rest, excusing even a
hundred little departures from other codes, little
frauds and compromises which lost all their guilt
when done for the sake of love. But here was
another code which was very different, in which the

poor little heroine was ashamed to have it thought
that, so far as concerned herself, love was the first
thing in question. Keziah felt that she could do her
duty whoever the man might be ; it was not any
wish to please herself that made her reluctant.
Anne's first impulse of impatience, and annoyance,
and disgust at such a view of the question, and at
the high ground on which it was held, transported
her for the moment out of all sympathy with Keziah,
No wonder, she thought, that there was so much trouble
and evil deep down below the surface when that was
how even an innocent girl considered the matter.
But by-and-by Anne's imagination got entangled
with the metaphysics of the question, and the clear
lines of the old undoubting dogmatism became less
clear. 'The Bible don't say so.' What did the
Bible say ? Nothing at all about it; nothing but a
rule of mutual duty on the part of husbands and
wives ; no guidance for those who were making the
first great decision, the choice that must mean
happiness or no happiness to their whole lives. But
the Bible did say that one was not to seek one's own

way, nor care to please one's self, as Keziah said.
Was the little maid an unconscious sophist in her
literal adoption of these commands ? or was Anne
to blame, who, in this point of view, put aside the
Bible code altogether, without being aware that she
did so ? Deny yourself ! did that mean that you
were to consent to a mercenary union when your
heart was against it ? Did that mean that you
might profane and dishonour yourself for the sake of
pleasing others ? Keziah thought so, taking the
letter as her rule ; but how was Anne to think so ?
Their theories could not have been more different
had the width of the world been between them.

And then the story of Heathcote Montfort
glanced across her mind. This was what had
happened to him. His Italian princess, though
she loved him, had done her duty, had married
somebody of her own rank, had left the man she
loved to bear the desertion as he could. Was it the
women who did this, Anne asked herself, while the
men were true ? It was bitter to the girl to think

SO, for she was full of that visionary pride  born
both of the chivalrous worship and the ceaseless
jibes of which they have been the objects  which
makes women so sensitive to all that touches their
sex. A flush of shame as visionary swept over her.
If this cowardly weakness was common to women,
then no wonder that men despised them ; then,
indeed, they must be inferior creatures, incapable of
real nobleness, incapable of true understanding*. Fora
moment Anne felt that she despised and hated her
own kind ; to be so poor, so weak, so miserable ; to
persuade the nobler, stronger being by their side
that they loved him, and then weakly to abandon
him ; to shrink away from him for fear of a parent's
scolding or the loss of money, or comfort, or luxury !
What indignation Anne poured forth upon these
despicable creatures ! and to call it duty ! she cried
within herself. When you can decide that one side
is quite in the wrong, even though it be your own
side, there is consolation in it ; then all is plain
sailing in the moral element, and no complication

disturbs you. Though she felt it bitter, and humiliating,
and shameful, Anne clung to this point of
view. She was barely conscious, in the confused
panorama of that unknown world that spread around
her, of some doubtful points on which the light was
not quite so simple and easy to identify. ' Those that
can have you for the asking don't ask you,' Keziah
said : and she had not been sure that her lover wanted
her to marry him, though she believed he would be
miserable if she abandoned him. And Heathcote
Montfort, though he seemed to be so faithful, had
never been rich enough to make inconstancy possible.
These were the merest specks of shadow on the full
light in which one side of her picture was bathed.
But yet they were there.

This made an entire change in Anne's temper
and disposition for the evening. Her mind was full
of this question. When she went downstairs she
suffered a great many stories to be told in her presence
to which, on previous occasions, lie would
have turned a deaf ear ; and it was astonishing how

many corresponding cases seem to exist in society 
the women ' doing their duty '-weakly, giving in to the
influence of some mercenary parent, abandoning love
and truth for money and luxury; the men withdrawing
embittered, disgusted, no doubt to jibe at women, perhaps
to hate them ; to sink out of constancy into misanthropy,
into the rusty loneliness of the old bachelor.
Her heart grew sad within her as she pondered. Was
it to be her fate to vindicate all women, to show what
a woman could do ? but for the moment she felt
herself too deeply disgusted with her sex to think of
defending them from any attack. To be sure, there
was that shadow in her picture, that fluctuation,
that uncomfortable balance of which she was just
conscious  Jim who, perhaps, would not have wanted
to marry Keziah, though he loved her ; and the
others who could not afford to commit any imprudence,
who could marry only when there was a
fortune on what Mrs. Montfort would call * the
other side.' Anne felt herself cooped in, in the
narrowest space, not knowing where to turn ; * who

could marry only when there was money on the
other side.' Why, this had been said of Cosmo !
Anne laughed to herself, with an indignation and
wrath, slightly, very slightly, tempered by amusement.
Where Cosmo was concerned she could not
tolerate even a smile.

CHAPTER XIII.

HEATHCOTE Montfort.

The visit of the unknown cousin had thus become a
very interesting event to the whole household, though
less, perhaps, to its head than to anyone else. Mr.
Montfort flattered himself that he had nothing of
a man's natural repugnance towards his heir. Had
that heir been five-and-twenty, full of the triumph
and confidence of youth, then indeed it might have
been difficult to treat him with the same easy tolerance
; for, whatever may be the chances in your own
favour, it would be difficult to believe that a young
man of twenty five would not, one way or the other,
manage to outlive yourself at sixty. But Heathcote
Montfort had lived, his kinsman thought, very
nearly as long as himself ; he had not been a young
man for these dozen years. It was half a lifetime

VOL. I. s

%

since there had been that silly story about the
Italian lady. Nothing can be more easy than to add
on a few years to the vague estimate of age which
we all form in respect to our neighbours ; the fellow
must be forty if he was a day ; and between forty
and sixty after all there is so little difference, especially
when he of forty is an old bachelor of habits
perhaps not too regular or virtuous. Mr. Montfort
was one of the people who habitually disbelieve in
the virtue of their neighbours. He had never been
a man about town, a frequenter of the clubs, in his
own person ; and there was, perhaps, a spice of envy
in the very bad opinion which he entertained of such
persons. A man of forty used up by late hours and
doubtful habits is not younger  is as a matter of fact
older  than a respectable married man of sixty
taking every care of himself, and regular as clockwork
in all his ways. Therefore he looked with
good-humoured tolerance on Heathcote, at whose
rights under the entail he was almost inclined to
laugh. ' I shall see them all out,' he said to himself 
quay he even permitted himself to say this to his wife,

which was going perhaps too far. Heathcote, to be
sure, had a younger brother; but then he was well
known to be a delicate, consumptive boy.

To the ladies of the family he was more interesting,
for various reasons. Eose and her mother
regarded him with perfectly simple and uncomplicated
views. If he should happen to prove agreeable,
if things fitted in and came right, why then  the
arrangement was one which might have its advantages.
The original estate of Mount which was
comprehended in the entail was not a large one, but
still it was not unworthy consideration, especially
when he had a little and she had a little besides.
Anne, it need not be said, took no such serious
contingency into her thoughts. But she too looked
for Heathcote's arrival with curiosity, almost with
anxiety. He was one who had been as she now was,
and who had fallen  fallen from that high estate.
He had been loved  as Anne felt herself to be loved ;
but he had been betrayed. She thought with awe of
the anguish, the horror of unwilling conviction, the
dying out of all beauty and glory from the worlds
2

which it must have been his to experience. And he
had lived long years since then, on this changed
earth, under these changed skies. She began to
long to see him with a fervour of curiosity which
was mingled with pity and sympathy, and yet a
certain touch of delicate scorn. How could he have
lived after, lived so long, sunk (no doubt) into a
dreamy routine of living, as if mere existence was
worth retaining without hope or love ? She was
more curious about him than she had ever been
about any visitor before, with perhaps a far-off
consciousness that all this might happen to herself,
mingling with the vehement conviction that it never
could happen, that she was as far above it and secure
from it as heaven is from the tempests and troubles
of earth.

The much-expected visitor arrived in the twilight
of an October evening just before dinner, and his
first introduction to the family was in the indistinct
light of the fire  one of the first fires of the season,
which lighted up the drawing-room with a fitful
ruddy blaze shining upon the white dresses of the

girls, but scarcely revealing the elder people in their
darker garments. A man in evening dress very
often looks his best : Jut he does not look romantic
he does not look like a hero  the details of his
appearance are too much like those of everybody else.
Anne, looking at him breathlessly, trying to get a
satisfactory impression of him when the light leaped
up for a moment, found him too vigorous, too large,
too life-like for her fastidious fancy ; but Eose was
made perfectly happy by the appearance of a man
with whom it would not be at all necessary, she
thought, to be upon stilts. The sound of his voice
when he spoke dispersed ever so many visions. It
was not too serious, as the younger sister had feared.
It had not the lofty composure which the elder had
hoped. He gave his arm to Mrs. Montfort with
the air of a man not the least detached from his
fellow-creatures. ' There will be a frost to-night,'
he said ; ' it is very cold outside ; but it is worth
while being out in the cold to come into a cosy room
like this.' Charley Ashley would have said the very
same had it been he who had walked up to dinner

from the rectory. Heathcote bad not been in the
house for years, not perhaps ever since all that had
happened, yet he spoke about the cosy room like any
chance visitor. It would not be too much to say
that there was a certain disgust in the revulsion
with which Anne turned from him, though no doubt
it was premature to pass judgment on him in the
first five minutes like this.

In the light of the dining-room all mystery departed,
and he was seen as he was. A tall man,
strong, and well developed, with dark and very curly
hair tinged all about his temples with grey ; his lips
smiling, his eyes somewhat serious, though kindling
now and then with a habit of turning quickly round
upon the person he was addressing. Four pairs of
eyes were turned upon him with great curiosity ashe
took his seat at Mrs. Montfort's side ; two of
them were satisfied, two not so. This, Mr. Mount-ford
felt, was not the rusty and irregular man about
town, for whom he had felt a contempt ; still he was
turning grey, which shows a feeble constitution. At
sixty the master of Mount had not a grey hair in his

head. As for Anne, this grey hair was the only
satisfactory thing about him. She was not foolish
enough to conclude that it must have turned so in a
single night. But she felt that this at least was
what might be expected. She was at the opposite
side of the table, and could not but give a great deal
of her attention to him. His hair curled in sheer
wantonness of life and vigour, though it was grey ;
his voice was round, and strong, and melodious. Ashe
sat opposite to her he smiled and talked, and
looked like a person who enjoyed his life. Anne for
for her own part scarcely took any part in the conversation
at all. For the first time she threw back
her thoughts upon the Italian princess whom she had
so scorned and condemned. Perhaps, after all, it
was not she who had suffered the least. Anne conjured
up a picture of that forlorn lady sitting somewhere
in a dim solitary room in the heart of a great
silent palace, thinking over that episode of her
youth. Perhaps it was not she, after all, that was so
much in the wrong.

I started from Sandhurst only this morning,' he

was saying, ' after committing all kinds of follies
with the boys. Imagine a respectable person of my
years playing football ! I thought they would have
knocked all the breath out of me : yet you see I
have survived. The young fellows had a match with
men far too strong for them  and I used to have
some little reputation that way in old days '

Oh, yes, you were a great athlete ; you played
for Oxford in University matches, and got ever so
many goals.'

This is startling,' Heathcote said ; ' I did not
know my reputation had travelled before me ; it is a
pity it is not something better worth remembering.
But what do you know about goals, Miss Montfort,
if I may make so bold ? '

Eose,' said that little person, who was wreathed
in smiles ; ' that is Miss Montfort opposite. I am
only the youngest. Oh, I heard from Charley Ashley
all about it. We know about goals perfectly well,
for we used to play ourselves long ago in the holidays
with Charley and Willie  till mamma put a
stop to it,' Rose added, with a sigh.

I should think I put a stop to it ! You played
once, I believe,' said Mrs. Montfort, with a slight
frown, feeling that this was a quite unnecessary confidence.


Oh, much oftener ; don't you recollect, Anne,
you played football too, and you were capital, the
boys said ? '

Now Anne was, in fact, much troubled by this
revelation. She, in lier present superlative condition,
walking about in a halo of higher things, to be
presented to a stranger who was not a stranger, and,
no doubt, would soon hear all about her, as a football
player, a girl who was athletic, a tom-boy,
neither less nor more ! She was about to reply with
annoyance, when the ludicrous aspect of it suddenly
struck her, and she burst into a laugh in spite of
herself. ' There is such a thing as an inconvenient
memory,' she said. ' I am not proud of playing
football now.'

I am not at all ashamed of it,' said Rose. ' I
never should have known what a goal was if I hadn't
played. Do you play tennis, too Mr. Heathcote ?

It is not too cold if you are fond of it. Charley said
you were good at anything  good all round, he said.*
That is a very flattering reputation, and you
must let me thank Mr. Charley, whoever he is, for
sounding my trumpet. But all that was a hundred
years ago,' Heathcote said ; and this made up a
little lost ground for him with Anne, for she thought
she heard something like a sigh.

You will like to try the covers,' said Mr.
Montfort. ' I go out very little myself now-a-days,
and I daresay you begin to feel the damp, too. I
don't preserve so much as I should like to do ; these
girls are always interfering with their false notions ;
but, all the same, I can promise you a few days*
sport.'

Is it the partridges or the poachers that the
young ladies patronise ? ' Heathcote said.

My dear,' said Mrs. Montfort, ' what is the
use of calling attention to Anne's crotchets? She
has her own way of thinking, Mr. Heathcote. I
tell her she must never marry a sportsman. But,
indeed, she has a great deal to say for herself. It

does not seem half so silly when you hear what she
has got to say.'

Anne presented a somewhat indignant countenance
to the laughing glance of the new cousin. She
would not be drawn into saying anything in her own
defence.

You will find a little sport, all the same,' said
Mr. Montfort ; ' but I go out very seldom myself ;
and I should think you must be beginning to feel
the damp, too.'

Not much,' said the younger man, with a laugh.
He was not only athletic and muscular, but conscious
of his strength, and somewhat proud of it. The
vigour in him seemed an affront to all Anne's preconceived
ideas, as it was to her father's comfortable
conviction of the heir's elderliness ; his very looks
seemed to cast defiance at these two discomfited
critics. That poor lady in the Italian palace ! it
could not have been she that was so much in the
wrong, after all.

I like him very much, mamma,' cried Eose,
when they got into the drawing-room ; ' I like him

immensely : he is one of the very nicest men I ever
saw. Do let us make use of him now he is here.
Don't you know that dance you always promised us ?
let us have the dance while Heathcote is here.
Old ! who said he was old ? he is delightful ; and so
nice-looking, and such pretty curly hair.'

Hush, my pet, do not be too rapturous ; he is
very nice, I don't deny ; but still, let us see how he
bears a longer inspection ; one hour at dinner is not
enough to form an opinion. How do you like your
cousin Heathcote, Anne ? '

He is not at all what I expected,' Anne said.

She expected a Don Quixote ; she expected a
Lord Byron, with his collar turned down ; somebody
that talked nothing but poetry. I am so glad, said
Rose, ' he is not like that. I shall not mind Mount
going to Heathcote now. He is just my kind of
man, not Anne's at all.'

No, he is not Anne's kind,' said the mother.

Anne did not say anything. She agreed in their
verdict ; evidently Heathcote was one of those disappointments
of which before she met Cosmo the

world had been full. Many people had excited
generally her curiosity, if not in the same yet in a
similar way, and these had disappointed her altogether.
She did not blame Heathcote. If he was
unable to perceive his own position in the world, and
the attitude that was befitting to him, possibly it
was not his fault. Very likely it was not his fault ;
most probably he did not know any better. You
cannot expect a man to act contrary to his nature,
Anne said to herself; and she gave up Heathcote
with a little gentle disdain. This disdain is the very
soul of toleration. It is so much more easy to put
up with the differences, the discrepancies, of other
people's belief or practice, when you find them
inferior, not to be judged by your standards. This
was what Anne did. She was not angry with him
for not being the Heathcote she had looked for.
She was tolerant : he knew no better ; if you look
for gold in a pebble, it is not the pebble's fault if
you do not find it. This was the mistake she had
made. She went to the other end of the room
where candles were burning on a table and chairs set

out around. It was out of reach of all the chatter
about Heathcote in which she did not agree. She
took a book, and set it up before her to make a screen
before her gaze, and, thus defended, went off at once
into her private sanctuary and thought of Cosmo.
Never was there a transformation scene more easily
managed. The walls of the Mount drawing-room
divided, they gave place to a group of the beeches,
with two figures seated underneath, or to a bit of the
commonplace road, but no longer commonplace  a
road that led to the Manor. What right had a girl
to grumble at her companions, or any of their ways,
when she could escape in the twinkling of an eye into
some such beautiful place, into some such heavenly
company, which was all her own ? But yet there
would come back occasionally, as through a glass, an
image of the Italian lady upon whom she had been
so hard a little while before. Poor Italian lady ! evidently,
after all, Heathcote's life had not been
blighted. Had she, perhaps, instead of injuring
him only blighted her own ?

The softly-lighted room, the interchange of soft

voices at one end, the figure at the other intent
upon a book, lighting up eyes full of dreams, seemed
a sort of enchanted vision of home to Heathcote
Mount ford when, after an interval, he came in alone,
hesitating a little as he crossed the threshold. He
was not used to home. A long time ago his own
house had been closed up at the death of his mother
not so much closed up but that now and then he
went to it with a friend or two, establishing their
bachelorhood in the old faded library and drawing-room,
which could be smoked in, and had few associations.
Bat the woman's part of the place was all
shut up, and he was not used to any woman's part
in his life. This, however, was all feminine ; he
went in as to an enchanted castle. Even Mrs.
Montfort, who was commonplace enough, and little
Eose, who was a pretty little girl and no more,
seemed wonderful creatures to him who had dropped
out of acquaintance with such creatures; and the
elder daughter was something more. He felt a little
shy, middle-aged as he was, as he went in. And this
place had many associations ; one time or other it

would be his own ; one time or other it might come
to pass that he, like his old kinsman, would pass by
the drawing-room, and prefer the ease of the library,
his own chair and his papers. At this idea he laughed
within himself, and went up to Mrs. Montfort on her
sofa, who stopped talking when she saw who it was.

Mr. Montfort has gone to his own room. I
was to tell you he has something to do.'

Oh, papa has always an excuse ! ' cried Rose ;
he never comes here in the evening. I am sure
this room is far nicer, and we are far nicer, than
sitting there all by himself among those musty
books. And he never reads them even ! he puts on
his dressing-gown and sits at his ease '

Hush, you silly child ! When a gentleman comes
to be papa's age he can't be expected to care for the
company of girls, even when they are his own. I
will take my work and sit with him by-and-by.
You must not give your cousin reason to think that
you are undutiful to papa.'

Oh, never mind ! ' said Rose ; ' Mr. Heathcote,
come, and be on my side against mamma. It is so

seldom we have gentlemen staying here  indeed,
there are very few gentlemen in the county  there
are daughters, nothing but daughters, in most of the
houses. And mamma has promised us a dance whenever
we could get enough men. I want her to give
it while you are here.*

While I am here ; but you don't suppose I ama
dancing man ? '

You can dance, I am sure,' said Eose. ' I can
see it in your face; and then you would make
acquaintance with all the neighbours. It would be
dreadful when you come to live here after our time
if you do not know a soul. You must make acquaintance
with everybody; and it would be far
more fun to have a ball than a quantity of dreary
dinner-parties. Do come here and be on my side
against mamma ! '

How can I be against my kind kinswoman,'
he said laughing, ' who has taken me in and received
me so graciously, though I belong to the other
branch ? That would be ingratitude of the basest
sort.'

VOL. I. T

Then you must be against me,' said Rose.
That would be impossible ! ' he said, with another
laugh ; and drew his chair close to the table
and threw himself into the discussion. Rose's bright
little countenance lighted up, her blue eyes shone,
her cheeks glowed. She got a piece of paper and a
pencil, and began to reckon up who could be invited.
The men first,' she said, with the deepest gravity,
furtively applying her pencil to her lips to make it
mark the blacker as in old school-room days ; ' the
men must go down first, for we are always sure of
plenty of girls  but you cannot have a dance without
men. First of all, I will put down you. You
are one to start with  Mr. Heathcote Montfort ;
how funny it is to have a gentleman of the same
name, who is not papa ! '

Ah ! that is because you never had a brother ! '
said Mrs. Montfort, with a sigh ; ' it never seemed
at all strange to us at home. I beg your pardon, I
am sure, Mr. Heathcote ; of course it would have
interfered with you ; but for girls not to have a

brother is sad for them, poor things! It always
makes a great deal of difference in a girl's life.'

What am I to say ? ' asked Heathcote. ' I am
very sorry, but  how can I be sorry when I have
just become conscious of my privileges ; it is an
extremely pleasant thing to step into this vacant
post.'

A second cousin is not like a brother,' said
Rose ; * but, anyhow, at a dance you would be the
man of the house. And you do dance ? if you don't
you must learn before the ball. We will teach you,
Anne and I.'

I can dance a little, but I have no doubt lessons
would do me good. Now go on ; I want to see my
comrades and coadjutors.'

Rose paused with her pencil in her hand. ' Mr.
Heathcote Montfort, that is one ; that is a great
thing to begin with. And then there is  then
there is  who shall I put down next ? who is there
else, mamma ? Of chuse Charley Ashley ; but he is
a clergyman, he scarcely counts. That is why a
garden party is better than a dance in the country,

T 2

because the clergymen all count for that. I think
there is somebody staying with the Woodheads, and
there is sure to be half-a-dozen at Meadowlands ;
shall I put down six for Meadowlands ? They must
invite some one if they have not so many ; all our
friends must invite some one  we must insist upon
it,' Rose said.

My dear, that is always the difficulty ; you
know that is why we have had to give it up so often.
In the vacation there is Willie Ashley, he is always
somebody.'

He must come,' cried Rose, energetically, ' for
three days  that will be enough  for three days ;
Charley must write and tell him. And then there is
who is there more, mamma ? Mr. Heath cote
Montfort, that is an excellent beginning, and he is
an excellent dancer, and will go on all the evening
through, and dance with everybody. Still, we cannot
give a ball with only one man.'

I will send for my brother and some more of
those young fellows from Sandhurst, Mrs. Montfort,
if you can put them up.'

If we can put them up ! ' Rose all but threw
herself into the arms of this new cousin, her eyes all
but filled with tears of gratitude. She gave a little
shriek of eagerness  ' Of course we can put them up ;
oh ! as many as ever you please, as many as you can
get :  shall I put down twenty for Sandhurst ?
Now we have a real ball in a moment,' said Rose,
with enthusiasm. It had been the object of her
desires all her life.

Does Miss Montfort take no interest in the
dance ? ' Heathcote asked.

Anne ? Oh, she will take it up when it comes
near the time. She will do a great deal ; she will
arrange everything ; but she does not take any pleasure
in planning ; and then,' said Rose, dropping her
voice to a whisper  ' Hush ! don't look to make her
think we are talking of her ; she does not like to be
talked of  Mr. Heathcote ! Anne is  engaged.'

My dear child ! ' cried her mother. ' Mr. Heath-cote,
this is all nonsense ; you must not pay the
least attention to what this silly child says. Engaged
!  what folly. Rose ! you know your sister is

nothing of the kind. It is nothing hut imagination ;
it is only your nonsense, it is '

You wouldn't dare, mamma, to say that to
Anne,' said Eose, with a very solemn face.

Dare ! I hope I should dare to say anything to
Anne. Mr. Heathcote will think we are a strange
family when the mother wouldn't dare to say anything
to the daughter, and her own child taunts her
with it. I don't know what Mr. Heathcote would
think of us,' said Mrs Montfort, vehemently, ' if he
believed what you said.'

I do not think anything but what you tell me,'
said Heathcote, endeavouring to smooth the troubled
waters. ' I know there are family difficulties everywhere.
Pray don't think of making explanations.
I am sure whatever you do will be kind, and whatever
Miss Montfort does will spring from a generous
heart. One needs only to look at her to see
that.'

Neither of the ladies thought he had paid any
attention to Anne, and they were surprised  for it
had not occurred to them that Anne, preoccupied as

she was, could have any interest for the new comer.
They were startled by the quite unfounded confidence
in Anne which he thus took it upon him to profess.
They exchanged looks of surprise. ' Yes, Anne hasa
generous heart  no one can deny that,' Mrs.
Montfort said. It was in the tone of a half-unwilling
admission, but it was all the more effective on
that account. Anne had listened to their voices,
half-pleased thus to escape interruption, half-disgusted
to have more and more proofs of the frivolity
of the new comer ; she had heard a sentence now and
then, an exclamation from Rose, and had been much
amused by them. She was more startled by the
cessation of the sounds, by the sudden fall, the
whispering, the undertones, than by the conversation.
What could they be talking of now, and why should
they whisper as if there were secrets in hand?
Next minute, however, when she was almost roused
to the point of getting up to see what it was, Mi'S.
Montfort's voice became audible again.

Do you sing now, Mr. Heathcote ? I remember
long ago you used to have a charming voice ! '

I don't know that it was ever very charming ;
but such as it is I have the remains of it,' he said.

Then come and sing something,' said Mrs.
Montfort. What was it they had been saying
which broke off so suddenly, and occasioned this
jump to a different subject? But Anne composed
herself to her dreams. again, when she saw the group
moving towards the piano. He sang, too, then!
sang and danced and played football, after what had
happened to him ? Decidedly, the Italian princess
must have had much to be said on her side.

THE Spectator's VIEW.

A FEW days passed, and the new cousin continued to
be very popular at Mount. Mrs. Montfort made
no secret of her liking for him.

Of course,' she said, ' I was never partial to the
other branch, especially having no son myself. The
Mount family has never liked them. Though they
have always been poor, they have claimed to be the
elder branch, and when your property is to go away
from you without any fault of yours, nati-ally you
are not fond of those to whom it goes. But with
Heathcote one forgets all these prejudices. He is so
thoroughly nice, he is so affectionate. He has no

VOL. II. B

family of his own (unless you call his delicate
brother a family), and anyone can see how he likes
ladies' society. Mr. Montfort thinks as much of
him as we do. I quite look forward to introducing
him to our friends ; and I hope he may get to be
popular in the county for now that we have made
such friends with him, he will be often here I trust.'
Such was the excellent opinion his cousin's wife
expressed of him. It is needless to say that her
neighbours imputed motives to poor Mrs. Montfort,
arid jumped at the cause of her partiality. ' She
means him to marry Eose,' everybody said ; and
some applauded her prudence ; and some denounced
her selfishness in sacrificing Eose to a man old
enough to be her father ; but, on the whole, the
county approved both the man himself and the
opportunity of making his acquaintance. He was
asked to dinner at Meadowlands, which was all that
could be desired for any visitor in the neighbourhood.
The Mountfords felt that they had done their utmost
for any guest of theirs when they had procured them
this gratification. And Lord Meadowlands quite

took to ' Heathcote. This was the best thing that
could happen to anyone new to the county, the sort
of thing on which the other members of society congratulated
each other when the neophyte was a
favourite, taking each other into corners and saying :
He has been a great deal at the Castle,' or ' He has
been taken up by Lord Meadowlands.' Thus the
reception given to the heir of entail was in every
way satisfactory, and even !Mr. Montfort himself
got to like him. The only one who kept aloof was
Anne, who was at this moment very much preoccupied
with her own thoughts ; but it was not from
any dislike to the new member of the household.
He had not fulfilled her expectations. But that
most probably was not his fault. And, granting the
utter want of delicate perception in him, and understanding
of the role which ought to have bee n his in
the circumstances, Anne, after a few days, came to
think tolerably well of her new kinsman. He was
intelligent : he could talk of things which the others
rejected as nonsense or condemned as highflown.
On the question of the cottages, for instance, he had

B 2

shown great good sense ; and on the whole, though
with indifference, Anne conceded a general approval
to him. But they did not draw together, or so at
least the other members of the family thought.
Rose monopolised him when he was in the drawing-room.
She challenged him at every turn, as a very
young and innocent girl may do, out of mere high
spirits, without conscious coquetry at least : she contradicted
him and defied him, and adopted his
opinions and scoffed at them by turns, keeping him
occupied, with an instinctive art which was quite
artless, and meant ' fun ' more than anything serious.
At all this pretty play Anne looked on without
seeing it, having her head full of other things. And
the mother looked on, half-afraid, half-disapproving
(as being herself of a stricter school and older fashion),
yet not sufficiently afraid or displeased to interfere ;
while Heathcote himself was amused, and did not
object to the kittenish sport of the pretty little girl,
whose father (he saidto himself) he might have been,
so far as age went. But he kept an eye, notwithstanding,
on ' the other girl,' whom he did not

understand. That she was * engaged,' and yet not
permitted to be spoken of as ' engaged '  that there
was some mystery about her  was evident. A suspicion
of a hidden story excites every observer.
Heathcote wanted to find it out, as all of us would
have done. As for himself, he was not incapable of
higher sentiments, though Anne had easily set him
down as being so : but his experiences had not been
confined to one romantic episode, as she, in her
youthful ignorance, had supposed. The story was
true enough, but with a difference. The Italian
princess was not a noble lady compelled to wed in
her own rank and relinquish her young Englishman,
as Mrs. Montfort had recounted it, but a poor girl
of much homelier gentility, whose lot had been fixed
long before Heathcote traversed her simple path, and
who fulfilled that lot with a few tears but not very
much reluctance, much more in the spirit of Leviathan
of Anne. Heathcote himself looked back upon
the little incident with a smile. He would have
gone to the ends of the earth to serve her had she
wanted his help, but he did not regret that Antonio

had not been his wife all these years. Perhaps he
would have required a moment's reflection to think
what anyone could mean who referred to this story.
But even the fact that such an episode was of no
special importance in his life would have been against
him with Anne in the present state of her thoughts.
She would not have allowed it as possible or right
that a man should have gone beyond the simplicity
of such an incident. In her experience love was as
yet the first great fact, the one enlightener, awakener
of existence. It had changed her own life from the
foundation, nay, had given her an individual, separate
life, as she fondly thought, such as, without this
enchantment, no one could have. But Heathcote
had lived a great deal longer, had seen a great deal
more. He had been ' knocked about,' as people say.
He had seen the futility of a great many things
upon which simple people set their hopes ; he had
come to be not very solicitous about much which
seems deeply important to youth. Thirty-five had
worked upon him its usual influence. But of all this
Anne knew nothing, and she put him aside as a

problem not worth solution, as a being whose deficiencies
were deficiencies of nature. She was more
interesting to him. She was the only one of the
house who was not evident on the surface. And his
interest was stimulated by natural curiosity. He
wanted to know what the story was which the child-sister
referred to so frankly, which the mother
wanted to ignore. There was even a something in
the intercourse between Anne and her father which
caught his attention. They were on perfectly good
terms  but what was it ? He was a man who took
things as they came, who did not feel a very profound
interest in anything  save one thing. But
this little mystery reflected in Anne's serious eyes,
and pervading the house with a sense of something
not apparent, roused the dormant sentiment more
than he could have thought possible.

The one thing that interested Heathcote Mount-ford
to the bottom of his heart was his young
brother, for whom he had a tender, semi-parental
passion, preferring his concerns above everything else
in the world. It was this, indeed, which had

brought him to Mount with a proposal which he
could not but feel that Mr. Montfort would grasp
at. He had come to offer to his predecessor in the
entail that they should join together and break it a
singular step for an heir in his position to take. But
as yet he had said nothing about this chief object of
his visit. When he formed the project it had not
cost him much. What did he want with an estate
and a big house to keep up, he had said to himself
in the snugness of his bachelor's chambers, so much
more comfortable than Mount, or any other such big
barrack of a place could ever be made ? He had
already a shabby old house to which he went now
and then to shoot, and which  because Edward (not
to speak of himself) had been born in it, and their
mother had died in it, as well as many generations
of Edwards and Heathcotes in the past  could not
be done away with, however melancholy and dismal
it might get to be. But Mount had no associations
for him. Why should not St. John's girls have it,
as was just and natural ? The Mountfords of Mount
were not anything so very great that heaven and

earth should be moved to keep them up. Besides, he
would not be of much use in keeping them up ; he
never meant to marry (not because of Antonio, but
probably because of ' knocking about ' and forgetting
that any one thing in the world was more important
than any other), and Edward was delicate, and there
was no telling what the boy might do ;  far better to
have a good sum of money, to set that wayward
fellow above the reach of trouble, and leave it to St.
John's girls to provide for the race. Xo doubt they
would do that fast enough. They would marry, and
their children could take the name. Thus he had
his plans all cut and dry before he reached Mount.
But when he got there, either the reserve of Mr.
Montfort's maimer, or some certain charm in the
place which he had not anticipated, deferred the
execution of it. He thought it over and arranged
all the details during each day's shooting, notwithstanding
that the gamekeepers insisted all the time
on discoursing with him upon the estate, and pointing
out what should be done under a new reign which
the present master did not care to have done ; but in

the evening he was too tired (he said to himself) to
open so important a subject ; and thus day after day
went on. Perhaps the discourses even of the gamekeepers,
and their eagerness to point out to him the
evils that were to be amended at presumably the not
very distant period when a new monarch should
Reign, and the welcome he received from the people
he met, and the success he had at Meadowlands, and
the interest which he excited in the county, had
something to do with the disinclination to open the
subject which seemed to have crept upon him ; or
probably it was only laziness. This was the reason
which he assigned to himself  indolence of mind,
which was one of his besetting sins he knew. But,
anyhow, whatever was the cause, he had as yet said
nothing on the subject. He had accepted all the
allusions that were made to his future connection with
the county, and the overtures of friendship ; and he
had owned himself flattered by the attentions of Lord
Meadowlands : everything had gone indeed precisely as
things might have gone had he fully accepted his position
as heir of the Mountfords. Nobody for a moment

doubted that position : and still he did nothing to undeceive
them, nothing to show his real disinclination to
assume the burden of the ownership of Mount. Was
he really so disinclined to accept it? After this
week of the new Hfe his head seemed confused on
the subject, and he was not quite so sure.

But all the same he felt instinctively that Anne
would make a far better squire than he should. He
had gone through the village with the girls, and he
had seen how everything centred in Anne. Though
there was (he thought) a certain severity in her, the
village people evidently did not feel it. They were
more at home with her than even with her little
sister. The Rector came up to her in the street,
and put his arm within hers, and led her away to see
something which had to be done, with a mixture of
authority and appeal which touched the looker-on.
JNIr. Ashley was old and feeble, and there was something
pretty in the way in which he supported
himself at once physically and morally on the young,
slim, elastic strength of the girl, who was the natural
born princess of the place. At the schools she was

supreme. Wherever she went, it was evidently
recognised that she was the representative at once of
law and of power. Heathcote, who had not been
used to it, looked upon her with surprise and a wondering
admiration. ' You are in great demand,' he
said. ' You have a great deal to do. You seem to
have the government of the place in your hands.'

Papa is not so active as he used to be,' Anne
said. ' Besides, there are so many little things which
come more naturally to me.'

You are princess regent,' he said : ' I see ; you
act for the king, but you are more than the king. A
man could never do that.'

Men can do a great deal more than women in
everything,' said Anne, with decision.

Oh ! can they ? I should not have said so ; but
no doubt you know best.'

If they cannot, what is the meaning of everything
that is said in the world, Mr, Heathcote ? you
would have to change the entire language. We are
never supposed to be good for anything. What is
life to us is supposed to be an amusement to you.'

This is a new light,' said Heathcote, somewhat
startled. He had no idea that it was poor Antonio, the
mother of half a dozen children, who was in Anne's
mind aU the time.

Anne, don't ! Mamma says you should never
talk like that to gentlemen ; they will think you go
in for women's rights and all sorts of horrible things.
She doesn't, cousin Heathcote. She only wants to
make you stare.'

I think I go in for everybody's rights ; I don't
mind whether they are women or men,' said Anne.
'Mrs. Fisher, what is the matter? The children
don't come to school, and Johnny has left the choir.
There must be some reason for aU that.'

miss Anne,' said the woman, with a smirk and
a curtsey, ' Johnny's been in the rectory kitchen
learning to be a boy. Mr. Douglas, miss, that was
stopping at the rectory, took a fancy to him, and old
Sines is a-training of him. Mr. Douglas, that's the
gentleman  is going to have him at his house in
town, !Miss Anne. You knows him, Johnny says.'

At this Rose gave vent to a suppressed giggle.

and the woman smirked more broadly than ever.
But these signs might not have caught the attention
of Heathcote but for the violent flush which he saw
overspread Anne's face. His attention was roused on
the moment.

Mr. Douglas has been gone for some time,' he
heard Anne say. A note had got into her voice that
had not been there before  a softness, a roundness, a
melting of the tones. Mr. Douglas !  who was he ?
Heathcote said who was the fellow ? within himself
with an instinctive opposition. ' The fellow ' had
nothing whatever to do with him, yet he disliked
him at once.

Yes, Miss Anne ; but Johnny has been in the
rectory kitchen a-training ever since the gentleman
went away.'

Anne made the woman a little friendly sign with
her hand and went on. She did not pursue her
inquiries as officer of the school any more : she
accepted the excuse, though it was no excuse ; which
showed, be said to himself with a smile, how efficient
female officers of school boards would be. Perhaps

she was half humbled by this evidence of being toa
easily satisfied. She volunteered a profession of her
faith.

I do not approve of too stringent measures :
you ought not to set up one arbitrary rule ; you
ought to take the circumstances into consideration.*
All this was said with a little heat. ' I suppose why
school boards have been so unpopular where they
exist is very much because of that.'

Again a little giggle escaped from the bosom of
Eose ; but it was quickly suppressed. She gave
Heathcote a significant look, as Anne was stopped by
some one else who wanted to speak to her. ' That
was the gentleman Rose whispered, with mischievous
delight.

Well, if it was the gentleman I Heathcote
thought, he was a lucky fellow ; but the idea of
giving up Mount was from that moment less pleasant,
he could scarcely tell why. He did not relish the
notion of some fellow called Douglas, probably some
Scotsman who would not part with his very ordinary
name for a king's ransom, coming into possession of

the old place. Who was Douglas ? On the whole,
Heathcote for the first time acknowledged to himself
that there might be two sides to the question, and
that there was something wrong and faithless in
separating the old name of Montfort and the
male heir from Mount.

Next day, however, by accident further light was
thrown to him on this question. The principal post
came in at noon, and it was the habit of the house
that the letters which came by it should be ranged
upon one of the tables in the hal], in little heaps,
where their respective owners found them. Coming
in to get his share of the budget, Heathcote found
that Mr. Montfort was there before him. He had
his letters in his left hand, but with his right had
taken up another which lay on Anne's heap. He
was balancing it in his fingers half-contemptuous,
half-angry, when Heathcote, with the involuntary
indiscretion which so often belongs to the innocent,
knowing no reason why anything should be done in
secret, paused behind him, and saw at a glance what
he was about. It was not anything tragical : Mr.

Montfort had no intention of tampering with
Anne's letter : but he held it up, and turned it over,
and looked at it all round with a look of disgust on
his countenance. By this time Heathcote had been
awakened to the sense that he was prying into a
domestic mystery, he who had no right to do so, and
he hastened to gather his own letters from the table.
Mrs. Montfort by this time had come in, on the
same errand. Her husband held the letter up to her
with an indignant ' humph I ' 'Do you see ? She
is keeping it up in spite of all I have said.'

'I don't want to see it,' said the stepmother,
nervously ; ' put it down. I have nothing to do with
Anne's letters, papa ! '

And then a sort of sensation spread through the
room, he could not tell what, and Heathcote became
aware that Anne herself had come in. She walked
straight to the table where her father stood, still
with her letter in his hand. She recognised it in his
hand with a sudden flush of consciousness, and stood
facing him, saying nothing, pale now, but with
courage, not fear.

VOL. II. c

This is for you apparently, Anne ; you are
keeping up the correspondence whatever I may say.'

Yes, papa, I am keeping it up.' She put out
her hand and took the letter. She made no explanation
or excuse ; but went away with it, slowly, with
a sort of formal dignity. It was a strange little
scene. The observer seemed to see the story rising
like a picture before him  as Anne had thought she
saw his story  but more distinctly as being more
near. He was more interested than he could say.
He had no right to inquire into what was so distinctly
a family secret. If she only would have confided
in him, told him how it was !  but that he had
no right to expect. It made a visible commotion in
the house for the rest of the day. Little signs of
agitation were visible, signs which without this
elucidation would only have puzzled, would have
conveyed no enlightenment to his mind. Anne did
not appear at lunch. She had gone, it was said, to
the village, and no doubt had stopped to luncheon
with the Woodheads. And Mr. Montfort was
gloomy and absent, yet at the same time more alert

than usual. ' I am going to ride over to Hunston
this afternoon,' he announced. ' Perhaps you would
like to go with me, Heathcote, and see the place ? '

V<rhsit are you going to do at Hunston, papa ?
Let me come with you too : let us all go together,'
said Eose.

I am going to see Mr. Loseby,' her father said ;
and this, though it had no effect upon Eose, made
her mother start slightly, and cast an anxious look
towards the head of the table.

Do you think, St. John, it is a good day to go to
Hunston ? It is very damp, and I am sure you will
make your cold worse.'

jVIrs. Montfort was not the soul of generosity :
but she was far from being unjust or cruel. She
was afraid of what her husband might be going to do,
even should it be for the advantage of Eose.

I think I can manage to take care of my cold,'
he said.

But that is just what gentlemen never do.
Don't go to-day, St. John. Wait till it is drier
and brighter ; ' she even got up from her chair and
c 2

went round to him and put her hand on his shoulder,
Wait till you have had time to think.'

I have taken too much time to think,' he said
crossly, turning away his head and rising from the
table. ' Heathcote, if you would like to come with
me, I shall be ready in half-an-hour.'

What is it, mamma ? ' said Eose, half frightened
too, as her father went out of the room. Mrs,
Montfort  the spectator always thought the better
of her for it  fell a-crying, without being able to
restrain herself, half in real distress, half in nervous
excitement. ' Oh, Mr. Heathcote, if you can do
anything to smoothe him down, do so ; I am afraid
he is going to  to tamper with his will ! ' she cried.

CHAPTER XV.

Tampering WITH A LAWYER.

The road to Hunston was a pleasant road. They
went through the park first, which was in all the
glory of autumn colouring, the oaks and the beeches
a wonder to see, and even the slim elms all golden
standing up against a blue afternoon sky, in which
already there began to appear faint beg-innings of
purple and crimson as the sun got westward ; and
after that the road ran between other parks, and more
and more wealth of russet or of golden foliage. But
]mr. ]\Iountford was not a very entertaining companion.
Heathcote when he was ' at home ' was in
very good society  in society, that is to say, which
was agreeable, where there was much talk and great
freedom of intercourse, and since he had been at
Mount he had found pleasure in the society of the

girls, one of whom amused him, while one interested
him. Mr. Montfort, however, did neither the one
nor the other. He indicated the different houses with
his riding whip as they passed.

That's Newton-Magna. The Newton once contested
the county with us. My grandfather married a
Newton  they are, therefore, connections. This is
where old Lady Prayer Poule lives. She has just
made a ridiculous marriage, of which everybody is
talking. I don't know who the man is. There is
Meadowlands to the right, and that's young Russell's
place, whom I suppose you have heard of.'

This was the style of his conversation. Sometimes
he varied it by giving his kinsman an account
of the value of the livings and the goodness of the
land.

It is worth so much an acre on this side of the
river, and not half on the other side. The land up
my way is generally good, and the livings are excellent.
In my parish the living has always been held
by a younger son, but naturally there has been no
younger son. Ah ! you think that Edward ;  well.

if I had known more of Edward, I might perhaps 
but he is quite young ; there is plenty of time.'

Between the intervals, however, when he was not
engaged with these local details, Mr. Montfort had
not much to say. He was not brilliant in himself,
and he was preoccupied. He had all the air of a
man who was going, as his wife said, to tamper with
his will. When his companion spoke to him he
gave short answers : his thoughts were somewhere
else. When they approached the town he became
still more brief in his indications.

The church is considered fine, I believe, and the
High Street is a nice street. I am going to Loseby's,
who is my lawyer. He has had all the Mount affairs
in his hands since ever I can remember, and much
longer  he and his father before him. He'll like to
make your acquaintance ; but in the meantime I
have some business with him. Perhaps you would
like to look about the town a little.'

Heathcote said he would like to look about the
town, and Mr. Montfort, evidently gathering himself
up with an effort, buttoned up a button which

had come undone of his coat, and with a very determined
air strode into the lawyer's office. It was
part of a tall red brick house, which formed an
important feature in the scene, a house with many
rows of windows, long and narrow, which twinkled
in the setting sun. In Heathcote's mind there was
a great deal of mingled curiosity and sympathy.
He would have liked to know what was going to
happen, to be behind Mr. Loseby's curtains, or in
some cupboard full of parchments. There could be
no doubt that something affecting Anne's future
was in the wind. He laughed at himself, after a
mom went, to think how much importance, how much
gravity he was attaching to it. After all, he said to
himself, as Cosmo had done before, tyrannical fathers
are a thing of the past  nobody cuts off a child
now-a-days with a shilling. No doubt all Mr. Mount-ford
meant was to tie up her money so that no
worthless fellow of a husband could get at it. But,
though he felt that this was the only reasonable
interpretation of Mr. Montfort's mission, yet the
various little scenes he had been a witness to made

an impression upon his mind in spite of himself.
Anne standing grave and simple, facing her father,
holding out her hand for her letter, saying, ' Yes, I
keep it up '  was it undutiful of the girl ? and the
father's stern displeasure and the mother's (or stepmother
was it ? all the more credit to her) excitement
and distress. To be sure a family quarrel
always threw a house into agitation, even where no
great harm was to be looked for. Xo doubt it was
undutiful of the girl. After all, if a parent is not to
have influence on that point, where is the use of
him ? And no doubt she had chosen a man unworthy
of her, or such a fuss never would have been
made. Heathcote was not a parent, but still he had
in some respects the responsibilities of a parent.
Edward was delicate  he was not strong enough to
fight his way against the world; but he was not
amiable, the quality which ought to belong to all
delicate and weakly persons, and which makes up
for so many deficiencies. He had strong passions
in his weak body. He had akeady got into various
scrapes, out of which his brother had been called

upon to draw him. Heathcote had a letter in his
pocket now which had given him a great deal of
thought. It had drawn him hack to his former
conviction that Edward's affairs were the most
important in the world. It vias not in his power by
himself to do all that Edward wanted, to secure the
boy's comfort, so far as that was possible. He must
speak to Mr. Montfort on the ride home. It was
not a thing to be neglected any longer. This was
the chief thing in his mind as he walked about
Hunston, looking into the old church and surveying
all the shops. He ' made acquaintance,' as his kinsman
had bidden him, with the quiet little county
town, with a curious mingling of ideas in his mind.
In the first place, he could not but think how many
generations of Mountfords had trodden this pavement
 ladies in farthingales and men in periwigs,
bucks of the Regency, sober politicians of the period
of Reform ; and by-and-by it would be his own turn
he too in his day would ride in on a steady-going
old cob, like St. John Montfort, or drive in the
family coach to see his lawyer and his banker and

do his business. But no  he contradicted himself
with a little confusion  no, this was just what he
was not to do. For the moment he had forgotten
his own purpose, the object that brought him to the
old home of the race  which was to sever himself
from it. No, after all, he said to himself with a
smile," there was not very much to give up ; the
pleasure of riding into the county town and receiving
the respectful salutations of all the shopkeepers:
that was not much. The Albany was a better place
to live in, Piccadilly was a little more entertaining
than the High Street. Nevertheless, it was certain
that Heathcote felt a pinch of regret when he
remembered that the glories of Mount and the
greetings of Hunston were not to be his. He
laughed, but he did not like it. All the more was it
essential that this step should be taken without
delay.

Heathcote examined everything there was to see
in the place, and walked three or four times from
one end to another of the High Street, awakening
the greatest curiosity in the bosoms of all the shopkeepers,

and a flutter of futile hope and expectation
behind the bonnets in the milliner's windows, where
Miss Trimming's niece took this novel apparition for
the hero of her last romance. That a gentleman
should see a face at a window, and walk up and
down High Street for an hour for the chance of
another glimpse of it, was not at all an out-of-the-way
event for the readers of the ' Family Herald ' 
much more likely than that he should be waiting
for Mr. Montfort. When, however, the master of
Mount appeared at last, he bore all the outward
signs of a prolonged combat. His hair was rubbed
up off his forehead, so that his hat rested upon
the ends of it, not upon his head. His eyes were
agitated and rolling. Mr. Loseby, a little stout old
gentleman, with a large watchman and seals, came
out after him with similar signs of commotion. The
family lawyer was red and breathless, while his
companion was choked and pale. They came out
together with that air of formal politeness which
follows a quarrel, to the door.

'Heathcote,' Mr. Montfort called, holding up

his hand ; ' this is ]Mr. Loseby, whose name must be
known to you as the man of business of my family
for several generations. We have always had the
utmost confidence in them, as they have always done
their best for us.'

After such an introduction,' said Mr. Loseby,
I ought to make a bow and hope for the continuance
of custom and favour, which my best efforts will be
exerted to deserve.'

And then there was a forced laugh, in which
some of the resentment of the two elder men fortunately
blew off. They stood together in a circle at
the door of the Queen Anne Mansion. Mr. Loseby
only wore no hat. He was bald and round and
shining all over, a man to whom genial good-hum our
was evidently more natural than the air of heat and
irritation which was upon him now.

I hope we are to see something of h. Heath-cote
Montfort in the county after this. I hope
you mean to make acquaintance with yom neighbours,
and feel yourself at home. The name of
Montfort is a passport here.' (' Though I don't

know why it should be  obstinate asses ! pig-headed
fools ! ' the puffing little lawyer said to himself. )

I am here on false pretences,' Heathcote said.
I fear I have been taking in my cousin and his
family and all their excellent friends. I may as
well tell it at last. My real object in coming was
rather to sever myself from the county than to draw
the bond tighter '

What do you mean ? ' said Mr. Montfort,
abruptly.

Forgive me for saying nothing about it before.
This is a good opportunity now, when we have Mr.
Loseby's assistance. I came with the express intention
of making a proposal to you, St. John, about
the entail.'

Mr. Loseby looked first at the speaker and then
at his client, forming his lips into a round, as if he
would have said, ' Whew-w ! This was something
altogether new."

Mr. Montfort took no notice of his look ; he
said, still more abruptly than before, ' What about
the entail ? '

Pardon me if I say it,' said Heathcote. * Mount
is quite new to me , it does not attract me ' (what a
fib that was, he felt in his heart). ' I shall never
marry. I have suffered the time for forming new
connections to pass, and my brother has indifferent
health and no liking for country life. On the other
hand, it is natural that my cousin should prefer to
be succeeded by his own family. WTiat I have to
say is that I am very willing, if you like it, to join
with you in breaking the entail.'

In breaking the entail ! ' Mr. Loseby's mouth
grew rounder and rounder ; he seemed to be forming
one whistle after another, which came to nothing.
But he did not take time to express his own surprise
or his own opinion, so much was he occupied in
watching the effect of this announcement upon INIr.
Montfort. The latter was dumb foundered ; he
stood and stared at the speaker with blank dismay
and consternation. But it did not apparently
produce any livelier or happier impression upon his
mind. He was not eager to snatch at the opportunity
of putting his own child in his place.

You must be cracked,' he said ; ' do you know-how
long the Mountfords have been at Mount ? 
the oldest house in the county, and, if not the
richest or the largest, in some ways by far the most
interesting. Heathcote, there must be something
under this. If you are pressed for money, if there
is anything you want to do, I dare say Loseby will
manage it for you.'

I will do anything that is in reason,' Mr.
Loseby said, not without a little emphasis which
brought a tinge of red on his client's countenance.
They could not yet give up their duel with each
other, however important the other communication
might be.

'Heathcote Montfort will not ask you to do
anything out of reason,' cried the other ; ' and incase
he should exceed that limit, here am I ready to
be his security. No, we must not hear anything
more about breaking the entail.'

I am afraid you must consent to hear something
more,' said Heathcote, half pleased, half angry ;
it is not a sudden fancy. I have considered it

thoroughly; there are numberless advantages, and,
so far as I can see, nothing of substantial weight to
be brought forward on the other side.'

Oh come, this is too much I ' cried the lawyer,
moved to professional interest ; ' nothing on the
other side ! But this is not a place to discuss so
serious a subject. Step into my office, and let us
have it out.'

I have had enough of your office for one day,'
said Mr. Montfort (at which the lawyer barely
restrained a chuckle) ; 'I have had quite enough of
your office, I'll go and see about the horses. If
there is anything wrong, Heathcote, have it out, ashe
says, with Loseby. He'll make it all right for
you. He may not always be satisfactory to deal
with for those who prefer to judge for themselves
sometimes ; but if it is anything you want, he'll
give you trustworthy advice.'

Thank you for your good word, squire,' said
the lawyer, laughing and putting his hand to his
forehead with the duck of a country bumpkin.

VOL. II. D

Now take a seat,' he added, as he led the stranger
into a trim wainscoted room with cupboards hid
behind half the panels, and the secrets of half the
families of the county in them, ' and let us talk this
over. I cannot understand why Montfort does not
jump at it (yes, I do ; I can understand, now), but
why you should wish to do it ! Pardon me, if I say
on your side it is mere madness. What good can
it do you ? If you want money, as your cousin says, I
can get you as much money as you like  at least,*
he said, pausing to survey him with dubious looks,
as if with a momentary apprehension that his new
acquaintance might turn out a sporting man in
difficulties or something of that disreputable kind,
almost as much as you like.'

'I do want money,' Heathcote said, 'but I do
not want it unless I give a fair equivalent. The
entail is of no advantage to me. I live in London.
I do not want to keep up the faded glories of a place
ia the country.'

Faded glories ! We thought, on the contrary,
everything was as fine as in the Queen's palace, and

all new,' cried Mr. Loseby, with his favourite restrained
whistle of comic surprise.

I have a place of my own,' said Heathcote, ' a
poor one, I allow, but enough for my requirements.
I am not a marrying man, and very likely, G-od
knows, to be the last of my family ; what do I want
with an entailed estate ? '

But that is so easily remedied,' said the lawyer.
Marry  marry, my dear sir ! and you will no longer
be the last of your family, and will very soon learn

to appreciate an entailed estate. By ! ' cried

Mr. Loseby, rubbing his hands. He would not say
By Jove ! ' or even ' By George I ' or anything of
the sort, which would have been unbecoming his
years and dignity ; but when things were too many

for him, he swore ' By 1 ' and was refreshed. ' I

could tell you a thing to do,' cried the lawyer, with
a chuckle, ' that would save the family from a great
deal of trouble. AMiat do you think that obstinate
I beg your pardon, Mr. Heathcote, he and I are
old friends, we say what we please to each other ? 
what do you suppose he has been doing here ? 

D 2

trying to force me, against all the teachings of
reason, to alter his will  to cut off that fine girl,
that delightful creature, Anne.'

Mr. Loseby, I don't suppose this is a thing
which I am intended to know.'

You will know, sooner or later, if he carries it
out,' cried the lawyer ; but you are right, I have no
business to betray my client's affairs. But, look
here now,' he said, bending across the table, leaning
on both his elbows to look insinuatingly, coaxingly
in Heathcote's face, ' look here now ! I never saw
you before, Mr. Heathcote, but your name is as
familiar to me as my a, b, c, and I am a very old family
friend, as I may say, as well as their man of business*
Look here now. You are a very personable man,
and not a bit too old for her, and a most suitable
match in every way. Why shouldn't you make upto
Anne ? Hear me out, and don't flare up. Bless
you, I am not a stranger, nor a mere impudent
country attorney, as perhaps you are thinking. I
knew them all before they were born. Anne is
perhaps a little serious, you will think, a little high-saluting.

But nobody knows till they do know her
what a fine creature she is. Anne Montfort is a
wife for a king. And here she's got entangled with
some fellow whom nobody knows, and loimtford of
course refuses his consent. But she is not the girl
to be bullied or treated with severity. Why couldn't
you go in now and try for Anne ? You are not to be
supposed to know anything about it ; it would all be
innocence in you ; and who knows that she oughtn't
be glad of the chance of slipping out of the other,
though she won't give in to threats. Won't you
think of it? Won't you think of it ? I don't know
the man, if he were a prince, that might not be proud
of Anne.'

All this Heathcote listened to with very strange
sensations. He was angry, amused, touched by the
enthusiasm of the little round shining man, who thus
entreated him, with every kind of eloquence he was
capable of, his eyes and hands and his whole frame
twisting into gestures of persuasion. Heathcote was
disposed to laugh, but he was still more disposed
to resent this familiar employment of his cousin's
name.

Are you aware that I have no right to be
brought into the family secrets, to have their affairs
thus revealed to me ? ' he said. ' Stop  nor to hear
the name of a young lady for whom I have so much
respect treated so. Allowing that I need not resent
it as a liberty, since you are an older friend than I
am, still you must see that between you and me,
strangers to each other '

Yes, yes, I see,' said Mr. Loseby, ' you are quite
right. I see. I thought perhaps exceptional circumstances
might warrant  but never mind. I am
wrong ; I see it. Well, then, about this entail business.
Don't you see this is why our friend does not
jump at it ? Little Eose could never be Montfort
of Mount. Anne would make a noble squire, but it
is out of the question for her sister. Keep to your
entail, Mr. Heathcote, and if I can be of use to you,
I will do my best. If it's a money difficulty we'll
tide it over for you. Let me know all the circumstances,
and I will do my best.'

I cannot give up my project all at once,' Heath-cote
said, hesitating.

I would if I were you. It would harm yourself
and do good to nobody. I certainly would if I were
you,' said the lawyer, getting up and accompanying
him to the door.

I must exercise my own j judgment on that point,
Mr. Loseby.'

Certainly, certainly, certainly, sir. Heathcote
Montfort! You will all exercise your judgment,
you will all do what seems good in your own eyes.
I know what the Mountfords are from generation to
generation. If it had not been that St. John Mount -
ford had the luck to take a fancy to a rich woman
for his first wife, what would the place have been
by this time? But that is a chance that doesn't
happen once in a century. And now, when here is
another  the finest chance ! with openings for such
a settlement I But never mind ; never mind ; of
course you will all take your own way.'

I hope you have brought him to reason, Loseby,'
said Mr. Montfort, from the back of his cob, as
they emerged again into the street.

All arrangements about property which are

against nature are against reason,' said the little
lawyer, sententiously. ' Grood afternoon, gentlemen.
When you go in for these fancy arrangements, it is
some sort of a poetical personage you want, and nota
lawyer. I wish you a pleasant ride.'

He is a character,' said Mr. Montfort, with a

short laugh, as they rode away. But that laugh was

the only sound of the lighter sort that broke the

gravity of their silent companionship, as their

horses' hoofs clattered over the stones of the little

town, and came out upon the long silence of the

country road now falling rapidly into twilight.

We are a little late,' Mr. Montfort said, half-an-hour

after. As for Heathcote, he did not feel, anymore

than his kinsman, in a humour for talk.

What he had heard, though he had protested against

hearing it, dwelt in his mind, and the somewhat

morose gravity of the other infected him in spite of

himself. What had St. John Montfort, who was

in reality a commonplace, good enough sort of man,

been doing to warrant so gloomy an aspect ? Had

he been turning the fortunes of the family upside

down and spoiling the life of the daughter he loved
best r or was it a mere exhibition of sulkiness consequent
upon the quarrel with the lawyer and the
opposition he had encountered? Heathcote had
known nothing about these Mountfords a week ago,
and now how closely he felt himself knitted up in
their affairs, whether he continued to be finally
connected with them or not ! As he rode along
in silence by his kinsman's side, he could not
help thinking of the catastrophe which might becoming
; that ' fine creature ' Anne  the little old
bald shining lawyer had grown eloquent when he
spoke of her. And though she seemed a little severe
to Heathcote, he could not but acknowledge to himself
that she had always interested him. Rose ? oh,
Rose was a pretty little thing, a child, a nobody ; it
did not matter very much what happened to her ;
but if it should happen that Anne's life was being
changed, the brightness taken out of it, and all those
advantages which seem so natural and becoming
transferred from her to the profit of Rose? Heath-cote
felt that this would be a wrong to move heaven

and earth ; but it was not a subject in which he, a
stranger, had any right to interfere. As he looked
at the dark muffled figure of her father by his side
against the faint crimson which still lingered in the
west, he could scarcely help chafing at the thought
that, though he was their nearest relation, he was
still a stranger, and must not, dared not say a word-and
what kind of fellow, he said to himself, in
natural indignation, could it be who was wilfully
leading Anne into the wilderness, accepting her
sacrifice of that which was the very foundation of
her life ? Perhaps had he himself been the man
who loved Anne he would have seen things in a
different light ; but from his present point of view
his mind was full of angry wrath and contempt for
the unknown who could let a girl inexperienced in
the world give up so much for him. He was a
nobody, they said. He must be a poor sort of
creature, Heathcote, on these very insufficient
grounds, decided in his heart.

It was a beautiful clear October night, with frost
in the air, the stars shining every minute more and

more brightly, the. crimson disappearing, even the
last golden afterglow fading into palest yellow in
the west, and all the great vault of sky darkening to
perfect night. The horses' hoofs beat upon the long,
safe, well-kept road, bordered by long monotonous
walls and clouds of trees, from which darkness had
stolen their colour  a perfectly safe, tranquil country
road, with a peaceful house at the end, already lighting
all its windows, preparing its table for the wayfarers.
Yet there was something of the gloom of a
tragedy in the dark figure wrapped in silence,
pondering one could not tell what plans of mischief,
and wrathful gloomy intentions, which rode by
Heathcote's side, without a word, along all those
miles of darkling way.

CHAPTEK XVI.

GOOD ADVICE.

The dinner to which the family sat down after this
ride somewhat alarmed the stranger-relative who so
suddenly found himself mixed up in their affairs. He
thought it must necessarily be a constrained and uncomfortable
meal. But this did not turn out to be the
case. Anne knew nothing at all about what her father
had been doing, and from Eose's light nature the half
comprehended scene at luncheon, when her mother
had wept and her father's face had been like a
thundercloud, had already faded away. These two
unconscious members of the party kept the tide of
affairs in flow. They talked as usual  Anne even
more than usual, as one who is unaware of the critical
point at which, to the knowledge of all around, he or
she is standing, so often does. She gave even a little

more information than was called for about her visit
to the Woodheads, being in her own mind half
ashamed of her cowardice in staying away after the
scene of the morning. On the whole she was glad,
she persuaded herself, of the scene of the morning. It
had placed her position beyond doubt. There had
seemed no occasion to make any statement to her
father as to the correspondence which he had not
forbidden or indeed referred to. He had bidden her
give up her lover, and she had refused ; but he had
said nothing about the lover's letters, though these
followed as a matter of course. And now it was well
that he should know the exact position of affairs. She
had been gi-early agitated at the moment, but soon
composed herself. And in her desire to show that
she was satisfied, not grieved by what had happened
Anne was more than usually cheerful and communicative
in her talk.

Fanny is very happy about her brother who is
coming home from India. He is to be here only six
weeks ; but he does not grudge the long journey :
and they are all so happy.'

He is a fool for his pains,' growled Mr. Mount-ford
from the head of the table. ' I don't know what
our young men men are coming to. What right has
he to such a luxury ? It will cost him a hundred
pounds at the least. Six weeks  he has not been
gone as many years.'

'Four years  that is a long time when people
are fond of each other,' said Anne, with a scarcely
perceptible smile. Every individual at table instantly
thought of the absent lover.

She is thinking that I will be dead and gone in
four years, and she will be free,' the angry father said
to himself, with a vindictive sense that he was justified
in the punishment he meant to inflict upon her.
But Anne, indeed, was thinking of nothing of the
kind, only with a visionary regret that in her own
family there was no one to come eager over sea and
land to be longed and prayed for with Fanny Wood-head's
anxious sisterly motherly passion. This was
far, very far from the imagination of the others as a
motive likely to produce such a sigh.

A brother from India is always anxiously looked

for,' said Mrs. Montfort, stepping in with that half-compunctious
readiness to succour Anne which the
knowledge of this day's proceedings had produced in
her. She did not, in fact, know what these proceedings
had been,. and they were in no way her fault.
But still she felt a compunction. 'They always
bring such quantities of things with them,' she added.
An Indian box is the most delightful thing to open.
I had a brother in India, too '

I wish we had,' said Eose, with a pout. Heath-cote
had been preoccupied : he had not been so
attentive ' as usual : and she wished for a brother
instantly, ' just to spite him,' she said to herself.

Fanny is not thinking of the presents ; but
Eose, consider you are interested in it, too  that is
another man for your dance.'

Eose clapped her hands.  We are looking up,' she
said. ' Twenty men from Sandhurst, and six from
Meadowlands, and Lady Prayer Poule's husband,
and Fred Woodhead and Willie Ashley  for of
course Willie is coming '

A dance at this time of the year is folly,' said

Mr. Montfort ; ' even in summer it is bad enough y
but the only time of the year for entertainments in
the country is when you have warm weather and
short nights.'

'It was because of Cousin Heathcote, papa. It
is not often we have a man, a real relation, staying
at Mount.'

Heathcote ! oh, so it is for your sake, Heathcote ?
I did not know that dancing was an attribute of
reasonable beings after thirty Mr. Montfort said.

Then it was Anne who came to Heathcote's aid,
You are not afraid of seeming frivolous ? ' she said,
giving him the kindest look he had yet seen in her
eyes ; and his heart was touched by it : he had not
known that Anne's eyes had been so fine  ' and it will
please everybody. The county requires to be stirred
up now and then. We like to have something to
talk about, to say, " Are you going to the So-and-so's
on the 25th ? " '

An admirable reason certainly for trouble and
expense. If you were electioneering, it might be
reasonable ; but I presume your woman's rights are

not so advanced yet as that. bliss Anne Montfort
can't stand for the county ! '

I don't think she is likely to try, father,' said
Anne, ' whatever might be the rights  or wrongs.'

You must not think, Mr. Heathcote,' said Mrs.
Montfort anxiously, 'that Anne has anything to
say to women's rights.' She is far too sensible.
She has her own ways of thinking, but she is
neither absurd nor strong-minded '

I hope you do not think me weak-minded,
mamma,' Anne said, with a soft laugh.

And then little more was said. ]mr. Montfort
half rose and mumbled that grace after meat which
leaves out all the more ethereal part of the repast
as, we suppose, a kind of uncovenanted mercies for
which no thanks are to be uttered ; and after a while
the ladies left the room. It was cold, but the
whole frosty world outside lay enchanted under the
whitening of the moon. The girls caught up fur
cloaks and shawls as they went through the hall, and
stepped outside involuntarily. The sky was intensely
blue ; the clouds piled high in snowy masses, the

VOL. II. E

moon sailing serenely across the great expanse,
veiling herself lightly here and there with a film of
vapour which the wind had detached from the cloud-mountains.
These filmy fragments were floating
across the sky at extraordinary speed, and the wind
was rising, whirling down showers of leaves. The
commotion among the trees, the sound of the wind,
the rapid flight of the clouds, all chimed in with
Anne's mood. She took hold of her sister's arm
with gentle force. ' Stay a little, Eose  it is all
quiet inside, and here there is so much going on : it
is louder than one's thoughts,' Anne said.

What do you mean by being louder than your
thoughts? Your thoughts are not loud at all  not
mine at least : and I don't like those dead leaves all
blowing into my face ; they feel like things touching
you. I think I shall go in, Anne.'

'Not yet, dear. I like it: it occupies one in
spite of one's self. The lawn will be all yellow tomorrow
with scattered gold.'

You mean with scattered leaves ; of course it
will,' said Rose. ' When the wind is high like this

it brings the leaves down like anything. The lime
trees will be stripped, and it is a pity, for they were
pretty. Everything is pretty this year. Papa has
been to Hunston,' she said, abruptly, looking Anne
in the face ; but it was very difficult even for
Eose's keen little eyes to distinguish in the moonlight
whether or not Anne knew.

Anne took very little notice of this bit of news.
So Saymore told me. Did mr. Heathcote see the
church, I wonder ? I hope some one told him how
fine it was, and that there were some Montfort
monuments.'

Do you know what papa was doing in Hunston ,
Anne ? He went to see ]Mr. Loseby. ]\Iamma
made quite a fuss when he went away. She would
not tell me what it was. Perhaps she did not know
herself. She often gets into quite a state about
things she doesn't know. Can you tell me what
papa could want with Mr. Loseby ? you can see for
yourself how cross he is now he has come back.'

With Mr. Loseby ? no, I cannot tell you, Rose.'
Anne heard the news with a little thrill of excite

Universe? or jm im

ment. It was rarely that Mr. Montfort went sofar
; very rarely that he did anything which, through
his wife, or Saymore, or Eose herself, did not find
its way to the knowledge of the entire household.
Anne connected the incident of the morning with
this recent expedition, and her heart beat faster in
her breast. Well : she was prepared ; she had
counted the cost. If she was to be disinherited, that
could be borne  but not to be untrue.

That means you will not tell me, Anne. I
wonder why I should always be the last to know.
For all anyone can tell, it may just be of as much
consequence to me as to you, if he went to tamper
with his will, as mamma said. What do you call
tampering with a will? I don't see,' cried Eose,
indignantly, 'why I should always be supposed
too young to know. Most likely it is of just as
much consequence to me as to you.'

Eose,' cried her mother, from the window,
came in  come in at once ! How can you keep
that child out in the cold, Anne, when you know
what a delicate throat she has ? ' Then Mrs.

Montfort gave an audible shiver and shut down the
window hastily ; for it was very cold.

I have nothing to tell you, dear,' Anne said
gently. ' But you are quite right ; if there is any
change made, it will be quite as important to you
as to me : only you must not ask me about it, for
my father does not take me into his confidence, and
I don't know.'

You don't want to tell me ! ' said the girl ; but
this time sirs. Montfort knocked loudly on the
window, and Eose was not sufficiently emancipated
to neglect the second summons. x\nne walked with
her sister to the door, but then came back again to
the sheltered walk under the windows. It was a
melancholy hour when one was alone. The yellow
leaves came down in showers flying on the wind.
The clouds pursued each other over the sky. The
great masses of vapours behind the wind began to
invade the frosty blue ; yet still the moon held on
serenely, though her light was more and more
interrupted by sudden blanks of shadow. Anne had
no inclination to go into the quiet of the drawing-room,

the needlework, and Mrs. Montfort's little
lectures, and perhaps the half-heard chattering with
which Eose amused and held possession of her cousin.
To her, whose happier life was hidden in the distance,
it was more congenial to stay out here, among the
flying winds and falling leases. If it was so that
Fortune was forsaking her ; if her father had carried
out his threat, and she was now penniless, with
nothing but herself to take to Cosmo, what change
would this make in her future life ? Would he mind ?
What would he say ? Anne had no personal experience
at all, though she was so serious and so deeply
learned in the troubles at least of village life. As
she asked herself these questions, a smile crept about
her lips in spite of her. She did not mean to smile.
She meant to enquire very gravely : would he mind ?
what would he say ? but the smile came without
her knowledge. What could he say but one
thing ? If it had been another man, there might
have been doubts and hesitations  but Cosmo !
The mile stole to the corners of her mouth 
a melting softness came into her heart. How

little need was there to question I Did not she
know?

Her thoughts were so full of this that she did
not hear another foot on the gravel, and when
Heathcote spoke she awakened with a start, and
came down out of that lofty hermitage of her
thoughts with little satisfaction ; but when he said
something of the beauty of the night and the fascination
of all those voices of the wind and woods,
Anne, whether willingly or not, felt herself compelled
to be civil. She came down from her
abstraction, admitting, politely, that the night was
fine. ' But,' she said, ' it is very cold, and the
wind is rising every moment ; I was thinking of
going in.'

I wonder if you would wait for a few minutes,
Miss Montfort, and hear something I have to say.'

Certainly,' Anne said ; but she was surprised ;
and now that it was no longer her own will which
kept her here, the wind all at once became very
Boisterous, and the ' silver lights and darks ' dreary.
Do you know we have a ghost belonging to us ? '

she said. ' She haunts that lime avenue. We
ought to see her to-night.'

We have so little time for ghosts,' said Heath-cote,
almost fretfully ; and then he added, ' Miss
Montfort, I came to Mount on a special mission.
Will you let me tell you what it was ? I came to
offer your father my co-operation in breaking the
entail.

Breaking the entail ! ' the idea was so surprising-that
all who heard it received it with the same
exclamation. As for Anne, she did more : she cast
one rapid involuntary glance around her upon the
house with all its lights, the familiar garden, the
waving clouds of trees. In her heart she felt as if a
sharp arrow of possible delight, despair, she knew
not which, struck her keenly to the core. It was
only for a moment. Then she drew a long breath
and said, ' You bewilder me altogether ; break the
entail  why should you ? I cannot comprehend it.
Pardon me, it is as if the Prince of Wales said he
would not have the crown. Mount is England to us
Mountfords. I cannot understand what you mean.'

Heathcote thought he understood very well what
she meant. He understood her look. Everything
round was dear to her. Her first thought had been
Mount I to be ours still, ours always I But what
did ours mean ? Did she think of herself as heiress
and mistress, or of  someone else ? This pricked
him at the heart, as she had been pricked by a
different sentiment, by the thought that she had no
longer the first interest in this piece of news ; but
there was no reason whatever for keen feeling in
his case. What did it matter to him who had it ?
He did not want it. He clear-ed his throat to get
rid of that involuntary impatience and annoyance.
It is not very difficult to understand,' he said.
Mount is not to me what it is to you ; I have
only been here once before. My interests are elsewhere.'


Anne bowed gravely. They did not know each
other well enough to permit of more confidential
disclose-es. She did not feel sufficient interest to
ask, he thought ; and she had no right to pry into
his private concerns, Anne said to herself. Then

there was a pause : which she broke quite unexpectedly
with one of those impulses which were so
unlike Anne's external aspect, and yet so entirely in
harmony with herself.

This makes my heart beat she said, ' the idea
that Mount might be altogether ours  our home in
the future as well as in the past ; but at the same
time, forgive me, it gives me a little pain to think
that there is a Montfort, and he the heir, who
thinks so little of Mount. It seems a slight to the
place. I grudge that you should give it up, though
it is delightful to think that we may have it;
which is absurd, of course  like so many other
things.'

Do you know,' he said,  there is a great deal of
the same sort of feeling in my own mind. I can't
care for Mount, can I ? I have not seen it for
fifteen years ; I was a boy then ; now I am middle-aged,
and don't care much for anything. But yet I
too grudge that I should care for it so little ; that I
should be so willing to part with it. The feeling is
absurd, as you say. If you could have it. Miss

Montfort, I should surmount that feeling easily : I
should rejoice in the substitution '

And why should not I have it ? ' cried Anne
quickly, turning upon him. Then she paused and
laughed, though with constraint, and begged his
pardon. ' I don't quite know what you mean,' she
said, ' or what you know.'

Miss Montfort, having said so much to you,
may I say a little more ? I am one of your nearest
relatives, and I am a great deal older than you are.
There is some question which divides you from your
father. I do not ask nor pretend to divine what it
is. You are not agreed  and for this reason he
thinks little of my proposal, and does not care to
secure the reversion of his own property, the house
which, in other circumstances, he would have desired
to leave in your possession. I think, so far as I have
gone, this is the state of the case ? '

Well I ' She neither contradicted him nor
consented to what he had said, but stood in the fitful
moonlight, blown about by the wind, holding her

cloak closely round her, and looking at him between
the light and gloom.

Pardon me,' he said, ' I have no right whatever
to interfere : but  if you could bend your will to his
if you could humour him as long as his life lasts :
your father is becoming an old man. Miss Mount-ford,
you would not need perhaps to make this sacrifice
for very long.'

She elapsed her hands with impatient alarm,
stopping him abruptly  ' Is my father ill ? Is there
anything you know of that we do not know ? '

Nothing whatever. I only know his age, no
more. Could you not yield to him, subdue your will
to his ? You are young, and you have plenty of
time to wait. Believe me, the happiness that will
not bear to be waited for is scarcely worth having.
I have no right to say a word  I do not understand
the circumstances  actually I k7iow nothing about
them. But if you could yield to him, humour him
for a time '

Pretend to obey him while he lived,' Anne said,
in a low voice, ' in order that I may be able to cheat

him when he is gone : that is a strange thing to
recommend to me.'

There is no question of cheating him. What I
mean is, that if you would submit to him ; give him
the pleasure of feeling himself obeyed in the end of
his life '

I owe my father obedience at all times ; but
there are surely distinctions. Will you tell me why
you say this to me ? '

I cannot tell you why : only that there is something
going on which will tell against you : sincerely,
I do not know what it is. I do not want to counsel
you to anything false, and I scarcely know what I am
advising you to do. It is only, enlist Montfort, while
you can  if you can  to submit to him : or even, if
no better can be, seem to submit to him. Submit to
him while he lives. This may be a caprice on his part
no more : but at the same time it may affect your
whole life.'

Anne stood for a moment irresolute, not knowing
what to say. The night favoured her and the
dark. She could speak with less embarrassment

than if the daylight had been betraying her every
look and change of aspect. ' Mr. Heathcote, I
thank you for taking so much interest in me,' she
said.

I take the greatest interest in you. Miss Mount-ford
; but in the meantime I would say the same
to anyone so young. Things are going on which
will injure you for your life. If you can by your
submission avert these ills, and make him happier 
even for a time ? '

In short,' she said again, ' pretend to give up
until he is no longer here to see whether I follow
my own inclinations or his? It may be wise
advice, Mr. Heathcote; but is it advice which
you would like your  anyone you cared for  to
take?'

I should not like anyone I cared for,' he said
hesitating  'Pardon me, I cannot help offending
you  to be in opposition to her family on such a
point.'

The colour rushed to Anne's face, and anger to
her heart : but as the one was invisible, so she restrained

the other. She put restraint in every way
on herself.

That may be so, that may be so ! you cannot
tell unless you know everything,' she said. Then,
after a pause, ' But whether it was right or wrong,
it is done now, and I cannot alter it. It is not a
matter upon which another can decide for you.
Obedience at my age cannot be absolute. When
you have to make the one choice of your life, can
your father do it, or anyone but yourself ? Did you
think so when you were like me ? ' she said, with an
appeal full of earnestness which was almost impassioned.
This appeal took Heathcote entirely by
surprise, and changed all the current of his thoughts.

I was never like you,' he said, hastily  ' like
you ! I never could compare myself  I never could
pretend  I thought I loved half-a-dozen women.
Did I ever make the one choice of my life ? No,
no ! A wandering man afloat upon the world can
never be like  such as you: there is too great a
difference. We cannot compare things so unlike *

But I thought ' she said, then stopped : for

his story which she had heard bore a very different
meaning. And what right had she to advert to it ?
I don't know if yon speak in  in respect  or in
contempt ? '

In contempt  could that be ? Here is the
state of the case as concerns yourself  leaving the
general question. My offer to break the entail has
no attractions for your father, because he thinks he
cannot secure Mount to you. It is doing something
against his own heart, against all he wishes,
to punish you. Don't you know. Miss Montfort 
but most likely you never felt it  that

to be wroth with those we love
Doth work like madness in the brain ? '

Love ?  that would be great love, passionate
love  we have not anything of the kind in our
house,' said Anne, in a low tone of emotion. ' If
there was that, do you think I would go against it,
even for '

Here she stopped with a thrill in her voice,
I think you must be mistaken a little, Mr. Heath-cote.
But I do not see how I can change. Papa

asked of me  not the lesser things in which I could
have obeyed him, but the one great thing in which I
could not. Were I to take your advice, I do not
know what I could do.'

Then they walked in silence round the side of
the house, under the long line of the drawing-room
windows, from which indeed the interview had been
watched with much astonishment. Rose had never
doubted that the heir of the house was on her side.
It seemed no better than a desertion that he should
walk and talk with Anne in this way. It filled her
with amazement. And in such a cold night too !
Hush, child I ' her mother was saying ; ' he has
been with papa to Hunston, he has heard all the
business arrangements talked over. No doubt he is
having a little conversation with Anne, for her good.'

What are the business arrangements ? What is
going to happen ? ' Is he trying to make her give up
Mr. Douglas ? ' said Rose ; but her mother could
not or would not give her any information. By-and-by
Heathcote came in alone. Anne was too much
disturbed by this strange interview to appear when it

VOL. II. F

was over in the tranquil circle of the family. She
went upstairs to take off her wraps, to subdue the
commotion in her mind and the light in her eyes
and tame herself down to the every-day level. Her
mind was somewhat confused, more confused than it
had yet been as to her duty. Cosmo somehow had
seemed to be gently pushed out of the first place by
this stranger who never named him, who knew
nothing of him, and who certainly ignored the
fact that, without Cosmo, Anne no longer lived or
breathed. She was angry that he should be so
ignorant, yet too shy and proud to mention her
lover or refer to him save by implication. She would
have been willing to give up corresponding with him,
to make any immediate sacrifice to her father's
prejudice against him had that been ever asked of
her. But to give up ' the one choice of her life,' as
she had said, would have been impossible. Her mind
was affected strongly, but not with alarm, by the
intelligence that something was being done mysteriously
in the dark against her, that the threat under
which she had been living was now being carried

out. But this did not move her to submit as
Heathcote had urged  rather it stimulated her to
resist.

Had Cosmo but been at hand I But if he had
been at hand, how could he have ventured to give
the advice which Heathcote gave ? He could not
have asked her to yield, to dissemble, to please the
old man while his life lasted, to pretend to give himself
up. Nothing of this could he have suggested or
she listened to. And yet it was what Cosmo would
have liked to advise ; but to this state of Cosmo's
mind Anne had no clue.

CHAPTER XVII.

THE ABSOLUTE AND THE COMPARATIVE.

This secret incident in the family history left a
great deal of agitation in the house. Mrs. Mount-ford
had not been informed in any detail what her
husband's mission to Hunston was. She knew that
he had gone to * tamper with his will,' as she said,
but what were the exact changes he meant to make
in that will she did not know. They were certainly
to the advantage of Eose and to the detriment of
Anne : so much she was aware of, but scarcely anything
more. And she herself was frightened and
excited, afraid of all the odium to which she would
infallibly be exposed if the positions of the sisters
were changed, and more or less affected by a shrinking
from palpable injustice ; but yet very much excited
about Eose's possible good fortune, and not feeling

it possible to banish hopes and imaginations on this
point out of her mind. If Rose was put in the first
place it would not be just  not exactly just, she said
to herself, with involuntary softening of the expression.
Rose's mother (though she would be blamed)
knew that of herself she never would have done anything
to deprive Anne of her birthright. But still,
if papa thought Anne had behaved badly, and that
Rose deserved more at his hands, he was far better
no doubt far better, able to judge than she was ;
and who could say a word against his decision ? But
it was very irritating, very wearing, not to know.
She tried a great many ways of finding out, but she
did not succeed. Vir. Montfort was on his guard,
and kept his own counsel. He told her of Heathcote'a
proposal, but he did not tell her what he himself
meant to do. And how it was that her husband was
so indifferent to Heathcote's proposal Mrs. Montfort
could not understand. She herself, though not a
Montfort born, felt her heart beat at the suggestion.
Of course you will jump at it ? ' she said.

I do not feel in the least disposed to jump at it.

If there had been a boy, it might have been different.
Mrs. Montfort always felt that in this there was an
inferred censure upon herself  how unjust a censure
it is unnecessary to say : of course she would have
had a boy if she could  of that there could be no
question.

A boy is not everything,' she said. ' It would
be just the same thing if Anne's husband took the
name.

Don't speak to me of Anne's husband,' he cried,
almost with passion. ' I forbid you to say a word tome
of Anne's affairs.'

St. John ! what can you mean ? It would be
barbarous of me, it would be unchristian,' cried
the much-exercised mother, trying hard to do her
duty, ' not to speak of Anne's affairs. Probably the
man you object to will never be her husband ;
probably '

That is enough, Letitia. I want to hear nothing
more upon the subject. Talk of anything else you
like, but I will have nothing said about Anne.'

Then you are doing wrong,' she cried, with a

little real indignation. After this her tone changed
in a moment : something like bitterness stole into
it. ' It shows how much more you are thinking of
Anne than of anyone else. You are rejecting Mount
because you don't choose that she should be the heir.
You forget you have got another child.'

Forget I have got another child I It is the first
subject of my thoughts.'

Ah, yes, perhaps so far as the money is concerned.
Of course if Amie does not have it, there is
nobody but Eose who could have any right to it.
But you don't think your youngest daughter good
enough to have anything to do with Mount. I see very
well how it is, though you don't choose to explain.'

If that is how you prefer to look at it,' he said ;
but at this moment a budget of papers arrived from
Hunston by a special messenger, and Mrs. Montfort
withdrew perforce. She was in a very irritable condition,
as all the house knew, ready to find fault with
everything. Perhaps it was rather an advantage to
her to have a grievance, and to be able to reproach
her husband with preferring in his heart the elder to

the younger, even when he was preferring the
younger to the elder in this new will. ' There will
never be any question of my child's husband taking
the name, that is very clear,' she said to herself, with
much vehemence, nursing her wrath to keep it warm,
and thus escaping from the question of injustice to
Anne. And again it occurred to her, but with more
force than before, that to announce to her husband
that Rose was going to marry Heathcote Montfort
would be a delightful triumph. She would thus be
Mrs. Montfort of Mount in spite of him, and the
victory would be sweet. But even this did not seem
to progress as it appeared to do at first. Heathcote,
too, seemed to be becoming interested in Anne :
as if that could advantage him! when it was
clear that Anne was ready to lose everything, and
was risking everything, every day, for that other !
Altogether Mrs. Montfort's position was not a
comfortable one. To know so much and yet to
know so little was very hard to bear.

Her husband had a still harder life as being a
free agent, and having the whole weight of the

decision upon his shoulders. It was not to be supposed
that he could free himself entirely from ail
sense of guilt towards the child whom in his heart
he loved most. He had resolved to punish her, and
he clung to his resolution with all the determination
of a narrow mind. He had said that she should
never marry the man who was nobody, that if she
held by him he would give her fortune to Eose.
And she did hold by him, with an obstinacy equal
to his own. Was it possible that he should bear this
and give her reason to laugh at his words as mere
sound and fury signifying nothing ? No, whatever
he might have to suffer for it, no ? Perhaps,
however, the great secret of Mr. Montfort's obstinate
adherence to a determination which he could
not but know to be unjust and cruel  and of many
more of the cruelties and eccentricities that people
perpetrate by their wills  lay in the fact that, after
all, though he took so much trouble to make his
will, he had not the slightest intention of dying L
If a man does not die, a monstrous will is no more
than an angry letter  a thing which wounds and

vexes, perhaps, and certainly is intended to wound
and vex, and which suffices to blow off a great deal
of the steam of family quarrels : but which does no
real harm to anybody, in that there is plenty of time
to change it, and to make all right again some time
or other. Another thing which assisted him in
getting over his own doubts and disquietudes was the
strenuous, almost violent, opposition of Mr. Loseby,
who did not indeed refuse at last to carry out his
wishes, but did so with so many protests and remonstrances
that Mr. Montfort's spirit was roused, and
he forgot the questionings of his own conscience in
the determination to defend himself against those of
this other man who had, he declared to himself,
nothing whatever to do with it, and no right to
interfere. Could not a man do what he would with
his own ? The money was his own, the land his own,
and his children too were his own. Who else had anything
to do with the arrangements he chose to make
for them ? It was of his grace and favour if he gave
them his money at all. He was not bound to do so.
It was all his ; he was not responsible to any mortal ;

it was a pretty piece of impudence that Loseby
should venture to take so much upon him. This
opposition of Loseby's did him all the good in the
world. It set him right with himself. But still
those packets of papers, always accompanied by
a letter, were annoying to him. ' I send you the
draft of the new codicil, but you must allow me to

observe ' ' I return draft with the corrections

you have made, but I must once more entreat you to

pause and reconsider ' What did the old fellow

mean? Did he think he had any right to speak  a
country attorney, a mere man of business ? To be
sure he was an old friend  nobody said he was not
an old friend ; but the oldest friend in the world
should know his own place, and should not presume
too far. If Loseby thought that now, when matters
had gone this length, his representations would have
any effect, he was indeed making a mistake. Before
pen had been put to paper Mr. Montfort might
perhaps have reconsidered the matter ; but now, and
in apparent deference to Loseby ! this was a complaisance
which was impossible.

The whole house was agitated by these proceedings,
though publicly not a word was said nor an.
allusion made to them. Anne even, absolutely disinterested
as she was, and full of a fine, but alas I
quite unreasonable contempt for fortune  the contempt
of one who had no understanding of the want
of it  felt it affect her in, as she thought, the most
extraordinary and unworthy way. She was astonished
at herself. After all, she reflected, with a sense of
humiliation, how much power must those external
circumstances have on the mind, when she, whose
principles and sentiments were all so opposed to
their influence, could be thus moved by the possible
loss of a little land or a little money ! It was-pitiful
: but she could not help it, and she felt
herself humbled to the very dust. In the fulness of
her heart she wrote an account of all that was-happening
to Cosmo, reproaching herself, yet trying
to account for her weakness. ' It cannot be the
mere loss of the wealth that affects me,' Anne wrote.
'I cannot believe so badly of myself, and I hope  I
hope  you will not think so badly of me. It must.

"be (don't you think ?) the pain of feeling that my

father thinks so little of me as to put upon me this

public mark of his displeasure. I say to myself,

dear Cosmo, that this must be the cause of the very

unquestionable pain I feel ; and I hope you will

think so too, and not that it is the actual money I

care for. And, then, there is the humiliation of

being put second  I who have always been first. I

never thought there was so much in seniority, in all

those little superiorities which I suppose we plume

ourselves upon without knowing it. I can't bear the

idea of being second, I suppose. And then there is

the uncertainty, the sense of something that is going

on, in which one is so closely concerned, but which

one does not know, and the feeling that others are

better informed, and that one is being talked of, and

the question discussed how one will bear it. As if it

mattered ! but I acknowledge with humiliation that

it does matter, that I care a great deal more than I

ever thought I cared  that I am a much poorer

creature than I believed I was. I scorn myself, but

I hope my Cosmo will not scorn me. You know the

world better, and the heart which is pettier than one
likes to think. Perhaps it is women only that are
the victims of these unworthy sentiments. I cannot
think of you as being moved by them ; perhaps what
is said of us is true, and we are only " like moonlight
unto sunlight, and like water into wine." But these
are far too pretty comparisons if I am right.
However, heaven be praised, there is the happiness
of feeling that, if I am but after all a mean and
interested creature, there is you to fall back upon,
who are so different. Cosmo mio, what would the
world be now if I had not you to fall back upon (I
like these words !), and lean against and feel myself
doubled, or so much more than doubled, and propped
up by you. I feel already a little better for getting
this off my mind and telling you what I have found
out in myself, and how ashamed I am by my
discoveries. You have " larger, other eyes " than
mine, and you will understand me, and excuse me
and put me right.'

Cosmo Douglas received this letter in his
chambers, to which he had now gone back. He

read it with a sort of consternation. First, the news
it conveyed was terrible, making an end of all his
hopes ; and second, this most ill-timed and unnecessary
self-accusation was more than his commonsense
could put up with. It was not that the
glamour of love was wearing off, for he still loved
Anne truly ; but that anyone in her senses could
write so about money was inconceivable to him.
Could there be a more serious predicament ? and yet
here was she apologising to him for feeling it,
making believe that he would not feel it. Is she a
fool ? he said to himself  he was exasperated, though
he loved her. And in his reply he could not but in
some degree betray this feeling.

My dearest,' he said, ' I don't understand how
you can blame yourself. The feelings you express
are most natural. It is very serious, very painful 
infinitely painful to me, that it is my love and the
tie which binds us which has brought this upon you.
A\Tiat am I to say to my dear love ? Grive me up,
throw me over ? I will bear anything rather than
that you should suffer; but I know your generous

heart too well to imagine that you will do this. If
you were "petty," as you call yourself (heaven
forgive you for such blasphemy !) I could almost be
tempted to advise you to have recourse to  what
shall I call it ?  strategy  one of the fictions that
are said to be all fair in love and war. I could do
this myself, I am afraid, so little is there in me of
the higher sentiment you give me credit for.
Rather than that you should lose your birthright, if
it were only my happiness that was concerned, I
would take myself out of the way, I would give up
the sweet intercourse which is life to me, and hope
for better days to come. And if you should decide
to do this, I will accept whatever you decide, my
darling, with full trust in you that you will not
forget me, that the sun may shine for me again.
Will you do this, my Anne ? Obey your father, and
let me take my chance : it will be better that than
to be the cause of so much suffering to you. But
even in saying this T feel that I will wound your
tender heart, your fine sense of honour : what can I
say ? Sacrifice me, my dearest, if you can steel

yoiir heart to the possibility of being unkind. I
would be a poor wretch, indeed, unworthy the
honour you have done me, if I could not trust you
and bide my time,'

This letter was very carefully composed and
with much thought. If Anne could but have been
made a convert to the code that all is fair in love,
what a reef it would have been ; or if she could
have divined the embarrassment that a portionless
bride, however much he loved her, would be to
Cosmo ! But, on the other hand, there was no
certainty that, even if the worst came to the worst,
she would be a portionless bride ; and the chances of
alarming her, and bringing about a revulsion of
feeling, were almost more dreadful than the chances
of losing her fortune. It wanted very delicate steering
to hit exactly the right passage between these
dangers, and Cosmo was far from confident that he
had hit it. A man with a practical mind and a
real knowledge of the world has a great deal to go
through when he has to deal with the absolute in the
person of a young inexperienced and high-flown girl,

VOL. II, Gt

altogether ignorant of the world. And, as a matter
of fact, the letter did not please Anne. It gave her
that uneasy sense of coming in contact with new
agencies, powers unknown, not to be judged by her
previous canons, which is one of the first disenchantments
of life. How to lie and yet not be guilty of
lying was a new science to her. She did not understand
that casuistry of love, which makes it a light
offence to deceive. She understood the art of taking
her own way, but that of giving up her own way, and
yet resolving to have it all the same, was beyond
her power. What they wanted her to do was to
deceive her father, to wait  surely the most terrible
of all meanness  till he should be dead and then
break her promise to him. This was what Heathcote
had advised, and now Cosmo  Cosmo himself replied
to her ,when she threw herself upon him for support,
in the same sense. A chill of disappointment,
discouragement, came over her. If this was the
best thing to be done, it seemed to Anne that her
own folly was better than their wisdom. Had she
been told that love and a stout heart and two against

the world were better than lands or wealth, she
would have felt herself strong enough for any heroism.
But this dash of cold water in her face confounded
her. WTiat did they mean by telling her to obey
her father? he had not asked for obedience. He
had said, ' If you do not give up this man, I will
take yom fortune from you,' and she had proudly
accepted the alternative. That was all ; and was
she to go back to him now, to tell him a lie, and
with a mental reservation say, ' I peter my fortune ;
I have changed my mind ; I will give him up ? '
Anne knew that she could not have survived the
utter scorn of herself which would have been her
portion had she done this. Were it necessary to doit,
the proud girl would have waited till the other
sacrifice was completed, till her father had fulfilled
his threat. Cosmo's letter gave her a chill in the
very warmth of her imbibed faith in him. She
would not allow to herself that he did not understand
her, that he had failed of what she expected
from him. This was honour, no doubt, from
his point of view ; but she felt a chill sense of lone
2

lines, a loss of that power of falling back upon an
unfailing support which she had so fondly and
proudly insisted on. She was subdued in her courage
and pride and confidence. And yet this was not all
that Anne had to go through.

It was Mr. Loseby who was the next operator
upon her disturbed and awakening thoughts. One
wintry afternoon when November had begun, he
drove over to Mount in his little phaeton with a
blue bag on the seat beside him. ' Don't say anything
to your master yet, Saymore,' he said, when
he got down, being familiar with all the servants,
and the habits of the house, as if it had been his
own. ' Do you think you could manage to get me a
few words privately with Miss Anne ? '

If I might make bold to ask, sir,' said Saymore,
is it true as there is something up about Miss Anne ?
Things is said and things is intend, and we're interested,
and we don't know what to think. Is it
along of that gentleman, Mr. Loseby ? Master is set
against the match, I know as much as that.'

I dare say you're right,' said the lawyer. ' An

old family servant like you, Saymore, sees many
things that the rest of the world never guess at.
Hold your tongue about it, old fellow, that's all I've
got to say. And try whether you can bring me to
speech of Miss Anne. Don't let anyone else know.
You can manage it, I feel sure.'

I'll try, sir,' Saymore said, and he went through
the house on tiptoe from room to room, looking for
his young mistress, with the air of a conspirator in
an opera, doing everything he could to betray himself.
When he found her, he stole behind a large
screen, and made mysterious gestures which everybody
saw. ' \\'hat is it, Saymore ? ' asked Anne.
Then Saymore pointed downstairs, with jerks over
his shoulder, and much movement of his eyebrows.
There's somebody. Miss Anne, as wants a word with
you,' he said, with the deepest meaning. Anne's
heart began to beat. Could it be Cosmo come
boldly, in person, to comfort her ? She was in the
billiard-room with Rose and Heathcote. She put
down the cue which she had been using with very
little energy or interest, and followed the old man to

the hall. * Who is it, Saymore ? ' she asked tremulously.
' It's some one that's come for your good. I
hope you'll listen to him, Miss Anne, I hope you'll
listen to him.' Anne's heart was in her mouth. If
he should have come so far to see her, to support
her, to make up for the deficiency of his letter ! She
seemed to tread on air as she went down the long
passages. And it was only Mr. Loseby after all !

The disappointment made her heart sink. She
could scarcely speak to him. It was like falling
down to earth from the skies. But Mr. Loseby did
not notice this. He put his arm into hers as the
rector did, with a fatherly familiarity, and drew her
to the large window full of the greyness of the pale
and misty November sky. ' I have something to
Bay to you, my dear Miss Anne  something that is
of consequence. My dear, do you know anything''
about the business that brings me here ? '

I know  that my father is making some alteration
in his will, Mr. Loseby. I don't know anymore
 why should I ?  I do not see why I should
believe that it has anything to do with me.'

Anne, my dear, I can't betray your father's
secrets ; but I am afraid it has something to do with
you. Now look here, my dear girl  why it is not
so long since you used to sit on my knee ! Tell me
what this is, which has made you quarrel with
papa '

Mr. Loseby !  I  do not know that I have
quarrelled with my father '

Don't be so stem, my dear child. Call him
papa. After all he is yom papa, Anne. Who was
so fond of you when you were a tiny creature ? I
remember you a baby in his arms, poor man ! when
he lost his first wife, before he married again. Your
mother died so young, and broke his life in two.
That is terribly hard upon a man. Think of him
in that light, my dear. He was wrapped up in
you when you were a baby. Come ! let me go to
him, an old friend, your very oldest friend, and say
you are ready to make it up.'

To make it up ?  but it is not a quarrel not
anything like a quarrel.'

Yes, yes, it is  I know better. Only say that

you will do nothing without his consent ; that you
will form no engagement ; that you will give up
corresponding and all that. You ought to, my dear ;
it is your duty. And when it will save you from
what would inconvenience you all your life ! What,
Anne, you are not going to be offended with what I
say, your oldest friend ? '

Mr. Loseby, you do not understand,* she said.
She had attempted, in her impatience, to withdraw
her arm from his. ' He said " Grive up "  I do not
wish to conceal who it is  "give up Mr. Douglas,
or I will take away your portion and give it to your
sister." What could I say ? Could I show so little
faith in the choice I had made  so little  so little
regard for the gentleman I am going to marry,
as to say, " I prefer my fortune ? " I will not
do it; it would be falsehood and baseness. This
is all the alternative I have ever had. It is like
saying, " Your money or your life " '

In that case one gives the money, Anne, to
save the life.'

And so I have done,' she said, proudly. ' Dear

Mr. Loseby, I don't want to vex you. I don't want
to quarrel with anyone. Can I say, when it is not
true  " I have changed my mind, I like the money
best ? " Don't you see that I could not do that ?
then what can I do ? '

You can give in, my dear, you can give in,'
repeated the lawyer. ' No use for entering into
particulars. So long as you authorise me to say you
give in  that is all, I am sure, that is needful.
Don't turn me off, Anne  give me the pleasure of
reconciling you, my dear.'

Mr. Loseby had always given himself out as one
of Anne's adorers. His eyes glistened with the
moisture in them. He pressed her arm within his.
Come, my dear ! I never was a father myself, which
I have always regretted ; but I have known you all
your life. Let me do you a good turn  let me put
a stop to all this nonsense, and tell him you will
make it up.'

Anne's heart had sunk very low ; with one assault
of this kind after another she was altogether discouraged.
She did not seem to care what she said,

or what interpretation was put upon her words.
You may say what you please,' she said. ' I will
make it up, if you please : but what does that mean,
Mr. Loseby ? I will give up writing, if he wishes it
but how can I give up the  gentleman I am
engaged to ? Do you think I want to quarrel ?
Oh, no, no  but what can I do ? Grive up !  I have
no right. He has my promise and I have his. Can
I sell that for money ? ' cried Anne, indignantly.
I will do whatever papa pleases  except that.'

You are making him do a dreadful injustice,
Anne. Come, what does this young fellow say?
Does he not want to release you, to save you from
suffering ? does he hold you to your promise in the
face of such a loss ? An honourable young man
would tell you : never mind me '

Anne detached her arm with a little energy from
his. ' Why should you torment me ? ' she cried.
An honourable man ?  is it honour, then, to prefer,
as you said yourself, one's money to one's life ? '

My dear child, money is always there, it is
always to be relied upon; it is a strong back, whatever

happens  whereas this, that you call life 1 '

cried Mr. Loseby, spreading out his hands and lifting
up his eyebrows ; he had chosen the very image
she had herself used when writing to her lover.
Was this then what they all thought, that wealth
was the best thing to fall back upon ? She smiled,
but it was a smile of pain.

If I thought so, I should not care either for the
life or the money,' she said.

Mr. Loseby held up his hands once more. He
shook his shining little bald head, and took up his
blue bag from the table. ' You are as obstinate, as
pig-headed, the whole family of you  one worse than
another,' he said.

CHAPTER XVIII.

AFTERTHOUGHTS.

There were two witnesses wanted for the will ; one
of these was Heathcote Montfort, the other the
clerk whom Mr. Lovely had brought with him in his
phaeton. He stood by himself, looking as like an
indignant prophet whose message from heaven has
been disregarded, as a fat little shining man of five
feet four could look. It had been to make a last
attempt upon the mind of Mr. Montfort, and also
to try what effect he could produce on the heart of
Anne, that he had come himself, facing all the risks
of an east wind, with perhaps snow to come. And
there had been a long and stormy interview in the
library before the clerk had been called in. ' She
will give up the correspondence. She is as sweet asa
girl can be,' said the old lawyer, fibbing manfully ;

one can see that it goes to her heart that you should
think her disobedient. Montfort, you don't half
know what a girl that is. But for the money she
would come to you, she would put herself at your
feet, she would give up everything. But she says,
bless her ! " Papa would think it was because of the
money. Do you think I would do that for the
money which I wouldn't do to please him ? " That's
Anne all over,' said her mendacious advocate. ' After
you have accomplished this injustice and cut her off,
that sweet creature will come to you some fine day
and say, " Papa, I give him up. I give everything
up that displeases you  I cannot go against my
duty." '

There was a slight attempt at imitation of
Anne's voice in jNIr. Loseby's tone ; he tried a higher
key when he made those imaginary speeches on her
behalf : but his eyes were glistening all the time :
he did not intend to be humorous. And neither
was Mr. Montfort a man who saw a joke. He took
it grimly without any softening.

When she does that, Loseby, if I see reason

to believe that she means it, I'll make another
will.'

You speak at your ease of making another will
are you sure you will have it in your power ?
When a man makes an unjust will, I verily believe
every word is a nail in his coffin. It is very seldom,'
said Mr. Loseby, with emphasis, carried away by his
feelings, ' that they live to repent.'

Mr. Montfort paled in spite of himself. He
looked up sharply at his mentor, then laughed a
short uneasy laugh. ' There's nothing like a partisan,'
he said; ' I call that brutal  if it were not so
silly, Loseby  unworthy a man of your sense.'

By ! ' the lawyer cried to relieve himself, ' I

don't see the silliness ; when you've taken a wrong
step that may plunge other people into misery, I
cannot see how you can have any confidence, even in
the protection of Grod ; and you are not in your first
youth any more than myself. The thought of dying
can't be put aside at your age or at my age, Mount-ford,
as if we were boys of twenty. We have got to
think of it, whether we will or not.*

This address made Mr. Montfort furious. He
felt no occasion at all in himself to think of it ; it
was a bnital argument, and quite beyond all legitimate
discussion; but nevertheless it was not pleasant.
He did not like the suggestion. ' Perhaps you'll call
that clerk of yours, and let us finish the business,
before we get into fancy and poetry. I never knew
you were so imaginative,' he said, with a sneer ; but
his lips were bluish, notwithstanding this attempt at
disdain. And Mr. Loseby stood with his spectacles
pushed up on his forehead, as if with a desire not to
see, holding his little bald head high in the air, with
a fine indignation in every line of his figure. Heath-cote,
who was brought in to sign as one of the witnesses,
felt that it needed all his consciousness of the
importance of what was going on to save him from
indecorous laughter. When INIr. Montfort said, ' I
deliver this,' ' And I protest against it,' Mr. Loseby
cried, in a vehement undertone, ' protest against it
before earth and heaven.' ' Do you mean little
Thompson there and Heathcote Montfort ? ' said the
testator, looking up with a laugh that was more like

a snarl. And Heathcote too perceived that his very
lips were palish, bluish, and the hand not so steady
as usual with which he pushed the papers away.
But Mr. Montfort recovered himself with great
courage. ' Now that I have finished my business,
we will have time to consider your proposition,' he
said, putting his hand on Heathcote's shoulder as he
got up from his chair. ' That is, if you have time
to think of anything serious in the midst of all this
ball nonsense. You must come over for the ball,
Loseby, a gay young bachelor like you.'

You forget I am a widower, Mr. Montfort,'
said the lawyer, with great gravity.

To be sure ; I beg your pardon ; but you are
always here when there is anything going on ; and
while the young fools are dancing, we'll consider this
question of the entail.'

I don't know what he means,' Mr. Loseby said,
some time after taking Heathcote into a corner ;
consider the question of the entail the moment he
has made another will I I'll tell you what it is  he
is repenting already. I thought what I said couldn't

be altogether without effect. St. John Montfort is
as obstinate as a pig, but he is not a fool. I thought
he must be touched by what I said. That's how it
is ; he would not seem to give in to us ; but if you
agree on this point, it will be a fine excuse for
beginning it all over again. That's a new light
and it's exactly like him  it's St. John Mount-ford
all over,' said the lawyer, rubbing his hands ;
'as full of crotchets as an egg is full of meat
but yet not such a bad fellow after all.'

The household, however, had no such consoling
consciousness of the possibility there was of having
aU done over again, and there was a great deal
of agitation on the subject, both upstairs and down.
Very silent upstairs  where Mrs. Montfort, in
mingled compunction on Anne's account and half-guilty
joy (though it was none of her doing she
said to herself) in respect to Rose's (supposedly)
increased fortune, was reduced to almost complete
dumbness, her multiplicity of thoughts making it
impossible to her to share in Rose's chatter about the
coming ball ; and where Anne, satisfied to think that

YOL. II. H

whatever was to happen had happened, and could no
longer be supposed to depend upon any action of hers,
sat proud and upright by the writing-table, reading
and altogether out of the talk which Rose carried
on, and was quite able to carry on whatever
happened, almost entirely by herself. Rose had the
same general knowledge that something very important
was going on as the rest ; but to her tranquil
mind, a bird in the hand was always more interesting
than two or three in the bush. Downstairs, however,
Saymore and Worth and the cook were far from
silent. They had a notion of the state of affairs
which was wonderfully accurate, and a strong conviction
that Miss Anne for her sins had been deposed
from her eminence and Miss Rose put in her place.
The feeling of Saymore and the cook was strong in
Anne's favour, but Mrs. Worth was not so certain.
Miss Rose is a young lady that is far more patient
to have her things tried on,' Worth said. Saymore
brought down an account of the party in the
drawing-room, which was very interesting to the
select party in the housekeeper's room. ' Missis by

the side of the fire, as serious as a judge  puckering
up her brows  never speaking a word.'

I dare say she was counting,' said Worth.

And Miss Anne up by the writing-table, with
her back against the wall, reading a book, never
taking no notice no more than if she were seventy ;
and Miss Eose a-chattering. The two before the
fire had it all their own way. They were writing-down
and counting up all the folks for this dance.
Dash the dance I ' said Saymore ; ' that sort of a
nonsense is no satisfaction to reasonable folks.
But Miss Eose, she's as merry as a cricket with her
Cousin Heathcote and Cousin Heathcote at every
word. She knows it's all to her advantage what's
been a-doing to-day.'

That might be a match, I shouldn't wonder 
eh ! ' said the cook, who was from the north-country ;
the luck as some folks have  I never can understand
these queer wills ; why can't gentlefolks do
like poor folks, and divide fair, share and share
alike ? As for what you call entail, I don't make
head or tail of it ; but if Miss Eose's to get all the
H 2

brass, and marry the man with the land, and Miss-anne
to get nought, it's easy to see that isn't fair.'

If it's the cousin you mean,' said Mrs. Worth,
he is just twice too old for Miss Eose.'

Then he will know how to take care of her,' said
Saymore, which made the room ring with laughter :
for though the affairs of the drawing-room were
interesting, there was naturally a still warmer attraction
in the drama going on downstairs.

Mr. Montfort was in his room alone. He had
retired there after dinner, as was his custom. At
dinner he had been very serious. He had not been
able to get Mr. Loseby's words out of his mind.
Every word a nail in his coffin ! What superstitious
folly it was! No man ever died the sooner for
attending to his affairs, for putting them in order,
he said to himself. But this was not simply putting
them in order. His mind was greatly disturbed.
He had thought that, as soon as he had done it he
would be relieved and at ease from the pressure of
the irritation which had disturbed him so ; but now
that it was done he was more disturbed than ever.

Perhaps for the first time he fully realised that, if
anything should happen to himself, one of his
-children would be made to sustain the cruellest disappointment
and wrong. * It will serve her right,'
he tried to say to himself, ' for the way she
has behaved to me ; ' but when it became really
apparent to him that this would be, not merely a
tremendous rebuff and discomfiture for Anne, but a
settled fate which she could not escape, a slight
shiver ran through him. He had not seen this so
plainly before. He had meant to punish her, cruelly,
even bitterly, and with an ironical completeness.
But then he had never meant to die. This made a
greater difference than it was possible to say. He
meant that she should know that her marriage was
impossible ; that he had the very poorest opinion of
the man she had chosen ; that he would not trust
him, and was determined never to let him handle a
penny of his (mr. Mount ford's) money. In short,
he said to himself, what he meant was to save Anne
from this adventurer, who would no longer wish to
marry her when he knew her to be penniless. He

meant, he persuaded himself, that his will should have
this effect in his lifetime ; he meant it to be known
and set things right, not in the future, but at once.
Now that all was done he saw the real meaning of
the tremendous instrument he had made for the first
time. To save Anne from an adventurer  not to die
and leave her without provision, not really to give anything
away from her, though she deserved it after the
way in which she had defied him, had been his intention.
Mr. Montfort thought this over painfully, not able
to think of anything else. Last night even, no later,
he had been thinking it over vindictively, pleased with
the cleverness and completeness with which he had
turned the tables upon his daughter. It had pleased
him immoderately before it was done. But now that
it was done, and old Loseby, like an old fool, had thrown
in that bit of silly superstition about the nails in his
coffin, it did not please him any longer. His face
had grown an inch or two longer, nothing like a
smile would come whatever he might do. When his
wife came ' to sit with him,' as she often did,,
perturbed herself, half frightened, half exultant, and

eager to learn all she could, he sent her away impatiently.
' I have a great deal to do,' he said.
What do I care for your ball ? For heaven's sake
let me have a little quiet. I have a great mind to

say that there shall be no ball ' 'Papal' his

wife said, ' you would not be so unkind. Rose has

set her heart on it so.' ' Oh confound ! ' he

said. Did he mean confound Eose, whom he had
just chosen to be his heir, whom he had promoted to
the vacant place of Anne ? AU through this strange
business Mrs. Montfort's secret exultation, when
she dared to permit herself to indulge it, in the good
fortune of her daughter had been chequered by a
growing bitterness in the thought that, though Eose
was to have the inheritance, Anne still retained by
far the higher place even in her husband's thoughts.
He was resolved apparently that nobody should have
any satisfaction in this overturn  not even the one
person who was benefited. Mrs. Montfort went
away with a very gloomy countenance after the confound
I The only thing that gave her any consolation
was to see the brisk conversation going on

between her daughter and Heathcote Montfort.
Anne sat stiff and upright, quite apart from them,
reading, but the two who were in front of the cheerful
fire in the full light of the lamp were chattering
with the gayest ease. Even Mrs. Montfort wondered
at Eose, who surely knew enough to be a little
anxious, a little perturbed as her mother was  but
who showed no more emotion than the cricket that
chirped on the hearth. Was it mere innocence and
childish ease of heart, or was it that there was no
heart at all ? Even her mother could not understand
her. And Heathcote, too, who knew a great deal, if
not all that was going on, though he threw back
lightly the ball of conversation, wondered at the
gaiety of this little light-minded girl who was not
affected, not a hair's breadth, by the general agitation
of the house, nor by the disturbed countenance
f her mother, nor by her sister's seriousness. He
talked  it was against his principles not to respond
to the gay challenges thrown out to him  but he
wondered. Did she know nothing, though everybody
else knew ? Was she incapable of divining that other

people were in trouble ? The conversation was very
lively in front of the fire, but he, too, as well as the
others, wondered at Rose.

And Mr. Montfort alone in his library thought,
and over again thought. Supposing after all,
incredible as it seemed, that he was to die f He did
not entertain the idea, but it took possession of him
against his will. He got up and walked about the
room in the excitement it caused. He felt his pulse
almost involuntarily, and was a little comforted to
feel that it was beating just as usual ; but if it should
happen as Loseby said ? He would not acknowledge
to himself that he had done a wrong thing, and yet,
if anything of that sort were to take place, he could
not deny that the punishment he had inflicted was
too severe. Whereas, as he intended it, it was nota
punishment, but a precaution ; it was to prevent
Anne throwing herself away upon an adventurer, a
nobody. Better even that she should have no money
than be married for her money, than fall into the
hands of a man unworthy of her. But then,
supposing he were to die, and this will, made 

certainly, as he persuaded himself, as a mere precautionary
measure  should become final? That
would make a very great difference. For a longtime
Mr. Montfort thought over the question. He
was caught in his own net. After all that had been
said and done, he could not change the will that he
had made. It was not within the bounds of possibility
that he should send for that little busybody
again and acknowledge to him that he had made a
mistake. What was there that he could do ? He
sat up long beyond his usual hour. Saymore
extremely curious and excited by so strange an
incident, came to his door three several times to see
that the fire was out and to extinguish the lamp,
and received the last time such a reception as sent
the old man hurrying along the passages at a pace
nobody had ever seen him adopt before, as if in danger
of his life. Then Mrs. Montfort came, very anxious,
on tiptoe in her dressing-gown, to see if anything
was the matter ; but she too retired more quickly
than she came. He let his fire go out, and his lamp
burn down to the last drop of oil  and it was only

when he had no more light to go on with, and was
chilled to death, that he lighted his candle and
made his way to his own room through the silent
house.

The victim herse If was somewhat sad. She had
spent the evening in a proud and silent indignation,
saying nothing, feeling the first jar of fate, and the
strange pang'of the discovery that life was not what she
had thought, but far less moved by what her father
bad done than by the failure round of her understanding
and support. And when she had gone to
her room, she had cried as did not misbecome her sex
and her age, but then had read Cosmo's letter over
again, and had discovered a new interpretation for it,
and reading between the lines, bad found it all
generosity and nobleness, and forthwith reconciled
herself to life and fate. But her father had no such
ready way of escape. He was the master of Anne's
future in one important respect, the arbiter of the
family existence, with the power of setting up one
and putting down another ; but he had no reserve of
imaginative strength, no fund of generous and high-flown

sentiment, no love-letter to restore his courage.
He did what he could to bring that courage back.
During the hours which he spent unapproachable in
his library, he had been writing busily, producing
pages of manuscript, half of which he had destroyed
as soon as it was written. At the end, however, he
so far satisfied himself as to concoct something of
which he made a careful copy. The original he put
into one envelope, the duplicate into another,
and placed these two packets in the drawer of his
writing-table, just as his light failed him. As he
went upstairs his cold feet and muddled head caused
him infinite alarm, and he blamed himself in his
heart for risking his health. "VMiat he had done in his
terror that night might have been left till tomorrow ;
whereas he might have caught cold, and cold might
lead to bronchitis. Every word a nail in his coffin I
What warrant had Loseby for such a statement ? Was
there any proof to be given of it ? Mr. Montfort's
head was buzzing and confused with the unusual
work and the still more unusual anxiety. Perhaps
he had caught an illness; he did not feel able to

think clearly or even to understand his own apprehensions.
He felt his pulse again before he went to
bed. It was not feverish  yet : but who could tell
what it might be in the morning ? And his feet
were so cold that he could not get any warmth
in them, even though he held them close to the
dying fire.

He was not, however, feverish in the morning,
and his mind became more placid as the day went on.
The two packets were safe in the drawer of the
writing-table. He took them out and looked at them
as a man might look at a bottle of quack medicine,
clandestinely secured and kept in reserve against an
emergency. He would not care to have his possession
of it known, and yet there it was, should the occasion
to try it occur. He felt a little happier to know that
he could put his hands upon it should it be wanted
or at least a little less alarmed and nervous. And
days passed on without any symptoms of cold or
other illness. There was no sign or sound of these
nails driven into his cofiBn. And the atmosphere
grew more clear in the house. Anne, between whom

and himself there had been an inevitable reserve
and coldness, suddenly came out of that cloud, and
presented herself to him the Anne of old, with all
the sweetness and openness of nature. The wrong
had now been accomplished, and was over, and there
was a kind of generous amusement to Anne in the
consternation which her sudden return to all her old
habits occasioned among the people surrounding her,
who knew nothing of her inner life of imaginative
impulse and feeling. She took her cottage-plans
into the library one morning with her old smile as if
nothing had happened or could happen. The plans
had been all pushed aside in the silent combat
between her father and herself. Mr. Montfort could
not restrain a little outburst of feeling, which had
almost the air of passion. ' Why do you bring them
to me ? Don't you know you are out of it, Anne ?
Don't you know I have done  what I told you I
should do ? '

I heard that you had altered your will, papa ;
but that does not affect the cottagers. They are
always there whoever has the estate ? '

Don't you mind, then, who has the estate ? '

Yes, immensely,' said Anne, with a smile. ' I
could not have thought I should mind half so much. I
have felt the coming down and being second. But I
am better again. You have a right to do what you
please, and I shall not complain.'

He sat in his chair at his writing-table (in the
drawer of which were still those two sealed packets)
and looked at her with contemplative, yet somewhat
abashed eyes. There was an unspeakable relief in
being thus entirely reconciled to her, notwithstanding
the sense of discomfiture and defeat it gave him.
Do you think  your sister  will be able to manage
property ? ' he said.

No doubt she will marry, papa.'

Ah ! ' he had not thought of this somehow. ' She
will marry, and my substance will go into the hands
of some stranger, some fellow I never heard of ; thai
is a pleasant prospect : he wil be a fool most likely,
whether he is an adventurer or not.'

We must aU take our chance, I suppose,' said
Anne, with a little tremor in her voice. She knew

the adventurer was levelled at herself. ' I suppose
you have made it a condition that he shall take the
name of Montfort, papa ? '

He made her no reply, but looked up suddenly
with a slight start. Oddly enough he had made no
stipulation in respect to Rose. It had never occurred
to him that it was of the slightest importance what
name Rose's husband should bear. He gave Anne a
sudden startled look ; then, for he would not commit
himself, changed the subject abruptly. After this
interval of estrangement it was so great a pleasure
to talk to Anne about the family affairs. ' What
do you think,' he said, ' about Heathcote's proposal,
Anne ? '

I should have liked to jump at it, papa. Mount
in our own family ! it seemed too good to be true.'

Seemed ! you speak as if it were in the past.
I have not said no yet. I have still got the offer in
my power. Mount in our own family ! but we have
not got a family  a couple of girls ! '

If we had not been a couple of girls there
would have been no trouble about the entail,' said

Anne, permitting herself a laugh. ' And of course
Eose's husband '

I know nothing about Hose's husband,' he cried
testily. ' I never thought of him. And so you can
talk of all this quite at your ease ? ' he added. ' You
don't mind ? '

This was a kind of offence to him, as well as a
satisfaction. She had no right to think so little of
it ; and yet what a relief it was !

Anne shook her head and smiled. ' It is better
not to talk of it at all,' she said.

This conversation had a great effect upon !Mr.
Montfort. Though perhaps it proved him more
wrong than ever, it restored him to all the ease of
family intercourse which had been impeded of late.
And it feet the whole house right. Anne, who lead
been in the shade, behind backs, resigning many of
her usual activities on various pretences, came back
naturally to her old place. It was like a transformation
scene. And everybody was puzzled, from
Mrs. Montfort, who could not understand it at all,
and Heathcote, who divined that some compromise

VOL. II. 1

had been erected, to the servants, whose interest in
Miss Anne rose into new warmth, and who concluded
that she had found means at last 'to come overmaster,'
which was just what they expected from her.
After this everything went on very smoothly, as if
the wheels of life had been freshly oiled, and velvet
spread over all its roughnesses. Even the preparations
for the ball proceeded with far more spirit than
before. The old wainscoted banqueting-room, which
had not been used for a long time, though it was the
pride of the house, was cleared for dancing, and
Anne had already begun to superintend the decoration
of it. Everything went on more briskly from
the moment that she took it in hand, for none of
the languid workers had felt that there was any
seriousness in the preparations till Anne assumed
the direction of them. Heathcote, who was making
acquaintance very gradually with the differing
characters of the household, understood this sudden
activity less than anything before. ' Is it for love of
dancing ? ' he said. Anne laughed and shook her
head.

I don't know that I shall enjoy this ball much ;
but I am not above dancing  and I enjoy thisbe she
said. * I like to be doing something,' To have
regained her own sense of self-command, her superiority
to circumstances, made this magnanimous
young woman happy in her downfall. She liked the
knowledge that she was magnanimous almost more
than the good fortune and prosperity which she had
lost. She had got over her misfortunes. She gave
her head a little toss aloft, shaking off all shadows,
as she ran hither and thither, the soul of everything.
She had got the upper hand of fate.

As for mr. Montfort, he had a great deal more
patience about the details of the approaching entertainment
when Anne took them in hand. Either
she managed to make them amusing to him, or the
additional reality in the whole matter, from the
moments he put herself at the head of affairs, had
a corresponding effect upon her father. Perhaps,
indeed, a little feeling of making up to her, by a
more than ordinary readiness to accept all her lesser
desires, was in his mind. His moroseness melted

I 2

away. He forgot his alarm about his health and
Mr. Loseby's ugly words. It is possible, indeed, that
he might have succeeded in forgetting altogether
what he had done, or at least regaining his feeling
that it was a mere expedient to overawe Anne and
bring her into order, liable to be changed as everything
changes  even wills, when there are long years
before the testator  but for the two sealed envelopes
in his drawer which he could not help seeing every
time he opened it. A day or two before the ball some
business called him into Hunston, and he took them
out with a half smile, weighing them in his hand.
Should he carry them with him and put them in
Loseby's charge ? or should he leave them there ?
He half laughed at the ridiculous expedient to which
Loseby's words had driven him, and looked at the
two letters jocularly ; but in the end he determined
to take them. It would be as well to put them in
old Loseby's hands. Heathcote volunteered to ride
with him as he had done before. It was again a
bright calm day, changed only in so far as November
is different from October. There had been stormy

weather in the meantime, and the trees were almost
bare ; but still it was fine and bright. Anne came
out from the hall and stood on the steps to see them
ride off. She gave them several commissions : to inquire
at the bookseller's for the ball programmes,
and to carry to the haberdasher's a note of something
Mrs. Worth wanted. She kissed her hand to her
father as he rode away, and his penitent heart gave
him a prick. * You would not think that was a girl
that had just been cut off with a shilling,' he said,
half mournfully (as if it had been a painful necessity),
and half with parental braggadocio, proud of
her pluck and spirit.

I thought you must have changed your mind,'

Heath cote said.

Mr. Montfort shook his head and said, 'No,
worse luck. I have not changed my mind.'

This was the only expression of changed sentiment
to which he gave vent. "Wien they called at
Mr. Loseby's, the lawyer received them with a mixture
of satisfaction and alarm. 'What's up now?'
he said, coming out of the door of his private room

to receive them. ' I thought I should see you presently.'
But when he was offered the two sealed
letters Mr. Loseby drew back his hand as if he had
been stung. ' You have been making another will,'
he said, ' all by yourself, to ruin your family and
make work for us lawyers after you are dead and
gone.'

No,' said Mr. Montfort, eagerly, ' no, no  it is
only some stipulations.'

The packets were each inscribed with a legend
on the outside, and the lawyer was afraid of them.
He took them gingerly with the ends of his fingers,
and let them drop into one of the boxes which lined
his walls. As for Mr. Montfort, he became more
jaunty and pleased with himself every moment. He
went to the haberdasher's for Mrs. Worth, and
to the stationer's to get the programmes which had
been ordered for the ball. He was more cheerful
than his companion had ever seen him. He opened
the subject of the entail of his own accord as they
went along. * Losebj is coming for the ball : it is a
kind of thing he likes ; and then we shall talk it

over,' he said. Perhaps in doing this a way might
be found of setting things straight, independent of
these sealed packets, which, however, in the meantime,
were a kind of sop to fate, a propitiation to
]Nemesis. Then they rode home in cheerful talk.
By the time night fell they had got into the park ;
and though the trees stood up bare against the dark
blue sky, and the grass looked too wet and spungy
for pleasant riding, there was still some beauty in
the dusky landscape. Mount, framed in its trees
and showing in the distance the cheerful glow of its
lights, had come in sight. ' It is a pleasant thing to
come home, and to know that one is looked for and
always welcome,' Mr. Montfort said. Heathcote
had turned round to answer, with some words on his
lips about his own less happy lot, when suddenly the
t&gure at his side dropped out of the dusk around
them. There was a muffled noise, a floundering of
horse's hoofs, a dark heap upon the grass, moving,
Struggling, yet only half discernible in the gloom,
over which he almost stumbled and came to the
ground also, so sudden was the fall. His own horse

swerved violently, just escaping its companion's hoof.
And through the darkness there ran a sharp broken
cry, and then a groan : which of them came from hi
own lips Heathcote did not know.

Chapter XIX.

THE CATASTROPHE.

All was pleasant commotion and stir in Mount,
where almost every room had received some addition to
its decoration. On this particular evening there was
a great show of candles in the old banqueting hall,
which was to be the ballroom, and great experiments
in lighting were going on. The ball at
Mount was stirring the whole county. In all the
houses about there was more or less commotion,
toilets preparing, an additional thrill of liveliness
and pleasure sent into the quiet country life. And
Mount itself was all astir. Standing outside, it
was pretty to watch the lights walking about the
ful house, gHding along the long corridors, gleaming
at windows along the whole breadth of the
rambling old place. With aU these Hghts streaming
out into the night, the house seemed to warm

the evening air, which was now white with inevitable
mists over the park. Eose ran about like a
child, delighted with the stir, dragging holly
wreaths after her, and holding candles to all the
workers ; but Anne had the real work in hand. It
was to her the carpenters came for their orders, and
the servants who never knew from one half-hour to
another what next was to be done. Mrs. Montfort
had taken the supper under her charge, and sat
serenely over her worsted work, in the consciousness
that whatever might go wrong, that, at least, would
be right. 'As for your decorations, I wash my
hands of them,' she said. It was Anne upon whom
all these cares fell. And though she was by no
means sure that she would enjoy the ball, it was
quite certain, as she had said to Heathcote, that she
enjoyed this. She enjoyed the sensation 'of being
herself again, and able to throw herself into this
occupation with a fine indifference to her own
personal standing in the house. If she had been
dethroned in the will, only herself could dethrone
her in nature. She felt, as she wished to feel, that

she was above all that ; that she was not even under
the temptation of sullenness, and had no sense of
injury to turn the sweet into bitter. She went about
holding her head consciously a little higher than
usual, as with a gay defiance of all things that
could pull her down. Who could pull her down,
save herself? And what was the use of personal
happiness, of that inspiration and exhilaration of
love which was in her veins, if it did not make her
superior to all little external misfortunes ? She felt
magnanimous, and to feel so seemed to compensate
her for everything else. It would have been strange,
indeed, she said to herself, if the mere loss of a fortune
had sufficed to crush the spirit of a happy woman, a
woman beloved, with a great life before her. She
smiled at fate in her faith and happiness. Her head
borne higher than usual, thrown back a Little, her
eyes shining, a smile, in which some fine contempt
for outside trouble just touched the natural sweetness
of her youth, to which, after all, it was so natural
to take pleasure in all that she was about  all these
signs and marks of unusual commotion in her mind,

of the excitement of a crisis about her, struck the
spectators, especially the keen-sighted ones below
stairs. ' It can't be like we think. She's the conquering
hero. Miss Anne is. She's just like that army
with banners as is in the Bible,' said the north-country
cook. ' I don't understand her not a bit,' Saymore
said, who knew better, who was persuaded that Anne
had not conquered. Mrs. Worth opined that it was
nature and nothing more. ' A ball is a ball, however
coldhearted you may be ; it cheers you up, whatever
is a going to happen,' she said ; but neither did this
theory find favour in old Saymore's eyes.

What a beehive it was ! Rooms preparing for
the visitors who were to come tomorrow, linen put
out to air, fires lighted, housemaids busy; in the
kitchen all the cook's underlings, with aids from the
village, already busy over the ball supper. Even
Mrs. Montfort had laid aside her worsted work, and
was making bows of ribbons for the cotillon. There
was to be a cotillon. It was ' such fun,' Rose had
said. In the ballroom the men were busy hammering,
fixing up wreaths, and hanging curtains. Both

the girls were there superintending, Rose half
encircled by greenery. There was so much going on,
so much noise that it was difficult to hear anything.
And it must have been a lull in the hammering, in
the consultation of the men, in the moving of step-ladders
and sound of heavy boots over the floor,
which allowed that faint sound to penetrate to
Arme's ear. WTiat was it ? ' 'VMaat was that ? ' she
cried. They listened a moment, humouring her.
What should it be ? The hammers were sounding
gaily, John Stokes, the carpenter belonging to the
house, mounted high upon his ladder, with tacks
in his mouth, his assistant holding up to him one of
the muslin draperies. The wreaths were spread out
over the floor. Now and then a maid put in her
head to gaze, and admire, and wonder. ' Oh, you
are always fancying something, Anne,' said Eose.
You forget how little time we have.' Then suddenly
it came again, and everybody heard. A long cry,
out of the night, a prolonged halloo. John Stokes
himself put down his hammer. ' It's somebody got
into the pond,' he said. * No, it's the other side of

the park,' said the other man. Anne ran out to the
corridor, and threw open the window at the end,
which swept a cold gust through all the house.
A wind seemed to have got up at that moment
though it had been calm before. Then it came
again, a long, far-echoing ' halloo  halloo help ! *
Was it ' help ' the voice cried ? No doubt it was an
appeal, whatever it was.

The men threw down their hammers and rushed
downstairs with a common instinct, to see what it
was. Anne stood leaning out of the window straining
her eyes in the milky misty air, which seemed to
grow whiter and less clear as she gazed. ' Oh,
please put down the window,' cried Eose, shivering,
*it is so cold  and what good can we do ? It is
poachers, most likely ; it can't be anybody in the
pond, or they wouldn't go on shrieking like that.'
Saymore, who had come up to look at the decorations,
gave the same advice. ' You'll get your death
of cold, Miss Anne, and you can't do no good ; maybe
it's something caught in a snare  they cry like
Christians, them creatures do, though we call 'em

dumb creatures ; or it's maybe a cart gone over on
the low road  the roads is very heavy ; or one of the
keepers as has found something ; it's about time for
Master and Mr. Heathcote coming back from
Hunston ; they'll bring us news. Don't you be
dervish. Miss Anne ; they'll see what it is. I've
known an old owl make just such a screeching.'

Could an owl say " halloo," ' said Anne, ' and
help " ? I am sure I heard " help." I hear somebody
galloping up to the door  no, it is not to the
door, it is to the stables. It will be papa or Heath-cote
come for help. I am sm-e it is something serious,'
she said. And she left the great window wide open,
and rushed downstairs. As for Rose she was very
chilly. She withdrew within the warmer shelter of
the ballroom, and arranged the bow of ribbon with
which one of the hangings was to be finished. ' Put
down the window,' she said ; ' it can't do anyone any
good to let the wind pour in like that, and chill all
the house.'

Heathcote had been half an hour alone in the
great wilderness of the park, nothing near him that

could help, the trees rustling in the wind, standing
far off round about like a scared circle of spectators,
folding up piteous hands to heaven, but giving no
aid. He was kneeling upon the horse's head, himself
no more than a protuberance in the fallen mass,
unable to get any answer to his anxious questions.
One or two groans were all that he could elicit,
groans which grew fainter and fainter ; he shouted
with all his might, but there seemed nothing thereto
reply  no passing labourer, no one from the village
making a short cut across the park, as he had seen
them do a hundred times. The mist rose up out of
the ground, choking him, and, he thought, stifling
his voice ; the echoes gave him back the faint
sounds which were all he seemed able to make.
His throat grew dry and hoarse. Now and
then the fallen horse gave a heave, and
attempted to fling out, and there would be
another scarcely articulate moan. His helplessness
went to his very heart; and there, almost within
reach, hanging suspended, as it were, between heaven
and earth, were the lights of the house, showing with

faint white haloes round them, those lights which had
seemed so full of warmth and welcome. When the
first of the help-bringers came running, wildly flashing
a lantern about, Heathcote's limbs were stiffened
and his voice scarcely audible ; but it required no
explanation to show the state of the case. His horse,
which had escaped when he dismounted, had made
its way to the stable door, and thus roused a still
more effectual alarm. Then the other trembling
brute was got to its legs, and the body liberated.
The body!  what did they mean? There was no
groan now or cry  ' Courage, sir, courage  a little
more patience and you will be at home,' Heathcote
heard himself saying. To whom? There was no
reply ; the groan would have been eloquence. But
he could not permit himself to believe that the
worst had come. He kept on talking, not knowing
what he was doing, while they brought something,
he did not know what, to place the motionless figure
upon. * Softly, softly I ' he cried to the men, and
took the limp hand into his own, and continued to
speak. He heard himself talking, going along,

VOL, II. K

repeating always the same words, ' A little longer,
only a little longer. Keep up your heart, sir, we are
nearly there.' When they had almost reached the
door of the house, one of the bearers suddenly burst
forth in a kind of loud sob, ' Don't you, sir, don't you
now !  don't you see as he'll never hear a spoken
word again ? '

Then Heathcote stopped mechanically, as he had
been speaking mechanically. His hat had been
knocked off his head. His dress was wet and
muddy, his hair in disorder, his whole appearance
wild and terrible. When the light from the door
fell full upon him, and Anne stepped forward, he
was capable of nothing but to motion her away with
his hand. ' What is it ? ' she said, in an awe-stricken
voice. * Don't send me away. I am not afraid.
Did papa find it ? He ought to come in at once.
Make him come in at once. What is it, Mr.
Heathcote ? I am not afraid.'

Send the young lady away, sir,' cried the groom,
imperatively.  Miss Anne, I can't bring him in till you
are out o' that. Grood Lord, can't you take her away ? '

I am not afraid,' she said, very pale, ranging
herself on one side to let them pass. Heathcote,
who did not know what it was, any more than she
did, laid a heavy hand upon her shoulder, and put
her, almost roughly, out of the way. ' I will go,'
she said, frightened. ' I will go  if only you will
make papa come in out of the damp  it is so bad for

his Ah ! ' She fell dovn upon her knees and

her cry rang through all the house. She had seen a
sudden light from a lantern out of doors flash
across the covered face, the locks of grey hair.

It was not long till everybody knew ; from the top
to the bottom of the great house the news ran in a
moment. John Stokes, the carpenter, returned and
mounted his ladder mechanically, to resume his
work : then remembered, and got down solemnly
and collected his tools, leaving one wreath up and
half of the drapery. ' There won't be no ball here this
time,' he said to his mate. ' You bring the step-ladder,
Sam.' This was the first sign that one cycle
of time, one reign was over, and another begun.

From that moment Heathcote Montfort's
K 2

position was changed. He felt it before he had gone
up the stairs, reverently following that which now he
no longer addressed with encouraging human words,
but felt to be the unapproachable and solemn thing
it was. A man had ridden off for the doctor before
they entered the house, but there was no question of
a doctor to those who now laid their' old master
upon his bed. ' I should say instantaneous, or next
to instantaneous,' the doctor said when he came ;
and when he heard of the few groans which had
followed the fall, he gave it as his opinion that
these had been but unconscious plaints of the body
after all sense of pain or knowledge of what was
happening had departed. The horse had put his
foot into a hole in the spongy wet turf  a thing
that might have happened any day, and which it
was a wonder did not happen oftener. There were
not even the usual questionings and wondering as
to how it came about, which are so universal when
death seizes life with so little warning. Mr. Mount-ford
had been in the habit of riding with a loose
rein. He had unbounded confidence in his cob,

which, now that the event had proved its danger,
a groom came forward to say by no means deserved
his confidence, but had two or three times
before stumbled with its rider. Heathcote felt that
doctors and grooms alike looked to himself with
something more than ordinary courtesy and respect.
He walked away from the comfortable bedroom now
turned into a solemn presence chamber, and all its
homely uses intermitted, with a gravity he had not
felt before for years. He was not this man's son,
scarcely his friend, that his death should affect him
so. But, besides the solemnity of the event thus
happening in his presence, it changed his position
even more than if he had been St. John Montfort's
son. It would be barbarous to desert the poor
women in their trouble ; but how was he to remain
here, a comparative stranger, their kinsman but
their supplanter, become in a moment the master of
the house in which these girls had been born, and
which their mother had ruled for twenty years. He
went to his room to change his wet and soiled
clothes, with a sense of confusion and sadness that

made everything unreal to him. His past as well
as that of his kinsman had ended in a moment ; his
careless easy life was over, the indulgences which
he had considered himself entitled to as a man upon
whom nobody but edward had any special claim.
Now Edward's claims, for which he had been willing
to sacrifice his patrimony, must be put aside perforce.
He could no longer think of the arrangement
which an hour ago he had been talking of so easily,
which was to have been accomplished with so little
trouble. It was in no way to be done now. Actually
in a moment he had become Montfort of Mount,
the representative of many ancestors, the proprietor
of an old house and property, responsible to dependents
of various kinds, and to the future and to the
past. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye ;
no idea of this kind had crossed his mind during that
long half-hour in the park, which looked like half a
year. A fatal issue had not occurred to him. It
was not until he had reached the threshold of the
house, until he felt hope and help to be near, until he
had heard Anne's voice appealing to him to know

what it was, that the whole meaning of it had burst
upon him. St. John Montfort dead, and he himself
master of the house I It was impossible that, apart
from the appalling suddenness of the catastrophe,
and the nervous agitation of his own share in it,
the death of his cousin even in this startling and
pitiful way should plunge him into grief. He was
deeply shocked and awed and impressed  sorry for
the ladies, stricken so unexpectedly with a double
doom, loss of their head, loss of their home  and
sorry beyond words for the poor man himself, thus
snatched out of life in a moment without preparation,
without any suggestion even of what was going to
happen ; but it was not possible that Heathcote
Montfort could feel any private pang in himself.
He was subdued out of all thought of himself, except
that strange sensation of absolute change. He dressed
mechanically, scarcely perceiving what it was he was
putting on, in his usual evening clothes which had
been laid out for him. just as if he had been dressing
for the usual peaceful dinner, his kinsman in the next
room doing the same, and the table laid for all the

family party. Notwithstanding the absolute change
that had occurred, the revolution in everything, what
could a man do but follow mechanically the habitual
customs of every day ?

He dressed very slowly, sometimes standing
by the fire idly for ten minutes at a time,
in a half stupor of excitement, restless yet benumbed
and incapable of either action or thought ;
and when this was accomplished went slowly along
the long corridors to the drawing-room, still as if
nothing had happened, though more had happened
than he could fathom or realise. The change had gone
down before him and was apparent in every corner of
the deserted place. There were two candles burning
feebly on the mantelpiece, and the fire threw a
little fitful light about, but that was all; and no
one was there; of course it was impossible that
anyone should be there  but Heathcote was strange
to family trouble, and did not know what happened
when a calamity like this came crashing down from
heaven into the midst of a household of people. Mrs.
Montfort's work was lying on the sofa with the

little sheaf of bright-coloured wools, which she had
been used to tuck under her arm when she went ' to
sit with papa , ' and on the writing-table there was the
rough copy of the ball programme, corrected for the
printer in Eose's hand. The programmes ; it floated
suddenly across his mind to recollect the commission
they had received on this subject as they had
ridden away ; had they fulfilled it? he asked himself
in his confusion ; then remembered as suddenly how
he who was lying upstairs had fulfilled it, and how
useless it now was. Ball programmes I and the giver
of the ball lying dead in the house within reach of
all the preparations, the garlands, and ornaments.
It was incredible, but it was true. Heathcote walked
about the dark and empty room in a maze of bewildered
trouble which he could not understand, troubled
for the dead, and for the women, and for himself,
who was neither one nor the other, who was the
person to profit by it. It was no longer they who
had been born here, who had lived and ruled here
for so many years, but he himself who was supreme
in the house. It was all his own. The idea neither

pleased him nor excited, but depressed and bewildered
him. His own house : and all his easy quiet
life in the Albany, and his little luxuries in the way
of art and of travel  all over and gone. It seemed
unkind to think of this in the presence of calamity
so much more serious. Yet how could he help it ?
When some one came with a soft knock at the door
he was startled as if it had been a ghost. It was
Saymore who came into the room, neat in his evening
apparel, dressed and trim whatever happened
making his little formal bow. 'The ladies, sir,'
Saymore said, conquering a little huskiness, a little
faltering in his own voice, ' send their compliments
and they don't feel equal to coming down. They
hope you will excuse them ; and dinner is served,
Mr. Montfort,' the old man said, his voice ending
in a jar of broken sound, almost like weeping.
Heathcote went downstairs very seriously, as if he
had formed one of the usual procession. He seated
himself at the end of the table, still decorated with all
its usual prettiness as for the family meal ; he did
all this mechanically, taking the place of the master

of the house, without knowing that he did so, and
sitting down as if with ghosts, with all those empty
seats round the table and every place prepared. Was
it real or was it a dream ? He felt that he could
see himself as in a picture, sitting there alone,
eating mechanically, going through a semblance of
the usual meal. The soup was set before him, and
then the fish, and then 

'Saymore, old man,' Heathcote said suddenly ,.
starting up, ' I don't know if this is a tragedy or a
farce we are playing  I cannot stand it any longer
  take all those things away.'

It do seem an awful change, sir, and so sudden,'
cried the old man, frightened by the sudden movement,
and by this departure from the rigid rules of
ceremony  yet relieved after his first start was over.
And then old Saymore began to sob, putting down
the little silver dish with the entree. ' I've been
his butler, sir, this thirty years, and ten years in the
pantry before that, footman, and born on the property
like. And all to be over, sir, in a moment ; and he
was a good master, sir, though strict. He was very

particular, but always a kind master. It'll be long
before we'll get another like bim  not but what I
beg your pardon, Mr. Montfort. I don't make no
doubt but them as serves you will give the same
character to you.'

This good wish relieved the oppression with a
touch of humour ; but Heathcote did not dare tolet
a smile appear. ' I hope so, sir,' Saymore said.
He rubbed his old eyes hard with his napkin. Then
he took up again the little silver dish. ' It's sweetbreads,
sir, and it won't keep ; it was a great favourite
with master. Have a little while it's hot. It will
disappoint cook if you don't eat a bit ; we must
eat, whatever happens, sir,' the old man said.

CHAPTER XX.

THE WILL.

It is needless to dwell upon the gloom of the days
that followed this event. Mr. Loseby came over
from Hamilton, as pale as he was rosy on ordinary
occasions, and with a self-reproach that was half
pathetic, half ludicrous. ' I said every word of that
new "still of his would be a nail in his coffin. Grod
forgive me,' he said. ' How was I to know ? A
man should never take upon himself to prophesy.
God knows what a murdering villain he feels if it
chances to come true.'

'But nothing you said could have made the
horse put his toot in that rabbit-hole,' Heathcote
said.

That is true, that is true,' said the little lawyer :
and then he began the same plaint again. But he

was very active and looked after everything, managing
the melancholy business of the moment, the
inquest, and the funeral. There was a great deal todo.
Telegrams flew about the country on all sides,
warning the guests invited to the ball of what had
happened  yet at least one carriage full of ladies in
full ball dress had to be turned back from the lodge
on the night when so much gaiety had been expected
at Mount. Charley Ashley had come up from the
rectory at once and took the position of confidential
agent to the ladies, in a way that Heathcote Mount-ford
could not do. He thought it wrong to forsake
them, and his presence was needed as mourner at
his cousin's funeral ; otherwise he would have been
glad to escape from the chill misery and solitude
that seemed to shut down upon the house which had
been so cheerful. He saw nothing of the ladies,
save that now and then he would cross the path of
Anne, who did not shut herself up like her stepmother
and sister. She was very grave, but still
she carried on the government of the house. When
Heathcote asked her how she was, she answered with

a serious smile, though with quick-coming moisture
in her eyes : ' I am not ill at all ; I am very well,
Mr, Heathcote. Is it not strange one's grief makes
no difference to one in that way ? One thinks it
must, one even hopes it must ; but it does not ; only
my heart feels like a lump of lead.' She was able
for all her work, just as usual, and saw Mr. Loseby
and gave Charley Ashley the list of all the people
to be telegraphed to, or to whom letters must be
written. But Mrs. Montfort and Eose kept to
their rooms, where all the blinds were carefully
closed and every table littered with crape. Getting
the mourning ready was always an occupation, and
it did them good. They all went in a close carriage
to the village chi-ch on the day of the funeral, but
only Anne followed her father's coffin to the grave.
It was when Heathcote stood by her there that he
remembered again suddenly the odiousness of the
idea that some man or other, a fellow whom nobody
knew, had managed to get between Anne Montfort
and all the rest of the world. It was not a place for
such a though , yet it came to him in spite of himself,

when he saw her falter for a moment and instinctively
put out his arm to sustain her. She
looked round upon him with a look in which gratitude
and something like a proud refusal of his aid
were mingled. That look suggested to him the
question which suddenly arose in his mind, though,
as he felt, nothing could be more inappropriate at
such a time and place. Where was the fellow ?
Why was he not here ? If he had permitted Anne
to be disinherited for his sake, why had he not
hurried to her side to support her in her trouble ?
Heathcote was not the only person who had asked
himself this question. The curate had not looked
through Anne's list of names before he sent intelligence
of Mr. Montfort's death to his friend. The
first person of whom he had thought was Cosmo.
Of course you will come to the rectory,' he telegraphed,
sending him the news on the evening of
the occurrence. He had never doubted that Cosmo
would arrive next morning by the earliest train. All
next day while he had been working for them, he
had expected every hour the sound of the arrival,

saying to himself, when the time passed for the
morning and for the evening trains, that Cosmo must
have been from home, that he could not have received
the message, that of course he would come
tomorrow. But when even the day of the funeral
arrived without Cosmo, Charley Ashley's good heart
was wrung with mingled wrath and impatience.
AATiat could it mean ? He was glad, so far as he
himself was concerned, for it was a kind of happiness
to him to be doing everything for Anne and her
mother and sister. He was proud and glad to think
that it was natural he should do it, he who was so old
a friend, almost like a brother to the girls. But the
other, who had a closer claim than that of any
brother, who had supplanted Charley and pushed
him aside, where was he ? On this subject Anne
did not say a word. She had written and received
various letters, but she did not take anyone into
her confidence. And yet there was a something in
her eyes, a forlorn look, a resistance of any support,
as if she had said to herself, ' Since I have not his
arm I will have no one else's support.' Heath-vol.
II. L

cote withdrew from her side with a momentary

sense of a rebuff. He followed her down the little

churchyard path and put her into the carriage,

where the others were waiting for her, without a

word. Then she turned round and looked at him

again. Was it an appeal for forgiveness, for sympathy

and yet for not too much sympathy  which Anne

was making ? These looks of mingled feeling which

have so much in them of the poetry of life, how

difficult they are to interpret ! how easily it may be

that their meaning exists only in the eyes that see

them ! like letters which may be written carelessly,

hastily, but which we weigh, every word of them, in

balances of the sanctuary, too fine and delicate for

earthly words, finding out so much more than the

writer ever thought to say. Perhaps it was only

Heathcote's indignant sense that the lover, for whom

she had already suffered, should have been by Anne's

side in her trouble that made him see so much in her

eyes. Charley Ashley had been taking a part in the

service ; his voice had trembled with real feeling ashe

read the psalms ; and a genuine tear for the man

whom he had known all his life had been in his eye ;
but he, too, had seen Anne's looks and put his own
interpretation upon them. "Mien all was over, he
came out of the vestry where he had taken off his
surplice and joined Heathcote. He was going upto
Mount, the general centre of everything at
this moment. The mourners were going there to
luncheon, and afterwards the wil was to be read.
Already, Mr. Montfort being safely in his grave,
covered with wreaths of flowers which everybody had
sent, the interest shifted, and it was of this will and
its probable revelations that everybody thought.

Have you any idea what it is ? ' the Curate said ;
you were in the house, you must have heard something.
It is inconceivable that a just man should be
turned into an unjust one by that power of making a
will. He was a good man,' Charley added, with a
little gulp of feeling. ' I have known him since I
was thxit high. He never talked very much about it,
but he never was hard upon anyone. I don't think
I ever knew him to be hard on anyone. He said
little, but I am sure he was a good man at heart.'

L 2

Heatbcote Montfort did not make any answer ;
he replied by another question : ' Mr. Douglas is a
friend of yours, I hear ? '

Oh, yes, he is a friend of mine : it was I  weare
such fools  that brought him. Just think  if it
brings harm to Anne, as everybody seems to believe
that I should have to reflect that I brought him !
I who would cut off a hand !  I see you are thinking
how strange it is that he is not here.'

It is strange,' Heatbcote said.

Strange ! strange is not the word. Why, even
Willie is here : and he that could have been of such

use . But we must remember that Anne hasher

own ways of thinking,' the Curate added. 'He
wrote half-a-dozen lines to me to say that he
was at her orders, that he could not act of himself.
Now, whether that meant "that she had forbidden
him to come  if so, there is a reason at
once.'

I don't think I should have been inclined to
take such a reason,' Heatbcote said.

The Curate sighed. How could he consider what

he would have done in such circumstances? he knew
that he would not have stopped to consider. ' You
don't know Anne,' he said :  one couldn't go against
her  no, certainly one couldn't go against her. If
she said don't come, you'd obey, whether you liked it
or not.'

'I don't think I should. I should do what I
thought right without waiting for anyone's order.
What ! a woman that has suffered for you, not to be
there, not to be by, when she was in trouble ! It is
inconceivable. Ashley, your friend must be a  he
must be, let us say the least '

Hush ! I cannot hear any ill of him, he has
always been my friend ; and Anne  do you think
anything higher could be said of a man than that
Anne  you know what I mean.'

Heathcote was very sympathetic. He gave a
friendly pressure to the arm that had come to be
linked in his as they went along. The Curate had
not been able to disburden his soul to anyone in
these days past, when it had been so sorely impressed
upon him that, though he could work for Anne, it was

not his to stand by her and give her the truest
support. Heathcote was sympathetic, and yet he
could scarcely help smiling within himself at this good
faithful soul, who, it was clear, had ventured to love
Anne too, and, though so faithful still, had an inward
wonder that it had been the other and not himself
that had been chosen. The looker-on could have
laughed, though he was so sorry. Anne, after all,
he reflected, with what he felt to be complete impartiality,
though only a country girl, was not the sort
of young woman to be appropriated by a curate : that
this good, heavy, lumbering fellow should sigh over
her choice of another, without seeing in a moment
that he and such as he was impossible! However,
he pressed Charley's arm in sympathy, even though
he could not refrain from this half derision in his
heart.

He might have stayed at the rectory,' Charley
continued; 'that is what I proposed  of course he
could not have gone to Mount without an invitation.
I had got his room all ready ; I sent our old
man up to meet two trains. I never for a moment

supposed  Willie, of course, never thought twice.
He came off from Cambridge as a matter of
course .'

As any one would ' said Heathcote.

Unless they had been specially forbidden to do it
there is always that to be taken into account.'

Thus talking, they reached the house, where,
though the blinds had been drawn up, the gloom
was still heavy. The servants were very solemn as
they served at table, moving as if in a procession,
asking questions about wine and bread in funereal
whispers. Old Saymore's eyes were red and his hand
unsteady. ' Thirty years butler, and before that ten
years in the pantry,' he said to everyone who would
listen to him. ' If I don't miss him, who should ?
and he was always the best of masters to me.' But
the meal was an abundant meal, and there were not
many people there whose appetites were likely to be
affected by what had happened. Mr. Loseby, perhaps,
was the one most deeply cast down, for he could not
help feeling that he had something to do with it,
and that St. John Montfort might still have been

living had he not said that about the words of an
unjust will being nails in the coffin of the nan who
made it. This recollection prevented him from
enjoying his meal ; but most of the others enjoyed
it. Many of the luxurious dainties prepared for
the ball supper appeared at this less cheerful table*
The cook had thought it a great matter, since there
was no ball, that there was the funeral luncheon
when they could be eaten, for she could not bear
waste. After the luncheon most of the people went
away; and it was but a small party which adjourned
into the room where Mr. Mount ford had spent
most of his life, to hear the will read, to which everybody
looked forward with excitement. Except
Heath cote and the Rector, and Mr. Loseby, there was
nobody present save the family. When Anne came,
following her stepmother and sister, who went first,
clinging together, she saw Charley Ashley in the
hall, and called to him as she passed. ' Come,' she
said softly, holding out her hand to him, ' I know
you will be anxious  come and hear how it is.' He
lOoked wistfully in her face, wondering if, perhaps.

she asked him because he was Cosmo's friend ; and
perhaps Anne understood what the look meant ; he
could not tell. She answered him quietly, gravely.
You are our faithful friend  you have been like
our brother. Come and hear how it is.' The Curate
followed her in very submissively, glad, yet almost
incapable of the effort. Should he have to sit still
and hear her put down out of her natural place ?
When they were all seated Mr. Loseby began, clearing
his throat :

Our late dear friend, mr. Montfort, made
several wills. There is the one of 1868 still inexistence
 it is not, I need scarcely say, the will I
am about to propound. It was made immediately
after his second marriage, and was chiefly in the
interests of his eldest daughter, then a child. The
will I am about to read is of a very different kind.
It is one, I am bound to say, against which I thought
it my duty to protest wannly. Words passed
between us then which were calculated to impair the
friendship which had existed between ]mr. Montfort
and myself all our lives. He was, however, magnanimous

us. He allowed me to say my say, and he did not
resent it. This makes it much less painful to me
than it might have been to appear here in a room so
associated with him, and make his will known to
you. I daresay this is all I need say, except that
after this will was executed, on the day indeed of
his death, Mr. Montfort gave to me in my office at
Hunston two sealed packets, one addressed to Miss
Montfort and the other to myself, with a clause inserted
on the envelope to the effect that neither was
to be opened till Miss Rose should have attained her
twenty-first birthday. I calculated accordingly that
they must have something to do with the will.
Having said this, I may proceed to read the will
itself.'

The first part of the document contained nothing
very remarkable. Many of the ordinary little bequests,
legacies to servants, one or two to public institutions,
and all that was to belong to his widow, were very
fully and clearly enumerated. The attention of the
little company was lulled as all this was read.
There was nothing wonderful in it after all. The

-commonplace is always comforting : it relieves the
strained attention far better than anything more
serious or elevated. An unconscious relief came to
the minds of all. But Mr. Loseby's voice grew
husky and excited when he came to what was the
last paragraph 

All the rest of my property of every kind, including
[and here there was an enumeration of

the unentailed landed property and money in various
investments, all described] I leave to my eldest

daughter, Anne Montfort .' Here the reader

made a little involuntary half-conscious pause of
excitement  and all the anxious people round him
testified the strain relieved, the wonder satisfied, and
yet a new rising of wonder and pleasant disappointment.
What did it mean ? why then had their
interest been thus raised, to be brought to nothing ?
Everything, then, was Anne's after all ! There was
a stir in which the next words would have been lost
altogether, but for a louder clearing of the voice on
the part of the reader, calling as it seemed for special
attention. He raised his hand evidently with the

same object. ' I leave,' he repeated, ' to my eldest
daughter, Anne Moimtford  in trust for her sister,

Eose '

Mrs. Montfort, who had been seated in a heap
in her chair, a mountain of crape, had roused up at
the first words. She raised herself up in her chair
forgetful of her mourning, not believing her ears ;
To Anne ! ' she said under her breath in strange
dismay. Had it meant nothing then ? Had all this
agitation both on her own part and on that of her
husband, who was gone, come to nothing, meant
nothing? She had suffered much, Mrs. Montfort
remembered now. She had been very unhappy;
feeling deeply the injustice which she supposed was
being done to Anne, even though she knew that
Rose was to get the advantage  but now, to think
that Rose had no advantage and Anne everything !
So many things can pass through the mind in a
single moment. She regretted her own regrets, her
remonstrances with him (which she exaggerated,,
the tears she had shed, and her compunctions about
Anne. All for nothing. What had he meant by

it? Tiy had he filled her vith such wild hopes
to be all brought to nothing ? The tears dried up
in a moment. She faced Mr. Loseby with a scared
pale face, resolving that, whatever happened, she
would contest this will, and declare it to be a
falsehood, a mistake. Then she, like all the others,
was stopped by the cough with which Mr. Loseby
recommenced, by the lifting of his finger. ' Ah ! '
she said unconsciously ; and then among all these
listening, wondering people, fell the other words like
thunderbolts out of the skies, ' in trust  for her

sister, Eose ' They sat and listened all in one

gasp of suspended breathing, of eagerness beyond the
power of description ; but no one took in the words
that followed. Anne was to have an income of five
hundred a year charged on the property till Rose
attained her twenty-first year. Nobody paid any
attention to this  nobody heard it even, so great
grew the commotion; they began to talk and
whisper among themselves before the reader had
stopped speaking. Anne to be set aside, and yet
employed, made into a kind of steward of her own

patrimony for her sister's benefit ; it was worse than
disinheritance, it was cruelty. The Rector turned
round to whisper to Heathcote, and Rose flung her
arms about her mother. The girl was bewildered.
What does it mean ? what does it mean ? ' she cried.
What is that about Anne  and me ? '

Mr. Loseby,' the Rector said, with a trembling
voice, ' this cannot be so : there must be some mistakes.
Our dear friend, whom we have buried to-day,
was a good man ; he was a just man. It is not
possible ; there must be some mistake.'

Mistake ! I drew it out myself,' Mr. Loseby said.
You will not find any mistake in it. There was a
mistake in his own mind. I don't say anything
against that ; but in the will there's no mistake.
I wish there was. I would drive a coach and
six through it if I could ; but it's all fast and
strong. Short of a miracle, nobody will break
that will  though I struggled against it. He was
as obstinate as a mule, as they all are  all the
Mountfords.'

Mr. Loseby,' said Mrs. Montfort, 'I did not

approve any more than you did. It was not any
doing of mine. I protested against it; bnt my
husband  my husband had his reasons.'

'There are no reasons that could justify this,*
said the tremulous old Eector ; ' it is a shame and a
sin ; it ought not to be. When a man's will is all
wrong, the survivors should agree to set it right.
It should not be left like that ; it will bring a curse
upon all who have anything to do with it,' said the
old man, who was so timid and so easily abashed. ' I
am not a lawyer. I don't know what the law will
permit ; but the Gospel does not permit such injustice
as this.'

Mr. Loseby had pushed his spectacles up on his
forehead and listened with an astonishment which
was tinctured first with awe, then with amusement.
The old Eector, feeblest of men and preachers ! The
lawyer gazed at him as at a curiosity of nature. It
was a fine thing in its way. But to attack a will of
his, John Loseby's ! He smiled at the folly, though
he sympathised with the courage. After all, the old
fellow had more in him than anybody thought.

Mrs. Montfort was roused too beyond her wont.
My husband had his reasons,' she said, her 'pale
face growing red ; ' he never did anything without
thought. I would not change what he had settled,
not for all the world, not for a kingdom. I interfere
to set a will aside ! and his will ! I don't think you
know what you are saying. No one could have such
a right.'

'Then it will bring a curse and no blessing,'
said the Rector, getting up tremulously. ' I have
nothing to do here; I said so at the first. Anne,
my dear excellent child, this is a terrible blow for
you. I wish I could take you out of it all. I wish
I wish that God had given me such a blessing as
you for my daughter, my dear.'

Anne rose up and gave him her hand. All the
usual decorums of such a meeting were made an
end of by the extraordinary character of the revelation
which had been made to them.

< Thank you, dear Mr. Ashley ; but never think
of me,' Anne said. ' I knew it would be so. And
papa, poor papa, had a right to do what he pleased.

"We spoke of it together often ; he never thought it
would come to this. How was he to think what was
to happen ? and so soon  so soon. I feel sure,' she
said, her eyes filling with tears, ' it was for this, and
not for pain, that he groaned after he fell.' 

He had need to groan,' said the Eector, shaking
his head  ' he had need to groan ! I hope it may
not be laid to his charge.' Mr. Ashley was too much
moved to recollect the ordinary politeness; he
pushed his chair away, back to the wall, not knowing
what he was doing. ' Come, Charley ! ' he said,
come, Charley ! I told you we had nothing to do
here. We cannot mend it, and why should we be in
the midst of it ? It is more than I can bear. Come,
Charley  unless you can be of use.'

But Mrs. Montfort felt it very hard that she
should thus be disapproved of by her clergyman.
It compromised her in every way. She began to cry,
settling down once more into the midst of her crape.
I don't know why you should turn against me,' she
said , ' Mr. Ashley. I had nothing to do with it. I
told him it would make me wretched if he punished

VOL. II. M

Anne ; but you cannot ask me to disapprove of my
husband, and go against my husband, and he only
to-day  only to-day '

Here she was choked by genuine tears. Eose
had kept close by her mother's side all the time.
She cried occasionally, but she gave her attention
closely to all that was going on, and the indignation
of the bystanders at her own preferment puzzled her
somewhat narrow understanding. Why should not
she be as good an heiress as Anne ? Why should
there be such a commotion about her substitution
for her sister ? She could not make out what they
meant. * I will always stand by you, mamma,' she
said, tremulously. ' Come upstairs. I do not suppose
we need stay any longer, Mr. Loseby ? There
is nothing for us to do.'

'Nothing at all. Miss Eose,' said the lawyer.
The men stood up while the ladies went away, Mrs.
Montfort leaning on her child's arm. Anne, too,
stood aside to let them pass. There was no reason
perhaps why they should have said anything to
her ; but she looked at them wistfully, and her lip

trembled a little. There were two of them, but of her
only one. One alone to face the world. She cast a
glance round upon the others who were all of her
faction, yet not one able to stand by her, to give her
any real support. Once more, two of them at least
felt that there was an appeal in her eyes  not to
them, nor to any one  a secret sense of the cruelty
of  what ?  circumstances, fate, which left her quite
alone at such a crisis. Then she, too, turned to the
lawyer. ' May I go too ? ' she said. ' No doubt
there will be a great deal for me to learn and to do ;
but I need not begin, need I, to-day ? '

My dear Miss Anne,' cried Mr. Loseby, ' I don't
know that you need to accept the trust at all. I
said to him I should be disposed to throw it into
Chancery, and to make your sister a ward of the
Coiu-t. I don't know that you need to accept it at
all '

Oh, yes,' she said, with a smile. ' I will accept
it. I will do it. My father knew very well that I
would do it ; but I need not begin, need I, today?'

Chapter XXI.

WHEN ALL WAS OVER.

The night dropped over Mount very darkly, as dark
a November night as ever fell, fog and damp heaviness
over everything outside, gloom and wonder and
bewilderment within. Mr. Loseby stayed all night
and dined with Jleathcote, to his great relief. Nobody
else came downstairs. Mrs. Montfort, though
she felt all the natural and proper grief for her great
loss, was not by any means unable to appear, and
Rose, who was naturally tired of her week's seclusion,
would have been very glad to do so ; but her mother
was of opinion that they ought not to be capable of
seeing anyone on the funeral day, and their meal
was brought up to their rooms as before. They
played a melancholy little game of bezique together

afterwards, which was the first symptom of returning
life which Mrs. Montfort had permitted hei-self to
be able for. Anne had joined them in Mrs. Mount-ford's
sitting-room, and had shared their dinner,
which still was composed of some of the delicacies
from the ball supper. In winter everything keeps
so long. There had been very Little conversation
between them there, for they did not know what to
say to each other. Mrs. Montfort, indeed, made a
Httle set speech, which she had conned over with
some care and solemnity. ' Anne,' she had said, ' it
would not become me to say a word against what
dear papa has done ; but I wish you to know that I
had no hand in it. I did not know what it was till
to-day : and, for that matter, I don't know now. I
was aware that he was displeased and meant to make
some change, and I entreated him not to do so.

That was aU I knew '

I am sure you had nothing to do with it,' Anne
said gently ; ' papa spoke to me himself. He had a
right to do as he pleased. I for one will not say
a word against it. I crossed him, and it was all

in his hands. I knew what the penalty was. I am
sure it has been a grief to you for some time
back.'

Indeed, you only do me justice, Anne,' cried her
stepmother, and a kiss was given and received ; but
perhaps it was scarcely possible that it should be a
very warm caress. After they had eaten together
Anne went back to her room, saying she had letters
to write, and Rose and her mother played that game
at bezique. It made the evening pass a little more
quickly than if they had been seated on either side
of the fire reading good books. And when the
bezique was over Mrs. Montfort went to bed.
There are many people who find in this a ready way
of getting through their superfluous time. Mrs.
Montfort did not mind how soon she went to bed ;
but this is not an amusement which commends itself
to youth. When her mother was settled for the
night, Rose, though she had promised to go too, felt
a little stirring of her existence within her roused,
perhaps, by the dissipation of the bezique. She
allowed that she was tired ; but still, after her

mother was tucked up for the night, she felt too restless
to go to bed. There could she go but to Anne's
room, which had been her refuge all her life, in every
trouble ? Anne was still writing letters, or at least
one letter, which looked like a book, there was so
much of it, Eose thought. She came behind her
sister, and would have looked over her shoulder, but
Anne closed her writing-book quickly upon the sheet
she was writing. ' Are you tired, dear ? * she said 
just, Eose reflected, like mamma,

'I am tired  of doing nothing, and of being
shut up. I hope mamma will let us come downstairs
tomorrow,' said Eose. Then she stole a
caressing arm round her sister's waist. ' I wish you
would tell me, Anne. What is it all about, and
what does it mean ? '

It is not so easy to tell. I did not obey
papa '

Are you sorry, Anne ? '

Sorry ? very sorry to have vexed him, dear. If
I had known he would be with us only such a little
time  but one never knows.'

I should have thought you would have been too
angry to be sorry '

Angry  when he is dead ? ' said Anne, with
quick rising tears. * Oh, no ! if he had been living
I might have been angry ; but now to think he cannot
change it, and perhaps would do anything to
change it '

Rose did not understand this. She said in a
little, petulant voice, ' Is it so dreadfully wrong sto
give it to me instead of you ? '

There is no question of you or me,' said Anne,
but of justice. It was my mother's. You are
made rich by what was hers, not his or anyone else's.
This is where the wrong lies. But don't let us talk
of it. I don't mean to say a word against it, Rose.'

Then Rose roamed about the room, and looked
at all the little familiar pictures and ornaments she
knew. The room was more cheerful than her
mother's room, with all its heavy hangings, in which
she had been living for a week. After a few minutes
she came back and leaned upon Anne's shoulder
again.

I wish you would tell me what it means
What is In Trust? Have you a great deal to do
with me ? ' she said.

Anne's face lighted up a little. ' I have everything
to do with you,' she said ; ' I am your guardian,
I think, I shall have to manage your money and
look after all your interests. Though I am poor
and you are rich, you will not be able to do anything
without me.'

But that will not last for ever,' said Rose, with
a return of the little, petulant tone.

No ; till you come of age. Didn't you hear today
what Mr. Loseby said ? and look, Rosie, though
it will break jowl heart, look here.'

Anne opened her desk and took out from an
inner drawer the sealed packet which Mr. Montfort
had himself taken to the lawyer on the day of his
death. The tears rose to her eyes as she took it out,
and Rose, though curiosity was so strong in her as
almost to quench emotion, felt something coming in
her throat at the first sight of her father's writing,
so familiar as it was. ' For my daughter Anne, not

to be opened till Rose's twenty-first birthday.' Rose
read it aloud, wondering. She felt something come
in her throat, but yet she was too curious, too full of
the novelty of her own position, to be touched as
Anne was. ' But that may change it all over again,'
she said.

'It is not likely ; he would not have settled
things one day and unsettled them the next ; especially
as nothing had happened in the meantime to
make him change again.'

Rose looked very curiously, anxiously, at the
letter. She took it in her hand and turned it over
and over. ' It must be about me, anyhow, I suppose
'

Yes,' said Anne, with a faint smile, * or me ;
perhaps he might think, after my work for you was
over, that I might want some advice.'

I suppose you will be married long before that ? '
:said Rose, still poising the letter in her hands.

I don't know  it is too early to talk of what is
going to be done. You are tired, Rosie  go to bed.'

Why should I be tired more than you ? You

have been doing a great deal, and I have been doing
nothing. That is like mamma's way of always
supposing one is tired, and wants to go to bed. I
hate bed. Anne, I suppose you will get married 
there can be nothing against it, now  only I don't
believe he has any money : and if you have no
money either '

Don't let us talk on the subject, dear  it is too
early, it hurts me  and I want to finish my letter.
Sit down by the fire  there is a very comfortable
chair, and a book  if you don't want to go to bed.'

Are you writing to ]Mr. Douglas, Anne ? '

Anne answered only with a slight nod of her
head. She had taken her pen into her hand. She
could not be harsh to her little sister this day above
all others, in which her little sister had been made
the means of doing her so much harm  but it cost
her an effort to be patient. Rose, for her part, had
no science to gain information from the inflections
of a voice. ' Why wasn't he here to-day ? ' was the
next thing she said.

Eosie, dear, do you know I have a great deal todo

? Don't ask me so many questions,' Anne said
piteously. But Rose was more occupied by her own
thoughts than by anything her sister said.

He ought to have been at the funeral,' she said,,
with that calm which was always so astonishing ta
her sister. ' I thought when you went to the grave
you must have known you were to meet him there*
Mamma thought so, too.'

These words sank like stones into Anne's heart ;
but there was a kind of painful smile on her face.
You thought I was thinking of meeting anyone
.there ? Oh, Rose, did you think me so cold-hearted ?
I was thinking only of him who was to be laid there.'

I don't mean that you are cold-hearted. Of
course we were all wretched enough. Mamma said
it would have been too much either for her or me ;.
but you were always the strongest, and then of
course we expected Mr. Douglas would be there.'

You do not know him,' cried Anne, with a little
vehemence ; ' you do not know the delicacy, the feeling
he has. How was he to come intruding himself
the moment that my father was gone  thrusting.

himself even into his presence, after being forbidden.
A man of no feeling might have done it, but

he . Eosie, please go away. I cannot talk to

you any more.'

Oh, was that how it was ? ' Eose was silenced
for the moment. She went away to the seat by the
fire which her sister had pointed out to her. Anne
had not noticed that she had still the letter in her
hands. And then she was quiet for some time, while
her sister resumed her writing. Cosmo's conduct
soon went out of Eose's head, while she occupied
herself with the other more important matter which
concerned herself. What might be in this letter of
papa's ? Probably some new change, some new will,
something quite different. ' If I am not to be the
heiress after all, only have the name of it for three
years, what will be the use ? ' Eose said to herself.
She was very sensible in her limited way. ' I would
rather not have any deception or have the name of
it, if it is going to be taken away from me just when
I should want to have it.' She looked at the seals
of the packet with longing eyes. If they would only

melt  if they would but break of themselves. ' I
wonder why we shouldn't read it now ? ' she said. ' It
is not as if we were other people, as if we were
strangers  we are his own daughters, his two only
children  he could not have meant to hide anything
from us. If you will open and read it, and tell
me what it is, we need not tell anyone  we need not
even tell mamma.'

What are you talking of, Rose ? '

I am talking of papa's letter, of course. Why
should you keep it, not knowing what harm it maybe

going to do Anne ! you hurt me  you hurt

me ! ' Rose cried.

Anne sprang to her feet with the natural impetuosity
which she tried so hard to keep under,
and seized the letter out of her sister's hands.

You must never speak nor think of anything of
the kind,' she cried ; ' my father's wish, his last
charge to us '

I am sure,' said Rose, beginning to cry, ' you
need not speak  it is you that refused to do what he
told you, not I ? This is quite innocent ; what could

it matter ? It can't vex him now, whatever we do,
for he will never know. I would not have disobeyed
him when he was living  that is, not in
anything serious, not for the world  but now, what
can it matter, when he will never, never know ? '

The utter scepticism and cynicism of the little
childish creature, crying by the fire, did not strike
Anne. It was only a naughtiness, a foolishness upon
the child's part, nothing more. She restored the
packet to the private drawer and locked it with
energy, closing down and locking the desk, too. It
was herself she blamed for having shown the packet,
not Rose, who knew no better. But now it was clear
that she must do, what indeed she generally had todo,
when Rose claimed her attention  give up her
own occupation, and devote herself to her sister. She
came and sat down by her, leaving the letter in which
her heart was. And Rose, taking advantage of the
opportunity, tormented her with questions. When
at last she consented to retire to her room, Anne
could do nothing but sit by the fire, making a vain
attempt to stifle the more serious questions, which

were arising, whether she would or no, in her own
heart. 'Rose = prose,' she had tried hard to say to
herself, as so often before ; but her lips quivered, so
that a smile was impossible. She sat there for a
long time after, trying to recover herself. She had
arrived at a crisis of which she felt the pain without
understanding the gravity of it. And indeed the
sudden chaos of confusion and wonder into which she
had wandered, she could not tell how, had no doubt
so deadened the blow of the strange will to her, as to
give her a heroism which was half stupidity, as so
many heroism are. She, too, had expected, like all
the world, that Cosmo would have come to her at
once  if not to Mount, yet to the rectory, where his
friends would have received him. She had taken it
for granted  though she had not said a word on the
subject to anyone, nor even to herself, feeling that
to see him and feel him near her would be all the
greater consolation if she had never said she looked
for it, even in her own heart. She had not given
his name to Charley Ashley as one of those to be
informed by telegraph, nor had she mentioned his

name at all, though she seemed to herself to read it
in a continual question in the Curate's eyes. A chill
had stolen over her when she heard nothing of him all
the first long day. She had not permitted herself to
ask or to think, but she had started at every opening
door, and listened to every step outside, and even,
with a pang which she would not acknowledge, had
looked out through a crevice of the closed shutters,
with an ache of wondering anguish in her heart, to
see the Curate coming up the avenue alone on the
second morning. But when Cosmo's letter came to
her, by the ordinary return of post, Anne tried to say
to herself that of course he was right and she was
wrong  nay more than that  that she had known
exactly all through which was the more delicate and
noble way, and that it was this. How could he come
to Mount, he who had been turned away from it
(though this was not quite true), who had been the
cause of her disinheritance ? How could he present
himself the moment the father, who had objected to
him so strenuously, was dead ? Cosmo laid the
whole case before her with what seemed the noblest

VOL. II. N

frankness, in that letter. ' I am in your hands,' he
said. * The faintest expression of a wish from you
will change everything. Say to me, " Come," and I
will come, how gladly I need not say  but without
that word, how can I intrude into the midst of a
grief which, believe me, my dearest, I shall share,
for it will be yours, but which by all the rest of the
world will seem nothing but a deliverance and relief
to me.' Anne, who had not allowed herself to say a
word, even to her own soul, of the sickening of
disappointment and wonder in her, who had stood
bravely dumb and refused to be conscious that she
had expected him, felt her heart leap up with a
visionary triumph of approval, when this letter came.
Oh, how completely and nobly right he was ! How
superior in his instinctive sense of what it was most
delicately honourable and fit to do, in such an
emergency, to any other, or to herself even, who
ought to have known better.

She wrote instantly to say, ' You are right, dear
Cosmo. You are more than right ; how could anyone
be so blind as not to see that this is what you

ought to, what you must have done, and that
nothing else was possible ? ' And since then she had
said these words over to herself again and again
and had gone about all her occupations more
proudly, more erect and self-sustaining, because of
this evident impossibility that he should have been
there, which the heavier people about, without
his fine perceptions and understanding, did not
seem to see. As a matter of fact, she said to herself,
she wanted no help. She was not delicate or very
young, like Rose, but a full-grown woman, able for
anything, worthy of the confidence that had been
placed in her. Nevertheless, there had been a
moment, when Heathcote had put out his arm to
support her at the side of the grave, when the sense
of Cosmo's absence had been almost more than she
could bear, and his excuse had not seemed so
sufficient as before. She had rejected the proffered
support. She had walked firmly away, proving to all
beholders that she was able to do all that she had
to do, and to bear all that she had to bear ; but
nevertheless the pang and chill of this moment had

N 2

shaken Anne's moral being. She had read in
Heathcote's eyes some reflection of the indignant
question, 'Where is that fellow?' She had discerned
it in Charley Ashley's every look and gesture
and there had been a dull anticipation and echo
of their sentiments in her heart. She had, as it
were, struck against it, and her strength and [her
nerves were shaken by the encounter. The after
thrill of this, still going through and through her,
had made her almost indifferent to the shock given
by the reading of the will. She had not cared the
least about that. She had been dulled to it, and
was past feeling it  though it was not in the least
what she had expected, and had so much novelty
and individuality of vengeance in it as to have given
a special blow had she been able to receive it. Even
now when her intelligence had fully taken it in, her
heart was still untouched by it  Un chiodo caccia
un' alto. But she had slowly got the better of the
former shock. She had re-read Cosmo's letters, of
which she received one every day, and had again
come to see that his conduct was actuated by the

I

very noblest motives. Then had come Eose's visit
and all those questionings, and once more Anne had
felt as if she had run against some one in the dark,
sand had been shaken by the shock. She sat trying
to recover herself, trembling and incapable for a longtime,
before she could go and finish her letter. And
yet there was much in that letter that she was
anxious Cosmo should know.

While all this was going on upstairs, the two
gentlemen were sitting over their dinner, with still
a little excitement, a little gloom hovering over
them, but on the whole comfortable, returning to
their usual ways of thinking and usual calm of mind.
Even to those most intimately concerned, death is
one of the things to which the human mind most
easily accustoms itself. Mr. Loseby was more new
than Heathcote was to the aspect of the house, from
which for the time all its usual inhabitants and
appearances had gone. He said ' Poor Montfort !
two or three times . in the course of dinner, and
stopped to give an account of the claret on which
the late master of the house had much prided himself.

'And very good it is,' Mr. Loseby said. 'I
suppose, unless the widow reserves it for her own
use  and I don't believe she knows it from Gladstone
claret at 12s. a dozen  there will be a sale.'
This intruded a subject which was even more interesting
than the will and all that must flow from
it. * What do you intend to do ? '

Now Heathcote Montfort was not very happy
any more than the other members of the household.
He had gone through a disappointment too. Heath-cote
had but one person in the world who had been
of any importance in his past life, and that was his
young brother Edward, now at Sandhurst. It had
been settled that Edward and a number of his
comrades should come to Mount for the dance, but
when Heathcote had signified his wish, after all this
was over, that Edward should come for the funeral,
the young man had refused. ' Why should I ?
You will all be as dull as ditch-water ; and I never
knew our kinsman as you call him. You are dismal
by nature, Heathcote, old boy,' the young man had
said, ' but not I  why should I come to be another

mute ? Can't you find enough without me ? ' Edward,
who was very easily moved when his own concerns
were in question, was as obstinate as the rest of the
Mountfords as to affairs which did not concern himself.
He paid no attention to his brother's plea fora
little personal consolation. And Heathcote, who
regarded the young fellow as a father regards his
spoiled child, was disappointed. To be sure, he
represented to himself, Edward too had been disappointed
; he had lost his ball, which was a thing
of importance to him, and the settlement of his
affairs, for which he had been looking with such
confidence, was now indefinitely postponed. Edward
had not been an easy boy to manage ; he had not
been a very good boy. He had been delicate and
wayward and spoiled  spoiled as much by the elder
brother who was thoroughly aware how wrong it was,
as by the mother who had been foolish about
Edward, and had died when he was still so young
that spoiling did not matter much. Heathcote had
carried the process on ; he had vowed to himself
that, so far as was possible, the delicate boy should

not miss his mother's tenderness ; and he had kept
his word, and ruined the boy. Edward had got
everything he wanted from his brother, so long as he
wanted only innocent things ; and afterward he had
got for himself, and insisted on getting, things that
were not so innocent ; and the result was that,
though still only twenty, he was deeply in debt. It
was for this that Heathcote had made up his mind
to sacrifice the succession to Mount. Sacrifice  it
was not a sacrifice ; he cared nothing for Mount,
and Edward cared less than nothing. Even afterwards,
when he had begun to look upon Mount with
other eyes, he had persevered in his intention to
sacrifice it ; but now all that had come to an end.
Whether he would or not, Heathcote Montfort had
become the possessor of Mount, and Edward's debts
were very far from being paid. In these circumstances
Heathcote felt it specially hard upon him
that his brother did not come to him, to be with
him during this crisis. It was natural ; he did not
blame Edward ; and yet he felt it almost as a woman
might have felt it. This threw a gloom over him

almost more than the legitimate gloom, which, to be
sm-e, Heathcote by this time had recovered from.
It was not in nature that he could have felt it very
deeply after the first shock. His own vexations
poured back upon his mind, when mr. Loseby said,
 What do you intend to do ? '

You will say what have I to do with that ? ' the
sold lawyer said. ' And yet, if you will think, I have
to do with it more or less. We have to get the
family out on our side. It's early days  but if you
should wish an early settlement '

I don't mind if it is never settled,' said Heath-cote
; ' what should I do with this great place ? It
would take all my income to keep it up. If they
like to stay, they are very welcome. I care nothing
about it. Poor St. John had a handsome income
from other sources. He was able to keep it up.'

Grood Lord, Mr. Heathcote,' said the lawyer, 'why
didn't you come a year ago ? A young man should
not neglect his relations ; it always turns out badly.
If you had come here a year ago, in the natural
course of events, I could have laid a thousand pounds

upon it that you and Anne would have taken a fancy
each other. You seem to me exactly cut out for
each other  the same ways, a little resemblance
even in looks '

You pay me too great a compliment,' said
Heathcote, with an uneasy laugh, colouring in spite
of himself; 'and you must let me say that my
cousin's name is sacred, and that, old friend as you
are, you ought not to discuss her so.'

I  oughtn't to talk of Anne ? Why, she has
sat upon my knee,' said Mr. Loseby. ' Ah ! why
didn't you come a year ago ? I don't say now that
if it was to your mind to make yourself comfortable
as poor Montfort did, in the same way, there's still
the occasion handy. No, I can't say that,' said the
old lawyer, ' I am too sick of the whole concern*
Anne treated like that, and Rose, little Rose,

that bit of a girl ! However,' he said, recovering

himself, ' I ought to remember that after all you
can't take the same interest in them as I do, and
that we were talking of your own concerns.'

I take a great interest in my cousins,' said

Heathcote gravely. ' Do you know I believe poor St,
John meant to buy my interest, to accept my proposal,
and leave Mount to his eldest daughter.'

Xo ; you don't think so ? Well, that might
have been a way out of it  that might have been a
way out of it  now that you recall it to me the
same thought struck myself; at least I thought
he would take advantage of that to make a
new settlement, after he had taken his fling and
relieved his mind with this one. Ah, poor man, he
never calculated on the uncertainty of life  he never
thought of that rabbit-hole. Grod help us, what a
thing life is ! at the mercy of any rolling stone, and
any falling branch, of a poor little rabbit's burrowing,
or even a glass of water. And what a thing is man !
as Hamlet says ; it's enough to make anyone moralise :
but we never take a bit of warning by it  never a
bit. And so you really think he meant to take
Mount off your hands and settle it on Anne? I
don't think he had gone so far as that  but I'll tell
you what we'll do, we'll tell her so, and that will
make her happy. She's not Like other people, she

is all wrong here,' said Mr. Loseby, laughing, with
the tears in his eyes, and tapping his forehead.
She has a bee in her bonnet, as the Scotch say.
She is a fool, that is what Anne is  she will be as
pleased as if he had left her a kingdom. The worst
thing of it all to that girl is, that her father has
naade himself look like a tyrant and a knave  which
he wasn't, you know  he wasn't, poor Montfort !
though he has done his best to make himself appear
so. Once give her something to build up his
character again upon, some ground, it doesn't matter
how fanciful it is, and she'll be happy. She won't
mind her own loss, bless you,' said the old lawyer,
half crying, ' she is such a fool ! '

Mr. Loseby,' said Heathcote with an emotion
which surprised him, ' I think you are giving my
cousin Anne the most beautiful character that ever
was.'

Sir,' cried Mr. Loseby, not ashamed to dry his
eyes, ' whoever said anything different ? Did you
ever hear anything different? As long as I have
known the world I have never known but one Anne

Montfort. Oh, Mr. Heathcote, Mr. Heathcgte,' he
added, his voice turning into tremulous laughter,
what a thousand pities that you did not make your
appearance a year before ! '

Heathcote got up from his chair with a start, and
walked about the room in a nervous impatience, for
which he could give no reason to himself. Was it
that he, too, wished he had come to Mount a year
sooner ? He left the old man to finish his wine, and
roamed about, now pausing a moment with his back
to the fire, now extending his walk into the dark
corners. He had lit his cigarette, which furnished
him with an excuse  but he was not thinking of his
cigarette. What he was thinking was  What the
devil did that fellow mean by staying away now ?
Whj didn't he come and stand by her like a man ?
What sort of a pitiful cur was he that he didn't come,
now he was free to do it, and stand by her like a
man ? He disposed of Charley Ashley's mild plea
with still greater impatience. Perhaps she had forbidden
him to come. ' Would I have been kept away
by any forbidding ? ' Heathcote said to himself

without knowing it. Then he came back from the
corners in which such suggestions lay, feeling uneasy,
feeling wroth and uncomfortable, and took his stand
again before the fire. ' Perhaps you will give me a
little advice about the money I wanted,' he said to
Mr. Loseby. This was safer on the whole than
suffering himself to stray into foolish fancies as to
what he would have done, or would not have done,
supposing an impossible case  supposing he had
made his appearance a year sooner ; before there was
-any complication of any unsatisfactory ' fellow ' with
the image of his cousin Anne.

CHAPTER XXII.

SOPHISTRY.

It is not to be supposed that the events which
had moved so deeply the household at Mount, and
all its connections, should have passed lightly over
the one other person who, of all to whom the Mountfords
were familiar, could alone feel himself a principal
in the important matters involved. Douglas
had looked on from a distance, keeping himself out
of all the immediate complications, but not the less
had he looked on with a beating heart, more anxious
than it is possible to say, and, though still quiescent,
never less than on the verge of personal action, and
never clear that it would not have been wisest for
him to plunge into the midst of it from the first.
His position had not been easy, nor his mind composed,
from the beginning. Wien he had heard of

Mr. Montfort's death his agitation was great. He
had not become indifferent to Anne. The thought
that she was in trouble, and he not near her, was no
pleasant thought. All the first evening, after he
had received Charley Ashley's telegram, he had spent
in a prolonged argument with himself. He knew
from Anne that something had been done, though
he did not know what; that, according to her
father's own words, the property had been taken
from her and given to her sister. She had told him
what her father said, that it was understood between
them that this transfer was to be made, and that
she had no longer any interest in the fortune which
had once been so certainly considered hers. Cosmo
had not admired the ease with which she spoke on
this question. He had gnashed his teeth at Anne's
unworldliness, at her calm consent to her father's
arrangements, and ready making up of the quarrel
with him. She was his love, his dearest, in all truth
the one woman in the world who had captivated his
affections, and made him feel that he had no longer
any choice, any preference, that did not point to

her ; but he had acted like a fool all the same, he
thought. In some minds, perhaps in most minds,
this conviction can exist without in the least
affecting the reality of the love which lies behind.
He loved Anne, but his love did not make him
think that everything she did was well done.
She had behaved like a fool. Old Mr. Loseby said
the same thing, but he said it with glistening
eyes, and with an appreciation of the folly and
its character such as Cosmo ' was altogether incapable
of.

Nevertheless, Anne's lover did not feel his love
materially lessened by this conviction. He gnashed
his teeth at it, thinking, ' Had I but been there I '
though he knew very well that, had he been there,
he could have done nothing to change it. But one
thing he could do : when she was his wife he could
put a stop to such follies. There should be none of
this ridiculous magnanimity, this still more ridiculous
indifference, then. In writing to her he had
felt that it was difficult to keep all vestige of his
disapproval out of his letters, but he had managed

VOL. II. o

pretty nearly to do so ; feeling wisely that it was
useless to preach to her on such a subject, that only
his own constant guidance and example, or, better
still, his personal conduct of her affairs, could bring
real good sense into them. He had been anxious
enough while this was going on, not seeing what
was to come, feeling only certain that, love as he
might, he could no more marry his love without a
penny than he could make himself Lord Chief
Justice. It was out of the question : in his position
marriage was difficult in the best of circumstances ;
but to marry a wife without a fortune of her own,
without enough to keep her comfortable, was simply
folly not to be thought of. Anne's dreams of
romantic toil, of the enthusiasm of hard work into
which a man might rush for the sake of a woman he
loved, and of the heroic life the two could lead,
helping each other on to fame and fortune at the
end, were to him as silly as a nursery tale. Men
who made their own way like that, overcoming every
obstacle, and fo: 'ng their way to the heights of
ambition, were men who did it by temperament, not

by love, or for any sentimental motive. Cosmo
knew that he was not the sort of man to venture on
such a madness. His wife must have enough to
provide for her own comfort, to keep her as she had
been accustomed to be kept, or else he could have
no wife at all.

This had given him enough to think of from
the very beginning of the engagement, as has been
already shown. His part was harder than Anne's,
for she had fanciful ups and dovns as was natural to
her, and if she sometimes was depressed would be
next moment up in the clouds, exulting in some
visionary blessedness, dreaming out some love in a
cottage or still more ludicrous love in chambers,
which his sterner reason never allowed to be possible,
not for an hour ; therefore his was the hardest
burden of the two. For he was not content to part
with her, nor so much as to think of parting with
her ; and yet, with all his ingenuity, he could not
see how, if her father did not relent, it could be
done. And the worst thing now was that the father

o 2

was beyond all power of relenting  that he was dead,
absolutely dead, allowed to depart out of this world
having done his worst. Not one of the family, not
one of Mr. Montfort's dependents, was more
stunned by the news than Cosmo. Dead! he read
over the telegram again and again  he could not
believe his eyes  it seemed impossible that such a
piece of wickedness could have been accomplished ;
he felt indignant and furious at everybody concerned,
at Mr. Montfort for dying, at Grod for permitting
it. A man who had made such a mistake, and to
whom it was absolutely indispensable that he should
be allowed time to repent of his mistake and amend
it and instead of this he had died  he had been
permitted to die.

The news threw Cosmo into a commotion of
mind which it is impossible to describe. At one
period of the evening he had thrown some things
into a bag, ready to start, as Ashley expected him todo
; then he took another thought. If he identified
himself with everything that was being done now,
how could he ever withdraw after, how postpone

ulterior proceedings? This, however, is a brutal
way of stating even the very first objection that
occurred to Cosmo. Sophistry would be a poor art
if it only gave an over-favourable view of a man's
actions and motives to the outside world and left
himself unconvinced and undeceived. His was of a
much superior kind. It did a great deal more for
him. \\nien its underground industry was once in
full action it bewildered himself. It was when he
was actually closing his bag, actually counting out
the contents of his purse to see if he had enough for
the journey, that this other line of reasoning struck
him. If he thus rushed to Mount to take his place
by Anne's side, and yet was not prepared (and he
knew he was not prepared) to urge, nay, almost
force himself upon Anne's immediate acceptance asher
husband, would he not be doing a wrong to
Anne ? He would compromise her ; he would beholding
her up to the world as the betrothed of a
poor man, a man not so well off as to be able to
claim her, yet holding her bound. He paused,
really feeling this to throw a new light upon the

subject. Would it be acting honourably by Anne ?
Would it, in her interest, be the right thing todo?


This, however, was not all or half the mental
process he had to go through. He paused for her
sake ; yet not in this way could the reason of his
hesitation be made clear to her. She would not
mind being ' compromised.' She would not insist
upon the fulfilment of their engagement. He had
to think of some other reason to prove to her that it
was better he should stay away. He made out his
case for her, gradually, at more cost of thought than
the plea which had convinced himself; but at the
end it satisfied him as full of very cogent and effective
reasoning. The whole matter opened up before
him as he pondered it. He began to ask himself, to
ask her, how he could, as a man of honour, hurry to
Mount as soon as the breath was out of the body of
the master of the house who had rejected and sent
him away ? How could he thrust himself into Mr.
Montfort's presence as soon as he was dead and incapable
of resenting it  he, who when living would

have refused to admit him, would have had nothing
to say to him? He put back his money into his
purse, and slowly undid his bag and threw out his
linen as these thoughts arose and shaped themselves
in his mind. In either point of view it would be
impossible to do it ; in either point of view manly
self-denial, honour, and consideration for all parties
required that in this emergency he should not think
of what was pleasant either to her or himself. It
was a crisis too important for the mere action of
instinctive feelings. Of course he would like to be
with her  of course she would like to have him by
her. But here was something more than what they
would like, a world of things to be considered. To
say that Cosmo, deep down at the bottom of his
heart, was not aware that there might be another
larger, simpler mode of considering the question
which would sweep all these intellectual cobwebs
away and carry him off in a moment to Anne's
side, to stand by her in defiance of all prudential
motives, would be untrue. It is the curse of sophistry
that this sense of something better, this consciousness

of a fundamental flaw in its arguments, is
seldom quite obliterated ; but at the same time it
was far more in accordance with his nature to act
according to the more elaborate, and not according
to the simpler system. He satisfied himself, if not
completely, yet sufficiently to reconcile himself to
what he was doing ; and he satisfied Anne so far at
least as her first response, her first apprehension was
concerned. ' Dear Cosmo, you are right, you are
right, you are more than right, as you always are,'
she had said with a kind of enthusiasm, in her first
letter. ' They say that women have more delicate
perceptions, but that only shows how little people
know. I see in a moment the truth and the wisdom
and the fine honour of what you say. I am capable
of understanding it at least, but I feel how far you
go beyond me in delicacy of feeling as well as in
other things. No, no ! you must not come ; respect
for my dear father forbids it, although I cannot but
hope and feel certain that my father himself knows
better now.' This had been her first reply to hi
explanation ; and he had been satisfied then that

what he had done, and the reasons he had given
were in all senses the best.

It was now, however, the day after Mr. Mount-ford's
funeral, and everything had progressed beyond
that event. Till it is over, the dead is still the first
person to be considered, and all things refer to him
as to one who is the centre of every thought. But
when the earth has closed over his head then an
inevitable change occurs. He is left there where he
lies  be he the most important, the most cherished
and beloved  and other interests push in and take
the first place. Cosmo sat in his chambers on the
evening of that day, and read his letters with a
distinct consciousness of this difference, though he
himself had taken no immediate share in the excitements
of the dying and the burial. There was a
long, very long letter from Anne, and a shorter one
from Charley Ashley, which he read first with a
slight sensation of alarm, notwithstanding his anxiety
to hear about the will ; for Cosmo could not but feel,
although he was satisfied himself with the reasons
for his conduct, and though Anne was satisfied, that

such a rude simpleton as the curate might possibly
take a different view. He held Anne's letter in his
hand while he read the other. Charley was very
brief. He was not much of a correspondent in any
case.

We got over the funeral well on the whole,'
Charley wrote. ' The others only went to the
church, but she followed her father to the grave as
you would expect. At one moment I thought she
would break down ; and then I confess that I felt,
in your place, scarcely her own express command
could have made up to me for being absent at such
a time. The reading of the will was still more trying,
if possible  at least I should have thought so.
But she behaved like  herself  I can't say anything
more. I thought you would like to have a separate
account, as, no doubt, she will make as light of all
she has to go through as possible. Only on this
point you ought not altogether to take her own
word. She has acknowledged that she will have a
great deal to bear. She wants support, whatever
she may say.'

A slight smile went over Cosmo's face as he put
down this note. It was not a very comfortable smile.
A man does not like even an imaginary tone of contempt
in another man's voice. And Charley Ashley
was his own retainer, his dog, so to speak. To be
judged by him was a novel and not a pleasant sensation.
A year ago Cosmo could have felt certain
that Charley would find everything he did right;
he would have believed in his friend's inscrutable
motives, even if he could not understand them. But
now there was a change. It was not only the hopeless
rivalry which Charley himself felt to be hopeless,
and which had never stood for a moment in Cosmo's
way, but it was the instinct of true affection in the
good fellow's heart which made a severe critic, a
judge incorruptible, of Charley. Douglas did not
think very much of Charley's opinion or approval ;
but to feel it withdrawn from him, to detect a doubt,
and even suspicion in his faithful adherent's words,
gave him a sting. Then he read the long letter in
which Anne had poured forth all her heart ; there
were revelations in it also. It had been interrupted

by Eose's matter-of-fact questions. Darts of vulgar
misapprehension, of commonplace incapacity to
understand those fine motives of Cosmo's which to
herself were so eloquent, had come across the current
of her words. Anne had not been aware of the
risings and fallings of sentiment with which she
wrote. She had known that by turns her heart in
her bosom felt, as she had herself described it, ' like
lead.' She had been aware that now and then there
had seemed no sort of comfort nor lightening of the
sky wherever she looked, even when she looked to
him, and endeavoured to think of that *' falling back
upon' him to support her, which had seemed the
happiest image of their mutual relations a few days
ago. But she had not been aware of the breaks in
her letter, following these fluctuations of sentiment,
of how she had flagged and shown her discouragement,
and sometimes permitted to be audible a
breathing, not of complaint, not of reproach, but of
something which was neither, yet included both  a
sort of sigh of loneliness.

My heart almost failed me when all was over,*

she wrote ; ' I think I must have shown it in my
looks, for our cousin, Heathcote Montfort, held out
his arm to me. It was not his arm I wanted, Cosmo,
you know. Oh, how strange and how sad it is that
just when we want support most, hard life has so
altered everything that we cannot have it ! ' And
then, again, after giving him the fullest details of
the will : ' I told you before that the thought of
being set aside  of being second where I had always
been first  was more hard to me than I could have
believed possible ; and you, who are always ready to
think the best of me, said that it was natural, that
I could not have been expected to feel otherwise. I
must tell you now, however, in my own defence,
that I did not feel at all like this to-day ; I never
imagined, though I have thought so often on the
subject, that it would have been possible to set me
aside so completely as has been done. You understand
that I have nothing (except what came to me
from old Uncle Ben), nothing  except indeed a
sort of allowance Hke a schoolmistress for taking
care of Rose, which will only last three years.

But, Cosmo, if you will believe me, I never thought
of it ; my heart did not sink in the least. I did not
seem to care that it had all gone away from me, or
that Eose had been set in my place, or that my
father  (poor papa  how he must have felt it at the
last !) should have been so unjust. They were all
made of no account, as if they were the most trifling
things in the world by  something else. I owe
that to you too : and you must understand, dear
Cosmo, you must understand that I feel you must
have thought of this, and more or less done it on purpose,
for my sake. I cared nothing, nothing, for all
the loss and downfall, because there just gleamed
upon me a possibility  no, not a possibility  a fancy,
an imagination, of how different it would be if I
had to face not the loss of fortune, but the loss of
love, and companionship, and support. I cried out
to myself. What would it all matter in comparison
with that ? Thank Grod that it is money that has
been taken from me, not that. Feeling myself just
for that moment, and for good reason, alone, made
me realise to the very bottom of my heart what it

would be to be really alone  to have no one to fall
back upon, no Cosmo, no world of my own where I
can enter in and be above all the world. So you see
this little bitter has been sweet, it has been medicine
for all my other weaknesses. Through this I rose
altogether superior to everything that was sordid.
I was astonished at myself. Making believe not to
care and not caring are two different things, and
this time I attained real indifference, thanks to
you.'

This was the passage that affected him most ;
there were others in which there were slighter references
of the same kind, showing that Anne had
already tasted the forlorn consciousness of what it
was to be alone. It was not a complaint, as will be
seen ; it was indeed quite the opposite of a complaint
; but it gave Cosmo a chill of alarm, a sensation
which it would be very difficult to describe.
Nor was it a threat on Anne's part  yet he was
alarmed ; he grew pale and chilly in spite of himself.
When he read Anne's letter he took up Charley's
again, and ran over that. If he did not want to

marry on nothing, and have a family to provide for
before he had enough for himself, still less did he
wish anyone to regard him as the hero of a broken
engagement, a domestic traitor. He was not bad
nor treacherous, nor had he any pleasure in the
possibility of breaking a heart. What he wanted
was, first, to find in the woman he loved ' a lady
richly left ' like Portia, bringing with her all the
natural provisions for a beautiful home which she
would grace and give charm to ; second, if the first
should not prove possible, patience to wait, and
make no fuss, and see what would turn up. But to
be supposed to have behaved badly to a lady, to beset
down as drawing back, or holding off, or any of
the mild phrases which imply desertion, was terrible
to him. This Cosmo could not bear. He did not
want to lose or even to risk Anne. And to have her
think badly of him, lose the respect, not to say the
love, which she felt for him, was a danger that made
the hair stand upright on his head. He did not wish
even to lose Charley Ashley's regard, and become a
mean and discredited person in the curate's eyes :

how much more in Anne's, whom he loved ! A panic
took possession of Cosmo. A dishonourable lover,
a betrayer, was as much an anachronism as a cruel
father; it was a thing out of date. Men of his
stamp broke no vows. They might be disinclined
to heroic measures generally, and above all to the
uncomfortable heroism of dragging down a woman
into poverty, taking advantage of her inexperience,
and marrying in the face of every suggestion of prudence.
But to desert her because she had lost her
fortune, to cry off as soon as it became evident that
she was no longer a good match  this, whatever the
vulgar imagination may think, is what a young man
on his promotion, like Cosmo Douglas, could not
venture to do. He was horrified by the very notion.
In all questions of marriage there is of course a
possibility that it may all come to nothing, that
circumstances may arise '  that incompatibilities
may be discovered  even that a mutual sense of
what is prudent may cause an absolute breach. Such
things are to be heard of every day in society. But
for a man, especially one who is a nobody, to * behave

YOL. II. p

badly ' to a lady that is what cannot be. If the
mere suggestion of such a thing got out, it would be
unendurable. And Cosmo knew that everybody was
ready to report every rumour, to put on record every
incident of such a story. At the same time, the
great crisis being over, there need be no longer, he
said to himself, any idea of compromising Anne.
Perhaps the ground on which he framed his new
resolution was less solid than that on which he had
framed the last. But, according to his new light,
the emergency was pressing, and there was no time
to lose.

That evening accordingly, the linen which had
been put back into his drawers was replaced in the
bag, and the contents of his purse investigated.
He sent a telegram to Charley Ashley, which filled
that good fellow with excitement, compunction, and
perhaps a touch of disappointment, and left London
by the night train. It brought him to the Kectory
uncomfortably early ; but still there was no other so
convenient which entailed so little loss of time, and
Cosmo felt the advantage of making it apparent that

he had come hurriedly and had little time to spare.
He arrived while it was still dark on the wintry,
foggy, chill morning. Could any man do more to
show the fervent reality of his passion? He had
stayed away as long as Anne was filling a kind of
official position, so long as she was the object of
general observation. Now, when she had no longer
any sort of artificial claim upon her, or necessity
for exerting herself, here he was at her command.

CHAPTER XXIII.

heath cote's proposal.

It was a new world upon which Anne rose that day.
The excitement was over, the gloomy details of
business drawing to completion, and the new circumstances
of the family life remained to be settled by
the family themselves. It was still early when Anne
came downstairs, and took her way to the library in
which Mr. Loseby was sitting. He was at her father's
table, almost in the same spot where Mr. Montfort,
for as long as she could remember, had done his
business, or made believe to do it. This startled hera
little ; but it was time to resist these overwhelming
associations, and address herself, she felt, to the
business in hand. She came up to him quickly,
giving herself no time to think. 'Mr. Loseby,

jOTi must instruct me what are my duties,' she
said.

Heathcote Montfort was at the other end of the
room, idly looking through the books, and she had
not seen him, but he was unconscious of this. By
degrees he had come to know all about Anne, to feel
a difference in the atmosphere when she came in, to
see her whenever she appeared as if with eyes in the
back of his head.

Your duties, my dear child ? ' Ii'. Loseby said,
pushing up his spectacles on his forehead. ' Sit down
there in front of me and let us talk. It does one
good to look at you, Anne.'

You were always very kind,' she said gratefully.
But you must not spoil me now, for if you do I shall
cry, and all my morning's work will come to an end.
Mamma is coming downstairs to-day, and all is to be
as  it can never be again,' said Anne, with an abrupt
interruption of herself. ' But in the meantime it is
very needful for me to know what I am to do. I
want you to tell me while we are safe  while we are
alone.'

My dear Anne,' said the old lawyer, * my dear
Anne ! * and the tears came to his eyes. ' I wish I
were everything that I can't be  a fairy prince or a
romantic hero  for your sake.'

I like you a great deal better as Mr. Loseby
than if you were a fairy prince.'

I dare say that is true ; but in the one case I
might have delivered you, and in the other I can't.
Do ! I don't know what you have got to do.'

Somebody must,' said Anne. ' Tell me, please.
Am I the guardian, or what does it mean ? In
Trust ! It might be a great deal, or it might not be
much. I want to do my duty, Mr. Loseby.'

That I am sure you will do, whatever happens.
You will have to administer the whole, and watch
over the money, and look out for the investments.
It is the most extraordinary office for you : but we
will not say anything about that.'

No : but I do not think it is such an extraordinary
office. If the money had been mine, I should
have had it to do naturally, and of course I shall doit
with all the more care when it is for Eose. The

pity is that I don't know anything about it,' said
Anne, gravely. ' But I suppose there are books on
the subject, books about money and how to manage
it. You must tell me how to learn my new profession,'
she added with a smile. 'It is a curious
thing all at once to wake up and find that one hasa
trade.'

I don't see how you can call it a trade.'

*0h, yes, Mr. Loseby, and I am to have
5001. a-year of pay  I shall not be worth half so
much. When I was young,' said Anne, with the
serene consciousness of maturity, ' it was one of my
fancies to learn something that I could live by. I
am afraid I thought of quite little pettifogging
businesses  little bits of art-work or such like. I shall
be a kind of land-steward with a little of a stockbroker
in me, now.'

Yes, something of that sort,' he said, humouring
her, looking at her with a smile.

Curious,' said Anne, with a gleam of laughter
getting into her eyes, ' I think I shall like it too ; it
ought to be amusing  it ought to have an interest 

and you know everybody says that what we girls want
is an interest in our lives.'

You have never wanted an interest in your
life.'

No, I do not think I have ; but you must not
look so sorry  I am not sorry for myself. What
does it matter after all ? ' said Anne, raising her head
with that lofty visionary defiance of all evil. ' There
are things which one could not consent to lose 
which it really breaks one's heart to lose  which
would need to be torn and wrenched out of one : you
know, Mr. Loseby ? but not money ; how different
when it is only money ! The mere idea that you
might lose the one makes you feel what loss would
be, makes you contemptuous of the other.'

I know ?  do you think I know ?  Indeed, my
dear, I cannot tell,' said Mr. Loseby, shaking his
head. ' If I lost what I have, I should not find it
at all easy to console myself. I don't think I should
be contemptuous or indifferent if all my living were
to go.'

Ah ! ' she cried, with a sudden light of compunction

and pity in her eyes, ' but that is because

you Oh, forgive me I ' with a sudden perception

of what she was saying.

That is because I have not much else to lose ? '
said the old lawyer. ' Don't be sorry for saying it ;
it is true. 1 lost all I had in that way, my dear, as
you know, many many years ago. Life, to be sure,
has changed very much since then, but I am not
unhappy. I have learnt to be content ; and it would
make a great difference to me if I lost what I have
to live upon. Anne, I have got something to tell
you which I think will make you happier.'

She looked at him eagerly with her lips apart,
her eyes full of beseech ling earnestness.  It is about
your father, Anne.'

Her countenance changed a little, but kept its
eagerness. She had not expected anything to make
her happier from that quarter ; but she was almost
more anxious than before to hear what it was.

Your cousin has been telling me  you heard his
proposal about the entail, which, alas I no time was
left us to discuss ?  he thinks from what your father

said to him,' said the lawyer, leaning across the
table and putting his hand upon hers, 'that he
meant to have arranged this according to Heath-cote
Montfort's wishes, and to have settled Mount
on you.'

Anne could not speak at first. The tears that
had been gathering in her eyes overflowed and fell
in a warm shower upon Mr. Loseby's hand. ' My
cousin Heathcote told you this ? ' she said, half sobbing,
after a pause.

Yes, Anne. I thought it would please you to
know.'

Please me ! ' she made a little pause again,
sobbing and smiling. Then she clasped his old hand
in both hers with sudden enthusiasm. 'It makes
me perfectly happy ! ' she cried : ' nothing, nothing
troubles me any more.'

Then, with natural feminine instinct, she wanted
to hear every detail from him of the distinct conversation
which she immediately concluded to have
taken place between her father and her cousin.
Though no one was more ready to jump to conclusions,

Anne became as matter-of-fact as Eose herself
in her eagerness to know everything that had taken
place. The old lawyer did not feel himself able to
cope with her questions. ' I was not present,' he said ;
'but your cousin himself is here, and he will tell
you. Yes, there he is, looking at the books. I
am going to fetch some papers I left in my bedroom.
Mr. Heathcote, will you come and explain it all while
I am away ? '

He chuckled to himself with satisfaction as he
left them together : but after all what was the use ?
Good Lord,' he cried to himself, ' why couldn't the
fellow have come a year ago ? ' To see how Providence
seems to take a pleasure in making the best
of plans impracticable I It was inconceivable that
nobody had sense enough ever to have thought of
that plan before.

But when Anne found herself face to face with
Heathcote Montfort, and suddenly discovered that
he had been present all the time, she did not feel the
same disposition to pursue her inquiries. Lie had
even a feeling that she had committed herself, though

she could scarcely tell how. She rose up from her
seat with a faint smile, mastering her tears and excitement.
' Thank you for telling Mr. Loseby what
has made me so happy,' she said. Then added,
Indeed, it was more for others than myself. I
knew all the time my father had not meant to wrong
anyone; no, no, he never was unjust in his life;
but others, strangers, like yourself, how were you to
know ? '

I am sure this was what he meant,' Heathcote
said, putting much more fervour into the asseveration
than it would have required had it been as certain ashe
said. Anne was chilled a little by his very
warmth, but she would not admit this.

'I was very certain of it always,' she said,
though I did not know how he meant it to be.
But now, Mr. Heathcote, thank you, thank you withall
my heart ! you have set that matter to rest.'

Was it really good for her to think that the
matter was set at rest, that there never had been any
doubt about it, that nothing but honour, and justice,
and love towards her had ever been in her father's

thoughts ? No doubt she would set up some theory
of the same kind to explain, with the same certainty,
the sluggishness of the other, of the fellow who,
having a right to support her, had left her to stand
alone in her trouble. This brought a warm glow of
anger into Heathcote's veins ; but he could only
show it by a little impatience expressed with a laugh
over a small grievance of his own.

You said Cousin Heathcote just now. I think
after all we have seen and felt together, that a title
at least as familiar as that might be mine.'

Surely,' she said, with so friendly a smile, that
Heathcote felt himself ridiculously touched. Why
this girl should with a smile make him feel disposed
to weep, if that were possible to a man of his age, he
could not tell. It was too absiud, but perhaps it was
because of the strange position in which she herself
stood, and the way in which she occupied it, declaring
herself happy in her loss, yet speaking with such
bated breath of the other loss which she had discovered
to be possible, and which, in being possible,
had taken all feeling about her fortune away from

her. A woman, standing thus alone among all the
storms, so young, so brave, so magnanimous, touches
a man's heart in spite of himself. This was how he
explained it. As he looked at her, he found it difficult
to keep the moisture out of his eyes.

I want to speak to you about business,' he said.

Mr. Loseby is not the only instructor in that art.
Will you tell me  don't think I am impertinent :
where you intend  where you wish  to live ? '

A flush came upon Anne's face. She thought he
wanted possession of his own house, which was so
natural. ' We will not stay to trouble you ! ' she
cried. Then, overcoming the little impulse of pride,

Forgive me. Cousin Heathcote, that was not what
you meant, I know. We have not talked of it, we
have had no consultation as yet. Except Mount,
where I have always lived, one place is the same as
another to me.'

But while she said this there was something in
Anne's eyes that contradicted her, and he thought
that he could read what it meant. He felt that he
knew better than she knew herself, and this gave

him zeal in his proposal ; though what he wanted
was not to further but to hinder the wish which he
divined in her heart.

If this is the case, why not stay at Mount ? '
Heathcote said. ' Listen to me ; it is of no use tome
; I am not rich enough to keep it up. This is
why I wanted to get rid of it. You love the place
and everything about it  whereas it is nothing tome.'


Is it so ? ' said Anne, with a voice of regret.
[Mount I  nothing to you ? '

'It was nothing to me, at least till the other
day ; and to you it is so much. All your associations
are connected with it ; you were born here, and
have all your friends here,' said Heathcote, unconsciously
enlarging upon the claims of the place, as if
to press them upon an unwilling hearer. Why
should he think she was unwilling to acknowledge
her love for her home ? And yet Anne felt in her
heart that there was divination in what he said.

But, Cousin Heathcote, it is yours, not ours. It
was our home, but it is no longer so. Don't you

think it would be more hard to have no right to it,
and yet stay, than to give it np and go? The
happiness of Mount is over,' she said softly. * It is
no longer to us the one place in the world.'

That is a hard thing to say to me, Anne.'

'Is it ? why so ? When you are settled in it,
years after this, if you will ask me, I will come to
see you, and be quite happy,' said Anne with a
smile ; ' indeed I shall ; it is not a mean dislike to
see you here. That is the course of nature. We
always knew it was to be yours. There is no feeling
of wrong, no pain at all in it ; but it is no longer
ours. Don't you see the difference ? I am sure you
see it,' she said.

But if your father had carried out his intention
'

Do you know,' said Anne, looking at him with
a half wistful, half smiling look, ' on second thoughts
it would perhaps be better not to say anything to
mamma or Rose about my father's intention ? They
might think it strange. They might say that was no
punishment at all. I am very glad to know it for

my own comfort, and that you should understand
how really just he was ; hut they might not see it in
the same light.'

And it has nothing to do with the question,' said
Heathcote, almost roughly ; ' the opportunity for
such an arrangement is over. Whether he intended
or whether he did not intend it  I cannot give you
Mount.'

No, no ; certainly you cannot give it tome
'

'At least,' he cried, carried beyond himself by
the excitement of the moment. * There was only
one way in which I could have given it to you : and
that, without ever leaving me the chance, without
thinking of any claim I had, you have put out of
my power  you have made impossible, Anne I '

She looked at him, her eyes opened wider, her
lips dropping apart, with a sort of consternation :
then a tinge of warmer colour gradually rose over her
face. The almost fierceness of his tone, the aggrieved
voice and expression had something half ludicrous in
it ; but in her surprise this was not visible to Anne.
And he saw that he had startled her, which is always
satisfactory. She owed him reparation for this,

VOL. II. Q

though it was an unintentional wrong. He ended
with a severity of indignation which overwhelmed
her.

It does not seem to me that I was ever thought
of, that anyone took me into consideration. I was
never allowed to have a chance. Before I came here,
my place, the place I might have claimed, was
appropriated. And now I must keep Mount though
I do not want it, and you must leave it though
you do want it, when our interests might have been
one. But no, no, I am mistaken. You do not
want it now, though it is your home. You think
you will prefer London, because London is '

Mr. Heathcote Montfort, I think you forget
what you are saying '

Don't call me that at least,' he cried ; ' don't
thrust me away again as a stranger. Yes, I am
absurd ; I have no right to claim any place or any
rights. If I had not been a fool, I should have
come here a year, five years ago, as old Loseby says.'

What is that about old Loseby ? ' said the
lawyer, coming into the room. He was carrying a

portfolio in his hands, which, let us hope, he had
honestly gone to look for when he left them. Anyhow
he carried it ostentatiously as if this had been
his natural object in his absence. But the others
were too much excited to notice his portfolio or his
severely business air. At least Heathcote was excited,
who felt that he had evidently made a fool of himself,
and had given vent to a bit of ridiculous
emotion, quite uncalled for, without any object, and
originating he could not tell how. What was the
meaning of it, he would have asked himself, but
that the fumes of his own words had got into his
head. He turned away, quite beyond his own control,
when the lawyer appeared, his heart beating,
his blood coursing through his veins. How had all
this tempest got up in an instant ? Did it come
from nothing, and mean nothing? or had it been
there within him, lying quiescent all this time. He
could not answer the question, nor, indeed, for that
matter, did he ask it, being much too fully occupied
for the moment with the commotion which had thus

Q 2

suddenly got up like the boiling of a volcano within
him, without any will of his own.

And Anne was too much bewildered, too much
astonished to say anything. She could not believe
her own ears. It seemed to her that her senses must
be playing her false, that she could not be seeing
aright or hearing aright  or else what did it mean ?
Mr. Loseby glided in between them with his portfolio,
feeling sure they would remark his little artifice
and understand his stratagem ; but he had succeeded
in that stratagem so much better than he thought,
that they paid no attention to him at all.

What are you saying about old Loseby ? ' he
asked. ' It is not civil in the first place, Mr. Heath-cote,
to call your family man of business old. It is
a contumelious expression. I am not sure that it is
not actionable. That reminds me that I have never
had anything to do with your branch of the family 
which, no doubt, is the reason why you take this
liberty. I am on the other side '

Do me this service, then, at once,' said Heath-cote,
coming back from that agitated little walk

with which a man who has been committing himself
and showing uncalled-for emotion so often relieves
his feelings. ' Persuade my cousins to gratify me
by staying at Mount. I have clearly told you I
should not know what to do with it. If they will
stay nothing need be changed.'

It is a very good idea,' said Mr. Loseby. ' I
think an excellent idea. They will pay you a rent
for it which wil be reasonable, which will not be
exorbitant.'

They shall do nothing of the sort,' cried Heath-cote
: ' rent  between me and '

Yes, between you and JVIrs. Montfort, the
most reasonable proposal in the world. It is really a
thing to be taken into your full consideration, Aime.
Of course you must live somewhere. And there is
no place you would like so well.'

Here a guilty flush came upon Anne's face.
She stole a furtive glance at Heathcote to see if he
were observing her. She did not wish to give him
the opportunity of saying ' I told you so,' or convicting
her out of her own mouth.

I think mamma and Eose have some idea  that
is, there was some talk  Eose has always wanted
masters whom we can't get here. There was an idea
of settling in London  for a time '

He did not turn round, which was merciful. If
he had divined her, if he now understood her, he gave
no sign at least. This was generous, and touched
Anne's heart.

In London ! Now, what on earth would you do
in London, country birds like Eose and you? I
don't say for a little time in the season, to see the
pictures, and hear some music, and that sort of
thing; but settling in London, what would you do
that for ? You would not like it ; I feel sure you
would not like it. You never could like it, if you
tried.'

To this Anne was dumb, making no response.
She stood with her eyes cast down, her face flushed
and abashed, her two hands clasped together, as
much like a confused and naughty child as it was
possible for Anne to be. She gave once more an instantaneous,
furtive glance from under her downcast

eyelids at Heathcote. Would he rejoice over her to
see his guess, his impertinent guess, proved true ?
But Heathcote was taking another agitated turnabout
the room, to blow off his own excitement, and
was not for the moment obsen-ant of hers.

After this Mr. Loseby began to impart to Anne
real information about the duties which would lee
required of her, to which she gave what attention
she could. But this was not so much as could have
been desired. Her mind was running over with
various thoughts of her own, impulses which had
come to her from another mind, and new aspects of
old questions. She left the library as soon as she
could, in order to get back to the shelter of her own
room and there think them out. Had Heathcote
known how little attention she gave to his own
strange, unintentional self-betrayal  if it was indeed
a self-betrayal, and not a mere involuntary
outbreak of the moment, some nervous impulse or
other, incomprehensible to the speaker as to the
hearer  he would have been sadly humbled. But, asa
matter of fact, Anne scarcely thought of his words

at all. He had made some mistake, she felt
sure. She had not heard him right, or else she had
missed the real meaning of what he said, for that
surface meaning was of course impossible. But she
did think about the other matter. He had divined
her almost more clearly than she had understood
herself. When she had decided that to go to
London would be the best thing the family could do,
she had carefully directed her mind to other
motives ; to the facilities of getting masters for
Eose, and books, and everything that was interesting
; to the comfort and ease of life in a place where
everything could be provided so easily, where there
would be no great household to keep up. She had
thought of the cheerfulness of a bright little house
near the parks, and all the things there would be to
see  the interests on all sides, the means of occupying
themselves. But she had not thought  had she
thought ?  that Cosmo would be at hand, that he
would be within reach, that he might be the companion
of many expeditions, the sharer of many

occupations. Had she secretly been thinking of this
all the time ? had this been her motive and not the
other ? Heathcote Montfort had seen through her
and had divined it, though she had not known it
herself. She paused now to ask herself with no
small emotion, if this were true ; and she could not
say that it was not true or half true. If it were so,
was it not maidenly, unwomanly, wrong to go
after him, since he did not come to her ? She had
made up her mind to it without being conscious of
that motive: but now the veil was torn from her
eyes, and she was aware of the weakness in her own
heart. Ought she to go, being now suite that to be
near Cosmo was one of her chief objects ; or would it
be better to remain at Mount as Heathcote's tenant ?
Anne's heart sank down, down to the lowest depth ;
but she was a girl who could defy her heart and all
her inclinations when need was. She threw herself
back as a last resource upon the others who had to
be consulted. Though she knew she could tm-n
them as she pleased, yet she proposed to herself

to make an oracle of them. According to their
response, who knew nothing about it, who would
speak according to the chance impression of the
moment, so should the decision be.

Chapter XXIV.

A VISITOR.

That evening all things had recommenced to be at

Mount as ' they could never be again,' as Anne

said : that is, the habits of the first week of mourning
had been laid aside, the ladies had come downstairs,
and appeared at table, and everything returned
to its use and wont. Mr. Montfort's place
was left vacant at the table. Heathcote would not
take it though he had been assured, with tears, that
the family would wish it so to be, and that no one
would feel wounded by his assumption of his rights.
I will sit where I have always sat if you will let
me,' he said, putting himself at Mrs. Montfort's
light hand. Thus he sat between her and Rose, who
was pleased by what she thought the preference he
showed her. Rose dearly liked to be preferred 

and, besides, Heathcote was not to be despised in
any way. Grave thoughts of uniting the property
had already entered her little head. He was not
young, indeed he was distinctly old in Rose's
juvenile eyes, but she said to herself that when a
man has so much in his favour a trifling matter like
age does not count. She was very serious, what her
mother called practical, in her ways of thinking :
and the importance of uniting the property affected
Rose. Therefore she was glad that he seemed to
like her best, to choose her side of the table. Anne
sat opposite, contemplating them all serenely, meeting
Heathcote's eyes without any shyness, which was
more than he could boast in respect to her. He
scarcely addressed her at all during the time of
dinner, and he never, she perceived, broached to her
stepmother or sister the question which he had
discussed with her with so much vehemence. At
dinner Anne felt herself at leisure  she was able to
look at him and observe him, as she had never done
before. He had a very handsome face, more like
the ideal hero of a book than anything that is

usually met with in the world. His eyes were large
and dark ; his nose straight ; his hair dark, too, and
framing his face as in a picture. 'I do not like
handsome men,' Anne said to herself. She smiled
when the thought had formed in her mind, smiled
at herself. Cosmo was not handsome ; he was of no
particular colour, and had no very striking features.
People said of him that he was gentlemanlike. It
was the only thing to say. But here was a face
which really was beautiful. Beauty I in a man she
said to herself I and felt that she disliked it. But
she could not but look at him across the table. She
could not lift her eyes without seeing him. His
face was the kind of face that it was natural to suppose
should express fine sentiments, high-flown,
Anne said to herself, she whom everybody else called
high-flown. But he listened with a smile to Rose
who was not of that constitution of mind.

After dinner, when the ladies were alone in the
drawing-room, Anne made their cousin's proposal
known to them : that they should continue to live
at Mount, paying him rent according to Mr. Loseby's

suggestion. She did not herself wish to accept this
proposal  but a kind of opposition was roused in herby
the blank manner in which it was listened to
She had been struggling against a guilty sense of her
own private inclination to go to London, to be in
the same place with her lover  but she did not see
why they should wish the same thing. There seemed
to Anne to be a certain impertinence in any inclination
of theirs which should turn the same way.
What inducement had they to care for London, or
any change of residence? Though they were virtually
backing her up, yet she was angry with them
for it. 'I thought you would be sure to wish to
stay,' she said.

You see, Anne,' said Mrs. Montfort, with some
hesitation, ' it is not now as it was before ; when we
were all happy together, home was home. But now,
after all we have gone through  and things would
not be the same as before  your sister wants a
change  and so do you '

Do not think of me,' said Anne, hastily.

But it is my duty to think of you, too. Rose

has always been delicate, and the winters at Mount
are trying, and this year, of course, you would have
no variety, no society. I am sure it is very kind of
Heathcote : but if we could get a comfortable little
house in town  a change,' said Mrs. Montfort,
growing bolder, 'would do us all good.'

Oh, don't let us stay at Mount,' cried Rose,
In the wet, cold winter days it is terrible. I have
never liked Mount in winter. Do let us get away
now that we can get away. I have never seen anything.
Let us go to town till the spring, and then
let us go abroad.'

That is what I should like,' said Mrs. Montfort,
meekly. ' Change of air and scene is always recommended.
You are very strong, Anne, you don't feel
it so much  you could go on for ever ; but people
that are more delicately organised, people who feel
things more, can't just settle down after trouble like
ours. We ought to move about a little and have
thorough change of scene.'

Anne was amazed at herself for the annoyance,
the resentment, the resistance to which she felt

herself moved. It was simple perversity, she felt, for
in her heart she wanted to move, perhaps more than
they did  and she had a reason for her wish  but
they had none. It was mere wanton desire for
change on their part. She was angry, though she
saw how foolish it was to be angry. ' It was
extremely kind of Heathcote to make such a proposal,'
she said.

I don't say it was not kind, Anne  but he feels
that he cannot keep it up. He does not like the
idea of leaving the place all dismantled and uninhabited.
You may tell him I will leave the
furniture ; I should not think of taking it away, just
at present. I think we should look about us,' said
Mrs. Montfort, ' before we settle anywhere ; and
select a really good place  which Mount would
never be she added, with a little shaking out of her
crape, ' for us, in our changed circumstances. It
may be very kind of Heathcote  but I don't see that
we can do it. It would be too much to expect.'

And Anne was silenced, not knowing what pleas
to bring forward for the defeat of the cause which

was her own cause; but she was angry that the'
should presume to think so too. What was town to
them ? They had no one in it to make that great
wilderness feel like home. They had no inducement
that she knew of. She felt reluctant to be
happy by such unreasonable means.

Keziah, the little maid to whom Anne had,
during the interval since she was last mentioned,
imparted a great deal of very energetic advice as to
the duty of holding fast to her lover, and ta king no
thought of interest, had red eyes that night when
she came to put her mistress's things away. Anne
was very independent. She did not require much
actual service. It was Eose who benefited by
Keziah's services in this respect. But when she was
dismissed by Rose she came into the room where
Anne sat writing, and instead of doing her work as
usual with noiseless speed, and taking herself away,
she hovered about for a long time, poking the fire,
arranging things that had no particular need of
arranging, and crossing and re-crossing Anne's point

VOL. II. K

of view. She had red eyes, but there was in her
little person an air of decision that was but seldom
apparent there. This Anne perceived, when, attracted
at length by these manoeuvres, she put away
her writing and looked up. ' Keziah,' she said,
how are things going ? I can't help thinking you
have something to say to me to-night.'

Yes, Miss Anne,' said the girl, very composedly ;
I have got something to say  I wanted you to
know, as you've always been so kind and taken an
interest  people has the same sort of feelings, I
suppose, whether they're quality or whether they're
common folks  '

That is very true, Keziah. I suspect we are all
of the same flesh and blood.'

Don't you laugh at me. Miss Anne. Miss
Anne, I would like to tell you as I've made up my
mind to-night.'

I hope you have made a right decision, Keziah,'
said Anne, with some anxiety, feeling suspicious of
the red eyes.

'Oh, I'm not afraid of its being right  Miss

Anne. If it wasn't right,' said the little girl, with a
wan smile, ' I don't think as it would be as hard.
I'd have settled sooner if it hadn't been for thinking
what Jim would say,' she added, a tear or two
coming to dilate her eyes ; ' it wasn't for myself. If
you do your duty. Miss Anne, you can't do no more.'

Then Keziah, you have been talked over,' said
Anne, with some indignation, rising up from her
<iesk. 'Worth has been worrying you, and you
have not been able to resist her. Why did you not
tell her, as I told you, to come and have it out with
me?'

I don't know what good that would have done,
Miss Anne. It was me that had to settle after all.'

Of course it was you that had to settle. Had it
been anyone else I should not have lost all this time,
I should have interfered at once. Keziah, do you
know what you are doing ? A young girl like you,
just my age  (but I am not so young, I have had
so much to think of, and to go through), to sell herself
to an old man.'

Miss Anne, I'm not selling myself ' said Keziah,

B 2

with a little flush of resentment. ' He hasn't given

me anything, not so much as a ring 1 wouldn't

have it of him 1 wouldn't take not a silver

thimble, though he's always teasing  for fear you

should say Whatever anyone may think, they

can't say as I've sold myself,' said Keziah proudly.
.* r wouldn't take a thing from him, not if it was to
save his life.'

This is mere playing upon words, Keziah,' said
Anne, towering over the victim in virtuous indignation.
' Old Saymore is well off and poor Jim has
nothing. What do you call that but selling
yourself? But it is not your doing I it is Worth's
doing. Why doesn't he marry her ? It would be a
great deal more suitable than marrying you.'

*He don't seem to see that. Miss Anne,' said
Keziah with a demure half curtsey : a certain comic
sense of the absurdity of marrying the aunt when the
niece was by, crept into the profound seriousness of
her looks. That anybody should suppose old Say-more
would marry Worth gave the girl a melancholy
amusement in spite of herself

She would be far more suitable,' cried Anne in
lier impetuous way. ' I think I'll speak to them
both and set it before them. It would be a thousand
times more suitable. But old Saymore is too old
even for Worth : what would he be for you ? '

Keziah looked at her young mistress with eyes
full of very mingled feelings. The possibility of
being delivered by the simple expedient of a sudden
match got up by the tormentors themselves gave
her a half-frightened visionary hope, but it was
mixed with a half-offended sentiment of proprietorship
which she could scarcely acknowledge : old Say-more
belonged to her. She would have liked to get
free from the disagreeable necessity of marrying him,
but she did not quite like the idea of seeing him
married off to somebody else under her very eyes.

It's more than just that, Miss Anne,' she said,
shaking her head. ' All of us in the house are
thinking of what is likely to happen, and Mr. Saymore,
he says he will never take another place after having
been so long here. And he has a good bit of money
laid by. Miss Anne,' said Keziah, not without pride.

< And Mr. goodman, of the " Black Bull " at Huns-ton,
he's dead. That's where we're thinking of
settling. I know how to keep the books and makeup
the bills, and mother she would be in the kitchen,
and such a fine opening for the boys. I don't know
what I shouldn't deserve if I were to set up myself
against all that. And it isn't myself neither,' said
Keziah. ' I should be ashamed to make a fuss forme.
I have always told you that, Miss Anne. I
hope I'm not one as would go against my duty. It's
Jim I've always thought upon. Men folks are more
wilful than women. They are more used to get
their own way. If he was to go to the bad, Miss
Anne, and me the cause of it '

Here Keziah broke down, and wept without any
further attempt to restrain her tears.

 I don't understand you,' cried Anne impetuously.
You pretend to be sorry for him, and this is how
you treat him. But leave Jim to take care of himself,
Keziah. Let us think of you. This is what I
call going to the bad. Poor Jim might take to
drinking, perhaps, and ruin himself  but I don't

think that is so much going to the bad as to love one
man and marry another. That is the worst of sin,'
said the girl, with cheeks and eyes both flaming,
It is treachery, it is falsehood, it is dishonour, to
you and to every one concerned.'

Poor little Keziah quailed before this outburst.
She shrank back with a look of pain as if she feared
her mistress's wrath would take some tangible form.
She cried bitterly, sobbing aloud, ' You've got no call
to be angry. Miss Anne. You didn't ought to be
angry. Miss Anne. I'm a-going to domy duty ; it's
nothing but my duty as I'm going to do ! '

Anne felt, when the interview was over, that she
had in all probability done more harm than good.
She had frightened Keziah, and made her cong all
the more to the comfort which sprang from a settled
resolution, and she had even stimulated that resolve
by the prick of opposition which moves the meekest
of natures. She had made Keziah feel herself
wronged, her sacrifice unappreciated, her duty misconceived,
and the girl had fallen back with all the
more confidence upon the approval of her (as Anne

thought) worldly-minded aunt, and the consolation
of the old bridegroom, who, though he was old, was a
great man in the servants' hall  great as the butler
and head of the establishment downstairs, and still
more great as the prospective landlord of the ' Black
Bull ' at Hunston. To be the future mistress of such
a place was a glory enough to turn a girl's head.
Keziah went away crying, and feeling that she had
not deserved the cruel ' scolding ' administered by
Miss Anne. She going to the bad ! when she was
doing her duty in the highest and most superlative
way, and had hanging over her head, almost touching
it, the crown of that landlady's cap, with the most
becoming ribbons, which ranks like the strawberry
leaves of another elevation in the housekeeper's room
and the servants' hall.

It was the morning after this that Cosmo arrived.
Anne was going downstairs to a morning's work with
Mr. Loseby, thoughtful and serious as she always was
now; but by this time all the strangeness of her
position was over ; she had got used to it and even
reconciled to it. She had work to do, and a position

in the world which was all that one wanted for
happiness. Indeed, she was better off, she said to
herself, than if she had been in her natural position.
In that case, in all probability, she would have had
someone else to do for her what she was now
to do for Rose, and her occupation would have
been gone. She felt that she had passed into
the second chapter of life  as if she lead married,
she said to herself with a passing blush  though so
different. She had real work to do in the world,
not make-believe, but actual  not a thing she could
throw aside if she pleased, or was doing only for
amusement. Perhaps it requires a whole life of
leisure, and ideas shaped by that exemption from
ware which so often strikes the generous mind as
ignoble, which made her appreciate so highly this
fine burden of real unmistakable work, not done to
occupy her time merely, but because it had to be
done. She prepared herself for it, not only without
pain but with actual pleasure. But on her way
down to the library, where Mr. Loseby was waiting
her, Anne chanced to cast her eyes out from the end

of the corridor across the park. It was the same
window to which she had rushed to listen to the cry
the night her father died. It had been night then,
with a white haze of misty moonlight and great
shadows of blackness. But now it was morning, and
the red sunshine lighted up the hoar frost on the
grass, already pursuing it into corners, melting away
the congealed dew upon the herbs and trees. She
stood for a moment's meditation, still gazing out
without any object, scarcely knowing why. To a
thoughtful and musing mind there is a great
attraction at a window, which is a kind of opening
in the house and in one's being, full of long wistful
vistas of inspection into the unseen. But Anne had
not been there many minutes before a cry broke from
her lips, and her whole aspect changed. Charley
Ashley was coming along the road which crossed the
park  but not alone. A thrill ran through her from
her head to her feet. In a moment her mind went
over the whole of the past fortnight's story. Her chill
and dumbness of disappointment, which she would
not express even to herself, when he did not come ;

her acquiescence of reason (but still with a chill of
the heart) in his explanations ; the subdued sense of
restraint, and enforced obedience to other rules, not
first or only to those of the hearts and the effort
with which she had bowed herself; her solitude, her
longing for support, her uneasiness every way inter
the yoke which he had thought it necessary to impose
upon himself and her ; all this seemed to pass before
her view in a moment. She had acquiesced ; she
had even reasoned herself into satisfaction ; but oh !
the glorious gleam of approval with which Anne saw
all that she had consented to beforehand in the light
of the fact that now he was here : now he was coming,
all reason for his staying away being over  not
hurriedly, as if wishing to chase the recollection of
her father from her mind, or to grudge him that last
pre-eminence in the thoughts of those belonging to
him, which is the privilege of every man who dies.
Cosmo had fulfilled every reverent duty towards him
who was his enemy. He had done what it was most
difficult to do. He had kept away till all the rites
were accomplished ; and now he was coming I All

was over, not one other observance of affection possible
the very widow coming out again, thinking (a little)
of the set of her cap and planning to go abroad in
spring. And now there was no longer any reason
why the lover should stay away. If there is one
feeling in the world which is divine, it is the sense
of full approval of those whom one loves most. To
be able with one's whole heart to consent and know
that all they have done is well, to approve them not
with blindness (though that is the silliest fable) of
love, or its short-sightedness, but, on the contrary,
with all its enlightenment in the eyes that cannot be
content with less than excellence : to look on and see
everything and approve  this, and not any personal
transport or enjoyment, is heaven. Anne, standing
by the window seeing the two figures come in sight,
in a moment felt the gates of Paradise open before
her, and was swept within them by a silent flood of
joy. She approved, making no exception, reserving
nothing. As she walked downstairs, her feet did not
seem to touch the ground. What a poor, small?
ignoble little being she had been not to read him all

the time ; but now that the illumination had come,
and she saw his conduct from first to last, Anne saw,
or thought she saw, that everything was right,
everything noble. She approved, and was happy.
She forgot Mr. Loseby and the morning's business,
and walked towards the hall with a serene splendour
about her, a glory as of the moon and the stars, all
beautiful in reflected light.

There was nobody in the hail, and the kind
curate when he came in did nothing but pass
through it. ' I suppose I shall find them in the
drawing-room ? ' he said, waving his hand and
walking past. Anne accepted the passing greeting
gladly. AMiat did she want with Charley ? He
went through the hall while the other came to her
side.

'' You wanted me, Anne ? '

Wanted you  oh, how I have wanted you ! 
there has been so much to do ; but I approve, Cosmo
I approve everything you have done. I feel it
right that I should have stood alone till now. You
help me more in doing my duty, than if you had

done all for me. You were right all along, all
through '

Thank you, my dearest,' he said. ' But, Anne,
I see in what you say that there have been moments
in which you have not approved. This was what I
feared  and it would have been so much easier todo
what was pleasant.'

No  I do not think there were moments  at
least not anything more. Cosmo, what do you
think of me now, a woman without a penny? I
wonder if you approve of me as I approve of you.'

I think I do more, dear ; I admire, though I
don't think I could have been so brave myself. If
you had not been just the girl you are, I fear I
should have said. Throw me over and let us wait.'

You did say it,' she said in a lower tone ; ' that
is the only thing of all that I do not like in you.'

To think you should have undergone such a loss
for me!  and I am not worth it  it humbles me,
Anne. I could not believe it was possible. Up to
the last minute I felt it could not be.'

Oh, Cosmo, if thou wouldst be perfect ! but ne did
not see it, or he did not do it at least.

I cannot understand it yet,' he went on. ' Such
injustice, such cruelty  do I pain you, my darling ?
I cannot help it. If it had been only the postponement
of all our hopes, that would have been bad
enough : but to take your rights from you arbitrarily,
absolutely, without giving you any choice '

I would so much rather you did not speak of it,
Cosmo. It cannot be mended. I have got to accept
it and do the best I can,' she said.

You take it like an angel, Anne. T knew you

would do that : but I am not an angel : and to have
all our happiness thrust into the distance, indefinitely,
making the heart sick  you must not expect
me to take it so easily. If I had been rich indeed 
how one longs to be rich sometimes I ' he said, almost
hurting her with the close clasp of his arm. Every
word he said was true ; he loved her even with
passion, as he understood passion. And if he had been
rich, Cosmo would have satisfied that judgment of hers,
which once more, in spite of her, was up in the tribunal,
watchful, anxious, not able to blind its eyes.

I do not long to be rich,' she said ; ' little will
content me.'

My dearest ! ' he said with tender enthusiasm,
with so much love in his looks and tone, so much
admiration, almost adoration, that Anne's heart was
put to silence in spite of herself. How is a woman,
a girl, to remain uninfluenced by all these signs of
attachment ? She could not repulse them ; she
could not say, All this is nothing. If thou would'st
be perfect ! Her consciousness of something wanting
was not put away, but it was subdued, put down.

forced into the shade. How could she insist upon
what was, indeed, the final test of his attachment ?
how could she even indicate it ? Anne had, in her
mind, no project of manage which would involve
the laying aside of all the active practical duties
which her father had left as his only legacy to her ;
but that her lover should take it for granted that her
loss postponed all their hopes, was not a thing which,
in itself, was pleasant to think of. She could not
banish this consciousness from her mind. But ii?
those early moments when Cosmo was so tender,
when his love was so evident, how could she hold
back and doubt him ? It was easier by far to put a
stop upon herself, and to silence her indefinite, indefinable
dissatisfaction. For in every respect but
this Cosmo was perfect. When he presented himself
before Isis. Montfort his demeanour was everything
that could be desired. He threw himself into all
their arrangements, and asked about their plans nth
the gentle insistence of one who had a right to know.
He promised, nay offered, at once to begin the search
for a house, which was the first thing to be done.

VOL. II. s

It will be the pleasantness of duties,' he said. * What
a difference to my life ! It will be like living by
the gates of heaven, to live in the same place with
you, to know I may come and see you : or even come
and look at the house you are in.' ' Certainly,' Mrs.
Montfort said afterwards, 'Mr. Douglas was very
nice. I wonder why dear papa was so prejudiced
against him, for, indeed, nothing could be nicer than
the way he talked ; and he will be a great help to us
in finding a house.' He stayed the whole day, and
his presence made everything go smoothly. The
dinner-table was absolutely cheerful with the aid of
his talk, his town news, his latest information about
everything. He pleased everybody, even down to
old Saymore, who had not admired him before.
Cosmo had to leave next day, having, as he told them,
while the courts were sitting, no possibility of a
holiday ; but he went charged with many commissions,
and taking the position almost of a member of the
family  a son of the house. Anne walked with him
to the village to see him go ; and the walk through
the park, though everything was postponed, was like

a walk through Paradise to both. * To think that I
am going to prepare for your arrival is something
more than words can say,' he told her as they parted.
I cannot understand how I can be so happy.' All
this lulled her heart to rest, and filled her mind with
sweetness, and did everything that could be done to
hoodwink that judgment which Anne herself would
so fain have blindfolded and drowned. This she did
not quite succeed in doing  but at all events she
silenced it, and kept it quiescent. She began to
prepare for the removal with great alacrity and
pleasure ; indeed, the thought of it cheered them all
all at least except Heathcote Moimtford, whose
views had been so different, and whose indignation and
annoyance, though suppressed, were visible enough.
He was the only one who had not liked Cosmo. But
then he did not like the family plans, nor their
destination, nor anything, Rose said with a little
pique. Anne, for her part, avoided Heathcote,
and declared to herself that she could not bear him.
What right had he to set up a tribunal at which
Cosmo was judged. That she should do it was bad

enough, but a stranger! She knew exactly what
Heath cote thought. Was it because she thought so,
too, that she divined him, and knew what was in his
heart ?

CHAPTER XXV.

PACKING UP.

Mount was soon turned upside down with all the
excitement of packing. It was a relief from the
monotony which hangs about a house from which the
world is shut out, and where the family life is still
circling round one melancholy event. Days look like
years in these circumstances ; even when the grief
is of the deepest those who are left behind must
do something to keep the dulled wheels of life in
motion, since not even the most truly bereaved candie
of grief when they will. But in the case of the
Mountfords the affliction was not excessive. Anne,
whom her father had wronged, perhaps mourned most
of all, not because of more love, but more depth
of nature, which could not leave the old so lightly
to tm-n to the new, and which felt more awe and

reverence for those mysterious changes which alter
the very face of life. Eose cried a great deal during
the first few days, and Mrs. Mount ford still went on
performing little acts of devotion, going to look at
her husband's portrait, and thinking of him as a
mournful duty ; but there was a certain excitement
of new existence in both their hearts. So long as he
was there they were bound to Mount, and all the
old habits of their life  indeed never thought of
breaking them, or supposed it possible they could be
broken; but now they were free, and their smiles
came back involuntarily as they prepared for this
exciting removal, the beginning of a new life.
Anne's mind was kept in a graver key by many
causes. The nameless and causeless compunctions,
remorse, which move the sensitive spirit in profound
and awe-stricken sympathy with the dead, were for
her alone in the house. She only tormented herself
with thoughts of other possibilities, of things that
might have been done and were not done ; of words,
nay even looks, which, had she but known how near
her father was to the unseen world, might have been

modified or withheld ; and she only followed him,
halting, uncertain, to the portals of the unseen
existence, as she had followed him to his grave.
What was he doing there ? a man not heavenly, with
qualities that were more suited for the common soil
below than the celestial firmament above. It was
she only who put these questions, not, perhaps as we
have said, that she loved him more, but that she felt
more deeply, and everything that happened was of
more consequence to her. Besides, she had other
causes of gravity. Her position was more serious
altogether. Even the new-made widow had a
straightforward path before her, lonely yet troubled
by no uncertainty  but Anne was walking in darkness,
and did not comprehend her lot.

Of all her surroundings the one who was most
conscious of this was the Eector, who, getting no
satisfaction, as he said, from his son, came out to
Mount himself one of those wintry mornings to
question Anne in person. ' What have they settled ? '
he had asked confidently, as soon as the Curate
returned from the station where he had been seeing

his friend off. ' I don't think they have settled
anything, sir,' said Charley, turning his back upon his
father, not caring to betray more than was needful
of his own feelings. 'They are all going off to
London  that is the only thing that seems to be
decided.' ' God bless my soul ! ' cried the Rector 
which benediction was the good man's oath ; ' but
that has nothing to do with it. I want to know
what is settled about Anne.' Then poor Charley,
out of the excess of his devotion and dissatisfaction,
made a stand for his friend. ' You know, sir, what
a struggle a young barrister has to do anything,' he
said ; ' how can they  settle, when all the money is
gone ? ' ' Grod bless my soul ! ' the Rector said again ;
and after many thoughts he set off to Mount expressly
to have it out, as he said, with Anne herself.
He found her in the library, arranging with old
Saymore what books were to be packed to take away,
while Heathcote Montfort, looking very black and
gloomy, sat at the further window pretending to
read, and biting his nails furiously. The mild old
Rector wondered for a moment what that sullen

figure should have to do in the background, and
why Heathcote did not go and leave his cousins free :
but there was no time then to think of Heathcote,
So you are really going,' the Rector said, ' the
whole family ? It is very early days.'

Mamma thinks it will be better to make the
change at once. She thinks it will do her good,
and Rose '

The Rector fidgeted about the room, pulling
out one here and there of a long line of books,
and pretending to inspect it. Then he said
abruptly, ' The fact was I wanted to speak to you,
Anne.'

Heathcote Montfort was sitting some way off,
and yh\ Ashley's voice was a gentle one  but he

stirred immediately. ' If I am in the way ' he

said, getting up. Of course he was in the way ; but
his faculties must have been very sharp, and his
attention very closely fixed on what was going onto
hear those words. The good Rector murmured
some apology ; but Heathcote strolled away carrying
his book in his hand. It was not so easy to get rid

of old Saymore, who had a thousand questions to
ask ; but he, too, went at last.

'No, we are not taking all the books,' said Anne,
we are taking scarcely anything. My cousin
Heathcote does not wish to refurnish the house at
present, and as we do not know what we may do
eventually, mamma prefers to leave everything. It
is a mutual convenience. In this way we may come
back in summer, when I hope you will be glad to
see us,' she added with a smile.

Of course we shall be glad to see you  I don't
know what we shall do, or how we can get on without
you. But that is not the immediate question
he said, with some energy. ' I have come to ask
you, now that you have seen Douglas, what is settled,
Anne?'

This was the first time the question had been
put formally into words. It gave her a little shock.
The blood all rallied to her heart to give her strength
to answer. She looked him in the face very steadily,
that he might not think she was afraid. ' Settled ? '
she said, with a little air of surprise. ' In present

circumstances, and in our deep mourning, what
could be settled ? We have not even discussed the
question.'

Then I say that is wrong, Anne,' said the Rector
in a querulous voice. 'He is a young man, and I
am an old one, but it is not a question I should
leave undiscussed for an hour. It should be settled
what you are going to do.'

So far it is settled,' she said. ' My duty is with
mamma and Rose.'

What, Anne ! ' cried Mr. Ashley. ' Grod bless
my soul ! You are engaged to be married, and yom-duty
is to your mother and sister? I don't know
what you young people mean.'

Anne did not answer just at once. 'Did not
Charley tell you,' she said, after a pause, ' that we
were all going away ? '

Yes, he told me  and I say nothing against
that. It seems to be the way, now. Instead of
bearing their grief at home, people flee from it as if
it were a plague. Yes, Charley told me ; but he
could not tell me anything about the other question.'

Because there is nothing to tell. Dear Rector,
don't you know my father did leave me a great
legacy, after all '

What was that ? What was that ? Some-think
that was not in the will. I thank God for it,
Anne,' cried Mr. Ashley.  It is the best news I
have heard for many a day.'

Oh, don't speak as if it were something new !
Mr. Ashley, he left me the care of the property, and
the charge of Rose. Can I do whatever I please
with this on my hands ? '

< Is that all?' the Rector said, in a tone of
disappointment ; ' but this is exactly the work in
which Douglas could help you. A man and a barrister,
of course he knows all about it, much better
than you can do. And do you mean to tell me that
nothing has been settled, nothing, Anne ? ' cried Mr.
Ashley, with that vehemence to which mild men are
subject. ' Don't talk to me of your mourning ; I am
not thinking of anything that is to happen to-day
or tomorrow; but is it settled That is what I
want to know.'

'There is nothing settled,' she said  and they
stood there for a minute facing each other, his countenance
full of anxiety and distrust, hers very firm
and pale, almost blank even with determined no-meaning.
She smiled. She would not let him
think she was even disconcerted by his questions.
And the Rector was baffled by this firmness. He
turned away sighing, and wringing his hands. ' Grod
bless my soul I ' he said. For it was no use questioning
Anne any further  that, at least, was very clear.
But as he went away, he came across Heathcote
Montfort who was walking about in the now
abandoned hall like a handsome discontented ghost.

I am glad to see that you take a great interest
in your cousins,' the Rector said, with a conciliatory
smile. He did not feel very friendly, to tell the
truth, towards Heathcote Montfort, feeling that his
existence was a kind of wrong to Anne and Rose ; but
yet he was the new lord of the manor, and this is a
thing which the spiritual head of a parish is bound to
remember, whatever his personal feelings may be.
Even in this point of view, however, Heathcote was

unsatisfactory  for a poor lord of the manor in the
best of circumstances is a trial to a rector, especially
one who has been used to a well-to-do squire with
liberal ways.

My interest is not of much use,' Heathcote said,.
for you see, though I have protested, they are going
away.'

Just then Mr. Loseby's phaeton drew up at the
door, and he himself got out, enveloped with greatcoats
and mufflers from head to foot. He was continually
coming and going, with an almost restless
interest in everything that happened at Mount.

It is the very best thing they can do,' he said
Change of scene : it is the remedy for all trouble
now-a-days. They have never seen anything, poor
ladies ; they have been buried in the country all their
lives. And Anne, of course, will like to be in town.
That anyone can see with half an eye.'

Here the Rector found another means, if not of
satisfying his anxious curiosity, at least of sharing
it with some one. He put his arm into Mr. Loseby's
and led him away to the big window. The idea of

at least opening his heart to another friend of the
family did him good. ' Do you know,' he said, with
a gasp of excitement, ' I have been questioning Anne,
and she tells me there is nothing settled  nothing
settled I I could not believe my ears.'

My dear fellow,' said Nlr. Loseby, who was not
reverential, ' what could be settled ? A young couple
with not a penny between them '

We should not have thought of that, Loseby,
in my young days.'

We were fools in our young days,' said the lawyer,
with a laugh  ' inexperienced idiots. That's not the
case now. They all know everything that can
happen, and calculate the eventualities like a parcel
of old women. No, no, the day of imprudent matches
is over. Of course there is nothing settled. I
never expected it for my part '

But  but, Loseby, he could be of such use
to her. They could manage better together than
apart '

And so he will be of use to her ; he's not at alla
bad fellow ; he'll make himself very pleasant to

the whole party. Hell go with them to the opera,
and dine with them three times a week, and be one
in all their little expeditions ; and he'll keep his
chambers and his club all the same, and have no
self-denial forced upon him. He is a most sensible
fellow,' said Mr. Loseby, with a laugh.

The Rector had no great sense of humour. He
looked sternly at the little round man all shining
and smiling. 'Do you mean to tell me,' he said,
severely, ' that you approve of that ? ' but the lawyer
only laughed again, and would make no reply.

And thus the days went on, leaden-footed, yet
getting done one after another, nay, getting shorter,
swifter, as the preparations for departure went on.
Mrs. Montfort did everything that could be expected
of her. She left a sum of money in the
Hector's hands for the usual charities at Christmas,
and all the requirements of the parish ; and she left
instructions with the sexton's wife, who had once
been a housemaid at Mount, and therefore ' took an
interest,' to have a fresh wreath placed on her
husband's grave weekly on the day he died. So

nobody was neglected, living or dead. And their
hearts rose a little as the time of departure drew
near. Cosmo had thrown his whole soul into the
work of house-hunting. And he had found them,
which was the most wonderful luck, a small house
in Park Lane, which was too dear, Mrs. Montfort
thought, yet so cheap as to be almost incredible to
anyone who knew what Park Lane was. Even Anne
felt a little exhilaration at the thought of windows
which should look out upon the Park under the red
wintry sunshine, and of all the sights and wonders
that would be within reach.

All this time Heathcote 'stayed on. It was very
bad taste, some people thought ; and very silly, said
other some. Yet still he remained. Of course it
must be Rose that was the inducement, Anne being
known to be engaged ; and Fanny Woodhead did not
hesitate to say that she really thought the man had
no sense whatever of what was fitting, to stay on, and
stay on, until the very last moment. But the household
themselves did not object. They had got used
to Heathcote. Even Anne liked him at those times

VOL. II. T

when he did not look as if he were sitting in judgment
upon Cosmo. Sometimes this was his aspect,
and then she could not bear him. But generally he
was very supportable. ' You forget I live in London,
too,* he said. * I mean to see a great deal of you
there. You may as well let me stay and take care
of you on the journey.' And Mrs. Montfort liked
the proposal. For purposes of travelling and general
creaking she believed in men, and thought these
among their principal uses. She even went so far
as to say, 'We shall be very well off in London
with Mr. Douglas and your cousin Heathcote : ' so
strangely had everything changed from the time
when St. John Montfort disinherited his daughter
because Cosmo was a nobody. Anne did not know
what to think of this change of sentiment. Sometimes
it seemed to make everything easier, sometimes
to make all further changes impossible. Her heart
beat with the idea of seeing him almost daily, looking
for his constant visits, feeling the chaise of his
companionship round her : and then a mist would
seem to gather between them, and she would foresee

by instinct how Cosmo might, though very near,
become very far. After this she would stop short
and upbraid herself with folly. How could constant
meeting and family companionship make them less
near to each other ? nothing could be more absurd :
and yet the thought  but it was not a thought,
scarcely a feeling, only an instinct  would come
over her and give her a spiritual chill, a check in
all her plans.

Mamma says she thinks we will be very well off
in London,' said Eose, ' and we can go to concerts,
and all those sorts of things. There is nothing in a
concert contrary to mourning. Dances, of course,
and gay parties are out of the question,' she added,
with a slight sigh of regret ; ' but it is just when weare
going to public places that gentlemen are so
useful. You will have your Douglas and I shall
have cousin Heathcote. eve shall be very well
off '

To this Anne made no reply. She was taking
her papers out of the drawers of her writing-table,
arranging them in a large old despatch-box, in which

T 2

they were henceforth to be carried about the world.
Eose came and stood over her curiously, looking at
every little bundle as it was taken out.

I can see Mr. Douglas's writing,' she said.
Have you got a great many letters from Mr.
Douglas, Anne ? ' She put out her hand to touch
one that had strayed out of its place. ' Oh, may I
look at it ? just one little peep. I want so much to
know what a real love-letter is like.'

Anne took her letter up hastily and put it away
with a blush and tremor. These sacred utterances
in Rose's hands would be profanation indeed. ' Wait,
Eosie, she said, ' wait, dear : you will soon have
letters of all kinds  of your very own.'

You mean,' said Eose, ' that now that I am the
rich one people will like me the best ? Anne, why
didn't you give up Mr. Douglas when papa told
you ? I should have, in a moment, if it had been
me ; but I suppose you never thought it would come
to anything. I must say I think you have been
very foolish ; you ought to have given him up, and

then, now, you would have been free to do as you
pleased.'

I did not make any calculations, Rose. Don't
let us talk about it, dear, any more.'

But I want to talk of it. You see now you
never can marry 3Ii'. Douglas at all : so even for
that it was silly of you. And you affronted papa 
you that always were the clever one, the sensible one,
and me the little goose. I can't think how you
could have made such a mistake, Anne !

Anne did not make any answer. The words
were childish, but she felt them like a shower of
stones thrown at her. ' Now you never can marry
Mr. Douglas at all.' Was this how it was going
to be?

Mr. Loseby says,' Rose continued, ' that when I
am of age I ought to make a fresh settlement. He
says it is all wicked, and blames papa instead of you ;
but I think you are certainly to blame too. You
always stand to a thing so, if you have once said it.
A fresh settlement means a new will ; it means that

I am to give you back a large piece of what papa has
left to me.'

'I do not wish you to do so, Eose. If Mr
Loseby had told me first, I should not have let him
speak on such a subject. Eose, remember, you are
not to do it. I do not wish any fresh settlement
made for me.'

If Mr. Loseby says it, and mamma says it, of
course I must do it, whether you consent or not,'
said Eose. ' And, besides, how can you ever marry
Mr. Douglas unless there is a fresh settlement ? Oh,'
cried Eose, ' there is that sealed letter  that secret
that you would not let me open  that is to be kept
till I am twenty-one. Perhaps that will change everything.
Look here ; there are only you and me here,
and I would never tell. I do so want to know what
it is : it might show one what to do if one knew
what was in it. Let me, let me open it, Anne ! '

Eose ! that is sacred. Eose ! you must not
touch it. I will never forgive you if you so much
as break one seal,' cried Anne.

Well, then, do it yourself. What can it matter

if you break it to-day or in two years and a half ?
Papa never could mean that you were to keep it
there and look at it, and never open it for two years
and a half.' All this time Rose turned over andover
the little packet with its three red seals, playing
with it as a cat plays with a mouse. ' Perhaps it
changes everything,' she said ; ' perhaps there is a
new will here without me having to make it. Miy
should we all be kept in such suspense, not knowing
anything, and poor Mr. Douglas made so unhappy ? '

'Did Mr. Douglas tell you that he was unhappy?
' said Anne, humouring her tormentor, while
she kept her eyes upon the letter. ' Dear Rose, put
it back again ; here is the place for it. I have a
great deal to do, and to think of. Don't worry me,
dear, any more.'

Then Rose put it back, but with reluctance. ' If
it were addressed to me I should open it at once,'
she said. ' It is far more important now than it will
be after. Mr. Douglas did not tell me he was unhappy,
but he let mamma guess it, which was much
the same. Anne, if I were you, I would break the

engagement ; I would set him free. It must be
dreadful to hold anyone like that bound up for life.
And when you think  if nothing turns up, if this is
to be the end, if you never have money enough to
marry, why shouldn't you do it now, and give yourselves,
both of you, another chance ? '

Anne rose up from her papers, thrusting them
into the despatch-box pell-mell in the confusion of
her thoughts. The little calm matter-of-fact voice
which sounded so steadily, trilling on like a large
cricket  was it speaking the truth ? was this, perhaps,
what it would have to come to ? Her hands trembled
as she shut the box hastily; her limbs shook
under her. But Rose was no way disturbed. ' You
would be sure to get someone else with more money,*
she said serenely, ' and so would he.'

GOING AWAY.

But this was not the first time that Anne had been
driven out of patience by the suggestions of her little
sister. When Rose had gone away, she calmed down
by degrees and gradually got back her self-possession.
What did Rose know about this matter or any other
matter in which serious things like the heart, like
love and the larger concerns of life were involved ?
She knew about superficial things, having often a
keen power of observation, Anne knew ; but the other
matters were too high for her. Her unawakened
mind could not comprehend them. How could she

VOL. III. B

have found a way of seeing into Cosmo's heart which
was denied to Anne ? It was impossible ; the only
thing that could have made her believe in Rose's
superior penetration was that, Anne felt, she did not
herself understand Cosmo as she had thought she did,
and was perplexed about his course of action, and
anxious as to the motives which she could not believe
to have been anything but fine and noble. Though
his coming had brought her back to something of her
original faith, yet she had been checked and chilled
without admitting it to herself. All that we can
conceive of perfection is, perhaps, what we would
have done ourselves in certain circumstances, or, at
least, what we would have wished to do, what we
might have been capable of in the finest combination
of motives and faculties ; and whatsoever might bethe
glosses with which she explained his behaviour to
herself, Anne knew very well that this was not how
Cosmo had behaved. She could not think of his
conduct as carrying out any ideal, and here accordingly
was the point in which her mind was weak and
subject to attack. But after a while she laughed,

or tried to laugh, at herself; 'as if Eose could
know ! ' she said, and settled down to arrange her
papers again, and finally to write to Cosmo, which
was her way of working off her fright and returning
to herself.

Eose has been talking to me and advising me,'
she wrote. ' She has been telling me what I ought
to do. And the chief point of all is about you. She
thinks, as we are both poor now, that I ought to
release you from our engagement, and so " give us
both another chance," as she says. It is wonderful
the worldly wisdom that is in my little sister. She
thinks that you and I could both use this " chance "
to our own advantage, and find someone else who is
well off as a fitter mate for our respective poverties.
Is it the spirit of the time of which we all hear so
much, that suggests wisdom like this even in the
nursery ? It makes me open my eyes and feel myself
a fool. And she does it all in such innocence, with
her dear little chin turned up, and everything about
her so smooth and childlike ; she suggests these
villanies with the air of a good little girl saying her

B 2

lesson. I cannot be sure that it amused me, for
you know I am always a little, as you say, au grand
series ; but for you who have a sense of humour
am afraid it would be very amusing. I wonder, if
the people she advises for their good, took Rose at
her word, whether she would be horrified ? I hope
and believe she would. And as for you, Cosmo, I
trust you will let me know when you want to be
freed from your engagement. I am afraid it would
take that to convince me. I cannot think of you
even, from any level but your own, and, as that is
above mine, how could it be comprehensible to
Rose ? This calculation would want trigonometry
(is not that the science ?), altogether out of my
power. Give me a hint from yourself, dear Cosmo,
when that moment arrives. I shall know you have
such a motive for it as will make it worthy of you.'

When she had written this she was relieved :
though perhaps the letter might never be sent to its
address. In this way her desk was full of scraps
which she had written to Cosmo for the relief of
her mind rather than the instruction of his. Perhaps,

if her confidence in him had been as perfect as
she thought, she would have sent them all to him.
They were all appeals to the ideal Cosmo who was her
real lover, confidences in him, references to his
understanding and sympathy, which never would
have failed had he been what she thought. This had
been the charm and delight of her first and earliest
abandonment of heart and soul to her love. But as
one crisis came after another, or rather since the last
crisis came which had supplied such cruel tests,
Anne had grown timid of letting all these outpourings
reach his eyes ; though she continued to
write them all the same, and they relieved her own
heart. When she had done this now, her mind
regained its serenity. What a wonder was little
Eose ! Where had the child learned all that ' store
of petty maxims,' all those suggestions of prudence ?
Anne smiled to herself with the indulgence which
we all have for a child. Some people of a rough
kind are amused by hearing blasphemies, oaths which
have no meaning as said by her, come out of a
child's lips. It was with something of the same

kind of feeling that Anne received her little sister's
recommendations. They did not amuse her indeed,
but yet impressed her as something ludicrous, less to
be blamed than to be smiled at, not calling forth
any real exercise of judgment, nor to be considered
as things serious enough to be judged at all.

The packing up. kept the house in commotion,
and it was curious how little feeling there was, how
little of the desolation of parting, the sense of breaking
up a long-established home. The pleasure of
freedom and expectations of a new life were great
even with Mrs. Montfort : and Rose's little decorous
sorrow had long ago worked itself out. ' Some
natural tears she dropped, but wiped them soon.'
And it did not give these ladies any great pang to
leave Mount. They were not leaving it really, they
said to themselves. So long as the furniture was
there, which was Mrs. Montfort's, it was still their
house, though the walls of it belonged to Heath-cote
 and then, if Heathcote ' came forward,' as

Mrs. Montfort, at least, believed he would do .

Rose did not think anything at all about this. At

first, no doubt, it had appeared to her as rather t
triumph, to win the affections of the heir of entail
and to have it in her power to assume the position of
head of the house, as her mother had done. But, as
the sniff of the freshening breeze came to her from
the unseen seas on which she was about to launch
forth, Eose began to feel more disdain than pleasure
for such easy triumphs. Cousin Heathcote was
handsome, but he was elderly  thirty-five! and she
was only eighteen. No doubt there were finer
things in the unknown than any she had yet caught
sight of; and what was Mount ? a mere simple
country house, not half so grand as Meadowlands- -
that the possible possession of it in the future should
so much please a rich girl with a good fortune and
everything in her favour. Leaving home did not
really count for much in her mind, as she made her
little individual preparations. The future seemed
her own, the past was not important one way or
another. And having given her sister the benefit of
her advice with such decision, she felt herself still
more able to advise Keziah, who cried as she put

up Miss Eose's things. On the whole, perhaps, there
was more fellowship between Keziah and Rose than
the little maid felt with the more serious Anne, who
was so much older than herself, though the same
age.

I would not have married Saymore if I had been
you,' said Rose. ' You will never know anything
more than Hunston all your life now, Keziah. You
should have come with me into the world. At
Mount, or in a little country place, how could you
ever see anybody ? You have had no choice at all
Jim, whom you never could have married, and
now old Saymore. I suppose your aunt thinks it is
a great thing for you  but I don't think it a great
thing. If you had come with us, you might have
done so much better. I wish you had consulted
me '

So do I, Miss Rose,' said Keziah, dropping
tears into the box, which, fortunately, contained
only boots and shoes, and articles which would not
mark. ' Oh ! I wish I had talked to you at the
very first! but I was distracted like, Miss Rose

about poor Jim, and I couldn't think of anything
else.'

That was nonsense,' said Eose ; ' that was always
quite out of the question; how could you have
married a poor labourer after having been used to
live with us, and have every comfort? It would
have killed you, Keziah ; you were never very strong,
you know ; and only think ! you that have had fires
in your room, and nice luncheons three or four times
a day, how could you ever live upon a bit of bacon
and weak tea, like the women in the cottages? You
never could have married him.'

That is what aunt used to tell me,' said Keziah
faintly ; ' she said I should have been the first to
repent ; but then Miss Anne '

Oh, never mind Miss Anne  she is so romantic.
She never thinks about bread and butter,' said Eose.
Jim is out of the question, and there is no use
thinking of him ; but old Saymore is just as bad,'
said the little oracle ; ' I am not sure that he isn't
the worst of the two.'

Do you think so, Miss Eose ? ' said Keziah

wistfully. It was an ease to her mind to have her
allegiance to Jim spoken of so lightly. Anne had
treated it as a solemn matter, as if it were criminal
to ' break it off ; ' whereas Keziah's feeling was that
she had a full right to choose for herself in the
matter. But old Saymore was a different question.
If she could have had the Black Bull without him,
no doubt it would have been much better. And
now here was a rainbow glimmer of possible glories
better even than the Black Bull passing over her
path ! She looked up with tears in her eyes. Something
pricked her for her disloyalty to Miss Anne,
but Miss Rose was ' more comforting like.' Perhaps
this wiser counsellor would even yet see some solution
to the question, so that poor old Saymore might
be left out of it.'

I think,' said Rose with decision, * that suppose
I had been engaged to anyone, when I left Mount, I
should have given it up. I should have said, " I am
going into the world. I don't know what may be
best now ; things will be so very different. Of
course, I don't want to be disagreeable, but I must

do the best for myself." And anybody of sense
would have seen it and consented to it,' said Eose.
 Of course you must always do the best you can
for yourself.'

Yes, Miss Eose,' said Keziah. This chimed with
her own profoundest instincts. * But then there's
mother and the boys. Mother was to be in the
kitchen, and Johnny in the stable, and little Tom
bred up for a waiter. It was setting them all up in
the world, aunt said.'

All that may be very well,' said Eose. ' Of
course it is always right to be kind to your mother
and the rest. But remember that your first duty is
always to yourself. And if you like to come with
me, I am to have a maid all to myself, Keziah ; and
you would soon find someone better than old Say-more,
if you wanted to marry. You may be very
sure of that.'

With this Eose marched away, very certain that
she had given the best of advice to the little maid.
But Keziah remained doubtful, weeping freely into
the trunk which held the boots and shoes. After

all there remained ' mother and the boys ' to think
of, who would not be bettered by any such means of
doing the best for herself as Rose had pointed out
Keziah thought, perhaps it would be better after all
to submit the question once more to Miss Anne,,
before her final decision was given forth.

The other servants were affected by the breaking
up more in Keziah's way than with any dismal
realisation in their own persons of a conclusion ta
this chapter of life. They had all ' characters ' that
would procure them new places wherever they went ;
for Mrs. Montfort had not tolerated any black
sheep. And as for old Saymore, he was greatly elated
by his approaching land lordship, and the marriage-which
he hoped was settled. He was not aware of
Eose's interference, nor of the superior hopes which
she had dangled before his bride. ' I don't need to-say
as I'm sorry to leave, sir,' Saymore said to Mr
Loseby, who settled his last bills ; ' and sorry, very
sorry, for the occasion. Master was a gentleman as-seemed
to have many years' life in him, and to be cutoff
like that is a lesson to us all. But the living haste

think of themselves, sir, when all's done as can be
-done to show respect for the dead. And I don't
know as I could have had a finer opening. I will
miss a deal as I've had here, Mr. Loseby. The
young ladies I'll ever take the deepest interest in.
I've seen 'em grow up, and it'll always be a 'happiness
to see them, and you too, sir, as has always been most
civil, at my 'hotel. But though there's a deal to
regret, there's something on the other side to be
thankful for, and we're told as everything works
together for the best.'

This was the idea very strong in the mind of the
house. As the landlord of the Black Bull holds a
higher position in the world than even the most
trusted of butlers, so the position of Mrs. Cook, as
henceforward housekeeper and virtual mistress of
Mount, was more dignified than when she was only
sit the head of the kitchen : and Worth, if she did
not gain in dignity, had at least the same compensation
as her mistress, and looked forward to seeing
the world, and having a great deal of variety in her
life. They all said piously that everything worked

together for the best. So that poor Mr. Montfort
was the cause of a great deal of gratification to his
fellow-creatures without knowing or meaning it, when
his horse put his foot into that rabbit-hole. The
harm he did his favourite child scarcely counted as
against the advantage he did to many of his dependents.
Such are the compensations in death as in
life.

But it was December before they got away. After
all it turned out that 'mother and the boys' had
more weight with Keziah than Eose's offer, and the
promise of superior advantage in the future ; and
she was left in the cottage she came from, preparing
her wedding things, and learning by daily experiment
how impossible it would have been to content
herself with a similar cottage, weak tea, bad butter,
and fat bacon, instead of the liberal regime of the
servants' hall, which Eose had freely and graphically
described as meaning ' three or four nice luncheons
a day.' The Mountfords finally departed with very
little sentiment ; everything was provided for, even
the weekly wreath on the grave, and there was nothing

for anyone to reproach herself with. Anne, as usual,
was the one who felt the separation most. She was
going to Cosmo's constant society, and to the enjoyment
of many things she had pined for all her life.
Yet the visionary wrench, the total rending asunder
of life and all that was implied in it, affected her
more than she could say, more than, in the calm of
the others, there seemed any reason for. She went
out the day before for a long farewell walk, while
Eose was still superintending her packing. Anne
made a long round through the people in the village,
glad that the women should cry, and that there
should be some sign here at least of more natural
sentiment  and into the Rectory, where she penetrated
to the Rector's study, and was standing by
him with her hand upon his arm before he was
aware. 'I have come to say good-bye,' she said
looking at him with a smile, yet tears in her
eyes.

The Rector rose to his feet hastily and took her
into his arms. ' Grod bless you, my dear child ! but
you might have been sure I would have come to seethe

last of you, to bid you farewell at the carriage
"door '

'Yes,' said Anne, clinging to her old friend, 'but
that is not like good-bye here, is it ? where I have
always been allowed to come to you, all my life.'

And always shall ! ' cried the Eector, ' whenever
you want me, howsoever I can be of any use to you ! '

The Curate came in while they were still clinging
to each other, talking, as people will do when
their hearts are full, of one who was no longer thereto
be bidden good-bye to  the Rector's wife, for
whom he went mourning always, and who had been
fond of Anne. Thus she said her farewell both to
the living and the dead. Charley walked solemnly
by her side up to the park gates. He did not say
much ; his heart was as heavy as lead in his breast.
*I don't know how the world is to go on without
you,' he said ; ' but I suppose it will, all the same.'

After a while it will not make much difference,'
said Anne.

I suppose nothing makes much difference after
a while,' the Curate said ; and at the park gates he

said good-bye. * I shall be at the train tomorrow 
but you don't want me to go to all the other places
with you,' he said with a sigh ; ' and it is of no use
telling you, Anne, as my father did, that, night or
day, I am at your service whenever you may want
me  you know that.'

Yes, I know it,' she said, giving him her hand ;
but she was glad that he left her free to visit some
other sacred places alone.

Then, as he went back drearily to the parish in
which lay all his duty, his work in the world, but
which would be so melancholy with Mount shut up
and silent, she went lightly over the frosty grass,
which crackled under her feet, to the beeches, to
visit them once more and think of her tryst under
them. How different they were now ! She remembered
the soft air of summer, the full greenness of
the foliage, the sounds of voices all charmed and
sweet with the genial heat of August. How different
now ! Everything at her feet lay frost-bound ; the
naked branches overhead were white with rime.
Nothing was stirring in the wintry world about save

VOL. III. c

the blue smoke from the house curling lazily far ois
through the anatomy of the leafless trees. This was
where she had sat with Cosmo talking, as if talk
would never have an end. As she stood reflecting
over this with a certain sadness, not sure, though
she should see Cosmo tomorrow, that she ever would
talk again as she had talked then pouring forth the
whole of her heart  Anne was aware of a step not
far off crackling upon a fallen branch. She turned
round hastily and saw Heathcote coming towards
her. It was not a pleasant surprise.

You are saying good-bye,' he said, ' and I aman
intruder. Pardon me ; I strayed this way by
accident '

Never mind,' said Anne ; ' yes, I am saying
good-bye.'

Which is the last word you should say, with
my will.'

Thanks, cousin Heathcote, you are very good.
I know how kind you have been. If I seem to be
ungrateful,' said Anne, ' it is not that I don't feel it,
but only that my heart is full.'

I know that,' he said, ' very well. I was not
asking any gratitude. The only thing that I feel I
have a right to do is to grumble, because everything
was settled, everything ! before I had a chance.'

That is your joke,' said Anne, with a smile ;
and then, after a time, she added, ' Will you take
me to the spot as far as you remember it, the very
spot '

I know,' he said ; and they went away solemnly
side by side, away from that spot consecrated to love
and all its hopeful memories, crossing together the
crisp ice-bound grass. The old house rose up in
front of them against the background of earth and
sky, amid the clustering darkness of the leafless
branches. It was all silent, nothing visible of the
life within, except the blue smoke rising faintly
through the air, which was so still. They said
little as they went along by the great terrace and the
lime avenue, avoiding the flower-garden, now so bare
and brown. The winter's chill had paralysed everything.
' The old house will be still a little more sad
tomorrow,' Heathcote said.

c 2

I don't think it ought to be. You have not
the affection for it which you might have had,
had you known it better: but some time or
other it will blossom for you and begin another
life.'

He shook his head. ' May I bring Edward to see
you in Park Lane ? Edward is my other life,' he
said, ' and you will see how little strength there
is in that.'

But, cousin Heathcote, you must not speak so.
Why should you ? You are young ; life is all before
a man at your age.'

Who told you that ? ' he said with a smile
That is one of your feminine delusions. An old
fellow of thirty-five, when he is an old fellow, is as
old as Methuselah, Anne. He has seen everything
and exhausted everything. This is the true age at
which all is vanity. If he catches at a new interest
and begins to hope for a renewal of his hear, something
is sure to come in and stop him. He is frustrated
and all his opportunities baulked as in my
own case  or something else happens. I know

sou think a great deal more of our privileges than
they deserve.'

We are taught to do so,' said Anne. ' We are
taught that all our best time is when we are young,
but that it is different with a man. A man, so to
speak, never grows old.'

One knows what that means. He is supposed
to be able to marry at any age. And so he is-somebody.
But, if you will reflect, few men want
to marry in the abstract. They want to marry one
individual person, who, so far as my experience goes,
is very often, most generally I should say, not for
them. Do you think it is a consolation for the man
who wants to marry Ethelinda, that probably Wal-burghs
might have him if he asked her ? I don't
see it. You see how severely historical I am in my
names.'

They are both Montfort names,' said Anne,
*but very severe  archaeological, rather than historical.'
And then they came out on the other side
and were silent, coming to the broad stretch of the
park on which Mr. Montfort's accident took place.

They walked along very silently with a sort of
mournful fellowship between them. So far as this
went there was nobody in the world with whom Anne
could feel so much in common. His mind was full
of melancholy recollections as he walked along the
crisp and crackling grass. He seemed to see the
quiet evening shadows, the lights in the windows
and to hear the tranquil voice of the father of the
family pointing out the welcome which the old
house seemed to give : and then the stumble, the
fall, the cry ; and the long long watch in the dark,
so near help  the struggles of the horse  the stillness
of the huddled heap which could scarcely be
identified from the horse, in the fatal gloom. When
they came to the spot they stood still, as over a
grave. There were still some marks of the horse's
frantic hoofs in the heavy grass.

Was it long ? ' he said. ' The time seemed
years to me  but I suppose it was not an hour.'

*They thought only about half-an-hour,' said
Anne, in a low reverential voice.

A few minutes were enough,' Heathcote said



and again there was a silence. He took her hand,
scarcely knowing what he did.

We are almost strangers,' he said ; ' but this
one recollection will bind us together, will it not, for
all our lives ? '

Anne gave a soft pressure to his hand, partly in
reply, partly in gratitude. Her eyes were full of
tears, her voice choked. ' I hope he had no time to
think,' she said.

A moment, but no more. I feel sure that after
that first cry, and one groan, there was no more.'

She put down her veil and wept silently as they
went back to the house. Mrs. Montfort all the
time was sitting with Rose in her bedroom watching
Worth as she packed all the favourite knickknacks,
which make a lady's chamber pretty and homelike.
She liked to carry these trifles about, and she was
interested and anxious about their careful packing.
Thus it was only the daughter whom he had wronged
who thought of the dead father on the last day which
the family spent at Mount.

CHAPTER XXVII.

A NEW BEGINNING.

For people who are well off, not to say rich, and
who have no prevailing anxieties to embitter their
life, and who take an interest in what is going on
around them, London is a pleasant place enough,
even in December. And still more is Park Lane a
pleasant place. To see the red wintry sunshine
lighting up the misty expanse of the Park, the
brisk pedestrians going to and fro under the bare
trees, the carriages following each other along the
broad road, the coveys of pretty children and neat
nurseries, and all the flood of prosperous life that
flows along, leisurely in the morning, crowding in
the afternoons, is very pleasant to the uninitiated.
All the notable people that are to be found in
London at that period, appearing now and then.

and a great many people who get lost to sight in the
throngs of the season, but are more worth seeing
than even those throngs, were pointed out to the
ladies by the two cicerones who took in hand to
enlighten their ignorance. The house they had was
one of those small houses with large, ample, bow
windows to the di-awing-rooms, which give a sort of
rustic, irregular simplicity to this street of the rich.
Those people who are happy and well off and live
in Park Lane must be happier and more well off
than people anywhere else. They must be amused
besides, which is no small addition to happiness.
Even Anne felt that to sit at that window all day
long would be a pleasant way of occupying a day.
The misty distance, penetrated by the red rays of
sunshine, was a kind of poem, relieved by the active
novelty of the animated foreground, the busy passengers,
the flood and high tide of life. How different
from the prospect over the park at Mount, where
Charley Ashley on the road, coming up from the
Kectory, was something to look at, and an occasional
friend with him the height of excitement. The

red rays made the mist brighter and brighter ; the
crowd increased ; the carriages went faster ; and then
the sun waned and got low and went out in a bank
of cloud, and the lamps were all lighted in the misty-twilight,
but still the crowd went on. The ladies
sat at the window and were amused, as by a scene ina
play ; and then to think that ' all the pictures,' by
which Anne meant the National Gallery, were within
reach  and many another wonder, of which they
had been able to snatch a hasty glance once a
year, or not so often as once a year, but which was
now daily at their hand : and even, last, but yet
important, the shops behind all, in which everything
that was interesting was to be found. Rose and her
mother used to like, when they had nothing better
and more important to buy, to go to the Japanese
shop, and turn over the quaint articles there. Everything
was new to them, as if they had come from
the South Seas. But the newest of all was this power
of doing something whenever they pleased, finding
something to look at, something to hear, something
to buy. The power of shopping is in itself an endless

delight to country ladies. Nothing to do but
to walk into a beautiful big place, with obsequious
people ready to bring you whatever you might want
graceful young women putting on every variety of
mantle to please you, bland men unfolding the
prettiest stuffs, the most charming dresses. The
amusement thus afforded was unending. Even
Anne liked it, though she was so high flown. Very
different from the misty walk through their own
park to ask after some sick child, or buy postage
stamps at the village post-office. This was about
all that could be done at Mount. But London was
endless in its variety. And then there was sightseeing
such as never could be managed when people
came up to town only for a month in the season.
Mr. Montfort indeed had been impatient at the
mere idea that his family wanted to see St. Paul's
and the Tower, like rustics come to town for a holiday.
Now they were free to do all this with nobody
to interfere.

And it was Cosmo who was their guide, philosopher
and friend in this new career. He had

chosen their house for them, with which they were
all so entirely pleased, and it was astonishing how
often he found leisure to go with them here and
there, explaining to them that his work was capable
oi being done chiefly in the morning, and that those
afternoon hours were not good for much. ' Besides,
you know the time of a briefless barrister is never of
much importance,' he said, with a laugh. Rose was
very curious on this point. She questioned him a
great deal more closely than Anne would have done.
Are you really a briefless barrister, Mr. Douglas ?
What is a briefless barrister ? Does that mean that
you have no work at all to do ? ' she said.

Not very much. Sometimes I am junior with
some great man who gets all the fees and all the
reputation. Sometimes an honest, trustful individual,
with a wrong to be redressed, comes to ask
my advice. This happens now and then, just to
keep me from giving in altogether. It is enough to
swear by, that is about all,' he said.

Then it is not enough to live on,' said Rose,
.pushing her inquiries to the verge of rudeness. But

Cosmo was not offended. He was indulgent to her
curiosity of every kind.

No, not near enough to live on. I get other
little things to do, you know  sometimes I write a
little for the newspapers  sometimes I have a report
to write or an inquiry to conduct. And sometimes
a kind lady, a friend to the poor, will ask me out to
dinner,' he said, with a laugh. They were sitting at
dinner while this conversation was going on.

But then, how could you ? ' Rose began,.

then stopped short, and looked at her sister. ' I
will ask you that afterwards,' she said.

Now or afterwards, your interest does me
honour, and I shall do""my best to satisfy you,' said
Cosmo, with a bow of mock submission. He was
more light-hearted, Anne thought, than she had ever
seen him before ; and she was a little surprised by
the amount of leisure he seemed to have. She had
formed no idea of the easy life of the class of so-called
poor men to which Cosmo belonged. According
to her ideas they were all toiling, lying in wait
for Fortune, working early and late, and letting no

opportunity slip. She could have understood the
patience, the weariness, the obstinate struggle of
such lives ; but she could not understand how, being
poor, they could get on so comfortably, and with so
little strain, with leisure for everything that came
in the way, and so many little luxuries. Anne was
surprised by the fact that Cosmo could bestow his
afternoons upon their little expeditions, and go to
the club when he left them, and be present at all the
theatres when anything of importance was going on,
and altogether show so little trace of the pressure
which she supposed his work could not fail to make
upon him. He seemed indeed to have fewer claims
upon his time than she herself had. Sometimes she
was unable to go out with the others, having letters
from Mr. Loseby to answer, or affairs of the estate
to look after ; but Cosmo's engagements were less
pressing. How was it? she asked herself. Surely
it was not in this way that men got to be Judges,
Lord Chancellors  all those great posts which had
been in Anne's mind since first she knew that her
lover belonged to the profession of the law. That

lie must be aspiring to these heights seemed to her
inevitable  and especially now, when she had lost
all her money, and there was no possible means of
union for them, save in his success. But could
success be won so easily ? Was it by such simple
means that men got to the top of the tree, or even
reached as far as offices which were not the
highest ?

These questions began to meet and bewilder her
Tery soon after their arrival, after the first pleasure
of falling into easy constant intercourse with the
man who loved her and whom she loved.

At first it had been but too pleasant to see him
continually, to get acquainted with the new world
in which they were living, through his means, and
to admire his knowledge of everything  all the
people and all their histories. But by-and-by
Anne's mind began to get bewildered. She was
only a woman and did not understand  nay, only a
girl, and had no experience. Perhaps, it was possible
men got through their work by such a tremendous
effort of power that the strain could only be kept up

for a short period of time ; perhaps Cosmo was one
of those wonderful people who accomplish much
without ever seeming to be employed at all ; perhaps
and this she felt was the most likely guess it
was her ignorance that did not understand anything
about the working of an accomplished mind, but
expected everything to go on in the jog-trot round
of labour which was all she understood. Happy are
the women who are content to think that all is well
which they are told is well  and who can believe in
their own ignorance and be confident in the better
knowledge of the higher beings with whom they are
connected. Anne could not do this  she abode as
in a city of refuge in her own ignorance, and trusted
in that to the fullest extent of her powers  but still
her mind was confused and bewildered. She could
not make it out. At the same time, however, she
was quite incapable of Rose's easy questioning. She
could not take Cosmo to task for his leisure, and
ask him how he was employing it. When she heard
her little sister's interrogations she was half alarmed
half horrified. Fools rush in  she did not say this

to herself, but something like it was in her
thoughts.

After this particular dinner, however, Eose kept
to her design very steadily. She beckoned Cosmo
to come to her when he came upstairs. Eose's rise
into importance since her fathers death had been
one of the most curious incidents in the family
history. It was not that she encroached upon the
sphere of Anne, who was supreme in the house as
she had always been  almost more supreme now, as
having the serious business in her hands ; nor was
she disobedient to her mother, who, on her side, was
conscientiously anxious not to spoil the little heiress,
or allow her head to be turned by her elevation.
But Eose had risen somehow, no one could tell how.
She was on the top of the wave  the successfulness
of success was in her veins, exhilarating her, calling
forth all her powers. Anne, though she had taken
her own deposition with so much magnanimity, had
yet been somewhat changed and subdued by it.
The gentle imperiousness of her character, sympathetic
yet naturally dominant, had been already

VOL. III. D

checked by these reverses. She had been stopped
short in her life, and made to pause and ask of the
world and the unseen those questions which, when
once introduced into existence, make it impossible
to go on with the same confidence and straightforward
rapidity again. But little Eose was full of
confidence and curiosity and faith in herself. She
did not hesitate either in advising or questioning the
people around her. She had told Anne what she
ought to do  and now she meant to tell Cosmo.
She had no doubt whatever as to her competence
for it, and she liked the role.

Come and sit here beside me,' she said. ' 1 am
going to ask you a great many questions. Was that
all true that you told me at dinner, or was it your
fun ? Please tell me in earnest this time. I want
so very much to know.'

It would have been poor fun ; not much of a
joke, I think. No, it was quite true.'

All of it ? About writing in the newspapers,
and one person asking your advice once in a way ?
And about ladies asking you out to dinner ? '

'Perhaps that would be a little too matter-office.
I have always had enough to pay for my
dinner. Yes, I think I can say that much,' said
Cosmo, with a laugh.

But that does not make very much difference,'
said Rose. 'Well, then, now I must ask you
another question. How did you think, Mr. Douglas,
that you could marry Anne ? '

She spoke low, so that nobody else could hear,
and looked him full in the face, with her seeming
innocence. The question was so unexpected, and the
questioner so unlike a person entitled to institute
such examinations, that Cosmo was entirely taken by
surprise. He gave an almost ga;-p of amazement
and consternation, and though he was not easily put
out, his countenance grew crimson.

How did I think I could ? You put a very

startling question. I always knew I was entirely
unworthy,' he stammered out.

But that isn't what I meant a bit. Anne is
awfully superior,' said Rose. ' I always knew she
was  but more than ever now. I am not asking you

D 2

how you ventured to ask her, or anything of that
sort  but how did you think that you could marry 
when you had only enough to be sure of paying for
your own dinner ? And I don't mean either just at
first, for of course you thought she would be rich.
But when you knew that papa was so angry, and
that everything was so changed for her, how could
you think you could go on with it ? It is that that
puzzles me so.'

Rose was seated in a low chair, busy with a piece
of crewel work, from which she only raised her eyes
now and then to look him in the face with that
little matter-of-fact air, leaving him no loophole of
sentiment to escape by. And he had taken another
seat on a higher elevation, and had been stooping
over her with a smile on his face, so altogether unsuspicious
of any attack that he had actually no
possibility of escape. Her half-childish look paralysed
him : it was all he could do not to gape at her
with open mouth of bewilderment and confusion.
But her sepech was a long one, and gave him a
little time to get up his courage.

I

You are very right,' he said. ' I did not think
you had so much judgment. How could I think of
it  I cannot tell. It is presumption ; it is wretched
injustice to her  to think of dragging her down into
my poverty.'

but you don't seem a bit poor, Mr. Douglas;
that is the funny thing  and you are not very busy
or working very hard. I think it would all be very
nice for you, and very comfortable. But I cannot
see, for my part,' said the girl, tranquilly, ' what you
would do with Anne.'

Those are questions which we do not discuss '

he was going to say ' with little girls,' being angry ;
but he paused in time  ' I mean which we can only
discuss, Anne and I, between ourselves.'

Oh, Anne ! she would never mind ! ' said Rose,
with a certain contempt.

What is it that Anne would never mind ? ' said
Mrs. Montfort. Anne was out of the room, and
had not even seen this curious inquisition into the
meaning of her betrothed.

Nothing at all that is prudent, mamma. I was

asking Mr. Douglas how he ever thought he would
be able to get married, living such an easy life.'

Eose, are you out of your refuses ?' cried her
mother, in alarm. ' You will not mind her, Mr.
Douglas, she is only a child  and I am afraid she
has been spoiled of late. Anne has always spoiled
her : and since her dear papa has been gone, who
kept us all right '

Here Mrs. Montfort put her handkerchief
lightly to her eyes. It was her tribute to the occasion.
On the whole she was finding her life very
pleasant, and the pressure of the cambric to her eyelids
was the little easy blackmail to sorrow which she
habitually paid.

She asks very pertinent questions,' said Cosmo,
getting up from the stool of repentance upon which
he had been placed, with something between a smile
and a sigh.

She always had a great deal of sense, though
she is such a child,' said her mother fondly ; ' but,
my darling, you must learn that you really cannot

be allowed to meddle with things that don't concern
you. People always know their own affairs best.'

At this moment Anne came back. When the
subject of a discussion suddenly enters the place in
which it has been going on, it is strange how foolish
everybody looks, and what a sense of wrong-doing is
generally diffused in the atmosphere. They had
been three together to talk, and she was but one.
Cosmo, who, whatever he might do, or hesitate to do,
had always the sense in him of what was best, the
perception of moral beauty and ideal grace which
the others wanted, looked at her as she came across
the room with such compunctious tenderness in
his eyes as the truest lover in existence could not
have surpassed. He admired and loved her, it
seemed to him, more than he ever did before. And
Anne surprised this look of renewed and half-adoring
love. It went through and through her like a
sudden warm glow of sunshine, enveloping her in
sudden warmth and consolation. What a wonderful
glory, what a help and encouragement in life, to beloved
like that ! She smiled at him with the tenderest

gratitude. Though there might be things in
which he fell below the old ideal Cosmo, to whom all
those scraps of letters in her desk had been addressed,
still life had great gladness in it which had this
Cosmo to fall back upon. She returned to that
favourite expression, which sometimes lately she had
refrained even from thinking of, and with a glance
called him to her, which she had done very little of
late. ' I want your advice about Mr. Loseby's letter,'
she said. And thus the first result of Rose's cross-examination
was to bring the two closer to each
other. They went together into the inner room,
where Anne had her writing-table and all her business
papers, and where they sat and discussed Mr.
Loseby's plans for the employment of money. ' I
would rather, far rather, do something for the
estate with it,' Anne said. ' Those cottages ! my
father would have consented to have them; and
Eose always took an interest in them, almost as
great an interest as I did. She will be so well off,
what does it matter ? Comfort to those poor people
is of far more importance than a little additional

mon-y in the bank, for that is what it comes to  not
even money to spend, we have plenty of that.'

You do not seem to think that all this should
have been for yourself, Anne. Is it possible ? It is
more than I could have believed.'

Dear Cosmo,' said Anne, apologetically, ' you
know I have never known what it is to be poor. I
don't understand it. I am intellectually convinced,
you know, that I am a beggar, and Eose has everything
; bat otherwise it does not have the slightest
effect upon me. I don't understand it. No, I am
not a beggar. I have five hundred a year.'

Till that little girl comes of age,' he said, with
an accent of irritation which alarmed Anne. She
laid her soft hand upon his to calm him.

You like Eose well enough, Cosmo ; you have
been so kind to her, taking them everywhere.
Don't be angry, it is not her fault.'

'No, it is my fault,' he said. 'I am at the
bottom of all the mischief. It is I who have spoiled
your life. She has been talking to me, that child,
and with the most perfect reason. She says how

could I think of marrying Anne if I was so poor ?
She is quite right, my dearest ; how could I think
of marrying you, of throwing m} shadow across your
beautiful, bright, prosperous life ? '

For that matter,' said Anne, with a soft laugh,
'you did not, Cosmo  you only thought of loving
me. You are like the father in the "Precious
Ridicules," do you remember, who so shocked everybody
by coming brutally to marriage at once. That,
after all, has not so much to do with it. Scores of
people have to wait for years and years. In the meantime
the pai/s de tendre is very sweet ; don't you think
so ? ' she said, turning to him soft eyes which were
swimming in a kind of dew of light, liquid brightness
and happiness, like a glow of sunshine in them.
What could Cosmo do or say ? He protested that it
was very sweet, but not enough. That nothing
would be enough till he could carry her away to the
home which should be hers and his, and where nobody
would intermeddle. And Anne was as happy
as if her lover, speaking so earnestly, had been transformed

at once into the hero and sage, high embodiment
of man in all the nobleness of which man is
capable, which it was the first necessity of her happiness
that he should be.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

heath cote's career.

Heathcote Montfort went with his cousins to
London, and when he had taken them to their
house, returned to his chambers in the Albany.
They were very nice rooms. I do not know why an
unmarried man's lodging should be called chambers,
but it does not make them at all different from
other rooms which are not dignified by that name.
They were very comfortable, but not very orderly,
with numbers of books about, and a boot or two
now and then straying where it had no right to be,
but also with the necessary curiosities and prettiness
which are now part of the existence of every
well-bred person, though these were not shown off
to the full advantage, but lost among a good deal of
litter scattered here and there. He was not a man

who put his best foot foremost in any way, but let
this treasures lie about, and permitted this own capacities
and high qualities to go to rust under the
outside covering of indifference and do-nothingness.
It had never been necessary to him to do anything.
He had very little ambition, and whatever zeal for
enjoyment had been in his life, had been satisfied
and was over. He had wandered over a great part of
the earth, and noticed many things in a languid way,
and then he had come home and gone to his chambers,
and, unpacking the treasures which, like everybody
else, he had taken some trouble to ' pick up '
here and there, suffered them to lie about among all
sorts of trifling things. He had Edward to care for,
his younger brother, who made a rush upon him now
and then, from school first, and then from Sandhurst,
always wanting money, and much indulgence for his
peccadilloes and stupidities: but no one else who
took any interest in himself or his possessions : and
Edward liked a cigar far better than a bronze, and
among all his brother's possessions, except bank notes
and stray sovereigns, or an occasional cheque when he

had been more extravagant than usual, cared for
nothing but the French novels, which Heathcote
picked up too, not because he liked them much, but
because everybody did so  and Edward liked them
because they were supposed to be so wrong. Edward
vas not on the whole an attractive boy. He had a
great many tastes and a great many friends who
were far from agreeable to his brother, but he was
the only real ' object in life ' to Heathcote, who petted
him much and lectured him as little as was possible.
There seemed to be scarcely any other point at which
his own contemplative, inactive existence touched
the practical necessities of life.

He came back to London with the idea that he
would be very glad to return again to the quiet of
his chambers, where nothing ever happened. He
said to himself that excursions into the outer world,
where something was always happening, were a mistake.
He had but stepped out of his hermitage
without thinking, once in a way, to pay a visit
which, after all, was a duty visit, when a whole
tragedy came straightway about his ears  accident,

death, sorrow, injustice, a heroine, and a cruel father,
and all the materials of a full-blown romance. How
glad he would be, he thought, to get into his hermitage
again ! Within its quiet centre there was
everything a man wanted  books, an occasional cigar,
an easy chair (when it was clear from papers and
general literature) for a friend to sit in. But when
he did get back, he was not so certain of its advantages
: no doubt it was everything that could
be desired  but yet, it was a hermitage, and the
outlook from the windows was not cheerful. If
Park Lane was brighter than the view across the
park at Mount, the Albany, with its half-monastic
shade, like a bit of a male beguinage, was less
bright. He sat at his window, vaguely looking out
a thing he had never had the slightest inclination
to do before  and felt an indescribable sense of the
emptiness of his existence. Nor was this only because
he had got used to the new charms of household
life, and liked a house with women in it, as he had
suggested to himself  not even that  it was an influence
more subtle. He took Edward with him to

Park Lane, and presented that hero, who did not
understand his new relations. He thought Eose
was ' very jolly,' but Anne alarmed him. And the
ladies were not very favourably moved towards
Edward. Heathcote had hoped that his young
brother might be captivated by them, and that this
might very possibly be the making of him : as the
friends of an unsatisfactory young man are always
so ready to hope. But the result did not justify
his expectation. * If the little 'un were by herself,
without those two old fogeys, she might, perhaps,
be fun,' Edward thought, and then he gave his
brother a description of the favourite Bet Bouncer
of his predilections. This attempt having failed,
Heathcote for his part did not fall into mere aimless
fluttering about the house in Park Lane as fora
time he had been tempted to do. It was not
the mere charm of female society which had moved
him. Life had laid hold upon him on various sides,
and he could not escape into his shell, as of old.
Just as Cosmo Douglas had felt, underneath all the
external gratifications of his life, the consciousness

that everybody was asking, ' What Douglass does
he belong to ? ' so Heathcote, in the stillness of his
chambers, was conscious that his neighbours were
saying, ' He is Montfort of Mount.' As a matter
of fact very few people knew anything about Mount
but it is hard even for the wisest to understand
how matters which so deeply concern themselves
should be utterly unimportant to the rest of the
world. And by-and-by many voices seemed to wake
up round him, and discuss him on all sides. ' He
has a very nice old place in the country, and a
bit of an entailed estate  nothing very great, but
lands that have been in the family for generations.
Why doesn't he go and look after it ? ' He did
not know if those words were really said by any one,
yet he seemed to hear them circling about his head,
coming like labels in an old print out of the mouths
of the men at his club. ' Why doesn't he look after
his estate ? Is there nothing to be done on his property
that he stays on, leading this idle life here ? '
It was even an object of surprise to his friends that
he had not taken the good of the shooting or invited

VOL. III. E

any one to share it. He seemed to himself to be
hunted out of his snug corner. The Albany was
made unbearable to him. He held out as long as the
ladies remained in Park Lane, but when they were
gone he could not stand it any longer  not, he represented
to himself, that it was on their account he
remained in London. But there was a certain duty
in the matter, which restrained him from doing ashe
pleased while they were at hand and might require
his aid. They never did in the least require
his aid  they were perfectly well off, with plenty of
means, and servants, and carriages, and unbounded
facilities for doing all they wanted. But when they
went away, as they did in February, he found out,
what he had been suspecting for some time, that
London was one vast and howling wilderness, that
the Albany was a hideous travesty of monasticism,
fit only for men without souls, and lives without
duties; and that when a man has anything that
can be called his natural business in life, it is the
right thing that he should do it. Therefore, to the
astonishment and disgust of Edward, who liked to

have his brother's chambers to come to when he
ran up to town '  a thing less difficult then than in
these days of stricter discipline  Heathcote Mount-ford
turned his back upon his club and his hermitage,
and startled the parish out of its wits by
arriving suddenly on a rainy day in February at the
dreary habitation which exercised a spell upon him,
the house of his ancestors, the local habitation to
which in future his life must belong, whether he
liked it or not.

And certainly its first aspect was far from a
cheerful one. The cook, now housekeeper, had made
ready for him hastily, preparing for him the best
bedroom, the room where Mr. Montfort, now distinguished
as the old Squire, had lain in state,
and the library where he had lived through his
life. It was all very chilly when he arrived, a dampness
clinging to the unoccupied house, and a white
mist in all the hollows of the park. He could not
help wondering if it was quite safe, or if the humid
chill which met him when he entered was not the
very thing to make a solitary inhabitant ill, and end

his untimely visit in a fever. They did their very
best for him in the house. Large fires were lighted,
and the little dinner, which was served in a corner of
the dining-room, was as dainty as the means of the
place would allow. But it would be difficult to imagine
anything more dreary than the first evening.
He sat among ghosts, thinking he heard Mr. Mount-ford's
step, scarcely capable of restraining his imagination
: seeing that spare figure seated in his usual
chair, or coming in, with a characteristic half-suspicious
inspecting look he had, at the door. The
few lamps that were in working order were insufficient
to light the place. The passages were all black
as night, the windows, when he glanced out at them
behind the curtains, showing nothing but a universal
blackness, not even the sky or the trees. But if the
trees were not visible, they were audible, the wind
sighing through them, the rain pattering  a wild
concert going on in the gloom. And when the
rain ceased it was almost worse. Then there came
silence, suspicious and ghostly, broken by a sudden
dropping now and then from some overcharged evergreen,

the beating of a bough against a window, the
hoot of the owl in the woods. After he had swallowed
his dinner Heathcote got a book, and sat
himself down solemnly to read it. But when he
had read a page he stopped to listen to the quiet,
and it chilled him over again. The sound of footsteps
over the stone pavements, the distant clang of
a hansom driving up, the occasional voices that
passed his window, all the noises of town, would
have been delightful to him : but instead here he
was at Mount, all alone, with miles of park separating
him from any living creature, except the maids
and outdoor man who had been left in charge.

Next morning it was fine, which mended matters
a little. Fine ! he said to himself with a little
shiver. But he buttoned up his great-coat and went
out, bent upon doing his duty. He went to the
Kectory first, feeling that at least this would be an
oasis in the desert, and found the clergy sitting in
two different rooms, over two sermons, which was
not a cheerful sight. The Eector was writing his
with the calm fluency of thirty years of use and

wont ; but poor Charley was biting his pen over his
manuscript with an incapacity which every successive
Sunday seemed to increase rather than diminish.
My father, he has got into the way of it,' the Curate
said in a tone which was half admiring, half despairing.
Charley did not feel sure that he himself would
ever get into the way of it. He had to take the
afternoon service when the audience was a very
dispiriting one : even Miss Fanny Woodhead did
not come in the afternoon, and the organ was
played by the schoolmaster, and the hymns were
lugubrious beyond description. As the days began
to grow longer, and the winter chill to take ever
a deeper and deeper hold, the Curate had felt the
mournfulness of the position close round him.
When Mount was shut up there was nobody to
speak to, nobody to refer to, no variety in his life.
A house with only two men in it, in the depths of
the country, with no near neighbours, and not a
very violent strain of work, and no special relief
of interesting pursuits, is seldom a cheerful house.
When Charley looked up from his heavy studies and

saw Heatlicote, lie almost upset Ins table in his jump
of delighted welcome. Then there succeeded a moment
of alarm. ' Are they all well ?  nothing has
happened ? ' he cried, in sudden panic. ' Nothing
at all Heathcote said, 'except what concerns myself.'
And it amused the stranger to see how
relieved his host was by this assurance, and how
cheerfully he drew that other chair to the fire to
discuss the business which only concerned so secondary
a person. Charley, however, was as sympathetic
as heart could desire, and ready to be interested in
everything. He understood and applauded the new
Squire's sentiments in respect to his property and
his new responsibilities. 'It is quite true,' the
Curate said with a very grave face, ' that it makes
the greatest difference to everybody. When Mount
is shut up the very sky has less light in it,' said
the good fellow, growing poetical. Heathcote had a
comprehension of the feeling in his own person
which he could not have believed in a little
while ago, but he could scarcely help laughing,
which was inhuman, at the profound depression in

Charley Ashley's face, and which showed in every
line of his large, limp figure. His countenance
itself was several inches longer than it had been in
brighter days.

I am afraid,' said Heathcote, with a smile,
that so much opening of Mount as my arrival will
make, will not put very much light into the sky.'

And it is not only the company and the comfort,'
said the Curate, ' we feel that dreadfully, my
father and I  but there is more than that. If anyone
was ill in the village, there was somebody down
directly from Mount with beef-tea and wine and
whatever was wanted ; and if any one was in trouble,
it was always a consolation to tell it to the young
ladies, and to hear what they thought. The farmers
could not do anything tyrannical, nor the agents be
hard upon a tenant  nor any one,' cried Charley, with
enthusiasm, 'maltreat any one else. There was
always a court of appeal at Mount.'

My dear fellow,' said Heathcote, ' you are thinking
of a patriarchal age you are thinking of something

quite obsolete, immodest, destructive of all
political economy.'

That for political economy ! ' said the Curate,
snapping his fingers ; his spirits were rising  even
to have some one to grumble to was a consolation.
Political anything is very much out of place in a
little country parish. What do our poor labourers
know about it ? They have so very little at the
best of times, how are they to go on when they are
ill or in trouble, without some one to give them a
lift?'

Then they should have more for their work,
Ashley. I am afraid it is demoralising that they
should be so dependent upon a Squire's house.'

Who is to give them more ? ' cried the Curate,
hotly. ' The farmer's have not got so very much
themselves ; and I never said they were dependent ;
they are not dependent  they are comfortable enough
as a matter of fact. Look at the cottages, you will
see how respectable they all are. There is no real
distress in our parish  thanks,' he added, veering

round very innocently and unconsciously to the other
side of the circle, ' to Mount.'

We need not argue the point,' said Heathcote,
amused. ' I am as sorry as you can be that the
ladies will not retain possession. What is it to me ?
I am not rich enough to do all I would, and I don't
know the people as they did. They will never lookup
to me as they did to my predecessors. I hope
my cousins will return at all events in summer. All
the same,' he added, laughing, ' I am quite illogical '
like you, he would have said, but forbore. ' I want
them to come back, and yet I feel this infection of
duty that you speak of. It seems to me that it must
be my business to live here henceforward  though
I confess to you I think it will be very dismal, and
I don't know what I shall do.'

It will be dismal,' said the Curate ; his face had
lighted up for a moment, then rapidly clouded over
again. ' / don't know what you will do. You that
have been always used to a luxurious town life '

Not so luxurious  and not so exclusively
town,' Heathcote ventured to interpose, feeling a

whimsical annoyance at this repetition of his own
thoughts.

And who don't know the people, nor understand
what to do, and what not to do  it takes a long
apprenticeship,' said Charley, very gravely. ' You
see, an injudicious liberality would be very bad for
them  it would pauperise instead of elevating. It
is not everybody that knows what is good and what
is bad in help. People unaccustomed to the kind of
life do more harm than good.'

You don't give me very much encouragement
to settle down on my property and learn how to bea
patriarch in my turn,' said Montfort, with a
laugh.

No, I don't,' said the Curate, his face growing
longer and longer. The presence of Heathcote
Montfort at Mount had smiled upon him for a
moment. It would be better than nothing ; it would
imply some companionship, sympathy more or less,
some one to take a walk with occasionally, or to have
a talk with, not exclusively parochial ; but when the
Curate reflected that Heathcote at Mount would

altogether do away with the likelihood of 'the
family ' coming back  that they could not rent the
house for the summer, which was a hope he had
clung to, if the present owner of it was in possession
Charley at once perceived that the immediate pleasure
of a neighbour would be a fatal advantage, and
with honest simplicity applied himself to the task
of subduing his visitor's new-born enthusiasm. ' You
see,' he said, ' it's quite different making a new
beginning, knowing nothing about it, from having
been born here, and acquainted with the people all
your life.'

Everybody must have known, however,' said
Heathcote, slightly piqued, ' that the property would
change hands some time or other, and that great
alterations must be made.'

Oh yes, everybody knew that,' said the Curate,
with deadly seriousness ; ' but, you see, when you
say a thing must happen some time, you never know
when it will happen, and it is always a shock when
it comes. The old Squire was a hearty man, not at
all old for his years. He was not so old as my

father, and I hope he has a great deal of work left
in him yet. And then it was all so sudden ; none of
us had been able to familiarise ourselves even with
the idea that you were going to succeed, when in a
moment it was all over, and you had succeeded. I
don't mean to say that we are not very glad to
have you,' said Charley, with a dubious smile, suddenly
perceiving the equivocal civility of all he had
been saying ; ' it is a great deal better than we could
have expected. Knowing them and liking them,
you can have so much more sympathy with us about
them. And as you wish them to come back, if that

is possible '

Certainly, I do wish them to come back  if it
is possible,' said Heathcote, but his countenance, too,
grew somewhat long. He would have liked for himself
a warmer reception, perhaps. And when he went
to see Mr. Ashley, though his welcome was very
warm, and though the Rector was absolutely gleeful
over his arrival, and confided to him instantly half a
dozen matters in which it would be well that he
should interest himself at once, still it was not very

long before ' they ' recurred also to the old man's
mind as the chief object of interest. Why are they
going abroad ? it would be far better if they would
come home,' said the Rector, who afterwards apologised,
however, with anxious humility. ' I beg your
pardon  I beg your pardon with all my heart. I
forgot actually that Mount had changed hands. Of
course, of course, it is quite natural that they should
go abroad. They have no home, so to speak, till
they have made up their mind to choose one, and I
always think that is one of the hardest things in
the world to do. It is a blessing we do not appreciate,
Mr. Montfort, to have our home chosen for
us and settled beyond our power to change '

I don't think Mrs. Montfort dislikes the power
of choice,' said Heathcote ; ' but so far as I am concerned,
you know I should be very thankful if they
would continue to occupy their old home.'

I know, I know. You have spoken most kindly,
most generously, exactly as I could have wished you
to speak,' said the Rector, patting Heathcote on the
shoulder, as if he had been a good boy. Then he

took hold of his arm and drew him towards the
window, and looked into his eyes. ' It is a delicate
question,' he said, ' I know it is a delicate question :
but you've been in town, and no doubt you have
heard all about it. What is going to happen about
Anne ? '

'Nothing that I know of,' Heathcote replied
briefly. ' Nothing has been said to me.'

Tchk, tchk, tchk ! ' said the Rector, with that
particular action of the tongue upon the palate,
which is so usual an expression of bother, or annoyance,
or regret, and so little reducible into words.
He shook his head. ' I don't understand these sort
of shilly-shally doings,' he said ; ' they would have
been incomprehensible when I was a young man.'

The same question was repeated by Mr. Loseby,
whom next day Heathcote went to see, driving over
to Hunston in the Eector's little carriage, with the
sober old horse, which was in itself almost a member
of the clerical profession. Mr. Loseby received him
with open arms, and much commended the interest
which he was showing in his property. ' But Mount

will be a dreary place to live in all by yourself,' he
said. ' If I were you I would take up my abode at
the Rectory, at least till you can have your establishment
set on a proper footing. And now that is
settled,' said the lawyer (though nothing was
settled), ' tell me all about Anne.'

I know nothing to tell you,' said Heathcote.
Mr. Douglas is always there '

Mr. Douglas is always there ! but there is nothing
to tell, nothing settled ; what does the fellow
mean ? Do you suppose she is going to forego every
advantage, and go dragging on for years to suit his
convenience ? If you tell me so '

But I don't tell you so,' cried Heathcote ; ' I
tell you nothing  I don't know anything. In short,
if you don't mind, I'd rather not discuss the question.
I begin to be of your opinion, that I was a
fool not to turn up a year sooner. There was nothing
to keep me that I am aware of; I might as
well have come sooner as later ; but I don't know
that any one is to be blamed for that.'

Ah I ' said the old lawyer, rubbing his hands,

what a settlement that would have made ! Anne
would have kept her money, and little Eose her proper
place and a pretty little fortune, just like herself
and probably would have married William Ashley,
a very good sort of young fellow. There would have
been some pleasure in arranging a settlement like
that. I remember when I drew out the papers for
her mother's marriage  that was the salvation of
the Mountfords  they were sliding downhill as fast
as they could before that ; but Miss Roper, who was
the first Mrs. St. John Montfort, set all straight.
You get the advantage of it more or less, Mr.
Heathcote, though the connection is so distant.
Even your part of the property is in a very different
condition from what it was when I remember it
first. And if you had  not been a fool  but had
come in time and tried your chance Ah ! however,
I dare say if it had been so, something would
have come in the way all the same ; you would not
have fancied each other, or something would have
happened. But if that fellow thinks that he is to

blow hot and cold with Anne '

VOL. III. F

I don't like the mere suggestion. Pardon me,'
said Heath cote, ' I am sure you mean nothing but
love and tenderness to my cousin : but I cannot
have such a thing suggested. Whatever happens to
Anne Montfort, there will be nothing derogatory
to her dignity ; nothing beneath her own fine
character, I am sure of that.'

'I accept the reproof,' said Mr. Loseby, with
more twinkle than usual in his spectacles, but less
power of vision through them. ' I accept the reproof.
What was all heaven and earth about,
Heathcote Montfort, that you were left dawdling
about that wearisome Vanity Fair that you call the
world, instead of coming here a year since, when
you were wanted ? If there is one thing more than
another that wants explaining it is the matrimonial
mismanagement of this world. It's no angel that
has the care of that, I'll answer for it ! ' cried the
little man with comic indignation. And then he
took off his spectacles and wiped them, and grasped
Heathcote Montfort by the hand and entreated him
to stay to dinner, which, indeed, the recluse of Mount
was by no means unwilling to do.

CHAPTER XXIX.

Charley INTERFERES.

Heathcote Montfort, however, notwithstanding
the dullness and the dismal weather, and all the
imperfections of the incomplete household, continued
at Mount. The long blanks of country life, nothing
happening from the arrival of one post to another,
no stir of life about, only the unbroken stillness of
the rain or the sunshine, the good or bad weather,
the one tempting him out, the other keeping him
within, were all novelties, though of the heavy kind,
and gave him a kind of amused spectator consciousness
of the tedium, rather than any suffering from it.
He was not so easily affected as many people would
be by the circumstances of external life, and knowing
that he could at any moment go back to his
den at the Albany, he took the much deeper secus

2

sion of Mount as a sort of ' retreat,' in which he
could look out upon the before and after, and if he
sometimes 'pined for what was not,' yet could doit
enviously and bitterly, wondering at rather
than objecting to the strange misses and blunders
of life. Mr. Loseby, who had tutored Anne in her
duties, did the same for Heathcote, showing him by
what means he could 'take an interest' in the
dwellers upon his land, so as to be of some use
to them. And he rode about the country with the
land-agent, and became aware, and became proud ashe
became aware, of the character of his own possessions,
of the old farmhouses, older than Mount itself,
and the old cottages, toppling to their ruin, among
which were many that Anne had doomed. Wherever
he went he heard of what Miss Anne had done, and
settled to do. The women in the condemned cottages
told him the improvements she had promised,
and he, in most cases, readily undertook to carry out
these promises, notwithstanding his want of means.
'They're doing it at Lilford, where Miss Anne has
been and given her orders,' said the women. 'I

don't know why there should be differences made.
We're as good every bit as the Lilford folks.' ' But
you have not got Miss Anne,' said Heathcote. And
then there would be an outburst of lamentations,
interrupted by anxious questioning. ' Why haven't
we got Miss Anne ?  is it true as all the money has
been left away from her ? ' Heathcote had a great
many questions of this kind to answer, and soon
began to feel that he himself was the supposed culprit
to whom the estate had been ' left away.' ' I
am supposed to be your supplanter,' he wrote to
Anne herself, ' and I feel your deputy doing your
work for you. Dear Lady of Mount, send me your
orders. I will carry them out to the best of my
ability. I am poor, and not at all clever about the
needs of the estate, but I think, don't you think ?
that the great Mr. Bestrode, who is so good as to be
my agent, is something of a bully, and does not by
any means do his spiriting gently. What do you
think ? You are not an ignoramus, like me.' This
letter Anne answered very fully, and it produced a
correspondence between them which was a great

pleasure to Heathcote, and not only a pleasure, but in
some respects a Help, too. She approved greatly of
his assumption of his natural duties upon his own
shoulders, and kindly encouraged him ' not to mind '
the bullying of the agent, the boorishness of Farmer
Rawlins, and the complaints of the Springs. In this
matter of the estate Anne felt the advantage of her
experience. She wrote to him in a semi-maternal
way, understanding that the information she had to
give placed her in a position of superiority, while
she gave it, at least. Heathcote was infinitely
amused by these pretensions ; he liked to be schooled
by her, and made her very humble replies ; but the
burden of all his graver thoughts was still that
regret expressed by Mr. Loseby, Why, why had he
not made his appearance a year before ? But now
it was too late.

Thus the winter went on. The Mountfords had
gone abroad. They had been in all the places where
English families go while their crape is still fresh, to
Paris and Cannes, and into Italy, trying, as Mrs.
Montfort said, Hie effect of a little change.' And

they all liked it, it is needless to deny. They were
so unaccustomed to use their wings that the mere
feeling of the first flight, the wild freedom and sense
of boundless action and power over themselves filled
them with pleasure. They were not to come back
till the summer was nearly over, going to Switzerland
for the hot weather, when Italy became too
warm. They had not intended, when they set out, to
stay so long, but indeed it was nearly a year from the
period of Mr. Montfort's death when they came
home. They did not return to Park Lane, nor to
any other settled abode, but went to one of the
many hotels near Heathcote's chambers, to rest fora
few days before they settled what they were to do
for the autumn ; for it was Mrs. Montfort's desire
to go ' abroad ' again for the winter, staying only
some three months at home. When the little world
about Mount heard of this, they were agitated by
various feelings  desire to get them back alternating
in the minds of the good people with indignation at
the idea of their renewed wanderings, which were all
put down to the frivolity of Mrs. Montfort ; and a

continually growing wonder and consternation as to
the future of Anne. ' She has no right to keep a
poor man hanging on so long, when there can be no
possible reason for it ; when it would really be an
advantage for her to have someone to fall back upon,'
Miss Woodhead said, in righteous indignation over
her friend's extraordinary conduct  extraordinary as
she thought it. ' Eose has her mother to go with
her. And I think poor Mr. Douglas is being treated
very badly for my part. They ought to come home
here, and stay for the three months, and get the
marriage over, among their own people.' Fanny
Woodhead was considered through all the three
adjacent parishes to be a person of great judgment,
and the Eector, for one, was very much impressed
with this suggestion. ' I think Fanny's idea should
be acted upon. I think it certainly should be acted
on,' he said. 'The year's mourning for her father
will be over, if that is what they are waiting for 
and look at all the correspondence she has, and the
trouble. She wants somebody to help her. Someone
should certainly suggest to Anne that it would

be a right thing to follow Fanny Woodhead's advice.'


Heathcote, who, though he had allowed himself
a month of the season, was back again in Mount,
with a modest household gathered round him, and
every indication of a man ' settling down,' concurred
in this counsel, so far as to write, urging very warmly
that Mount should be their head-quarters while they
remained in England. Mr. Loseby was of opinion
that the match was one which never would come
off at all, an idea which moved several bosoms with
an unusual tremor. There was a great deal of
agitation altogether on the subject among the little
circle, which felt that the concerns of the Mountfords
were more or less concerns of their own ; and
when it was known that Charley Ashley, who was
absent on his yearly holiday, was to see the ladies
on his way through London, there was a general
impression that something would come of it  that
he would be able to set their duty before them, or to
expedite the settlement of affairs in one way or
another. The Curate himself said nothing to anyone,

but he had a very serious purpose in his mind.
He it was who had introduced these two to each
other ; his friendship had been the link which had
connected Douglas  so far as affairs had yet gone,
very disastrously  with the woman who had been
the adoration of poor Charley's own life. He had
resigned her, having neither hopes nor rights to
resign, to his friend, with a generous abandonment,
and had been loyal to Cosmo as to Anne, though at
the cost of no little suffering to himself. But, if it
Twere possible that Anne herself was being neglected,
then Charley felt that he had a right to a word in
the matter. He was experimenting sadly in French
seaside amusements with his brother at Bologna,
when the ladies returned to England. Charley and
Willie were neither of them great in French. They
had begun by thinking all the humours of the bathing
place ' fun,' and laughing mightily at the menin
their bathing dresses, and feeling scandalised at
their presence among the ladies ; but, after a few days,
they had become very much bored, and felt the drawback

of having 'nothing to do ; ' so that, when they
heard that the Mountfords had crossed the Channel
and were in London, the two young mien made haste to
follow. It was the end of July when everybody was
rushing out of town, and only a small sprinkling of
semi-fashionable persons were to be seen in the
scorched and baked parks. The Mountfords were
understood to be in town only for a few days. It
was all that any lady who respected herself could
imagine possible at this time of the year.

I suppose they'll be changed,' Willie said to his
brother, as they made their way to the hotel. ' I
have never seen them since all these changes came
about ; that is, I have never seen Rose. I suppose
Rose won't be Rose now, to me at least. It is rather
funny that such a tremendous change should come
about between two times of seeing a person whom
you have known all your life.' By ' rather funny '
Willie meant something much the reverse of amusing:
but that is the way of English youth. He,
too, had entertained his little dreams, which had
been of a more substantial character than his

brother's; for Willie was destined for the bar, and
had, or believed himself to have, chances much
superior to those of a country clergyman. And
according to the original disposition of Mr. St.
John Montfort's affairs, a rising young fellow at the
bar, with Willie Ashley's hopes and connections,
would have been no very bad match for little
Rose. This it was that made him feel it was
funny.' But still his heart was not gone together
in one great sweep out of his breast, like Charley's.
And he went to see his old friends with a little
quickening of his pulse, yet a composed determination
' to see if it was any use.' If it seemed to
him that there was still an opening, Willie was not
afraid of Rose's fortune, and did not hesitate to form
ulterior plans ; and he stood on this great vantage
ground that, if he found it was not ' any use,' he had
no intention of breaking his heart.

When they went in, however, to the hotel sitting-room
in which the Mountfords were, they found Rose
and her mother with their bonnets on, ready to go
out, and there were but a few minutes for conversation.

Rose was grown and developed so that
her old adorer scarcely recognised her for the
first minute. She was in a white dress, profusely
trimmed with black, and made in a fashion to which
the young men were unaccustomed, the latest Parisian
fashion, which they did not understand, indeed,
but which roused all their English conservatism of
feeling, as much as if they had understood it. ' Ob,
how nice of you to come to see us ! ' Rose cried.
'Are you really passing through London, and were
you at Bologna when we came through ? I never
could have imagined you in France, either the one
or the other. How did you get on with the talking ?
You could not have any fun in a place unless you
understood what people were saying. Mamma, I
don't think we ought to wait for Mr. Douglas ; it is
getting so late.'

'Here is Mr. Douglas,' said Mrs. Montfort ;
he is always punctual. Anne is not going with
us ; she has so much to do  there is quite a packet
of letters from Mr. Loseby. If you would rather be
let off going with us, Mr. Douglas, you have only

to say so ; I am sure we can do very well by ourselves.'


But at this suggestion Eose pouted, a change of
expression which was not lost upon the anxious
spectators.

I came for the express purpose of going with
you,' said Cosmo; 'why should I be turned off
now?'

Oh, I only thought that because of Anne ;

but of course you will see Anne after. Will you
all, like good people, come back and dine, as we are
going out now? No, Charley, I will not, indeed,
take any refusal. I want to hear all about Mount,
dear Mount  and what Heathcote Montfort is
doing. Anne wishes us to go to Hunston ; but I
don't know that I should like to be so near without
being at Mount.'

Is Anne too busy to see us now ? I should
just like to say how d'you do.'

Oh, if you will wait a little, I don't doubt that
you will see her. But I am sure you will excuse us
now, as we had fixed to go out. We shall see you

this evening. Mind you are here by seven o'clock,'
cried Mrs. Montfort, shaking her fingers at them
in an airy way which she had learned 'abroad.'
And Rose said, as they went out, ' Yes, do come, I
want to hear all about Mount.' About two minutes
after they left the room Anne came in. She had
not turned into a spider or wasp, like Eose in her
Paris costume, but she was much changed. She no
longer carried her head high, but had got a habit
of bowing it slightly, which made a curious difference
in her appearance. She was like a tall flower
bent by the winds, bowing before them ; she was
more pale than she used to be; and to Charley it
seemed that there was an inquiry in her eyes, which
first cast one glance round, as if asking something,
before they turned with a little gleam of pleasure
to the strangers.

You here ? ' Anne said. ' How glad I am to
see you ! When did you come, and where are you
staying? I am so sorry that mamma and Eose
have gone out; but you must come back and see
them : or will you wait ? They will soon be back ; '

and once more she threw a glance round, investigating
 as if some one might be hiding somewhere,
Willie said. But his brother knew better. Charley
felt that there was the bewilderment of wonder in
her eyes, and felt that it must be a new experience to
her that Cosmo should not wait to see her. For a
moment the light seemed to fade in her face, then
came back : and she sat down and talked with a
subdued sweetness that went to their hearts. ' Not
to Mount,' she said ; ' Heath cote is very kind, but I
don't think I will go to Mount. To Hunston rather
where we can see everybody all the same.'

What is the matter with Anne ? ' Willie Ashley
asked, wondering, when they came away. ' It can't
be because she has lost her money. She has no
more spirit left in her. She has not a laugh left
in her. What is the cause of it all ? ' But the
Curate made no answer. He set his teeth, and he
said not a word. There was very little to be got out
of him all that day. He went gloomily about with
his brother, turning Willie's holiday into a somewhat
poor sort of merry-making. And when they

went to dinner with the Mountfords at night,
Charley's usual taciturnity was so much aggravated
that he scarcely could be said to talk at all. But
the dinner was gay enough. Rose, it seemed to
young Ashley, who had his private reasons for being-critical,
' kept it up ' with Douglas in a way which
was not at all pleasant. They had been together
all the afternoon, and had all sorts of little recollections
in common. Anne was much less subdued
than in the morning, and talked like her old self,
yet with a difference. It was when the party broke
up, however, that Willie Ashley felt himself most
ill-used. He was left entirely out in the cold by his
brother, who said to him briefly, ' I am going home
with Douglas,' and threw him on his own devices.
If it had not been that some faint guess crossed the
younger brother's mind as to Charley's meaning, he
would have felt himself very badly used.

The Curate put his arm within his friend's. It
was somewhat against the grain, for he did not feel
so amicable as he looked. ' I am coming back with
you,' he said. ' We have not had a talk for so long.

VOL. Il G

I want to know what you've been after all this long
while.'

Very glad of a talk,' said Douglas, but neither
was he quite as much gratified as he professed to
be ; ' but as for coming back with me, I don't know
where that is to be, for I am going to the club.'

I'll walk with you there,' said Charley. However,
after this announcement Cosmo changed his
mind : he saw that there was gravity in the Curate's
intentions, and turned his steps towards his rooms.
He had not been expected there, and the lamp was
not lighted, nor anything ready for him ; and there
was a little stumbling in the dark and ringing of
bells before they got settled comfortably to their
tete-astute, Charley seated himself in a chair by the
table while this was going on, and when lights came
he was discovered there as in a scene in a theatre,
heavy and dark in his black clothes, and the pale
desperation with which he was addressing himself to
his task.

Douglas,' he said, ' for a long time I have
wanted to speak to you '

Speak away,' said the other ;  but have a pipe
to assist your utterance, Charley. You never could
talk without your pipe.'

The Curate put away the offered luxury with a
determined hand. How much easier, how much
pleasant it would have been to accept it, to veil
his purpose with the friendly nothings of conversation,
and thus perhaps delude his friend into disclosures
without affronting him by a solemn demand !
That would have been very well had Charley had
any confidence in his own powers  but he had not,
and he put the temptation away from him.  No,
thank you, Douglas,' he said, ' what I want to say is
something which you may think very interfering
and impertinent. Do you remember a year ago
when you were at the Rectory and we had a talk 
one very wet night ? '

Perfectly. You were sulky because you thought
I had cut you out ; but you always were the best of
fellows, Charley '

'Don't talk of it like that. You might have
taken my life blood from me after that, and I

G 2

shouldn't have minded. That's a figure of speech.
I mean that I gave up to you then what wasn't
mine to give, what you had got without any help
from me. You know what I mean. If you think I
didn't mind, that was a mistake. A great many
things have happened since then, and some things
have not happened that looked as if they ought
to have done so. You made use of me after that,
and I was glad enough to be of use. I want to ask
you one question now, Douglas. I don't say that
you'll like to be questioned by me '

No,' said Cosmo, ' a man does not like to be
questioned by another man who has no particular
right to interfere : for I don't pretend not to understand
what you mean.'

No : you can't but understand what I mean.
All of us, down about Mount, take a great interest
there's never a meeting in the county of any kind
but questions are always asked. As for my father,
he is excited on the subject. He cannot keep
quiet. Will you tell me for his satisfaction and my
own, what is going to come of it ? is anything going

to come of it? I think that, as old friends, and
mixed up as I have been all through, I have a right
to inquire.'

You mean,' said Cosmo, coolly knocking a pipe
upon the mantelpiece with his back turned to the
questioner, whose voice was broken with emotion,
and who was grasping the table nervously all the
while he spoke  ' you mean, is marriage going to
come of it? at least, I suppose that is what you
mean.'

The Curate replied by a sort of inarticulate
gurgle in his throat, an assent which excitement
prevented from forming itself into words.

'Well!' said the other. He took his time to
everything he did, filled the pipe aforesaid, lighted
it with various long-drawn puffs, and finally seated
himself at the opposite side of the dark fireplace,
over which the candles on the mantelpiece threw
an additional shadow. ' Well ! it is no such simple
matter as you seem to think.'

I never said it was a simple matter ; and yet
when one thinks that there are other men,' cried

the Curate, with momentary vehemence, ' who would
give their heads '

Douglas replied to this outburst with a momentary
laugh, which, if he had but known it, as nearly
gave him over to punishment as any foolish step he
ever took in his life. Fortunately for him it was
very short, and in reality more a laugh of excitement
than of mirth.

'Oh, there's more than one, is there ? ' he said.
Look here, Charley, I might refuse point-blank to
answer your question. I should have a perfect right.
It is not the sort of thing that one man asks another
in a general way.'

The Curate did not make any reply, and after a
moment Douglas continued 

'But I won't. I understand your motives, if
you don't understand mine. You think I am shilly-shallying,
that I ought to fulfil my engagement,
that I am keeping Anne hanging on.'

Don't name any names,' cried Ashley, hoarsely.

'I don't know how I can give you an answer
without naming names : but I'll try to please you.

Look here, it is not such an easy matter, plain-sailing
and straightforward as you think. When I
formed that engagement I was  well, just what T
am now  a poor devil of a barrister, not long called,
with very little money, and not much to do. But,
then, she was rich. Did you make a remark ? '

Charley had stirred unconsciously, with a movement
of indignant fury, which he was unable altogether
to restrain. But he made no answer, and
Douglas continued with a quickened and somewhat
excited tone 

I hope you don't suppose that I mean to say
that had anything to do with the engagement.
Stop ! yes, it had. I should not have ventured to
say a word about my feelings to a poor girl. I
should have taken myself off as soon as they became
too much for me. I don't hide the truth from you,
and 1 am not ashamed of it. To thrust myself and
her into trouble on my present income is what I
never would have thought of. Well, you know all
that happened as well as I do. I entreated her not
to be rash, I begged her to throw me over, not so

much as to think of me when her father objected.
She paid no attention. I don't blame her '

Blame her ! '

Those were the words I used. I don't blame
her. She knew nothing about poverty. She was
not afraid of it : it was rather a sort of excitement
to her, as they say a revolution was to the French
princesses. She laughed at it, and defied her father.
If you think I liked that, or encouraged that, it is
a mistake ; but what could I do ? And what am I
to do now ? Can I bring her here, do you think ?
What can I do with her ? I am not well enough
off to marry. I should never have dreamt of such
a thing on my own account. If you could show
me a way out of it, I should be very thankful. As
for working one's self into fame and fortune and
all that kind of thing, you know a little what mere
romance it is. Some fellows do it ; but they don't
marry to begin with. I am almost glad you interviewed
me to get this all out. What am I to do ?
I know no more than you can tell me. I have got
the character of playing fast and loose, of behaving

badly to a girl whom I love and respect ; for I do
love and respect her, mind you, whatever you and
your belongings may think or say.'

You could not well help yourself, so far as I
can see,' said the Curate hotly.

That is all you know. If you were in my place
and knew the false position into which I have been
brought, the expectations I have been supposed to
raise, the reluctance I have seemed to show in
carrying them out  by Jove ! if you could only
feel as I do all the miseries of my position, unable
to stir a step one way or another '

I know men who would give their heads to
stand in your position '

And what would they do in it ? ' asked Douglas,
pulling ineffectually at the pipe, which had long
gone out. ' Say yourself, for example ; you are
totally different  you have got your house and your
settled income, and you know what is before you.'

I can't discuss it in this way. Do you imagine
that I have as much to spend, to use your own argument,'
cried the Curate, ' as you have here ? '

It is quite different,' Douglas said. Then he
added, with a sort of dogged determination, ' I am
getting on. I think I am getting the ball at my
foot ; but to marry at present would be destruction
and to her still more than to me.'

Then the short and the long is '

The short and the long is exactly what I have
told you. You may tell her yourself, if you please.
Whatever love in a cottage may be, love in chambers
is impossible. With her  fortune we could have
married, and it would have helped me on. Without
it, such a thing would be madness, ruin to me and to
her too.'

Charley rose up, stumbling to his feet. ' This is
all you have got to say ? ' he said.

Yes, that is all I have got to say ; and, to tell
the truth, I think it is wonderfully good of me to
say it, and not to show you politely to the door ; but
we are old friends, and you are her old friend '

Good-night, Douglas,' the Curate said, abruptly.
He did not offer his friend his hand, but went out
bewildered, stumbling down the stairs and out at the

door. This was what he had yielded up all his hopes
(but he never had any hopes) for ! this was what
Anne had selected out of the world. He did not
go back to his hotel, but took a long walk round
and round the parks in the dismal lamplight, seeing
many a dismal scene. It was almost morning when
his brother, utterly surprised and alarmed, heard
him come in at last.

CHAPTER XXX.

THE Rector SATISFIED.

No, I did not get any satisfaction ; I can't say that
he gave me any satisfaction,' the Curate said.

He had put down his pipe out of deference to his
father, who had come into the little den inhabited
by Charley the morning after his return. Mr.
Ashley's own study was a refined and comfortable
place, as became the study of a dignified clergyman
; but his son had a little three-cornered room,
full of pipes and papers, the despair of every housemaid
that ever came into the house. Charley had
felt himself more than usually that morning in need
of the solace that his pipe could give. He had returned
home late the evening before, and he had
already had great discussions with his brother Willie
as to Eose Montfort, whom Willie on a second

interview had pronounced 'just as nice as ever,' but
whom the elder had begun to regard with absolute
disgust. Willie had gone off to Hunston to execute
a commission which in reality was from Anne, and
which the Curate had thought might have been
committed to himself  to inquire into the resources
of the ' Black Bull,' where old Saymore had now for
some time been landlord, and to find out whether the
whole party could be accommodated there. The
Cm-ate had lighted his pipe when his brother went
off on this mission. He wanted it, poor fellow !
He sat by the open window with a book upon the
ledge, smoking out into the garden ; the view was
limited, a hedgerow or two in the distance, breaking
the flatness of the fields, a big old walnut tree in
front shutting in one side, a clump of evergreens on
the other. What he was reading was only a railway
novel picked up in mere listlessness ; he pitched
it away into a large untidy waste-paper basket, and
put down his pipe when his father came in. The
Rector had not been used in his youth to such disorderly
ways, and he did not like smoke.

No, sir, no satisfaction ; the reverse of that 
and yet, perhaps, there is something to be said too
on his side,' the Curate said.

Something on his side ! I don't know what you
mean,' cried his father. 'When I was a young
fellow, to behave in this sort of way was disgrace
to an honourable man. That is to say, no honourable
man would have been guilty of it. Your
word was your word, and at any cost it had to be
kept.'

Father,' said Charley with unusual energy, ' it
seems to me that the most unbearable point of all
this is  that you and I should venture to talk of any
fellow, confound him ! keeping his word and behaving
honourably to That's what I can't put up

with, for my part.'

You are quite right,' said the Eector, abashed
for the moment. And then he added, pettishly,
but what can we do ? We must use the common
words, even though Anne is the subject. Charley,
there is nobody so near a brother to her as you are,
nor a father as I.'

Yes, I suppose I'm like a brother,' the Curate
said with a sigh.

Then tell me exactly what this fellow said.'
Mr. Ashley was wound up for immediate action.
Perhaps the increased tedium of life since the departure
of ' the family ' from Mount had made him
more willing, now when it seemed to have come to
a climax, for an excitement of any kind.

It isn't what she has a right to,' said the Curate,
painfully impartial when he had told his tale. ' She
ought to be received like a blessing wherever she
goes. We know that better than anyone : but I

don't say that Douglas doesn't know it too '

Don't let me hear the fellow's name ! '
That's very true, sir,' said the Curate ; ' but,
after all, when you come to think of it! Perhaps,
now-a-days, with all our artificial arrangements, you

know At least, that's what people say. He'd

be bringing her to poverty to please himself. He'd
be taking her out of her own sphere. She doesn't
know what poverty means, that's what he says 
and she laughs at it. How can he bring her into

trouble which she doesn't understand  that's what
he says.'

'He's a fool, and a coward, and an idiot, and
perhaps a knave, for anything I can tell ! ' cried the
Rector in distinct volleys. Then he cried sharply
with staccato distinctness, ' I shall go to town tonight.'


To town ! to-night ? I don't see what you
could do, sir!' said the Curate, slightly wounded,
with an injured emphasis on the pronoun, as much
as to say, if / could not do anything, how should you ?
But the Rector shook off this protest with a gesture
of impatience, and went away, leaving no further
ground for remonstrance. It was a great surprise
to the village generally to hear that he was going
away. Willie Ashley heard of it before he could
get back from Hunston ; and Heathcote Montfort
in the depths of the library which, the only part
of the house he had interfered with, he was now
busy transforming. 'The Rector is going to London
! ' 'It has something to do with Anne and her
affairs, take my word for it ! ' cried Fanny Wood-head,

who was so clear-sighted, ' and high time that
somebody should interfere ! '

The Rector got in very late, which, as everybody
knows, is the drawback of that afternoon train. You
get in so late that it is almost like a night journey ;
and he was not so early next morning as was common
to him. There was no reason why he should be
early. He sent a note to Anne as soon as he was upto
ask her to see him privately, and about eleven
o'clock sallied forth on his mission. Mr. Ashley
had come to town not as a peacemaker, but, as it
were, with a sword of indignation in his hand. He
was half angry with the peaceful sunshine and the
soft warmth of the morning. It was not yet hot in
the shady streets, and little carts of flowers were being
driven about, and all the vulgar sounds softened
by the genial air. London was out of town, and
there was an air of grateful languor about everything
; few carriages about the street, but perpetual
cabs loaded with luggage  pleasure and health for
those who were going away, a little more room and
rest for those who were remaining.
VOL. III. H

But the Eector was not in a humour to see the
best side of anything. He marched along angrily,
encouraging himself to be remorseless, not to mind
what Anne might say, but if she pleaded for her lover,
if she clung to the fellow, determining to have no
mercy upon her. The best of women were such
fools in this respect. They would not be righted
by their friends ; they would prefer to suffer, and
defend a worthless fellow, so to speak, to the last
drop of their blood. But all the same, though the
Rector was so angry and so determined, he was also
a little afraid. He did not know how Anne would
take his interference. She was not the sort of girl
whom the oldest friend could dictate to  to whom
he could say 'Do this,' with any confidence that
she would do it. His breath came quick and his
heart beat now that the moment approached, but
There is nobody so near a father to her as I am,' he
said to himself, and this gave him courage. Anne
received him in a little sitting-room which was reserved
to herself. She was sitting there among her
papers waiting for him, and when he entered came

forward quickly, holding out her hands, with some
anxiety in her face. ' Something has happened ? '
she said, she too with a little catching of her breath.

No  nothing, my dear, nothing to alarm you ;
I mean really nothing at all, Anne  only I wanted
to speak to you '

She put him into a comfortable chair, and drew
her own close to him, smiling, though still a little
pale. ' Then it is all pleasure,' she said, ' if it is not
to be pain. What a long time it is since I have
seen you ! but we are going to Hunston, where we
shall be quite within reach. All the same you look
anxious, dear Mr. Ashley  you were going to speak
to me '

About your ownaffairs, my dear child,' he said.

 Ah ! ' a flush came over her face, then she grew
paler than before. ' Now I know why you look so
anxious,' she said, with a faint smile. ' If it is only
about me, however, we will face it steadily, whatever
it is '

Anne,' cried the Rector, taking both her hands

H 2

in his  ' Anne, my dear child ! I have loved you as
if you had been my own all your life.'

She thanked him with her eyes, in which there
was the ghost of a melancholy smile, but did not
speak.

And I can't bear to see you slighted, my dear.
You are slighted, Anne, you whom we all think too
good for a king. It has been growing more and
more intolerable to me as the months have gone by.
I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it any longer. I
have come to say to yourself that it is not possible,
that it must not go on, that it cannot be.'

Anne gave his hands which held hers a quick
pressure. ' Thank you,' she said, ' dear Mr. Ashley,
for coming to me. If you had gone to anyone else I
could not have borne it : but say whatever you will
to me.'

Then he got up, his excitement growing. ' Anne,
this man stands aloof. Possessing your love, my
dear, and your promise, he has  not claimed either
one or the other. He has let you go abroad, he
has let you come home, he is letting you leave

London without coming to any decision or taking
the place he ought to take by your side. Anne,
hear me out ; you have a difficult position, my dear ;
you have a great deal to do ; it would be an advantage
to you to have someone to act for you, to stand
by you, to help you.'

So far as that goes,' she said with a pained smile
' no : I don't think there is very much need of
that.'

Listen to me, my dear. Eose has her mother ;
she does not want your personal care, so that is no
excuse ; and all that you have to do makes it more
expedient that you should have help and support.
None of us but would give you that help and support,
oh ! so gladly, Anne ! But there is one whom
you have chosen, by means of whom it is that you are
in this position  and he holds back. He does not
rush to your side imprudently, impatiently, as he
ought. What sort of a man is it that thinks of prudence
in such circumstances ? He lets you stand
alone and work alone : and he is letting you go away,
leave the place where he is, without settling your

future, without coming to any conclusion  without
even a time indicated. Oh, I have no patience
with it -I cannot away with it ! ' said the Rector,
throwing up his arms, ' it is more than I can put up
with. And that you should be subjected to this,
Anne ! '

Perhaps she had never been subjected to so hard
an ordeal as now. She sat with her hands tightly
clasped on the table, her lips painfully smiling, a
dark dew of pain in her eyes  hearing her own
humiliation, her downfall from the heights of worship
and service where she had been placed all her
life by those who loved her, recounted like a well-known
history. She thought it had been all secret
to herself, that nobody had known of the wondering
discoveries, the bitter findings out, the confusion of
all her ideas, as one thing after another became clear
to her. It was not all clear to her yet ; she had
found out some things, but not all. And that all
should be clear as daylight to others, to the friends
who she had hoped knew nothing about it! this
knowledge transfixed Anne like a sword. Fiery

arrows had struck into her before, winged and blazing,
but now it was all one great burning scorching
wound. She held her hands clasped tight to keep
herself still. She would not writhe at least upon the
sword that was through her, she said to herself, and
upon her mouth there was the little contortion of a
smile. Was it to try and make it credible that she
did not believe what he was saying, or that she did
not feel it, that she kept that smile ?  or had it got
frozen upon her lips so that the ghost could not pass
away ?

When he stopped at last, half frightened by his
own vehemence, and alarmed at her calm, Anne was
some time without making any reply. At last she
said, speaking with some difficulty, her lips being
dry : ' Mr. Ashley, some of what you say is true.'

'Some  oh, my dear, my dear, it is all true 
don't lay that flattering unction to your soul. Once
you have looked at it calmly, dispassionately '

Here Anne broke forth into a little laugh, which
made Mr. Ashley hold out his hands in eager deprecation,
' Oh, don't, my darling, don't, don't ! '

*No,' she said, 'no, no  I will not laugh  that
would be too much. Am I so dispassionate, do you
think ? Able to judge calmly, though the case is

my own '

'Yes, Anne,' cried the old Rector; his feelings
were too much for him  he broke down and sobbed
like a woman. ' Yes, my beautiful Anne, my dearest
child! you are capable of it  you are capable of
everything that is heroic. Would I have ventured
to come to you but for that ? You are capable of
everything, my dear.'

Anne waited a little longer, quite silently, holding
her hands clasped tight. One thing she was not
capable of, and that was to stand up. Whatever
else she might be able to do, she could not do that.
She said under her breath, ' Wait for a moment,' and
then, when she had got command of herself, rose
slowly and went to the table on which her papers
were. There she hesitated, taking a letter out of
the blotting-book  but after a moment's pause
brought it to him. 'I did not think I should ever
show  a letter  to a third person,' she said with

confused utterance. Then she went back to her
table, and sat down and began to move with her
hands among the papers, taking up one and laying-down
another. The Eector threw himself into the
nearest chair and began to read.

Dear Cosmo,  You will think it strange to get a
long letter from me, when we met this morning ;
and yet, perhaps, you will not think it strange  you
will know.

In the first place let me say that there are a
great many things which it will not be needful to
put on paper, which you and I will understand without
words. We understand  that things have not
been lately as they were some time ago. It is nobody's
fault; things change  that is all about it.
One does not always feel the same, and we must be
thankful that there is no absolute necessity that we
should feel the same ; we have still the full freedom
of our lives, both I and you.

This being the case, I think I should say to you
that it seems to me we have made a mistake. You

would naturally have a delicacy in saying it, but
women have a privilege in this respect, and therefore
I can take the initiative. We were too hasty, I
fear ; or else there were circumstances existing then
which do not exist now, and which made the bond
between us more practicable, more easily to be
realised. This is where it fails now. It may be
just the same in idea, but it has ceased to be possible
to bring anything practicable out of it; the
effort would involve much, more than we are willing
to give, perhaps more  I speak brutally, as the
French say  than it is worth.

In these uncertainties I put it to you whether it
would not be better for us in great friendship and
regret to shake hands and  part ? It is not a pleasant
word, but there are things which are much less
pleasant than any word can be, and those we must
avoid at all hazards. I do not think that your present
life and my present life could amalgamate anyhow
 could they? And the future is so hazy, so
doubtful, with so little in it that we can rely upon 
the possibilities might alter, in our favour, or against

US, but no one can tell, and most probably any
change would be disadvantageous. On the other
hand, your life, as fit present arranged, suits you
very well, and my life suits me. There seems no
reason why we should make ourselves uncomfortable,
is there ? by continuing, at the cost of much inconvenience,
to contemplate changes which we do not
very much desire, and which would be a very doubtful
advantage if they were made.

This being the case  and I think, however unwilling
you may be to admit it, to start with, that if
you ask yourself deep down in the depths of your
heart, you will find that the same doubts and questions,
which have been agitating my mind, have
been in yours, too  and that there is only one
answer to them  don't you think my suggestion is
the best ? Probably it will not be pleasant to either
of us. There will be the talk and the wondering of
our friends, but what do these matter ?  and what is
far worse, a great crying out of our own recollections
and imaginations against such a severance  but
these, I feel sure, lie all on the surface, and if we are

brave and decide upon it at once, will last as short a
time as  most other feelings last in this world.

If you agree with me, send me just three words
to say so  or six, or indeed any number of words 
but don't let us enter into explanations. Without
anything more said, we both understand.

Your true friend in all circumstances,

Anne.'

There are some names which are regal in their
mere simplicity of a few letters. This signature
seemed like Anne Princess, or Anne Queen to the
eyes of the old man who read it. He sat with the
letter in his hands for some time after he had read
to the end, not able to trust his voice or even his old
eyes by any sudden movement. The writer all this
time sat at her table moving about the papers.
Some of the business letters which were lying there
she read over. One little note she wrote a confused
reply to, which had to be torn up afterwards. She
waited  but not with any tremor  with a still sort
of aching deep down in her heart, which seemed to

answer instead of beating. How is it that there is
so often actual pain and heaviness where the heart
lies, to justify all our metaphorical references to it ?
The brain does not ache when our hearts are sore ;
and yet they say our brains are all we have to feel
with. Why should it be so true, so true, to say
that one's heart is heavy ? Anne asked herself this
question vaguely as she sat so quietly moving about
her papers. Her head was as clear as yours or mine,
but her heart  which, poor thing, means nothing
but a bit of hydraulic machinery, and was pumping
away just as usual  lay heavy in her bosom like a
lump of lead.

My dear child, my dear child ! ' the old Eector
said at length, rising up hastily and stumbling towards
her, his eyes dim with tears, not seeing his
way. The circumstances were far too serious for his
usual exclamation of ' God bless my soul ! ' which,
being such a good wish, was more cheerful than the
occasion required.

Do you think that is sufficient ? ' said Anne,
with a faint smile. ' You see I am not ignorant

of  the foundations. Do you think that
will do?'

My dear, my dear ! ' Mr. Ashley said. He did
not seem capable of saying any more.

With that Anne, feeling very like a woman at
the stake  as if she were tied to her chair, at least,
and found the ropes, though they cut her, some supports
 took the letter out of his hand and put it into
an envelope, and directed it very steadily to ' Cosmo
Douglas, Esq., Middle Temple.' 'There, that is
over,' she said. The ropes were cutting, but certainly
they were a support. The papers before her
were all mixed up and swimming about, but yet
she could see the envelope  four-square  an accomplished
thing, settled and done with ; as perhaps she
thought her life too also was.

'Anne,' said the old Rector, in his trembling
voice, ' my dear I I know one far more worthy of
you, who would give all the world to know that he
might hope '

She put out one hand and pushed herself away
from the table. The giddiness went off, and the

papers again became perceptible before her. You
don't suppose that I  want anything to do with any
man?' she said, with an indignant break in her
voice.

No, my dear ; of course you do not. It would
not be in nature if you did not scorn and turn

from But, Anne,' said the old Eector, ' life will

go on, do what you will to stand still. .You cannot
stand still, whatever you do. You will have to walk
the same path as those that have gone before you.
You need never marry at all, you will say. But
after a while, when time has had its usual effect, and
your grief is calmed and your mind matured, you
will do like others that have gone before you. Do
not scorn what I say. You are only twenty-two when
all is done, and life is long, and the path is very
dreary when you walk by yourself and there is no
one with you on the way.'

Anne did not say anything. It was her policy
and her safety not to say anything. She had come
to herself. But the past time had been one of great
struggle and trial, and she was worn out by it. After

a while Mr. Ashley came to see that the words of
wisdom he was speaking fell upon deaf ears. He
talked a great deal, and there was much wisdom and
experience and the soundest good sense in what he
said, only it dropped half-way, as it were, on the
wing, on the way to her, and never got to Anne.

He went away much subdued, just as a servant
from the hotel came to get the letters for the post.
Then the Eector left Anne, and went to the other
part of the house to pay his respects to the other
ladies. They had been out all the morning, and
now had come back to luncheon.

Mr. Douglas is always so good,' Mrs. Mount-ford
said. ' Fortunately it is the long vacation ; but
I suppose you know that ; and he can give us almost
all his time, which is so good of him. It was only
the afternoons in the winter that we could have.
And he tells Eose everything. I tell her Mr.
Douglas is more use to her than any governess she
ever had.'

Is Anne never of your parties ? ' the Hector
said.

Oh, Anne ! she is always busy about something
else she says she is busy. I am sure she need not
shut herself up as she does. I wish you would speak
to her. You are an old friend, and always had a
great influence over Anne. She is getting really
morose  quite morose  if you will take my opinion,'
said Mrs. Montfort. Eose was almost as emphatic.
I don't know what she has against me. I cannot
seal myself up as she does, can I, Mr. Ashley ? No,
she will never come with us. It is so tiresome ; but
I suppose when we are in the country, which she is
always so fond of, that things will change.'

Just then Anne came into the room softly, in
her usual guise. Mr. Ashley looked at her half in
alarm. She had managed to dismiss from her voice
and manner every vestige of agitation. What practice
she must have had, the Eector said to himself,
to be able to do it.

I hope you have had a pleasant morning,' she
said. She did not avoid Cosmo, but gave him her
hand as simply as to the rest. She addressed him
little, but still did not hesitate to address him, and

VOL. III. I

once the Rector perceived her looking at him unawares
with eyes full of the deepest compassion.
Why was she so pitiful? Cosmo did not seem to
like the look. He was wistful and anxious. Already
there was something, a warning of evil, in the air.

CHAPTER XXXI.

FALLEN From HEU niGH ESTATE.

The 'Black Bull' at Hunston is one of those old
inns which have been superseded, wherever it is
practicable, by new ones, and which are in consequence
eagerly resorted to by enlightened persons,
wherever they are to be found ; but there was nobody
in Hunston, beyond the ordinary little country-town
visitors, to appreciate its comfortable old rooms,
old furniture, and old ways. Ashen there was a county
ball, the county people who had daughters engaged
rooms in it occasionally, and the officers coming from
Scarlet-town filled up all the corners. But county
balls were rare occurrences, and there had not been
yet under the regime of old Saymore a single instance
of exceptional gaiety or fulness. So that,
though it was highly respectable, and the position

i2

of landlord one of ease and dignity, the profits had
been as yet limited* Saymore himself, however, in
the spotless perfection of costume which he had so
long kept up at Mount, and with his turn for artistic
arrangements, and general humble following of
the ' fads ' of his young ladies, was in himself a
model of a master for a Queen Anne house (though
not in the least what the prototype of that character
would have been), and was in a fair way to make his
house everything which a house of that period ought
to be. And though Keziah, in the most fashionable
of nineteenth-century dresses, was a decided anachronism,
yet her little face was pleasant to the travellers
arriving hot and dusty on an August evening, and
finding in those two well-known figures a something
of home which went to their hearts. To see
Saymore at the carriage door made Mrs. Montfort
put her handkerchief to her eyes, a practice which
she had given up for at least six months past.
And, to compare small things with great, when
Keziah showed them to their rooms, notwithstanding
the pride of proprietorship with which she led the

way, the sight of Anne and Rose lead a still greater
effect upon little Mrs. Saymore ; Rose especially, in
her Paris dress, with a waist like nothing at all 
whereas to see Keziah, such a figure ! She cried,
then dried her tears, and recollected the proud advances
in experience and dignity she had made, and
her responsibilities as head of a house, and all her
plate and linen, and her hopes : so much had she
gone through, while with them everything was just
the same : thus pride on one side in her own second
chapter of life, and envy on the other of the freedom
of their untouched lives produced a great commotion
in her. ' Mr. Saymore and me, we thought this
would be the nicest for Miss Anne, and I put you
here, Miss Rose, next to your mamma. Oh, yes, I
am very comfortable. I have everything as I wish
for. ;Mr. Saymore don't deny me nothing  he'd buy
me twice as many things as I want, if I'd let him.
How nice you look. Miss Rose, just the same, only
nicer ; and such style ! Is that the last fashion ? It
makes her look just nothing at all, don't it. Miss
Anne? Oh, when we was all at Mount, how we'd

have copied it, and twisted it, and changed it to look
something the same, and not the least the same 
but I've got to dress np to forty and look as old as I
can now.'

Saymore came into the sitting-room after them
with his best bow, and that noiseless step, and those
ingratiating manners which had made him the best
of butlers. ' I have nothing to find fault with,
ma'am,' he said. ' I've been very well received, very
well received. Gentlemen as remembered me at
Mount has been very kind. Mr. Loseby, he has
many a little luncheon here. " I'll not bother my
old housekeeper," he says, when he has gentlemen
come sudden. "I'll just step over to my old friend
Saymore. Saymore knows how to send up a nice
little lunch, and he knows a good glass of wine
when he sees it." That's exactly what Mr. Loseby
said, no more than three days ago. But business is
quiet,' Saymore added. 'I don't complain, but
things is quiet; we'd be the better, ma'am, of a
little more stir here.'

But I hope you find everything comfortable  at

home, Saymore?' said Ms former mistress. 'You
know I always told you it was an experiment. I
hope you find everything comfortable at home.'

Meaning Mrs. Saymore, ma'am ? ' replied the
landlord of the ' Black Bull,' with dignity. ' I'm
very glad to say as she have given me and everybody
great satisfaction. She is young, but that is a
fault, as I made so bold as to observe to you, ma'am,
on a previous occasion, a fault as is sure to mend.
I've never repented what I did when I married.
She's as nice as possible downstairs, but never too
nice  giving herself no airs : but keeping her own
place. She's given me every satisfaction,' said Say-more,
with much solemnity. In the meantime
Keziah was giving her report on the other side of
the question, upstairs.

'No, Miss Anne. I can't say as I've repented.
Oh, no, I've never repented. Mr. Saymore is very
much respected in Hunston  and there's never a
day that he don't bring me something, a ribbon or a
new collar, or a story book if he can't think of nothing
else. It was a little disappointing when

mother was found not to do in the kitchen. You
see, Miss Anne, we want the best of cooking when
strangers come, and mother, she was old-fashioned.
She's never forgiven me, though it wasn't my fault.
And Tommy, he was too mischievous for a waiter.
We gave him a good long try, but Mr. Saymore was
obliged at last to send him away. Mother says she
don't see what it's done for her, more than if I had
stayed at Mount  but I'm very comfortable myself,
Miss Anne,' said Keziah, with a curtsey and a tear.

I am very glad to hear it : and I hope you'll be
still happier by-and-by,' said Anne, retiring to the
room which was to be hers, and which opened from
the little sitting-room in which they were standing.
Eose remained behind for further talk and gossip.
And when all the news was told Keziah returned to
her admiration of the fashion of Eose's gown.

Are they all made like that now, in Paris ? Oh,
dear, I always thought when you went to France
I'd go too. I always thought of Paris. But it
wasn't to be.'

You see, Keziah, you liked Saymore best,' said

Eose, fixing her mischievous eyes upon Keziah's face,
who smiled a little sheepish smile, and made a
little half-pathetic appeal with her eyes, but did
not disown the suggestion, which flattered her vanity
if not her affection.

'You are as blooming as a rose. Miss  as you
always was,' said Keziah, ' but what's Miss Anne been
a-doing to herself? She's like a white marble image
in a church ; I never saw her that pale.'

Hush ! ' cried Rose, in a whisper, pointing to the
door behind them, by which Anne had disappeared ;
and then she came close to the questioner, with
much pantomime and mystery. ' Don't say a word,
Keziah. It is all broken off. She has thrown the
gentleman over. Hush, for heaven's sake, don't say
a word I '

'You don't mean it. Miss Rose. Broken off!
Mr. Dou '

Rose put her hand on the little landlady's mouth.
She must not hear we are talking of her. She
would never forgive me. And besides, I don't know
-  it is only a guess ; but I am quite, quite sure.'

Keziah threw up her hands and her eyes. ' All
broken off  thrown the gentleman over ! Is there
someone else ? ' she whispered, trembling, thinking
with mingled trouble and complacency of her own
experiences in this kind, and of her unquestioned
superiority nowadays to the lover whom she had
thrown over  the unfortunate Jim.

No, no, no,' said Rose, making her mouth into
a circle, and shaking her head. No other! No
richer, better, more desirable lover! This was a
thing that Keziah did not understand. Her face
grew pale with wonder, even with awe. To jilt a
gentleman for your own advancement in life, that
might be comprehensible  but to do it to your own
damage, and have cheeks like snowflakes in consequence
 that was a thing she could not make out.
It made her own position, with which she was already
satisfied, feel twice as advantageous and comfortable ;
even though her marriage had not turned out so
well for mother and the boys as Keziah had once
hoped.

Mr. Loseby came across the street, humming a

little tune, to join them at dinner. He was shining
from top to toe in his newest black suit, all shining,
from his little varnished shoes to his bald head, and
with the lights reflected in this spectacles. It was a
great day for the lawyer, who was fond of both the
girls, and who had an indulgent amity, mingled with
contempt, for Mrs. Montfort herself, such as men
so often entertain for their friends' wives. He was
triumphant in their arrival, besides, and very anxious
to secure that they should return to the neighbourhood
and settle among their old friends. He,
too, however, after his first greetings were over,
was checked in his rejoicing by the paleness of
his favourite. ' What have you been doing to
Anne ? ' were, after his salutations, the first words he
said.

If anything has been done to her, it is her own
doing,' said Mrs. Montfort, with a little indignation.


Nothing has been done to me,' said Anne, with
a smile. 'I hear that I am pale, though I don't
notice it. It is all your letters, Mr. Loseby, and the

business you give me. I have to let mamma and
Rose go to their dissipations by themselves.'

Our dissipations ! You do not suppose I have
had spirits for much dissipation,' said Mrs. Mount-ford,
now fully reminded of her position as a widow,
and with her usual high sense of duty, determined
to live up to it. She pressed her handkerchief upon
her eyelids once more, after the fashion she had
dropped. ' But it is true that I have tried to go out
a little,' she added, ' more than I should have done
at home  for Rose's sake.'

You were quite right,' said the lawyer ; ' the
young ones cannot feel as we do, they cannot be
expected to go on in our groove. And Rose is blooming
like her name. But I don't like the looks of
Anne. Have I been giving you so much business todo
? But then, you see, I expected that you would
have Mr* Douglas close at hand, to help you. Indeed,
my only wonder was -'

Here Mr. Loseby broke off, and had a fit of
coughing, in which the rest of the words were lost.
He had surprised a little stir in the party, a furtive

interchange of looks between Mrs. Montfort and
Rose. And this roused the alarm of the sympathetic
friend of the family, who, indeed, had wondered
much  as he had begun to say 

No,' said Anne, with a smile, ' you know I was
always a person of independent mind. I always liked
to do my work myself. Besides, Mr. Douglas has
his own occupations, and the chief part of the time
we have been away.'

'To be sure,' said Mr. Loseby. He was much
startled by the consciousness which seemed to pervade
the party, though nothing more was said. Mrs.
Montfort became engrossed with her dress, which
had caught in something ; and Rose, though generally
very determined in her curiosity, watched Anne, the
spectator perceived, from under her eyelids. Mr.
Loseby took no notice externally. ' That's how it
always happens,' he said cheerfully ; ' with the best
will in the world we always find that our own business
is as much as we can get through. I have found
out that to my humiliation a hundred times in my
Use.'

'These questions about the leases are the most
difficult,' said Anne, steadily. 'I suppose the old
tenants are not always the best.'

My dear, I hope in these bad times we may get
tenants at all, old or new,' said the old lawyer.
And then he plunged into the distresses of the
country, the complaints of the farmers, the troubles
of the labourers, the still greater trials of the landlord.
' Your cousin Heathcote has made I don't
know how much reduction. I am not at all sure
that he is right. It is a dreadfully bad precedent
for other landlords. And for himself he simply can't
afford it. But I cannot get him to hear reason.
What does it matter to me ? " he says, " I have
always enough to live on, and those that till the land
have the best right to any advantage they can get
out of it." What can you say to a man that thinks
like that ? I tell him he is a fool for his pains ; but
it is I who am a fool for mine, for he takes no notice
though I talk myself hoarse.'

Indeed, I think it is very unjustifiable conduct,'
said Mrs. Montfort. 'He should think of

those who are to come after him. A man lias no
right to act in that way as if he stood by himself.
He ought to marry and settle down. I am sure I
hope he will have heirs of his own, and not leave
the succession to that horrid little Edward. To
think of a creature like that in Mount would be
more than I could bear.'

I doubt if Heathcote will ever marry ; not unless
he gets the one woman  But we don't all get
that even when we are most lucky,' said the old
lawyer, briskly. ' He is crotchety, crotchety, full
of his own ideas : but a fine fellow all the same.'

Does he want to marry more than one woman ? '
cried Eose, opening great eyes, ' and you talk of it
quite coolly, as if it was not anything very dreadful ;
but of course he can't, he would be hanged or something.
Edward is not so bad as mamma says. He
is silly ; but, then, they are mostly silly.' She had
begun to feel that she was a person of experience,
and justified in letting loose her opinion. All this
time it seemed to Mr. Loseby that Anne was going
through her part like a woman on the stage. She

was very quiet ; but she seemed to insist with herself
upon noticing everything, listening to all that
was said, giving her assent or objection. In former
times she had not been at all so particular, but let
the others chatter with a gentle indifference to what
they were saying. She seemed to attend to everything,
the table, and the minutiae of the dinner,
letting nothing escape her to-night.

I think Heathcote is right,' she said ; ' Edward
will not live to succeed him; and, if he does not
marry, why should he save money, and pinch others
now, on behalf of a future that may never come?
What happens if there is no heir to an entail?
Could not it all be eaten up, all consumed, reabsorbed
into the country, as it were, by the one
who is last?'

Nonsense, Anne. He has no right to be the
last. No one has any right to be the last. To let
an old family die down,' cried Mrs. Montfort, ' it
is a disgrace. What would dear papa have said ?
When I remember what a life they all led me because
I did not have a boy  as if it had been my

fault ! I am sure if all the hair off my head, or
everything I cared for in my wardrobe, or anything
in the world I had, could have made Rose a boy, I
would have sacrificed it. I must say that if Heath-cote
does not marry I shall think I have been very
badly used ; though, indeed, his might all be girls
too,' she added, half hopefully, half distressed.
'Anyhow, the trial ought to be made.' Notwithstanding
the danger to the estate, it would have
been a little consolation to Mrs. Montfort if Heath-cote
on marrying had been found incapable, he also,
of procuring anything more than girls from Fate.

When an heir of entail fails ' Mr. Loseby

began, not unwilling to expound a point on which
he was an authority ; but Rose broke in and interrupted
him, never having had any wholesome fear
of her seniors before her eyes. Rose wanted to know
what was going to be done now they were here ; if
they were to stay all the autumn in the 'Black
Bull ; ' if they were to take a house anywhere ; and
generally what they were to do. This gave Mr.
Loseby occasion to produce his scheme. There was

VOL. m. K

an old house upon the property which had not been
entailed, which Mr. Montfort had bought with his
first wife's money, and which was now the inheritance
of Eose. It had been suffered to fall out of repair,
but it was still an inhabitable house. ' You know
it, Anne,' the lawyer said ; ' it would be an amusement
to you all to put it in order. A great deal
could be done in a week or two. I am told there is
no amusement like furnishing, and you might make
a pretty place of it.' The idea, however, was not
taken up with very much enthusiasm.

'In all probability,' Mrs. Montfort said, * we
shall go abroad again for the winter. The girls like
it, and it is very pleasant, when one can, to escape
from the cold.'

The discussion of this subject filled the rest
of the evening. Mr. Loseby was very anxious on his
side. He declared that it did not bind them to anything
; that to have a house, a pied-parterre, ' even
were it only to put on your cards,' was always an
advantage. After much argument it was decided at
last that the house at Lilford, an old Dower-house,

and bearing that picturesque name, should be looked
at before any conclusion was come to ; and with this
Mr. Loseby took his leave. Anne had taken her full
share in the discussion. She had shown all the
energy that her role required. She had put in suggestions
of practical weight with a leaning to the
Dower-house, and had even expressed a little enthusiasm
about that last popular plaything  a house to
furnish  which nowadays has become the pleasantness
of pastimes. ' It shall be Morris-ey, but not too
Morris ey,' she had said, with a smile, still in perfect
fulfilment of her role. But to see Anne playing at
being Anne had a wonderful effect upon her old
friend. Her stepmother and sister, being with her
perpetually, did not perhaps so readily suspect the
fine histrionic effort that was going on by their side.
It was a fine performance ; but such a performance is
apt to make the enlightened beholder's heart ache.
Amen he had taken his leave of the other ladies 
early, as they were tired, or supposed it right to be
tired, with their journey  Anne followed Mr. Loseby
out of the room. She asked him to come into another

K 2

close by.  I have something to say to you,' she said,
with a faint smile. Mr. Loseby, like the old Rector,
was very fond of Anne. He had seen her grow up
from her infancy. He had played with her when she
was a child, and carried her sugar-plums in his coat
pockets. And he had no children of his own to distract
his attention from his favourite. It troubled
him sadly to see signs of trouble about this young-creature
whom he loved.

'What is it, Anne? What is it, my dear?
Something has happened ? ' he said.

No, nothing of consequence. That is not true,'
she said, hurriedly ; ' it is something, and something
of consequence. I have not said anything about it
to them. They suspect, that is all ; and it does not
matter to them ; but I want to tell you. Mr. Loseby,
you were talking to-night of Mr. Douglas. It is
about Mr. Douglas I want to speak to you.'

He looked at her very anxiously, taking her hand
into his. ' Are you going to be married ? '

Anne laughed. She was playing Anne more than

ever ; but, on the whole, very successfully. ' Ob
no,' sbe said, ' quite the reverse '

Anne ! do you mean that be bas  that you have
that it is broken off ? '

Tbe last form is the best,' sbe said. ' It is alla
little confused just yet. I can't tell if be bas, or
if I have. But yes  I must do him justice : it is
certainly not bis doing. I am wholly responsible
myself. It bas come to an end.'

She looked into bis face wistfully, evidently fearing
what he would say, deprecating, entreating. If
only nothing might be said ! And Mr. Loseby was
confounded. He had not been kept up like the
others to the course of affairs.

Anne, you strike me dumb. You take away my
breath. What ! he whom you have sacrificed everything
for : he who has cost you all you have in
the world ? If it is a caprice, my dear girl, it is a
caprice utterly incomprehensible ; a caprice I cannot
understand.'

That is exactly how to call it,' sbe said, eagerly :
'a caprice, an unpardonable caprice. If Rose bad

done it, I should have whipped her, I believe ; but it
is I, the serious Anne, the sensible one, that have
done it. This is all there is to say. I found myself
out, fortunately, before it was too late. And I
wanted you to know.'

In this speech her powers almost failed her.
She forgot her part. She played not Anne, but someone
else, some perfectly artificial character, which
her audience was not acquainted with, and Mr.
Loseby was startled. He pushed away his spectacles,
and contracted his brows, and looked at her with his
keen, short-sighted eyes, which, when they could-see
anything, saw very clearly. But with all his gazing
he could not make the mystery out. She faced him
now, after that one little failure, with Anne's very
look and tone, a slight, fugitive, somewhat tremulous
smile about her mouth, her eyes wistful, deprecating
blame ; but always very pale : that was the worst of
it, that was the thing least like herself.

After losing,' said the lawyer slowly, ' everything
you had in the world for his sake.'

Yes,' Anne said, with desperate composure, ' it

is ridiculous, is it not ? Perhaps it was a little to
have my own way, Mr. Loseby. Nobody can tell
how subtle one's mind is till one has been tried. My
father defied me, and I suppose I would not give in ;
I was very obstinate. It is inconceivable what a girl
will do. And then we are all obstinate, we Mountfords.
I have heard you say so a hundred times ;
pig-headed, was not that the word you used ? '

Most probably it was the word I used. Oh yes,
I know you are obstinate. Your father was like an
old mule ; but you, you  I declare to you I do not
understand it, Anne.'

Nor do I myself,' she said, with another small
laugh, a very small laugh, for Anne's strength was
going. ' Can any one understand what another does,
or even what they do themselves ? But it is so ; that
is all that there is to say.'

Mr. Loseby walked about the room in his distress.
He thrust up his spectacles till they formed
two gleaming globes on the shining firmament of
his baldness. Sometimes he thrust his hands behind
him under his coat tails, sometimes clasped them

in front of him, wringing their plump joints.
Sacrificed everything for it,' he said, ' made yourself
a beggar ! and now to go and throw it all up. Oh, I
can't understand it, I can't understand it ! there's
more in this than meets the eye.'

Anne did not speak  truth to tell, she could not
she was past all histrionic effort. She propped
herself up against the arm of the sofa, close to which
she was standing, and endured, there being nothing
more that she could do.

Why  why,' cried Mr. Loseby, ' child, couldn't
you have known your own mind ? A fine property !
It was bad enough, however you chose to look at it,
but at least one thought there was something to set
off against the loss ; now it's all loss, no compensation
at all. It's enough to bring your father back
from his grave. And I wish there was something
that would,' said the little lawyer vehemently ; ' I
only wish there was something that would. Shouldn't
I have that idiotical will changed as fast as pen
could go to paper ! Why, there's no reason for it
now, there's no excuse for it. Oh, don't speak to me.

I can't contain myself ! I tell you what, Anne,' he
cried, turning upon her, seizing one of the hands
with which she was propping herself up, and wringing
it in his own, ' there's one thing you can do,
and only one thing, to make me forgive you all the
trouble you have brought upon yourself; and that is
to marry, straight off, your cousin, Heathcote Mount-ford,
the best fellow that ever breathed.'

I am afraid,' said Anne faintly, ' I cannot
gratify you in that, JMr. Loseby.' She dropped away
from him and from her support, and sank upon the
first chair. Fortunately he was so much excited
himself, that he failed to give the same attention to
her looks.

That would make up for much,' he said ; ' that
would cover a multitude of sins.'

Anne scarcely knew when he went away, but he
did leave her at last seated there, not venturing to
move. The room was swimming about her, dark,
bare, half lighted, with its old painted walls. The
prints hung upon them seemed to be moving round
her, as if they were the decorations of a cabin at sea.

She had got through her crisis very stoutly, without,
she thought, betraying herself to anybody. She said
to herself vaguely, always with a half-smile, as being
her own spectator, and naore or less interested in the
manner in which she acquitted herself, that every
spasm would probably be a little less violent, as she
had heard was the case in fevers. And, on the whole,
the spasm like this, which prostrated her entirely,
and left her blind and dumb for a minute or two
to come to herself by degrees, was less wearing than
the interval of dead calm and pain that came
between. This it was that took the blood from her
cheeks. She sat still for a few minutes in the old-fashioned
arm-chair, held up by its hard yet comforting
support, with her back turned to the table and
her face to the half-open door. The very meaning-lessens
of her position, thus reversed from all use
and wont, gave a forlorn completeness to her desolation
 turned away from the table, turned away from
everything that was convenient and natural ; her fortune
given away for the sake of her love, her love
sacrificed for no reason at all, the heavens and the

earth all misplaced and turning round. When Anne
came to herself the half-smile was still upon her lip
with which she had been regarding herself, cast off
on all sides, without compensation  losing everything.
Fate seemed to stand opposite to her, and
the world and life, in which, so far as appearance
went, she had made such shipwreck. She raised
herself up a little in her chair and confronted them
all. Whatever they might do, she would not be
crushed, she would not be destroyed. The smile
came more strongly to the curves of her mouth,
losing its pitiful droop. Looking at herself again,
it was ludicrous ; no wonder Mr. Loseby was confounded.
Ludicrous  that was the only word. To
sacrifice everything for one thing : to have stood
against the world, against her father, against everybody,
for Cosmo : and then by-and-by to be softly
detached from Cosmo, by Cosmo himself, and allowed
to drift, having lost everything, having nothing.
Ludicrous  that was what it was. She gave a little
laugh in the pang of revival. A touch with a red-hot
iron might be as good as anything to stimulate

failing forces and string loose nerves. Ice does it 
a plunge into an icy stream. Thus she mused, getting
confused in her thoughts. In the meantime Eose
and Mrs. Montfort were whispering with grave
faces. 'Is it a quarrel, or is it for good ? I hope
you hadn't anything to do with it,' said the mother,
much troubled. ' How should I have anything to do
with it ? ' said innocent Rose ; * but, all the same, I
am sure it is for good.'

CHAPTER XXXII.

ROSE ON HER DEFENCE.

All the country was stirred by the news of the return
of the Mountfords, and the knowledge that they
were, of all places in the world, at the ' Black Bull '
at Hunston, which was the strangest place to go to,
some people thought, though others were of opinion
that Anne Montfort ' showed her sense ' by taking
the party there. It was Anne who got the credit of
all the family arrangements, and sometimes without
fully deserving it. Lady Meadowlands and Fanny
Woodhead, though at the opposite ends of the social
scale, both concurred in the opinion that it was the
best thing they could have done. Why not go back
to Mount ? some people said, since it was well known
that the bachelor cousin had put the house at their
disposal, and the furniture there still belonged to

Mrs. Montfort. But how could Anne go to Mount,
both these ladies asked, when it was clear as daylight
that Heathcote Montfort, the new master,
was as much in love with her as a man could be ?
Very silly of him, no doubt, and she engaged : but
oh dear, oh dear, Fanny Woodhead cried, what a
waste of good material that all these people should
be in love with Anne ! why should they all be in love
with Anne, when it was clear she could not marry
more than one of them ? Lady Meadowlands took
a higher view, as was natural, being altogether unaffected
by the competition which is so hard upon
unmarried ladies in the country. She said it was a
thousand pities that Anne had not seen Heathcote
Montfort, a very good-looking man, and one withall
his wits about him, and with a great deal of conversation,
before she had been carried away with the
tattle of that Mr. Douglas, who had no looks and no
family, and was only the first man (not a clergyman)
whom she had ever seen. In this particular, it will
be observed, her ladyship agreed with Mr. Loseby,
who had so often lamented over the lateness of

Heathcote's arrival on the field. All these good
people ordered their carriages to drive to Hunston
and call at the ' Black Bull.' The Miss Woodheads
went in their little pony cart, and Lady Meadow-lands
in a fine London carriage, her town chariot,
which was only taken out on great occasions : and
the Rector was driven in by Charley very soberly in
the vehicle which the younger son of the family,
with all the impertinence of Oxford, profanely called
a shandrydan. With each successive visitor Anne's
looks were, above all things, the most interesting
subject. ' I think it suits her,' Lady Meadowlands
said thoughtfully  which was a matter the others
did not take into consideration. ' Don't you think
so, Mr. Montfort?' she said with deliberate
cruelty to Heathcote, who rode back part of the
way by her carriage door. ' I am not a judge,' he
said ; ' I have a great deal of family feeling. I
think most things suit my cousin Anne. If she
were flushed and florid, most likely I should think
the same.'

And you would be perfectly right,' said the first

lady in the county. ' Whatever she does, you'd have
her do so ever. You and I are of the same opinion,
Mr. Montfort'; but if I were you I would not leave
a stone unturned to get her back to Mount.' ' If will
would do it ! ' he said. ' Will can do everything,'
cried the great lady, waving her hand to him as she
turned the corner. He stood still and gazed after
her, shaking his head, while the beautiful bays devoured
the way.

The most agitating of all these visitors to Anne
were the Ashleyss, who knew more about her, she felt,
than all the rest put together. The Eector came in
with an elaborately unconcerned countenance, paying
his respects to the stepmother and commending the
bloom of Eose  but, as soon as he could get an
opportunity, came back to Anne and took her by
the arm, as was his usual way. ' Did you send it ? '
he said in her ear, leading her toward the further
window. It was a large broad bow-window with
round sashes and old-fashioned panes, looking down
the High Street of Hunston. They did not look
at each other, but looked out upon the street as

they stood there, the old man holding the girl close
to him with his arm through hers.

Yes  I sent it  that very day '

And he sent you an answer ? '

A tremor ran through Anne's frame which the
Rector was very sensible of; but he did not spare
her, though he pitied her.

I  suppose so : there was a letter ; it is all over
now, if that is what you mean. Don't talk about it
any more.*

Mr. Ashley held her close by the arm, which he
caressed with the pressure of his own. ' He took it,
then, quietly  he did not make any resistance ? '
he said.

Mr. Ashley,' said Anne, with a shiver running
over her, ' don't let us talk of it any more.'

As you please, as you please, my dear,' said the
old man ; but it was with reluctance that he let her
go ; he had a hundred questions to ask. He wanted
to have satisfied himself about Cosmo, why he had
done it, how he had done it, and everything about
it. The Rector was confused. He remembered the
VOL. III. L

letter to Cosmo, which she had given him to read,
and which had bewildered him at the time by its
apparent calm. And yet now she seemed to mind !
he did not understand it. He wanted to hear
everything about it, but she would not let him ask.
His questions, which he was not permitted to give
vent to, lay heavy upon his heart as he went back.
She would not open her mind to me,' he said to
Charley. ' Whatever has happened, it must have
been a comfort to her to open her mind. That is
what is making her so pale. To shut it all up in
her own heart cannot be good for her. But she
would not open her mind to me.'

It would have been difficult to do it with all
those people present,' the Curate said, and this gave
his father a little consolation. For his own part,
Charley had never been so out of spirits. So longs
she was happy, what did it matter ? he had said so
often to himself. And now she was no longer happy,
and there was nothing any one could do to make her
so. He for one had to stand by and consent to it,
that Anne should suffer. To suffer himself would

have been a hundred times more easy, but he could
not do anything. He could not punish the man
who had been at the bottom of it all. He could not
even permit himself the gratification of telling that
fellow what he thought of him. He must be dumb
and inactive, whatever happened, for Anne's sake.
While the good Eector told out his regrets and disappointment,
and distress because of Anne's silence,
and certainty that to open her heart would do her
good, the Curate was wondering sadly over this one
among the enigmas of life. He himself, and Heath-cote
Montfort, either of them, would have given
half they had (all they had in the world, Charley put
it) to be permitted to be Anne's companion and
comforter through the world. But Anne did not
want either of them. She wanted Cosmo, who would
not risk his own comfort by taking the hand she
held out to him, or sacrifice a scrap of his own life
for hers. How strange it was, and yet so common 
to be met with everywhere. And nobody could do
anything to mend it. He scarcely ventured to allow,
when he was in his parish, that there were a great

L 2

many things of this kind which it was impossible to
him to understand : he had to be very sure that
everything that befell his poor people was ' for their
good ; ' but in the recesses of his own bosom he
allowed himself more latitude. He did not see how
this, for instance, could be for any one's good. But
there is very little consolation in such a view, even
less than in the other way of looking at things. And
he was very 'low,' sad to the bottom of his good
heart. He had not said anything to Anne. He had
only ventured to press her hand, perhaps a little
more warmly than usual, and he had felt, poor
fellow, that for that silent sympathy she had not
been grateful. She had drawn her hand away impatiently
; she had refused to meet his eye. She
had not wanted any of his sympathy. Perhaps it
was natural, but it was a little hard to bear.

Eose had her own grievances while all this was
going on. If her sister, worked into high irritation
])y the questions and significant looks to which she
had been exposed, had found it almost intolerable
to live through the succession of visits, and to meet

everybody with genial indifference, and give an
account of all they had been doing, and all that
they were about to do  Rose was much displeased,
for her part, to find herself set down again out of
the importance to which she had attained, and made
into the little girl of old, the young sister, the nobody
whom no one cared to notice particularly while
Anne was by. It was not Rose's fault, certainly,
that her father had made that will which changed
the positions of herself and her sister : but Lady
Meadowlands, for one, had always treated her as if
it was her fault. Even that, however, was less disrespectful
than the indifference of the others, who
made no account of her at all, and to whom she was
still little Rose, her sister's shadow  nothing at all
to speak of in her own person. They did not even
notice her dress, which she herself thought a masterpiece,
and which was certainly such a work of art
as had never been seen in Hunston before. And
when all these people went away. Rose, for her part,
sought Mrs. Keziah, who was always ready to admire.
She was so condescending that she went downstairs

to the parlour in which old Sayniore and his young-wife
spent most of their lives, and went in for a talk
It was a thing Eose was fond of doing, to visit her
humble friends and dependants in their own habitations.
But there were a great many reasons why she
should do what she liked in Saymore's house : first,
because she was one of 'his young ladies ' whom he
had taken care of all their lives ; second, because she
was an important member of the party who were
bringing success and prosperity to Saymore's house.
She was queen of all that was in the ' Black Bull.'
Miss Anne might be first in Saymore's allegiance,
as was the case with all the old friends of the
family; but, on the other hand, Anne was not a
person to skip about through the house and come in
for a talk to the parlour, as Rose did lightly, with no
excuse at all. 'I am so sick of all those people,' she
cried ; ' 1 wish they would not all come and be
sympathetic ; I don't want any one to be sympathetic
! Besides, it is such a long, long time since.
One must have found some way of living, some way
of keeping on, since then. I wish they would not

be so awfully sorry for us. I don't think now that
even mamma is so sorry for herself.'

'Your mamma is a Christian, Miss Eose,' said
old Saymore, getting up, though with a little reluctance,
from his comfortable arm-chair as she came
in. ' She knows that what can't be cured must be
endured ; but, at the same time, it is a great pleasure
and an honour to see all the carriages of the
gentry round my door. I know for certain. Miss
Rose, that Lady Meadowlands never takes out that
carriage for anybody below a title, which shows the
opinion she has of our family. Your papa was
wonderfully respected in the county. It was a great
loss; a loss to everything. There is not a gentleman
left like him for the trouble he used to take
at Quarter Sessions and all that. It was a dreadful
loss to the county, not to speak of his family. And
a young man, comparatively speaking,' said Saymore,
with a respectful sigh.

Poor dear papa ! I am sure I felt it as much
as any one  at the time,' said Rose ; ' don't you remember,
Keziah, how awful that week was ? I did

nothing but cry ; but for a young man, Saymore,
you know that is nonsense. He was not the least
young ; he was as old, as old '

Here Rose stopped and looked at him, conscious
that the words she had intended to say were, perhaps,
not quite such as her companions would like to hear.
Keziah was sitting by, sewing. She might have
taken it amiss if her young mistress had held up this
new husband of hers as a Methuselah. Rose looked
from one to the other, confused, yet hardly able to
keep from laughing. And probably old Saymore
divined what she was going to say.

Not old. Miss Eose,' he said, with the steady
pertinacity which had always been one of his characteristics;
'a gentleman in the very prime of life.
When you've lived virtuous and sober, saving your
presence. Miss, and never done nothing to wear yourself
out, sixty is nothing but the prime of life.
Young fools, as has nothing but their youth to recommend
them, may say different, but from them
as has a right to give an opinion, you'll never hear
nothing else said. He was as healthy a man, your

late dear papa, as ever I wish to see ; and as hearty,
and as full of life. And all his wits about him, Miss.
I signed a document not longer than the very last
day before he was taken  me and John Gray diner 
and he was as clear as any judge, that's what he
was. " It's not my will," he said to me, " Saymore
or you couldn't sign, as you're one of the legatees ;
for a bit of a thing like this it don't matter." I
never see him more joky nor more pleasant. Miss
Eose. He wasn't joky not in his ordinary, but that
day he was poking his fun at you all the time. " Ita
small bit of a thing to want witnessing, ain't it ? "
he said ; " and it's not a new will, for you couldn't
witness that, being both legatees." '

Eose was a good deal startled by this speech.
Suddenly there came before her a vision of the
sealed-up packet in Anne's desk  the seals of which
she had been so anxious to break. ' What a funny
thing that he should have made you sign a paper ! '
she said.

Bless you, they're always having papers to sign,'
said Saymore ; ' sometimes it's one thing, sometimes

it's another. A deal of money is a deal of trouble.
Miss Eose. You don't know that as yet, seeing as
you've got Miss Anne to do everything for you.'

I shan't always have Miss Anne,' Rose said, not
knowing well what were the words she used; her
mind was away, busy in other ways, very busy in
other thoughts. She had always been curious, as
she said to herself, from the first moment she saw
that packet. What was in it ? could it be the paper
that Saymore signed ? Could it be ?  but Rose did
not know what to think.

When you have not got Miss Anne, you'll have
a gentleman,' Saymore said. 'We ain't in no sort
of doubt about that, Miss Rose, Keziah and me.
There are ladies as always gets their gentleman,
whatever happens ; and one like you, cut out by
nature, and a deal of money besides  there's not no
question about that. The thing will be as you'll
have too many to choose from. It's a deal of responsibility
for a young creature at your age.'

I will come and ask your advice, Saymore,' said

Rose, her head still busy about other things.
Keziah asked my advice, you know.'

Did she, Miss Rose ? Then I hope as you'll
never repent the good advice you gave her,' said old
Saymore, drawing himself up and putting out his
chest, as is the manner of man when he plumes himself.
Rose looked at him with eyes of supreme
ridicule, and even his little wife gave a glance up
from her sewing with a strong inclination to titter ;
but he did not perceive this, which was fortunate.
Neither had Saymore any idea that the advice the
yomig lady had given had ever been against him.
And you might do worse,' he added, ' than consult
me. Servants see many a thing that other folks
don't notice. You take my word. Miss Rose, there's
nowhere that you'll hear the truth of a gentleman's
temper and his goings on, better than in the servants'
hall.'

I wonder if it was a law paper that had to have
two witnesses ? ' said Rose, irrelevantly. ' I wonder
if it was something about the estate ? Anne never
has anything to sign that wants witnesses ; was it a

big paper, like one of Mr. Loseby's ? I should so
like to know what it was.'

It wasn't his will ; that is all I can tell you,
Miss Rose. How joky he was, to be sure, that day !
I may say it was the last time as I ever saw master
in life. It was before they started  him and Mr.
Heathcote, for their ride. He never was better in
his life than that afternoon when they started. I
helped him on with his great-coat myself. He
wouldn't have his heavy coat that he always wore
when he was driving. " The other one, Saymore," he
said, " the other one ; I ain't a rheumatic old fogey
like you," master said. Queer how it all comes back
upon me! I think I can see him, standing as it
might be there. Miss Rose, helping him on with his
coat ; and to think as he was carried back insensible
and never opened his lips more ! '

Rose was awed in spite of herself; and Keziah
Aviped her eyes. ' He spoke to me that day more
than he had done for ever so long,' she said. ' I
met him in the long corridor, and I was that
frightened I didn't know what to do ; but he stopped

as kind as possible. " Is that you, little Keziah ? '
he said. " How is the mother getting on and the
children?" Mother was that pleased when I told
her. She cried, and we all cried. Oh, I don't
wonder as it is a trial to come back, losing a kind
father like that and your nice 'one ! '

Now this was the kind of sympathy which Rose
had particularly announced she did not wish to receive.
She did not in the least regret 'her nice
'one,' but looked back upon Mount with unfeigned
relief to have escaped from the dull old world of its
surroundings. But she was a little touched by these
reminiscences of her father, and a great curiosity was
excited within her upon other matters. She herself
was a very different person from the little girl  the
second daughter, altogether subject and dependent 
which she had been on that fatal day. She looked
back upon it with awe, but without any longing
that it should be undone and everything restored
to its previous order. If Mr, Montfort could come
back, and everything be as before, the change would \
not be a comfortable one for Rose. No change, she

thought, would be pleasant. "WTiat could papa mean,
signing papers on that very last day ? What did he
want witnesses for, after his will was signed and all
done ? Rose did not know what to think of it.
Perhaps, indeed, it was true, as old Say more said,
that gentlemen always had papers to sign ; but it
was odd, all the same. She went away with her head
full of it upstairs to the room where her mother and
sister were sitting. They were both a little languid,
sitting at different ends of the room. Mrs. Mount-ford
had been making much use of her handkerchief,
and it was a little damp after so many hours. She
had felt that if she were not really crying she ought
to be. To see all the old people and hear so many
words of welcome, and regret that things were not
as they used to be, had moved her. She was seated
in this subdued state, feeling that she ought to be
very much affected. She felt, indeed, that she ought
not to be able to eat any dinner  that she ought
to be good for nothing but bed. However, it was
summer, when it is more difficult to retire there.
Mrs. Montfort made great use of her handkerchief.

Anne was seated in the bow-window, looking out
upon the few passengers of the High Street. In
reality she did not see them ; but this was her outside
aspect. Her book was upon her knees. She
had given herself up to her own thoughts, and these,
it was evident, were not over-bright. Eose's coming
in was a relief to both, for, happily, Rose was not
given to thinking. On most occasions she occupied
herself with what was before her, and took no trouble
about what might lie beneath.

Isn't it time to dress for dinner ? ' Rose
said.

To be sure,' cried Mrs. Montfort gratefully.
To make a movement of any kind was a good thing ;
'it must be time to dress for dinner. One feels
quite out here, with no bell to tell us what to do.
I suppose it wouldn't do for Saymore, with other
people in the house, to ring a dressing-bell. One is
lost without a dressing-bell,' the good lady said. She
had her work and her wools all scattered about,
though in the emotion of the moment she had not
been working. Now she gathered them all in her

arms, and, with much content that the afternoon
was over, went away.

Do you ever have things to sign that want
witnesses, Anne ? '

No,' said Anne, looking up surprised. ' Why do
you ask ? Sometimes a lease, or something of that
sort,' she said.

Then perhaps it was a lease,' said Rose to herself.
She did not utter this audibly, or give any
clue to her thoughts, except the ' Oh, nothing,'
which is a girl's usual answer when she is asked
what she means. And then they all went to dress
for dinner, and nothing more could be said.

Nothing more was said that night. As soon as
it was dusk. Mrs. Montfort retired to her room.
It had been a fatiguing day, and everything had
been brought back, she said. Certainly her handkerchief
was quite damp. Worth was very sympathetic
as she put her mistress to bed.

Strangers is safest,' Worth said ; ' I always
did say so. There's no need to keep up before
them, and nothing to be pushed back upon you.

Trouble is always nigh enough, without being forced
back.'

And Eose, too, went to bed early. She had a
great deal of her mother in her. She recognised the
advantage of getting rid of herself, if not in anymore
pleasant way, then in that. But she could not
sleep when she wished, which is quite a different
thing from going to bed. She seemed to see as
plainly as possible, dangling before her, with all its
red seals, the packet which was to be opened on her
twenty-first birthday. Why shouldn't it be opened
now ? What could it matter to any one, and especially
to papa, whether it was read now or two years
hence ? Rose was nineteen ; from nineteen is not a
long step to one-and-twenty. And what if that
packet contained the paper that Saymore had witnessed
? She had told Anne she ought to open it.
She had almost opened it herself while Anne looked
on. If she only could get at it now !

Next morning a remarkable event occurred.
Anne drove out with Mr. Loseby to see the Dower-house
at Lilford, and report upon it. The old

VOL. III. M

lawyer was very proud as she took her seat by him
in his high phaeton.

I hope everybody will see us,' he said. ' I should
like all the people in the county to see Queen Anne
Montfort in the old solicitor's shay. I know some
young fellows that would give their ears to be me,
baldness and all. Every dog has his day, and some
of us have to wait till we are very old. dogs before we
get it.'

Remember, Anne,' said Mrs. Montfort, ' that
if it is the least damp I will have nothing to do
with it.'

Rose watched from the old bow-window with the
round panes to see them drive away. She waved
her hand to Anne, but she was scarcely conscious
what she was doing, her heart beat so much. She
sent her maid out to match some ribbon, which she
knew would take a long time to match, and then
Eose made a general survey of the rooms. They all
opened off a square vestibule, or, more correctly, an
antechamber. She went through her mother's first,
carelessly, as if looking for something ; then through

her own; and only went to Anne's as the last. Her
heart beat high, but she had no feeling that she was
going to do anything that was wrong. How could
it be wrong ? to read a letter a little earlier than
the time appointed for reading it. If there had been
anything to say that Rose was not to read it at all,
then it might have been wrong ; but what could it
possibly matter whether it was read now or in two
years? To be sure, it was not addressed to Eose, but
what of that ? Except Cosmo's letters, which of course
were exceptional, being love-letters, all correspondence
of the family was in common  and especially, of
all things in the world, a letter from poor papa ! But
nevertheless Eose's heart beat as she went into
Anne's room. The despatch-box generally stood by
the writing-table, open, with all its contents ready
for reference. The lid was shut down to-day, which
gave her a great fright. But it was not locked, as
she had feared. She got down on her knees before
it and peeped in. There was the little drawer in
which it had been placed, a drawer scarcely big
enough to contain it. The red seals crackled as she

M 2

took it out with trembling hands. One bit of the-wax
came off of itself. Had Anne been taking a
peep too, though she would not permit Rose to do
so ? No ; there was no abrasion of the paper, no
break of the seal. Rose suddenly remembered that
the very seal her father had used was at this moment
on her mother's desk. She got up hastily to get it,
but then, remembering, took out the packet and
carried it with her. She could lock the door of her
own room, but not of Anne's, and it would not do
to scatter scraps of the red wax about Anne's room
and betray herself. She carried it away stealthily
as a mouse, whisking out and in of the doors. Her
cheeks were flushed, her hands trembling. Now,
whatever it was, in a minute more she would know
all about it. Never in her life had Rose's little being
been in such a commotion. Not when her father's
will was read; not when that gentleman at Cannes
made her her first proposal ; for at neither of these
moments had there been any alarm in her mind for
what was coming. The others might have suffered,
perhaps, but not she.

Mrs. Montfort complained afterwards that she
had not seen Eose all day. ' Where is Eose ? ' Anne
asked when she came back full of the Dower-house,
and anxious to recommend it to all concerned.
After inquiries everywhere it was found that Rose
was lying down in her room with a bad headache.
She had made the maid, when she returned from
her fruitless quest for the ribbon, which could not
be matched, draw down the blinds : and there she
lay in great state, just as Mrs. Montfort herself did
in similar circumstances. Anne, who went up to
see her, came down with a half-smile on her lips.

She says it is like one of your headaches,
mamma ; and she will keep still til] dinner.'

That is the best thing she can do,' said Mrs.
Montfort. ' If she can get a little sleep she will be
all right.'

Secretly it must be allowed that Anne was more
amused than alarmed by her little sister's indisposition.
Mrs. Montfort had been subject to such
retirements as long as any one could remember ; and
Eose's get-up was a very careful imitation of her

mother's  eaii de Cologne and water on a chair beside
her sofa, a wet handkerchief spread upon her
head, her hair let down and streaming on the pillow*

Don't let any one take any notice,' she said in a
faint little voice. ' If I am let alone I shall soon be
better.'

Nobody shall meddle with you,' said Anne, half
laughing. And then she retired downstairs to discuss
the house with Mrs. Montfort, who was only
half an authority when Rose was not by.

But if any one could have known the thoughts
that were going on under the wet handkerchief and
the dishevelled locks ! Rose's head was aching, not
with fever, but with thinking. She had adopted
this expedient to gain time, because she could not
make up her mind what to do. The packet resealed,
though with considerably more expenditure
of wax than the original, was safely returned to-the
despatch-box. But Rose had been so startled
by the information she had received that further
action had become impossible to her. What was
she to do ? She was not going to sit down inter

that not going to submit to it, and live on for two
years knowing all about it. How could she do that ?
This was a drawback that she had not foreseen : information
clandestinely obtained is always a dreadful
burden to carry about. How was she to live for two
years knowing that, and pretending not to know it ?
Never before in her life had the current of thought
run so hot in her little brain. What was she to do ?
Was there nothing she could do ? She lay still for
some minutes after Anne had left her. To be in such
a dilemma, and not to be able to tell anybody  not
to ask anybody's advice ! She thought once of rushing
to Keziah, putting the case to her as of someone
else. But how could Keziah tell her what todo
? At last a sudden gleam of suggestion shot
through Eose's brain ; she sprang half up on her
sofa, forgetting the headache. At this period she
was in a kind of irresponsible unmoral condition,
not aware that she meant any harm, thinking only
of defending herself from a danger which she had
just discovered, which nobody else knew. She must
defend herself. If a robber is after you in the dark,

and you strike out wildly and hurt some one who is
on your side, who is trying to defend you  is that
your fault? Self-defence was the first thing, the
only thing, that occurred to Eose. After it came
into her mind in the sole way in which it was possible
she took no time to think, but rushed at it, and did
it without a moment's pause. She wrote a letter,
composing it hurriedly, but with great care. It
was not long, but it meant a great deal. It was
addressed, as Anne's letter, which was also of so much
importance, had been addressed, to ' Cosmo Douglas,
Esq., Middle Temple.' What could little Eose be
writing to Cosmo Douglas about ? She slid it into
her pocket when, still very much flushed and excited,
she went down to dinner, and carried it about with
her till quite late in the evening, when, meeting
Saymore with the bag which he was about to send
off to the post office, she stopped him on the stairs,
and put it in with her own hand.

This was the history of Eose's day  the day when
she had that feverish attack which alarmed all the
inhabitants of the ' Black Bull ' She herself always

said it was nothing, and happily it came to nothing.
But who could prevent a mother from being alarmed,
when her child suddenly appeared with cheeks so
flushed, and a pulse that was positively racing, Mrs.
Montfort said. However, fortunately, as the
patient herself always predicted, a night's rest set it
11 right.

Chapter XXXIII.

THE MAN OF THE PERIOD.

There is in human nature an injustice towards those
who do wrong, those who are the sinners and agents
of woe in this world, which balances a good deal of
the success of wickedness. There are plenty of
wicked persons who flourish like the green bay tree,
and receive to all appearance no recompense for their
evil ways. But, on the other hand, when a man fails
to conduct himself as he ought to do, from cowardice.
from an undue regard to prudential motives  from,
as often happens, an overweening regard for the
world's opinion  that world repays him pitilessly
with contempt and neglect, and makes no allowance
for all the pangs which he suffers, and for all the
struggles in his soul. Cosmo Douglas has had hard
measure in these pages, where, as we have pretended.

his character was understood. But even in understanding
it, we have dealt, we are aware and confess,
hardly with this nineteenth-century man, who had
done nothing more than all the canons of his age
declared it his duty to do. He erred, perhaps, in
loving Anne, and in telling her so at first ; for he
ought to have taken it into consideration that he
would not be allowed to marry her, notwithstanding
the bias towards the romantic side of such questions
which the world professes in words. But then he
was led astray by another wave of popular opinion,
that which declares with much apparent reason that
the race of cruel fathers is as extinct as the dodo,
and that no girl is ever really prevented, if she
chooses to stick to him, from marrying ' the man
of her heart.' Cosmo had believed this devoutly till
he was forced by events to take up a different
opinion ; and from that moment every impartial
observer must allow that he acted up to the highest
tenets of the modern creed. As soon as he perceived
that it was really likely that Anne would be deprived
of her fortune in consequence of her adherence to-him,

he did everything a man could do, within the
limits permitted to a gentleman of the period, to
induce her to decide for her own advantage and
against himself. He could not say in so many words,
You must keep your fortune, and throw me over ;
I shall not mind it.' But he as near said it as a
person of perfectly good manners could do. It is
not for a man to take the initiative in such a case,
because women, always more foolish than men, are
very likely to be, piqued on the side of their generosity,
and to hold all the more strenuously to a self-denying
lover, the more he does not wish to bind
them. In this point his position was very difficult,
very delicate, as any one may perceive ; and when, in
spite of all his remonstrances, and hints, and suggestions,
Anne's sacrifice was accomplished, and she was
actually cast off by her angry father, with no fortune,
and nothing to recompense her but the attachment
of a barrister without occupation, and an empty engagement
to him, which it was impossible in present
circumstances to carry out, it would be difficult to
imagine anything more embarrassing than his

position. She had made this sacrifice, which he
did not wish, for him ; had insisted on making it,
notwithstanding all that he could venture to say ;
and now of course looked to him for gratitude, for
requital, and an impassioned sense of all that she
had done and relinquished for him, notwithstanding
that it was the very last thing in his mind that she
should relinquish anything for him. What was he todo?


If the man was exasperated, was there much
wonder ? He could no more, according to his tenets,
throw her over than he could marry her. Both were
alike impossible. It was strictly according to the
laws of society that a man should decline to marry
when he had nothing to marry upon ; but it was not
consistent with those laws (at least according to the
interpretation of them accepted by men of Cosmo's
type) that he should throw the lady over as soon as
she had lost her fortune. Here accordingly arose a
dilemma out of which it was impossible to come unharmed.
Cosmo's very heart was impaled upon these
forks. What could he do? He could not marry

upon nothing, and bring this wife down to the position
of a household drudge, which was all, so far ashe
knew, that would be practicable. For Anne's
sake this was out of the question. Neither could he
say to her honestly, ' You are poor and I am poor,
and we cannot marry.' What could he do? He
was blamed, blamed brutally, and without consideration,
by most of the people round ; people like
the Ashleyss, for instance, who would have plunged
into the situation and made something of it one way
or another, and never would have found out what its
characteristic difficulties were. But to Cosmo those
difficulties filled up the whole horizon. What was
he to do ? How was he to do it ? To plunge himself
and Anne into all the horrors of a penniless
marriage was impossible, simply impossible ; and to
separate himself from her was equally out of the
question. If the reader will contemplate the position
on all sides, he will, I am sure, be brought to see
that, taking into account the manner of man Cosmo
was, and his circumstances, and all about him, the
Tray in which he did behave, perplexedly keeping up

Id is relations with her family, showing himself as
useful as possible, but keeping off all too familiar
consultations, all plans and projects for the future,
was really the only way open to him. He was not
romantic, he was not regardless of consequences;
being a man of his time how could he make himself
so ? and what else could he do ?

When he received one day quite suddenly, without
any preparation, that letter which Anne had
given to Mr. Ashley to read, it came upon him like
a thunderbolt. I cannot take upon me to say that
after the first shock he was surprised by it or found
it unnatural; he did not experience any of these
feelings. On the contrary, it was, so far as T know,
after, as has been said, the first shock, a relief to his
mind. It showed him that Anne, too, had perceived
the situation and accepted it. He was startled by
her clear-sightedness, but it gained his approbation
as the most sensible and seemly step which she
could have taken. But, all the same, it hurt him
acutely, and made him tingle with injured pride and
shame. It does not come within the code of manhood,

which is of longer existence than the nineteenth
century, that a woman should have it in her
power to speak so. It gave him an acute pang. It
penetrated him with a sense of shame ; it made him
feel somehow, to the bottom of his heart, that he was
an inferior kind of man, and that Anne knew it.
It was all according to the canons of the situation,
just as a sensible woman should have behaved; just
as his own proceedings were all that a sensible man
could do ; but it hurt him all the same. The letter,
with that calm of tone which he suspected to mean
contempt, seemed to him to have been fired into him
with some sharp twanging arrow ; where it struck
it burnt and smarted, making him small in his own
esteem, petty and miserable ; notwithstanding which
he had to reply to it ' in the same spirit in which it
was written '  to use a phrase which was also of his
time. He did this, keeping up appearances, pretending
to Anne that he did not perceive the sentiments
which her letter veiled, but accepted it as the
most natural thing in the world. It may be as well
to give here the letter which he wrote in reply : 

Dearest Anne,  Your letter has indeed been a
surprise to me of the most dolorous kind.

Yes, I understand. There is no need, as you say,
for explanations  six words, or six hundred, would
not be enough to say what I should have to say, if I
began. But I will not. I refrain from vexing you
with protestations, from troubling you with remonstrances.
Circumstances are against me so heavily,
so overwhelmingly, that nothing I could say would
appear like anything but folly in the face of that
which alone I can do. I am helpless  and you are
clear-sighted, and perceive the evils of this long suspense,
without allowing your clearer judgment to be
flattered, as mine has been, by the foolishness of
hope.

What then can I say ? If I must, I accept your
decision. This is the sole ground on which it can be
put. I will not bind you against your will  that is
out of the question, that is the one thing that is impossible.
I will never give up hope that some
change may come in the circumstances or in your
resolution, till  something happens to show me that

VOL. III. N

no change can come. Till then, I do not call myself
your friend, for that would be folly. I am more
than your friend, or I am nothing but I will sign
myself yours, as you are, without any doubt, the
woman whom I will always love, and admire, and
reverence, beyond any woman in the world.

'Cosmo Douglas.'

And this was all quite true. He did love and
admire her more than any one in the world. It was
the curse of his training that he knew what was best
when he saw it, and desired that : though often men
of his kind take up with the worst after, and are
contented enough. But Anne was still his type of
perfection  she was beautiful to him, and sweet and
delightful  but she was not possible. Is not that
more than any beauty or delight ? And yet, notwithstanding
the acute pangs which he suffered, I don't
suppose one individual out of a hundred who reads
this history will be sorry for Cosmo. They will be
sorry for Anne, who does not want their sorrow half
so much.

He had a very melancholy time after the Mountfords
went away. He had not accepted any invitations
for August, being, indeed, in a very unsettled
mind, and not knowing what might be required of
him. He stayed in his chambers, alone with many
thoughts. They were gone, and Anne had gone out
of his life. It was a poor sort of life when he looked
at it now, with the light of her gone, yet snowing, at
the point where she departed, what manner of existence
it had been and was : very poor, barren, unsatisfactory
 yet the only kind of life that was
possible. In the solitude of these early August days
he had abundance of time to think it over. He
seemed to be able to take it in his hand, to look at
it as a spectator might. The quintessence of life in
one way, all that was best in the world made tributary
to is perfection  and yet how poor a business !
And though he was young, it was all he would ever
come to. He was not of the stuff, he said to himself,
of which great men are made. Sooner or later, no
doubt, he would come to a certain success. He would
get some appointment ; he would have more to live

upon ; but this would not alter his life. If Anne
had kept her fortune, that might have altered it;
or if he could in any way become rich, and go after
her and bring her back while still there was time.
But, short of that, he saw no way to make it different.
She was right enough, it was impossible ; there was
nothing else to be said. Yet while he arrived at
this conclusion he felt within himself to the bottom
of his heart what a paltry conclusion it was. A man
who was worth his salt would have acted otherwise ;
would have shown himself not the slave but the
master of circumstances. Such men were in the
backwoods, in the Australian bush, where the primitive
qualities were all in all, and the graces of
existence were not known. Out of the colonies,
however, Cosmo believed that his own was about the
best known type of man, and what he did, most men,
at least in society, would have done. But he did
not feel proud of himself.

The Mountfords had not been away a week when
he received another letter which made his heart
jump, though that organ was under very good

control, and did not give him the same trouble that
hearts less experienced so often give to their
possessors. The post-mark, Hunston, was in itself
exciting, and there was in Rose's feeble handwriting
that general resemblance to her sister's which so
often exists in a family. He held it in his hand and
looked at it with a bewildered sense that perhaps his
chances might be coming back to him, and the
chapter of other life reopening. Had she relented ?
Was there to be a place of repentance allowed him ?
He held the letter in his hand, not opening it for
the moment, and asking himself if it were so,
whether he would be happy, or  the reverse. It
had been humiliating to come to an end of the
dream of brighter things, but  would it not be
rather inconvenient that it should be resumed again ?
These were his reflections, his self-questionings,
before lie opened the letter. But when he did open
it, and found that the letter was not from Anne but
Eose Montfort, the anticlimax was such that he
laughed aloud. Little Eose ! he had paid her a great
deal of attention, and made himself something of a

slave to her little caprices, not for any particular
reason, though, perhaps, with a sense that an heiress
was always a person to please, whoever she might be.
What could little Rose want with him ? to give him
a commission  something to buy for her, or to
match, or one of the nothings with which some girls
have a faculty for keeping their friends employed.
He began to read her letter with a smile, yet a
pang all the same in the recollection that this was
now the only kind of communication he was likely
to have from the family. Not Anne : not those
letters which had half vexed, half charmed him with
their impracticable views, yet pleased his refined taste
and perception of beauty. This gave him a sharp
prick, even though it was with a smile that he unfolded
the letter of Eose.

But when he read it he was brought to himself
with a curious shock. What did it mean? Eose's
letter was not occupied with any commissions, but
was of the most startling character, as follows : 

Dear Mr. Douglas,  I am writing to you quite

secretly  nobody knows anything about it - and I
hope at least, whatever you do, that you will keep
naysecret, and not let Anne know, or mamma.

I feel quite sure, though nobody has said a word,
that Anne and you have quarrelled  and I am so
sorry ; I don't know if she thought you neglected
her and paid too much attention to us. I am quite
sure you never meant anything by it. But what I
want to say is, that I hope you won't pay attention
if she is cross. Bo make it up, and get married to
Anne. You know all the money has been left to me,
but if you marry, I will promise faithfully to give
her a part of it, say a quarter, or even a third, which
would be enough to make you comfortable. Mr.
Loseby proposed this to me some time ago, and I
have quite made up my mind to it now. I will give
her certainly a quarter, perhaps a third, and this
ought to be enough for you to marry on. I can't doit
till I come of age, but then you may be sure, if
you are married that I will make a new will directly
and settle it so. The first thing is that you should

be married, Anne and you. I wish for it very much
now.

Be sure, above everything, that you don't let out
that I have written to you, ever, either to Anne or
mamma.

Yours very truly,

Rose Montfort.'

This letter filled Cosmo with consternation, with
derision, with sharp irritation, yet such a sense of
the absurdity, as made him laugh in the midst of
all his other sentiments. For a moment the thought,
the question, glanced across his mind. Could it be,,
however distantly, however unconsciously, inspired
by Anne ? But that was not to be believed : or could
Mrs. Montfort, wanting perhaps to get rid of her
stepdaughter's supervision, have put this idea of
intermeddling into Rose's head ? But her anxiety
that her secret should be kept seemed to clear the
mother ; and as for Anne I That much he knew
however he might be deceived in any other way.
He read it over again, with a sense of humiliation

and anger which mastered his sense of the absurdity.
This little frivolous plaything of a girl to interfere
in his affairs ! It is true, indeed, that if this assurance
had been conveyed to him in a serious way,
becoming its importance, say by Mr. Loseby himself,,
and while there was yet time to make everything
comfortable, it would have been by no means an
unpleasant interference to Cosmo. He could not
but think what a difference it might have made if
only a month back, only a fortnight back, this information
had been conveyed to him. But now that
it was perfectly useless, now that Anne's letter and
his own reply had entirely closed the matter between
them, to have this child push in with her little impertinent
offer  her charity to her sister ! Rose
bestowing a quarter of her fortune upon Anne  the
younger graciously affording a provision to the elder !
By Jove ! Cosmo said to himself, with an outburst of
fury. Rose, a creature like Rose, to have it in her
power thus to insult Anne ! He was himself detached
from Anne, and never more would there be any contact
between them. Still it was in his power to

avenge her for once in a way. Cosmo did not pause,
for once in his life, to think what was prudent, but
;stretched out his hand for paper and ink, and
immediately indited his reply : 

My dear little Miss Eose,  Your letter is very
Tiind ; it makes me feel as if I were a prince in a
fairy tale, and you the good fairy, removing the
obstacles from my way ; but, unfortunately, there
were not any obstacles in my way of the kind you
suppose, and your present of part of your fortune tome,
which seems to be what you mean, though
carried out through your sister, is, I fear, a sort of
thing that neither the respectable Mr. Loseby nor
any other lawyer would sanction. It is very kind of
you to wish to gratify me with so much money, but,
alas ! I cannot take it  unless, indeed, you were to
give me the whole of it, along with your own pretty
little hand, which T should not at all object to. Are
you quite, quite sure I never " meant anything " by
the attention I paid you ? Perhaps I meant all the
time to transfer my affections from one sister to the

other, from the one without any money to the one
with a fortune, which she can afford to divide into
four or even three parts. Think over it again, and
perhaps you will find out that this was in my mind
all the time. But, short of this, I fear there is not
much ground for a commercial transaction of any
kind between you and me.

Your obedient servant to command,

C. Douglas.'

This was the revenge he took upon Eose for her
impertinence : it was mere impertinence, he supposed.
Once, and once only, it crossed his mind
that she might have had a motive for her anxiety
that he should marry her sister. But how could
that be ? It was an impossibility. And notwithstanding
the miserable way in which you will say he
had himself behaved, his furious indignation at this
patronage of Anne by Rose shows how real was still
the love and better worship for Anne that was in his
heart.

And when he had satisfied his temper by this

letter, he sat and thought of Anne. Would it have
been well with this support behind to have ventured,,
perhaps, and been bold, and knit their lives together
? Rose's guarantee, though the offer irritated
him so much, would have made that possible which
at present was impossible. Would the game have
been worth the candle ? He sat and thought over it
for a long time in the darkening evening and sighed.

On the whole, perhaps, as things stood And

then he went out to his club to dine. Not proud
of himself  far from proud of himself  feeling on

the whole a poor creature  and yet Perhaps,,

as things stood, it was just as well.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

THE heiress's TRIAL.

Rose's letter to Cosmo had been conceived in a sudden
commotion of feeling, in which her instincts and
sensations had come uppermost, and got almost out of
her own control. That savage sense of property
which exists in unreasoning childhood had risen to
flame and fire within her, mingled with and made still
more fmious by the terror and panic of possible loss.
Beneath all her gentleness and smoothness, and the
many glosses of civilisation that clothed her being.
Rose had an entirely primitive nature, tenacious of
every personal belonging, full of natural acquisitiveness
and a love of having which children and savages
share with many highly cultivated persons. She was
one of those who, without any conscious evil meaning,
are rendered desperate by the idea of personal loss.

Her first impulse, when she knew that her ' rights '
were in clanger, was to fight for them wildly, to turn
upon all assailants with impassioned fury. She did
not want to hurt any one, but what she had got she
meant to keep. The idea of losing the position to
which she had been elevated, and the fortune which
had made her for the last year so much more
important a person than before, filled her with a
kind of cruel panic or fierce terror which was ready
to seize at any instrument by which its enemies could
be confounded. This fierce passion of fear is apt todo
more mischief than deliberate cruelty. It will
launch any thunder bolt that comes to hand, arrest
the very motion of the earth, if possible, and upset
the whole course of mortal living. It is more unscrupulous
than any tyrant. Eose was altogether
possessed by this ferocious terror. When she saw
her property and importance threatened, she looked
about her wildly to see what machinery she could
set in motion for the confusion of her enemies and
her own defence. The character of it, and the result
of it to others, seemed entirely unimportant to her if

only it could stop the danger, forestall the approaching
crisis. In the letter which she had surreptitiously
read it was stipulated that in a certain case
her inheritance was to be absolutely secure, and it
had immediately become all-important to Eose to
bring about the forbidden thing against which her
father had made so violent a stand. She took her
measures instantly, with the cunning of ignorance
and simplicity and the cruel directness of a childish
mind. That there was some difficulty between her
sister and Cosmo her quick observation had early
divined. Perhaps her vanity had whispered that it
was because he liked her best : but, on the other hand,
Eose understood the power of pecuniary obstacles, and
could feel the want of money in a much more
reasonable way than her sister, though so much her
superior, ever had done. And in either case her
appeal to Cosmo would be sovereign, she thought,
in the first heat of her panic. If he had liked her
best, he would perceive that it was hopeless. If he
had been afraid, because of the want of fortune, her
letter would reassure him. And if she could but bring

it about  make Anne unpardonable secure her own
rights'!  with a passion of hostility against everybody
who could injure her, this was what Rose
thought.

But when the letter was fairly gone, and the
machinery set in motion, a little chill crept over that
first energy of passionate self-defence. Other thoughts
began to steal in. The strength of the savage and
of the child lies in their singleness of vision. As
long as you can perceive only what you want and how
it is to be had, or tried for, everything is possible; but
when a cold breath steals upon you from here and there,
suggesting perhaps the hurt of another whom you have
really no desire to hurt, perhaps the actual wickedness
which you have no desire to perpetrate, what chills
come upon the heat of action, what creeping doubts
even of the first headlong step already taken ! Rose
had three days to reflect upon what she had done, and
those three days were not happy. She disguised her
discomposure as much as she could, avoiding the
society of her mother and sister. Anne, though she
was absorbed in occupations much more important

than anything that was likely to be involved in the
varying looks of Rose, perceived her little sister's
flightiness and petulance with a grieved consciousness
that her position as heiress and principal personage
of the family group was, now that they were in their
own country and better able to realise what it meant,
doing Rose harm; while Mrs. Montfort set it
down to the girl's unreasonable fancy for little
Keziah, whose company she seemed to seek on aU
occasions, and whose confidences and preparations
were not the kind of things for a young girl to
share.

No good ever comes of making intimates of your
servants,' her mother said, disturbed by Rose's uncertain
spirits, her excitedness and agitation. What
was there to be agitated about ? Once or twice the
girl, so wildly stirred in her own limited being, so full
of ignorant desperation, boldness, and terror, and at
the same time cold creeping of doubt and self-disapproval,
came pressing close to her mother's side,
with a kind of dumb overture of confidence. But
Mrs. Montfort could not understand that there was

VOL. in.

anything to tell. If there had been a lover at hand,
if Heathcote had shown his former admiration (as she
understood it) for Eose, or even if he had been coming
daily to visit them, she might have been curious,
interested, roused to the possibility that there was a
secret to tell. But what could Eose find of a nature
to be confidential about in Hunston? The thing
was incredible. So Mrs. Montfort had said with a
little impatience, ' Can't you find a seat, my dear ?
I want my footstool to myself,' when the child came
to her feet as girls are in the habit of doing. Eose
felt herself rejected and pushed aside : and Anne's
serious countenance repulsed her still more completely.
It frightened her to think that she had
been venturing to interfere in her sister's affairs.
What would Anne say ? Her panic when she thought
of this was inconceivable. It was not a passion of
fright like that with which her own possible loss had
filled her, but it was a terror that put wings to her
feet, that gave her that impulse of instant flight
and self-concealment which is the first thought of
terror. Thus the poor little undeveloped nature

became the plaything of desperate emotions, while
yet all incapable of bearing them, and not understanding
what they were. She was capable of doing
deadly harm to others on one side, and almost of
doing deadly harm to herself on the other, out of her
extremity of fear.

Cosmo's letter, however, was as a dash of cold
water in Rose's face. Its momentary effect was one
of relief. He would not do what she wanted, therefore
he never, never was likely to betray to Anne
that she had interfered, and at the same time his
refusal eased her sense of wrong-doing : but after the
first momentary relief other sensations much less
agreeable came into her mind. Her property ! her
property ! Thus she stood, a prey to all the uncertainties
 nay, more than this, almost sure that there
was no uncertainty, that danger was over for Anne,
that she herself was the victim, the deceived one.
cruelly betrayed and deserted by her father, who had
raised her so high only to abase her the lower 
and even by Anne, who had-what had Anne done ?
Was it certain. Rose asked herself, that Anne had


not herself privately read that fatal letter, and acted
upon it, though she had pretended to be so much
shocked when Rose touched it? That must have
been at the bottom of it all. Yes, no doubt that
was how it was ; most likely it was all a plot  a
conspiracy ! Anne knew ; and had put Cosmo aside
ordered him, perhaps, to pretend to like Rose
best !  bound him to wait till the three years were
over, and Eose despoiled, and all secure, when the
whole thing would come on again, and they would
marry, and cheat poor papa in his grave, and rob
Rose of her fortune! She became wild with passion
as this gradually rose upon her as the thing
.most likely  nay, more than likely, certain ! Only
this could have warranted the tone in which Cosmo
wrote. His letter was dreadful ; it was unkind, it
was mocking, it was insolent. Yes I that was the
word  insolent ! insulting ! was what it was. Why,
he pretended to propose to her !  to her ! Rose !
after being engaged to her sister ! When Rose read
it over again and perceived what even her somewhat
obtuse faculties could not miss  the con tempestuous

mockery of Cosmo's letter, she stamped her
feet with rage and despite. Her passion was too
much for her. She clenched her hands tight, and
cried for anger, her cheeks flaming, her little feet
stamping in fury. And this was the sight which
Keziah saw when she came into the room  a sight
very alarming to that poor little woman ; and, indeed,
dangerous in the state of health in which she
was.

Oh ! Miss Eose ! Miss Eose ! ' she said, with
a violent start (which was so bad for her) ; ' what
is it ? what is the matter ? '

Rose was in some degree brought to herself by
the appearance of a spectator; and, at the same
time, it was a comfort to relieve her burdened soul
by speaking to some one.

Keziah,' she said, in a great flush of agitation
and resentment, ' it is  it is a gentleman that has
been uncivil to me ! '

Oh, Miss Rose ! ' old Saymore's wife cried outwith
excitement, attaching a much more practical
meaning to the words than Rose had any insight

into. ' Oh, Miss Eose ! in our house ! Who is it ?
who is it? Only tell me, and Mr. Saymore will
turn him out of doors if it was the best customer
we have ! '

This rapid acceptance of her complaint, and
swift determination to avenge it, brought Rose still
more thoroughly to herself.

'Oh, it is not any one here. It is a gentleman
in  a letter,' Rose said ; and this subdued her. ' It
is not anything Saymore can help me about, nor you,
nor any one.'

We are only poor folks, Miss Rose,' said Keziah,
but for a real interest, and wishing you well,
there's none, if it was the Queen herself '

The ludicrousness of the comparison struck Rose,
but struck her not mirthfully  dolefully.

It is not much that the Queen can care,' she
said. 'Anne was presented, but I was never presented.
Nobody cares! What was I when Anne
was there ? Always the little one  the one that
was nobody!'

Rut, Miss Rose ! Miss Rose ! '

Keziah did not know bow to put the consolation
she wished to give, for indeed she, like everybody
else, had mourned the injustice to Anne, which
she must condone and accept if she adopted the first
suggestion of her sympathy.

You know,' she said, with a little gasp over the
renegade nature of the speech  ' you know that Miss
Anne is nobody now, and you are the one that everybody
thinks of '

Keziah drew her breath hard after this, and
stopped short, more ashamed of her own turncoat
utterance than could have been supposed: for indeed,
she said to herself, with very conciliatory
speciousness of reasoning, though Miss Anne was
the one that everybody thought of, she herself had
always thought most of Miss Rose, who was not a
bit proud, but always ready to talk and tell you
anything, and had liked her best.

Ah ! ' cried Eose, shaking her head, ' if that were
always to last ! ' and then she stopped herself suddenly,
and looked at Keziah as if there was something
to tell, as if considering whether she should

tell something. But Eose was not without prudence,
and she was able to restrain herself.

It does not matter  it does not matter, Keziah/
she cried, with that air of injured superiority which
is always so congenial to youth. ' There are some
people who never get justice, whatever they may
do.'

Little Mrs. Saymore was more bewildered than
words could say. If there was a fortunate person in
the world, was it not Miss Rose ? So suddenly enriched,
chosen, instead of Miss Anne, to have Miss
Anne's fortune, and all the world at her feet !
Keziah did not know what to make of it. But Rose,
who had no foolish consideration for other people's
feelings, left her little time for consideration.

You may go now,' she said, with a little wave of
her hand ; ' I don't want anything. I want only to
be left alone.'

I am sure. Miss Rose,' said Keziah, offended, ' I
didn't mean to intrude upon you. I wanted to say
as all the things has come home, and if you would
like to look at them, I've laid them all out in the

best room, and they do look sweet, said the little
expectant mother.

Eose had taken a great deal of interest in the
things, and even had aided in various small pieces
of needlework  a condescension which Mrs. Mount-ford
did not approve. But to-day she was in no
mood for this inspection. She shook her head and
waved her hand with a mixture of majesty and despondency.


Not to-day. I have other things to think of,
Keziah. I couldn't look at them to-day.'

This made Keziah take an abrupt leave, with
offence which swallowed up her sympathy. Afterwards
sympathy had the better of her resentment.
She went and reviewed her little show by herself,
and felt sorry for Miss Rose. It must be a trouble
indeed which could not be consoled by a sight of the
things, with all their little frills offered, and little
laces so neatly ironed, laid out in sets upon the best
bed.

When, however, Keziah had withdrawn, the want
of any one to speak to became intolerable to Eose.

She was not used to be shut up within the limits of
her own small being ; and though she could keep her
little secrets as well as any one, yet the possession
of this big secret, now that there was no longer anything
to do  snow that her initiative had failed, and
produced her nothing but Cosmo's insolent letter,
with its mock proposal  was more than she could
contain. She dared not speak to Anne, and her
mother had unwittingly repulsed her confidence. A
tingling impatience took possession of her. If Keziah
had been present  little as Keziah would have understood
it. and unsuitable as she would have been
for a confidante  Rose felt that she must have told
her all. But even Keziah was not within her reach.
She tried to settle to something, to read, to do some
of her fancy-work. For a moment she thought that
to ' practise'  a duty which in her emancipation she
had much neglected  might soothe her; but she
could only practise by going to the sitting-room
where the piano was, where her mother usually sat,
and where Anne most likely would be at that hour.
Her book was a novel, but she could not read it.

Even novels, though they are a wonderful resource
in the vigils of life, lose their interest at the moments
when the reader's own story is at, or approaching,
a crisis. When she sat down to read, one of the
phrases in Cosmo's letter would suddenly dart upon
her mind like a winged insect and give her a sting :
or the more serious words of the other letter  the
secret of the dead which she had violated  would flit
across her, till her brain could stand it no longer.
She rose up with a start and fling, in a kind of
childish desperation. She could not, would not
bear it ! all alone in that little dark cell of herself,
with no rays of light penetrating it except the most
consolatory rays, which were not light at all, but
spurts as of evil gases, and bad little savage suggestions,
such as to make another raid upon Anne's
despatch-box, and get the letter again and burn it,
and make an end of it coming into her mind against
her will. But then, even if she were so wicked as
to do that, how did she know there was not another ?
indeed. Rose was almost sure that Anne had told
her there was another  the result of which would be

that she would only have the excitement of doing
something very wrong without getting any good
from it. She sat with her book in her hand, and
went over a page or two without understanding a
word. And then she jumped up and stamped her
little feet and clenched her hands, and made faces
in the glass at Cosmo and fate. Then, in utter impatience,
feeling herself like a hunted creature, pursued
by something, she knew not what, Rose seized
her hat and went out, stealing softly down the stairs
that nobody might see her. She said to herself that
there was a bit of ribbon to buy. There are always
bits of ribbon to buy for a young lady's toilette.
She would save the maid the trouble and get it for
herself.

The tranquil little old-fashioned High Street of
a country town on an August morning is as tranquillising
a place as it is possible to imagine. It was
more quiet, more retired, and what Rose called dull,
than the open fields. All the irregular roofs  here
a high-peaked gable, there an overhanging upper
storey, the red pediment of the Queen Anne house

which was Mr. Loseby's office and dwelling, the
clustered chimneys of the almshouses  how they
stood out upon the serene blueness of the sky and
brilliancy of the sunshine ! And underneath how
shady it was, how cool on the shady side ! in what
a depth of soft shelter, contrasting with the blaze on
the opposite pavement, was the deep cavernous doorway
of the ' Black Bull,' and the show in the shop
windows, where one mild wayfarer in muslin was
gazing in, making the quiet more apparent ! A boy
in blue, with a butcher's tray upon his head, was
crossing the street; two little children in sun-bonnets
were going along with a basket between
them; and in the extreme distance was a costermonger's
cart with fruit and vegetables, which had
drawn some women to their doors. Of itself the cry
of the man who was selling these provisions was
not melodious, but it was so softened by the delight
of the still, sweet, morning air, in which there was
still a whiff of dew, that it toned down into the
general harmony, adding a not unpleasant sense of
common affairs, the leisurely bargain, the innocent

acquisition, the daily necessary traffic which keeps
homes and tables supplied. The buying and selling
of the rosy-cheeked apples and green cabbages belonged
to the quiet ease of living in such a softened,
silent place. Rose did not enter into the sentiment
of the scene ; she was herself a discord in it. In
noisy London she would have been more at home;
and yet the quiet soothed her, though she interrupted
and broke it up with the sharp pat of her high-heeled
boot and the crackle of her French muslin.
She was not disposed towards the limp untidy draperies
that are Hie fashion.' Her dress neither
swept the pavement nor was huddled up about her
knees like the curtains of a shabby room, but bellowed
about her in crisp puffs, with enough of starch ; and
her footstep, which was never languid, struck the
pavement more sharply than ever in the energy of
her discomposure. The butcher in the vacant open
shop, from which fortunately most of its contents
Lad been removed, came out to the door bewildered
to see who it could be ; and one of Mr. Loseby's
clerks poked out of a window in his shirt-sleeves,

but drew back again much confused and abashed
when he caught the young lady's eye. The clerks
in Mr. Loseby's office were not, it may be supposed,
of an order to hope from any notice from a Miss
Montfort of Mount ; yet in the twenties both boys
and girls have their delusions on that point. Rose,
however, noticed the young clerk no more than if he
had been a costermonger, or one of the cabbages that
worthy was selling : yet the sight of him gave her a
new idea. IMr. Loseby ! any Montfort of Mount
had a right to speak to Mr. Loseby, whatever trouble
he or she might be in. And Eose knew the way into
his private room as well as if she had been a child
of the house. She obeyed her sudden impulse, with
a gi-eat many calculations equally sudden springing
up spontaneously in her bosom. It would be well to
see what Mr. Loseby knew ; and then he might be
able to think of some way of punishing Cosmo : and
then  in any case it would be a relief to her mind.
The young clerk in his shirt-sleeves, yawning over
his desk, heard the pat of her high heels coming up
the steps at the door, and could not believe his ears.

He addressed himself to his work with an earnestness
which was almost solemn. Was she coming to
complain of his stare at her from the window ? or
was it to ask Mr. Loseby, perhaps, who was that
nice-looking young man in the little room close to
the door ?

Mr. Loseby's room was apt to look dusty in the
summer, though it was in fact kept in admirable
order. But the Turkey carpet was very old, and
penetrated by the sweeping of generations, and the
fireplace always had a tinge of ashes about it. Today
the windows were open, the Venetian blinds
down, and there was a soit of green dimness in the
room, in which Rose, dazzled by the sunshine out
of doors, could for the moment distinguish nothing.
She was startled by Mr. Loseby's exclamation of
her name. She thought for the moment that he
had found her out internally as well as externally,
and surprised her secret as well as herself. * Why,
little Rose ! ' he said. He was sitting in a coat
made of yellow Indian grass-silk which did not
accord sd well as his usual shining blackness with

the glistening of his little round bald head, and his
eyes and spectacles. His table was covered with
papers done up in bundles with all kinds of red
tape and bands. ' This is a sight for sore eyes,'
he said. ' You are like summer itself stepping into
an old man's dusty den ; come and sit near me and
let me look at you, my summer Rose ! I don't
know which is the freshest and the prettiest ! ' said
the old lawyer, waving his hand towards a beautiful
luxurious blossom of ' La France ' which was on his
table in a Venetian glass. He had a fancy for pretty
things.

'Oh, I was passing, and I thought I would,
come in  and see you,' Rose said.

Mr. Loseby had taken her appearance very
quietly, as a matter of course ; but when she began
to explain he was startled. He pushed his spectacles
up upon his forehead and looked at her curiously.
' Ah ! ' he said, ' that was kind of you  to
come with no other object than to see an old man.'

Oh ! ' cried Rose, confused, ' I did not say I had
no other object, Mr. Loseby. I want you to tell

VOL. III. P

me  is  is  Anne likely to settle upon the Dower-louse
? I do so want to know.'

My dear child, your mother has as much to do
with it as Anne has. You will hear from her better
than from me,'

To be sure, that is true,' said Eose ; and then,
after a pause, ' Oh, Mr. Loseby, is it really, really
true that Cosmo Douglas is not going to marry
Anne ? isn't it shameful ? to bring her into such
trouble and then to forsake her. Couldn't he be
made to marry her ? I think it is a horrid shame
that a man should behave like that and get no
punishment at all.'

Mr. Loseby pushed his spectacles higher and
higher ; he peered at her through the partial light
with a very close scrutiny. Then he rose and half
drew up one of the blinds. But even this did not
satisfy him,  Do you think then,' he said at last,
that it would be a punishment to a man to marry
Anne ? '

It would depend upon what his feelings were.

said Rose with much force of reason ; ' if he wanted,
for example, to marry  somebody else.'

Say Rose  instead of Anne,' said the acute old
lawyer, with a grin which was very much like a
grimace.

I am sure I never said that ! ' cried Rose. ' I
never, never said it, nor so much as hinted at it.
He may say what he pleases, but I never, never said
it ! you always thought the worst of me, Mr. Loseby,
Anne was always your favourite ; but you need not
be unjust. Haven't I come here express to ask
you? Couldn't he be made to marry her? Why,
they were engaged ! everybody has talked of them as
engaged. And if it is broken off, think how awkward
for Anne.'

Mr. Loseby took off his spectacles, which had
been twinkling and glittering upon his forehead
like a second pair of eyes  this was a very strong
step, denoting unusual excitement  and wiped them
deliberately while he looked at Eose. He had the
idea, which was not a just idea, that either Eose

had been exercising her fascinations upon her sister's
lover, or that she had been in her turn fascinated
by him. ' You saw a good deal of Mr. Douglas in
town ? ' he said, looking at her keenly, always
polishing his spectacles ; but Eose sustained the gaze
without shrinking.

Oh, a great deal,' she said, ' he went everywhere
with us. He was very nice to mamma and
me. Still I do not care a bit about him if he behaves
badly to Anne ; but he ought not to be let off
-he ought to be made to marry her. I told him 
what I was quite ready to do '

And what are you quite ready to do, if one
might know ? ' Mr. Loseby was savage. His grin
at her was full of malice and all uncharitableness.

'Oh, you know very well!' cried Eose, 'it was

you first who said Will you tell me one thing,

Mr. Loseby,' she ran on, her countenance changing ;
what does it mean by the will of 1868 ? '

What does what mean ? ' The old lawyer was
roused instantly. It was not that he divined anything,
but his quick instinct forestalled suspicion,

and there suddenly gleamed over him a consciousness
that there was something to divine.

Oh I  I mean,' said Eose, correcting herself
quickly, 'what is meant by the will of 1868? I
think I ought to know.'

Mr. Loseby eyed her more and more closely. * I
wonder,' he said, ' how you know that there was a
will of 1868?'

But there was nothing in his aspect to put Eose
on her guard. 'I think I ought to know,' she said,
but I am always treated like a child. And if
things were to turn round again, and everything
to go back, and me never to have any good of it, I
wonder what would be the use at all of having made
any change ? '

Mr. Loseby put on his spectacles again. He
wore a still more familiar aspect when he had his
two spare eyes pushed up from his forehead, ready
for use at a moment's notice. He was on the verge
of a discovery, but he did not know as yet what
that discovery would be.

That is very true,' he said ; ' and it shows a

great deal of sense on your part : for if everything
were to turn round it would certainly be no use at
all to have made any change. The will of 1868 is
the will that was made directly after your father
married for the second time ; it was made to secure
her mother's fortune to your sister Anne.'

Without even the least thought of me ! ' cried
Eose, indignant.

It was before you were born,' said JNIr. Loseby,
with a laugh that exasperated her.

Oh ! ' she cried, with an access of that fury
which had frightened Keziah, ' how horrible people
are ! how unkind things are ! how odious it is to beset
up and set down and never know what you are,
or what is going to happen! Did I do anything
to Cosmo Douglas to make him break off with
Anne ? is it my fault that he is not going to marry
her after all ? and yet it will be me that will suffer,
and nobody else at all. Mr. Loseby, can't it be put
a stop to ? I know you like Anne best, but why
should not I have justice, though I am not Anne ?
Oh, it is too bad ! it is cruel  it is wicked ! Only

just because papa was cross and out of temper and
another man is changeable, why should I be the one
to suffer ? Mr. Loseby, I am sure if you were to
try you could change it; you could stop us from
going back to this will of 1868 that was made before
I was born. If it was only to burn that bit of
paper, that horrid letter, that thing ! I had nearly
put it into the fire myself. Oh ! ' Rose wound up
with a little cry ; she came suddenly to herself out
of her passion and indignation, and shrank away, as
it were, into a corner, and confronted the old lawyer
with a pale and troubled countenance like a child
found out. What had she done ? She had betrayed
herself. She looked at him alarmed, abashed, in a
sudden panic which was cold, not hot with passion,
like her previous one. What could he cause to be
done to her ? What commotion and exposure might
he make ? She scarcely dared to lift her eyes to
his face; but yet would not lose sight of him
lest something might escape her which he should,
do.

Eose,' he said, with a tone of great severity, yet

a sort of chuckle behind it which gave her consolation,
'you have got hold of your father's letter to
Anne.'

Well,' she said, trembling but defiant, ' it had
to be read some time, Mr. Loseby. It was only
about us two ; why should we wait so many years
to know what was in it ? A letter from papa ! Of
course we wanted to know what it said.'

We ! Does Anne know too ? ' he cried, horrified.
And it gleamed across Rose's mind for one
moment that to join Anne with herself would be to
diminish her own criminality. But after a moment
she relinquished this idea, which was not tenable.
Oh, please ! ' she cried, ' don't let Anne know !
She would not let me touch it. But why shouldn't
we touch it ? It was not a stranger that wrote it
it was our own father. Of course I wanted to
know what he said.'

There was a ludicrous struggle on Mr. Loseby's
face. He wanted to be severe, and he wanted to
laugh. He was disgusted with Rose, yet very
lenient to the little pretty child he had known all

his life, and his heart was dancing with satisfaction
at the good news thus betrayed to him. 'I have
got a duplicate of it in my drawer, and it may
not be of much use when all is said. Since you
have broken your father's confidence, and violated
his last wishes, and laid join-self open to all sorts of
penalties, you  may as well tell me all about it,' he
said.

When Eose emerged into the street after this
interview, she came down the steps straight upon
Willie Ashley, who was mooning by, not looking
whither he was going, and in a somewhat disconsolate
mood. He had been calling upon Mrs. Montfort,
but Rose had not been visible. Willie knew it was
no use ' making a fool of himself, as he said, about
Rose ; but yet when he was within reach he could
not keep his feet from wandering where she was.
When he thus came in her way accidentally, his
glum countenance lighted up into a blaze of pleasure.
Oh, here you are ! ' he cried in a delighted voice.
I've been to Saymore's and seen your mother, but
you were not in.' This narrative of so self-evident

a fact made Rose laugh, though there were tears of
agitation and trouble on her face, which made Willie
conclude that old Loseby (confound him !) had been
scolding her for something. But when Rose laughed
all was well.

Of course I was not in. It is so tiresome there
nothing to do, nowhere to go. I can't think why
Anne wishes to keep us here of all places in the
world.'

But you are coming to the Dower-house at
Lilford ? Oh ! say you are coming, Rose. I know
some people that would dance for joy.'

What people ? I don't believe anybody cares
where we live,' said Rose with demure consciousness,
walking along by his side with her eyes cast down,
but a smile hovering about the corners of her mouth.
Confession had been of use to her, and had relieved
her soul, even though Mr. Loseby had no power to
confer absolution.

Don't we ? Well, there's Charley for one ; he
has never had a word to throw to a dog since you
went away. Though a fellow may know it is no

good, it's always something to know that you're
there.'

'What is no good?' said Rose, with extreme
innocence. And thus the two went back talking 
of matters very important and amusing  through the
coolness and sweetness and leisure of the little
country street. Anne, who was seated in the bow-window
of the sitting-room with her books and her
papers, could not help breathing forth a little sigh
as she looked out and saw them approaching, so
young and so like each other. What a pity ! ' she
said to herself. So far as she herself was concerned,
it was far more than a pity ; but even for Eose .

What is a pity ? ' said Mrs. Montfort ; and she
came and looked out over Anne's shoulder, being a
little concerned about her child's absence. When
she saw the pair advancing she flushed all over with
annoyance and impatience. ' Pity ! it must be put
a stop to,' she cried ; ' Willie Ashley was always out
of the question ; a boy with next to nothing. But
now it is not to be thought of for a moment. I rely
upon you, if you have any regard for your sister, to
put a stop to it, Anne ! '

CHAPTEK XXXV.

A SIMPLE WOMAN.

The Dower-louse at Lilford was fixed upon shortly
after by general consent. It was an old house, but
showed its original fabric chiefly in the tall stacks of
chimneys which guaranteed its hospitable hearths
from smoke, and gave an architectural distinction
to the pile of building, the walls of which were all
matted in honeysuckles, roses, and every climbing
plant that can be imagined, embroidering themselves
upon the background of the ivy, which filled every
crevice. And the pleasure of furnishing, upon which
Mr. Loseby had been cunning enough to enlarge, as
an inducement to the ladies to take possession of
this old dwelling-place, proved as great and as
delightful as he had represented it to be. It was a
pleasure which none of the three had ever as yet

experienced. Even Mrs. Montfort had never
known the satisfaction, almost greater than that of
dressing one's self  the delight and amusement of
dressing one's house and making it beautiful. She
had been taken as a bride to the same furniture
which had answered for her predecessor ; and though
in the course of the last twenty years something had
no doubt been renewed, there is no such gratification
in a new carpet or curtains, which must be chosen
either to suit the previous furniture, or of those
homely tints which, according to the usual formula
of the shops, ' would look well with anything,' as in
the blessed task of renovating a whole room at once.
They had everything to do here, new papers (bliss!
for you may be sure Mrs. Montfort was too fashionable
to consult anybody but Mr. Morris on this
important subject), and a whole array of new old
furniture. They did not transfer the things that had
been left at Amount, which would have been, Mrs.
Montfort felt, the right thing to do, but merely
selected a few articles from the mass which nobody
cared for. The result, they all flattered themselves.

was fine. Not a trace of newness appeared in all
the carefully decorated rooms. A simulated suspicion
of dirt, a ghost of possible dust, was conjured
up by the painter's skill to make everything perfect
not in the way of a vulgar copy of that precious
element which softens down the too perfect freshness,
but, by a skilful touch of art, reversing the old
principle of economy, and making ' the new things
look as weel's the auld.' This process, with all its
delicate difficulties, did the Montfort family good
in every way. To Anne it was the most salutary and
health* giving discipline. It gave her scope for the
exercise of all those secondary tastes and fancies,
which keep the bigger and more primitive sentiments
in balance. To be anxious about the harmony
of the new curtains, or concerned about the carpet, is
sometimes salvation in its way ; and there were so
many questions to decide  things for beauty and
things for use  the character of every room, and the
meaning of it, which are things that have to be studied
nowadays before we come so far down as to consider
the conveniences of it, what you are to sit upon, or lie

upon, though these two are questions almost of life
and death. Anne was plunged into the midst of all
these questions. Besides her serious business in the
management of the estate which Mr. Loseby had
taken care should occupy her more and more, there
were a hundred trivial play-anxieties always waiting
for her, ready to fill up every crevice of thought.
She had, indeed, no time to think. The heart which
had been so deeply wounded, which had been compelled
to give up its ideal and drop one by one the
illusions it had cherished, seemed pushed into a
corner by this flood of occupation. Anne's mind,
indeed, was in a condition of exhaustion, something
similar to that which sometimes deadens the sensations
of mourners after a death which in anticipation has
seemed to involve the loss of all things. When allis
over, and the tortures of imagination are no longer
added to those of reality, a kind of calm steals over
the wounded soul. The worst has happened; the
blow has fallen. In this fact there is quiet at least
involved, and now the sufferer has nothing to think
of but how to bear his pain. The wild rallying of

all his forces to meet a catastrophe to come is no
longer necessary. It is over ; and though the calm
may be but ' a calm despair,' yet it is different from
the anguish of looking forward. And in Anne's
case there was an additional relief. For a long time
past she had been forcing upon herself a fictitious
satisfaction. The first delight of her lovCjWhich she
had described to Eose as the power of saying
everything to her lover, pouring out her whole heart
in the fullest confidence that everything would
interest him and all be understood, had long ago
begun to ebb away from her. As time went on, she
had fallen upon the pitiful expedient of writing to
Cosmo without sending her letters, thus beguiling
herself by the separation of an ideal Cosmo, always
the same, always true and tender, from the actual
Cosmo whose attention often flagged, and who sometimes
thought the things that occupied her trivial,
and her way of regarding them foolish or high-flown.
Yes, Cosmo too had come to think her high-flown :
he had been impatient even of her fidelity to himself
; and gradually it had come about that Anne's

communications with him were but carefully prepared
abridgments of the genuine letters which were
addressed to  someone whom she had lost, someone,
she could not tell who, on whom her heart could
repose, but who was not, so far as she knew, upon
this unresponsive earth. All this strain, this dual
life, was over now. No attempt to reconcile the one
with the other was necessary. It was all over ; the
worst had happened ; there was no painful scene to
look forward to, no gradual loosening of a tie once
so dear ; but whatever was to happen had happened.
How she might have felt the blank, had no such
crowd of occupations come in to fill up her time
and thoughts, is another question. But, as it was,
Anne had no time to think of the blank. In the
exhaustion of the revolution accomplished she was
seized hold upon by all these crowding occupations,
her thoughts forced into new channels, her every
moment busy. No soul comes through such a crisis
without much anguish and many struggles, but Anne
had little time to indulge herself. She had to stand
to her arms, as it were, night and day. She explained
VOL. III. Q

her position to Mr. Loseby, as has been said, and
she informed her stepmother briefly of the change :
but to no one else did she say a word.

There was silence in heaven for the space of half
an hour.' Could any word express more impressively
the pause of fate, the quiet of patience and deliberation
over the great and terrible things to come.
There was silence in the heaven of Anne's being.
She forbore to think, forbore to speak, even to herself.
All was still within her. The firmament had closed
in around her. Her world was lessened, so much cutoff
on every side, a small world now with no far-shining
distances, no long gleams of celestial light,
nothing but the little round about her, the circle of
family details the work of every day. Instead of the
wide sky and the infinite air, to have your soul concentrated
within a circle of Mr. Morris's papers, however
admirable they may be, makes a great difference in
life. Sometimes she even triumphed over circumstances
so far as to see the humorous side of her
own fate, and to calculate with a smile half pathetic,
all that her unreasonable fidelity had cost her. It

had cost her her father's approbation, her fortune, her
place in life, and oli ! strange turning of the tables !
it had cost her at the same time the lover whom she
had chosen, in high youthful absolutism and idealism,
at the sacrifice of everything else. Was there ever a
stranger contradiction, completion, of a transaction ?
He for whom she had given up all else, was lost to
her because she had given everything for him. A
woman might weep her heart out over such a fate,
or she might smile as Anne smiled, pale, with a
woful merriment, a tremulous pathetic scorn, an
indignation half lost in that sentiment which made
Othello cry out, 'The pity of it! The pity of it ! '
Oh, the pity of it ! that such things should be ; that
a woman should give so much for so little  and a
man return so little for so much. Sometimes, when
she was by herself, this smile would come up unawares,
a scarcely perceptible gleam upon her pale countenance.
' What are you smiling at, Anne ? ' her stepmother
or Rose would ask her as she sat at work.
was I smiling? I did not know  at nobody  I
myself,' she would say, quoting Desdemona this
Q 2

time. Or she would remind herself of a less dignified
simile  of poor Dick Driveller, shutting up one
street after another, in which he had made purchases
which he could not pay for. She had shut up a
great many pleasant paths for herself. Her heart
got sick of the usual innocent romance in which the
hero is all nobleness and generosity, and the heroine
all sweet dependence and faith. She grew sick of
poetry and all her youthful fancies. Even places
became hateful to her, became as paths shut up
To see the Beeches even from the road gave her a
pang. Mount, where she had written volumes all
full of her heart and inmost thoughts to Cosmos-pained
her to go back to, though she had to do it
occasionally. And she could not think of big
London itself without a sinking of the heart. He
was there. It was the scene of her disenchantment,
her disappointment. All these were as so many slices-cut
off from her life. Rose's estate, and the leases,
and the tenants, and the patronage of Lilford parish,
which belonged to it, and all its responsibilities, and
the old women, with their tea and flannels, and the

Dower-house with Mr. Morris's papers  these circumvented
and bound in her life.

But there was one person at least whose affectionate
care of her gave Anne an amusement which
now and then found expression in a flood of tears :
though tears were a luxury which she did not permit
herself. This was the Rector, who was always coming
and going, and who would walk round Anne at the
writing-table, where she spent so much of her time,
with anxious looks and many little signs of perturbation.
He did not say a great deal to her,
but watched her through all the other conversations
that would arise, making now and then a vague little
remark, which was specially intended for her, as she
was aware, and which would strike into her like an
arrow, yet make her smile all the same. When there
was talk of the second marriage of Lord Meadow-lands'
brother, the clergyman, Mr. Ashley was strong
in his defence. ' No one can be more opposed than
I am to inconsistencies of all kinds ; but when you
have made a mistake the first time it is a wise
thing and a right thing,' said the good Rector, with

a glance at Anne, ' to take advantage of the release
gi even you by Providence. Charles Meadows had made
a great mistake at first  like many others.' And
then, when the conversation changed, and the Wood-heads
became the subject of discussion, even in the
fulness of his approbation of ' that excellent girl
Fanny,' Mr Ashley found means to insinuate his
constant burden of prophecy. ' What I fear is that
she will get a little narrow as the years go on.
How can a woman help that who has no opening*
out in her life, who is always at the first chapter ? '

Dear me, Rector,' said Mrs. Montfort, ' I did
not know you were such an advocate of marriage.'

Yes, I am a great advocate of marriage : with -
out it we all get narrow. We want new interests
to carry on our life ; we want to expand in our
children, and widen out instead of closing in.'

But Fanny has not closed in,' said Anne, with a
half malicious smile, which had a quiver of pain in
it : for she knew his meaning almost better than he
himself did.

No, no, Fanny is an excellent girl. She is everything

that can be desired. But you must marry,
Anne, you must marry,' he said, in a lower tone,
coming round to the back of her chair. There was
doubt and alarm in his eyes. He saw in her that
terror of single-minded men, an old maid. Women
have greatly got over the fear of that term of reproach.
But men who presumably know their own value best,
and take more deeply to heart the loss to every
woman of their own sweet society, have a great
horror of it. And Anne seemed just the sort of
person who would not marry, having been once
disgusted and disappointed, Mr. Ashley concluded
within himself, with much alarm. He was even sofar
carried away by his feelings as to burst forth
upon his excellent son and Curate, one evening in
the late autumn, when they were returning together
from the Dower-house. They had been walking along
for some time in silence upon the dusty, silent road,
faintly lighted by some prevision of a coming moon,
though she was not visible. Perhaps the same thoughts
were in both their minds, and this mutual sympathy
warmed the elder to an overflow of the pent-up

feeling. ' Man alive 1 ' he cried out suddenly, turning-upon
Charley with a kind of ferocity, which startled
the Curate as much as if a pistol had been presented
at him. ' Man alive ! can't you go in for her ?
you're better than nothing if you're not very much.
What is the good of you, if you can't try, at least try
to please her ? She's sick of us all, and not much
wonder ; but, bless my soul, you're young, and why
can't you make an effort ? why can't you try ? that's
what I would like to know,' the Eector cried.

Charley was taken entirely by surprise. He gasped
in his agitation, ' I  try ? But she would not look
at me. What have I to offer her ? ' he said, with a
groan.

Upon which the Eector repeated that ungracious
formula. ' You may not be very much, but you're
better than nothing. No,' the father said, shaking
his head regretfully, ' we are none of us very much
to look at ; but, Lord bless my soul, think of Anne,
A nne, settling down as a single woman : an old
maid ! ' he cried, with almost a shriek of dismay. The
two men were both quite subdued, broken down by

the thought. They could not help feeling in their
hearts that to be anybody's wife would be better than
that.

But when they had gone on for about half an
hoi', and the moon had risen silvery over the roofs of
the cottages, showing against the sky the familiar
and beloved spire of their own village church,
Charley, who had said nothing all the time, suddenly
found a voice. He said, in his deep and troubled
bass, as if his father had spoken one minute ago
instead of half an hour, ' Heathcote Montfort is
far more likely to do something with her than I.'

Do you think so ? ' cried the Eector, who had
not been, any more than his son, distracted from the
subject, and was as unconscious as Charley was of the
long pause. ' She does not know him as she knows
you.'

That is just the thing,' said the Curate, with a
sigh. ' She has known me all her life, and why should
she think any more about me ? I am just Charley,
that is all, a kind of a brother ; but Montfort is a
stranger. He is a clever fellow, cleverer than I am;

and, even if he were not,' said poor Charley, with a
tinge of bitterness, ' he is new, and what he says
sounds better, for they have not heard it so often
before. And then he is older, and has been all
about the world ; and besides  well,' the Curate
broke off with a marsh little laugh, 'that is about
all, sir. He is he, and I am me  that's all.'

If that is what you think,' said the Rector, who
had listened to all this with very attentive ears,
pausing, as he took hold of the upper bar of his own
gate, and raising a very serious countenance to hi
son, ' if this is really what you think, Charley  you may
have better means of judging  we must push Mount-ford.
Anything would be better,' he said, solemnly,
than to see Anne an old maid. And she's capable of
doing that,' he added, laying his hand upon his son's
in the seriousness of the moment. ' She is capable
of doing it, if we don't mind.'

Charley felt the old hand chill him like something
icy and cold. And he did not go in with his father,
but took a pensive turn round the garden in the
moonlight. No, she would never walk with him

there. It was too presumptuous a thought. Never
would Anne be the mistress within, never would it
be permitted to Charley to call her forth into the
moonlight in the sweet domestic sanctity of home.
His heart stirred within him for a moment, then
sank, acknowledging the impossibility. He breathed
forth a vast sigh as he lit the evening cigar, which
his father did not like him to smoke in his presence,
disliking the smell, like the old-fashioned person he
was. The Curate walked round and round the
grass-plats, sadly enjoying this gentle indulgence.
When he tossed the end away, after nearly an hour
of silent musing, he said to himself, ' Montfort
might do it,' with another sigh. It was hard upon
Charley. A stranger had a better chance than himself,
a man that was nothing to her, whom she had
known for a few months only. But so it was ; and it
was noble of him that he wished Montfort no
manner of harm.

This was the state of affairs between the Rectory
and the Dower-house, which, fortunately, was on the
very edge of Lilford parish, and therefore could,

without any searchings of heart on the part of the
new Vicar there, permit the attendance of the laches
at the church which they loved. When Willie was
home at Christmas his feet wore a distinct line on
the road. He was always there, which his brother
thought foolish and weak, since nothing could ever
come of it. Indeed, if anything did exasperate the
Curate, it was the inordinate presumption and foolishness
of Willie, who seemed really to believe that
Eose would have something to say to him. Eose !
who was the rich one of the house, and whose eyes
were not magnanimous to observe humble merit like
those of her sister. It was setting that little thing
up, Charley felt, with hot indignation, as if she
were superior to Anne. But then Willie was always
more complacent, and thought better of himself than
did his humble-minded brother. As for Mr. Ashley
himself, he never intermitted his anxious watch
upon Anne. She was capable of it. No doubt she
was just the very person to do it. The Eector could
not deny that she had provocation. If a woman had
behaved to him like that, he himself, he felt, might

have turned his back upon the sex, and refused to
permit himself to become the father of Charley and
Willie. That was putting the case in a practical
point of view. The Rector felt a cold dew burst out
upon his forehead, when it gleamed across him withall
the force of a revelation, that in such a case
Charley and Willie might never have been. He set
out on the spot to bring this tremendous thought
before Anne, but stopped short and came back after
a moment depressed and toned down. How could
he point out to Anne the horrible chance that perhaps
two such paragons yet unborn might owe their nonexistence
(it was difficult to put it into words even)
to her ? He could not say it ; and thus lost out of
shyness or inaptness, he felt (for why should there
have been any difficulty in stating it), by far the
best argument that had yet occurred to him. But
though he relinquished his argument he did not get
over his anxiety. Anne an old maid ! it was a
thought to move heaven and earth.

In the meantime Heathcote Montfort felt as
warmly as anyone could have desired the wonderful

brightening of the local horizon which followed upon
the ladies' return. The Dower-house was for him also
within the limits of a walk, and the decoration and
furnishing which went on to a great extent after they
had taken possession, the family bivouacking pleasantly
in the meantime, accepting inconveniences
with a composure which only ladies are capable of
under such circumstances, gave opportunity for many
a consultation and discussion. It was no obsequious
purpose of pleasing her which made Heath cote almost
invariably agree with Anne when questions arose.
They were of a similar mould, born under the same
star, to speak poetically, with a natural direction of
their thoughts and fancies in the same channel, and
n agreement of tastes perhaps slightly owing to the
mysterious affinities of the powerful and wide-spreading
family character which they both shared. By-and-by
it came to be recognised that Anne and
Heathcote were each other's natural allies. One of
them even, no one could remember which, playfully
identified a certain line of ideas as ' our side.' When
the winter came on and country pleasures shrank as

they are apt to do, to women, within niuch restricted
limits, the friendship between these two elder members
of the family grew. That they were naturally on
the same level, and indeed about the same age,
nobody entertained any doubt, aided by that curious
foregone conclusion in the general mind (which is
either a mighty compliment or a contemptuous insult
to a woman) that a girl of twenty-one is in reality
quite the equal and contemporary, so to speak, of
a man of thirty-five. Perhaps the assumption was
more legitimate than usual in the case of these two ;
for Anne, always a girl of eager intelligence and
indiscriminate intellectual appetite, had lived much
of her life among books, and was used to unbounded
intercourse with the matured minds of great writers,
besides having had the ripening touch of practical
work, and of that strange bewildering conflict with
difficulties unforeseen which is called disenchantment
by some, disappointment by others, but which is
perhaps to a noble mind the most certain and unfailing
of all maturing influences. Heathcote Mount-ford
had not lived so much longer in the world

without having known what that experience was, and
in her groping darkly after the lost ideal, the lost
paradise which had seemed so certain and evident at
her first onset, Anne began to feel that now and
then she encountered her kinsman's hand in the
darkness with a reassuring grasp. This consciousness
came to her slowly, she could scarcely tell how ; and
whether he himself was conscious of it at all she
did not know. But let nobody think this was in the
way of overtaking or overtures to a new union.
When a girl like Anne, a young woman full of fresh
hope and confidence and all belief in the good and
true, meets on her outset into life with such a
'disappointment' as people call it, it is not alone
the loss of her lover that moves her. She has lost
her world as well. Her feet stumble upon the dark
mountains ; the steadfast sky swims round her in a
confusion of bewildering vapours and sickening giddy
lights. She stands astonished m the midst of a
universe going to pieces, like Hamlet in those times
which were out of joint. All that was so clear to
her has become dim. If she has a great courage,

she fights her way through the blinding mists,
not knowing where she is going, feeling only a dull
necessity to keep upright, to hold fast to something.
And if by times a hand reaches hers thrust out into
the darkness, guiding to this side or that, her fingers
close upon it with an instinct of self-preservation.
This, I suppose, is what used to be called catching a
heart in the rebound. Heathcote himself was not
thinking of catching this heart in its rebound. He
was not himself aware when he helped her ; but he
was dimly conscious of the pilgrimage she was
making out of the gloom back into the light.

This was going on all the winter through. Mr.
Morris's papers, and all the harmonies or discordances
of the furniture, and the struggle against too
much of Queen Anne, and the attempts to make
some compromise that could bear the name of Queen
Victoria, afforded a dim amusement, a background
of trivial fact and reality which it was go'd to be
able always to make out among the mists. Love
may perish, but the willow-pattern remains. The
foundation of the world may be shaken, but so long

VOL. III. R

as the dado is steady ! Anne had humour enough to
take the good of all these helps, to smile, and then
laugh, at all the dimly comic elements around her,
from the tremendous seriousness of the decorator, upto
the distress and perplexity of the Rector and his
alarmed perception of the possible old maid in her,
Anne herself was not in the least alarmed by the
title which made Mr. Ashley shiver. The idea of
going over all that course of enchantment once again
was impossible. It had been enchantment once  a
second time it would be  what would a second time
be ? impossible ! That was all that could be said.
It was over for her, as certainly as life of this kind is
over for a widow. To be sure it is not always over
even for a widow : but Anne, highly fantastical as
became her temper and her years, rejected with a
lofty disdain any idea of renewal. Nevertheless,
towards the spring, after the darkness had begun
to lighten a little, when she found at a hard corner
that metaphorical hand of Heathcote taking hers,
helping her across a bad bit of the road, her heart
was conscious of a throb of pleasure.

CHAPTER Xxxii.

THE LAST.

Rose's behaviour had been a trouble and a puzzle
to her family during the latter part of the year.
Whether it was that the change from the dissipation
of London and the variety of their wanderings
abroad ' to the dead quiet of country life, in which
the yomig heiress became again little Rose and
nothing more, was a change beyond the powers of
endurance, or whether it was some new spring of life
in her, nobody could tell. She became fretful and uncertain
in temper, cross to her mother, and absolutely
rebellious against Anne, to whom she spoke in a way
which even ]Mrs. Montfort was moved to declare
very unbecoming.'

You ought to remember that Anne is your elder

B 2

sister, at least, whatever else,' the rather said, who
had always been a little aggrieved by the fact that,
even in making her poor, her father had given to
Anne a position of such authority in the house.

Mamma ! ' Eose had cried, flushed and furious,
she may manage my property, but she shall not
manage me.'

The little girl talked a great deal about her property
in those days, except when Mr. Loseby was
present, who was the only person, her mother said,
who seemed to exercise any control over her. By-and-by,
however, this disturbed condition of mind
calmed down. She gave Willie Ashley a great deal
of ' encouragement ' during the Christmas holidays ;
then turned round upon him at Easter, and scarcely
knew him. But this was Rose's way, and nobody
minded very much. In short, the Curate was cruelly
consoled by his brother's misadventure. It is a sad
confession to have to make ; but, good Christian ashe
was, Charley Ashley felt better when he found
that Willie had tumbled down from confidence to
despair.

I told you you were a fool all the time,' he
said, with that fraternal frankness which is common
among brothers ; and he felt it less hard afterwards
to endure the entire abandonment in his own person
of any sort of hope.

And thus the time went on. Routine reasserted
those inalienable rights which are more potent than
anything else on earth, and everybody yielded to
them. The Mountfords, like the rest, owned that
salutary bondage. They half forgot the things
that had happened to them  Anne her disenchantments.
Rose her discovery, and Mrs. Montfort that
life had ever differed much from its present
aspect. All things pass away except dinner-time
and bed-time, the day's business, and the servants'
meals.

But when the third year was nearly completed
from iMr. Montfort's death, the agitation of past
times began to return again. Rose's temper began
to give more trouble than ever, and Mr. Loseby's
visits were more frequent, and even Anne showed a
disturbance of mind unusual to her. She explained

this to her kinsman Heathcote one autumn afternoon,
a few days before Rose's birthday. He had
asked the party to go and see the last batch of the
cottages, which had been completed  a compliment
which went to Anne's heart  according to her plans.
But Heathcote had stopped to point out some special
features to his cousin, and these two came along someway
after the others. The afternoon was soft and
balmy, though it was late in the year. The trees
stood out in great tufts of yellow and crimson
against the sky, which had begun to emulate their
hues. The paths were strewed, as for a religious
procession, with leaves of russet and gold, and the
low sun threw level lights over the slopes of the
park, which were pathetically green with the wet
and damp of approaching winter.

The season is all stillness and completion,' Anne
said ; ' but I am restless. I don't know what is the
matter with me. I want to be in motion  to do
something  from morning to night.'

You have had too much of the monotony of our
quiet life.'

Xo ; you forget T have always been used to the
country ; it is not monotonous to me. Indeed, I
know well enough what it is,' said Anne, with a
smile. ' It is Rose's birthday coming so near. I
will lose my occupation, which I am fond of  and
what shall I do ? '

I could tell you some things to do.'

Oh, no doubt I shall find something,' said Anne,
with heightened colour. 'I cannot find out from
Rose what she intends. It must be a curious sensation
for a little girl who  has never been anything
but a little girl  to come into such a responsibility
all at once.'

'But you were no older than she  when you
came into  ' said Heathcote, watching her countenance,
' all this responsibility, and other things as
well.'

I was older, a great deal, when I was born,'
said Anne, with a laugh. ' It is so different  even
to be the eldest makes a difference. I think I shall
ask Rose to keep me on as land-agent. She must
have some one.'

On your own property ; on the land which your
mother brought into the family ; on what would
have been yours but for '

Hu-ush ! ' said Anne, with a prolonged soft utterance,
lifting her hand as if to put it on his mouth ;
and, with a smile, ' never say anything of that  it
is over  it is all over. I don't mind it now ; I am
rather glad,' she said resolutely, ' if it must be faced
and we must talk of it  rather glad that it is for
nothing that I have paid the price : without any
compensation. I dare say it is unreasonable, but I
don't think there is any bitterness in my mind
Don't bring it up '

I will not  God forbid ! ' he said, ' bring bitterness
to your sweetness  not for anything in the
world, Anne ; but think, now you are free from your
three years' work, now your time will be your own,
your hands empty '

Think ! why that is what I am thinking all day
long ; and I don't like it. I will ask Eose to appoint
me her land-agent.'

I will appoint you mine,' he said. ' Anne, we

have been coming to this moment all these three
years. Don't send me away without thinking it
over again. Do you remember all that long time
ago how I complained that I had been forestalled ;
that I had not been given a chance ? And for two
years I have not dared to say a word. But see the
change in my life. I have given up all I used to
care for. I have thought of nothing but Mount
and you  you and Mount. It does not matter
which name comes first ; it means one thing. Now
that you are free, it is not Eose's land-agent but
mine that you ought to be. I am not your love,'
he said, a deep colour rising over his face, ' but you
are mine, Anne. And, though it sounds blasphemy
to say so, love is not everything ; life is something :
and there is plenty for us to do  together.'

His voice broke off, full of emotion, and for a
moment or two she could not command hers. Then
she said, with a tremor in her tone  ' Heathcote 
you are poor and I am poor. Two poverties together
will not do the old place much good.'

Is that all you know, Anne still ? They

will make the old place holy ; they will make it
the beginning of better things to come. But if it
is not possible still to sacrifice those other thoughts
I can wait, dear,' he said, hurriedly, ' I can wait.'

Then there was a little pause, full of fate. After
a time she answered him clearly, steadily. ' There
is no question of sacrifice : but wait a little. Heath-cote,
wait still a little.' Then she said with something
that tried to be a laugh. 'You are like the
Rector ; you are frightened lest I should be an old
maid.'

And then in his agitation he uttered a cry of
alarm as genuine as the Rector's, but more practical.
That you shall not be ! ' he cried suddenly, grasping
her arm in both his hands. Anne did not know
whether to be amused or offended. But after awhile
they went on quietly together talking, if not of love,
yet of what Heath cote called life  which perhaps
was not so very different in the sense in which the
word was at present employed.

Two days after was Rose's birthday. Mr. Loseby
came over in great state from Hunston, and the

friends of the family were all gathered early, the
Ashleyss and Heathcote coming to luncheon, with
Fanny Woodhead and her sister, while a great party
was to assemble in the evening. Rose herself, oddly
enough, had resisted this party, and done everything
she could against it, which her mother had set down
to simple perversity, with much reason on her side.
 Of course we must have a party,' Mrs. Montfort
said. ' Could anything be more ridiculous ? A
coming of age and no rejoicing! We should have
had a party under any circumstances, even if you
had not been so important a person.' Rose cried
when the invitations were sent out. There were
traces of tears and a feverish agitation about her as
the days went on. Two or three times she was found
in close conversation with Mr. Loseby, and once or
twice he had the look of urging something upon her
which she resisted. Mrs. Montfort thought she
knew all about this. It was no doubt his constant
appeal about the provision to be made for Anne.
This was a point upon which the sentiments of
Rose's mother had undergone several changes. Atone

time she had been very willing that a division
of the property should take place, not, perhaps, a
quite equal division, but sufficiently so to content
the world, and give everybody the impression that
Rose ' had behaved very handsomely ! ' but at another
time it had appeared to her that to settle upon
Anne the five hundred a year which had been her
allowance as the guardian of her sister's interests,
would be a very sufficient provision. She had, as
she said, kept herself aloof from these discussions
latterly, declaring that she would not influence her
daughter's mind  that Rose must decide for herself.
And this, no doubt, was the subject upon which Mr
Loseby dwelt with so much insistance. Mrs. Mount-ford
did not hesitate to say that she had no patience
with him. ' I suppose it is always the same subject,'
she said. ' My darling child, I won't interfere.
You must consult your own heart, which will be
your best guide. I might be biassed, and I have
made up my mind not to interfere.' Rose was excited
and impatient, and would scarcely listen to
her mother. ' I wish nobody would interfere,' she

cried ; ' I wish they would leave us alone, and let us
settle it our own way.'

At last the all-important day arrived. The bells
were rung in the little church at Lilford very early,
and woke Rose with a sound of congratulation, to a
day which was as bright as her life, full of sunshine
and freshness, the sky all blue and shining, the
country gay with its autumn robes, every tree in a
holiday dress. Presents poured in upon her on all
sides. All her friends, far and near, hsd remembered,
even those who were out of the way, too far
off to be invited for the evening festivities, what a
great day it was in Eose's life. But she herself did
not present the same peaceful and brilliant aspect.
Mrs. Worth had not this time been successful about
her dress. She was in a flutter of many ribbons
as happened to be the fashion of the moment, and
her round and blooming face was full of agitation,
quite uncongenial to its character. There were lines
of anxiety in her soft forehead, and a hot feverish
flush upon her cheeks. When the Alleys arrived
they were called into the library where the family

had assembled  a large sunny room filled at one end
with a great bow-window, opening upon the lawn,
which was the favourite morning-room of the family.
At the upper end, at the big writing-table which
was generally Anne's throne of serious occupation,
both the sisters were seated with Mr. Loseby and
his blue bag. Mr. Loseby had been going over his
accounts, and Anne had brought her big books, while
Rose between them, like a poor little boat bobbing
up and down helplessly on this troubled sea of
business, gave an agitated attention to all they said
to her. Mrs. Montfort sat at the nearest window
with her worsted work, as usual counting her stitches,
and doing her best to look calm and at her ease,
though there was a throb of anxiety which she did
misunderstand in her mind, for what was there to be
anxious about? The strangers felt themselves out
of place at this serious moment, all except the old
Rector, whose interest was so strong and genuine that
he went up quite naturally to the table, and drew
his chair towards it, as if he had a right to know
all about it. Heathcote Montfort stood against

the wall, near Mrs. Montfort, and made a solemn
remark to her now and then about nothing at all,
while Charley and Willie stood about against the
light in the bow-window, mentally leaning against
each other, and wishing themselves a hundred miles
away.

The group at the table was a peculiar one :
little Rose in the centre, restless, uneasy, a flush on
her face, clasping and unclasping her hands, turning
helplessly from one to the other : Mr. Loseby's
shining bald head stooped over the papers, its
polished crown turned towards the company as he
ran on in an unbroken stream of explanation and
instruction, while Anne on the other side, serene
and fair, sat listening with far more attention than
her sister. Anne had never looked so much herself
since all these troubles arose. Her countenance was
tranquil and shining as the day. She had on (the
Curate thought) the very same dress of white cashmere,
easy and graceful in its long sweeping folds,
which she wore at Lady Meadowlands' party ; but as
that was three years ago, I need not say the gown

was not identically the same. A great quietness was
in Anne's mind. She was pleased, for one thing,
with the approbation she had received. Mr. Loseby
had declared that her books were kept as no clerk
in his office could have kept them. Perhaps this
was exaggerated praise, and bookkeeping is not an
heroic gift, but yet the approbation pleased her.
And she had executed her father's trust. Whatever
might be the next step in her career, this, at least,
was well ended, and peace was in her face and her
heart. She made a little sign of salutation to
Charley and Willie as they came in, smiling at them
with the ease that befitted their fraternal relations.
A soft repose was about her. Her time of probation,
her lonely work, was over. Was there now, perhaps,
a brighter epoch, a happier life to begin ?

But Eose was neither happy nor serene ; her hot
hands kept on a perpetual manoeuvring, her face
grew more and more painfully red, her ribbons
fluttered with the nervous trembling in her  now
and then the light seemed to fail from her eyes. She
could scarcely contain herself while Mr. Loseby's

voice went on. Eose scarcely knew what she wanted
or wished. Straight in front of her lay the packet
directed in her father's hand to ]Mr. Loseby, the
contents of which she knew, but nobody else knew.
Fifty times over she was on the point of covering it
with her sleeve, slipping it into her pocket. What
was the use of going on with all this farce of making-over
her fortune to her, if that was to be produced at
the end ? or was it possible, perhaps, that it was not
to be produced? that this nightmare, which had
oppressed her all the time, had meant 'nothing after
all ? Eose was gradually growing beyond her own
control. The room went round and round with
her ; she saw the figures surrounding her darkly,
scarcely knowing who they were. Mr. Loseby's voice
running on seemed like an iron screw going through
and through her head. If she waited a moment
longer everything would be over. She clutched at
Anne's arm for something to hold fast by  her hour
had come.

They were all roused up in a moment by the interruption
of some unusual sound, and suddenly Eose

vol. III. s

was heard speaking in tones which were sharp and
urgent in confused passion. ' I don't want to hear
any more,' she said ; ' what is the use of it all ? Oh,
Mr. Loseby, please be quiet for one moment and
let me speak ! The first thing is to make a new
will'

To make your will  there is plenty of time for
that,' said the old lawyer, astonished, pushing his
spectacles as usual out of his way ; while Mrs. Mount-ford
said with a glance up from her worsted work,
My pet ! that is not work for to-day.'

Not my will  but papa's ! ' she cried. ' Mr.
Loseby, you know; you have always said I must
change the will. Anne is to have the half  I settled
it long ago. We are to put it all right. I want
Anne to have the half  or nearly the half ! ' she
cried, with momentary hesitation, ' before it is too
late. Put it all down, and I will sign ; the half, or

as near the half as Quick ! I want it all to

be settled before it is too late ! '

What did she mean by too late ? Anne put her
arm behind her sister to support her, and kissed her

with trembling lips. ' My Rosie ! ' she cried, ' my
little sister I ' with tears brimming over. Mrs.
Montfort threw down all her wools and rushed to
her child's side. They all drew close, thinking that
too late ' could only mean some fatal impression on
the girl's mind that she was going to die.

Yes, half : half is a great deal ! ' said Eose,
stammering, ' nearly half, you know  I have always
meant it. Why should I have all and she none?
And she has not married Mr. Douglas  I don't
know why. I think  but it hasn't come about  I
want everybody to know, papa made a mistake ; but
I give it to her, / give it to her ! Mr. Loseby, make
a new will, and say that half  or nearly half  is to
be for Anne. And oh! please, no more business 
that will do for to-day.'

She got up and sat down as she was speaking,
feverishly. She shook off her mother's hand on her
shoulder, gave up her hold upon Anne, drew her
hand out of the Rector's, who had clasped it, bidding
God bless her, with tears running down his old
cheeks. She scarcely even submitted to the pressure

of Anne's arm, which was round her, and did not
seem to understand when her sister spoke. ' Eose ! 
Anne was saying, making an appeal to all the bystanders,
* Do you know what she says ? She is
giving me everything back. Do you hear her  the
child ! My little Eosie ! I don't care  I don't care
for the money ; but it is everything that she is
giving me. What a heart she has ! do you hear
do you all hear ?  everything ! ' Anne's voice
of surprise and generous joy went to all their
hearts.

Mrs. Montfort made an effort to draw Eose
towards herself. ' There had better be no exaggeration
 she said the half  and it is a great thing
to do,' said the mother thoughtfully. There was
nothing to be said against it ; still half was a great
deal, and even Eose, though almost wild with excitement,
felt this too.

Yes, half  I did not mean all, as Anne seems to
think ; half is  a great deal ! Mr. Loseby, write it
all down and I will sign it. Isn't that enough 
enough for to-day ? '

Only one thing else,' Mr. Loseby said. He put
out his hand and took up the letter that was lying
innocently among the other papers. 'This letter,'
he said  but he was not allowed to go any further.
Rose turned upon him all feverish and excited,
and tore it out of his hands. ' Anne ! ' she cried,
with a gasp, ' Anne ! I can't hear any more today.'


No more, no more,' said Anne, soothingly ; ' what
do we want more, Mr. Loseby ? She is quite right.
If you were to secure the crown to me, you could not
make me more happy. My little Rose ! I am richer
than the Queen ! ' Anne cried, her voice breaking.
But then, to the astonishment of everybody. Rose
burst from her, threw down the letter on the table,
and covered her face, with a cry shrill and sharp as
if called forth by bodily pain.

You can read it, if you please,' the girl cried ;
but if you read it, I will die ! '

Mr. Loseby looked at Anne and she at him.
Something passed between them in that look, which
the others did not understand. A sudden flush of

colour covered Lier face. She said softly, ' My trust
is not over yet. What can it matter to anyone but
ourselves what is in the letter ? We have had business
enough for one day.'

And Rose did not appear at lunch. She had
been overwrought, everybody said. She lay down ina
dark room all the afternoon with a great deal of
eau de Cologne about, and her mother sitting by.
Mrs. Montfort believed in bed, and the pulling
down of the blinds. It was a very strange day :
after the luncheon, at which the queen of the feast
was absent, and no one knew what to say, the familiar
guests walked about the grounds for a little,
not knowing what to think, and then judiciously took
themselves away till the evening, while Mr. Loseby
disappeared with Anne, and Mrs. Montfort soothed
her daughter. In the evening Eose appeared in a
very pretty dress, though with pale cheeks. Anne,
who was far more serious now than she had been in
the morning, kissed her little sister tenderly, but
they did not say anything to each other. Neither
from that time to this has the subject ever been

mentioned by one to the other. The money was
divided exactly between them, and Anne gave no
explanations even to her most intimate friends.
Whether it was Eose who shared with her, or she
with Eose, nobody knew. The news stole out, and
for a little while everybody celebrated Eose to the
echo ; but then another whisper got abroad, and no
one knew what to think. As a matter of fact,
however, Mr. Montfort's two daughters divided
everything he left behind. The only indication
Anne ever received that the facts of the ease had
oozed out beyond the circle of the family, was in
the following strange letter, which she received
some time after, when her approaching marriage
to Heathcote Montfort, of Mount, was made
known : 

You will be surprised to receive a letter from me.
Perhaps it is an impertinence on my part to write.
But I will never forget the past, though I may take
it for granted that you have done so. Your father's
letter, which I hear was read on your sister's birthday,
will explain many things to you and, perhaps.

myself among the many. I do not pretend that I
was aware of it, but I may say that I divined it ; and
divining it, what but one thing in the face of all
misconstructions, remained for me to do ? Perhaps
you will understand me and do me a little justice
now. Pardon me, at least, for having troubled even
so small a portion of your life. I try to rejoice that
it has been but a small portion. In mine you stand
where you always did. The altar may be veiled and
the worshipper say his litanies unheard. He is a
nonjuror, and his rites are licensed by no authority,
civil or sacred : nor can he sing mass for any new
king. Yet in darkness and silence and humiliation,
for your welfare, happiness, and prosperity does ever
pray CD.'

Anne was moved by this letter more than it

deserved, and wondered if, perhaps ? But it

did not shake her happiness as, possibly, it was
intended to do.

And then followed one of the most remarkable
events in this story. Eose, who had always been

more or less worldly-minded, and who would never
have hesitated to say that to better yourself was
the most legitimate object in life  Eose  no longer
a great heiress, but a little person with a very good
fortune, and quite capable of making what she,
herself, would have called a good marriage 
Rose married Willie Ashley, to the astonishment
and consternation of everybody. Mrs. Montfort,
though she lives with them and is on the whole fond
of her son-in-law, has not even yet got over her surprise.
And as for the old Rector, it did more than
surprise, it bewildered him. A shade of alarm comes
over his countenance still, when he speaks of it. ' I
had nothing to do with it,' he is always ready to
say. With the Curate the feeling is still deeper
and more sombre. In the depths of his heart he
cannot forgive his brother. That Rose should have
been the one to appreciate modest merit and give it
its reward. Rose and not her sister  seems like
blasphemy to Charley. Nevertheless, there are hopes
that Lucy Woodhead, who is growing up a very nice

VOL. III. T

girl, and prettier than her sister, may induce even
the faithful Curate to change the current of his
thoughts and ways.
