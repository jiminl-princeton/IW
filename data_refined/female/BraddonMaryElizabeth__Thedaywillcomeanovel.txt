CHAPTER I.

Farewell, too  now at last 
Farewell, fair lily."

The joy-bells clashed out upon the clear, bright

air, startling the rooks in the elm-trees that showed

their leafy tops above the grey gables of the old

church. The bells broke out with sudden jubilation ;

- sudden, albeit the village had been on the alert for

S that very sound all the summer afternoon, uncertain

[p as to when the signal for that joy peal might be

cTJ given.

on

The signal had come now, given by the telegraph

or

3 wires to the old postmistress, and sent on to the

,'} expectant ringers in the church tower. The young

 couple had arrived at Wareham station, five miles

< off; and four horses were bringing them to their

VOL. I. B

honeymoon home yonder amidst the old woods of
Cheriton Chase.

Cheriton village had been on tiptoe with expectancy
ever since four o'clock, although common sense
ought to have informed the villagers that a bride and
bridegroom who were to be married at two o'clock in
Westminster Abbey were not very likely to appear at
Cheriton early in the afternoon. But the village
having made up its mind to a half holiday was glad
to begin early. A little knot of gipsies from the
last race meeting in the neighbourhood had improved
the occasion and set up the friendly and familiar
image of Aunt Sally on the green in front of the
Eagle Inn ; while a rival establishment had started
a pictorial shooting gallery, with a rubicund giant's
face and wide-open mouth, grinning at the populace
across a barrel of Barcelona nuts. There are some
people who might think Cheriton village and Cheriton
Chase too remote from the busy world and its traffic
to be subject to strong emotions of any kind. Yet
even in this region of Purbeck, cut off from the rest
of England by a winding river, and ostentatiously
calling itself an island, there were eager interests and

warm feelings, and many a link with the great world
of men and women on the other side of the stream.

Cheriton Chase was one of the finest places in the
county of Dorset. It lay south of Wareham, between
Corse Castle and Branksea Island, and in the midst
of scenery which has a peculiar charm of its own, a
curious blending of level pasture and steep hillside,
barren heath and fertile water-meadow ; here a Dutch
landscape, grazing cattle, and winding stream ; there
a suggestion of some lonely Scottish deer walk ; an
endless variety of outline ; and yonder on the steep
hilltop the gi'im stone walls and mouldering bastions
of Corse Castle, standing dark and stern against the
blue fair-weather sky or boldly confronting the force
of the tempest.

Cheriton House was almost as old as Corse in the
estimation of some of the country people. Its history
went back into the night of ages. But while the
Castle had suffered siege and battery by Cromwell's
ruthless cannon, and had been left to stand as that
arch destroyer left it, until only the outer walls of
the mighty fabric remained, with a tower or two, and
the mullions of one great window standing up above

B 2

the rest, the mere skeleton of the gigantic pile,
Cheriton House had been cared for and added to
century after century, so that it presented now a
picturesque blending of old and new, in which almost
every corridor and every room was a surprise to the
stranger.

Never had Cheriton been better cared for than by
its present owner, nor had Cheriton village owned a
more beneficent lord of the manor. And yet Lord
Cheriton was an alien and a stranger to the soil, and
that kind of person whom rustics mostly are inclined
to look down upon  a self-made man.

The present master of Cheriton was a man who
owed wealth and distinction to his own talents. He
had been raised to the peerage about fifteen years
before this day of clashing joy-bells and village rejoicing.
He had been owner of the Cheriton estate
for more than twenty years, having bought the property
on the death of the last squire, and at a time
of unusual depression. He was popularly supposed
to have got the estate for an old song ; but the old
song meant something between seventy and eighty
thousand pounds, and represented the bulk of his

wife's fortune. He had not been afraid so to swamp
his wife's dowry, for he was at this time one of the
most popular silk gowns at the equity Bar. He was
making four or five thousand a year, and he was
strong in the belief in his power to rise higher.

The purchase, prompted by ambition, and a desire
to take his place among the landed gentry, had
turned out a very lucky one from a financial point of
View, for a stone quarry that had been unworked for
more than a century was speedily developed by the
new owner of the soil, and became a source of income
which enabled him to improve mansion-house
and farms without embarrassment.

Under Mr. Dalbrook's improving hand the Cheriton
estate, which had been gradually sinking to
decay in the occupation of an exhausted race, became
as perfect as human ingenuity, combined with
judicious outlay, can make any estate. The falcon
eye of the master was on all things. The famous
advocate's only idea of a holiday was to work his
hardest in the supervision of his Dorsetshire property.
He thought of Cheriton many a time in the
law courts, as Fox used to think of St. Anne's and

his turnips amidst the debauchery of a long night's
card-playing, or in the whirl of a stormy debate.
Purbeck might have been the motto and password of
his life. He was born at Dorchester, the son of
humble shopkeeping parents, and was educated at
the quaint old stone grammar school in that good
old town. All his happiest hours of boyhood had
been spent in the Isle of Purbeck. Those watery
meadows and breezy commons and break-neck hills
had been his playground ; and when he went back
to them as a hard-headed, over-worked man of the
world, made arrogant from the magnitude of a
success which had never known check or retrogression,
the fountains of his heart were unlocked by
the very atmosphere of that fertile land where the
salt breath of the sea came tempered by the balmy
perfume of the heather, the odour of hedgerow
flowers, rosemary, and thyme.

At Cheriton James Dalbrook unbent, forgot that
he was a great man, and remembered only that his
lot was cast in a pleasant place, and that he had
the most lovable of wives and the loveliest of
daughters.

His daughter had been born at Cheriton, had
known no other country home, and had never considered
the first-floor flat in Victoria Street where
her father and mother spent the London season,
and where her father had his /;?><:? a terre all the
year round, in the light of a home. His daughter,
Juanita, was the eldest of three children born in
the old manor house. The two younger, both sons,
died in infancy ; and it seemed to James Dalbrook
that there was a blight upon his offspring, such a
blight as that which withered the male children of
Henry of England and Catherine of Arragon.
Much had been given to him. He had been allowed
to make name and fortune, he whose sole heritage
was a little crockery shop in a second-rate street of
Dorchester. He had enjoyed the lordship of broad
acres, the honours and position of a rural squire ;
but he was not to be allowed that crowning glory
for which strong men yearn. He was not to bethe
first of a long line of Barons Cheriton of
Cheriton.

After the grief and disappointment of those two
deaths  first of an infant of a few weeks old, and

afterwards of a lovely child of two years  James
Dalbrook hardened his heart for a little while
against the fair young sister who survived them.
She could not perpetuate that barony which was the
crown of his greatness ; or if by special grace her
father's title might be in after days bestowed upon
the husband of her choice  which in the event of
her marrying judiciously and marrying wealth,
might not be impracticable  it would be an alien to
his race who would bear the title which he, James
Dalbrook, had created. He had so longed for a
son, and behold two had been given to him, and
upon both the blight had fallen. When people
praised his daughter's childish loveliness he shook
his head despondently, thinking that she too would
be taken, like her brothers, before ever the bud
became a flower.

His heart sickened at thought of this contingency,
and of his heir-at-law in the event of his dying childless,
a first cousin, clerk in an auctioneer's office at
Weymouth, a sandy-haired freckled youth, without
an aspirate, with a fixed idea that he was an
authority upon dress, style, and billiards, an insupportable

young man under any conditions, but hateful
to murderousness as one's next heir. To think
of that freckled snob strutting about the estate in
years to come, blinking with his white eyelashes at
those things which had been so dear to the dead.

His wife, to whom he owed the estate, had no
relations nearer or dearer to her than the freckled
auctioneer was to her husband. There remained
for them both to work out their plans for the disposal
of that estate and fortune which was their
own to deal with as they pleased. Already James
Dalbrook had dim notions of a Dalbrook Scholarship
Fund, in which future barristers should have
their long years of waiting upon fortune made easier
to them, and for which they should bless the
memory of the famous advocate.

Happily those brooding fears were not realized ;
this time the bud was not blighted, the flower carried
no canker in its heart, but opened its petals to the
morning of life, a strong bright blossom, revelling
in sun and shower, wind and spray. Juanita grew
from babyhood to girlhood with hardly an illness,
save the regulation childish complaints, which

touched her as lightly as a butterfly's wing touches
the flowers.

Her mother was of Spanish extraction, the granddaughter
of a Cadiz merchant, who had failed in the
wine trade and had left his sons and daughters to
carve their own way to fortune. Her father had
gone to San Francisco at the beginning of the gold
fever, had been one of the first to understand the
safest way to take advantage of the situation, and
had started a wine shop and hotel, out of which he
made a splendid fortune within fifteen years. He
acquired wealth in good time to send his two
daughters to Paris for their education, and by the
time they were grown up he was rich enough to retire
from business, and was able to dispose of his
hotel and wine store for a sum which made a considerable
addition to his capital. He established
himself in a brand new first floor in one of the
avenues of the Bois de Boulogne, a rich widower,
more of an American than a Spaniard after his long
exile, and he launched his two handsome daughters
in Franco-American society. From Paris they
went to London, and were well received in that

upper middle-class circle in vhich "wealth can
generally command a welcome, and in-hicli a
famous barrister, like Mr. Dalbrook, ranks as a star
of the first magnitude. James Dalbrook was then
at the apogee of his success, a large handsome man
on the right side of his fortieth birthday. He was
not by any means the kind of man who would seem
a likely suitor for a beautiful girl of three and
twenty ; but it happened that his heavily handsome
face and commanding manner, his deep, strong
voice and brilliant conversation possessed just the
charm that could subjugate Maria Morales' fancy.
His conquest came upon him as a bewildering surprise,
and nothing could be further from his thoughts
than a marriage with the Spaniard's daughter ;
and yet within six weeks of their first meeting at a
Royal Academy soiree in the shabby old rooms in
Trafalgar Square, Mr. Dalbrook and Miss Morales
were engaged, with the full consent of her father,
who declared himself willing to give his daughter
forty thousand pounds, strictly settled upon herself,
for her dowry, but who readily doubled that sum
when his future son-in-law revealed his desire to

become owner of Cheriton, and to found a family.
Por such a laudable purpose Mr. Morales was willing
to make sacrifices ; more especially as Maria's elder
sister had offended him by marrying without his consent,
an offence which was only cancelled by her
untimely death soon after her marriage.

Juanita was only three years old when her father
was raised to the bench, and she was not more than
six when he was offered a peerage, which he accepted
promptly, very glad to exchange the name of
Dalbrook  still extant over the old shop window in
Dorchester, though the old shopkeepers were at rest
in the cemetery outside the town for the title of
Baron Cheriton.

As Lord Cheriton James Dalbrook linked himself
indissolubly with the lands which his wife's money
had bought ; money made in a 'Frisco wine shop for
the most part. Happily, however, few of Lord
Cheriton's friends were aware of that fact. Morales
had traded under an assumed name in the miners'
city, and had only resumed his patronymic on retiring
from the bar and the wine vaults.

It will be seen, therefore, that Juanita could not

boast of aristocratic lineage upon either side. Her
beauty and grace, her lofty carriage and high-bred
air, were spontaneous as the beauty of a wild flower
upon one of those furzy knolls over which her young
feet had bounded in many a girlish race with her
dogs or her chosen companion of the hour. She
looked like the daughter of a duke, although one of
her grandfathers had sold pots and pans, and the
other had kept order, with a bowie-knife and
revolver in his belt, over the humours of a 'Frisco
tavern, in the days when the city was still in its
rough and tumble infancy, fierce as a bull-pup.
Her father, who as the years went on, worshipped
this only child of his, never forgot that she lacked
that one sovereign advantage of good birth and
highly-placed kindred ; and thus it was that from her
childhood he had been on the watch for some alliance
which should give her these advantages.

The opportunity had soon offered itself. Among
his Dorsetshire neighbours one of the most distinguished
was Sir Godfrey Carmichael, a man of
old family and good estate, highly connected on the
maternal side, and well connected all round, and

married to the daughter of an Irish peer. Sir
Godfrey showed himself friendly from the hour of
Mr. Dalbrook's advent in the neighbourhood. He
declared himself delighted to welcome new blood
when it came in the person of a man of talent and
power. Lady Jane Carmichael was equally pleased
with James Dalbrook's gentle wife. The friendship
thus begun never knew any interruption till it ended
suddenly in a ploughed field between Wareham and
Swinburne, where Sir Godfrey's horse blundered at
a fence, fell, and rolled over his rider, ten years
after Juanita's birth.

There were two daughters and a son, considerably
their junior, who succeeded his father at the age of
fifteen, and who had been Juanita's playfellow ever
since she could run alone.

The two fathers had talked together of the possibilities
of the future while their children were playing
tennis on the lawn at Cheriton, or gathering
blackberries on the common. Sir Godfrey was
enough a man of the world to rejoice in the idea of
his son's marriage with the heiress of Cheriton,
albeit he knew that the little dark-eyed girl, with

the tall slim figure and graceful movements, had no
place among the salt of the earth. His own estate
was a poor thing compared with Cheriton and the
Cheriton stone quarries ; and he knew that Dal-brook's
professional earnings had accumulated into
a very respectable fortune invested in stocks and
shares of the soundest quality. Altogether his son
could hardly do better than continue to attach himself
to that dark-eyed child as he was attaching himself
now in his first year at Eton, riding his pony
over to Cheriton every non-hunting day, and
ministering to her childish caprices in all things.

The two mothers had talked of the future with
more detail and more assurance than the fathers, as
men of the world, had ventured upon. Lady
Cheriton was in love with her little girl's boyish
admirer. His frank, handsome face, open-hearted
manner, and undeniable pluck realised her ideal of
high-bred youth. His mother was the daughter of
an earl, his grandmother was the niece of a duke.
He had the right to call an existing duke his cousin.
These things counted for much in the mind of the
storekeeper's daughter. Her experience at a fashionable

Parisian convent had taught her to worship
rank ; her experience of English middle-class
society had not eradicated that weakness. And then
she saw that this fine, frank lad was devoted to her
daughter with all a boy's ardent feeling for his first
sweetheart.

The years went on, and young Godfrey Carmichael
and Juanita Dalbrook were sweethearts still  sweethearts
always  sweethearts when he was at Eton,
sweethearts when he was at Oxford, sweethearts in
union, and sweethearts in absence, neither of them
ever imagining any other love ; and now, in the westering
sunlight of this July evening, the bells of Cheriton
Church were ringing a joy-peal to celebrate their
wedded loves, and the little street was gay with floral
archways and bright-coloured bunting, and mottoes
of welcome and greeting, and Lady Cheriton' s barouche
was bringing the bride and bridegroom to their first
honeymoon dinner, as fast as four horses could trot
along the level road from quiet little Wareham.

By a curious fancy Juanita had elected to spend
her honeymoon in that one house of which she ought
to have been most weary, the good old house in

which she had heeii born, and where all her days of
courtship, a ten-years' courtship, had been spent.
In vain had the fairest scenes of Europe been suggested
to her. She had travelled enough to be indifferent
to mountains and lakes, glaciers, and fjords.

I have seen just enough to know that there is no
place like home," she said, with her pretty air of
authority. '' I won't have a honeymoon at all if I
can't have it at Cheriton. I want to feel what it is
like to have j'ou all to myself iu my own place,
Godfrey, among all the things I love. I shall feel
like a queen with a slave ; I shall feel like Delilah
with Samson. When you are quite tired of Cheriton
 and subjection, you shall take me to the
Priory ; and once there you shall be master and I
will be slave."

"Sweet mastership, tyrannous slavery," he answered,
laughing. *'My darling, Cheriton will suit
me better than any other place in the world for my
honeymoon, for I shall be near my future electors,
and shall be able to study the political situation in
all its bearings upon  the Isle of Purbeck."

Sir Godfrey was to stand for his division of the

VOL. I. C

county in the election that was looming in the distance
of the late autumn. He was very confident of
success, as a young man might be who came of a
time-honoured race, and knew himself popular in the
district, armed with all the newest ideas, too, full to
the brim of the most modern intelligence, a brilliant
debater at Oxford, a favourite everywhere. His marriage
would increase his popularity and strengthen
his position, with the latent power of that larger
wealth which must needs be his in the future.

The sun was shining in golden glory upon grey
stone roofs and grey stone walls, clothed with rose
and honeysuckle, clematis and trumpet ash  upon
the village forge, where there had been no work done
since the morning, where the fire was out, and the
men were lounging at door and window in their Sunday
clothes  upon the three or four village shops,
and the two village inns, the humble little house of
call opposite the forge, with its queer old sign, " Live
and Let Live," and the good old " George Hotel,"
with sprawling, dilapidated stables and spacious
yard, where the mail-coach used to stop in the days
that were gone.

There "was a floral arch between the Httle tavern
and the forge  a floral display along the low rustic
front of the butcher's shop  and the cottage postoffice
was converted into a bower. There were calico
mottoes flapping across the road  "Welcome to the
Bride and Bridegroom," " God Bless Them Both,"
Long Life and Happiness," and other fond and
hearty phrases of time-honoured familiarity. But
those clashing bells, with their sound of tumultuous
gladness, a joy that clamoured to the blue sides above
and the woods below, and out to the very sea yonder,
in its loud exuberance, those and the smiling faces
of the villagers were the best of all welcomes.

There were gentlefolks among the crowd  a string
of pony carts and carriages drawn up on the long slip
of waste grass beyond the forge, just where the road
turned ofi" to Cheriton Chase ; and there were two or
three horsemen, one a young man upon a fine bay
cob, who had been walking his horse about restlessly
for the last hour or so, sometimes riding half a mile
towards the station in his impatience.

The carriage came towards the turning point, the
bride bowing and smiling as she returned the greet

2

kings of gentle and simple. Emotion had paled the
delicate olive of her complexion, but her large dark
eyes were bright with gladness. Her straw-coloured
tussle gown and leghorn hat were the perfection of
simplicity, and seemed to surround her with an
atmosphere of coolness amidst the dust and glare
of the road.

At sight of the young man on the bay cob she put
her hand on Sir Godfrey's arm and said something
to him, on which he told the coachman to stop.
They had driven slowly through the village, and the
horses pulled up readily at the turn of the road.

*' Only to think of jour coming so far to greet us,
Theodore," said Juanita, leaning out of the carriage
to shake hands with the owner of the cob.

*'I wanted to be among the first to welcome you,
that was all," he answered, quietly. " I had half a
mind to ride to the station and be ready to hand you
into your carriage, but I thought Sir Godfrey might
think me a nuisance."

** No fear of that, my dear Dalbrook," said the
bridegroom. '' I should have been very glad to see
you. Did you ride all the way from Dorchester ? "

Yes ; I came over early in the morning, breakfasted
with a friend, rested the cob all day, and now
he is ready to carry me home again."

"What devotion! " said Juanita, laughingly, yet
with a shade of embarrassment.

** What good exercise for Peter, you mean. Keeps
him in condition against the cubbing begins. God
bless you, Juanita. I can't do better than echo the
invocation above our heads, ' God bless the bride and
bridegroom."

He shook hands with them both for the second
time. A faint glow of crimson swept over his
frank fair face as he clasped those hands. His
honest grey eyes looked at his cousin for a moment
with grave tenderness, in which there was the
shadow of a life-long regret. He had loved and
wooed her, and resigned her to her more favoured
lover, and he was honest in his desire for her
happiness. His own gladness, his own life, seemed
to him of small account when weighed against her
well-being.

*' You must come and dine with us before we
leave Cheriton, Dalbrook," said Sir Godfrey.

You are very good. I am off to Heidelberg
for a holiday as soon as I can wind up my office
work. I will offer myself to you later on, if I may,
when you are settled at the Priory."

Come when you like. Good-bye."

The carriage turned the corner. The crowd
burst into a cheer : one, two, three, and then
another one : and then three more cheers louder
than the first three, and the horses were on the
verge of bolting for the rest of the way to Cheriton.

Theodore Dalbrook rode slowly away from the
village festivities, rode away from the clang of the
.joy bells, and the sound of rustic triple bob majors.
It would be night before he reached Dorchester ;
but there was a moon, and he knew every yard of
high road, every grassy ride across the wide barren
heath between Cheriton and the old Roman city.
He knew the road and he knew his horse, which
was as good of its kind as there was to be found in
the county of Dorset. He was not a rich man, and
he had to work hard for his living, but he was the
son of a well-to-do father, and he never stinted the
price of the horse that carried him, and which was

something more to Theodore Dalbrook than most
men's horses are to them. It was his own familiar
friend, companion, and solace. A man might have
understood as much only to see him lean over the
cob's neck, and pat him, as he did to-night, riding
slowly up the hill that leads from Cheriton to the
wild ridge of heath above Branksea Island.

Theodore Dalbrook, junior partner in the firm of
Dalbrook & Son, Cornhill, Dorchester, was a more
distant relative of Juanita's than the sandy first
cousin in the auctioneer's office whom Lord Cheriton
had once hated as the only alternative to a
charitable endowment. The sandy youth was the
only son of Lord Cheriton' s elder brother, long
since dead. Theodore was the grandson of a certain
Matthew Dalbrook, a second cousin of Lord Cheriton's,
and once upon a time the wealthiest and
most important member of the Dalbrook family.
The humble-minded couple in the crockery shop had
looked up to Matthew Dalbrook, solicitor, with a
handsome old house in Cornhill, a smart gig, a stud
of three fine horses, and half the county people for
his clients. To the plain folks behind the counter,

who dined at one and supped on cold meat and
pickles and Dutch cheese at nine of the clock, Mr.
Dalbrook, the lawyer, was a great man. They
were moved by his condescension when he dropped
in to the five o'clock tea, and talked over old family
reminiscences, the farmhouse on the Weymouth
Boat, which was the cradle of their race, and where
they had all known good days while the old people
were alive, and while the homestead was a family
rendezvous. That he should deign to take tea and
water cresses in the little parlour behind the shop,
he who had a drawing-room almost as big as a
church, and a man servant in plain clothes to wait
upon him at his six o'clock dinner, was a touching
act of humility in their eyes. When their younger
boy brought home prizes and certificates of all kinds
from the grammar school it was from Matthew
they sought advice, modestly, and with the apprehension
of being deemed over-ambitious.

I'm afraid he's too much of a scholar for the
business," said the mother, shyly, looking fondly
at her tall overgrown son, pallid with rapid growth
and overmuch Greek and Latin.

"Of course he is; that boy is too good to sell
pots and pans. You must send him to the university,
Jim."

Jim, the father, looked despondently at James,
the son. The University meant something awful in
the crockery merchant's mind; a Last expenditure
of money ; dreadful hazards to religion and morals ;
friendships with dukes and marquises, whose influence
would alienate the boy from his parents,
and render him scornful of the snug back parlour,
with his grandfather's portrait over the mantelpiece,
painted in oils by a gifted townsman, who had once
had a picture Very nearly hung in the Royal
Academy.

I couldn't afford to send him to college," he
said.

Oh, but you must afford it. I must help you, if
you and Sarah haven't got enough in an old stocking
anywhere  as I dare say you have. My boys
are at the University, and they didn't do half as well
at the grammar school as your boy has done. He
must go to Cambridge, he must be entered at
Trinity Hall, and if he works hard and keeps steady

he needn't cost you a fortune. You would work,
eh, James ? "

Wouldn't I just, that's all," James replied with
emphasis.

His heart had sickened at the prospect of the
crockery business ; the consignments of pots and
pans ; the returned empties, invoices, quarterly accounts,
matching, rivetings, dust, straw, dirt, and
degradation. He could not see the nobility of labour
in that dusty shop, below the level of the pavement,
amid ewers and basins, teacups and beer jugs,
sherries and ports. But to work in the University
hard by that great college where Bacon had
worked, and Newton, and a host of the mighty dead,
and where Wheel, a self-made man, was still
head  to work among the sons of gentlemen, and
with a view to the profession of a gentleman. That
would be labour for which to live ; for which to die,
if need be.

*' If  if mother and me were to strain a print,"
mused the crockery man, who was better able to
afford the University for his son than many a gentleman
of Dorset whose boys had to be sent there,

willy nilly, "if mother and me that have worked so
hard for our money was willing to spend a goodish
bit of it upon sending him to college, what are we todo
with him after we've made a fine gentleman of
him ? Thais where it is, you see. Mat."

*' You are not going to make a fine gentleman of
him. God forbid. If he does well at Cambridge
you can make a lawyer of him. Trinity Hall is the
nursery of lawyers. You can article him to me ;
and look you here, Jim, if I don't have to help you
pay for his education, I'll give him his articles.
There, now, what do you say to that ? "

The osier was pronounced a generous one, and
worthy of a blood relation ; but James Dalbrook
never took advantage of his kinsman's kindness.
His University career was as successful as his progress
at the quaint stone grammar school, and his
college friends, who were neither dukes nor marquises,
but fairly sensible young men, all advised
him to apply himself to the higher branch of the
law. So James Dalbrook, of Trinity Hall, ate his
dinners at the Temple during his last year of undergraduate
life, came out seventh wrangler, was called

to the Bar, and in due course wore crimson, velvet,
and ermine, and became Lord Cheriton, a man
whose greatness in sometime overshadowed the
small provincial dignity of the house of Matthew
Dalbrook, erstwhile head of the family.

The Dalbrooks, of Dorchester, had gone upon
their way quietly, thriving, respected, but in no wise
distinguished. Matthew, junior, had succeeded his
father, Matthew, senior, and the firm in Cornhill
had been Dalbrook & Son for more than thirty
years; and now Theodore, the eldest of a family
of five, was Son, and his grandfather, the founder
of the firm, was sleeping the sleep of the just in
the cemetery outside Dorchester.

Lord Cheriton was too wise a man to forget old
obligations or to avoid his kindred. There was
nothing to be ashamed of in his connection with a
thoroughly reputable firm like Dalbrook & Son.
They might be provincial, but their name was a
synonym for honour and honesty. They had taken
as firm root in the land as the county families whose
title-deeds and leases, wills and codicils they kept.
They were well-bred, well-educated, God-fearing

people, with no struggling ambitions, no morbid
craving to get upon a higher social level than the
status to which their professional position and their
means entitled them. They rode and drove good
horses, kept good servants, lived in a good house,
visited among the county people with moderation,
but they made no pretensions to being *' smart."
They offered no sacrifices of fortune or self-respect
to the modern Moloch  Fashion.

There was a younger sou called Harrington,
destined for the Church, and with advanced views
upon church architecture and music, and there were
two unmarried daughters, Janet and Sophia, also
with advanced views upon the woman's rights question,
and with a sovereign contempt for the standard
young lady.

Theodore's lines were marked out for him with
inevitable precision. He had been taken into
partnership the day he was out of his articles, and
at seven-ands twenty he was his father's right hand,
and represented all that was modern and popular in
the firm. He was steady as a rock, had an intellect
of singular acuteness, a ready wit, and very pleasing

manners. He had, above all things, the inestimable
gift of an equable and happy temper. He had been
everybody's favourite from the nursery upwards,
popular at school, popular at the University, popular
in the local club, popular in the hunting field ; and
it was the prevailing opinion of Dorchester that he
ought to marry an heiress and make a great position
for the house of Dalbrook. Some people had gone
so far as to say that he ought to marry Lord
Cheriton's daughter.

He had been made free of the great house at
Cheriton from the time he was old enough to visit
anywhere. His family had been bidden to all notable
festivities ; had been duly called upon, at not
too long intervals, by Lady Cheriton. He had
ridden by Juanita's side in many a run with the
South Dorset foxhounds, and had waited about with
her outside many a covert. They had pic-nicked
and made gipsy tea at Corse Castle; they had
rambled in the woods near Studland ; they had
sailed to Branksea, and, further away, to Walworth
Cove, and the romantic caves of Stare ; but this
had been all in frank cousinly friendship. Theodore

had seen only too soon that there was no room for
him in his kinswoman's heart. He began by
admiring her as the loveliest girl he had ever seen ;
he had ended by adoring her, and he adored her
still ; but with a loyal regard which accepted her
position as another man's wife ; and he would have
died sooner than dishonour her by one unholy
thought.

It was nearly ten o'clock when he rode slowly
along the avenue that led into Dorchester. The
moon was shining between the overruling boughs
of the sycamores. The road with that high over-arching
roof had a solemn look in the moonlit stillness.
The Roman amphitheatre yonder, with its
grassy banks rising tier above tier, shone white in
the moonbeams ; the old town seemed half asleep.
The house in Cornhill had a very Philistine look as
compared with that fine old mansion of Cheriton
which was present to his mind in very vivid colours
to-night, those two wandering about the old Italian
garden, hand-in-hand, wedded lovers, with the
lamplight rooms open to the soft summer night, and
the long terrace and stone balustrade and moss-grown

statues of nymph and goddess silvered by
the moonbeams. The Cornhill house was a good
old house notwithstanding, a panelled house of the
Georgian era, with a wide entrance hall, and a well-staircase
with carved oak balusters and a baluster
rail a foot broad. The furniture had been very
little changed since the days of Theodore's great-grandfather,
for the late Mrs. Dalbrook had
cherished no yearnings for modern art in the
furniture line. Her gentle spirit had looked up to
her husband as a leader of men, and had reverenced
chairs and tables, bureaus and wardrobes that had
belonged to his grandfather, as if they were made
sacred by that association. And thus the good old
house in the good old town had a savour of bygone
generations, an old family air which the parvenu
would buy for much gold if he could. True that
the dining-room chairs were over-ponderous, and
the dining-room pictures belonged to the obscure
school of religious art in which you can only catch
your saint or your martyr at one particular angle ;
yet the chairs were of a fine antique form, and bore
the crest of the Dalbrooks on their shabby leather

backs, and the pictures had a respectable brownness
which might mean Holbein or Rembrandt.

The drawing-room was large and bright, with
four narrow, deeply-recessed windows commanding
the broad street and the Antelope Hotel over the
way, and deep window seats crammed with flower?.
Here the oak panelling had been painted pale pink,
and the mouldings picked out in a deeper tint by
successive generations of Vandals, but the effect
was cheerful, and the pink walls made a good background
for the Chippendale secretaires and cabinets
filled with willow-pattern Worcester or Crown
Derby. The window curtains were dark brown
cloth, with a border of Berlin wool lilies and roses,
a border which would have set the teeth of an
aesthete on edge, but which blended with the general
brightness of the room. Old Mrs. Matthew Dal-brook,
the grandmother, and her three spinster
daughters had toiled over those cross-stitch borders,
and Theodore's mother would have deemed it sacrilege
to have put aside this labour of a vanished life.

Harrington Dalbrook and his two sisters were in
the drawing-room, each apparently absorbed in an

VOL. I. D

instructive book, and yet all three had been talking
for the greater part of the evening. It was a characteristic
of their highly intellectual lives to nurse a
volume of Herbert Spencer or a treatise upon the
deeper mysteries of Buddha, while they discussed
the conduct or morals of their neighbours  or their
gowns and bonnets.

*' I thought you were never coming home, The,"
said Janet. " You don't mean to say you waited to
see the bride and bridegroom ? ' '

* That is exactly what I do mean to say. I had
to get old Sundown's lease executed, and when I had
finished my business I waited about to see them
arrive. Do you think you could get me anything in
the way of supper, Janie ? "

*' Father went to bed ever so long ago," replied
Janet ; ** it's dreadfully late."

But I don't suppose the cook has gone to bed,
and perhaps she would condescend to cut me a sandwich
or two," answered Theodore, ringing the bell.

His sisters were orderly young women who objected
to eating and drinking out of regulation hours. Janet
looked round the room discontentedly, thinking that
her brother would make crumbs. Young men she

had observed, are almost miracle workers in the way
of crumbs. They can get more superfluous crumbs
out of any given piece of bread than the entire piece
would appear to contain, looked at by the casual eye.

I have found a passage in Spencer which most
fully bears out my view, Theodore," said Sophia,
severely, referring to an argument she had had with
her brother the day before yesterday.

How did she look ? " asked Janet, openly frivolous
for the nonce.

'lovelier than I ever saw her look in her life,"
answered Theodore. " At least I thought so."

He wondered, as he said those words, whether it
had been his own despair at the thought of having
irrevocably lost her which invested her familiar
beauty with a new and mystic power. " Yes, she
looked exquisitely lovely, and completely happy  an
ideal bride."

*' If her nose were a thought longer her face would
be almost perfect," said Janet. "How was she
dressed?"

I could no more tell you than I could say how
many petals there are in that Dijon rose yonder.

D 2

She gave me an impression of cool soft colour. I
think there was yellow in her hat  pale yellow, like
a primrose."

*men are such dolts about women's dress," retorted
Janet, impatiently ; " and yet they pretend to
have taste and judgment, and to criticize everything
we wear."

I think you may rely upon us for knowing what
we don't like," said Theodore.

He seated himself in his father's easy chair, a roomy
old chair with projecting sides, that almost hid him
from the other occupants of the room. He was weary
and sad, and their chatter irritated his overstrung
nerves. He would have gone straight to his own
room on arriving, but that would have set them
wondering, and he did not want to be wondered about.
He wanted to keep his secret, or as much of it as he
could. No doubt those three knew that he had been
fond of her, very fond ; that he would have sacrificed
half his lifetime to win her for the other half ; but they
did not know how fond. They did not know that he
would fain have melted down all the sands of time
into one grain of gold  one golden day in which
to hold her to his heart and know she loved him.

And warm and light I felt her clasping hand
"mien twined in mine ; she followed where I went"'

There is a touch of childishness in all honeymoon
couples, a something which suggests the Babes in
the Wood, left to play together by the Arch Deceiver,
Fate ; wandering hand in hand in the morning sunshine,
gathering flowers, pleased with the mossy
banks and leafy glades, like those children of the
old familiar story, before ever hunger or cold or fear
came upon them, before the shadow of night and
death stole darkly on their path. Even Godfrey
Carmichael, a sensible, highly-educated young man,
whose pride it was to march in the van of progress
and enlightenment, even he had that touch of
childishness which is adorable in a lover, and which
lasts, oh, so short a time : transient as the bloom
on the peach, the down on the butterfly's wing, the
morning dew on a rose.

He had loved her all his life, as it seemed to him.
They had been companions, friends, lovers, for
longer than either could remember, so gradual had
been the growth of love. Yet the privilege of
belonging to each other was not the less sweet
because of this old familiarity.

*' Are we really married  really husband and wife
Godfrey ? " asked Juanita, nestling to his side as
they stood together in the wide verandah where
they breakfasted on these July mornings among
climbing roses and clematis. " Husband and wife
such prosaic words. I heard you speak of me to
the Vicar yesterday as ' my wife.' It gave me quite
a shock."

*' Were you sorry to think it was true ? "

Sorry  no ! But wife. The word has such a
matter-of-fact sound. It means a person who writes
cheques for the house accounts, revises the bill of
fare, and takes all the blame when the servants do
wrong."

** Shall I call you my idol, then, my goddess  the
enchantress whose magic wand wafts gladness and
sunshine over my existence ?<"

No, call me wife. It is a good word, after all,
Godfrey  a good serviceable word, a word that will
stand wear and tear. It means for ever."

They breakfasted tte--tte in their bower of
roses ; they wandered about the Chase or sat in the
garden all day long. They led an idle desultory
life like little children, and wondered that evening
came so soon, and stayed up late into the
summer night, steeping themselves in the starshine
and silence which seemed new to them in their
mutual delight.

There was a lovely view from that broad terrace,
with its Italian balustrade and statues, its triple
flight of marble steps descending to an Italian
garden, which had been laid out in the Augustan
age of Pope and Addison, when the distinctive
feature of a great man's garden was stateliness.
Here was the lovers' favourite loitering place when
the night grew late, Juanita looking like Juliet in
her loose white silk tea gown, with its Venetian
amplitude of sleeve and its mediaeval gold embroidery.
The fashionable dressmaker who made that gown
had known how to adapt her art to Miss Dalbrook's

beauty. The long straight folds accentuated every
line of the j&nely moulded figure, fuller than the
average girlish figure, suggestive of Juno rather than
Psyche. She was two inches taller than the average
girl, and looked almost as tall as her lover as she
stood beside him in the moonlight, gazing dreamily
at the landscape.

This hushed and solemn hour on the verge of midnight
was their favourite time. Then only were
they really alone, secure in the knowledge that all
the household was sleeping, and that they had their
world verily to themselves, and might be as foolish
as they liked. Once at sight of a shooting star
Juanita flung herself upon her lover's breast and
sobbed aloud. It was some minutes before he could
soothe her.

*' My love, my love, what does it mean?" he
asked, perplexed by her agitation.

I saw the star, and I prayed that we might never
be parted; and then it flashed upon me that we
might, and I could not bear the thought," she sobbed,
clinging to him like a frightened child.

** My dear one, what should part us, except death? "

*'Ah, Godfrey, death is everywhere. How could
a good God make His creatures so fond of each other
and yet part them so cruelly as He does sometimes
? "

** Only to unite them again in another world, Nata.
I feel as if our two lives must go on in an endless
chain, circling among those stars yonder, which could
not have been made to be for ever unpeopled. There
are happy lovers there at this instant, I am convinced
 lovers who have lived before us here, and
have been translated to a higher life yonder ; lovers
who have felt the pangs of parting, the ecstacy of
reunion."

He glanced vaguely towards that starry heaven,
while he fondly smoothed the dark hair upon Juauita's
brow. It was not easy to win her back to cheerfulness.
That vision of possible grief had too completely
possessed her. Godfrey was fain to be
serious, finding her spirits so shaken ; so they talked
together gravely of that unknown hereafter which
philosophy or religion may map out with mathematical
distinctness, but which remains to the individual
soul for ever mysterious and awful.

Her husband found it wiser to talk of solemn
things, finding her so sad, and she took comfort from
that serious conversation.

"Let us lead good lives, dear, and hope for the
best in other worlds," he said. " There is sound
sense in the Buddhist theory, that we are the makers
of our own spiritual destiny, and that a man may be
in advance of his fellow men, even in getting to
Heaven."

Those grave thoughts had little place in Juanita's
mind next day, which was the first day the lovers
devoted to practical things. They started directly
after breakfast for a tete-astute drive to Milbrook
Priory, where certain alterations and improvements
were contemplated in the rooms which were to be
Juanita's. Godfrey's widowed mother, Lady Jane
Carmichael, had transferred herself and her belongings
to a villa at Swanage, where she was devoting
herself to the creation of a garden, which was on a
small scale to repeat the beauties of her flat old-fashioned
flower garden at the Priory. It irked her
somewhat to think how long the hedges of yew and
holly would take to grow ; but there was a certain

pleasure in creation. She was a mild, loving creature,
with an aristocratic profile, silvery grey hair,
and a small fragile figure ; a woman who looked a
patrician to her finger tips, and whom everybody
imposed upon. Her blue blood had not endowed
her with the power to rule. She adored her son,
was very fond of Juanita, and resigned her place in
her old home without a sigh.

The Priory was a great deal too big for me,"
she told her particular friends. " I used to feel very
dreary there when Godfrey was at Oxford, and afterwards,
for of course he was often away. It was only
in the shooting season that the house looked cheerful.
I hope they will soon have a family, and then
that will enliven the place a little."

Milbrook Village and Milbrook Priory lay twelve
miles nearer Dorchester than Cheriton Chase.
Juanita enjoyed the long drive in the fresh morning
air through a region of marsh and watery meadow,
where the cattle gave charm and variety to a landscape
which would have been barren and monotonous
without them, a place of winding streams on which
the summer sunlight was shining:.

The Priory was by no means so fine a place as
Cheriton, but it was old, and not without interest,
and Lady Jane was justified in the assertion that it
was too large for her. It would be too small perhaps
for Sir Godfrey and his wife in the days to come,
when in the natural course of events James Dalbrook
would be at rest after his life labour, and Cheriton
would belong to Juanita.

No doubt they will like Cheriton better than the
Priory when we are all dead and gone," said Lady
Jane, with her plaintive air. " I only hope they will
have a family. Big houses are so dismal without
little people."

This idea of a family was almost a craze with
Lady Jane Carmichael. She had idolized her only
son, had been miserable at every parting, and it had
seemed a hard thing to her that there was not more
of him, as she had herself expressed it.

** Godfrey has been the dearest boy. I only wish
I had six of him," she would say piteously; and
now her mind projected itself into the future, and
she pictured a bevy of grandchildren  numerous asa
covey of partridges in the upland fields of the home

farm at Cberiton  and fancied herself lavishing her
hoarded treasures of love upon them. She had
grandchildren already, and to spare, the offspring
of her two daughters, but these did not bear the
honoured name of Carmichael, and, though they
were very dear to her maternal heart, they were not
what Godfrey's children would be to her.

She would be gone, she told herself, before they
would be old enough to forsake her. She would begone
before those young birds grew too strong upon
the wing. A blessed spell of golden years lay before
her ; a nursery, and then a schoolroom ; and then
perhaps before the last dim closing scene a bridal, a
granddaughter clinging to her in the sweet sadness
of leave-taking, a fair young face crowned with
orange flowers pressed against her own in the bride's
happy kiss  and then she would say Nunc dimittis,
and feel that her cup of gladness had been filled to
the brim.

The lovers' talk was all of that shadowy future, as
the pair of greys bowled gaily along the level road.
The horses were Godfrey's favourite pair, and belonged
to a team of chestnuts and greys which had

won him some distinction last season in Hyde Park,
when the coaches met at the corner bj the Magazine,
and when the handsome Miss Dalbrook, Lord Cheriton's
heiress, was the cynosure of many eyes. The
thoughts of Sir Godfrey and his wife were far from
Hyde Park and the Four-in-hand Club this morning.
Their minds were filled with simple rural anticipations,
and had almost a patriarchal turn, as of an
Arcadian pair whose wealth was all in flocks and
herds, and green pastures like these by which they
were driving.

The Priory stood on low ground between Wareham
and Swinburne, sheltered from the north by a bold
ridge of heath, screened on the east by a little wood
of oaks and chestnuts, Spanish chestnuts, with
graceful drooping branches, whose glossy leaves
contrasted with the closer foliage of the rugged old
oaks. The house was built of Purbeck stone, and
its bluish grey was touched with shades of gold and
silvery green where the lichens and mosses crept
over it, while one long southern wall was clothed
with trumpet-ash and magnolia, myrtle and rose, as
with a closely interwoven curtain of greenery, from

which the small latticed windows flashed back the
sunshine.

Nothing at the Priory was so stately as its counterpart
at Cheriton. There were marble balustrades
and rural gods there on the terrace ; here there was
only a broad gravel walk along the southern front,
with a little old shabby stone temple at each end.
At Cheriton three flights of marble steps led from
the terrace to the Italian garden, and then again
three more] flights led to a garden on a lower
level, and so by studied gradations to the bottom
of the slope on which the mansion was built.
Here house and garden were on the same leve], and
those gardens which Lady Jane had so cherished
were distinguished only by an elegant simplicity.
Between the garden and a park of less than fifty
acres there was only a sunk fence, and the sole
glory of that modest domain lay in a herd of choice
Channel Island cows, which had been Lady Jane's
pride. She had resigned them to Juanita without a
sigh, although each particular beast had been to her
as a friend.

My dear, what could I do with cows in a villa ? '*

she said, when Juanita suggested that she should at
least keep her favourites, Beauty, and Maydew, and
Coquette. " Of course, as you say, I could rent a
couple of paddocks ; but I should not like to seethe
herd divided. Besides, you will want them all
by-and-by, when you have a family."

Nita stepped lightly across the threshold of her
future home. The old grey porch was embedded in
roses and trailing passion flowers. Everything had
a shabby, old-world look compared with Cheriton.
Here there had been no improvement for over a century
; all things had been quiescent as in the Palace
of the Sleeping Beauty.

"What a dear old house it is, Godfrey, and how
everything in it speaks to me of your ancestors 
your own ancestors  not other people's ! That
makes all the difference. At Cheriton I feel always
as if I were surrounded by malevolent ghosts. I
can't see them, but I know they are there. Those
poor Strangways, how they must hate me."

"If there are any living Strangways knocking
about the world houseless, or at any rate landless,
I don't suppose they feel over kindly disposed to

you," said Godfrey ; *' but the ghosts have done
with human habitations. It can matter very Httle
to them who lives in the rooms where they were
once happy or miserable, as the case may be.
Has your father ever heard anything of the old
family ? "

Never. He says there are no Strangways left
on this hemisphere. There may be a remnant of
the race in Australia," he says, *' for he heard of
a cousin of Reginald Strangway's who went out to
Brisbane years ago to work with a sheep farmer on
the Darling Downs. There is no one else of the old
race and the old name that he can tell me about.
I take a morbid interest in the subject, you know.
If I were to meet a very evil-looking tramp in the
woods and he were to threaten me, I should suspect
him of being a Strangway. They all must
hate us."

** With a very unreasonable hatred, then, Nita, for
it was no fault of jour father's that the family went
to the bad. I have heard my father talk of the
Strangways many a time over his wine. They had
been a reckless, improvident race for ever so many

VOL. I. E

generations, men who lived only for the pleasure of
the hour, whose motto was * Carpe diem ' in the
worst sense of the words. There was a Strangway
who was the fashion for a short time during the
Regency, wore a hat of his own invention, and got
himself entangled with a popular actress, who sued
him for breach of promise. He dipped the property.
There was a racing Strangway who kept a stable at
Newmarket, and married  well  never mind how.
He dipped the property. There was Georgians
Strangway, an heiress and a famous beauty, in the
Sailor King's reign. Two of the Royal Dukes
wanted to marry her; but she ran away with a
bandmaster in the Blues. She used to ride in Hyde
Park at nine o'clock every morning in a green cloth
spencer trimmed with sable, at a time when very
few women rode in London. She saw the bandmaster,
fell over head and ears in love with him, and
bolted. They were married at Gretna. He spent
,as much of her fortune as he could get at, and was
reported to have thrashed her before they parted.
She set up a boarding-house at Ostend, gambled,
drank cheap brandy, and died at five-and-forty."

What a dreadful ghost she would be to meet,"
said Nita, with a shudder.

From first to last they have been a bad lot,"
concluded Sir Godfrey, " and the Isle of Purbeck
was a prodigious gainer when your father became
master of Cheriton Chase and Baron Cheriton of
Cheriton."

That is what they must feel worst of all," said
Nita, speaking of the dead and the living as if they
were one gi-soup of banished shades. " It must be
hard for them to think that a stranger takes his title
from the land that was once theirs, from the house
in which they were born. Poor ill-behaved things,
I can't help being sorry for them."

My fanciful Nita, they do not deserve your pity.
They made their own lives, love. They have only
suffered the result of their own Karma."

*' I only hope they will be better off in their next
incarnations, and that they won't get to that dreadful
eighth world which leads nowhere," said Juanita.

She made this light allusion to a creed which she
and her lover had discussed seriously many a time
in their graver moods. They had read Mr. Sinner's

E 2

iiNi\/i:R<;iTv OF fOsanQ

books together, and had given themselves up in
sometime to the fascinating theories of Esoteric
Buddhism, and had been impressed by the curious
parallel between that semi-fabulous Reformer of the
East and the Teacher and Redeemer in whom
they both believed.

They went about the house together, Nita admiring
everything, as if she were seeing those old
rooms for the first time. The alterations to be made
were of the smallest. Nita would allow scarcely any
change.

*' Whatever was nice enough for Lady Jane must
be good enough for me," she said, decisively, when
Godfrey proposed improvements which would have
changed the character of his mother's morning
room ; a conservatory, and a large bay window
opposite the fire-place, for instance.

But it is such a shabby old hole, compared with
your room at Cheriton."

It is a dear old hole, sir, and I won't have it
altered in the smallest detail. I adore those deep-set
windows and wide window-seats ; and this apple-blossom
chintz is simply delicious. Faded, sir?

What of that? One can't buy such patterns nowadays,
for love or money. And that old Chinese
screen must have belonged to a mandarin of the
highest rank. My only feeling will be that I am a
wretch in appropriating dear Lady Jane's surroundings.
This room fitted her like a glove."

She is charmed to surrender it to you, love ;
and your forbearance in the matter of improvement
will delight her."

*' Your improvements would have been destruction.
A conservatory opening out of that window
would suggest a city man's drawing-room at Pulse
Hill. I have seen such in my childhood when
mother used to visit odd people on the Surrey side
of the river."

Loveliest insolence ! "

** Oh, I am obliged to cultivate insolence. It is
a parvenue's only defensive weapon. We new-made
people always give ourselves more airs than
you who were born in the purple."

She roamed from room to room, expatiating upon
everything with a childlike pleasure, delighted at
the idea of this her new kingdom, over which she

was to reign with undivided sovereignty. Cheriton
was ever so much grander ; but at Cheriton she
had only been the daughter of the house ; indulged
in every fancy, yet in sometime in a state of subjection.
Here she was to be sole mistress, with
Godfrey for her obedient slave.

"And now show me your rooms, sir," she exclaimed,
with pretty authority. "I may wish to
make some improvements there."

You shall work your will with them, dearest,
as you have done with their master."

He led her to his study and general den, a fine
old room looking into the stable-card, capacious,
but gloomy.

"This is dreadful," she cried, "no view, and
ever so far from me ! You must have the room
next the morning-room, so that we can run in to
each other, and talk at any moment."

That is one of the best bedrooms."

What of that ! We can do without superfluous
bedrooms ; but I cannot do without you. This
room of yours will make a visitor's bedroom. If he
or she doesn't like it, he or she can go away, and

leave us to ourselves, which ice shall like ever so
much better, shan't we ? " she asked, caressingly,
as if life were going to be one long honeymoon.


Of course he assented, kissed the red frank lips,
and assured her that for him bliss meant a perpetual
tete-astute. Yes, his study should be next
her boudoir ; so that even in his busiest hours he
should be able to turn to her for gladness  refreshing
himself with her smiles after a troublesome
interview with his bailiff  taking counsel with her
about every change in his stable, sharing her
interest in every new book.

"I will give orders about the change at once,"
he said, " so that everything may be ready for us
when you are tired of Cheriton."

They lunched gaily in the garden. Nita hated
eating indoors when the weather was good enough
for an al fresco meal. They lunched under a
Spanish chestnut that made a tent of foliage on
the lawn in front of the house. They lingered over
the meal, full of talk, finding a new world of conversation
suggested by their surroundings ; and

then the greys were brought round to the hall door,
and they started on the return journey.

It began to rain before they reached Cheriton,
and the afternoon clouded over with a look of premature
winter. No sauntering on the terrace this
evening ; no midnight meanderings among the
cypresses and yews, the gleaming statues and
dense green walls ; as if they had been Romeo
and Juliet, wedded and happy, in the garden at
Verona. For the first time since the beginning of
their honeymoon they were obliged to stay indoors.


*'Itis positively chilly," exclaimed Juanita, asher
maid carried off her damp mantle.

*' My dearest love, I'm afraid you've caught cold,"
said Godfrey, with apprehension.

Do I ever catch cold, Godfrey ? " she cried,
scornfully; and indeed her splendid physique seemed
to negative the idea as she stood before him, tall
and buoyant, with the carnation of health upon
cheek and lips, her eyes sparkling, her head erect.

Well, no, my Juno, I believe you are as free
from all such weakness as human nature can be ;

but I shall order fires all the same, and I implore
you to put on a warm gown."

"I will," she answered, gaily. " You shall seeme
in my copper plush."

** Thanks, love. That is a vision to live for."

** Shall we have tea in my dressing-room  or in
yours ? "

In mine. I think we have taken tea in almost
every other room in the house, as well as in every
corner of the garden."

It had been one of her girlish caprices to devise
new places for their afternoon tea. Whether it had
been as keen a delight to the footmen to carry
Japanese tables and bamboo chairs from pillar to
post was open to question ; but Juanita loved to
colonize, as she called it.

** I feel that wherever we establish our teapot we
invest the spot with the sanctity of home," she
said.

Fires were ordered, and tea in Sir Godfrey's
dressing-room.

It was Lord Dalbrook's dressing-room actually,
and altogether a sacred chamber. It had been one

of the best bedrooms in the days of the Strangways ;
but his Lordship liked space, and had chosen this
room for his den  a fine old room, with full length
portraits of the Sir Joshua period let into the panelling.
The furniture was of the plainest, and very
different from the luxurious appointments of the
other rooms, for these very chairs and tables, and
yonder substantial mahogany desk, had done duty
in James Dalbrook's chambers in the Temple thirty
years before. So had the heavy-looking clock on
the chimney-piece, surmounted by a bronze Saturn
leaning upon his scythe. So had the brass candlesticks,
and the ink stained red morocco blotter on
the desk. He had fallen asleep in that capacious
arm-chair many a time in the small hours, after
struggling with the intricacies of a railway bill or
poring over a volume of precedents.

The thick Persian carpet, the velvet window-curtains,
panelled walls, and fine old fireplace gave
a look of subdued splendour to the room, in spite
of the dark and heavy furniture. There was a large
vase of roses on the desk, where Lord Cheriton
never tolerated a flower ; and there were more roses

on the cLimrieT-piece ; and some smart bamboo
chairs, many coloured, like Joseph's coat, had been
brought from Kite's morning room  and so, with
logs blazing on the floated iron dogs, and a scarlet
tea-table set out with blue and gold china, and a
Moorish copper kettle swinging over a lamp, the
room had as gay an aspect as any one could desire.

Juanita had made her toilet by the time the tea-table
was ready, and came in from her room next
door, a radiant figure in a gleaming copper-coloured
gown, flowing loose from throat to foot, and with no
adornment except a broad collar and cuff's of old
Venice point. Her brilliant complexion and
southern eyes and ebon hair triumphed over the
vivid hue of the gown, and it was at her Sir Godfrey
looked as she came beaming towards him, and not
at the dressmaker's master-piece.

How do you like it ? " she asked, with childlike
pleasure in her fine raiment. " I ought to have
kept it till October, but I couldn't resist putting it
on, just to see what you think of it. I hope you
won't say it's gaudy."

My dearest, you might be clad in a russet cloud

for anything I should know to the contrary. A
quarter of a century hence, when you are beginning
to fancy yourself passee we will talk about gowns.
It will be of some consequence then how you dress.
It can be none now."

That is just a man's ignorance, Godfrey," she
said, shaking her finger at him, as she seated herself
in one of the bamboo chairs, a dazzling figure
in the light of the blazing logs, which danced about
her eyes and hair and copper-coloured gown in a
bewildering manner. *' You think me handsome,
I suppose ? "

Eminently so."

And you think I should be just as handsome if
I dressed anyhow  in a badly-fitting Tussle, for
instance, made last year and cleaned this year, and
with a hat of my own trimming, eh, Godfrey ? "

Every bit as handsome."

** That shows what an ignoramus a University
education can leave a man. My dearest boy, half
my good looks depend upon my dressmaker. Not
for worlds would I have you see me a dowdy, if only
for a quarter of an hour. The disillusion might

last a lifetime. I dress to please you, remember,
sir. It was of sou I thought when I was choosing
my trousseau. I want to be lovely in your eyes
always, always, always."

You need make no effort to attain your wish.
You have put so strong a spell upon my eyes
that with me at least you are independent of the
dressmaker's art."

Again I say you don't know what you are talking
about. But frankly now, do you think this
gown too gaudy? "

*' That coppery background to my Murillo Madonna.
No, love; the colour suits you to perfection."

She poured out the tea, and then sank back in her
comfortable chair, in a reverie, languid after her
explorations at the Priory, full of a dreamlike happiness
as she basked in the glow of the fire, welcome
as a novel indulgence at this time of the year.

'* There is nothing more delightful than a fire in
July," she said.

Her eyes wandered about the room idly.

*' Do 3'ou call them handsome ? " she asked presently.


Godfrey looked puzzled. Was she still harping
on the dress question, or was she challenging his
admiration for those glorious eyes which he had been
watching in their roving for a lazy five minutes.

I mean the Strangways. That is their famous
beauty  the girl in the scanty white satin petticoat,
with the goat. Imagine any one walking about a
wood, with a goat, in white satin. What queer ideas
portrait painters must have had in those days. She
is very lovely though, isn't she ? "

*' She is not my ideal. I don't admire that narrow
Cupids-bow mouth, the lips pinched up as if
they were pronouncing ' prunes and prism,' The
eyes are large and handsome, but too round, the
complexion is wax-foolish. No, she is not my ideal."

I should have been miserable if you had admired
her."

There is a face in the hall which I like ever so
much better, and yet I doubt if it is a good face'*

Which is that ? "

*' The face of the girl in that group of John
Strangway's three children."

"That girl with the toasted hair and bright blue

eyes. Yes, she must have been handsome  but she
looks  I hope you won't be shocked, but I really
can't help saying it  that girl looks a devil."

Poor soul ! Her temper did not do much good
for her. I believe she came to a melancholy end."

How was that ? "

** She eloped from a school in Switzerland with an
officer in a line regiment  a love match ; but she
went wrong a few years afterwards, left her husband,
and died in poverty at Boulogne, I believe."

** Another ghost!" exclaimed Juanita, dolefully.
Poor, lost soul, she must walk. I can't help feeling
sorry for her  married to a man who was unkind
to her, perhaps, and whom she discovered unworthy
of her love. And then years afterwards meeting
some one worthier and better, whom she loved passionately.
That is dreadful ! Oh, Godfrey ! if I
had been married before I saw you  and we had met
and you had cared for me  God knows what kind
of woman I should have been. Perhaps I should
have been one of those poor souls who have a history,
the women mother and her friends stare at and
whisper about in the Park. Why are people so

keenly interested in them, I wonder ? Why can't
they leave them alone ? "

*' It would be charity to do so."

** No one is charitable  in London."

** Do you think people are more indulgent in the
country ? "

I suppose not. I'm afraid English people keep
all their charity for the Continent. I shall never look
at the girl in that group without thinking of her sad
story. She looks hardly fifteen in the picture. Poor
thing ! She did not know what was coming."

They loitered over their tea table, making the most
of their happiness. The sweetness of their dual life
had not begun to pall. It was still new and wonderful
to be together thus, unrestrained by any other
presence.

In the midst of their gay talk Juanita's eyes wandered
to the bronze Time upon the chimney piece,
and the familiar figure suggested gloomy ideas.

** Oh, Godfrey ! look at that grim old man with
his scythe, mowing down our happy moments so
fast that we can hardly taste their sweetness before
they speed away. To think that our lives are hurrying

past us like a rapid river, and that we shall be like
him " (pointing distastefully to the type of old age
the wrinkled brow and flowing beard) ** before we
know that we have lived."

It is a pity, sweet, that life should be so short."

Her glance wandered to the dark oak panel above
the clock, and she started up from her low chair
with a faint scream, stood on tiptoe before the fireplace,
snatched half-a-dozen scraggy peacock's
feathers from the panel, and threw them at her
husband's feet.

"Look at those," she exclaimed, pointing to them
as they lay there.

*' Peacock's feathers ! What have they done that
you should use them so ? "

*' Oh, Godfrey, don't you know?" sLe asked,
earnestly.

*' Don't I know what?"

That peacock's feathers bring ill luck. It is
fatal to take them into a house. They are an evil
omen. And father icill pick them up when he is
strolling about the lawn, and icill bring them indoors
; though I am always scolding him for his

VOL. I. p

obstinate folly, and always throwing the horrid
things away."

"And this kind of thing has been going on for
some years, I suppose ? " asked Godfrey, smiling at
her intensity.

Ever since I can remember."

*' And have the peacock's feathers brought you
misfortune ? "

She looked at him gravely for a few moments, and
then burst into a joyous laugh,

No, no, no, no," she said, '' Fate has been over
kind to me. I have never known sorrow. Fate has
given me you, I am the happiest woman in the world
for there can't be another you, and you are mine. It
is like owning the Kohinoor diamond ; one knows that
one stands alone. Still, all the same, peacock's feathers
are unlucky, and I will not suffer them in your room."

She picked up the offending feathers, twisted them
into a ball, and flung them at the back of the deep
old chimney, behind the smouldering logs ; and then
she produced a chess board, and she and Godfrey
began a game with the board on their knees, and
played for an hour by firelight.

*' A deadly silence step by step increased,
Until it seemed a horrid presence there."

That idea of the Strangways had taken hold of
the bride's fancy. She went into the hall with
Godfrey after dinner, and they looked together at
the family group. The picture was a bishop's half-length,
turned lengthwise, and the figures showed
only the head and shoulders. The girl stood
between the two boys, her left arm round her
younger brother's neck. He was a lad of eleven or
twelve, in an Eton jacket and broad white collar.
The other boy was older than the girl, and was
dressed in dark green corduroy. The heads were
masterly, but the picture was uninteresting.

Did you ever see three faces with so little
fascination among the three?" asked Godfrey;
*' the boys look arrant cubs ; the girl has the
makings of a handsome woman, but the lines of her

F 2

mouth and chin have firmness enough for forty, and
yet she could hardly have been over fifteen when that
picture was painted."

She has a lovely throat and lovely shoulders."

Yes, the painter has made the most of those."

And she has fine eyes."

Fine as to colour and shape, but as cold as a
Toledo blade  and as dangerous. I pity her husband."


That must be a waste of pity. If he had been
good to her she would not have run away from
him."

I am not sure of that. A woman with that
mouth and chin would go her own gate if she
trampled upon bleeding hearts. I wonder your
father keeps these shadows of a vanished race."

He would not part with them for worlds. They
are like the peacock's feathers that he ivill bring
indoors. I sometimes think he has a fancy for
unlucky things. He says that as we have no
ancestors of our own  to speak of  I suppose we
must have ancestors, for everybody must have comedown
from Adam somehow "

** Naturally, or from Adam's ancestor, the
common progenitor of the Darwinian thesis."

*' Don't be horrid. Father's idea is that as we
have no ancestors of our own, we may as well keep
the Strangway portraits. The faces are the history
of the house, father said, when mother wanted
those dismal old pictures taken down to make
way for a collection of modern art. So there
they are, and I can't help thinking that they overlook
us."

They were still standing before the trio of young
faces contemplatively.

"Are they all dead?" asked Juanita, after a
pause.

** God knows. I believe it is a long time since
any of them were heard of. Jasper Blake talks tome
about them sometimes. He was in service here,
you know, before he became my father's bailiff. In
fact, he only left Cheriton after the old squire's
death. He is fond of talking of the forgotten race,
and it is from him that most of my information is
derived. He told me about that unlucky lad,"
pointing to the younger boy. " He was in the navy,

distinguished himself out in China, and was on the
high road to getting a ship when he got broke for
drunkenness  a flagrant case, which all but ended
in a tremendous disaster and the burning of a man-of-war.
He went into the merchant service  did
well for a year or two, and then the old enemy took
hold of him again, and he got broke there. After
that he dropped through  disappeared in the great
dismal swamp where the men who fail in this world
sink out of knowledge."

And the elder boy ; what became of him ? "
"He was in the army  a tremendous swell, I
believe, married Lord Dangerfield's youngest
daughter, and cut a dash for two or three years, and
then disappeared from society, and took his wife to
Corsica, on the ground of delicate health. For anything
I know to the contrary they may still be
living in that free-and-easy little island. He was
fond of sport, and liked a rough life. I fancy that
Ajaccio would suit him better than Purbeck or Pall
Mall."

Poor things ; I wonder if they ever long for
Cheriton?"

** If old Jasper is to be believed, they were passionately
fond of the place, especially that girl.
Jasper was groom in those days, and he taught her
to ride. She was a regular dare devil, according to
his account, with a temper that no one had ever been
able to control. But she seems to have behaved
pretty well to Jasper, and he was attached to her.
Her father couldn't manage her anyhow. They
were too much alike. He sent her to a school at
Lausanne soon after that picture was painted, and
she never came back to Cheriton. She ran away
with an English officer who was home from India
on furlough, and was staying at Duchy for his
health. She represented herself as of full age, and
contrived to get married at Geneva. The squu-e
refused ever to see her or her husband. She ran
away from the husband afterwards, as I told you.
In fact, to quote Jasper, she was an incorrigible
bolter."

*poor, poor thing. It is all too sad," sighed
Juanita. " Let us go into the library and forget
them. There are no Strangways there, thank
Heaven."

She put her arm through Godfrey's and led him
off, unresisting. He was in that stage of devotion
in which he followed her like a dog.

The library was one of the best rooms in the
house, but the least interesting from an archaeologist's
point of view. It had been built early in
the eighteenth century for a ballroom, a long
narrow room, with five tall windows, and it had
been afterwards known as the music room ; but
James Dalbrook had improved it out of its original
character by throwing out a large bay, with three
windows opening on to a semicircular terrace, with
marble balustrade and steps leading down to the
prettiest portion of that Italian garden which was
the crowning glory of Cheriton Manor, and which it
had been Lord Cheriton' s delight to improve. The
spacious bay gave width and dignity to the room,
and it was in the space between the bay and the
fireplace that people naturally grouped themselves.
It was too large a room to be warmed by one fire
of ordinary dimensions, but the fireplace added by
James Dalbrook was of abnormal width and
grandeur, while the chimney-piece was rich in

coloured marbles and massive sculpture. The
room was lined with books from floor to ceiling.
Clusters of wax candles were burning on the mantelpiece,
and two large moderator lamps stood on a
massive carved oak table in the centre of the room
a table spacious enough to hold all the magazines,
reviews, and periodicals in three languages
that were worth reading  Quarterlies, Revue des
Deux Montes Rundschau, Figaro, World, Saturday,
Truth, and the rest of them  as well as guide
books, peerage, clergy and army lists  which
made a formidable range in the middle.

Godfrey flung himself into a long, low, arm-chair,
and Juanita perched herself lightly beside him on
the cushioned arm, looking down at him from that
point of vantage. There was a wood fire here as
well as in the hall ; but the rain was over now, the
evening had grown warmer, and the French windows
in the bay stood open to the dull grey night.

"What are you reading now, Godfrey?" asked
Juanita, glancing 'at the cosy double table in a
corner by the chimney-piece, loaded with books
above and below.

** For duty reading Jones' book on * Grattan and
the Irish Parliament ; ' for old books * Plato ; ' for
new * Wider Horizons.' "

He was an insatiable reader, and even in those
long summer days of honeymoon bliss he had felt
the need of books, which were a habit of his life.

"Is * Wider Horizons ' a good book ? "

"It is full of imagination, and it carries one
away ; but one has the same feeling as in ' Esoteric
Buddhism.' It is a very comforting theory, and it
ought to be true ; but by what authority is this
gospel preached to us, and on what evidence are we
to believe?"

' Wider Horizons ' is about the life to come ? "

"Yes; it gives us a very vivid picture of our
existence in other planets. The author writes as if
he had been there."

"And according to this theory you and I are to
meet and be happy again in some distant star ? "

In many stars  climbing from star to star,
and achieving a higher spirituality, a finer essence,
with every new existence, until we attain the everlasting
perfection."

*' And we who are to die old and worn out here
are to be young and bright again there  in our
next world ? "

Naturally."

And then we shall grow old again  go through
the same slow decay  grey hairs, fading sight,
duller hearing ? "

Yes ; as we blossom so must we fade. The
withered husk of the old life holds the seed from
which the new flower must spring ; and with every
incarnation the flower is to gain in vigour and
beauty, and the life period is to lengthen till it
touches infinity."

'* I must read the book, Godfrey. It may be alla
dream ; but I love even dreams that promise a
future in which you and I shall always be together
as we are now, as we are now."

She repeated those last four words with infinite
tenderness. The beautiful head sank down to
nestle upon his shoulder, and they were silent for
some minutes in a dreamy reverie, gazing into the
fire, where the logs had given out their last flame,
and were slowly fading from red to grey.

It was a quarter to eleven by the dial let into
the marble of the chimney-piece. The butler had
brought a tray with wine and water at ten o'clock,
and had taken the final orders before retiring.
Juanita and her husband were alone amid the
stillness of the sleeping household. The night
was close and dull, not a leaf stirring, and only a
few dim stars in the heavy sky.

As the clock told the third quarter with a small
silvery chime, as if it were a town clock in fairyland,
Juanita started suddenly from her half reclining
position, and listened intently, with her
face towards the open window.

** A footstep ! " she exclaimed. "I heard a
footstep on the terrace."

My dearest, I know your hearing is quicker
than mine ; but this time it is your fancy that heard
and not your ears. I heard nothing. And who
should be walking on the terrace at such an hour,
do you suppose ? "

*' I don't suppose anything about it, but I know
there was some one. I heard the steps, Godfrey.
I heard them as distinctly as I heard you speak just

now ; light footsteps  slow, very slow, and with
that cautious, treacherous sound which light, slow
footsteps always have, if one hears them in the
silence of night."

*' You are very positive."

*' I know it, I heard it ! " she cried, running to
the window, and out into the grey night.

She ran along the whole length of the terrace and
back again, her husband following her with slower
steps, and they found no one, heard nothing from
one end to the other.

"You see, love, there was no one there," said
Godfrey.

I see nothing of the kind  only that the someone
who was there has vanished very cleverly. An
eavesdropper might hide easily enough behind anyone
of those cypresses," she said, pointing to the
obelisk-shaped trees which showed black against
the dim grey of the night.

Why should there be any eavesdropper, love ?
What secrets have you and I that any prowler
should care to watch or listen. The only person of
the prowling kind to be apprehended would be a

burglar ; and as Cheriton has been burglar-free all
these years, I see no reason for fear ; so unless your
mysterious footfall belonged to one of the servants
or a servant's follower, which is highly improbable
on this side of the house, I take it that you must
have heard a ghost."

He had his arm around her, and was leading her
out of the misty night into the warm, bright room,
and his voice had the light sound of laughter ; but
at that word ghost she started and trembled, and
her voice was very serious as she answered, 

A ghost, yes ! It was just like the footfall of a
ghost  so slow, so soft, so mysterious. I believe it
was a ghost, Godfrey  a Strangway ghost. Some
of them must revisit this house'*

*'TMio will dare
To pluck thee from me ? And of thine own will,
Full well I feel that thou would'st not leave me."

The sunshine of a summer morning, streaming
in through mullions windows that looked due south,
raised Juanita's spirits, and dispersed her fears. It
was impossible to feel depressed under such a sky.
She had been wakeful for a considerable part of the
night, brooding upon that ghostly footstep which had
sent such a sudden chill to her warm young heart,
but that broad clear light of morning brought common
sense.

"I daresay it was only some love-sick housemaid,
roaming about after all the others had gone to bed,
in order to have a quiet think about her sweetheart,
and what he said to her last Sunday as they went
home from church. I know how I used to walk about
with no company but my thoughts of you, Godfrey.

and how sweet it used to be to go over all your
dearest words  over and over again  and no doubt
the heart of a housemaid is worked by just the same
machinery that sets mine going  and her thoughts
would follow the same track."

*' That is what we are taught to believe, dearest,
in this enlightened age."

i' Why should it be a ghost ? " pursued Juanita,
leaning back in her bamboo chair, and lazily enjoying
the summer morning, somewhat languid after
a sleepless night.

They were breakfasting at the western end of the
terrace, with an awning over their heads, and a
couple of footmen travelling to and from the house
in attendance upon them, and keeping respectfully
out of earshot between whiles. The table was
heaped with roses, and the waxen chalices of a
great magnolia on the lower level showed above the
marble balustrade, and shed an almost overpowering
perfume on the warm air.

Why should a ghost come now?" she asked,
harping upon her morbid fancies. " There has
never been a hint of a ghost in all the years that

father and mother have lived here. Why should
one come now, unless "

*' Unless what, love?"

Unless one of the Strangways died last night 
at the very moment when we heard the footfall 
died in some distant land, perhaps, and with his
last dying thought revisited the place of his birth.
One has heard of such things."

One has heard of a great many strange
things. The human imagination is very inventive."


Ah, you are a sceptic, I know. I don't think I
actually believe in ghosts  but I am afraid of being
forced to believe in them. Oh, Godfrey, if it were
meant for a warning," she cried, with sudden terror
in the large dark eyes.

What kind of warning ? "

A presage of misfortune  sickness  death. I
have read so many stories of such warnings."

'' My dearest love, you have read too much rubbish
in that line. Your mind is full of morbid
fancies. If the morning were not too warm, I
should say put on your habit and let us go for a

VOL. I. G

long ride. I am afraid this sauntering life of ours
is too depressing for you."

"Depressing  to be with you all day! Ob,
Godfrey, you must be tired of me if you can suggest
such a thing."

*' But, my Nita, when I see you giving yourself
up to gloomy speculations about ghosts and omens."

Oh, that means nothing. When one has a very
precious treasure one must needs be full of fears.
Look at misers ; how nervous they are about their
hidden gold. And my treasure is more to me than
all the gold of Ophir  infinitely precious."

She sprang up from her low chair, and leaned
over the back of his to kiss the broad brow which
was lifted up to meet those clinging lips.

''Oh, my love, my love, I never knew what fear
meant till I knew the fear of parting from you'*
she murmured.

Put on you habit, Nita. We will go for a ride
in spite of the sun. Or what do you say to driving
to Dorchester, and storming your cousins for a
lunch ? I want to talk to Mr. Dalbrook about
Skinner's bill of dilapidation."

Her mood changed in an instant.

** That would be capital fun," she cried. " I
wonder if it is a breach of etiquette to lunch with
one's cousins during one's honeymoon ? "

** A fig for etiquette. Thomas," to an approaching
footman, " order the phaeton for half-past eleven."

** What a happy idea," said Juanita, ** a long,
long drive with you, and then the fun of seeing how
you get on with my strong-minded cousins. They
pretend to despise everything that other girls care
for, don't you know  and go in for literature,
science, politics, everything intellectual, in short 
and I have seen them sit and nurse Darwin or
Buckle for a whole evening, while they have
talked of gowns and bonnets and other girls' flirtations."


Then they are not such Roman maidens as they
affect to be."

** Far from it. They will take the pattern of my
frock with their eyes before I have been in the
room ten minutes. Just watch them."

*' I will ; if I can take my eyes off you."

Juanita ran away to change her white peignoir for

G 2

a walking dress, and reappeared in half an hour
radiant and ready for the drive.

How do you like my frock ? " she asked, posing
herself in front of her husband, and challenging
admiration.

The frock was old gold Indian silk, soft and dull,
made with an exquisite simplicity of long flowing
draperies, over a kilted petticoat which just showed
the neat little tan shoes, and a glimpse of tan silk
stocking. The bodice fitted the tall supple figure
like a glove ; the sleeves were loose and short, tied
carelessly at the elbow with a broad satin ribbon,
and the long suede gloves matched the gown to the
nicest shade. Her hat was Leghorn, broad enough
to shade her eyes from the sun, high enough to add
to her importance, and caught up on one side with a
bunch of dull yellow barley and a few cornflowers,
whose vivid hue was repeated in a cluster of the
same flowers embroidered on one side of the bodice.
Her large sunshade was of the same silk as her gown,
and that was also embroidered with cornflowers, a
stray blossom flung here and there with an accidental
air.

My love, you look as if you had stepped out of
a fashion book."

"I suppose I am too smart," said Juanita with
an impatient sigh ; "and yet my colouring is very
subdued. There is only that touch of blue in the
cornflowers just the one high light in the picture.
That is the only drawback to country life. Everything
really pretty seems too smart for dusty roads
and green lanes. One must be content to grope one's
obscure way in a tailor gown or a cotton frock all the
year round. Now this would be perfection for a
Wednesday in Hyde Park, wouldn't it ? ''

My darling, it is charming. Why should you
not be prettily dressed under this blue summer sky ?
You can sport your tailor gowns in winter. You
are not too smart for me, Sita. You are only too
lovely. Bring your dust cloak, and you may defy
the perils of the road''

Celestina, Lady Carmichael's French-Swiss maid,
was in attendance with the dust cloak, an ample
wrap of creamy silk and lace, cloudlike, indescribable.
This muffled the pretty gown from top to toe, and
Nita took her seat in the phaeton, and prepared fora

longer drive and a longer talk than they had had
yesterday.

She was pleased at the idea of showing off her
handsome young husband and her new frock to those
advanced young ladies, who had affected a kind of
superiority on the ground of what she called " heavy
reading," and what they called advanced views.
Janet and Sophia had accepted Lady Cheriton's
invitations with inward protest, and in their apprehension
of being patronized had been somewhat
inclined to give themselves airs, taking pains to
impress upon their cousin that she was as empty-headed
as she was beautiful, and that they stood
upon an intellectual plane for which she had no
scaling ladder. She had put up with such small
snubbing in the sweetest way, knowing all the time
that as the Honorable Juanita Dalbrook, of Cheriton
Chase, and one of the debutantes whose praises
had been sung in all the society papers, she inhabited
a social plane as far beyond their reach as their
intellectual plane might be above hers.

*'I don't suppose we shall see Theodore," said
Juanita, as the bays bowled merrily along the level
road.

The greys were getting a rest after yesterday's
work, and these were Lady Cheriton's famous
barouche horses, to whom the phaeton seemed a toy.

He must have gone to Heidelberg before now,"
added Juanita.

** He must be fond of Heidelberg to be running
off there when it is so jolly at home."

"He was there for a year, you know, before he
went to Cambridge, and he is always going back
there or to the Harts for his holidays. I sometimes
tell him he is half a German."

She rather hoped that Theodore was in Germany
by this time ; and yet she had assured herself in her
own mind that there could be no pain to him in
their meeting. She knew that he had loved her 
that in one rash hour, after a year's absence in
America, when he had not known, or had chosen to
forget, the state of affairs between her and Godfrey,
he had told her of his love, and had asked her to
give him hope. It was before her engagement ; but
she was not the less frank in confessing her attachment
to Godfrey. "I can never care for anyone
else," she said ; ** I have loved him all my life."

All her life ! Yes, that was Theodore's irreparable
loss. While he, the working man, had been
grinding out his days in the treadmill round of a
country solicitor's office, the young patrician had
been as free as the butterflies in Juanita's rose
garden ; free to woo her all day long, free to share
her most trifling pleasures and sympathize with her
lightest pains. What chance had the junior partner
in Dalbrook & Son against Sir Godfrey Carmichael
of Milbrook Priory ?

Theodore had managed his life so well after that
one bitter rebuff that Juanita had a right to suppose
that his wound had healed, and that the pain of that
hour had been forgotten. She was sincerely attached
to him, as a kinsman, and respected him more than
any other young man of her acquaintance. Had
not Lord Cheriton, that admirable judge of character,
declared that Theodore was one of the cleverest men
he knew, and regretted that he had not attached
himself to the higher branch of the law, as the more
likely in his case to result in wealth and fame ?

The phaeton drove up to the old Hanoverian
doorway as St. Peter's clock chimed the quarter

after one. The old man-servant looked surprised at
this brilliant vision of a beautiful girl, a fine pair of
horses, a smart groom, and Sir Godfrey CarmichaeL
The tout-ensemble was almost bewildering even to a,
man accustomed to see the various conveyances of
neighbouring landowners at his master's door.

Yes, my lady, both the 3'oung ladies are at
home," said Brown, and led the way upstairs with
unshaken dignity.

He had lived in that house five-and-thirty 3-ears,
beginning as shoe-black and errand boy, and he was
proud to hear his master tell his friends how he had
risen from the ranks. He had indulged in some
mild philanderings with pretty parlour-maids in the
days of his youth, but had never seriously entangled
himself, and was a confirmed bachelor, and something
of a misogynist. He was a pattern of honesty
and conscientiousness, having no wife and family to
be maintained upon broken victuals and illuminated
with filched candle-ends or stolen oil. He had nota
single interest outside his master's house, hardly
so much as a thought ; and the glory and honour of
** family " were his honour and glory. So as he

ushered Lady Carmichael and her husband to the
drawing-room he was meditating upon what additions
to the luncheon he could suggest to cook which
might render that meal worthy of such distinguished
guests.

Sophia was seated by one of the windows painting
an orchid in a tall Venetian vase. It was a weakness
with these clever girls to think they could do
everything. They were not content with Darwin
and the new learning, but they painted indifferently
in oils and in water colours, played on various instruments,
sang in three languages, and fancied
themselves invincible at lawn tennis.

The orchid was top-heavy, and had been tumbling
out of the vase every five minutes in a manner that
had been very trying to the artist's temper, and
irritating to Janet, who was grappling with a volume
of Johann Miller, in the original, and losing herself
in a labyrinth of words beginning with ver and
ending with licit.

They both started up from occupations of which
both were tired, and welcomed their visitors with a
show of genuine pleasure ; for although they had

been very determined in their resistance to anything
like patronage on Juanita's part when she
was Miss Dalbrook they were glad that lie should
be prompt to recognize the claims of kindred now
that she was Lady Carmichael.

How good of you to come," exclaimed Janet, *' I
didn't think you would remember us, at such a time."

*' Did you think I must forget old friends because
I am happy ? " said Juanita. " But I mustn't take
credit for other people's virtues. It was Godfrey
who proposed driving over to see you."

I wanted to show you what a nice couple we
make," said Sir Godfrey, gaily, drawing his bride
closer to him, as they stood side by side, tall and
straight, and glowing with youth and gladness, in
the middle of the grave old drawing-room. *' You
young ladies were not so cousinly as your brother
Theodore. Yon didn't drive to Cheriton to welcome
us home."

*' If Theoo had told us what he was going to do we
should have been very glad to be there too," replied
Sophy, *but he rode off in the morning without
saying a word to anybody."

*' He is in Germany by this time, I suppose ? '*
said Juanita.

** He is downstairs in the office. His portmanteau
has been packed for a week, I believe," explained
Janet, " but there is always some fresh business to
prevent his starting. My father relies upon him
more every day''

Dear, good Theodore, he is quite the cleverest
man I know," said Juanita, without the slightest
idea of disparaging her husband, whom she considered
perfection. " I think he must be very much
like what my father was at his age."

*' People who are in a position to know tell us that
he is exactly what his onm father was at that age,"
said Janet, resenting this attempt to trace her
brother's gifts to a more distant source. *' I don't
see why one need go further. My father would not
have been trusted as he has been for the last thirty
years if he were a simpleton ; and Galton observes
"

The door opened at this moment and Theodore
came in.

He greeted his cousin and his cousin's husband
-with unaffected friendliness.

*' It is against my principles to take luncheon,"
he said, laughingly, as he gave Juanita his hand,
*but this is a red-letter day. My father is waiting
for us in the dining-room."

They all went down stairs together, Theodore leading
the way with his cousin, talking gaily as they
went down the wide oak staircase, between sober
panelled walls of darkest brown. The front part of
the ground floor was given up to offices, and the
dining-room was built out at the back, a large bright-looking
room with a bay window, opening on to a
square town garden, a garden of about half an acre,
surrounded with high walls, above which showed the
treetops in one of the leafy walks that skirt the town.
It eras very different to that Italian garden at Cheriton
where the peacocks strutted slowly between long
rows of cypresses, where the Italian statues showed
white in every angle of the dense green wall, and
where the fountain rose and fell with a silvery cadence
in the still summer atmosphere. Here there was
only a square lawn, just big enough for a tennis

court, and a broad border of hardy flowers, with one
especial portion at the end of the garden, where
Sophia experimented in cross fertilisation after the
manner of Darwin, seeming for ever upon the threshold
of valuable discoveries.

Mr. Dalbrook was a fine-looking man of some
unascertained age between fifty and sixty. He
boasted that he was Lord Cheriton's junior by a
year or two, although they had both come to a time
of life when a year or two more or less could matter
very little.

He was very fond of Juanita, and he welcomed her
with especial tenderness in her new character as a
bride. He kissed her, and then held her away from
him for a minute, with a kindly scrutiny.

** Lady Godfrey surpasses Miss Dalbrook," he
said, smiling at the girl's radiant face. *' I suppose
now you are going to be the leading personage in
our part of the county. We quiet townspeople will
be continually hearing of you, and there will not bea
local paper without a notice of your doings. Anyhow
I am glad you don't forget old friends."

He placed her beside him at the large oval table,

on which the handsomest plate and the oldest china
had been set forth with a celerity which testified to
Brown's devotion. Mr. Dalbrook was one of those
sensible people who never waste keep or wages upon
a bad horse or a bad servant, whereby his cook was
one of the best in Dorchester ; so the luncheon,
albeit plain and unpretentious, was a meal of which
no man need feel ashamed.

Juanita was fond of her uncle, as she called this
distant cousin of hers, to distinguish him from the
younger generation, and she was pleased to be sitting
by him, and hearing all the news of the county
town and the county people who were his clients,
and in many cases his friends. It may be that his
cousinship with Lord Cheriton had gone as far as
his professional acumen to elevate him in the esteem
of town and county, and that some people who would
hardly have invited the provincial solicitor for his
own sake, sent their cards as a matter of course to
the law lord's cousin. But there were others who
esteemed Matthew Dalbrook for his own sterling
qualities, and who even liked him better than the
somewhat severe and self-assertive Lord Cheriton.

While Juanita talked confidentially to her kinsman,
and while Sir Godfrey discussed the latest
theory about the sun, and the probable endurance of
our own little planet, with Janet and Sophia, Theodore
sat at the bottom of the table, silent and
thoughtful, watching the lovely animated face with
its look of radiant happiness, and telling himself
that the woman he loved was as far away from him
sitting there, within reach of his touch, within the
sound of his lowest whisper, as if she had been in
another world. He had borne himself bravely on
her wedding-day, and smiled back her happy smile,
and clasped her hand with the steady grip of friendship
; but after that ordeal there had been a sad
relapse in his fortitude, and he had thought of her
ever since as a man thinks of that supreme possession
without which life is worthless  as the miser
thinks of his stolen gold  or the ambitious man of
his blighted name.

Yes, he had loved her with all the strength of his
heart and mind, and he knew that he could never
again love with the same full measure. He was too
wise a n:au, and too experienced in life, to tell himself

that for him time could have no healing power 
that no other woman could ever be dear to him ; hut
he told himself that another love like unto this was
impossible, and that all the future could bring him
would be some pale faint copy of this radiant picture.

I suppose it's only one man in fifty who marries
his first love," he thought, and then he looked at
Godfrey Carmichael and thought that to him overmuch
had been given. He was a fine young fellow,
clever, unassuming, with a frank good face ; a man
who was liked by men as well as by women ; but
what had he done to be worthy of such a wife as
Juanita ? Theodore could only answer the question
in the words of Figaro, *' He had taken the trouble
to be born."

That one thoughtful guest made no difference in
the gaiety of the luncheon table. Matthew Dal-brook
had plenty to say to his beautiful cousin, and
Juanita had all the experiences of the last season to
talk about, while once having started upon Sir
William Thomson and the ultimate exhaustion of
the sun's heat, the sisters were not likely to stop.

VOL. I. H

Poor little life that toddles half an hour,
Crowned with a flower or two, and there an end  "

Sir Godfrey's device for diverting his wife's mind
from the morbid fancies of the previous night
answered admirably. She left Dorchester in high
spirits, after having invited her cousins to Cheriton
for tennis and lunch on the following day, and after
having bade an affectionate good-bye to Theodore,
who was to start on his holiday directly he could
make an end of some important business now in
hand. His father told him laughingly that he
might have gone a week earlier had he really wanted
to go.

** I believe there must be some attraction for you
in Dorchester, though I am not clever enough to find
out what it is," said Mr. Dalbrook, innocently, *for
you have been talking about going away for the last
fortnight, and yet you don't go."

Lady Carmichael had lingered in the homely old
house till afternoon tea, had lingered over her tea,
telling her cousins all they wanted to know about
smart society in London, that one central spot of
bright white light in the dull, grey mass of a busy,
common-place world, of which she knew so much,
and of which they knew so little. Janet and Sophia
professed to be above caring for these things, except
from a purely philosophical point of view, as they
cared for ants, bees, and wasps ; but they listened
eagerly all the same, with occasional expressions of
wonder that human beings could be so trivial.

** Five hundred pounds spent in flowers at Lady
Drumlock's ball ! " cried Sophy, " and to think that
in a few more million years the sun may be as cold
as the north pole, and what trace will there be then
of all this butterfly world ? "

*' Did the Mountains cut a tremendous dash this
season ? " asked Janet, frivolously curious about their
immediate neighbours, county people who went to
London for the season. '' Of course you know she
had thirty thousand pounds left her by an uncle
quite lately. And she is so utterly without brains

H 2

that I daresay she will spend it all in entertainments'*


Oh, they did entertain a good deal, and they did
their hest, poor things, and people went to them,"
Juanita answered, with a deprecating air ; *' but still
I should hardly like to say that they are in society.
In the first place, she has never succeeded in getting
the Prince at any of her dances ; and in the next
place, her parties have a cloud of provincial dulness
upon them, against which it is in vain to struggle.
He can never forget his constituents and his duty to
his borough, and that kind of thing does not answer
if one wants to give really nice parties. I'm afraid
her legacy won't do her much good, poor soul, unless
she gets some clever person to show her how to
spend it. There is a kind of society instinct, don't
you know, and she is without it. I believe the people
who give good parties are born, not made  like poets
and orators."

Sir Godfrey looked down at her, smiling at
her juvenile arrogance, which, to his mind,
was more bewitching than another woman's
humility.

** We mean to show them the way next year, if
we take a house in town," he said.

"But we are not going to have a house in town,"
answered Juanita, quickly. "Why, Godfrey, you
know I have done with all that kind of frivolity. We
can go to Victoria street in May, and stay with our
people there long enough to see all the pictures and
hear some good music, and just rub shoulders with
the friends we like at half-a-dozen parties, and then
we will go back to our nest at the Priory. Do you
think that I am like Lady Mountain, and want to
waste my life upon the society struggle, when I have
your

It was after five o'clock when they left Dorchester.
It was more than half-past seven when they drew
near Cheriton, and the sun was setting behind the
irregular line of hills towards Studland. They approached
the Manor by one of the most picturesque
lanes in the district, a lane sunk between high banks,
rugged and rocky, and with here and there a massive
trunk of beech or oak jutting out above the roadway,
while the gnarled and twisted roots spread over the
rough, shelving ground, and seemed to hold up the

meadow-land upon the higher level : a dark, secret-looking
lane it must have seemed on a moonless
night, sunk so deeply between those earth walls, and
overshadowed by those gigantic trunks and interlacing
branches ; but in this mellow evening light it was a
place in which to linger. There was a right of way
through Cheriton Chase, and this sunk lane was the
favourite approach. A broad carriage drive crossed
the Chase and park, skirted the great elm avenue that
led to the house, and swept round by a wide semicircle
to the great iron gates which opened on the
high road from Wareham.

The steep gable ends of an old English cottage
rose amidst the trees, on the upper ground just outside
the gate at the end of the lane. It was a
veritable old English cottage, and had been standing
at that corner of the park like meadow for more than
two hundred years, and had known but little change
during those two centuries. It was a good deal
larger than the generality of lodges, and it differed
from other lodges insomuch as it stood outside the
gate instead of inside, and on a higher level than the
road ; but it was a lodge all the same, and the duty

of the person who lived in it was to open the gate of
Cheriton Chase to all comers, provided they came in
such vehicles as were privileged to enjoy the right of
way. There was a line drawn somewhere ; perhaps
at coal waggons or tradesmen's carts ; but for the
generality of vehicles the carriage road across Cheriton
Chase was free.

A rosy-faced girl of about fourteen came tripping
down the stone steps built into the bank as the carriage
approached, and was curtseying at the open
gate in time for Sir Godfrey to drive through without
slackening the pace. He gave her a friendly
nod as he passed.

Does Mrs. Porter never condescend to open the
gate herself? " he asked Juanita.

** Seldom for anyone except my father. I think
she makes a point of doing it for him, though I
believe he would much rather she didn't. You mustn't
sneer at her, Godfrey. She is a very unassuming
person, and very grateful for her comfortable position
here, though she has known better days, poor soul."

*' That is always such a vague expression. What
were the better days like ? "

She is the widow of a captain  in the mercantile
marine, I think it is called  a man who was
almost a gentleman. She was left very poor, and my
father, who knew her husband, gave her the lodge to
take care of, and a tiny pension  not so much as I
spend upon gloves and shoes, I'm afraid ; and she
has lived here contentedly and gratefully for the last
ten years. It must be a sadly dull life, for she is an
intellectual woman, too refined to associate with
upper servants and village tradespeople ; so she has
no one to talk to  literally no one  except when
the Vicar, or any of us call upon her. But that is
not the worst, poor thing," pursued Juanita, dropping
her voice to a subdued and sorrowful tone ;
*' she had a great trouble some years ago. You
remember, don't you, Godfrey ? "

I blush to say that Mrs. Porter's trouble has
escaped my memory."

Oh, you have been so much away ; you would
hardly hear anything about it, perhaps. She had
an only daughter  her only child  a very handsome
girl, whom she had educated most carefully ; and
the girl went wrong, and disappeared. I never heard

the circumstances. I was not supposed to know, but
I know lie vanished suddenly, and that there was a
good deal of fuss with mother and the servants, and
the Vicar; and Mrs. Porter's hair began to whiten
from that time, and people who had not cared much
for her before were so sorry that they grew quite
fond of her."

"It is a common story enough," said Godfrey,
*' what could a handsome girl do  except go wrong
in such a Hfe as that. Did she open the gate
while she was here ? "

Only for my father, I believe. Mrs. Porter has
always contrived to keep a girl in a pinafore, like
that girl you saw just now. All the girls come
from the same family, or have done for the last six
or seven years. As soon as the girl grows out of
pinafores she goes off to some better service, and a
younger sister drops into her place."

*' And her pinafores, I suppose."

Mrs. Porter's girls always do well. She has a
reputation for making a good servant out of the raw
material."

** A clever woman, no doubt ; very clever, to have

secured a lodge-keeper's berth without being obliged
to open the gate ; a woman who knows how to take
care of herself."

'* You ought not to disparage her, Godfrey. The
poor thing has known so much trouble  think of
what it was to lose the daughter she loved  and in
such a way  worse than death."

** I don't know about that. Death means the
end. A loving mother might rather keep the sinner
than lose the saint, and the sinner may wash herself
clean and become a saint  after the order of Mary
Magdalene. If this Mrs. Porter had been really
devoted to her daughter she would have followed her
and brought her back to the fold. She would not
be here, leading a life of genteel idleness in that
picturesque old cottage while the lost sheep is still
astray in the wilderness."

You are very hard upon her, Godfrey."

I am hard upon all shams and pretences. I
have not spoken to Mrs. Porter above half-a-dozen
times in my life  she never opens the gate for me,
you know  but I have a fixed impression that she
is a hypocrite  a harmless hypocrite, perhaps  one

of those women whose chief object in life is to stand
well with the Yicar of her parish."

They were at the hall door by this time, and it
was a quarter to eight.

'let us sit in the drawing-room this evening,
Godfrey," said Juanita, as she ran off to dress for
dinner. '' The library would give me the horrors
after last night."

** My capricious one. You will be tired of the
drawing-room to-morrow. I should not be surprised
if you ordered me to sit on the housetop.
We might rig up a tent for afternoon tea between
two chimney stacks."

Juanita made a rapid toilet, and appeared in one
of her graceful cream white tea gowns, veiled in a
cloud of softest lace, just as the clocks were striking
eight. She was all gaiety to-night, just as she had
been all morbid apprehension last night ; and when
they went to the drawing-room after dinner  together,
for it was not to be supposed that Sir Godfrey
would linger over a solitary glass of claret  she
flew to the grand piano and began to play Tito
Mattei's famous waltz, which seemed the most consummate

expression of joyousness possible to her.
The brilliant music filled the atmosphere with
gaiety, while the face of the player, turned to her
husband as she played, harmonized with the lighthearted
melody.

The drawing-room was as frivolously pretty as the
library was soberly grand. It was Lady Cheriton's
taste which had ruled here, and the room was a
kind of record of her ladyship's travels. She had
bought pretty things, or curious things wherever
they took her fancy, and had brought them home to
her Cheriton drawing-room. Thus the walls were
hung with Algerian embroideries on damask or
satin, and decorated with Rhodian pottery. The
furniture was a mixture of old French and old
Italian. The Dresden tea services and ivory statuettes,
and capo di monte vases, and Copenhagen
figures, had been picked up all over the Continent,
without any regard to their combined effect; but
there were so many things that the ultimate result
was delightful, the room being spacious enough to
hold everything without the slightest appearance of
over-crowding.

The piano stood in a central position, and was
draped with a Japanese robe of state  a mass of
rainbow-hued embroidery on a ground of violet satin
almost covered with gold thread. It was the most
gorgeous fabric Godfrey Carmichael had ever seen,
and it made the piano a spot of vivid parti-coloured
light, amidst the more subdued colouring of the
room  the silvery silken curtains, the delicate
Indian muslin draperies, and the dull tawny plush
coverings of sofas and chairs.

The room was lighted only by clusters of wax
candles, and a reading lamp on a small table near
one of the windows. It was a rule that wherever
Sir Godfrey spent his evening there must always bea
reading table and lamp ready for him.

He showed no eagerness for his books yet awhile,
but seemed completely happy lolling at full length
on a sofa near the piano listening and watching as
Juanita played. She played more of Matter's
brilliant music  another waltz  an arrangement of
Non e ver  and then dashed into one of Chopin's
wildest mazurkas, with an audacious self-abandonment
that was almost genius.

Godfrey listened rapturously, delighted with the
music for its own sake, but even more delighted for
the gladness which it expressed.

She stopped at last, breathless, after Mendelssohn's
Capriccio. Godfrey had risen from the sofa
and was standing by her side.

I'm afraid I must have tired you to death," she
said, " but I had a strange sort of feeling that I
must go on playing. That music was a safety valve
for my high spirits."

My darling, I am so glad to see that you have
done with imaginary woes. We may have real
troubles of some kind to face by-and-by, perhaps,
as we go down the hill, so it would be very foolish
to abandon ourselves to fancied sorrows while weare
on the top."

Real troubles  yes  sickness, anxiety, the fear
of parting," said Juanita, in a troubled voice.
Oh, Godfrey, if we were to give half our fortune
to the poor  if we were to make some great sacrifice
 do you think God would spare us such pangs
as these  the fear  the horrible fear of being
parted from each other?"

My dearest, we cannot make a bargain with
Providence. We can only do our duty, and hope
for the best."

At any rate, let us be very  very good to the
poor," urged Juanita, with intense earnestness,
let us have their prayers to plead for us."

The night was warm and still, and the windows
were all open to the terrace. Godfrey and Juanita
took their coffee in their favourite corner by the
magnolia tree, and sat there for a long time in the
soft light of the stars, talking the old sweet talk of
their future life.

We must drive to Swanage and see Lady Jane
tomorrow," said Juanita by-and-by. *' Don't you
think it was very wrong to go to see my people  only
cousins after all  before we went to your mother? "

She will come to us, dear, directly we give her
permission. I know she is dying to see you in your
new character."

*' How lovely she looked at the wedding, in her
pale grey gown and bonnet. I love her almost as
well as I love my own dear, good, indulgent mother,
and I think she is the most perfect lady I ever met."

I don't think you'll find her very much like the
typical mother-in-law, at any rate," replied Godfrey,
gaily.

They decided on driving to Swanage next morning.
They would go in the landau, and bring " the
mother " back with them for a day or two, if she
could be persuaded to come.

Juanita stifled a yawn presently, and seemed
somewhat languid after her sleepless night and long
day of talk and vivacity.

"I am getting very stupid company," she said.
** I'll go to bed early to-night, Godfrey, and leave
you an hour's quiet with 'Wider Horizons.' I
know you are longing to go on with that book, but
your chatter-box wife won't let you."

Of course he protested that her society was worth
more than all the books in the British Museum. He
offered to take his book up to her room and read her
to sleep, if she liked ; but she would not have it so.

** You shall have your own quiet corner and your
books, just as if you were still a bachelor," she said,
caressingly, as she hung upon his shoulder for a
good-night kiss. *ras for me, I am utterly tired

out. Janet and Sophy talked me to death ; and
then there was the long drive home. I shall be as
fresh as ever tomorrow morning, and ready to be
off to dear Lady Jane."

He went into the hall with her, and to the top of
the stairs for the privilege of carrying her candlestick,
and he only left her at the end of the corridor
out of which her room opened.

She did not ring for her maid, preferring solitude
to that young person's attendance. She did not
want to be worried with elaborate hair-brushing or
ceremonies of any kind. She was thoroughly exhausted
with the alternations of emotion of which
her life had been made up of late, and she fell asleep
almost as soon as her head touched her pillow.

The bedroom was over the drawing-room. Her
last look from the open casement had shown her the
reflection of the lights below on the terrace. She
was near enough to have spoken out of the window
to her husband, had she been so minded. She could
picture him sitting at the table at the corner window,
in his thoughtful attitude, his head bent over his
book, one knee drawn up nearly to his chin, one

VOL. I. I

arm hanging loosely across the arm of his low easy
chair. She had watched him thus many a time,
completely absorbed in his book.

She slept as tranquilly as an infant, and her
dream-wanderings were all in pleasant places ; with
him ; always with him ; confused after the manner
of all dreams, but with no sign of trouble.

What was this dream about being with him at
Woolwich where they were firing a big gun ? A
curious dream ! She had been there once with her
father to see a gun drawn  but she had never seen
one fired there  and now in her dream she stood ina
crowd of strange faces, fronting the river, and
there was a long grey ironclad on the water  a
turret ship  and there came a flash, and then a puff
of white smoke, and the report of a gun, short and
sharp, not like the roar of a cannon by any means,
and yet her dream showed her the dark sullen gun
on the grey deck, the biggest gun she had ever seen.

She started up from her pillow, cold and trembling.
That report of the gun had seemed so real
and so near, that it had awakened her. She was
wide awake now, and pushed back her loose hair

from her eyes, and felt under her pillow for her
watch, and looked at it in the dim light of the night-lamp
on the table by her bed.

*' A quarter to one."

She had left the drawing-room a few minutes after
ten. It was long for Godfrey to have sat reading
alone ; but he was insatiable when he had a new
book that interested him.

She got up and put on her slippers and dressing-gown,
prepared to take him to task for his late
hours. She was not alarmed by her dream, but the
sound of that sharp report was still in her ears as
she lighted her candle and went down into the silent
house.

She opened the drawing-room door, and looked
across to the spot where she expected to see her
husband sitting. His chair was empty. The lamp
was burning just as she had left it hours ago, burning
with a steady light under the green porcelain
shade, but he was not there.

Puzzled, and with a touch of fear, she went
slowly across the room towards his chair. He had
strayed out on to the terrace perhaps  he had gone

I 2

out for a final smoke. She would steal after him
in her long white gown, and frighten him if she
could.

*' He ought at least to take me for a ghost," she
thought.

She stopped transfixed with a sudden horror. He
was lying on the carpet at her feet in a huddled
heap, just as he had rolled out of his chair. His
head was bent forward between his shoulders, his
face was hidden. She tried to lift his head, hanging
over him, calling to him in passionate entreaty ;
and, behold, her hands and arms were drowned in
blood. His blood splashed her white peignoir. It
was all over her. She seemed to be steeped in it,
as she sat on the floor trying to get a look at his
face  to see if his wound was mortal.

For some moments she had no other thought than
to sit there in her horror, repeating his name in
every accent of terror and of love, beseeching him
to answer her. Then gradually came the conviction
of his unconsciousness, and of the need of help.
He was badly hurt  dangerously hurt  but it might
not be mortal. Help must be got. He must be

cured somehow. She could not believe that he was
to die.

She rushed to the bell and rang again, and again,
and again, hardly taking her finger from the little
ivory knob, listening as the shrill electric peal
vibrated through the silent house. It seemed an
age before there was any response, and then three
servants came hurrying in  the butler, and one of
the footmen, and a scared housemaid. They saw her
standing there, tall and white, dabbled with blood.

** Some one has been trying to murder him," she
cried. " Didn't you hear a gun ? "

No, no one had heard anything till they heard the
bell. The two men lifted Sir Godfrey from the floor
to the sofa, and did all they could do to staunch
that deadly wound in his neck, from which the blood
was still pouring  a bullet wound. Lambert, the
butler, was afraid that the bullet had pierced the
jugular vein.

If there was life still, it was only ebbing life.
Juanita flung herself on the ground beside that
prostrate form and kissed the unconscious lips, and
the cold brow, and those pallid cheeks ; kissed and

cried over him, and repeated again and again that
the wound was not mortal.

"Is anyone going for the doctor?" she cried,
frantically. "Are you all going to stand still and
see him die?"

Lambert assured her that Thomas was gone to
the stable to wake the men, and despatch a
mounted messenger for Mr. Dolby, the family
doctor.

He might have helped us more if he had run
there himself," cried Juanita. " There will be time
lost in waking the men, and saddling a horse. I
could go there faster."

She looked at the door as if she had half resolved
to rush off to the village in her dressing-gown
and slippers. And then she looked again at
that marble face, and again fell upon her knees by
the sofa, and laid her cheek against that bloodless
cheek, and moaned and cried over him ; while the
butler went to get brandy, with but little hope in
his own mind of any useful result.

"What an end to a honeymoon," he said to
himself despondently.

Is not short partie well borne that brings long ease,
And laves the soiile to sleep in quiet grave ?

Sleeps after boyle, port after store seas,
Ease after warre, death after life . . . /'

The morning dawned upon a weeping household.
There was nothing to be done when Mr. Dolby, the
village surgeon, arrived at Cheriton House. He
could only examine the death-wound and express his
opinion as to its character.

 It was certainly not self-inflicted," he told the
servants, as they stood about him in a stony group.

*' Self-inflicted, indeed!" echoed Lambert, "I
should think not. If ever there was a young man
who had cause to set store by his life it was Sir
Godfrey Carmichael. It's murder, Mr. Dolby, rank
murder."

"Yes, I'm afraid it's murder," said Dolby, with
an air which implied that suicide would have been a
bagatelle in comparison.

But who can have done it, and why?" he asked
after a pause.

The servants inclined to the opinion that it was
the act of a poacher. Lord Cheriton had always
been what they called a mark upon poachers. There
was doubtless a vendetta to which the pheasant snaring
fraternity had pledged themselves, and Sir Godfrey
was the victim of that vendetta ; however strange
it might appear that hatred of Lord Cheriton should
find its expression in the murder of Lord Cheriton's
son-in-law.

We must wait for the inquest before we can
know anything," said Dolby, when he had done all
that surgery could do for that cold clay, which was
to compose the lifeless form in its final rest in a
spare bedroom at the end of the corridor, remote
from that bridal chamber where Juanita was lying
motionless in her dumb despair.

The local policeman was on the scene at seven
o'clock, prowling about the house with a countenance
of solemn stolidity, and asking questions which
seemed to have very little direct bearing on the
case, and taking measurements between the spot

where the murdered man had been found, too plainly
marked by the pool of blood which had soaked into
the velvet pile, and imaginary points upon the terrace
outside, with the doctor at his elbow to make
suggestions, and as far as in him lay behaving as a
skilled London detective might have behaved under
the same circumstances, which conduct on his part
did not prevent Mr. Dolby telegraphing to Scotland
Yard as soon as the wires were at his disposal.

He was in the village post-office when the clock
struck eight, and the post-mistress, who had hung
out a flag and decorated her shop front with garlands
on the wedding day, was watching him with an
awe-stricken countenance as he wrote his telegrams.


The first was to Scotland Yard : 

** Sir Godfrey Carmichael murdered late last
night. Send one of your most trustworthy men to
investigate."

The second was to Lord Cheriton, Grand Hotel,
Parame St. Malo, France : 

** Sir Godfrey Carmichael was murdered last
eight, between twelve and one o'clock. Murderer

unknown. Death instantaneous. Pray come immediately."


The third was to Matthew Dalbrook, more briefly
announcing the murder.

He was going to send a fourth message to Lady
Jane Carmichael, began to write her address, then
thought better of it, and tore up the form.

"I'll drive over and tell her," he said to himself.
*' Poor soul, it will break her heart, let her learn it
hove she may. But it would be cruel to telegraph,
all the same."

Every one at Cheriton knew that Lady Jane's
affections were centred upon her only son. She had
daughters, and she was very fond of them. They
were both married, and had married well ; but their
homes lay far off, one in the Midlands, the other in
the North of England, and although in each case
there was a nursery full of grandchildren, neither
the young married women nor the babies had ever
filled Lady Jane's heart as her son had filled it.

And now Mr. Dolby had taken upon himself to go
and tell this gentle widow that the light of her life
was extinguished ; that the son she adored had been

brutally and inexplicably murdered. It was a hard
thing for any man to do ; and Mr. Dolby was a
warm-hearted man, with home ties of his own.

Before Mr. Dolby's gig was half-way to Swanage,
his telegram had been delivered at Dorchester, and
Matthew Dalbrook and his son were starting for
Cheriton with a pair of horses in the solicitor's neat
T cart, which was usually driven with one. Theodore
drove, and father and son sat side by side in a
dreary silence.

What could be said ? The telegram told so little.
They had speculated and wondered about it in brief
broken sentences as they stood in the office fronting
the sunny street, waiting for the carriage. They
had asked each other if this ghastly thing could be ;
if it were not some mad metamorphose of words,
some blunder of a telegraph clerk's, rather than a
horrible reality.

Murdered  a man who had been sitting at their
table, full of life and spirits, in the glow of youth,
and health, and happiness, less than twenty-four
hours ago ! Murdered  a man who had never known
what it was to have an enemy, who had been popular

with all classes ! Had been ! How awful to think
of him as belonging to the past, he who yesterday
looked forward to so radiant a future. And Theodore
Dalbrook had envied him, as even the most
generous of men must needs envy the winner in the
race for love.

Could it be ? Or if it were really true, how could
it be ? What manner of murderer ? What motive
for the murder ? Where had it happened ? On the
highway  in the woody labyrinths of the Chase ?
And upon the mind of Theodore flashed the same
idea which had suggested itself to the servants. It
might be the work of a poacher whom Sir Godfrey
had surprised during a late ramble. Yet a poacher
must be hard bested before he resorts to murder,
and Sir Godfrey  easy tempered and generous  was
hardly the kind of man to take upon himself the
functions of a gamekeeper, and give chase to any
casual depredator. It was useless to wonder or to
argue while the facts of the case were all unrevealed.
It would be time to do that when they were at
Cheriton. So the father and son sat in a dismal
silence, save that now and again the elder man

sighed "Poor Juanita, my poor Juanita; and she
was so happy yesterday."

Theodore winced at the words. Yes, she had
been so happy, and he had despaired because of her
happiness. The cup of gladness which had brimmed
over for her had been to him a fountain of bitterness.
It seemed to him as if he had never realized how
fondly he loved her till he saw her by her husband's
side, an embodiment of life's sunshine, innocently
revealing her felicity in every look and word. It
was so long since he had ceased to hope. He had
even taught himself to think he was resigned to his
fate, that he could live his life without her. But
that delusion ceased yesterday, and he knew that
she was dearer than she had ever been to him now
that she was irrevocably lost. It was human nature,
perhaps, to love her best when love was most hopeless.


They drove along the level road towards Cheriton,
in the dewy freshness of the summer morning, by
meadow and copse, by heath and cornfield, the skylarks
carolling in the hot blue sky, the corncrake
creaking inside the hedge, the chaffinch reiterating

bis monotonous note, the jay screaming in the wood,
all living creatures revelling in the cloudless summer.
It was hard, awful, unsupportable, that he who was
with them yesterday, who had driven along this road
under the westering sun, was now cold clay, a subject
for the coroner, a something to be hidden away in
the family vault, and forgotten as soon as possible ;
for what does consolation mean except persuasion to
forget ?

Never had the way between Dorchester and Cheriton
Chase looked lovelier than in this morning
atmosphere ; never had the cattle grouped themselves
into more delightful pictures amidst those
shallow waters which reflected the sky ; never had
the lights and shadows been fairer upon those level
meadows and yonder broken hills. Theodore Dal-brook
loved every bit of that familiar landscape ; and
even to-day, amidst the horror and wonder of his
distracted thoughts, he had a dim sense of surrounding
beauty, as of something seen in a dream. He
could have hardly told where he was, or what the
season was, or whether it was the morning or the
evening light that was gilding the fields yonder.

The lowered blinds at Cheriton told only too
surely that the ghastly announcement in the telegram
was no clerical error. The face of the footman
who opened the door was pale with distress.
He conducted Mr. Dalbrook and his son to the
library, where the butler appeared almost immediately
to answer the elder man's eager questions.

Not on the highway, not in the woods or the Park,
but in the drawing-room where the butler had seen
him sitting in a lov; arm-chair by the open window,
in the tranquil summer night, absorbed in his book.

He was that wrapped up that I don't believe he
knew I was in the room, sir," said Lambert, *' till I
asked him if there was anything further wanted for
the night, and then he starts, looks up at me with
his pleasant smile, and answers in his quiet friendly
way, * Nothing more, thank you, Lambert. Is it
very late ? ' I told him it was past eleven, and I
asked if I should shut the drawing-room shutters
before I went to bed, but he says * No, I'll see to
that  I like the windows open,' and then he went on
reading, and less than two hours afterwards he was
lying on the ground, in front of the window  dead.'

Have you any suspicion, Lambert, as to the
murderer ? "

"Well, no, sir; not unless it was a poacher oran
escaped lunatic."

*' The lunatic seems rather the more probable
conjecture," said Matthew Dalbrook. " The police
are at work already, I hope."

*well, sir, yes; our local police are doing all
that lies in their power, and I have done what I
could to assist them. Mr. Dolby wired to Scotland
Yard at the same time as he wired to you."

That was wisely done. Have there been no
traces of the murderer discovered ? No indication
of any kind? "

*' Nothing, sir ; but one of the under-housemaids
remembers to have heard footsteps about on the
terrace, after dark, on several occasions within the
last fortnight ; once while Sir Godfrey and our
young lady were at dinner, and two or three times
at a later hour when they were in the drawing-room
or the library."

** Did she see any one ? "

No, sir ; she is rather a dull kind of girl, and

never so much as troubled to find out what the
footsteps meant. Her bedroom is one of the old
attics on the south side of the house, and she was
sitting at work near her open window when she
heard the footsteps  going and coming  slow and
stealthy like  upon the terrace at intervals. She is
sure they were not her ladyship's nor Sir Godfrey's
steps on either occasion. She says she knows their
walk, and she would swear to these footsteps as
altogether different. Slower, more creeping-like, as
she puts it."

'' Has no one been seen lurking about after
dark?"

"No one, sir, as we have heard of; and the
constable questioned all the servants, pretty close, I
can tell you. He hasn't left much for the London
detective to do."

Matthew Dalbrook had been the only questioner
in this interrogatory. Theodore had sunk into a
chair on entering the room, and sat silent, with a
face of marble. He was thinking of the stricken
girl whose life had been desolated by this mysterious
crime. His father had not forgotten her; but he

VOL. I. K

had wanted, first of all, to learn all lie could about
her husband's death.

How does Lady Carmichael bear it? " he asked
presently.

"Very sadly, sir; very sadly. Mrs. Morley and
Celestina are both with her. Mr. Dolby ordered
that she should be kept as quite as possible, not
allowed to leave her room if they could help it, but
it has been very difficult to keep her quiet. Poor
dear young lady ! She wanted to go to him'*

*' Poor girl ! poor girl ! So happy yesterday ! "
said Matthew Dalbrook.

His son sat silent, as if he were made of stone.

Far, very far off, as it were at the end of a long
dark vista, cut sharply across an impenetrable wood
of choking thorns and blinding briars, he saw
Juanita again radiant, again happy, again loving
and beloved, and on the threshold of another life.
The vision dazzled him, almost to blindness. But
could it ever be ? Could that loving heart ever
forget this agony of to-day  ever beat again to a
joyful measure? He wrenched himself from that
selfish reverie ; he felt a wretch for having yielded

up his imagination, even for a moment, to that
alluring vision. He was here to mourn with her,
here to pity her  to sympathize with this unspeakable
grief. Murdered ! Her lover-husband shot to
death by an unknown hand, her honeymoon ended
with one murderous flash  that honeymoon which
had seemed the prelude to a lifetime of love.

I should like to see her," said Mr. Dalbrook.
*' I think it would be a comfort to her to see me,
however agitated she may be. Yill you take my
name to the housekeeper, and ask her opinion '? "

Lambert looked doubtful as to the wisdom of the
course, but was ready to obey all the same.

*' Mr. Dolby said she was to be kept very quiet,
sir  that she wasn't to see anybody."

That would hardly apply to her own people.
Mr. Dolby telegraphed for me."

** Did he, sir ? Then I conclude he would not
object to her ladyship seeing you. I'll send up
your name. Perhaps, while the message is being
taken, you would like to have a look at the spot
where it happened? "

*' Yes. I want to know all that can be known. '

K 2

Lambert had been so busy with the constable all
the morning that he felt himself almost on a level
with Scotland Yard talent, and he took a morbid
interest in that dark stain on the delicate half tints
of the velvet pile, and in such few details as he was
able to expound. He despatched a footman upstairs,
and he led the Dalbrooks to the drawing-room,
where he opened the shutters of that window
through which the assassin must have aimed, and
let a flood of sunshine into the darkened room.

The chair, the table, and lamp stood exactly as
they had stood last night. Lambert took credit
to himself for not having allowed them to be moved
by so much as an inch.

*' Any assistance in my power I shall be only to
happy to give to the London detective," he said.
*' Of course, coming on the scene as a total stranger,
he can't be expected to do much without help."

There was no need to point out that ghastly stain
upon the carpet. The shaft of noonday sunshine
seemed to concentrate its brightness on that grisly
patch. Dark, dark, dark with the witness of a
cruel murder  the murder of a man who had never

done an unkindly act, or harboured an unworthy
thought.

Theodore Dalbrook stood looking at that stain.
It seemed to bring the fatal reality nearer to him.
He looked at the low chair with its covering of peacock
plush, and its Turkish embroidery draped
daintily across the broad back and capacious arms 
a chair to live in  a sybarite's estate  and then at
the satinwood book-table filled with such books as
the lounger loves  Southey's " Doctor," " Burton''
*' Table Talk," by Coleridge, Whatever, Rogers,
*' The Sentimental Journey," "Rochefoucauld,"
** Caxtoniana," "Elia," and thrown carelessly upon
one of the shelves a handkerchief of cobweb cambric,
with a monogram that occupied a third of the fabric,
J.C." Her handkerchief, dropped there last night,
as she arranged the books for her husband's use 
putting her own favourites in his way.

Lambert took up a book and opened it with a dismal
smile, handing it to Mr. Dalbrook as he did so.

It was "Wider Horizons," the volume he had
been reading when the bullet struck him, and those
open pages were spattered with his blood.

"Put it away for God's sake, man," cried Dal-brook,
horrified. '*' Whatever you do don't let Lady
Carmichael see it."

"No, sir, better not, perhaps, sir  but it's
evidence, and it ought to be produced at the
inquest."

Produce it if you like ; but there is evidence
enough to show that he was murdered on this
spot."

"As he sat reading, sir; the book is a great
point."

And then Lambert expounded the position of that
lifeless form, making much of every detail, as he had
done to the constable.

While he was talking, the door was opened
suddenly, and Juanita rushed into the room.

Lord have mercy on us, she mustn't see that,"
cried Lambert, pointing to the carpet.

Matthew Dalbrook hurried forward to meet her,
and caught her in his arms before she could reach
that fatal spot. He held her there, looking at her
with pitying eyes, while Theodore approached slowly,
silently, agonized by the sight of her agony. The

change from the joyous self-abandonment of yesterday
to the rigid horror of to-day was the most
appalling transformation that he had ever looked
upon. Her face was of a livid pallor, her large
dark eyes were distended and fixed, and all their
brilliancy was quenched like a light blown out.
Her blanched lips trembled as she tried to speak,
and it was after several futile efforts to express her
meaning that she finally succeeded in shaping a
sentence distinctly.

** Have they found his murderer ? "

*not yet, dearest. It is far too soon to hope for
that. But it is not for yoa to think about that,
Juanita. All will be done  be sure  rest secure in

the devotion of those who love you; and " with

a break in his voice, ** who loved him."

She lifted her head quickly, with an angry light
in the eyes which had been so dull till that moment.

Do you think I will leave that work to others ?"
she said. " It is my business. It is all that God
has left me to do in this world. It is my business
to see that his murderer suffers  not as I suffer 
that can never be  but all that the law can do 

the law which is so merciful to murderers nowadays.
You don't think he can get off lightly, do
you, uncle ? They will hang him, won't they ?
Hang him  hang him  hang him," she repeated,
in hoarse dull syllables. " A few moments' agony
after a night of terror. So little  so little ! And
I have to live my desolate life. My punishment is
for a lifetime."

**My love, God will be good to you. He can
lighten all burdens," murmured Mr. Dalbrook,
gently.

*' He cannot lighten mine, not by the weight of a
single hair. He has stretched forth His hand
against me in hatred and anger, perhaps because I
loved His creature better than I loved Him."

** My dearest, this is madness "

** I did, I did," she reiterated. " I loved my
husband better than I loved my God. I would
have worshipped Satan if I could have saved him
by Satan's help. I loved him with all my heart,
and mind, and strength, as we are taught to love
God. There was not room in my heart for any
other religion. He was the beginning and the end

of my creed. And God saw my happy love and
hated me for it. He is a jealous God. We are
taught that when we are little children. He is a
jealous God, and He put it into the head of some
distracted creature to come to that window and shoot
my husband."

A violent fit of hysteria followed these wild words.
Matthew Dalbrook felt that all attempts at consolation
must needs be vain for some time to come.
Until this tempest of grief was calmed nothing could
be done.

She will have her mother here in a day or
two," said Theodore. " That may bring some
comfort."

Juanita heard him even in the midst of her
hysterical sobbing. Her hearing was abnormally
keen.

"No one, no one can comfort me, unless they can
give me back my dead."

She started up suddenly from the sofa where Matthew
had placed her, and grasped his arm with convulsive
force.

*' Take me to him," she entreated, '' take me to

him, uncle. You were always kind to me. They
won't let me go to him. It is brutal, it is infamous
of them. I have a right to be there."

*' By-and-by, my dear girl, when you are
calmer."

** I will be calm this instant if you will take me
to him," she said, commanding herself at once,
with a tremendous effort, choking down those rising
sobs, clasping her convulsed throat with constraining
hands, tightening her tremulous lips.

See," she said, "I am quite calm now. I will
not give way again. Take me to him. Let me see
him  that I may be sure my happy life was not alla
dream  a mad-woman's dream  as it seems to
have been now, when I cannot look upon his face."

Mr. Dalbrook looked at his son interrogatively.

Let her see him," said Theodore, gently.
*' We cannot lessen her sorrow. It must have its
way. Better perhaps that she should see him, and
accustom herself to her grief ; better for her brain,
however it may torture her heart."

He saw the risk of a further calamity in his
cousin's state  the fear that her mind would succumb

under the burden of her sorrow. It seemed
to him that there was more danger in thwarting her
natural desire to look upon her beloved dead than in
letting her have her way.

The housekeeper had followed her young mistress
to the drawing-room door, and was waiting there.
She shook her head, and murmured something
about Mr. Dolby's orders, but submitted to the
authority of a kinsman and family solicitor, as
even superior to the faculty.

She led the way silently to that upper chamber
where the murdered man was lying. Matthew
Dalbrook put his cousin's icy hand through his arm
and supported her steps as they slowly followed.
Theodore remained in the drawing-room, walking
up and down, in deepest thought, stopping now and
then in his slow pacing to and fro to contemplate
that stain upon the velvet pile, and the empty chair
beside it.

In the room above Juanita knelt beside the bed
where he who kissed her last night on the threshold
of her chamber lay in his last slumber, a marble
figure with calm dead face shrouded by the snowy

sheet, with flowers  white waxen exotics  scattered
about the bed. She lifted the sheet, and looked
upon him, and kissed him with love's last despairing
kiss, and then she knelt beside the bed, with
her face bent in her clasped hands, calmer than she
had been at any moment since she found her murdered
husband lying at her feet.

"It's wonderful," whispered the housekeeper to
Mr. Dalbrook ; "it seems to have soothed her, poor
dear, to see him  and I was afraid she would have
broke down worse than ever."

You must give way to her a little, Mrs. Morley.
She has a powerful mind, and she must not be
treated like a child. She will live through her
trouble, and rise superior to it, be sure of that ;
terrible as it is."

The door opened softly, and a woman came into
the room, a woman of about five-and-forty, of
middle height, slim and delicately made, with aquiline
nose and fair complexion, and flaxen hair just
touched with grey. She was deadly pale, but her
eyes were tearless, and she came quietly to the bed,
and fell on her knees by Juanita's side and hid her

face as Quaint's was hidden, and the first sound
that came from her lips was a long low moan  a
sound of greater agony than Matthew Dalbrook had
ever heard in his life until that moment.

"Good God," he muttered to himself, as he
moved to a distant window, " I had forgotten Lady
Jane."

It was Lady Jane, the gentle soul who had loved
that poor clay with a love that had grown and
strengthened with every year of his life, with a love
that had won liberal response from the recipient.
There had never been a cloud between them, never
one moment of disagreement or doubt. Each had
been secure in the certainty of the other's affection.
It had been a union such as is not often seen between
mother and son ; and it was ended  ended by
the red hand of murder.

Matthew Dalbrook left the room in silence, beckoning
to the housekeeper to follow him.

"Leave them together," he said. " They will be
more comfort to each other than anyone else in the
world can be to either of them. Keep in the way 
here, in the corridor, in case of anything going

wrong  fainting, or hysterics, for instance  but so
long as they are tolerably calm let them be together,
and undisturbed."

He went back to his son, and they both left the
house soon afterwards and drove off to find the
Coroner and to confer with him. Later in the
afternoon they saw the local policeman, whose discoveries,
though he evidently thought them important,
Mr. Dalbrook considered 7iil.

He had found out that a certain village freebooter
 ostensibly an agricultural labourer, nocturnally
a poacher  bore a grudge against Lord
Cheriton, and had sworn to be even with him
sooner or later. The constable opined that, being
an ignorant man, this person might have mistaken
Lord Cheriton's son-in-law for Lord Cheriton himself.

He had discovered, in the second place, that two
vans of gipsies had encamped just outside the Chase
on the night after the arrival of the bridal pair.
They were, in fact, the very gipsies who had provided
Aunt Sally and the French shooting gallery
for the amusement of the populace, and he opined
that some of these gipsies were " in it."

Why they should be in it he did not take upon
himself to explain, but he declared that his experience
of the tribe justified his suspicions. He was
also of opinion that the murderer had come with the
intent to plunder the drawing-room, which was in
his own expression, "chock-full of valuables." and
that, being disappointed, and furthermore detected,
in that intent, he had tried to make all things safe
by a casual murder.

But, man alive, Sir Godfrey was sitting in his
arm-chair, absorbed in his book. There was nothing
to prevent any intending burglar sneaking away
unseen. You must find some better scent than that
if you mean to track the murderer."

I hope, sir, with my experience of the district, I
shall have a better chance of finding him than a
stranger imported from the Metropolis," said
Constable Barber, severely. " I conclude there will
be a reward offered, Mr. Dalbrook ? ' '

There will, and a large one. I must not take
upon myself to name the figure. Lord Cheriton
will be here tomorrow or next day, and he will, no
doubt, take immediate steps. You may consider

yourself a very lucky man, Barber, if you can solve
this mystery."

Matthew Dalbrook turned from the eager face of
the police-officer with a short, angry sigh. It was
of the reward the man was thinking, no doubt 
congratulating himself perhaps upon the good luck
which had thrown such a murder in his way. And
presently the man from Scotland Yard would be on
the scene, keen and business-like, yet full of a
sportsman's ardour, intent on discovery, as on a
game in which the stakes were worth winning.
Little cared either of these for the one fair life cut
short, for the other young life blighted.

I saw a Fury whetting a death-darts"'

Lord Cheeiton liked to take his summer holiday
on a sunny sea-shore where there \ere not many
English visitors. Parame St. Malo fulfilled both
these conditions. It afi'ordecl him a vast expanse of
golden sands, firm beneath his foot, steeped in sunshine
for the most part, on which to pace to and fro,
lifting his eyes dreamily now and then to the sea-girt
city, with its stony rampart, and its quaint Louis
Quatorze mansions, facing the sea in the sober dignity
of massive stone facade and tall windows ; gi-ey old
houses, which seem too good for the age in which
they find themselves, solid enough to last through
long centuries, and to outlive all that yet lingers of
that grandiose France in which they were built.
Roof above roof rises the Breton city, steep old streets
leading up to Cathedral and Municipal Palace, with

VOL. I. L

the crocketed steeple for its pinnacle, shining with a
pale brilliance in the summer sunlight, measureless,
and with but little colour save the reflected glory of
the skies, and the jasper green of the sea in its ring
of golden sand.

Lord Cheriton affected Parame because though it
was within a summer night's journey from his own
Isle of Purbeck, it was thoroughly out of the beaten
track, and he was tolerably secure from those hourly
encounters with his most particular friends, to which
he must have submitted at Baden or Spa, at Trou-ville
or Dieppe. Parame was Parisian or nothing.
The smart people all came from Paris. English
smartness had its centre at Dinard, and the English
who patronize Dinard will tell you there is no other
paradise on earth, and that its winter climate is
better than that of the Kiviera, if people would only
have faith. So long as the Cheriton s could keep
out of the way of exploring friends from Dinard, his
Lordship was exempt from the amusements which
to some minds make life intolerable.

Lady Cheriton was distinctly social in her
instincts, and looked Dinard-wards sometimes from

her lotus-land with a longing eye. She would have
liked to ask some nice people to luncheon ; and she
knew so many nice people at Dinard. She would
have liked to organize excursions to Mont St. Michel,
or up the Ranee to Dinah. She would have liked to
plunge into all manner of innocent gaieties ; but her
husband stamped out these genial yearnings.

** It seems such a pity not to have people over to
dinner when there are such nice operettas and
vaudevilles every night at the Casino," she sighed.

*' And if you had them over to dinner, how do you
suppose they would get back ? " asked her husband,
sternly. " Would you wish to keep them all till
next morning, and be bored with them at breakfast
? "

That intervening strip of sea, narrow as it was
afforded unspeakable comfort to Lord Cheriton. It
was an excuse for refusing to go over and take afternoon
tea with people he was supposed to hold in his
heart of hearts in the way of friendship.

"You can go, Maria, if you like," he told his
wife; " but I am not a good sailor, and I came hereon
purpose to be quiet."

L 2

This was his Lordship's answer to every hospitable
suggestion. He had come to Parame for rest ;
and not for gadding about, or entertainments of any
kind.

So the long summer days succeeded each other
in a lazy monotony, and whatever gaiety there
might be in the great white hotel, the English law-lord
and his wife had no share in it. They
occupied a suite of light, airy rooms in the west
pavilion, and were served apart from the vulgar
herd, after the fashion which befitted a person of
Lord Cheriton's distinction. They had only their
body servants, man and maid, so they were waited
upon by the servants of the hotel, and they drove
about the dusty, level roads between St. Servant
and Dol in a hired landau, driven by a Breton
coachman. Lady Cheriton was dull, but contented.
She had always submitted to her husband's pleasure.
He had been a very indulgent husband in essentials,
and he had made her a peeress. Her married life
had been eminently satisfactory ; and she could
afford to endure one summer month of monotony
amidst pleasant surroundings. She dropped in at

the Casino every evening, while Lord Cheriton read
the papers in the seclusion of his salon  with the
large French window wide open to the blue sea,
and the blue moonlight  hearing the tramp of feet
on the terrace, or the sea wall beyond, or now and
again strains of lively music from the theatre, where
the little opera company from Paris were singing
Lecocq's joyous music.

People used to turn round to look at Lady Cheriton
as she walked gravely between the rows of seats
to her place near the orchestra, his Lordship's valet
following with an extra shawl, an opera-glass, and a
footstool. He established her in her chair, and
then retired discreetly to the back of the theatre to
await her departure, and to escort her safely back to
the hotel. He was a large, serious looking man, a
French Swiss, who had lived ten years in Italy, andover
fifteen years in Lord Cheriton's service, and
who spoke French, Italian, German, and English
indifferently.

Lady Cheriton was handsome still, with a grand
Spanish beauty which time had touched lightly.
She was tall and dignified in carriage, though a

shade stouter than she could have wished, and she
dressed to perfection with sobriety of colouring and
richness of material. Her life had been full of
pleasantness, her only sorrow being the loss of her
infant sons, which she had not taken to heart so
deeply as the proud father who had pined for an
heir to his newly won honours. She had her
daughter, her first-born, the child for whom her
heart had first throbbed with the strange new
love of maternity. She shed some natural tears
for the boy-babies, and then she let Juanita fill
their place in her heart, and her life again seemed
complete in its sum of happiness. And now in
this sleepy summer holiday  cut off from most
things that she cared for  Juanita's letters had
been her chief joy  those happy, innocent, girlish
letters, overflowing with fond, foolish praise of the
husband she loved, letters made up of nothings  of
what he had said to her, and what she had said to
him  and where they had taken afternoon tea 
and of their morning ride, or their evening walk,
and of those plans for the long future which they
were always making, projecting their thoughts into

the time to come, and laying out those after years
as if they were a certainty.

There had been no fairer morning than that
which followed the night of the murder. Lord
Cheriton was an early riser at all seasons, most of
all in the summer, when he was generally awake
from five o'clock, and had to beguile an hour or so
with one of the books on the table by his bed  a
well-thumbed "Horace " or a duodecimo "Don
Quixote," in ten volumes, which went everywhere
with him. By seven o'clock he was dressed, and
ready to begin the day ; and between that hour and
breakfast it was his habit to attend to the correspondence
which had accumulated during the previous
day. This severe rule was suspended, however,
at Parame, and he gave himself up to restful
vacuity, strolling up and down the sands, or walking
round the walls of St. Malo, or sauntering into the
cathedral in a casual way for an early mass, enjoying
the atmosphere of the place, with its old-world
flavour.

On this particular morning he went no further
than the sands, where he paced slowly to and fro

in front of the long white terrace, hotel, and casino,
heedless alike of Parisian idlers coquetting with
the crisp wavelets on the edge of the sea, and of
the mounted officer yonder drilling his men upon
the sandy flat towards St. Malo. He was in a
mood for idleness, but with him idleness was only
a synonym for deep thought. He was meditating
upon his only child's future, and telling himself
that he had done well for her.

Sir Godfrey Carmichael would be made Baron
Cheriton in the days to come, when he, the first
Baron, should be laid in the newly built vault in
the cemetery outside Dorchester. He was not going
to sever himself from his kindred in that last sleep,
albeit they were common folk. He would lie under
the Egyptian sarcophagus which he had set up in
honour of his father, the crockery dealer, and his
mother, the busy, anxious house-wife. The sarcophagus
was plain and unpretentious, hardly too good
for the shopkeeper ; yet with a certain solid dignity
which was not unbefitting the law-lord, almost as
massive as that mammoth cross which marks the
resting-place of Henry Brougham in the fair southern

land. He had chosen the monument with uttermost
care, so that it might serve the double purpose. He
had looked at the broad blank panel many a time,
wondering how his own name would look upon it,
and whether his daughter would have a laurel wreath
sculptured above it. It might be that admiring
friends would suggest his being laid in the Abbey,
hard by those shabby disused courts where he had
pleaded and sat in judgment through so many
laborious years ; and it might be that the suggestion
would be accepted by Dean and Chapter, and
that the panel on the Dorchester sarcophagus would
remain blank. James Dalbrook knew that he had
deserved well of posterity, and, above all, of the
ruling powers. He had been staunch and unwavering
in his adherence to his own party, and he knew
that he had a strong claim upon any Conservative
Ministry. He had sounded those in authority, and
he had been assured that there would be very little
difficulty in getting Sir Godfrey Carmichael a peerage
by-and-by, when he, Lord Cheriton, should be no
more. Sir Godfrey's family was one of the oldest in
the country, and he had but to deserve well of his

party, when lie had got his seat, to ensure future
favours. As the owner of the Cheriton and Milbrook
estates, he would be a worthy candidate for one of
those coronets which seem to be dealt round so
freely by expiring Ministries, as it were a dying
father dividing his treasures among his weeping
children. So far as any man can think with satisfaction
of the days when he shall be no more  and
when this world will go on, badly, of course, but
somehow, without him  Lord Cheriton thought of
those far off years when Godfrey Carmichael should
be owner of Cheriton Chase. The young man had
shown such fine qualities of heart and mind, and,
above all, had given such unobtrusive evidence of
his affection for Juanita's father, that the elder man
must needs give measure for measure ; therefore
Godfrey had been to Lord Cheriton almost as a son.
The union of his humbly-born daughter with one of
the oldest families in the south of England gratified
the pride of the self-made man. His own pedigree
might be of the lowliest; but his grandson would
be able to look back upon a long line of ancestors,
glorified by many a patrician alliance. Strong and

stern as was the fabric of James Dalbrook's mind,
he was not superior to the Englishman's foible, and
he loved rank and ancient lineage. He was a Tory
to the core of his heart ; and it was the earnestness
and thoroughness of his convictions which had given
him weight with his party. Wherever he spoke, or
whatever he wrote  and he had written much upon
current politics in the Saturday Review, and the
higher class monthlies  bore the stamp of a Cromwellian
vigour and a Cromwellian sincerity.

He had never felt more at ease than upon that
balmy summer morning, pacing those golden sands
in quiet meditation  brooding over Juanita's last
letter received overnight  with its girlish raptures,
its girlish dreams ; picturing her in the near future
as happy a mother as she was a bride, with his
grandson, the third Baron Cheriton of the future, in
her lap. He smiled at his own foolishness in thinking
of that first boy-baby by the title which was but
one of the possibilities of a foreshadowed sequence of
events; yet he found himself repeating the words
idly, to the rhythm of the wavelets that curled and
sparkled near his feet  third Baron Cheriton,

Godfrey Dalbrook Carmichael, third Baron Cheriton.


The cathedral clock was striking nine as he went
into the hotel. The light breakfast of coffee and
rolls was laid on a small round table near the window.
Lady Cheriton was sitting in a recess between the
massive stone columns which supported the balcony
above, reading yesterday's Morning Post in her soft
grey cashmere peignoir, whose flowing lines gave
dignity to her figure. Her dark hair, as yet untouched
by time, was arranged with an elegant
simplicity. The fine old lace about her throat
harmonised admirably with the pale olive of her
complexion. She looked up at her husband with
her placid smile, and gave him her hand in affectionate
greeting.

What a morning, James ! One feels it a privilege
to live. What a superb day it would be for
Mont St. Michel ?''

A thirty mile drive in the dust ! Do you really
think that it is the best use to which to put a summer
day? You may be sure there will be plenty of
worthy people of the same opinion, and that the

rock will swarm with cheap tourists, and pretty
little Madame Pollard will be put to the pin of her
collar to feed them all."

She had seated herself at the table by this time,
and was pouring out coffee with a leisurely air,
smiling at her husband all the time, thinking him
the greatest and wisest of men, even when he restrained
her social instincts. She was never tired of
looking at that massive face, with its clearly defined
features, sharply cut jaw, and large gi-ey eyes  dark
and deep as the eyes of the earnest thinker rather
than the shrewd observer. The strong projection of
the lower brow indicated keen perceptions, and the
power of rapid judgment ; but above the perceptive
organs the upper brow towered majestically, giving
the promise of a mind predominant in the regions
of thought and imagination  such a brow as we look
upon with reverence in the portraits of Walter Scott.

Intellectually the brow was equal to Scott's ;
morally there was something wanting. Neither
benevolence nor veneration was on a par with the
reasoning faculties. Tory principles with Lord
Cheriton were not so much the result of an upward-looking

nature as they were with Scott. This, at
least, is the opinion at which a phrenologist might
have arrived after a careful contemplation of that
powerful brow.

Lord Cheriton sipped his coffee, and leaned back
in his arm-chair, with his face to the morning sea.
He sat in a lazy attitude, still thoughtful, with those
pleasant thoughts which are the repose of the working
man's brain.

The tide was going out ; the rocky islets stood
high out of the water; the sands were widening,
till it seemed almost as if the sea were vanishing
altogether from this beautiful bay.

** I suppose they will finish their honeymoon in a
week or two, and move on to the Priory," said Lord
Cheriton, by-and-by, revealing the subject of his
reverie.

- '* Yes, Juanita says we may go home as early as
the second week in August if we like. She is to beat
the Priory in time to settle down before the
shooting begins. They will have visitors in September
 his sisters, don't you know  the Morning-sides
and the Grenvilless, and children and nurses 

a house full. Lady Jane ought to be there to help
her to entertain."

*' I don't think Nita will want any help. She
will be mistress of the situation, depend upon it,
and would be if there were forty married sisters with
their husbands and belongings. She seemed to be
mistress of us all at Charlton ? "

She is so clever," sighed the mother, remembering
that Cheriton House would no longer be under
that girlish sovereignty.

The grave looking French-Swiss valet appeared
with a telegram on a salver.

Who can have sent me a ji hleue ? " exclaimed
Lord Cheriton, who was accustomed to
receive a good many of those little blue envelopes
when he was in Paris, but expected no such communications
at St. Malo.

Before leaving for his holiday he had impressed
upon laud steward and house steward that he was
not to be bothered about anything.

If there is anything wanted you will communicate
with Messrs. Dalbrook," he said. '* They have
full powers."

And yet here was some worrying message  some
question about a lease or an agreement, or somebody's
rick had been burnt, or somebody's chimney
had fallen through the roof. He opened the little
envelope with a vexed air, resentful of an expected
annoyance. He read the message, and then sat
blankly staring ; read again, and rose from his seat
suddenly with a cry of horror.

Never in his life had he experienced such a
shock; never had those iron nerves, that heart,
burned hard in the furnace of this world's strife,
been so tried. He stood aghast, and could only
give the little paper  with its type-printed syllables
to his scared wife, while he stood gazing at
summer sky and summer sea in a blank helplessness,
realizing dimly that something had happened
which must change the whole course of the future,
and overthrow every plan he had ever made.

The third Baron Cheriton." Strange, but in
that awful moment the words he had repeated idly
on the sands half an hour ago echoed again in his
ear.

Alas, he felt as if that title for which he had

toiled was already extinct. He saw, as in a vision,
the velvet cap and golden coronet upon the
coffin lid, as the first and last Lord Cheriton was
carried to his grave. That prophetic vision must
needs be realized within a few years. There would
be no one to succeed him.

Murdered ! Why ? By whom ? What devil had
been conjured out of hell to cut short that honest,
stainless life? What had Godfrey Carmichael
done that a murderer's hand should be raised
against him ?

Lady Cheriton' s softer nature found relief in tears
before the day was done ; tears and agonized pacing
up and down those rooms where life had been so
placid in the sunlight  agonized supplications that
God would take pity upon her widowed girl.

*' So young, and so happy, and a widow  a
widow before her nineteenth birthday," wailed the
mother.

Lord Cheriton' s grief was of a sterner kind, and
found no outlet in words. He held a brief consultation
with his valet, a soldierly-looking man, who

VOL. I. M

had fought under Garibaldi in Burgundy, when the
guerilla captain made his brilliant endeavour to
save sinking France. They looked at time-tables
and calculated hours. The express to Paris would
not arrive in time for the evening mail via Calais
and Dover. It was Saturday. The cargo boat
would cross to Southampton that night, and influence
would obtain accommodation for his Lordship
and party on board her. The valet took a fly
and drove off to the quay to find the South-Western
superintendent, and secure a private cabin for his
master and mistress. They would have the boat to
themselves, and would be at Southampton at seven
o'clock next morning, and at Cheriton before noon,
even if it were necessary to engage a special engine
to take them there.

Lord Cheriton telegraphed to his daughter.

Your mother and I will be with you tomorrow
morning. Be brave for our sakes. Remember
that you are all we have to live for."

Another telegram to the house-steward ordered a
close carriage to be in attendance at Wareham
Station at ten o'clock on Sunday morning.

"How quietly you bear it, James," bis wife told
Lord Cberiton, wonderingly, when the mode of their
return bad been arranged, and ber maid was packing
ber trunks, with those soberly handsome gowns
wbicb bad been the wonder of many a butterfly
Parisienne.

Sbe called bim by bis Christian name now as in
their earliest years of wedded life. It was only on
ceremonious occasions, and when the eye of society
was upon ber that sbe addressed bim by ibis
title.

That stern quietude of bis, the fine features set
and rigid, frightened ber more than a loquacious
grief would bave done. And yet sbe hardly knew

Poor Godfrey," sbe sighed, ''be was so good tome

My God ! my God ! bow horrible. If it bad been

young, so handsome  cut off in the flower of ibis
days ! And sbe loved bim so. Sbe bas loved him

M 2

all her life. What will become of her without
him ? "

*' What will become of her ? " that was the
mother's moaning cry all through that dreary day.

Lord Cheriton paced the sands as far as he could
go from that giddy multitude in front of the sea
wall  beyond the little rocky ridge by the pleasant
Hotel des Bains, where the young mothers, and
nurses, and children, and homely, easy-going
visitors congregate  away towards Cancale, where
all was loneliness. He walked up and down, meditating
upon his blighted hopes. He knew now that
he had loved this young man almost as well as he
loved his own daughter, and that his death had
-shattered as fair a fabric as ever ambition built on
the further side of the grave.

'* She will go in mourning for him all the days of
my life, perhaps," he thought, " and then some
day after I am in my grave she will fall in love with
an adventurer, and the estate I love and the fortune
I have saved will be squandered on the Turf or
thrown away at Monte Carlo."

A grim smile curled his lip at a grim thought, ashe

paced that lonely shore beyond the jutting cliff
and the Till on the point.

"I am sorry I left the Bench when I did," he
thought, " it would have been something to have
put on the black cap and passed sentence upon that
poor lad's murderer."

Who was his murderer, and what the motive of
the crime ? Those were questions which Lord
Cheriton had been asking himself with maddening
iteration through that intolerable summer day. He
welcomed the fading sunlight of late afternoon. He
could eat nothing ; would not even sit down to
make a pretence of dining ; but waited chafing in
the great stone hall of the hotel for the carriage
that was to take him and his wife to the steamer.

The stars move still, Time runs, the clock will strike."

Trains were favourable, and there was no necessity
for a special engine to carry Lord Cheriton and his
wife to the house of mourning. It was not yet noon
when the closed landau drove in at the chief gate of
the park, not that side gate in the deep, rocky lane,
of which Mrs. Porter was custodian. One oaf the
gardeners lived at the lodge, and it was he who
opened the gate this Sunday morning. Lord Cheriton
stopped the carriage to question him. He had
heard a full account of the murder already from the
station-master at Wareham.

Have they found the murderer ? " he asked.

No, my Lord, I'm afraid they're not likely to 
begging your Lordship's pardon for venturing an
opinion."

The man was an old servant, and altogether a
superior person.

Were the gates locked at the usual time on
Friday night ? "

"Yes, my Lord  the gates were locked, but that
wouldn't keep out a foot-passenger. There's the
turnstile in the lane'*

Of course. Yes, yes. A London detective has
been at work, I hear."

Yes, my Lord ; came yesterday before two
o'clock, and has been about with Barber ever since."

And have they discovered nothing ? "

Nothing, my Lord  or if they have it has been
kept dark."

Lord Cheriton asked no further questions. The
man was right. A detective from Scotland Yard was
not likely to talk about any minor discoveries that
he might have made. Only the one grand discovery
of the guilty man would have been made known.

Five minutes later the carriage drew up in front
of the hall door. What a blank and melancholy
look the fine old house had with all the windows
darkened. It did not look so dismal as a London

Louse with its level rows of windows and its flat
facade would have looked under similar conditions ;
for here there was variety of muUion and moulding,
bay-windows and oriel, dormer and lattice, and overall
the growth of lovely creeping plants, starry
clematis and passion-flower, clustering Banksia
roses and waxen magnolia, an infinite beauty of
form and colour. Yet the blind windows were
there, with their dull, dead look and chilling suggestion
of death. Lady Cheriton looked at the house
for a moment or so as she got out of the carriage,
and then burst into tears. It seemed to her as if
she had scarcely realized the stern reality till that
moment.

She went straight to her daughter's boudoir, a
room with an oriel window looking across the wide
expanse of the park, where the turf lay openest to
the sunshine, and where the deer were wont to congregate.
The garden was at its narrowest point
just below this window, and consisted only of a
broad gravel path, and a strip of flowers at the top
of a steep grass bank that sloped down to the ha-ha
which divided garden and park. The room was full

of Juanita's girlish treasures  evidences of fancies
that had passed like summer clouds  accomplishments
begun and abandoned  a either in one corner
a guitar and a mandolin against the wall  an
easel in front of one window  a gigantic rush work-basket
lined with amber satin and crammed with all
manner of silks, wools, scraps, and unfinished undertakings
in another. The room remained just as she
had left it when she went to London at the beginning
of May. She had not occupied it during her honeymoon
; and perhaps that was the reason she was
here now in her desolation, sitting silent, statue-like,
with Lady Jane by her side, on a sofa opposite the
oriel. She lifted her eyelids when her mother came
into the room, and looked up at her in speechless
despair. She uttered no word of greeting, but sat
dumbly. Lady Cheriton went over to her, and knelt
by her side, and then, feebly, automatically, the
widowed girl put her limp, cold hand into her
mother's and hid her bloodless face upon her
mother's breast.

Lady Cheriton held her there with one hand while
she stretched out her other hand to Lady Jane.

*dear Lady Jane, how good of you to be with
her  to comfort her."

Where else should I be ?  I want to be near
him ! "

The gentle blue eyes filled with tears, the gracious
head trembled a little. Then came a long shivering
sigh and silence.

The mother knelt beside the sofa with her child's
head leaning forward upon her matronly bosom.
There may have been some comfort perhaps in that
contact, some recurrence of the thoughts and feelings
of earlier years, when the mother could console every
grief and soothe every pain. No words came to
either of those mourners. What could be said in
mitigation of a sorrow that seemed to offer no point
of relief, no counter-balancing good. There was
nothing to be done but to sit still and suffer.

The silence lasted long, and then Juanita lifted
her head suddenly from its heavy repose and looked
fixedly in her mother's face.

"My father has come back with you?" she
asked.

** Yes, dearest. We did not lose an hour. Had

there been any quicker way of travelling we would
have been here sooner."

My father will be able to find the murderer,"
said Juanita, scarcely hearing her mother's words,
intent upon her own thought. " A great lawyer ashe
was ; a judge, too ; he must be able to trace the
murderer  to bring him to justice  to take a life fora
life. Oh, God ! " with a shrill agonizing cry,
could a thousand lives give me back one hour of
that one life ? Yet it will be something  something
 to know that his murderer has been killed 
killed shamefully, in cold blood, in the broad light
of day. Oh, God, thou Avenger of wi-long, make
his last hours bitter to him, make his last moments
hopeless, let him see the gates of hell opening before
him when he stands trembling with the rope round
his neck."

There was an intensity of hatred in this vindictive
appeal, which thrilled the two listeners with an
icy horror. It was like a blast from a frozen region
blowing suddenly in their faces, and they shivered
as they heard. Could it be the girl they knew, the
loving, lovable girl, who, in those deep, harsh tones,

called upon her God for vengeance and not for
mercy ?

Oh, my love, my poor heart-broken love, pray
to Him to have pity upon us, ask Him to teach us
how to bow to the rod, how to bear His chastisement.
That is the lesson we have to learn'*
pleaded Lady Jane, tearful and submissive, even in
the depth of sorrow.

Is it ? My lesson is to see justice done upon
the wretch who killed my husband  the malignant,
the merciless devil. There was not one of those
slayers of women and children in the Indian mutiny
worse than the man who killed my love. What had
lie done  he, the kindest and best  generous, frank,
pitiful to all who ever came in his way  what had
he done to provoke any man's enmity? Oh, God,
when I remember how good he was, and how much
brighter and better the world was for having
him "

She began to pace the room, as she had paced it
again and again in her slow hours of agony, her
hands clasped above her dishevelled head, her great
dark eyes so dove-like in their hours of love and

happiness  burning with an angry light, lurid
almost, in the excitement of her fevered brain.
There had been times when Lady Jane had feared
that reason must give way altogether amidst this
wild delirium of grief. She had stayed to watch,
and to console, forgetting her own broken heart,
putting aside all considerations of her own sorrow as
something that might have its way afterwards, in
order to comfort this passionate mourner.

Comfort, even from affection such as this, was unavailing.
Now and again the girl turned her burning
eyes upon the mother's pale, resigned face, and
for a moment a thought of that chastened, gentle
grief softened her.

** Dear, dear Lady Jane, God made you better than
any other woman on this earth, I believe," she cried
amidst her anguish. *' The saints and martyrs must
have been like you, but I am not. I am not made
like that. I cannot kiss the rod."

The meeting between Juanita and her father was
more painful to him than to her. She hung upon
bis neck in feverish excitement, imploring him to
avenge her husband.

"You Can doit," she urged; *you who are so
clever must know how to bring the murderer's guilt
home to him. You will find him, will you not,
father ? He cannot have gone very far. He cannot
have got out of the country yet. Think, it was only
Friday. I was a happy woman upon Friday ; onlj
think of that  happy  sitting by Godfrey's side in
the phaeton, driving through the sunset, and thinking
how beautiful the world was and what a privilege
it was to live. I had no more foreboding than
the skylark had singing above our heads. And in
less than an hour after midnight my darling was
dead. Oh, God, how sudden. I cannot even remember
his last words. He kissed me as he left
me at my bedroom door  kissed me and said something.
I cannot remember what it was ; but I can
hear the sound of his voice still  I shall hear it all
my life."

Lord Cheriton let her ramble on. He had, alas,
so little to say to her, such sorry comfort to offer.
Only words, mere words  which must needs sound
idle and hollow in the ear of grief, frame his consolatory
speeches with what eloquence he might.

He could do nothing for lier, since lie could not give
her back her dead. This wild cry for vengeance
shocked him from those young lips; yet it was
natural perhaps. He too would give much to seethe
assassin suffer ; he too felt that the dock and the
gallows would be too trivial a punishment for that
accursed deed.

He had looked upon the marble face of him who
was to have been the second Baron Cheriton 
looked upon it in its placid repose, and had sworn
within himself to do all that ingenuity could do to
avenge that cruel murder.

*' He could not have had an enemy," he told himself,
*' unless it was some wretch who hated him for
being happy and beloved."

He had a long talk with Mr. Luke Churton, the
London detective, who had exhausted all his means
without arriving at any satisfactory result.

I confess, my Lord, that I am altogether at a
standstill," said Mr. Churton, when he had related
all that he had done since his arrival on the scene
early on Saturday afternoon. " The utmost information
I have been able to obtain leaves me without

one definite idea. There is no one in the neighbourhood
open to suspicion, so far as I can make
out ; for I am sure your lordship will agree with me
that your butler's notion of a poacher resenting your
treatment by the murder of your son-in-law is much
too thin. One cannot accept such a notion as that
for a moment," said Mr. Churton, shaking his
head.

"No, that is an untenable idea, no doubt."
The next suggestion is that some person was
prowling about with the intention of abstracting
trinkets and other valuables from the drawing-room
in an unguarded moment when the room might
happen to be empty  and I admit that the present
fashion of covering drawing-room tables and cabinets
with valuables of every description is calculated to
suggest plunder'; but that kind of thing would be probable
enough in London rather than in the country,
and nothing is more unlikely than that a prowler of
that order would resort to murder. Again, the
manner in which the body was found, with the open
book lying close to the hand that had held it, goes for
to prove that Sir Godfrey was shot as he sat reading

and at a time when a burglar could have no
motive for shooting him."

Do you think it was the act of a lunatic ? "

No, my Lord, for in that event the murderer
would have been heard of or found before now. The
gardens, park, and chase have been most thoroughly
searched under my superintendence. It is not
possible for a lap-dog to be hidden anywhere within
this demesne. The neighbouring villages  solitary
cottages  commons and copses  have been also
submitted to a searching investigation  the police
all over the country are on the alert. Of course the
crime is still of very recent date. Time to us
seems longer than it really is."

No doubt, no doubt ! I can find no other hypothesis
than that the act was done by a madman 
such a motiveless murder  a man sitting by a
window reading  shot by an unknown hand from a
garden terrace  remote from the outer world. Were
we in Ireland the crime might seem commonplace
enough. Sir Godfrey was a landowner 
and that alone is an offence against the idle and
the lawless in that unhappy country  but here,

VOL. I. N

in the midst of an orderly, God-fearing population
"

** Had Sir Godfrey no enemy, do you think, my
Lord?" asked the detective, gravely. " The crime
has the look of a vendetta."

*' There never was a young man, owner of a
considerable estate, more universally beloved. His
tenants adore him  for as a landlord he has been
exceptionally indulgent."

He may have granted too much in some quarters,
and too little in others."

No, no. He has been judicious in his liberality,
and he has a capital bailiff, an old man who was a
servant on this estate many years ago."

But there are other influences," said the detective,
musingly. "Whenever I meet with a crime of
this kind  motiveless apparently  I remember the
Eastern Prince  I think he was one of those long-headed
Orientals, wasn't he, my Lord, who used to
ask ' Who is she ? ' In a thoroughly dark case I
always suspect a woman behind the curtain. Sir
Godfrey had been independent of all control for a
good many years  and a young man of fortune,

handsome, open-hearted, with only a mother to look
after him  well, my Lord, you know the kind of
thing that generally happens in such cases."

*' You mean that my son-in-law may have been
involved in some disreputable intrigue? "

I don't say disreputable, my Lord ; but I venture
to suggest that there may have been some  ahem 
some awkward entanglement  with a married woman,
for instance  and the husband  or another lover 
may have belonged to the criminal classes. There
are men who think very little of murder when they
fancy themselves ill-used by a woman. Half the
midnight brawls, and nearly half the murders, in the
metropolis are caused by jealousy. I know what a
large factor that is in the sum-total of crime, and
unless you are sure there was no entanglement "

I am as sure as I can be of anything outside
my own existence. I don't believe that Sir Godfrey
ever cared for any woman in his life except my
daughter."

"He might not have cared, my Lord, but he
might have been drawn in," suggested Mr.
Churton. 'young men are apt to be weak where

N 2

women are concerned ; and women know that,
unfortunately, and they don't scruple to use their
power ; not the best of 'em even."

Young men are apt to be weak. Yes, Lord
Cheriton had seen enough of the world to know
that this was true. It was just possible that in
that young life, which had seemed white as snow to
the eye of kindred and friends, there had been one
dark secret, one corroding stain, temptation yielded
to, promises given  never to be fulfilled. Such
things have been in many lives, in most lives,
perhaps, could we know all. Lord Cheriton thought,
as he sat silently meditating upon the detective's
suggestions.

Lady Jane might know something about her
son's past, perhaps, something that she might have
kept locked in the beneficent maternal heart. He
determined to sound her delicately at the earliest
opportunity.

But on being sounded Lady Jane repudiated any
such possibility. No, again and again no. His
youth had been spotless ; no hint of an intrigue
had ever reached her from any quarter. He had

chosen his friends among the most honourable
young men at the University  his amusements had
been such as became a young Englishman of
exalted position  he had never stooped to low
associations or even doubtful company ; and from
his boyhood upwards he had adored Juanita.

"That love alone would have kept him right,"
said Lady Jane ; " but I do not believe that it was
in his nature to go wrong."

It would seem, therefore, that the detective's
suspicion was groundless. Jealousy could not have
been the motive of the crime.

"If any of us could be sure that we know each
other I ought to accept Lady Jane's estimate of her
son," thought Lord Cheriton ; "but there is always
the possibility of an unrevealed nature  one phase
in a character that has escaped discovery. I am
almost inclined to think the detective may have hit
upon the truth. There must have been a motive for
this devilish act  unless it were done by a maniac."

The latter supposition seemed hardly probable.
Lunacy wandering loose about the country would
have betrayed itself before now.

It was past five upon that summer afternoon, and
Lord Cheriton, having seen his daughter and interviewed
the detective, was sauntering idly about the
gardens in the blank hours before dinner. That
meal would be served as usual, no doubt, at eight
o'clock, with all due state and ceremony. The
cook and her maids were busied about its preparation
even now in this tranquil hour when afternoon
melts into evening, sliding so softly from day tonight
that only those evening hymns of the birds 
and on Sundays those melancholy church bells
thrilling across the woods  mark the transition.
They were scraping vegetables and whipping eggs
while the birds were at vespers, and they were
talking of the murder as they went about their
work. When would they ever cease to gloat with
ghoulish gusto on that deadly theme, with endless
iteration of " says he " and *' says she " ?

Lord Cheriton left the stately garden with its
quadruple lines of cypress and juniper, its marble
balustrades, and clipped yew hedges five feet thick,
its statues and alcoves. He passed through a little
gate, and across a classic single-arched bridge to

the park, where he sauntered slowly beneath his
immemorial elms, in a strange dream-like frame of
mind, in which he allowed his senses to be beguiled
by the balmy afternoon atmosphere and the golden
light, until the all-pervading consciousness of a
great grief, which had been with him all day,
slipped off him for the moment, leaving only a
feeling of luxurious repose, rest after labour.

Cheriton Chase was exercising its wonted influence
upon him. He loved the place with that deep
love which is often felt by the hereditary owner, the
man born on the soil, but perhaps still oftener, and
to a greater degree by him who has conquered and
won the land by his own hard labour of head or
hand, by that despicable personage, the self-made
man. In all his wanderings  those luxurious
reposeful journeyings of the man who has conquered
fortune  James Dalbrook's heart yearned towards
these ancient avenues and yonder grey walls.
House and domain had all the charm of antiquity,
and yet they were in a measure his own creation.
Everywhere had his hand improved and beautified ;
and he might say with Augustus that where he

found brick he would leave marble. The dense
green walls  those open-air courts and quadrangles
those obelisks of cypress and juniper had been therein
the dominion of the Strangways, with here and
there a mouldering stone Syrinx or a moss. grown
Pan ; but it was he who brought choicest marbles
from Rome and Florence to adorn that stately
pleasaunce ; it was he who had erected yonder
fountain, whose waters made a monotonous music
by day and night. The marble balustrades, the
mosaic floors, the artistic enrichment of terrace and
mansion had been his work. If the farms were
perfect it was he who had made them so. If his
tenants were contented it was because he had
shown himself a model landlord  considerate and
liberal, but severely exacting, satisfied with nothing
less than perfection.

Having thus in a manner created his estate
James Dalbrook loved it, as a proud, self-contained
man is apt to love the work of his own hands, and
now in this quiet Sunday afternoon the very atmosphere
of the place soothed him, as if by a spell.
A kind of sensuous contentment stole into his

heart, with temporary forgetfulness of his daughter's
ruined life. But this did not last long. As he
drew near the drive by which strangers were
allowed to cross the park by immemorial right,
he remembered that he had questioned one of
the lodge-keepers, but not the other. He struck
across an open glade where only old hawthorn
trees cast their rugged shadows on the close-cropped
turf, and made for the gate opening into
the lane.

Mrs. Poi-ter's cottage had its usual aspect, a
cottage such as any gentleman or lady of refined
taste might have been pleased to inhabit, quaint,
mediaeval, with heavy timbers across rough cast
walls, deep set casements, picturesque dormers, and
thatched roof, with gable ends which were a source
of rapture to every artist who visited Cheriton  a
cottage embowered in loveliest creeping plants,
odorous of jasmine and woodbine, and set in a
garden where the standard roses and carnations were
rumoured to excel those in her ladyship's own particular
flower-garden. Well might a lady who had
known better days rejoice in such a haven ; more

especially when those better days appeared to have
raised her no higher than the status of a merchant-captain's
wife.

Very few people about Cheriton envied her ladyship.
It was considered that, if not born in the
purple, she had at least brought her husband a large
fortune, and had a right to taste the sweets of
wealth. But there were many hard-driven wives
and shabby genteel spinsters who envied Mrs.
Porter her sinecure at the gate of Cheriton Park,
and who looked grudgingly at the garden brimming
over with flowers and the lattices shining in the
evening sun, and through the open casements at
prettily furnished rooms, rich in books and photographs,
and other trivial indications of a refined
taste.

"It is well to be she," said the curate's wife, as
she went home from the village with two mutton
chops in her little fancy basket, a basket which suggested
ferns, and in which she always carried a
trowel, to give the look of casual botany to her
housewifely errands. " I wonder whether Lord
Cheriton allows her an income for doing nothing.

or is it only house, and coals, and candles that she
gets ? " speculated the curate's wife, who lived in a
hand new villa on the outskirts of Cheriton village,
a villa that was shabby and dilapidated after three
years' occupation, through whose thin walls all the
winds of winter blew, and whose slate roof made the
upper floor like a bakehouse under the summer
sun.

Lord Cheriton, still sauntering in gloomy meditation,
came to the cottage garden outside his gates,
and found Mrs. Porter standing among her roses, a
tall, black figure, the very pink and pattern of respectability,
with her prayer-book in one hand and
a grey silk sunshade in the other. She turned at
the sound of those august footsteps, and came to
the little garden gate to greet her benefactor, with a
grave countenance, as befitted the circumstances.

Good afternoon," he said briefly. ** Have you
just come from church ? "

*' Yes, I have been to the children's service."

** Not very interesting, I should imagine, for anybody
past childhood ? "

"It is something to do on a Sunday afternoon,

,and I like to hear Mr. Kempster talk to the
children."

** Do you ? Well, there is no accounting for
tastes. Can you tell me anything about my son-in-law's
murderer ? Have you seen any suspicious
characters hanging about ? Did you notice any one
going into the park on Friday night ? "

No, I have not seen a mortal out of the common
way. The gate was locked at the usual hour. Of
course the gate would make no difference  it would
be easy for any one to get into the park."

And no one was seen about ? It is extraordinary.
Have you any idea, Mrs. Porter, any
theory about this horrible calamity that has come
upon us ? "

'* How should I have any theory ? I am not
skilled in finding out such mysteries, like the man
who came from London yesterday. Has he made
no discoveries ? "

"Not one."

Then you can't expect me to throw a light upon
the subject."

** You have an advantage over the London detective.

You know the neighbourhood  and you know
what kind of man Sir Godfrey was."

Yes, I know that. How handsome he was,
how frank and pleasant looking, and how your
daughter adored him. They were a beautiful
couple."

Her wan cheeks flushed, and her eyes kindled as
she spoke, as if with a genuine enthusiasm.

They were, and they adored each other. It will
break my daughter's heart. You have known trouble
about a daughter. I think 3-ou can understand
what I feel for my girl."

I do  I do ! Yes, I know what you must feel 
what she must feel in her desolation, with all she
valued gone from her for ever. But she has not to
drink the cup that my girl must drink, Lord
Cheriton. She has not fallen. She is not a thing
for men to trample under foot, and women to shrink
away from."

Forgive me," said Lord Cheriton, in a softened
voice. ** I ought not to have spoken of  Mercy."

You ought never to speak of her  to me. I
suppose you thought the wound was so old that it

might be touched with impunity, but you were
wrong. That wound will never heal."

I am sure you know that I have always been
deeply sorry for you  for that great affliction," said
Lord Cheriton gently,

Sorry, yes, I suppose you were sorry. You
would have been sorry if a footman had knocked
down one of your Sevres vases and smashed it.
One is sorry for anything that can't be replaced."

That is a harsh and unjust way of speaking,
Mrs. Porter," said Lord Cheriton, drawing himself
up suddenly with an air of wounded dignity. " You
can tell me nothing about our trouble, I see ; and I
am not in the mood to talk of any older grief.
Good night."

He lifted his hat with grave respect and walked
back to the park gate, vanishing slowly from those
grey eyes which followed him in eager watchfulness.


** Is he really sorry ? " she asked herself. " Can
such a man as that be sorry for anyone, even his
own flesh and blood ? He has prospered ; all
things have gone well with him. Can he be sorry ?

It is a check, perhaps ; a check to his ambitious
hopes. It baulks him in his longing to found a
family. He looks pale and worn, as if he had
suffered : and at his age, after a prosperous life, it
must be hard to suffer."

So mused the woman who had seen better days 
embittered doubtless by her own decadence  embittered
still more by her daughter's fall.

It was nearly ten years since the daughter had
eloped with a middle-aged Colonel in a cavalry
regiment, a visitor at the Chase  a man of fortune
and high family, with about as diabolical a reputation
as a man could enjoy and yet hold Her
Majesty's commission.

Mercy Porter's fall had been a surprise to everybody.
She was a girl of shy and reserved manners,
graver and sadder than youth should be. She had
been kept very close by her mother, allowed to make
no friendships among the girls in the village, to
have no companions of her own age. She had early
shown a considerable talent for music, and her piano
bad been her chief pleasure and occupation. Lady
Cheriton had taken a good deal of notice of her

when she grew up, and she might have done well,
the gossips said, when they recalled the story of her
disgrace ; but she chose to fall in love with a
married man of infamous character, a notorious profligate,
and he had. but to beckon with his finger for
her to go off with him. The circumstances of her
going off were discussed confidentially at feminine
tea-drinkings, and it was wondered that Mrs. Porter
could hold her head so high, and show herself at
church three times on a Sunday, and entertain the
curate and his wife to afternoon tea, considering
what had happened.

The curate and his wife were new arrivals comparatively,
and only knew that dismal common story
from hearsay. They were both impressed by Mrs.
Porter's regular attendance at the church services,
and by the excellence of that cup of tea with which
she was always ready to entertain them whenever
they cared to drop in at her cottage between four
and five o'clock.

The inquest was opened early on the afternoon of
Monday at the humble little inn near the forge.

with its rustic sign, " Live and let live."
Juanita gave her evidence with a stony calmness
which impressed those who heard her more than the
stormiest outburst of grief would have done. Her
mother and her husband's mother had both implored
her not to break down, to bear herself heroically
through this terrible ordeal, and they were
both in the room to support her by their presence.
Both were surprised at the firmness of
her manner, the clear tones of her voice as she
made her statement, telling how she had heard
the shot in her dream, and how she had gone
down to the drawing-room to find Sir Godfrey
lying face downward on the carpet, in front of
the chair where he had been sitting, his hand
still upon the open book, which had fallen as he
fell.

Did you think of going outside to see if anyone
was lurking about ? "

"No, I thought of nothing but trying to save
him. I did not believe that he was dead."

There was a look of agony in her large wide open
eyes as she said this  a piteous remembrance of

VOL I. o

the moment while she still hoped  which thrilled
the spectators.

*what course did you take?"

*'I rang for the servants. They came after a
time that seemed long  but I believe they came
quickly."

And after they had come ? "

"I remembered nothing more. They wanted
me to believe that he was dead  and I would not
I could not believe  and  I remember no more
till next day."

*' That will do, Lady Carmichael. I will not
trouble you further."

Lady Jane and Lady Cheriton wanted to take
her away after this, but she insisted upon remaining.


I wish to hear every word," she said.

They submitted, and the three women, robed
in densest black, sat in a little group behind the
Coroner till the end of that day's inquiry.

No new facts were elicited from any of the witnesses,
and nothing had resulted from the elaborate
search made not only throughout Lord Cheriton's

domain, but in the neighbourhood. No
suspicious prowlers had been heard of. The gipsies
who had contributed to the gaiety of the wedding
day had been ascertained to have left the Isle
of Purbeck a fortnight before the murder, and to be
delighting the larger world between Portsmouth
and Havant. Nothing had been discovered; no
sale of revolver or gun to any questionable purchaser
at Dorchester ; no indication however slight
which might put a keen-witted detective upon the
trail. Mr. Churton confessed himself completely at
fault.

The jury drove to Cheriton House to view the
body, and the inquest was adjourned for a fortnight,
in the expectation that some discovery might be
made in the interim. The funeral would take place
at the usual time ; there was nothing now to hinder
the victim being laid in his last resting-place in the
old Saxon church at Milbrook.

Bills offering a reward of 500 for any information
leading to the discovery of the murderer were
all over the village, and in every village and town
within a radius of forty miles. The stimulus of

o 2

cupidity was not wanting to sharpen the rural wit.
Mr. Churton shook his head despondently when he
talked over the inquest with Lord Cheriton later in
the day, and owned himself " out of it."

'* I have been in many dark cases, my Lord," he
said, " and I've had many hard nuts to crack, but
this beats 'em all. I can't see my way to making
anything of it ; and unless you can furnish me with
any particulars of the poor young gentleman's past
life, of an enlightening character, I don't see much
hope of getting ahead."

"You stick to your idea of the murder being an
act of revenge ? "

"What other reason could there be for such a
murder ? "

That question seemed unanswerable, and Lord
Cheriton let it pass. Matthew Dalbrook and his
elder son were to dine with him that evening, in
order to talk quietly and calmly over the terrible
event of last week, and the bearing which it must
have upon his daughter's future life. Lady Cheriton
and Lady Jane Carmichael had lived entirely on the
upper floor, taking such poor apologies for meals as

they could be induced to take in her ladyship's
morning-room. That closed door at the eastern end
of the corridor exercised its solemn influence upon
the whole house. Those mourning women never
went in or out without looking that way  and again
and again through the long still days they visited
that chamber of death, carrying fairest blooms of
stephanotis or camellia, whitest rose-buds, waxen
lilies ; kneeling in silent prayer beside that white
bed.

During all those dismal days before the funeral
Juanita lived secluded in her own room, only leaving
it to go to that silent room where the white bed and
the white flowers made an atmosphere of cold purity,
which chilled her heart as if she too were dead.
She counted the hours which remained before even
this melancholy link between life and death would
be broken, and when she must stretch out her hands
blindly to find one whom the earth would hide from
her for evermore. In the brief snatches of troubled
sleep that had visited her since Friday night she
had awakened with her husband's name upon her
lips, with outstretched hands that yearned for the

touch of his, awakening slowly to consciousness
of the horrible reality. In every dream that she
had dreamed he had been with her, and in some of
those dreams had appeared with a distinctness
which involved the memory of her sorrow. Yes,
she had thought him dead  yes, she had seen him
stretched bleeding at her feet ; but that had been
dream and delusion. Reality was here, here in his
strong voice, here in the warm grasp of his hand,
here in the lying vision that was kinder than truth.

Mr. Dalbrook and his son arrived at a quarter to
eight, and were received by Lord Cheriton in the
library. The drawing-room was now a locked
chamber, and it would be long doubtless before anyone
would have the courage to occupy that room.
The Dalbrooks were to stay at Cheriton till after the
funeral. Matthew Dalbrook had been Sir Godfrey's
solicitor, and it would be his duty to read the
will.

He was also one of the trustees to Juanita's marriage
settlement, and the time had come  all too
soon  when the terms of that settlement would
have to be discussed.

How is my cousin ? " asked Theodore, when he
had shaken hands with Lord Cheriton.

Have you seen her since  Friday? "

"Yes, I saw her on Saturday morning. She was
terribly changed."

"A ghastly change, is it not?" said Lord
Cheriton, with a sigh. " I doubt if there is any
improvement since then ; but she behaved splendidly
at the inquest this afternoon. "We were all
prepared for her breaking down. God knows
whether she will ever get the better of her grief,
or whether she will go down to the grave a brokenhearted
woman. Oh ! Matt," turning to his kinsman
and contemporary, " such a trial as this teaches
us how Providence can laugh at our best laid plans.
I thought I had made my daughter's happiness as
secure as the foundations of this old house."

You did your best, James. No man can do
more."

Theodore was silent for the most part after his
inquiry about his cousin. He listened while the
elder men talked, and gave his opinion when it was
asked for, and showed himself a clear-headed man

of business ; but his depression was not the less
evident. The thought of Juanita's grief  the contrast
between her agony now and her joyousness the
day she was at Dorchester  was never absent from
his mind; and the talk of the two elder men, the
discussion as to the extent of her possessions, her
power to do this and that, the house she was to live
in, the establishment she was to keep, jarred upon
him horribly.

By the conditions of the settlement, the Priory
is to be hers for her life, with everything it contains.
By the conditions of Sir Godfrey's will, in the event
of his leaving no issue, the Priory estate is to go
after his widow's death to Mrs. Grenville's eldest
son, or failing a son in that direction, then to Mrs.
Morningside's eldest son. Should neither sister
leave a son surviving at the time of Lady Carmichael's
death the estate is to be sold, and the
product divided in equal portions among the surviving
nieces ; but at the present rate at which the
two ladies are filling their nurseries there is very
little doubt there will be a surviving son. Mrs.
Grenville was Sir Godfrey's favourite, I know, and

I can understand his giving her boy the estate, and
thus founding a family, rather than dividing the
property between the issue of the two sisters."

** I do not think anybody can find fault with his
will," said Lord Cheriton. " God knows that when
I saw him sign it in my room in Victoria Street, an
hour after his marriage, nothing was further from
my thoughts than the idea that the will would come
into force within the nest fifty years. It seemed
almost an idle precaution for so young a man to be
in such a hurry to set his house in order."

*' Do you think Juanita will decide to live at the
Priory ? " asked Mr. Dalbrook.

It would seem more natural for her to live herewith
her mother and me, but I fear that this house
will seem for ever accursed to her. She will remember
that it was her own whim to spend her
honeymoon here. It will seem to her as if she had
brought her husband to his death. Oh, God, when
I remember how her mother and I suggested other
places  how we talked to her of the Tyrol and the
Dolomites, of Hungary, Norway  and with what a
kind of childish infatuation she clung to her fancy for

this house, it seems as if a hideous fatality guided
her to her doom. It is her doom, as well as his. I
do not believe she will ever he a happy woman
again."

It may seem so now to us all, to herself most of
all, poor girl," answered Matthew Dalbrook. *' But
I never saw a sorrow yet that Time could not heal,
and the sorrow of a girl of nineteen leaves such a
wide margin for Time's healing powers. God grant
that you and I may both live to see her bright and
happy again  with a second husband. There is
something prosaic, I feel, in the very sound ; but
there may be some touch of romance even in a
second love."

He did not see the painful change in his son's face
while he was talking : the sudden crimson which
faded slowly to a ghastly pallor. It had never
occurred to Matthew Dalbrook that his son Theodore
had felt anything more than a cousinly regard for
Lord Cheriton's daughter.

The funeral took place on the following Wednesday
 one of those funerals about which people talk

for a month, and in which grief is almost lost sight
of by the majority of the mourners sin a feverish
excitement. The procession of carriages, very few
of them unoccupied, was nearly half a mile long 
the little churchyard at Milbrook could scarcely
contain the mourners. The sisters' husbands were
there, with hats hidden in crape, and solemn countenances
; honestly sorry for their brother-in-law's
death, but not uninterested in his will. All the
district, within a radius of thirty miles, had
been on the alert to pay this last mark of respect
to a young man who had been universally
liked, and whose melancholy fate had moved every
heart.

The will was read in the library, and Juanita
appeared for the first time since her cousins had
been at Cheriton. She came into the room with her
mother, and went to Matthew and his son quietly,
and gave a hand to each, and answered their grave
inquiries about her health without one tear or one
faltering accent ; and then she took her seat beside
her father's chair, and waited for the reading of the
will. It seemed to her as if it contained her husband's

last words, addressed to her from his grave.
He knew when he wrote or dictated those words that
she would not hear them in his lifetime. The will
left her a life-interest in everything, except twenty
thousand pounds in consols to Lady Jane, a few
legacies to old servants and local charities, and a few
souvenirs to college friends. Sir Godfrey had held
the estate in fee simple, and could deal with it as he
pleased. He expressed a hope that if his wife survived
him she should continue to live at the Priory,
and that the household should remain, as far as
possible, unchanged, that no old horse should ever
be sold, and no dogs disposed of in any way off the
premises. This last request was to secure a continuance
of old customs. His father had never
allowed a horse that he had kept over a twelvemonth
to be sold ; and had never parted with a dog. His
own hand shot the horse that was no longer fit for
service ; his own hand poisoned the dog whose life
had ceased to be a blessing.

When the will was finished, and it was by no
means a lengthy document. Lady Jane kissed her
daughter-in-law.

** You will do as he wished, won't you, dearest ? "
she said, softly.

"Live at the Priory  yes. Lady Jane, unless you
will live there instead. It would be more natural
for you to be mistress there. When  when  my
darling made that will he must have thought of meas
an old woman, likely to survive him by a few
years at most, and it would seem natural to him
for me to go on living in his house  to continue to
live  those were his words, you know  to continue
to live in the home of my married life. But all is
different now, and it would be better for you to have
the Priory. It has been your home so long. It is
full of associations and interests for you. I can
live anywhere  anywhere except in this detested
house."

She had spoken in a low voice all the time, so
low as to be quite inaudible to her father and Matthew
Dalbrook, who were talking confidentially
upon the other side of the wide oak table.

My love, it is your house. It will be full of
associations for you too  the memories of his youth.
It may comfort you by-and-by to live among the

things he cared for. And I can be with you there
now and then. You will bear with a melancholy
old woman now and then," pleaded Lady Jane, with
tearful tenderness.

The only answer was a sob, and a clinging
pressure of the hand; and then the three women
quietly left the room. Their interest in the business
was over. Blinds had been drawn up and
Venetian shutters opened. There was a flood of
sunshine on the staircase and in the corridors as
Juanita went back to her room. The perfume of
roses and the breath of summer came in at the
open windows.

*' Oh, God, how the sun shines," she cried, in a
sudden agony of remembrance.

Those odours from the garden, the blue sky, summer
greenery and dazzling summer light brought
back the image of her vanished happiness.
Last week, less than a week ago, she had been one
of the joyous creatures in that glad, gay world 
joyous as the thrush whose song was thrilling upon
the soft sweet air.

Lady Jane's two sons-in-law had drawn near the

oak table at which the lawyer was seated with his
papers before him.

Jessica's husband, Mr. Grenville, was sporting.
His thoughts were centred in his stable, where he
found an all-sufficient occupation for his intellectual
powers in an endless buying, exchanging, selling,
summering and wintering his stud ; in the invention
of improved bits, and the development of new
ideas in saddlery ; in the performance of operations
that belong rather to the professional veterinary
than to the gentleman at large, and in the conversation
of his stud groom. These resources filled up
all the margin that was left for a man who hunted
four days a week in his own district, and who often
got a fifth and even a sixth day in other countries
accessible by rail. It may have been a natural
result of Mr. Grenville's devotion to the stable that
Mrs. Grenville was absorbed by her nursery ; or it
may have been a natural bent on the lady's part.
However this might be, the lady and the gentleman
followed parallel lines, in which their interests never
clashed. He talked of hardly anything but his
horses ; she rarely mentioned any other subject than

her children, or something hearing upon her children's
well-being. He believed his horses to be the
best in the county ; she considered her babies
unsurpassed in creation. Both in their line were
supremely happy.

Mr. Morningside, married to Sir Godfrey's
younger sister, Ruth, was distinctly Parliamentary ;
and had no sympathies in common with such menas
Hugo Grenville. To him horses were animals
with four legs who dragged burdens; who were
expensive to keep, and whose legs were liable to
fill " or to develop superfluous bone on the slightest
provocation. His only idea of a saddle horse
was a slow and stolid cob, for whose virtuous disposition
and powerful bone he had paid nearly three
hundred pounds, and on which he pounded round
the park three or four times every morning during
the Parliamentary season, an exercise of which he
was about as fond as he was of Pullna water, but
which had been recommended him for the good of
his liver.

Mr. Morningside had a castle in the north, too
near Newcastle to be altogether beautiful, and he

had a small suite upon a fifth floor in Queen Anne's
Mansion. He had taken this apartment as a
bachelor x>ied a terre for the Parliamentary season ;
and he had laid considerable emphasis upon the
landowner's necessity for stern economy which had
constrained him to take rooms so small as to be
altogether " impossible " for his wife. Mrs. Morn-inside
was, however, of a different opinion. No
place was impossible for her which her dear Stuart
deigned to occupy. She did not mind small rooms,
or a fifth story. Was there not a lift, and were
there not charming people living ever so much
nearer the skies ? She did not mind even what she
gracefully described as "pigging it," for her dear
Stuart's sake. She was utterly unlike her elder
sister, and she had no compunction at placing
over two hundred miles between her and her
nursery.

*' They'd wire for me if anything went wrong,"
she said, *' and the express would take me home ina
few hours."

That would depend upon what time you got the
wire. The express doesn't go every quarter of an

VOL. I. P

hour like a Royal Blue," replied Mr. Morningside,
gloomily.

He was a dry-adust man ; one of those self-satisfied
persons who are never less alone than when
alone. He had married at five-and-thirty, and the
comfortable habits of a priggish bachelor still clove
to him after six years of married bliss. He was
fond of his wife in her place, and he thought her a
very charming woman at the head of his table, and
receiving his guests at Morningside Castle. But it
was essential to his peace that he should have many
solitary hours in which to pore over Blue books and
meditate upon an intended speech. He fancied
himself greatly as a speaker, and he was one of
those Parliamentary bores whose ornate periods are
made mincemeat of by the reporters. He looked to
a day when he would take his place with Burke and
Walpole, and other giants, whose oratory had been
received coldly in the dawn of their senatorial
career. He gave himself up to much study of
politics past and present, and was one of those well-informed
bores who are only useful as a store-house
of hard facts for the use of livelier speakers.

When a man had to speak upon a subject of which
he knew nothing, he went to Mr. Morningside as to
a Parliamentary Encyclopaedia.

To sustain these stores of knowledge Mr. Morn-inside
required much leisure for what is called
heavy reading ; and heavy reading is not easy in
that genial family life which means incessant talk
and incessant interruption. Mr. Morningside
would have preferred, therefore, to keep his den on
the fifth floor to himself; but his wife loved London,
and he could not refuse her the privilege of
occasionally sharing his nest on a level with the
spires and towers of the great city. She made her
presence agreeably felt by tables covered with photograph
easels, Yallauris vases, stray flowers in specimen
glasses, which were continually being knocked
over, Japanese screens, and every known variety of
chair-back ; and albeit he was an essentially dutiful
husband, Mr. Morningside never felt happier than
when he had seen his Ruth comfortably seated in
the Bournemouth express on her way to the home
of her forefathers for one of those protracted visits
that no one but a near relation would venture top

2

make. He left her cheerily on such occasions, with
a promise to run down to the Priory on Saturday
evenings whenever it was possible to leave the helm.

Mr. Morningside had liked his brother-in-law as
well as it was in him to like any man, and had been
horrified at that sudden inexplicable doom ; but Sir
Godfrey being snatched off this earth in the flower
of his age, Mr. Morningside thought it only natural
that the young Morningsides should derive some
benefit, immediate or contingent, from their uncle's
estate. It was, therefore, with some disgust that
he heard that clause in the will which gave Jessica's
sons the preference over all the sons of Ruth.
True that failing any son of Jessica's, the estate
was to lapse to the eldest surviving son of Ruth ;
but what earthly value was such a reversionary
interest as this in the case of a lady whose nursery
was like a rabbit warren ?

"I congratulate you on your eldest boy's prospects,
Grenville," said Mr. Morningside, sourly.
* Your Tom," a boy whom he hated, ** will come
into a very fine thing one of these days''

*' Humph," muttered Grenville, *' Lady Carmichael

is a good life, and I should be very sorry
to see it shortened. Besides, wbo can tell ? Before
this time next year there may be a nearer claimant."


Lord have mercy upon us," exclaimed Morning-side,
" I never thought of that contingency."

Poor girl ! put on thy stifling widow's weed,
And 'scape at once from Hope's accursed bands ;
To-day thou wilt not see him, nor tomorrow,
And the next day will be a day of sorrow."

Life falls back into old grooves after calamities
the most stupendous. After fires  after plagues 
after earthquakes  people breakfast and dine, marry
and are given in marriage. A few more graves
testify to the fever that has decimated a city; a
ruined village here and there along the smiling
southern shore, shells that were once houses,
churches beneath whose shivered domes no worshipper
dare ever kneel again, hear witness to
the earthquake ; but the monotonous common-place
of life goes on all the same in city and village, on
hill and sea-shore. And so when Godfrey Carmichael
was laid in his grave, when the police had
exhausted their ingenuity in the vain endeavour to
fathom the secret of his death  when the coroner

had adjourned and again adjourned his inquiry, and
an open verdict had been pronounced, life iu Cheriton
House resumed its old order, and the room in
which the bridegroom had lain murdered at the feet
of the bride was again thrown open to the sun and
air, and to the sound of voices, and to the going
and coming of daily life.

Lady Cheriton would have had the room closed ;
for a year at least, she pleaded ; but her husband
told her that to make it a sealed chamber now would
be to throw it out of use for his lifetime.

"If we once let servants and people think and
talk of it as a haunted room nobody will ever like to
occupy it again so long as this house stands," he
said. *' Stories will be invented  those things shape
themselves unawares in the human mind  sounds
will be heard, and the whole house will become uninhabitable.
We both love our house, Maria. Our
own hands have fashioned it after our own hearts.
It would be folly to put a brand upon it, and to say
henceforward it shall be accursed to us. God
knows I am sorry for Juanita's sorrow, sorry for my
own loss ; but I look to you to help me in keeping

our home bright and pleasant for our declining
days."

It was the habit of her life to obey him and try
to please him in all things ; so she answered
gently,

Of course, dear James, it shall be as you wish.
I feel sure you are right. It would be wicked to
shut up that lovely room "  with a faint shudder ;
but I shall never go near the west window without
thinking of  our dear boy. And I'm afraid
Juanita will never be able to endure the room."

"Perhaps not. We can use the other rooms
when she is here. She has her own house now ;
and I daresay it will be some time before she will
care to cross this threshold. The house must seem
fatal to her. It was her own caprice that brought
him here. I'm afraid that recollection will torture
her, poor child."

It was finally decided therefore that the drawing-room
should be used nightly, as it had been in all
the peaceful years that were gone. The lamps with
their gay shades of rose or amber made spots of
coloured light amidst tables heaped with flowers.

All the choicest blooms that the hothouses or the
gardens could produce were brought as of old, like
offerings to a pagan shrine. The numberless toys
upon the tables were set out in the old orderly disorder
 porcelain and enamel bon-bon boxes on one
table  antique watches and gold and silver snuff-boxes
on another  bronzes, intaglios, coins, medals,
filigree scent bottles upon a third, and a background
of flowers everywhere. The piano was opened, and
the candles lighted ready for her ladyship, who sang
Spanish ballads delightfully even yet, and who was
in the habit of singing to her husband of an evening
whenever they were alone.

They were generally alone now, not being able to
receive visitors from the outside world at such a
time. The Yicar of the parish dined at Cheriton
now and then, and Matthew Dalbrook spent a night
there occasionally, and talked over business matters,
and the future development of a tract of land at
Swanage, which formed a portion of the original
Strangway estate.

The widow had taken possession of her new home,
the home which they two were to have lived in for

half a century of loving union. They had joked
about their golden wedding as they sat at lunch on
the lawn that day ; had laughed at the thought of
how they would look in white hair and wrinkles,
and then had sighed at the thought of how those
they loved now would be gone before that day came,
and how the friends who gathered round them would
be new friends, the casual acquaintances of the
passing years promoted to friendship in the place of
those earlier, nearer, dearer friends whom death had
taken.

They had talked of their silver wedding, which
seemed a happier idea ; for dear Lady Jane and
Juanita's mother and father might all live to see
that day. They would be old, of course, older by
five-and-twenty years ; but not too old to be happy
and beloved. The young wife and husband pictured
the lawn on which they were sitting crowded with
friends and tenants and villagers and children ; and
planned the feasting and the sports, which were to
have a touch of originality, something out of the
beaten track, which something was not easy to
devise.

And now she and Lady Jane were sitting in the
same spot, in the sultry August evening, two desolate
women ; the tawny giant at their feet, his dog, the
mastiff Styx, looking up at them now and then with
great serious eyes, as if asking what had become of
his master.

Juanita was strangely altered since the days of her
honeymoon. Her cheeks had hollowed, and the
large dark eyes looked larger, and gave a haggard
expression to the pallid face ; hut she was bearing
her sorrow bravely for Lady Jane's sake, as Lady
Jane had done for her sake, in the beginning of
things. That gentle lady had broken down after
the funeral, and Juanita had been constrained to
forget her own agony for a brief space in trying to
comfort the bereaved mother ; and so the two acted
and re-acted upon each other, and it was well for
them to be together.

They had settled down in the old house before they
had been there a week. Lady Jane put off her return
to Swanage indefinitely. She could drive over now
and then to supervise the gardening, and she would
stay at the Priory as long as Juanita wanted her.

That would be always," said Juanita.

"Ah, my love, that would not do. I don't forget
all that has been written about mothers-in-law.
There must be some truth in it."

Oh, but you forget. That is when there is a
son and husband to quarrel about," said Juanita,
with a sudden sob. *' We have no cause for jealousy.
We have only our dead."

Lady Jane wanted to establish her daughter-in-law
in that cheerful sitting-room which had been her own,
but here Juanita opposed her.

*' I am not going to have it  now," she said, resolutely.
" It shall be your room always. No one
else shall use it. I am going to have his room for
my den."

My dearest, it is the dullest room in the house."

It was his room, and I like it better than any
other in the world."

She arranged all her own books and possessions in
the large room looking into the stable yard, which
had been Sir Godfrey's study from the time he went
to Eton. She found all his Eton books on a lower
shelf of one of the book-cases, and she sat on the

floor for an hour dusting grammars and dictionary,
first Greek Reader, Latin Gradus, and all the rest of
them. She found his college books, with the college
arms upon them, on another shelf. She would have
nothing disturbed or altered, and she was supremely
indifferent to the question of incongruity. Her own
book-cases from Cheriton, the dainty toy book-cases
of inlaid satin wood, were squeezed into the recesses
on each side of the fireplace. Her photographs of
mother, father, friends, horses, and dogs, were
arranged upon the carved oak mantelpiece, above
the quaint little cupboards with carved doors, spoil
of old Belgian churches, still fall of choice cigars,
the young man's store. His spurs and hunting-crops,
canes, and boxing-gloves, decorated the panel
between the two tall windows. His despatch box
still stood upon the library table, and the dog Styx
pushed the door open whenever it was left ajar and
strolled into the room as by old established right.

She felt herself nearer her dead husband here
than anywhere else ; nearer even than in the churchyard,
where she and Lady Jane went every afternoon
with fresh flowers for his grave. They had not laid

him in the family vault, hut among the graves
of gentle and simple, under the sunny turf. The
marble was not yet carven which was to mark out
his grave amidst those humbler resting-places.

Theodore Dalbrook had not seen his cousin since
the day of the funeral. His father and his two
sisters had called upon her at the Priory, and had
brought hack an account of the quiet dignity with
which she bore herself in her melancholy position.

I did not think she had so much solid sense,"
said Janet, and then she and Sophia talked about
the Priory as a dwelling-house, and of its inferiority
to Cheriton, and speculated upon the amount of their
cousin's income.

She has a splendid position. She will be a fine
catch for some one by-and-by," said Harrington. " I
hope she won't go and throw herself away upon an
adventurer."

*' I hope not," said his father, *' but I suppose
she will marry again? That seems inevitable."

"I don't see that it is inevitable," argued Theodore,
almost angrily. '' She was devotedly attached

to her husband. I suppose there is now and then a
woman who can remain faithful to a first love '*

** When the first love is alive, and not always
then," put in Sophia, flippantly. *' Of course she
will marry again. If she wanted to remain single
people would not let her, with her income."

Theodore got up and walked to the window. His
sister's talk often set his teeth on edge, but rarely so
much as it did to-day.

*' You talk of her as if she were the most shallow-brained
of women," he exclaimed, with his back to
the family group, looking out with gloomy eyes into
the old-fashioned street, the narrow circumscribed
view which he had hated of late with a deadly
hatred.

I don't think she is very deep," answered
Sophia. " She never could appreciate Darwin.
She told me once that she wondered what I could
find to interest me in earth-worms."

** A woman must, indeed, be shallow who feels
no interest in that thrilling subject," sneered Theodore.


"Upon my word, now," said his father, " Darwin's

book interested me, though I'm not a scientific
man. And I never see a worm wriggling off the
gardener's spade without feeling that I ought to be
grateful to him as a factor in the landed interest.
Perhaps," continued Mr. Dalbrook, musingly, '* my
own practice in the conveyancing line owes something
of its substantial character to earth-worms.
If it were not for them there might be no land to
convey."

The conversation drifted lightly away from
Juanita and her sorrow, but her image still filled
Theodore's mind, and he left the drawing-room and
the frivolous talk and the clinking of teacups and
teaspoons, and went out in the declining light to
walk in the avenue of sycamores on the edge of the
old city.

He had not called upon his cousin in her new
home ; he shrank from the very idea of meeting her
while her sorrow was still new, while her thoughts
and feelings were concentrated upon that one subject,
while he could only be to her as an unwelcome
intruder from that outside world she loathed, as
<rief loathes all but its own sad memories.

Had the calamity which had desolated her life
brought her any nearer to him who had loved her
so long and so unselfishly ? Alas, no ; he told himself
that if she ever loved again, it would be to a
stranger that her reawakening heart would open
rather than to the rejected lover of the past, the
man whom her memory would couple with the husband
she had lost, and whom she would compare
disadvantageously with that chosen one.

Xo, he told himself, there was little more chance
for him in the future than there had been in the
past. She liked him and trusted him, with a
sisterly affection which nothing short of a miracle
could warm into love. Passion does not grow out
of such placid beginnings.

In her very dawn of girlhood she had been in love
with Godfrey : had blushed at his coming : had
quarrelled with him, and wept stormy tears : had
suffered all those alternations of joy and grief, pride
and self-abasement, which accompany love in an
impassioned nature. Theodore remembered her
treatment of the fifth-form Etonian, of the undergraduate,
remembered the passionate drama per-vol.

I. Q

equally being acted in those two young lives, a
drama which he had watched with aching heart;
and he felt that he could never be as that first lover
had been. He was associated with the commonplace
of her life. She had laughed often at his
dry-adust talk with her father  the dull discussions
about leases and bills of dilapidation. A
solicitor living from year's end to year's end in a
country town  what a dreary person he must needs
appear beside the brilliant young Patrician, full of
the gladness of the life that knows neither labour
nor care. He sickened at the thought of that contrast.


He had served his father faithfully hitherto, and
the bond between father and son had been one of
strong affection as well as duty ; but for the last
year there had been growing upon him an inexpressible
weariness of the house in which he was born,
and the city in which he had lived the chief part of
his uneventful life. He had struggled against the
disgust of familiar things, telling himself that it
was an unworthy feeling, and that he would be a
snob if he indulged it. Yet the disgust grew into

absolute loathing ; the monotonous days, the repetition
work, oppressed him like a nightmare. Since
Juanita*s marriage the burden had become more and
more intolerable. To be so near her, yet so far.
To be letting life creep away in dull drudgery which
could never bring him nearer her social level; to
feel that all his pursuits and associations were beneath
the woman he loved, and could never arouse
the faintest interest in her mind. This was almost
too bitter to be borne, and he had for some time
past been meditating some way of escape, some
manner of release from these old fetters into the
wider arena of the outer world.

Such escape was not easy. He had to think of
his father, that indulgent, large-minded father who
had given his son a very remunerative share in his
practice at an age when most young men are dependent
for every suit of clothes or five pound note
upon parental bounty and parental caprice. He
knew that his father looked to him for an entire
release from work before they were many years
older ; and that he would then find himself sole
master of a business worth at least fifteen hundred

Q 2

a year. All this had come to him and would come
to him easily, as the reward of conscientious and
intelligent work. It was a prospect which few
young men would forego without considerable hesitation
; but Theodore hardly thought of the substantial
advantages which he was so eager to
sacrifice. His sole hesitation was on account of the
disappointment which the step he contemplated
would inflict upon his father.

He was not without a foreshadowing of a plan
by which that disappointment might be in sometime
lessened. He had kept an eye upon his brother
for some time past, and he had discovered that the
young man's fervour for the Anglican Church had
begun to cool. There were all the signs of wavering
in that gifted youth. At one time he devoted all
his study to the writings of Cardinal Newman,
Harrel Froude, and the Praetorian Party  he lived
in the atmosphere of Oxford in the forties ; he
talked of Cardinal Manning as the head and front
of religious thought. He was on the verge of
deciding for the Old Faith. Then a sudden change
came over the spirit of his dream. He began to

have doubts, not of the reformed faith, but of every
Western creed.

Light comes from the East," he told his sisters
with au oracular air. "I doubt if there is any
nearer resting-place for the sole of my foot than
the Temple of Buddha. I find there the larger
creed for which my mind yearns  boundless
vistas behind and before me. I begin to entertain
painful doubts of my fitness for the Anglican
Church. I might be a power, perhaps, but it
would be outside those narrow bounds  like
Voysey, or Stafford Brooke. The Church,
with its present limitations, would not hold
me."

The sisters sympathized, argued, quoted Essays
and Reviews, and talked of Darwin and Spencer,
Huxley and Comte. Theodore listened and said
nothing. He saw which way the tide was turning,
and rejoiced in the change of the current.

And now this sultry August afternoon, pacing up
and down the green walk, he was expectant of an
opportunity of discussing his brother's future with
that gentleman himself, as Harrington was in the

habit of taking his afternoon constitutional, book in
hand, upon this very path.

He appeared by-and-by, carrying an open volume
of Max Miller and looking at the nurseries and
perambulators.

** What, Theoo, taking your meditative cigar ? You
don't often give yourself a holiday before dinner."

No, but I wanted to talk to you alone, and I
knew this was your beat."

** Nothing gone wrong, I hope."

No, it is your future I want to discuss  if you
don't mind."

My future is wrapped in a cloud of doubt," replied
the younger man, dreamily. " Were the
Church differently constituted  were the minds
that rule in it of a larger cast, a wider grasp,

** Harrington, how would you like the law as a
profession ? " Theodore asked abruptly, when the
other began to hesitate.

** My dear fellow, it is all very well to ask me that
question, when you know there is no room for mein
my father's oSce," retorted Harrington, with a

contemptuous wave of that long, lean white hand,
which always reminded him of St. Francis de Sales
or Savonarola ; not that he had any positive knowledge
of what those saintly hands were like.

Room might be made for you," said Theodore.

*' I should not care to accept a subordinate position
 Aut Caesar "

So far as the Caesar-ship of a provincial solicitor's
office can go the whole empire may be yours
by-and-by, if you like  provided you put your
shoulder to the wheel and pass your examinations."

Do you mean to say that you would throw up
your position  and an income which would allow of
your marrying tomorrow, if you chose  to make
room for me ? "

"If I can get my father's consent, yes,
decidedly."

'* And how do you propose to exist without a
profession 7 ''

I don't propose anything of the kind. I mean
to go to the Bar.

Oh, I begin to understand. A solicitor's office
is not good enough for you ? "

I don't say that ; but I have taken a disgust 
an unreasonable disgust no doubt  to that branch
of the law ; and I am very sick of Dorchester."

So am I," retorted Harrington, gazing vaguely
at a pretty nursemaid. "We are agreed there at
any rate. And you want to follow in Lord Cheriton's
track, and make a great name ? "

*' It is only one man in a thousand who succeeds
as James Dalbrook has succeeded ; but if I go to
the Bar you may be sure I shall do my best to get
on ; and I shall start with a pretty good knowledge
of common law."

You want to be in London  you are pining for
an aesthetic centre," sighed Harrington.

I don't quite know what that is, but I should
prefer London to Dorchester."

So should I  and you want me to take your
place at the mill ; to grind out my soul in the dull
round that has sickened you."

The life has begun to pall upon me, but I think
it ought to suit you," answered Theodore, thoughtfully.
"You are fonder of home  and of the
sisters  than I am. You get on better with them."

You have been rather grumpy lately, I admit,"
said Harrington.

** And you have let yourself cool upon your
Divinity exam. You evidently don't mean the
Church ? "

' I have outgrown the Church. You can't put a
quart of wine into a pint bottle."

And you must do something. I don't think you
can do anything so good as to take my place, and
become my father's right hand until he chooses to
retire, and leave you the practice. You will have
married by that time, perhaps, and will have sobered
down  intellectually. Morally you are one of the
steadiest fellows I know."

I suppose I ought to consider this what the
house-agents call an unusual opportunity?" said
Harrington ; " but you must give me time to think
it over."

** Take time," answered Theodore, briefly. *i'll
talk to my father in the meanwhile."

Mr. Dalbrook received his elder son's communication
as if it had been a blow from an enemy's
hand.

"Do yovL suppose that ass Harrington can ever
take your place?" he exclaimed, whereupon Theodore
took pains to explain that his brother was by no
means an ass, and that he was only labouring under
that burden of small affectations which weighs down
a young man who has been allowed to live too much
in the society of young women, sisters and sisters*
friends, and to consider all his own utterances
oracular.

He is not so fit for the Church as Brown is'*
said Theodore, " and he will only addle his brains if
he reads any more theology. He won't be content
with Paley and Butler, and the good old books which
have been the turnpike road to ordination for a century.
He is all for new ideas, and the new ideas
are too big for him. But if you will give him his
articles, and teach him, as you taught me "

I don't think I taught you much. You seemed
to get at everything by instinct."

** Ah, you taught me my profession without knowing
it ; and you will teach Harrington with just as
little trouble. He will shake off that husk of affectation
in your office  no solicitor can be affected  and

he will come out a good lawyer ; while I am trying
my luck in Temple chambers, reading, and waiting
for briefs. With your help, by-and-by, I am bound
to do something. I shall get a case or two upon
this circuit, anyhow."

"I can't think what has put this folly in your
head, Theoo," said his father, with a vexed air.

*rit is not folly, father; it is not a caprice," the
young man protested, with sudden earnestness.
"For God's sake don't think me ungrateful, or that
I would willingly turn my back upon my duty to you.
Only  young people have troubles of their own,
don't you know ?  and of late I have not been
altogether happy. I have not prospered in my love-dream
; and so I have set up a new idol, that idol
so many men worship with more or less reward 
Success. I want to spread my wings, and see if they
will can-y me on a longer flight than I have taken

yet."

Well, it would be selfish of me to baulk you,
even if your loss were to cripple me altogether. And
it won't do that. I am strong enough to work on
for a few years longer than I intended."

Ob, my dear father, I hope it won't come to that.
I hope my change of plan won't shorten your years
of leisure''

**I am afraid that's inevitable, Theoo. I can't
transfer a fine practice to my son till I've made him a
good lawyer  and God knows how long that will take
in Harrington's case. Judging by my present estimation
of him, I should say half a century. But don't
be coldhearted, Theoo. You shall eat your dinners.
You shall qualify for the Woolsack. After all I don't
know how a life of leisure might suit me. It would bea
change from the known to the unknown, almost
as stupendous as the change from life to death."

Perhaps Matthew Dalbrook had fathomed that
secret woe at which Theodore had hinted darkly ;
in any case he took his elder son's defection more
easily than might have been hoped, and bore
patiently with some preliminary fatuity from the
younger son, who accepted the gift of his articles,
an allowance of two hundred pounds per annum, and
the promise of a junior partnership in the near
future, with the languid politeness of one who felt
that he was renouncing a mitre.

Everything was settled off-hand, and Theodore
was to go to London at the end of September to
select and furnish his modest chambers in one of
those grave old courts of the Temple, and be ready
to begin his new life with the beginning of term.

He had not seen Juanita since the funeral, and
she had been told nothing of this sudden reconstruction
of his life ; but he determined to see her
before he left Dorchester, and he considered that
he had a right, as her kinsman, to bid her good-bye.
Perhaps in his heart-weariness he was inclined to
exaggerate the solemnity of that leave-taking, somewhat
as if he had been starting for Australia.

He drove over to the Priory on a dull, grey afternoon,
his last day in Dorchester. His portmanteaus
were packed, and all things were ready for an early
departure next morning. Sorely as he had sickened
of the good old town which was his birth-place, he
felt a shade of melancholy at the idea of cutting
himself adrift altogether from that quiet haven ;
and the love of those open stretches of barren heath
and those swampy meadows and grazing cattle on
the way to Milbrook, was engrained in him deeper

than he knew. It was a landscape which took a
peculiar charm from the grey dimness of an
autumnal atmosphere, and it seemed to Theodore
Dalbrook that those level pastures and winding
waters had never looked fairer than they looked
to-day.

He had written to his cousin a day before to tell
her of his intended visit. It was too solemn a
matter in his own mind for him to leave the finding
her at home to chance. His groom took the dogcart
round to the stables, while he was ushered at
once to the drawing-room where Lady Carmichael
was sitting at her work-table in the bow window,
with Styx stretched on a lion-skin at her feet.

The silence of the house struck Theodore Dal-brook
painfully as he followed the footman across
the hall and along a corridor which led to the 
 that death-like silence of a roomy old
mansion in which there are neither children nor
guests, only one lonely inhabitant waited upon by
solemn-visaged servants, drilled to a phenomenal
quietness, and keeping all their good spirits for the
remoteness of the servants' hall, shut off by double

doors and long passages. Saddened by that atmosphere
of gloom, he entered his cousin's presence,
and stood with her small cold hand in his, looking
at the face which had changed so sorely from that
vivid beauty which had shone upon him in the low
light of the sinking sun on that summer evening
not three months ago.

As he looked the memory of the bride's face came
between him and the face of the widow, and for a
moment or two he stood speechless. The clearly-cut
features were pinched and sharpened, wasted by
long nights of weeping and long days of silent
regret. The dark eyes were circled by purple
shadows, and the oval cheeks were sunken and pallid.
All the colour and richness of that southern beauty
had vanished, as if some withering blight had
passed over the face.

It was very good of you to think of me before
you left Dorchester," she said, gently.

She pushed forward a chair for her cousin, before
she sat down ; and Theodore seated himself opposite
to her with the wicker work-table between them.
He wondered a little to see that satin-lined receptacle

gorged with bright coloured silks, and
pieces of unfinished embroidery ; for it seemed to
him that there was a touch of frivolity in this light
ornamental needle work which hardly harmonized
with her grief stricken countenance.

** You could not suppose that I should leave without
seeing you," he said ; " I should have come here
weeks ago, only "

Only you wanted to give me time to grow calm,
to teach myself to look my trouble straight in the
face," she said, interpreting his thought. *' That
was very thoughtful of you.  Well, the storm is over
now. I am quite calm, as you see. I daresay
some people think I am getting over it. That is the
usual phrase, is it not ? And so you are going to
the Bar, Theodore. I am glad of that. You are
clever enough to make a name as my father did. It
will be slow work, I suppose ; but it will be a field
worthy of your ambition, which a solicitor's office ina
market town never would be."

'* I have felt the want of a wider field for a longtime
; and I shall feel more interest in a barrister's
work. But I hope you don't] think I am conceited

enough to expect to get on as well as your
father."

"I don't know about that. I think you must
know you are a clever man. I have been wishing
to see you for a long time, Theodore, only I was like
you, I wanted to give myself time to be calm. I
want to talk to you about  the murderer."

** Yes. Have you heard anything? Has there
been any discovery ? "

Nothing. The offer of a reward has resulted
in nothing  not one little scrap of information.
The London detective gave up the business and went
back to town a week after the funeral, having obtained
only negative results. The police hereabouts
are creatures without an idea ; and so unless something
is done, unless some clever brain can solve the
riddle, the wretch who killed my husband may go
down to the grave unpunished."

It is hard that it should be so," said Theodore,
quietly, " yet it is an almost impossible case. There
is not a single indication so fur to put one on the
track  not one little clue."

Not for these dull-brained, mechanical dis-vol.

I. R

covered, perhaps ; but for you or me, Theoo ; for us
who loved him there ought to be light. Think, what
a strange murder it was. Not for gain, remember.
Had it been the hand of a burglar that shot him, I
could understand the difficulty of tracing that particular
criminal among all the criminal classes. But
this murder, which seems utterly motiveless, must
have been prompted by some extraordinary motive.
It was not the act of a maniac ; a maniac must have
left some trace of his presence in the neighbourhood.
A maniac could not have so completely eluded the
police on the alert to hunt him down. There must
have been some indication."

Put madness out of the question, Juanita, what
then?"

"Hatred, Theodore. That is the strongest passion
in the human mind  a savage hatred which
could not be satisfied except with the brightest life
that it had the power to destroy  a relentless hatred
not against him, not against my beloved. What
had he done in all his good life that any one upon
this earth should hate him. But against us 
against my father and mother and me  the usurpers.

the owners of Cheriton Manor ; against us who have
thrust ourselves upon the soil which that wicked race
held so long. Oh, Theodore, I have thought and
thought of this, till the conviction has grown into
my mind  till it has seemed like a revelation from
God. It was one of that wicked family who struck
this blow."

One of your predecessors  the Strangways ? Is
that what you mean, Nita ? "

*' Yes, that is what I mean."

My dear Juanita, it is too wild an idea. What,
after your father has owned the estate nearly a
quarter of a century ? Why should the enemy wait
all those years  and choose such a time?"

** Because there never before was such an opportunity
of striking a blow that should bring ruin
upon us. My father's hope of making his son-in-law
his successor in the peerage was known to a
good many people. It may easily have reached the
ears of the Strangways."

*' My dear girl, the family has died off like rotten
sheep. I doubt if there are any survivors of the
old race."

R 2

Oh, but families are not obliterated so easily.
There is always some one left. There were two sons
and a daughter of the old squire's. Surely one of
those must have left children."

But, Juanita, to suppose that any man could
hate the purchaser of his squandered estate with a
hatred malignant enough for murder is to imagine
humanity akin to devils."

We are akin to devils," cried Juanita, excitedly.
*' I felt that I could rejoice as the devils
rejoice at human suffering if I could see my husband's
murderer tortured. Yes, if he were tied
against a tree, as Indian savages tie their sacrificial
victims  tied against a tree and killed by inches,
with every variety of torture which a hellish ingenuity
can suggest, I would say my litany, like
those savages, my litany of triumph and content.
Yes, Theodore, we have more in common with the
devils than you may think."

** I cannot see the possibility of murder, prompted
by such an inadequate motive," said Theodore,
;slowly, remembering, as he spoke, how Churton had
suggested that the crime looked like a vendetta.

inadequate ! Ah, that depends, don't you see.
Remember, we have not to deal with good people.
The Strangways were always an evil race. Almost
every tradition that remains about their lives is a
story of wrong-doing. And think how small a
wound may be deadly when the blood has poison in
it beforehand. And is it a small thing to see
strangers in a home that has been in one's family
for three centuries ? Again, remember that although
nothing throve on the Cheriton Estate while the
Strangways held it  or at any rate not for the last
hundred years of their holding  no sooner was my
father in possession than the luck changed.
Quarries were developed; land that had been
almost worthless became valuable for building.
Everything has prospered with him. And think of
them outside  banished for ever, like Adam and
Eve out of Paradise. Think of them with hate and
envy gnawing their hearts'*

** There would be time for them to get over that
feeling in four and twenty years. And when you
talk about them, I should like to know exactly whom
you mean. I assure you the general idea is

that they have all died off. That is to say, all of
the direct line."

It is upon that very subject I want to talk to
you, Theodore. Would you like to do me a service,
a very great service ? "

"Nothing would make me happier."

Then will you try to find out all about the
Strangways  if they are really all gone, or if there
are not some survivors, or a survivor, of the last
squire's family ? If you can do that much it will be
something gained. We shall know better what to
think. When I heard that you were going to live
in London, it flashed into my mind that you would
be just the right person to help me, and I knew
how good you had been to me always, and that you
hould help. London is the place in which to make
your inquiries. I have heard my father say that all
broken lives  all doubtful characters  gravitate towards
London. It is the one place where people
fancy they can hide."

** I will do everything in my power to realize your
wish, Juanita. I shall be a solitary man with a
good deal of leisure, so I ought to succeed, if success
be possible."

They were silent for some few minutes, Juanita
being exhausted with the passionate vehemence of
her speech. She took up a piece of embroidery
from the basket, and began, with slow, careful
stitches, upon the petal of a dog rose.

I am glad to see you engaged upon that artistic
embroidery," said Theodore, presently, for the sake
of saying something.

** That means perhaps that you wonder I can
care for such frivolous work as this," she said, interpreting
his recent thought, when his eyes first
lighted on her satin-lined basket with its rainbow-heed
silks. "It seems inconsistent, I dare say;
but this work has helped me to quiet my brain many
a time when I have felt myself on the brink of madness.
These slow regular stitches, the mechanical
movement of my hand as the flowers grow gradually,
stitch by stitch, through the long melancholy day,
have quieted my nerves. I cannot read. Books give
me no comfort, for my eyes follow the page while my
mind is brooding on my own troubles. It is better to
sit and think quietly, while I work. It is better to
face my sorrow."

** Have you been long alone ? "

"No. It is only three weeks since Lady Jane
went back to Swanage ; and she comic to see me
two or three times a week. My father and mother
come as often. You must not think I am deserted.
Every one is very good to me."

*<* They have need to be."

Again there was a brief interval of silence, and
then Juanita closed her basket, and lifted her
earnest eyes to her cousin's face.

** You know all about the Strangways ? " she
inquired.

** I have heard a good deal about them from one
and another. People who live in the country have
long memories, and are fond of talking of the lords
of the soil, even when the race has vanished from
the land. I have heard elderly men tell their after-dinner
stories about the Strangways at my father's
table."

You know the family portraits at Cheriton ? "

"The pictures in the hall? Yes. I have
wondered sometimes that your father should have
kept them there  effigies of an alien race."

I hate them," exclaimed Juanita, shuddering.
'* I always had an uncomfortable feeling about them,
a feeling of strange cold eyes looking at us in secret
enmity; but now I abhor them. There is a girl's
face  a cruel face  that I used rather to admire
when I was a child, and sometimes dream about ;
and on the last night but one  of  my happy life
I looked at that picture with Godfrey, and told
him my feeling about that face, and he told me the
pitiful story of the girl whose portrait we were
looking at. The creature had a sad life, and died in
France, poor and broken-hearted. Two hours later
I heard a strange step upon the terrace  while
Godfrey and I were sitting in the library  a stealthy,
creeping step, coming near one of the open windows,
and then creeping away again. Ashen we looked
out there was no one to be seen."

And this was the night before  Sir Godfrey's
death ? "

Yes. I told my father about it  after  after
my trouble ; and when he questioned the gardeners
he discovered that footprints had been seen by one
of them on the damp gravel the morning after I

heard that ghost-like step. They were strange footprints
the man was sure, or he would not have
noticed them  the prints of a shoe with a flat heel
not of a large foot  hut they were not very distinct,
and he went over them with his roller, and
rolled them out, and thought no more about the
fact till my father questioned him. The next day
was dry and warm, as you know, and the gravel was
hard next night. There were no footprints seen 
afterwards."

Did the gardener trace those marks beyond the
terrace  to the avenue, for instance ? "

Not he. All he did was to roll them out with
his iron-roller."

*' They suggest one point  that the murderer
may have been lurking about on the night before
the crime."

I am sure of it. That footstep would not have
frightened me if there had been no meaning in it.
I felt as a Scotchman does when he has seen the
shadow of the shroud round his friend's figure. It
is a point for you to remember, Theodore ; if you
mean to help me."

** I do mean to help you."

*' God bless you for that promise," she cried,
giving him her hand, " and if you want any further
information about the Strangways there is some one
here who may be useful. Godfrey's old bailiff',
Jasper Blake, lived over ten years at Cheriton.
He only left there when the Squire died, and he
almost immediately entered the service of Godfrey's
father. If you can stay till the evening I will send
for him, and you can ask him as many questions as
you like."

I will stay. There is a moon rather late in the
evening, and I shall be able to get back any time
before midnight. But, Juanita, as an honest man, I
am bound to tell you that I believe you are following
an igtiis fatuus  you are influenced by prejudices
and fancies, rather than by reason."

The snow
Of her sweet coldness hath extinguished qmte
The fire that but even now began to flame."

Theodore Dalbrook, a sensible, hard-headed
man of business, was like a puppet in his cousin's
hands. She told him to toil for her, and he deemed
himself privileged to be allowed so to labour. She
put him upon that which, according to his own conviction,
was an absolutely false track, and he was
compelled to follow it. She bade him think with
her thoughts, and he bent his mind to hers.

Yes, she was right perhaps. It was a vendetta.
Lord Cheriton had lived all these years hemmed
round with unseen, unsuspected foes. They had
not burned his ricks, or tried to burn his dwelling-house;
they had not slandered him to the neighbourhood
in anonymous letters ; they had not
poisoned his dogs or his pheasants. Such petty

malevolence bad been too insignificant for them.
But they bad waited till bis fortunes bad reached
their apogee, till bis only child bad grown from bud
to flower and be bad wedded ber to an estimable
young man of patrician lineage and irreproachable
character. And, just when fate was fairest the
cowardly blow bad been struck  a blow that blighted
one young life, and darkened those two other lives
sloping towards the grave, the lives of father and
mother, rendered desolate because of their daughter's
desolation.

Mastered by that will wbicb was bis law, the will
of the woman be loved, Theodore began to believe
as sbe believed, or at least to think it just possible
that there might be amongst the remnant of the
Strangway race a man so lost and perverted, so
soured by poverty, so envenomed by disgraces and
mortifications, eating slowly into the angry heart,
like rust into iron, that be bad become at last the
very incarnation of malignity  bating the man wbo
had prospered while he had failed, hating the owner
of his people's forfeited estate as if that owner bad
robbed them of it  bating with so passionate a

malevolence that nothing less than murder could
appease his wrath. Yes, there might be such a
man. In the history of mankind there have been
such crimes. They are not common in England,
happily ; but among the Celtic nations they are not
uncommon.

My first brief," mused Theodore, with a grim
smile, as he walked up and down the drawing-room
while his cousin was writing a memorandum requesting
the bailiff's presence. " It is more like a case
entrusted to a detective than submitted to counsel's
opinion ; but it will serve to occupy my mind while
I am eating my dinners. My poor Juanita ! Will
her loss seem less, I wonder, when she has discovered
the hand that widowed her ? "

He dined with his cousin at a small round table
in the spacious dining-room which had held so many
cheerful gatherings in the years that were gone :
the sisters and their husbands, and the sisters'
friends; and Godfrey's college friends; and those
old friends of the neighbourhood who seemed only
a little less than kindred, by reason of his having
known them all his life. And now these two were

sitting here alone, and the corners of the room were
full of shadows. One large circular lamp suspended
over the table was the only light, the carving being
done in a serving-room adjoining.

Juanita was too hospitable to allow the meal to be
silent or gloomy. She put aside the burden of her
grief and talked to her cousin of his family and of
his own prospects ; and she seemed warmly interested
in his future success. It was but a sisterly
interest, he knew, frankly expressed as a sister's
might have been ; yet it was sweet to him nevertheless,
and he talked freely of his plans and hopes.

"I felt stifled in that old street," he told her.
"A man must be very happy to endure life in a
country town."

But you are not unhappy, Theodore ? " she
interrupted, wonderingly.

** Unhappy  no, that would be too much to say,
perhaps. You know how fond I am of my father.
I was glad to work with him, and to feel that I was
useful to him ; but that feeling was not enough to
reconcile me to the monotony of my days. A man
who has home ties  a wife and children  may be

satisfied in that narrow circle ; but for a young man
with his life before him it is no better than a
prison."

**I understand," said Juanita, eagerly. *' I can
fully sympathize with you. I am very glad you are
ambitious, Theodore. A man is worthless who is
without ambition. And now tell me what you will
do when you go to London. How will you begin ?"

*' I shall put up at the Inns of Court Hotel for a
few days while I look about for a suitable set of
chambers, and when I have found them and furnished
them, and brought my books and belongings
from Dorchester, I shall sit down and read law. I
can read while I am qualifying for the Bar. I shall
go on reading after I have qualified. My life will be
to sit in chambers and read law books until someone
brings me business. It hardly sounds like a
brilliant career, does it ? "

** All beginnings are hard," she answered, gently.
** I suppose my father went through just the same
kind of drudgery when he began ? "

*' Well, yes, he must have gone upon the same
lines, I fancy. There is no royal road."

'' And while you are studying law and waiting for
briefs, will you have time to look after my
interests ? "

*' Yes, Juanita. Your interest shall be my first
thought always. If it can make you happier to
discover your husband's murderer "

Happier ! It is the only thing that can reconcile
me to the burden of living."

''If it is for your happiness, you need not fear
that I shall ever relax in my endeavours. I may
fail,  indeed fear I must fail,  but it shall not befor
the lack of earnestness or perseverance."

I knew that you would help me," she said,
fervently, holding out her hand to him across the
table.

Dinner was over, and they vere alone, with the
grapes and peaches of the Priory hothouses, which
were not even second to those of Cheriton, unheeded
upon the table before them.

Blake is in the house by this time, I daresay,"
said Juanita presently. "Would you like to see
him here, and shall I stay, or would you rather talk
to him alone ? "

VOL. I. s

"I had better take him in hand alone. It is
always hard work to get straight answers out of that
sort of man, and any cross current distracts him. His
thoughts are always ready to go off at a tangent."

*' He knows all about the Squire's children. He
can give you any particulars you want about them'*

The butler came into the room five minutes afterwards
with the coffee, and announced the bailiff's
arrival.

Juanita rose at once, and left her cousin to receive
Jasper Blake alone.

He came into the room with rather a sheepish
air. He was about sixty, young looking for his
age, with a bald forehead, and stubbly iron grey
hair, and a little bit of whisker on each sunburnt
cheek. He had the horsey look still, though he had
long ceased to have anything to do with horses
beyond buying and selling cart-horses for the home
farm, and occasionally exhibiting a prize animal in
that line. He was a useful servant, and a thoroughly
honest man, of the old-fashioned order.

Mr. Blake, I want you to give me some information
about old friends of yours. I have a little

business in hand, which indirectly concerns the
Strangway family, and I want to be quite clear in
my own mind as to how many are left of them, and
where they are to be found."

The bailiff rubbed one of his stunted whiskers
meditatively, and shook his head.

There was never many of 'em to leave, sir," he
said, grumpily, " and I don't believe there's any of
'em left anywheres. There seems to have been a
curse upon 'em, for the last hundred years. Nothing
ever throve with them. Look at what Cheriton
is now, and what it was in their time."

"I didn't know it in their time, Mr. Blake."

Ah, you're not old enough ; but your father
knew the place. He did business for the old Squire
till things got too bad  mortgages, and accommodation
bills, and overdrawn accounts at the bank,
and such like, and your father washed his hands of
the business  a long-headed gentleman, your father.
He can tell you what Cheriton was like in the
Squire's time."

Why do you suppose the Strangways are all
dead and gone? "

s 2

Well, sir, first and foremost it's fifteen years
and more since I've heard of any of 'em, and the
last I heard was about as bad as bad could be."

What was that last report ? "

"It was about Master Eeginald  that was the
eldest son, him that was colonel of a Lancer regiment,
and married Lord Dangerfield's youngest
daughter. I remember the bonfires on the hills outby
Students just as if it happened yesterday, but
its more than forty years ago, and I was a boy in
the stables at fourteen shillings a week."

*' Keginakl, the elder son, colonel of Lancers,
married Lord Dangerfield's daughter  about 1840,"
wrote Theodore in a pocket-book which he held
ready for taking notes.

What was it you heard about him ? " he asked.

** Well, sir, it was Mr. de Lacy's servant that
told me. He'd been somewhere in the south with
his master where there was gambling  a place
where the folks make a regular trade of it. It's a
wonderful climate, says Mr. de Lacy's man, and the
gentry go there for their health, and very often
finish by shooting themselves, and it seems Colonel

Strangway was there. He'd come over from Corsica,
which it seems was in the neighbourhood  where
he'd left his poor wife all among brigands and savages
and he was at the tables day and night, and he
had a wonderful run of luck, so that they called him
the king of the place, and it was who but he ?
Howsoever the tide turned suddenly, and he began
losing, and he lost his last sixpence, in a manner of
speaking regular cleaned out, Mr. de Lacy's man
said ; and by-and-by there comes another gentleman,
a Jewish gentleman from Paris, rolling in money,
and playing for the sake of the science, and able to
hold out where another man must have given in ;
and in a week or two he was the king of the place,
and the Colonel was nowhere, just living on tick at
the hotel, and borrowing a fiver from Mr. de Lacy
or any other old acquaintance whenever he had the
chance, and making as much play as he could with
two or three cart wheels, where he used to play with
hundred franc pieces. And so it went on, and he
cut up uncommon rough when anybody happened to
fiend him, and there was more than one row at
the hotel or in the gardens  they don't allow no

rows in the gambling rooms  and just as the
season was coming to an end the Colonel went off
one afternoon to catch the boat for Corsica. The
boat was to start after dark from Nice, and there
was a lot of traffic in the port, but not as much light
as there ought to have been, and the Colonel missed
his footing in going from the quay to the boat, and
went to the bottom like a plummet. Some people
thought he made away with himself on purpose, and
that the one sensible thing he did was to make it
look like accident, so as not to vitiate the insurance
on his life, which Lord Dangerfield had taken care
of, and had paid the premiums ever since the
Colonel began to go to the bad. Anyhow, he never
came up again alive out of that water. His death
was published in the papers : ' Accidentally drowned
at Nice.' I should never have known the rights or
the wrongs of it if Mr. de Lacy hadn't happened to
be visiting here soon afterwards.

Did Colonel Strangway leave no children ? "

*' Neither chick nor child."

*' Do you know if his widow is still living ? "

No, sir. That is the last I ever heard of him or
his."

What about the younger brother ? "
I believe he must be dead too, though I can't
give you chapter and verse. He never married,
didn't Mr. Frederick  not to my knowledge. He
went on board a man-of-war before he was fifteen,
and at five-and-twenty he was a splendid officer and
as fine a young man as you need wish to see ; but
he was too fond of the bottle. China was the ruin
of him, some folks said, and he got court-marshalled
out there, not long after they sacked that
there Summer Palace there was so much talk about ;
and then he contrived to pass into the mercantile
marine, which was a come-down for a Strangway,
and for a few years he was one of their finest officers,
a regular dare-devil ; could sail a ship faster and
safer than any man in the service ; used to race
home with the spring pickings of tea, when tea
wasn't the cheap muck it is now, and when there
weren't no Suez Canal to spoil sport. But he took
to his old games again, and he got broke again,
broke for drunkenness and insubordination ; and
then he went and loafed and drank in Jersey 
where, it's my belief, he died some years ago."

"You have no positive information about his
death ? "

'* I can't say that I have."

There was one daughter, I think ? "

"Yes, there was a daughter. Miss Eva. I
taught her to ride. There wasn't a finer horsewoman
in Dorsetshire, but a devil of a temper  the real
vStrangway temper. I wasn't surprised when I
heard she'd married badly ; I wasn't surprised
when I heard she'd run away from her husband."

Did she leave any children ? "

"No, not by him."

But afterwards  do you know if there were
children ? "

I can't say that I do. She was living in
Boulogne when I last heard of her, and somebody
told me afterwards that she died there."

That's vague. She may be living still."

"I don't think that's likely. It's more than
ten years  ay, it's nearer fifteen  since I heard
of her death. She was not the kind of woman
to hide her light under a bushel for a quarter of a
century. If she were alive I feel sure we should

Lave heard of her at Cheriton. Lord ! how fond
she was of the place, and how proud she was of her
good looks and her old name, and how haughty and
overhearing she was with every other young woman
that ever came in her way."

** She must have been a remarkably disagreeable
young person, I take it."

'well, not altogether, sir. She had a taking
way when she wasn't in her tantrums, and she was
very good to the poor people about Cheriton. They
doated upon her. She never quarrelled with them.
It was with her father she got on worst. Those
two never could hit it off. They were too much
alike ; and at last, when she was close upon
seventeen, and a regular clipper, things got so bad
that the Squire packed off the governess at an
hour's warning. She was too young and silly to
manage such a pupil as Miss Strangway, and ifs
my belief she sided with her in all her mischief,
and made things worse. He turned her out of
doors neck and crop, and a week afterwards
he took his daughter up to London and handed
her over to an English lady, who kept a finishing

school somewhere abroad, at a place called
Losun."

At Lausanne, I think."

Yes, that was the name. She was to stay
there for a year, and then she was to have another
year's schooling in Paris to finish her; but she
never got to Paris, didn't Miss Eva. She ran off
from Lausanne with a lieutenant in a marching
regiment, and her father never saw her face again.
He had no money to give her if she had married
ever so well, but he took a pride in striking her
name out of his will all the same."

'' What was her husband's name?"

*' Darcy  Tom Darcy. He was an Irishman,
and I've heard he treated her very badly."

Do you know how long it was after her marriage
that she left him?"

*'I only know when I heard they were parted,
and that was six or seven years after she ran away
from Lausanne."

How long was that before the Squire's death
and the sale of the estate ? "

"Nearly ten years, I should say."

** That makes it about thirty-four years ago ?"

"Yes, that's about it."

Theodore noted down the date in bis book. He
had heard all these things before now  loosely, and
in a disjointed fashion  never haying been keenly
interested in the vicissitudes of the Strangways.

"Who was the man who took her away from her
husband?"

"God knows," said Jasper. "None of us at
Cheriton ever heard. AYe fancied he must have
been a Frenchman, for she was heard of afterwards
a good many years afterwards  at Boulogne.
Our old Yicar saw her there the year before he
died  it must have been as late as sixty-four or
sixty-five, I fancy  a wreck, he said. He wouldn't
have recognized her if she hadn't spoken to him,
and she had to tell him who she was. I heard him
tell my old master all about it, one summer afternoon
at the Vicarage gate, when Sir Godfrey had
driven over to see him. Yes, it must have been as
late as sixty-five, I believe."

"Five years after Lord Cheriton bought the
estate?"

About that."

**Do you remember the name of Miss Strangely's
governess ? Of course, you do, though."

The bailiff rubbed his iron grey whisker with a
puzzled air.

My memory's got to be like a corn-sieve of late
years," he said, ** but I ought to remember her
name. She was at Cheriton over four years, and I
only wish I had a guinea for every time I've sat
behind her and Miss Strangway in the pony chaise.
She was a light-hearted, good-tempered young
woman, but she hadn't bone enough for her work.
She wasn't up to Miss Strangway's weight. Let
me see now  what was that young woman's name ?
she was a good-looking girl, sandy, with a high
colour and a freckled skin. I ought to remember."

Take a glass of claret, Mr. Blake, and take
your time. The name will come back to you.
Have you ever heard of the lady since she left
Cheriton ? "

** Never  she wasn't likely to come back to this
part of the world after having been turned out neck
and crop, as she was. What was the name of the

man who saw the apple fall ?  Xewton  that was
it, Sarah Newton. Miss Strangway used to call
her Sally. I remember that."

Do you know where she came from, or what
her people were ? "

** She came from somewhere near London, and
it's my opinion her father kept a shop ; but she was
very close about her home and her relatives."

** And she was young, you say *? "

*' Much too young for the place. She couldn't
have been five-and-twenty when she left ; and a
girl like Miss Strangway, a motherless girl, wanted
some one older and wiser to keep her in order."

"Had the Squire's wife been long dead at that
time?"

*' She died before I went to service at Cheriton,
Miss Eva couldn't have been much above seven
years old when she lost her mother."

Theodore asked no more questions, not seeing his
way to extracting any further information from the
bailiff. He had been acquainted with most of
these facts before, or had heard them talked about.
The handsome daughter who ran away from a

foreign school with a penniless subaltern  the
Strangway temper, and the pitched battles between
the spendthrift father and the motherless unmanageable
girl  the life-long breach, and then a
life of poverty and an untimely death in a strange
city, only vaguely known, yet put forward as a
positive and established fact. He had heard all
this : but the old servant's recollections helped him
to tabulate his facts  helped him, too, with the
name of the governess, which might be of some use
in enabling him to trace the story of the last of the
Strangways.

If there is any ground for Juanita's theory, I
think the man most likely to have done the deed
would be the Colonel of Lancers, supposed to be
drowned at Nice. If I were by any means to
discover that the story of the drowning was a
mistake, and that the Colonel is in the land of the
living, I should be inclined to adopt Juanita's view
of the murder."

He encouraged the bailiff to take a second glass
of claret, and talked over local interests with him for
ten minutes or so, while his dog-cart-seas being

brought round ; and then, Mr. Blake having withdrawn,
he went to the drawing-room where Juanita
was sitting at work by a lamp-lit table, and wished
her good night.

"Did you find Jasper intelligent?" she asked,
eagerly.

Very intelligent."

And did you find out all you wanted from
him?"

Not quite all. He told me very little that I did
not know before ; but there were one or two facts
that may be useful. Good night, Nita, good night,
and good-bye."

Not for long," she answered. " You will spend
Christmas at home, of course."

Yes, I shall go home for the Christmas week, I
suppose."

You will have something to tell me by that
time, perhaps. You will be on the track."

Don't be too sanguine, Nita. I will do my
uttermost."

'' I am sure you will. Ah, you don't know how I
trust you, how I lean upon you. God bless you.

Theodore. You are my strong rock. I, who never
had a brother, turn to you as a sister might. If you
can do this thing for me if you can avenge his
cruel death "

If  what then, Juanita ? " he asked, paling suddenly,
and his eyes flaming.

I shall honour  esteem you  as I have never
done yet , and you know I have always looked up to
you, Theodore. God bless and prosper you. Goodnight."


Her speech, kind as it was, fell upon his enthusiasm
like ice. He was holding both her hands,
almost crushing them unawares in his vehemence.
Then his grip loosened all at once, he bent his head,
gently kissed those slender hands, muttered a husky
good night, and hurried from the room.

The God of love  ah, benedicite !
How mighty and how great a Lord is he 1 "

A WEEK later Theodore Dalbrook was established
in chambers on the second floor of No. 2, Ferret
Court, Temple.

Ferret Court is one of the few places in the
Temple which have not been improved and beautified
out of knowledge within the last thirty years.
The architect and the sanitary engineer have passed
by on the other side, and have left Ferret Court to
its original shabbiness. Its ceilings have not been
elevated, or its windows widened, nor has the Early-english
stone front replaced the shabby old brickwork.
Its time has not come. The rooms are
small and low, the queer old closets where generations
of lawyers have kept their goods and chattels
are dark and redolent of mice. The staircases are
rotten, the heavy old barristers are black with age,

VOL. I. T

and the deep old window seats are set in windows of
the early Georgian era.

The chambers suited Theodore, first because they
were cheap, and next because the sitting-room, which
was at the back, commanded a good view of the
river. The bedroom was a tolerable size, and there
was a dressing-room just big enough to hold bath
and boots. He furnished the rooms comfortably,
with solid old-fashioned furniture, partly consisting
of surplus articles sent from the old house in Dorchester,
and partly of his own purchases in London.
The rooms were arranged with a sober taste which
was by no means inartistic, and there was just
enough bright colouring in the Algerian porters
and a few handsome pieces of Oriental crockery to
relieve the dark tones of old oak and Spanish
mahogany. Altogether the chambers had the
established look of a nest which was meant to last
through wind and weather, a shelter in which a man
expected to spend a good many years of his life.

He had another reason for choosing those old
rooms in Ferret Court in preference to chambers in
any of those new and commodious houses in the

courts that had been rebuilt of late years. It was
in this house that James Dalbrook had begun his
legal career ; it was here, on the ground floor, that
the future Lord Cheriton had waited for briefs
nearly forty years ago ; and it was here that fame
and fortune had first visited him, a shining apparition,
bringing brightness into the shabby old rooms,
irradiating the gloomy old court with the glory of
triumphant ambition, hopes suddenly realized, the
consciousness of victory. James Dalbrook had
occupied those dingy chambers fifteen years, and
long after he became a great man, and he had gone
from them almost reluctantly to a spacious first-floor
in King's Bench Yalk. He had enjoyed the
reputation of a miser at that period of his life. He
was never known to give a dinner to a friend ; he
lived in a close retirement which his enemies stigmatized
as a hole-and-corner life ; he was never seen
at places of amusement ; he never played cards, or
bet upon a race. Socially he was unpopular.

Theodore had taken all the preliminary steps, and
had arranged to read with a well-known special
pleader. He was thoroughly in earnest in his deter

2

mention to succeed in this new line. He wanted to
prove to his father that his abandonment of the
Dorchester office was neither a caprice nor a folly.
He was even more in earnest in his desire to keep
his promise to his cousin Juanita.

Almost his first act upon arriving in London had
been to go to Scotland Yard in the hope of finding
the detective who had been sent to Cheriton, and his
inquiries there were so far successful that he was
able to make an appointment with Mr. Churton for
the next day but one.

He had talked with Churton after the adjourned
inquest, and had heard all that the professional
intellect had to offer in the way of opinion at that
time ; but he thought it worth his while to find
out if the detective's ideas had taken any new
development upon subsequent reflection, and also to
submit Juanita' s theory to professional consideration.
He was not one of those amateurs who think that
they are cleverer at a trade than the man who has
.served a long apprenticeship to it.

Have you thought anything more about the
heritor murder since last July, Mr. Churton ? " he

asked ; " or has your current work been too engrossing
to give you time for thought ? "

"Xo, sir. I've had plenty of other cases to think
about, but I'm not likely to forget such a case as that
at Heritor, a case in which I was worsted more completely
than I have been in anything for the last ten
years. I've thought about it a good bit, I can assure
you, Mr. Dalbrook."

And do you see any new light ? "

"No, sir. I stick pretty close to my original
opinion. Sir Godfrey Carmichael was murdered by
somebody that bore a grudge against him ; and
there's a woman at the bottom of it."

*' Why a woman 7 Might not a man's hatred be
deadly enough to lead to murder 7 "

Not unless he was egged on by a woman ; or
bad been jilted by a woman ; or was jealous of a
woman ; or thought he had a woman's wrongs to
avenge''

*' Is that what your experience teaches you, Mr.
Churton?"

** Yes, Mr. Dalbrook, that is what my experience
teaches me."

And you think it was an enemy of Sir Godfrey's
who fired that shot ? ' '

*dido."

'* Do you think the enemy was a woman  the
hand that pulled the trigger a woman's hand ? "

No, I do not. A woman couldn't have been
about the place without being remarked  or got clear
off, as a man might."

There are the servants. Could the murderer
be one of them ?"

I don't think so, sir. I've taken stock of 'them
all  stables  lodges  everywhere. I never met
with such a superior set of servants. The person at
the west lodge is a lady bred and born, I should say.
She gave me a good deal of information about the
household. I consider h(;r a remarkably intelligent
woman, and I know she is of my opinion as to the
motive of the murder."

And yet if I tell you that Sir Godfrey had not
an enemy in the world ? " said Theodore, dwelling
on the main point, and not particularly interested
in what the highly-intelligent Mrs. Porter might
have said upon the subject.

I should tell you, sir, that no man can answer
for another man. There is something in the lives of
most of us that we would rather keep dark."

I don't believe there was any dark spot in Sir
Godfrey's life. But what if there were an enemy of
Lord Cheriton's  a man who has been a judge is ina
fair way to have made enemies  a foe vindictive
enough to strike at him through his son-in-law, to
smite him by destroying his daughter's happiness ?
She is his only child, remember, and all his hopes
and ambitions centre in her."

Well, Mr. Dalbrook, if there was such a man
he would be an out-and-out blackguard."

"Yes, it would be a refinement of cruelty  a
Satanic hate ; but such a man might exist. Remember
the murder of Lord Mayo  one of the
wisest and most beloved of India's rulers. The
wretch who killed him had never seen his face till
the day of the murder. He thought himself unjustly
condemned, and he killed the man who represented
the Power which condemned him. Might
not some wrong-headed Englishman have the same
vindictive feeling against an English judge ? "

*' Yes, it is possible, no doubt."

"My cousin, Lady Carmichael, has another
theory."

Theodore explained the positions of Lord Cheriton
and the race that preceded him as owners of the soil,
and Juanita's suspicion of some unknown member
of the Strangway family ; but the detective rejected
this notion as unworthy of professional consideration.


** It is like a young lady to get such an idea into
her head," he said. ** If the estate had changed
hands yesterday  well, even then I shouldn't suspect
the former owners of wanting to murder the
purchaser's son-in-law ; but when you reflect that
Lord Cheriton has been in peaceful possession of
the property for more than twenty years the idea
isn't worth a moment's thought. What put such
a fancy into the lady's head, do you think, Mr.
Dalbrook?'*

** Grief ! She has brooded upon her loss until her
sorrow has taken strange shapes. She thinks that
it is her duty to help in bringing her husband's
murderer to justice. She has racked her brains to

discover the motive of that cruel crime. She has
conjured up the image of incarnate hatred, and she
calls that image by the name of Strangway. I
have pledged myself to act upon this idea of hers
as if it were inspiration, and the first part of my
task will be to find out any surviving member of
Squire Strangway's family. He only left three children,
so the task ought not to be impossible."

"You don't mean, sir, that 3-0U are going to act
upon the young lady's theory ? "

I do mean it, Mr. Churton, and I want you to
help me ; or at any rate to give me a lesson. How
am I to begin ? ' '

He laid his facts before the detective, reading
over the notes which he had elaborated from Jasper
Blake's reminiscences and from his own recollection
of various conversations in which the Strangways
had figured.

Churton listened attentively, nodded, or shook his
head occasionally, and was master of every detail
after that one hearing.

Jersey is not a large place. If I were following
up this inquiry I should 0 first for the son who

is supposed to have died in Jersey," he said, when
he had heard all. "I should follow that line as far
as it goes, and then I should hunt up the particulars
of the Colonel's death, the gentleman who was
drowned at Nice. If any Strangway had a hand in
the business, it must have been one of those two, or
the son of one of them. But I tell you plainly,
Mr. Dalbrook, that I don't put any faith in that
poor lady's notion  no, not that much," said the
detective, snapping his fingers contemptuously.

Yet it was you yourself who first mooted the
idea of a vendetta."

*' So it was ; but I didn't mean a vendetta on
such grounds as that. An estate changes hands,
and  after twenty years and more  the original
holders try to murder the son-in-law of the purchaser!
That won't hold water, sir. There's not
enough human passion in it. I've had to study
humanity, Mr. Dalbrook. It's been a part of my
profession, and perhaps I've studied human nature
closer than many a philosopher who sits in his
library and writes a book about it. Now, there's no
human nature in that notion of Lady Carmichael's.

A man may be very savage because his spendthrift
father has squandered his estate, and he may feel
savage with the lucky man who bought and
developed that estate, and may envy him in his
enjoyment of it  but he won't nurse his wrath for
nearly a quarter of a century, and then give expression
to his feelings all at once with a revolver.
That isn't human nature."

How about the exception to every rule ? Might
not this be an exceptional case ? '*

It might, of course. There's no truer saying
than that fact is stranger than fiction ; but for all,
that this notion of Lady Carmichael's is a 3'oung
lady's notion, and it belongs to fiction and not to
fact. I wouldn't waste my time upon it, if I were
you, Mr. Dalbrook."

I must keep my promise, Mr. Churton. I am
obliged to you for your plain speaking, and I am
inclined to agi-ee with you ; but I have made a promise,
and I must keep it."

** Naturally, sir; and if in the course of your
inquiries I can be of any use to you, I shall be very
glad to co-operate."

"I rely on your help. Remember there is a
handsome reward to be earned by you if you can
bring about the discovery of the murderer. My
part in the search will count for nothing."

''I understand, sir. That's a stimulus, no
doubt ; but I hardly wanted it. When a case
baffles me as this case has done, I would work day
and night, and live on bread and water for a month,
to get at the rights of it. Good-day. You've got
my private address, and you can wire me any-when."


You're a Sussex man, Mr. Churton, I fancy? "

'* Born in the village of Chamber."

Theodore left Waterloo the following evening, and
landed at St. Heliers on the following morning an
hour or so before noon. He landed on the island
as an absolute stranger, and with the vaguest idea
of the work that lay before him, but with the determination
to lose no time in beginning that work.
He sent his valise to Brett's Hotel, and he walked
along the pier to the town, and inquired his way to
the Police Office. He was not going in quest of

information about a member of the criminal
classes ; but the man he was hunting had been a
notorious drunkard, and it seemed to him that in a
small settlement like St. Heliers such a man would
have been likely to attract the attention of the
police at some stage of his downward career.

The first official whom Theodore interrogated had
never heard of the name of Strangway in the
island ; but an elderly inspector appearing presently
upon the scene, and listening attentively to the conversation,
made a suggestion.

'' You say the gentleman was fond of drink, sir,
and in that case he'd be likely to have his favourite
public, where they'd know all about him. Now,
there are not so many taverns in St, Heliers where
a sea-captain, and a broken-down gentleman, would
care to enjoy himself. He wouldn't go to a low
place, you see ; and he wouldn't fancy a swell place.
It would be some house betwixt and between, where
he'd be looked up to a bit  and it would be something
of a sea-faring place, you may be sure.
There ain't so many but what you could look in at
'em all, and ask a few questions, and get on the

right track. I can give you the names of two or
three of the likeliest."

I shall be much obliged," said Theodore. "I
think it's a capital idea."

The inspector wrote down the names of three
taverns, tore the leaf out of his pocket-book, and
banded it to Mr. Dalbrook.

If you don't hear of him at one of those, I
doubt if you'll hear of him anywhere on the islands
he said. " Those houses are all near the pier and
the quays. It won't take you long to go from one
to the other. * The Rose and Crown,' that's where
the English pilots go ; * La Belle Alliance,' that's a
French house with a table cVhote, They've got a
very good name for their brandy, and it's a great
place for broken-down gentlemen. You can get a
good dinner for half-a-crown with i/ir ordinaire included."


*' I'll try the ' Belle Alliance ' first," said Theodore.
'* It sounds likely."

"Yes, I believe it's about the likeliest," replied
the inspector.

The "Belle Alliance" fronted the quay, and

stood at the corner of a shabby old street. There
was a church close by, and a dingy old churchyard.
Everything surrounding the " Belle Alliance " was
shabby and faded, and its outlook on the dirty quay
and the traffic of ugly waggons and uglier trucks,
hogsheads and lumber of all kinds, was depressing
in the extreme.

But the tavern itself had an air of smartness
which an English tavern would hardly have had in
the same circumstances. The interior was gay
with much looking-glass, and a good deal of tarnished
gilding. There were artificial flowers in
sham silver vases on the tables, and there was a
semi-circular counter at one end of the restaurant,
behind which a ponderous divinity', still youthful,
but expansive, sat enthroned, her sleek, black
hair elaborately dressed, her forehead ornamented
with accroche-coeurs, and a cross of Jersey diamonds
sparkling upon her swan-like throat, which
was revealed by one of those open collars which
are dear to the lower order of French women. There
was a row of tables in front of the windows which
looked towards the quay, and there was a long,

narrow table in the middle of the room, laid for
the table dliote dejeuner ; but as yet the room was
empty, save for one young man and woman, of
the tourist order, who were whispering and tittering
over a cafe complet at one of the small tables
furthest from the buffet.

Theodore went straight to the front of the buffet,
and saluted the lady enthroned there.

Madame speaks English, no doubt? "

*' Oh, yes, but a beetle. I am live long time
in Jersey, where is more English as French
peoples."

After this sample speech it seemed to him that
he might get on better with the lady in her native
tongue, so he asked her for a cup of coffee in her
own language, and stood at the counter while he
drank it, and talked to her of indifferent matters,
she nothing loth.

"You have lived a long time in Jersey," he said.
*' Does that mean a long time in this house ? "

Except one year I have lived in this house all
the time, nine years. I was only nineteen when I
undertook the position of dame dii comiotoir. I

could not have undertaken such a responsibility
with a stranger, but the proprietor is my uncle, and
he knew how to be indulgent to my youth and inexperience."


And then, a handsome face is always an attraction.
You must have brought him good fortune,
madame."

He is kind enough to say so. He found it
difficult to dispense with my services while I was
absent, though he had a person from London who
had been much admired at the Crystal Palace."

And you, madame. "as it a feminine caprice,
the desire for change, which made you abandon
your uncle during that time ? "

"I left him when I married," replied the lady,
with a profound sigh. " I returned to him a heartbroken
widow."

Pray forgive me for having recalled the memory
of your grief. I am a stranger in this place, and I
am here on a somewhat delicate mission. My first
visit is to this house, because I knew I should find
intelligence and sympathy here rather than among
my own countrymen. I am fortunate in meeting

VOL. I. U

with a lady who has occupied an important position
at St. Hewers for so long a period. I have strong
reasons for wishing to discover the history of a
gentleman who came to the Island some years ago
I do not know how many  after having been unfortunate
in the world. He was a naval man."

'* My poor husband was a naval man," sighed
the dame du comptoir.

'* A pilot, no doubt," thought Theodore.

Theodore's manner, which was even more flattering
than his words, had made a favourable impression,
and the lady was disposed to be confidential.
She glanced at the clock, and was glad to see that
it was only twenty minutes past twelve. There was
time for a little further conversation with this handsome,
well-bred Englishman, before the habitues of
the ** Belle Alliance " came trooping in for the half-past
twelve o'clock table d'hote. Already the atmosphere
was odorous with fried sole and ragout de
mouton,

The gentleman of whom I am in quest is reported
to have died on the Island," he continued ;
'* but this is very likely to have been a false report,

and it is quite possible that Captain Strangway may
still "

Captain Strangway," echoed the woman, with
an agitated air.

Yes, I see you know all about him. You can
help me to find him."

'' Know him ! " cried the woman. '* I should
think I did know him, to my bitter cost. Captain
Strangway was my husband."

Good Heavens ! "

** He was my husband. The people will be herein
a few minutes. If monsieur will do me the
honour to step into my sitting-room, we can talk
without interruption."

u 2

The comfort is, you shall be called to no more payments,
fear no more tavern bills."

The dame du comptoir beckoned a waiter, and
delegated some portion of her supreme authority to
him for the next quarter of an hour. She constituted
as it were a Regency, and gave her subordinate
command over her wine and liqueur bottles, her Fine
champagne, Bass and Guinness ; and then she
ushered Theodore Dalbrook into a very small sitting-room
at the back of the counter, so small indeed
that a large looking glass, a porcelain stove, two armchairs,
and one little table left hardly standing
room.

Theodore followed with a sense of bewilderment.
He had told himself that the Island of Jersey was
a world so small that he could not have much difficulty
in tracing any man who had lived and died

there within the last ten years ; but accident had
been kinder to him than he had hoped.

The lady seated herself in one of the ruby velvet
arm chairs, and motioned him to the other.

You have given me a shock, monsieur," she
said. " My friends in the island know that my
marriage was unfortunate, and they never mention
my husband. He is forgotten as if he had never
been. I sometimes fancy that year of my life was
only a troubled dream. Even my name is unchanged,
I was called Mille. Coralieie before I married. I am
called Madame Coralieie now."

I am sorry to have caused you painful emotion,
madame, but it is most important to me to trace the
history of your husband's later years, and I deem
myself very fortunate in having found you."

Is it about a property, a fortune left him, perhaps
? ' ' exclaimed Coralieie, with sudden animation,
her fine eyes lighting up with hope.

** Alas, no. Fortune had nothing in reserve for
your unlucky husband."

Unlucky, indeed, but not so unlucky as I was in
giving my heart to him. I knew that he was a

drunkard. I knew that lie had been turned out of
the navy, and out of the mercantile marine on
account of that dreadful vice  but he  he was very
fond of me, poor fellow, and he swore that he would
never touch a glass of brandy again as long as he
lived, if I would consent to marry him. He did
turn over a new leaf for a time, and kept himself
sober and steady, and would hang over that counter
for a whole evening talking to me, and take nothing
but black coffee. I thought I could reform him. I
thought it would be a grand thing to reform a manlike
that, a gentleman bred and born, a man whose
father had been a great landowner, and whose family
name was one of the oldest in England. He was a
gentleman in all his ways. He never forgot himself
even when he had been drinking. He was a gentleman
to the last. Such a fine-looking man too.
While he was courting me and kept himself steady
he got back his good looks. He looked ten years
younger, and I was very proud of him the day we
were married. He had taken a house for me, a nice
little house on the hill near the Jesuits' College, with
a pretty little garden, and I had furnished the house

out of my savings. I had saved a goodish bit since
I came to Jersey, for my uncle is a generous man,
and my situation here is a good one. I had over two
hundred pounds in hand after I paid for the furniture
 these chairs were in my drawing-room  and he
hadn't much more than the clothes he stood upright
in, poor fellow. But I wouldn't have minded that if
he had only kept himself steady. I was prepared to
work for him. I knew I should have to keep him.
He was too much of a gentleman to be able to work
except in his profession, and that was gone from him
for ever ; so I knew it was incumbent on me to work
for both, and I thought that by letting our drawing-room
floor in the season, and by doing a little
millinery all the year round  I'm a good milliner,
monsieur  I thought I could manage to keep a comfortable
home, without touching my two hundred
pounds in the Savings Bank."

You were a brave, unselfish girl to think so."
Ah, sir, we are not selfish when we love. I was
very fond of him, poor fellow. I had begun with
pitying him, and then he was a thoroughbred gentleman
 he was vielle roche, monsieur, and I have

always admired the noblesse. I am no Republican,
moi. x\nd he had such winning ways when he was
sober  and he was not stupid as other men are when
he was drunk  only more brilliant  la tete monte
helaSj comme il petillait d' esprit  but it was his
brain that he was burning  that was the fuel that
made the light. But how is it you interest yourself
in him, monsieur? " she asked, suddenly, fixing him
with her sharp black eyes. *you say it is not
about property. You must have a motive, all the
same."

** I have a motive, but my interest is not personal.
I am acting for some one who now owns the Strangely
estate, and who wishes to know what has
become of the old family."

What can it matter to any one ? " asked Madame
Coralieie, suspiciously. " They had lost all their
money  of the land that had been theirs not an acre
was left. What business is it of any one's what
became of them when they were driven from their
birth-place. Oh, how my poor Frederick hated the
race that had possessed itself of his estate. There
was nothing too bad for them. When he was excited

he would rave about them awfully  a beggarly
lawyer, a black-hearted scoundrel, that is what he
would call Lord Lord Sherrington, when he had
been drinking."

Theodore's brow grew thoughtful. How strange
this seemed, almost like a confirmation of Juanita's
superstitious horror of the banished race. Perhaps
it was not unnatural that an unlucky spendthrift 
ruined, disgraced  should hate the favourite of fortune
who had ousted him ; but not with a hate
capable of murder, murder in cold blood, the murder
of a man who had never injured him even indirectly.

Your husband has been dead some years, I
conclude ? " he said, presently.

Three years and a half on the tenth of last
month."

"And you had a troublesome time with him, I
fear?"

Trouble seems a light word for what I went
through. It was like living in hell  there is no
other word  the hell which a madman can make of
all around him. For a few weeks we went on quietly
he seemed contented, and I was very happy,

thinking I had cured him. I watched him as a cat
watches a mouse, for fear he should go wrong again.
He never went out without me ; and at home I did
all that a woman can do to make much of the man
she loves, studying him in everything, surrounding
him with every little luxury I could afford, cooking
dainty little meals for him, petting him as if he had
been an idolized child. He seemed grateful, for the
first few weeks, and almost happy. Then I saw he
was beginning to mope a little. He got low-spirited,
and would sit over the fire and brood  it was cutting
March weather  and would moan over his blighted
life, and his own folly. ' If I had to begin over
again,' he would say, ' ah, it would be different,
Cora, it would be all different.' "

** He was not unkind to you ? "

No, he was never unkind, never. To the last,
when he died raving mad with delirium tremens, he
was always kind. It was seeing his madness and
his ruin that made my trouble. He was violent
sometimes, and threatened to kill me, but that was
only when he didn't know me. I watched him
moping for a week or so, and then one day, I was

so unhappy at seeing him fret, that I thought I
would do anything to cheer him. I fancied he
missed the company in this house, and the cards
and dominoes, and billiards  for before we were
married he used to dine at the table d'hote two or
three times a week, and used to be in the cafe or in
the billiard room every night."

How did he manage to live without a profession,
and without ostensible means ? "

Madame shrugged her shoulders.

God knows. I think he used to write to his
old friends  his brother officers in the navy or the
merchant service  and he got a little from one and
a little from another. He would borrow of any one.
And there was a small legacy from his mother's
sister which fell in to him soon after he came to
Jersey. That was all gone before I married him.
He hadn't a penny after he'd paid the marriage fees.
Well, monsieur, seeing him so down-hearted I proposed
that he should go down to the * Belle Alliance '
and have a game at billiards and see his old friends.
You needn't take any money,' I said, ' my uncle
will treat you hospitably.' He seemed pleased at

the idea, and lie promised to be home early ; but
just as he was leaving the house he turned back and
said there was a little bill of thirty shillings he
owed to a boot maker in the street round the corner,
and he didn't like to pass the man's shop without
paying. Would I let him have the money ? It was
the first money he'd asked me for since we were
married, and I hadn't the heart to say no, so I went
to my little cash-box and took out three half
sovereigns. I told him that the money meant a
week's housekeeping. * I give you nice little
dinners, don't I, Fred ? ' I said, * but you've no idea
how economical I am.' He laughed and kissed me,
and said he hated economy, and wished he had a
fortune for my sake, and he went down the street
whistling. Well, sir, perhaps you can guess what
happened. He came home at three o'clock next
morning mad with drink, and then I knew he was
not to be cured. I went on trying all the same,
though, till the last ; and I lived the life of a soul
in torment. I was fond of him to the last, and saw
him killing himself inch by inch, and saw him die a
dreadful death, one year and three days after our

wedding day. He spent every penny I had in the
world, and my uncle helped us when that was
gone, and I came back to this house after his
funeral a broken-hearted woman. All my furniture
which I'd worked for was sold to pay the rent, and
the doctors, and the undertaker. I just saved the
furniture in this room, and that is all that is left of
four hundred and seventy pounds and of my married
Hfe."

** You were indeed the victim of a generous and
confiding heart."

I was fond of him to the last, monsieur, and I
forgave him all my sufferings ; but let no woman
ever marry a drunkard with the hope of reforming
him."

Were you quite alone in your martyrdom ; had
your husband no relatives left to help him on his
dying bed?"

"Not one. He told me he was the last of his
race. He must have had distant relations, I
suppose ; but his elder brother was dead, and his
sister."

You are sure his brother was dead ? "

Yes ; he fell into the water at Nice on a dark
evening, when he was going on board the steamer
for Corsica. I have got the paper with the account
of his death."

"Will you show me that paper, and any other
documents relating to your husband's family? I
know I have no right to ask such a favour ; but all
I can say is that I shall be very grateful if you
will so far oblige me."

The table cVhote was in full swing in the adjoining
room, as testified by the clattering of plates
and the jingle of knives and forks, and a subdued
murmur as of a good many confidential conversations
carried on simultaneously.

You want to see my poor Fred's private papers,"
said the widow, meditatively. " That's a good deal
to ask ; not that there are any secrets in them that
can hurt anybody above ground. The Colonel is
dead, and his sister. My husband was the last.
But I can't understand why anybody should want to
pry into a dead man's papers, unless there's property
hanging to them."

She looked at Theodore suspiciously, as if she

could not divest herself of the idea of a fortune
having turned up somehow, unexpectedly ; a fortune
to which her dead husband was entitled.

'* There is no property, I assure you. It is a
question of sentiment, not of money."

You're a lawyer, I suppose ? " said Coralieie, still
suspiciously.

She supposed that it was only lawyers who went
about prying into the affairs of the dead.

''I am a lawyer; but the business which brings
me to Jersey is not law business."

'well, I don't see how any harm can come to me
through your seeing my husband's papers. There's
not many to see  a few letters from the Colonel,
and two or three from a lawyer about the legacy,
and a dozen or so from old friends, refusing or sending
him money. You've spoken kindly to me, and
I've felt that you could sympathize with me, though
you're a stranger  so  well  you may see his letters,
though it hurts me to touch anything that belonged
to him, le pauvre hommes'"

She took a bunch of keys from her pocket, unlocked
the little secretaire, and from one of the

drawers produced a bundle of old letters and cuttings
from newspapers, which she handed to Theodore
Dalbrook, and then seated herself opposite to him,
planted her elbows on the table, and watched him
while he read, keenly on the alert for any revelation
of his purpose which might escape him in the
course of his reading. She had not altogether relinquished
that idea of an inheritance, or legacy 
property of some kind  involved in this endeavour
to trace a dead man's history. The explanation
which Theodore had given had not convinced her.
He had confessed himself a lawyer, and that was in
itself enough to make her doubt him.

The cuttings from old newspapers belonged to the
days when Frederick Strangway had commanded a
war ship, to the days when he fought in the Chinese
war. Some of them recorded the honour he had
won for himself at different stages of his career, and
it was only natural that these should have been
carefully preserved by him in all his wanderings.
But there were other cuttings  the report of the
court martial that broke him  the trial in which he
stood accused of having risked the loss of his ship

with all hands aboard by his dissolute habits  a
shameful and a painful story. This record of his
folly had been kept by that strange perversity of the
human mind which makes a man secrete and treasure
documents which must wring his heart and bow his
head with shame every time he looks at them.
There were other extracts of a like shameful kind
reports of street rows, two cases of drunken
assault in San Francisco, one of a fight in Sydney
harbour. He had kept them all as if they had been
words of praise and honour.

The letters were most of them trivial  letters
from brother officers of the past  " very sorry to
hear of your embarrassments," 'regret inability todo
more than the enclosed small cheque," " the
numerous claims upon my purse render it impossible
for me to grant the loan requested," the usual variations
upon the old tune in which a heavily-taxed
pater families fences vdth. the appeal of an unlucky
acquaintance. They were such letters as are left by
the portmanteau full among the effects of the man
for whom the world has been too hard.

Theodore put aside all this correspondence after a

VOL. I. X

brief glance, and there remained only four letters in
the same strong, resolute hand  the hands Reginald
Strangway.

The first in date was written on Army and Navy
Club paper, and was addressed to Captain Strangely,
Ren., H.M.S. Cobra, Hong Kong.

My dear Fred,

I have been sorry to leave your letter so
long unanswered, but I am bothered about a great
many things. My wife has been out of health for
nearly a year. The doctors fear her chest is
affected, and tell me I ought to get her away from
England before the winter. As things have been
going very badly with me for a long time I shall
not be sorry to cut this beastly town, where the
men who have made their money, God knows how,
are now upon the crest of the wave, and by their
reckless expenditure have made it impossible for a
man of small means to live in London  if he wants
to live like a gentleman. Everything is twice as
dear as it used to be when I was a subaltern. My
wife and I are pigging in two rooms on a second

floor in Jermyn Street. I live at my club, and she
lives on her relatives, so that we don't often have
to sit down to a lodging-house dinner of burnt soles
and greasy chops ; but the whole business is
wretched. She has to go to parties in a four-wheel
cab, and 1 can hardly afford the risk of a rubber.
So I shall be uncommonly glad to cut it all, and
settle in some out-of-the-way place where we can
live cheap, and where the climate will suit
Millicent.

My first idea was Algiers, but things are still
rather unsettled there, as you know. Langton, of
the Guards, has been shooting in Corsica lately,
and came home with a glowing account of the
climate and the cheapness of the inns, which are
roughish, but clean and fairly comfortable ; so I
have determined on Corsica. We shall be within
a day's sail of Nice, so not utterly out of reach of
civilisation, and we can live there how we like,
without entertaining a mortal, or having to buy new
clothes. Militant, who is fond of novelty, is in
love with the notion, and Dangerfield has behaved
very well to her, promising her an extra hundred a

X 2

year if we will live quietly and keep out of debt,
which, considering he is as poor as Job, is not so
bad. As for my creditors, they are pretty quiet
since I got Aunt Belle's legacy, part of which I
divided among 'em as a sop to Cerberus. They'll
have to be still quieter when I'm settled in Corsica.
Of course, you heard of that wretched woman's
kicking over the traces altogether at last. God
knows what will become of her. I believe she had
been carrying on rather badly for some time before
Tom found out anything. You know what an ass
he is. However, he got hold of a letter one evening
 met the postman at the door and took her
letters along with his own, and didn't like the look
of one and opened it; and then there was an
infernal row, and she just put on her bonnet and
shawl, walked out of the house and called a cab
and drove off. He followed in another cab, but it
was a foggy night, and he lost her before she'd gone
far. They were in lodgings in Essex Street, and it
isn't easy for one cab to chase another on a foggy
evening. She never went back to him, and he
went all over London denouncing her, naming first

one man and then another, but without any definite
idea as to who the real man was. The letter was
only a couple of sentences in Italian, which Tom
only knew by sight  but he could see it was an
appointment at a theatre, for the theatre and hour
were named. She snatched the letter out of his
hand while they were quarrelling, he told me, and
chucked it into the fire, so he hasn't even the
man's handwriting as evidence against him. It
was a hand he had never seen before, he says.
However, if he wants to find her no doubt he can
do so, if he takes the trouble. I am sorry she
should disgrace her family, and of course my wife
feels the scandal uncommonly hard upon her, I
can't say that I feel any pity for Tom Darcy. She
had led a wretched life with him ever since he sold
out, and I don't much wonder at her being deuced
glad to leave him. As it's Tom business to shoot
her lover, and not mine, I shan't mix myself up in
the affair  and as for her, well, she has made her

bed ! "

There was more in the letter, but the rest was of
no interest to Theodore.

The letter was dated January 3rd, 1851.

Three of the remaining letters were from Corsica,
and contained nothing of any significance. A
fourth was written at Monte Carlo, in answer to an
appeal for money, and the date was twelve years
later than the first. It was a gloomy letter, the
letter of a ruined man, who had drunk the cup of
disappointment to the dregs.

To ask me for help seems like a ghastly joke
on your part. Whatever your troubles may be, I
fancy my lookout is darker than yours. My wife
and I have vegetated on that accursed island for
just a dozen years  it seems like a lifetime to look
back upon. We just had enough to live upon while
my father was alive, for, bad as things were at
Cheriton, he contrived to send me something.
Now that he is gone, and the estate has been sold
by the mortgagees, there is nothing left for me
and we have been living for the last two years
upon the pittance my poor Silly gets from her
father. Whatever your cares may be, you don't
know what it is to have a sick wife whose condition
requires every luxury and indulgence, and to have

barely enough for bread and cheese. If you were
to see the house we live in  the tiled floors and the
dilapidated furniture  and the windows that won't
shut  and the shutters that won't keep to, and our
two Corsican servants who look like a brace of
savages, though they are good creatures in the
main  you would be the last man to howl about
your own troubles to me.

'*I have been here a month, and with my usual
diabolical luck. I am going home tomorrow 
though perhaps I should be wiser if I went up into
the hills behind Monaco and put a bullet through
my brains. Millicent would be no worse off", Grot
help her ; for she is entirely dependent on her
father, and I am only an incubus  but she might
think herself worse off, poor soul, so I suppose I had
better go home.

yhat am I thinking about? I can't aftbrd to
take refuge in the suicide's haven. My life is
insured in the Imperial for '3,000, and poor old
Dangerfield has been paying the premium ever since
I began to go to the bad financially. It would be
too hard upon him if I shot myself."

This was the last letter, and it was endorsed by
the brother's hand.

Eeginald's last letter. I read in the Times
newspaper of his being drowned at Nice ten days
afterwards."

Theodore made a note of the dates of these
letters, and the name of the insurance office.
Provided with these data it would be easy for him
to verify the fact of Colonel Strangway's death, and
thus bring the history of the two sons of old
Squire Strangway to its dismal close in dust and
darkness.

And thus would be answered Juanita's strange
suspicion of the house of Strangway, answered
with an unanswerable answer. Who can argue
with Death ? Is not that at least the end of all
things  the road that leads no whither?

There remained for him only the task of tracing
the erring daughter to her last resting-place. This
would doubtless be more difficult, as a runaway
wife living under a false name, and in all probability
going from place to place, was likely to

have left but faint and uncertain indications of her
existence. But the first part of his task had been
almost too easy. He felt that he could take no
credit for what he had done, could expect no
gratitude from Juanita.

He thanked Mrs. Strangwav  alias Madame
Coralieie  for her politeness, and asked to be allowed
to osier her a ten-pound note as a trifling acknowledgment
of the favour she had done him. She
promptly accepted this offering, and was only the
more convinced that there was " property " involved
in the lawyer's researches.

If there is anything to come to vie from any of
his relations, I hope nobody will try to keep me out
of it," she said. " I hope his friends will remember
that I gave him my last shilling, and nursed him
when there wasn't many would have stayed in the
room with him ? "

Theodore reiterated his assurance that no question
of money or inheritance was involved in his
mission to the Island, and then bade the Captain's
widow a respectful adieu, and threaded his way
through the avenue of tables to the door, and out of

the garlic-charged atmosphere into the fresh
autumnal air.
4 He stayed one night in Jersey, and left at
eleven o'clock the next morning on board the
Fanny, and slept in his chambers in Ferret
Court, after having written a long letter to
Juanita with a full account of all that he had
learnt from the lips of the widow, and from the
letters of the dead.

I do not surrender my hope of finding the
murderer," he wrote finally, " but you must now
agree with me that I must look elsewhere than
among the remnants of the Strangway race. They
can prove an unanswerable alibi  the grave."

He went to the office of the Imperial next
morning, saw the secretary, and ascertained that
the amount of the policy upon Colonel Strangway's
life had been paid to Lady Millicent Strangway, his
widow, in April, 1863, after the directors had received
indisputable evidence of his death.

I remember the case perfectly," said the secretary.
" The circumstances were peculiar, and there
Tas a suspicion of suicide, ns the man had just left

Monte Carlo, and was known to have lost his last
napoleon, after a most extraordinary run of luck.
There was some idea of disputing the claim ; but if
he did make away with himself he had contrived todo
it so cleverly that it would have been uncommonly
difficult to prove that his death was not
an accident  more particularly as Lord Danger field
brought an action against the steamboat company
for wilful negligence in regard to their gangway and
deficient lighting. The policy was an old one, too,
and so it was decided not to litigate."

There could be no doubt as to the identity
of the man who was drowned at Nice. I conclude?
"

No, the question of identity was carefully gone
into. Lord Dangerfield happened to be wintering
at Cannes that year, and he heard of his son-in-law's
death in time to go over and identify the body
before it was coffined. You know how quickly burial
follows death in that part of the world, and there
would have been no possibility of the widow getting
over from Ajaccio before the funeral. We had
Lord Dangerfield's declaration that the body he saw

at Nice was the body of Colonel Strangway, and we
paid the 3,000 on that evidence. We have
never had any reason to suspect error or foul
play."

CHAPTER I.

Thou takes not away, Death ?
Thou strikes  absence perished,
Indifference is no nitre ;
The future brightens on our sight ;
For on the past hath fallen a light
That tempts us to adore."

While Juanita clung with feverish intensity to
the hope of discovering her husband's murderer
Lord Cheriton seemed to be gradually resigning
himself to the idea that the crime would go to swell
the long list of undiscovered murders which he
could recall within his own experience of life 
crimes which had kept society expectant and on the
alert for a month, and which had stimulated the
police to unwonted exertions, finally to fade into
oblivion, or to be occasionally cited as an example
of the mysteriousness of human history.

VOL. II. B

He had offered a large reward, he had brought all
his own trained intelligence to bear upon the subject
; he had thought and brooded upon it by day
and by night ; and the result had been nil. A
hand had been stretched out of the darkness to slay
an unoffending young man, in whose life his daughter's
happiness had been bound up. That was the
whole history of the murder. A shot heard in the
night, a bullet fired out of the darkness with fatal
aim.

Not one indication, not one suggestive fact had
been discovered since the night of the murder.

It is hopeless," said Lord Cheriton, talking over
the calamity with Mr. Scarsdale, the Vicar of Cheriton
and Keswick, adjoining parishes; " the crime
and the motive of the crime are alike inscrutable.
If one could imagine a reason for the act it might
be easier to get upon the track of the murderer ;
but there is no reason that I can conceive for such a
deed. It has been suggested to me that Sir Godfrey
might have had a secret enemy  that his life
might not have been as spotless as we think "

I will answer for it that he was never guilty of
a dishonourable action, that he provoked no man's

hatred by any unworthy act," interrupted the Vicar
warmly.

He had been curate at Milbrook before he got the
Cheriton living, and had lived for two years at the
Priory while he prepared Godfrey Carmichael for
Eton, so he claimed the right to vouch for the
honour of the dead.

There never was a whiter soul in mortal clay,"
said the Vicar.

I am inclined to estimate his character almost
as highly as you," replied Lord Cheriton, deliberately,
"yet the straightest walker may make one
false step  and there may have been some unfortunate
entanglement at the University or in London
"

I will never believe it. He may have been
tempted  he may have yielded to temptation  but
if he erred, be sure he atoned for his error to the
uttermost of his power."

There are errors  seeming light to the steps
that stumble  which cannot be atoned for."

There was no such error in his youth. I
looked in his face on his wedding day, Lord Cheriton,
and it was the face of a man of unblemished

b 2

life  a man who need fear no ghost out of the dead
past."

Well, you are right, I believe  and in that case
the murder is motiveless  the murder of a madman
a madman so profoundly artful in his lunacy as to
escape every eye. By heaven, I wish we had the
old way of hunting such a quarry  and that a leash
of bloodhounds could have been set loose upon his
track within an hour of the murder. Tlwy would
have hunted him down  their instinct would have
found him skulking and shivering in his lair ; and
we should have needed no astute detective primed
with all the traditions of Scotland Yard. It would
have been swift, sudden justice  blood for blood."

His dark grey eyes shone with an angry light ashe
walked up and down the spacious floor of the
library, while the Vicar stood in front of the fire,
looking gravely into his clerical hat, and without
any suggestion to offer.

I hope Lady Carmichael is recovering her
spirits," he said feebly, after a pause.

She is not any happier than she was when her
loss was a week old ; but she keeps up in a wonderful
way. I believe she is sustained by some wild

notion that the murderer will be found  that she
will live to see her husband's death avenged. I doubt
if at present she has any other interest in life."

"But let us hope she will be cheered, by the
society of her husband's people. I hear that the
Morningsides and the Grenvilless are to be at the
Priory in November."

Indeed ! I have heard nothing about it."

I was at Swanage yesterday afternoon, and took
tea with Lady Jane. She was full of praises of
Lady Carmichael's goodness, and her desire that all
things at the Priory might be just as they had been
in Sir Godfrey's lifetime. His brothers-in-law used
to be invited for the shooting in November, and they
were to be invited this year, on condition that Lady
Jane would help to entertain them, and Lady Jane
has consented gladly. So there will be a large
family party at the Priory on this side of Christmas,"
concluded the Vicar.

I am glad to hear it," said Lord Cheriton.
Anything is better for her than solitude ; any
occupation, if it be only revising a bill of fare, or
listening to feminine twaddle, is better for her than
idleness."

"Yes, there will be a houseful," pursued the
Yicar ; " Mrs. Grenville takes her nursery with her
wherever she goes."

And Mrs. Morningside is delighted to leave
hers behind her."

Yes, she is one of those mothers who are
always telling people what paragons of nurses
Providence has provided for their darlings, or how
admirably their children are being brought up by a
model governess," said the Yicar, who was severe
upon other people's neglect of duty. " By the bye,
talking of mothers, I believe I saw Mrs. Porter's
daughter the other day while I was in town."

You believe you saw her ? "

"Yes, I am not certain. A face flashed past
me in the street one night, and when the face was
gone it came upon me that it was Mercy Porter's
eyes that looked at me for an instant in the gaslight.
I was in a busy thoroughfare on the Surrey side of
Westminster Bridge. I had been to hear Vansittart
preach a mission sermon at a church near Walworth,
and I was walking back to the West End. It was
late on a Saturday night, and the road was fall of
costermongers' barrows, and the pavement was

crowded with working people doing their marketing.
I tried to overtake the girl whose face had startled
me, but it was no use. She had melted into the
crowd. I went back the whole length of the street,
hoping I might find her in front of one of the costers'
stalls ; but she must have turned into one of the
numerous side streets, and it w T as hopeless to hunt
for her there. Yet I should have been very glad
to get hold of her."

Is she much changed ? "

Changed ! Yes. It was only the ghost of
Mercy Porter that I saw. I should not have known
her but for her eyes. She had fine eyes, do you
remember, and with a great deal of expression in
them. I think I should be safe in swearing to
Mercy Porter's eyes."

Did she look poor or ill ? "

She looked both  but the illness might be only
hunger. She had that wan pinched look one sees in
the faces of the London poor, especially in the
women's faces."

Have you told her mother ? "

No, I came to the conclusion that it would be
giving the poor soul useless pain to tell her anything,

having so little to tell. She knew years ago
that Colonel Tremaine had deserted his victim, and
that the girl had dropped through. God knows where :
into the abyss that swallows up handsome young
women who begin their career in West End lodgings
and a hired brougham. If the mother were to go inquest
of her, and bring her home here, it might be
only to bring shame and misery upon her declining
years. The creature may have fallen too low for the
possibility of reformation, and the mother's last
hours might be darkened by her sin. I would do
much to rescue her  but I would rather try to save
her through a stranger's help than by the mother's
intervention."

Lord Cheriton continued his pacing to and fro,
and did not appear particularly interested in the case
of Mercy Porter. He had been much troubled by
her flight from Cheriton, for the seducer was his own
familiar friend, and he had felt himself in sometime
to blame for having brought such a man to Cheriton.
He told himself that he would not have had Remain
inside his house had his own daughter been
out of the schoolroom ; and yet he had allowed the
man to cross the path of the widow's only child, and

to bring desolation and sorrow upon the woman
whose life he had in sometime taken under his protection.


There are people whose mission it is to hunt out
that kind of misery," he said, after an interval of
silence. " I hope one of those good women will
rescue Mercy Porter. I think you have been wise in
saying nothing to the mother. She has got over
her trouble, and anything she might hear about the
girl would only be a reopening of old wounds."

She is a wonderful woman," replied the vicar ;
 I never saw such grief as hers when the girl ran
away ; and yet within a few months she had calmed
down into the placid personage she has been ever
since. She is a woman of very powerful mind. I
sometimes wonder that even at her age she can content
herself with the monotonous life she leads in
that cottage."

Oh, she likes the place, I believe, and the life
suits her," said Lord Cheriton, carelessly. " She
had seen a good deal of trouble before she came
here, and this was a quiet haven for her after the
storms of life. I am very sorry the daughter went
wrong," he added, with a sudden cloud upon his

face. " That was a bitter blow; and I shall never
forgive myself for having brought that scoundrel
Tremaine here."

He is dead, is he not ? "

Yes, he was killed in Afghanistan six years ago.
He was a good soldier though he was a bad man. I
daresay he made his being ordered off to India an
excuse for leaving Mercy  left her with a trifle of
money perhaps, and a promise of further remittances,
and then let her drift. I told my lawyer to
keep his eye upon her, if possible, and to establish
her in some respectable calling if ever he saw the
chance of doing so ; but she eluded him somehow,
as you know."

Yes, you told me what you had done. It was
like you to think even of so remote a claim upon
your generosity."

Oh, she belonged to Cheriton. I have cultivated
the patriarchal feeling as much as I can. All
who live upon my land are under my protection."


Lady Cheriton has been a good friend to Mrs.
Porter too."

My wife is always kind."

Juanita accepted her cousin's account of what he
had heard and read at St. Sellers, as the closing
of his researches in the history of the Strangways.
The sister's death in a shabby exile remained to be
traced ; but there was no light to be expected there ;
and Juanita felt that she must now submit to surrender
her superstition about that evil race. It was
not from them the blow had come. The murderer
had to be hunted for in a wider range, and the quest
would be more difficult than she had thought. She
was not the less intent upon discovery because of
this difficulty.

I have all my life before me," she told herself,
and I have nothing to live for but to see his
murderer punished."

It had been Juanita's especial desire that the
Morningsides and the Grenvilless should be invited
to the Priory just as they had been in Sir Godfrey's
lifetime  that all the habits of the household should
be as he had willed them when his bodily presence
was there among them, as he was now in the spirit,
to Juanita's imagination. She thought of him
every hour of the day, and in all things deferred to
his opinions and ideas, shaping the whole course of

her life to please him who was lying in that dark
resting-place where there is neither pain nor
pleasure.

When November came, however, and with it the
troop of Grenvilless, nurses and nursery governess,
and the Morningsides with valet and maid, it seemed
to Juanita as if the wild companions of Comus or a
contingent from Bedlam had invaded the sober old
Priory. Those loud voices in the hall, that perpetual
running up and down and talking and laughing
upon the staircase ; the everlasting opening and
shutting of doors ; the roll of carriage wheels
driving up to the door a dozen times in a day ; the
bustle and fuss and commotion which two cheerful
families in rude health can contrive to make in a
house where they feel themselves perfectly at home 
all these things were agonizing to the mourner who
had lived in silence and shadow from the hour of her
loss until now. Happily, however, Lady Jane was
there to take all the burden ois those weary shoulders
; and Lady Jane in the character of a grandmother
was in her very fittest sphere. Between her
ladyship and the housekeeper all arrangements
w T ere made, and every detail was attended to

without inflicting the slightest trouble upon
Juanita.

You shall see just as little of them all as you
like, dear," said Lady Jane. " You can breakfast and
lunch in your morning room, and just come down
to dinner when you feel equal to being with us, and
then you will see the darlings at dessert. I know
they will cheer you, with their pretty little ways.
Such loving pets as they are too, and so full of intelligence.
Did I tell you what Johnnie said yesterday
at lunch ? "

Yes, dear Lady Jane, you did tell me. It was
very funny," replied Juanita, with a faint smile.

She could not tell that adoring grandmother that
the children were a burden to her, and that those
intelligent speeches and delightful mispronunciations
of polysyllabic words which convulsed parents and
transparent seemed to add perceptibly to her own
gloom. She pretended to be interested in Tom's
letter from Eton with a modest request for a large
hamper, and she made a martyr of herself by showing
Susie picture-books, and explaining the pictures,
or by telling Lucy her favourite Hans Andersen
story, which never palled upon that young listener.

Don't you think you would like a new one ? "
Juanita would ask.

"No, no, not a new one  the same, please. I
want ' The Proud Darning Needle.' "

So the adventures of " The Proud Darning
Needle " had to be read or related as the case might
be.

Juanita took Lady Jane's advice and spent the
greater part of every day in her morning-room, that
room which had been Godfrey's den. It was further
from the staircase than any other sitting-room, and
the clatter and the shrill voices were somewhat
modified by distance. The house-party amused
themselves after their hearts' desire, and worked the
horses with the true metropolitan feeling that a
horse is an animal designed for locomotion, and that
he can't have too much of it. Lady Jane was the
most indulgent of deputy hostesses, and spent all
breakfast time in cutting sandwiches of a particularly
dainty kind for her sons-in-law, so that they might
be sustained between the luxurious home breakfast
at nine, and the copious luncheon with which the
cart met the shooters by appointment at half-past
one. When the shooters had started there were the

little Grenvilless to slave for ; and Lady Jane spent
another half-hour in seeing them off upon their
morning constitutional, Lucy on her Shetland, and
Johnnie, Susie, and Godolphin on their short little
legs, with groom and nurses in attendance. There
were so many wraps to be adjusted, so many injunctions
to be given to nurses and groom, so many
little pockets to be filled with gingerbread and
queen-cakes, while Mrs. Grenville looked on, and
protested against grand mamma's infraction of
hygienic rules. Dr. Dobson Drooce had said they
must never eat between meals.

Juanita rarely appeared before afternoon tea,
when she was generally installed in her own particular
easy chair by the fire, fenced round by a
seven-leaved Indian screen, which was big enough
to include a couple of small tables and a creepie
stool, before the sisters-in-law came in from their
afternoon drive, or the shooters dropped in after their
day in the woods. There were no other guests than
the sisters and their husbands ; and it was an
understood thing that no one else should be asked,
unless it were Lord and Lady Cheriton, the Dal-brooks
from Dorchester, or Mr. Scarsdale.

No one could have been sweeter than the young
widow was to her visitors during the hours she spent
with them, listening with inexhaustible patience to
Jessica Grenville's graphic account of the measles as
lately " taken " by her whole brood, with all the
after consequences of the malady, and the amount of
cod-liver oil and quinine consumed by each patient ;
pretending to be interested in Ruth Morningside's
perpetual disquisitions upon smart people and smart
people's frocks ; and in every way performing her
duty as a hostess.

And yet George Grenville was not altogether
satisfied.

I'll tell you what it is, Jess," he said to his
wife one night, in the luxurious privacy of the good
old-fashioned bedroom, seated on the capacious sofa
in front of the monumental four-poster, with labors
columns, richly-moulded cornice, and
heavy damask curtains ; the kind of bedstead for
which our ancestors gave fifty guineas, and for
which no modern auctioneer can obtain a bid
of fifty shillings; "I'll tell you what it is,
Jess," repeated Mr. Grenville, frowning at the
fire, " either your brother's widow gives herself

confounded airs, or there is something in the
wind."

I'm afraid so, George," replied his wife, meekly.

You're afraid of what ? Why the deuce can't
you be coherent? Afraid of her airs "

"I'm afraid there is  something in the wind,"
faltered the submissive lady. "I suppose it's the
best thing that could happen to her, poor girl, for a
nursery will be an occupation for her mind, and prevent
her brooding on her loss ; but this place would
have been very nice for Tom all the same."

I should think it would indeed, and he ought
not to be swindled out of it," said Mr. Grenville,
with a disgusted air. " I  I am surprised at your
sister-in-law ! I have always considered that there
is a kind of indelicacy in a posthumous child. It
may be a prejudice on my part, but I have always
felt a sort of revulsion when I have heard of such
creatures," and Mr. Grenville curled his lordly
aquiline nose, and made a wry face at the jovial fire,
blazing hospitably, heaped high with coals and wood,
and roaring up towards the frosty sky.

VOL. II.

Then through my brain the thought did pass,
Even as a flash of lightning there,
That there was something in her air,
"Which would not doom me to despair ;
And on the thought my words broke forth."

Harrington Dalbrook was as keenly impressed
with a sense of stupendous self-sacrifice in giving up
his prospects in the Church as if the Primacy had
only been a question of time ; yet as his Divinity
examination had twice ended in disappointment and
-a shame-faced return to the paternal roof-tree, it
might be thought that, in his friend Sir Henry Baldwin's
phraseology, he was very well out of it. Sir
Henry was the average young man of the epoch,
sharp, shallow, and with a strong belief in his own
superiority to the human race in general, and
naturally to a friend whose father plodded over
leases and agreements in an old-fashioned office in a
country town ; but the two young men happened to
have been thrown together at Oxford, where Sir Henry

was at Christ Church while Harrington Dalbrook
was at New; and as Sir Henry's ancestral home was
within six miles of Dorchester, the friendship begun
at the University was continued in the county town.
Sir Henry lived at a good old Georgian house
called the Mount, between Dorchester and "Weymouth.
It was a red brick house, with a centre and
two wings, a Corinthian portico of Portland stone,
and a wide level lawn in front of the portico, that
was brilliant with scarlet geraniums all the summer.
There were no novelties in the way of gardening at
the Mount, and there were never likely to be any
new departures while Lady Baldwin held the reins
of power. She was known in the locality as a lady
of remarkable " closeness," a lady who pared down
every department of expenditure to the very bone.
The gardens and shrubberies were always in perfect
order, neat, trim, weedless ; but everything was
reduced to the minimum of outlay ; there were no
new plants or shrubs, no specimen trees, no innovations
or improvements ; there was very little " glass,"
and there were only two gardeners to do the work in
grounds for which most people would have kept four
or five.

c 2

The dowager was never ashamed to allude to the
smallness of her jointure or to bemoan her son's
college debts. She had two daughters, the younger
pale, sickly, and insignificant; the elder tall and
large, with a beauty of the showy and highly-coloured
order, brown eyes, a complexion of milk and roses,
freely sprinkled with freckles, and light wavy hair,
which in a young woman of meaner station might
have been called red.

The neighbourhood was of opinion that it was
time for the elder Miss Baldwin to marry, and that
she ought to marry well ; but that important factor
in marriage, the bridegroom, was not forthcoming.
It was a ground of complaint against Sir Henry
that he never brought any eligible young men to the
Mount.

"My mother's housekeeping would frighten them
away if I did," answered Henry, when hard driven
upon this point. " The young men of the present
day like a good dinner. There isn't a third-rate
club in London where the half-crown house dinner
isn't better than the food we have here  better
cooked and more plentiful."

Perhaps, if you helped mother a little things

would be more comfortable than they are," remonstrated
Laura, the younger sister, who generally
took upon herself the part of Mentor. 'you must
know that her income isn't enough to keep up this
place as it ought to be kept."

I don't know anything of the kind. I believe
she is hoarding and scraping for you two girls ; bat
she'll find by and by that she has been penny wise
and pound foolish, for nobody worth having will ever
propose to Juliet in such a dismal hole as this," continued
the baronet, scornfully surveying the old-fashioned
furniture, which had never been vivified
by modern frivolities, or made more luxurious by
modern inventions.

Juliet is not the beginning and end of our lives,"
replied Laura, sourly. " She has plenty of opportunities,
if she were only capable of using them. I
know her visiting costs a small fortune."

A very small one," said Juliet, "I have fewer
gowns than any girl I meet, and have to give smaller
tips when I am leaving. The servants are hardly
civil to me when I go back to a house."

I daresay not," retorted Laura, " considering
that you expect other people's maids to do more for

you than your own maid would do, if you had
one."

Juliet sighed, and shrugged her graceful
shoulders.

It is all very horrid and very sordid," she said,
and I wish I were dead."

"I don't go so far as that," replied Laura,
"but I wish with all my heart you were married,
and that mother and I could live in peace."

All this meant that the handsome Miss Baldwin
was seventy-and-twenty, and that although she had
drunk the cup of praise from men and women, not
one eligible man with place and fortune to offer had
offered himself. Eligible men had admired and had
praised and had flattered, and had ridden away, like
the knight of old, and had married some other girl ;
a girl with money generally, an American girl sometimes.
Juliet Baldwin hated the very name of
Columbus.

For want of some one better to flirt with, Juliet
had flirted with Harrington Dalbrook. He was her
junior by two years, and on his first visit to the
Mount had succumbed to her beauty, and to the
charm of manners which somewhat exaggerated the

progressive spirit of the smart world. Miss Baldwin
was amused by her conquest, though she had no
idea of allowing her acquaintance with her brother's
friend to travel beyond the strictest limits of that
state of things which our neighbours call " flirtage."
But "flirtage" now-a-days is somewhat comprehensive
; and with Juliet it went so far as to allow
her admirer to gratify her with offerings of gloves
and flowers for her ball-dresses, when she was staying
with friends in Belgravia, and the young man was
taking a holiday in London.

It may be that the fascinations of this young lady
had something to do with Harrington's failure to pass
his Divinity examination, and with his subsequent
renunciation of the Church of England for the
wider faith of the naturalist and the metaphysician.
He told his family that he had got beyond Christianity
as it was understood by Churchmen, and set
forth in the Thirty-nine Articles. He had gone from
the river to the sea, as he explained it, from the
narrow banked-in river of orthodoxy to the wide
ocean of the new faith  faith in humanity  faith ina
universal brotherhood  faith in one's self as
superior to anything else in the universe, past or

present. In this enlightened attitude he had grasped
at Theodore's offer, all the more eagerly, perhaps,
because he had lately heard Juliet Baldwin's emphatic
declaration apropos to nothing particular  that she
would never marry a parson, and that the existence
of a parson's wife in town or country seemed to her
of all lives the most odious.

Would she take more kindly to a lawyer, he asked
himself with a sinking heart. Would a country
practice, life in an old-fashioned house in an old-fashioned
market-town, satisfy her ambition ? He
feared not. If he wanted that radiant creature for
his wife, he must exchange country for town, Dorchester
for Lincoln's Inn Fields, and a house in
Chester Street, or at least Gloucester Place. She
had been used to Belgravia ; but she might perhaps
tolerate the neighbourhood of Portman Square, the
aristocratic sound of Baker Street, the convenience
of Atlas omnibuses, until he should be able to
start his brougham.

Led on by this guiding star he told himself that
what he had to do was to become learned in the law,
particularly in the science, art, and mystery of conveyancing,
which branch of a family practice he

believed to be at once dignified and lucrative. He
had to make himself master of his profession, to
make his experiments upon the inferior clay of
Dorsetshire  upon farmers and small gentry  and
then to persuade his father to buy him a London
practice, an aristocratic London practice, such as
should not call a blush to the cheek of a fashionable
wife. He had met solicitors' wives who gave themselves
all the airs of great ladies, and who talked as
if the Bench and the Bar were set in motion and
kept going by their husbands. Such a wife would
Juliet be could he be so blessed as to win her.

The mild "flirtage," involving much tribute from
the glover and the florist, the bookseller and the
photographer, had been going on for nearly three
years, and Harrington was tremendously in earnest.
His sisters had encouraged him in his infatuation,
thinking that it would be rather a nice thing to have
a baronet as a family connection, and with a sneaking
admiration for Sir Henry Baldwin's club-house
manners, and slangy vocabulary, which had to be
translated to them in the first instance by Harrington.
They liked to be intimate with Miss Baldwin
of the Mount, liked to see her smart little pony-cart

waiting for an hour in front of the door in Cornhill,
while the young lady prattled about her conquests,
her frocks, and her parties, over the afternoon tea-table.
True that she never talked about anybody
but herself, except when she depreciated a rival
belle ; but the background of her talk was the
smart world, and that was a world of which Janet
and her sister loved to hear, albeit " plain-living
and high-thinking" was their motto.

Sir Henry had a small hunting stud, and somewhat
ungraciously allowed his elder sister an occasional
mount, although, as he took care to impress
upon her, he hated hunting women. For the
pleasure of being in the young lady's society
Harrington, who had no passion for horsemanship,
became all of a sudden an ardent sportsman,
borrowed his brother's cob, Peter, and was ultimately
cajoled into the purchase of an elderly
hunter, which was not quite quick enough for his
friend Sir Henry.

"You don't mean hunting in the shires, so pace
is not of so much consequence to you as it is to me,"
said the baronet. " Mahmud will carry you beautifully
in our country, and he's as quiet as a sheep."

It is possible that this qualification of sheepishness
was Mahrnud's chief merit in Harrington's
estimation. He was a black horse, and looked a
good deal for the money. Sir Henry asked a hundred
guineas for him, and finally took his friend's
acceptance for eighty, and this transaction was the
first burden of debt which Harrington Dalbrook
laid upon his shoulders after leaving the University.
There had been college debts, and he had considerably
exceeded a very liberal allowance, but his
father had paid those debts to the las!: shilling ;
and one grave and stern remonstrance, with a few
fatherly words of advice for the future, had been all
that Harrington had been called upon to endure.
But he did not forget that his father had warned
him against the consequences of any future folly.

He felt rather uncomfortable when the black
horse was brought to the door one hunting morning,
and when his father happened to be in the front
office, whence he could see the unknown animal.

Where did you get that black horse, Harrington
? Is it a hire ? " he asked.

No. The fact is I've bought him."

Have you really ? You must be richer than I

gave you credit for being if you can afford to buy
yourself a hunter. He looks a well-bred one, but
shows work. I hope you didn't give much for
him.'

"No; I got him on easy terms."

Not on credit, I hope."

No ; of course not. Sir Henry Baldwin sold
him to me. I had saved a little out of my allowance,
don't you know ? "

I'm very glad to hear it. And now be off and
get a good day's sport, if you can. I shall want you
to stick to your desk tomorrow."

Harrington took up his crop and hurried outwith
a heart as heavy as lead. Never until to-day
had he told his father a deliberate falsehood ; but
Matthew Dalbrook's searching look had frightened
him out of his veracity. Only six months ago he
had solemnly pledged himself to avoid debt, and he
had broken his promise already, and owed eighty
guineas for a beast which he could hardly hope to
ride to hounds half-a-dozen times that season. He
had involved himself for the beast's maintenance
also, for his father's stables were full, and he had
been obliged to put this new animal out at livery.

He began to feel now that he had made a fool of
himself; that he had been talked into buying a
horse for which he had very little use.

He was jogging along in a low-spirited way when
Sir Henry and his sister came up behind him at a
sharp trot, whereat Mahmud gave a buck-jump that
almost unseated him.

M The black looks a trifle fresh this morning,' '
said Sir Henry. " You'll take it out of him presently.
He suits you capitally, and he's well up to
your weight. I was a little bit too heavy for him.
You'll find him go like old boots."

Miss Baldwin, flushed with fresh air and exercise,
looked more than usually brilliant. She was particularly
amiable too ; and when Harrington complained
that he might not be able to give Mahmud
enough work she offered to meet the difficulty.

Send him over to me whenever you don't want
him," she said, cheerily. "I'll make him handy
for you."

The black gave another buck-jump, and Harrington
felt inclined to lay him at her feet there and
then. It was only the remembrance of that horrid
slip of stamped paper, which had doubtless already

been turned into cash by Sir Henry, which restrained
him. He made up his mind to send
Mahmud to Tattersall's at the end of the hunting
season, to be sold without reserve. Juliet was
riding a thorough-bred of which she was particularly
fond, and was in very high spirits during the
earlier part of the day; and in her lively society
Harrington forgot the stamped paper, and gradually
got on good terms with his horse. Mahmud had,
indeed, no fault but age. He knew a great deal
better how to keep near the hounds than his new
master, and promised.to be a valuable acquisition.

Harrington felt that he was distinguishing
himself.

"The black suits you down to the ground,"
shouted Sir Henry, in the middle of a run, as he
bucket past his friend upon a pulling chestnut
that had no respect for anybody, but clove his way
through the ruck of riders like a battering-ram.

Sir Henry boasted of this animal that he never
kicked a hound.

Small thanks to him," said the Master, " for he
kicks everything else. Hounds are not good enough
for him. He nearly smashed my leg last Monday."

Harrington and Juliet did a good deal of quiet
flirtation while the hounds were drawing a spinney
rather late in the day, after a very good run and a
kill. He told her all about the change in his
position, and that he was to be his father's partner
after a very short apprenticeship to the law.

"And you will live in Dorchester all sour life,"
said Juliet, with an involuntary disgust.

Not if I can help it. I don't mean to vegetate
in a dead-alive provincial town. My father has a
London connection already, and all his business
wants is a little new blood. I hope to start
chambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields before I am many
years older. And if I should marry," he continued,
faltering a little, " I could afford to have a house
in the West End  May Fair or Belgravia, for
instance."

Let it be May Fair, I beg  for your wife's sake,
whoever she may be," exclaimed Juliet lightly.
"A small house in Belgravia is an abomination.
There is an atmosphere of invincible dreariness
throughout that district which can only be redeemed
by wealth and splendour. Perhaps it is
because the place is on a level with Millbank.

There is a flavour of the prison in the very air.
Now, in Curzon or Hertford Street one breathes the
air of the Park and Piccadilly, and one could exist
in a bandbox. But really now, Harrington, joking
apart, is it not rather wild in a young man like you
not out of paternal leading-strings  to talk about
marriage and housekeeping ? "

One can't help thinking of the future. Besides,
I am not so very young. I am four-and-twenty."

Juliet laughed a short cynical laugh, which ended
in a sigh. She wondered whether he knew that she
was three years older. Brothers are such traitors.

"lam four-and-twenty, and I feel that it is in
me to succeed," concluded Harrington, with a comfortable
vanity which he mistook for the self-confidence
of genius.

The hounds drew blank, and the riders jogged
homewards presently, by lane and common, Sir
Henry keeping in front with one of his particular
friends, and talking horse-flesh all the way, while
Juliet and Harrington followed slowly side by side
in earnest conversation.

He told her the history of his doubts, about
which she did net care twopence  his " phases of

faith and feeling," as he expressed it alliterative.
All she wanted to know was about his prospects 
whether his father was as well off as he was said to
be  she had heard people talk of him as a very rich
man  those officious people who are always calculating
other people's incomes, and descanting upon
the little their neighbours spend, and the much that
they must contrive to save. Juliet had heard a
good deal of this kind of talk about Matthew
Dalbrook, whose unpretentious and somewhat old-fashioned
style of living gave an impression of
reserved force  wealth invested and accumulating
for a smarter generation. After all, perhaps, this
young man, whose adoration was obvious, might
not be a despicable parti. He might be pretty well
off by-and-by, with a fourth, or better than a fourth,
share of Matthew Dalbrook's scrapings  and he was
Lord Cheriton's cousin, and therefore could hardly
be called a nobody.

Moved by these considerations, gravely weighed
in the grave and grey November dusk, as they rode
slowly between tall hedges, leafy still, but sear and
red with the frost, Juliet felt inclined to let herself
be engaged to her legal lover. She had been engaged

VOL. II. d

to several people since she danced at her first ball.
The bond did not count for very much in her mind.
One could always slip out of that kind of thing, if
it became inconvenient  one could manage with
such tact that the man himself cried off, if one were
afraid of being denounced as a jilt. Juliet and her
lovers had always parted friends ; and she wore more
than one half-hoop of sapphires or of brilliant
which had once played a solemn part as her engagement
ring, but which had lapsed into a souvenir of
friendship.

She was not so foolish as to hasten matters. She
wanted to see her way before her ; and she opposed
Harrington's youthful ardour with the calm savoir-faire
of seven-and-t wen ty. She called him a foolish
boy, and declared that they must cease to be friends
if he insisted upon talking nonsense. She would
have to accept a very urgent invitation to Lady
Balcony Bring's Castle in Scotland, which
she had been fencing with for years, if he
made it difficult for them to meet. She threw
him into a state of abject alarm by this stupendous
threat.

I won't say a word you can take objection to,"

he protested, " though I can't think why you should
object."

"You forget that I have to study other people's
ideas as well as my own," she answered gently.
I hope you won't be offended if I tell you that ruy
mother would never speak to me again if I were
engaged to you."

No doubt Lady Baldwin has higher views," the
young man said meekly.

Much higher views. My poor mother belongs
to the old school. She cannot forget that her grandfather
was a marquis. It is foolish, but I suppose
it is human nature. Don't let us talk any more
about this nonsense. I like you very much as
my brother's friend, and I shall go on liking
you if you don't make me unhappy by talking nonsense."


Harrington took comfort from that one word " unhappy."
It implied depths of feeling beneath that
fashionable manner which held him at arm's length.

His spirits were somewhat dashed presently when
Miss Baldwin looked with friendly contemptuousness
at his neat heather-mixture coat and mud-stained
white cords, and said carelessly, 

d 2

"It's a pity you don't belong to the Hunt. I
fancy you would look rather nice in pink ! "

"I  I  have so lately given up the idea of the
Church," he faltered.

Yes, but now you have given it up, you ought to
be a member of the Hunt. Let my brother put you
up at the next meeting. You are pretty sure of
being elected, and then you can order your pink
swallow-tail coat in time for the Hunt Ball in
December."

Harrington shivered. That would mean two redcoats
 a hunting coat and a dancing coat. But this
idea of twenty pounds laid out upon coats was not
the worst. Twenty years ago, when he had ridden
as hard and kept as good horses as any member of
the Hunt, Matthew Dalbrook had resolutely declined
the honour of membership. He had considered
that a provincial solicitor had other work than to
ride to hounds twice or three times a week. He
might allow himself that pleasure now and again as
an occasional relaxation in a hard-working professional
life ; but it was not for him to spend long days
tearing about the country with the men of whose
lands and interests he was in some wise custodian.

Theodore, who was at heart much more of a
sportsman than his younger brother, had respected
his father's old-fashioned prejudices, whatever line
they took, and he had never allowed his name to be
put up for the Hunt. He had subscribed liberally
to the fund for contingent expenses, as his father
and grandfather had done before him ; but he had
been content to forego the glory of a scarlet coat,
and the privilege of the Hunt buttons.

Harrington was not strong in that chief virtue of
man, moral courage  the modern and loftier equivalent
for that brute-courage which was the Woman's
only idea of virtue. He felt that to acknowledge
himself afraid to put up for election into the sacred
circle of the Hunt lest he should offend his father,
was to own by implication that a solicitor was not
quite upon the social level of landed gentry and
retired military men, the colonels and majors who
form the chief ornament of the average Hunt
club.

He murmured something to the effect that his
father was not sporting, and wouldn't like him tow
r aste too much time riding to hounds.

"What does that matter 9 " exclaimed Juliet.

You needn't go out any oftener because you are a
member of the Hunt. There are men who appear
scarcely half-a-dozen times in a season  men who
have left the neighbourhood, and only come down
for a run now and then for old sake's sake."

I'll think it over," faltered Harrington. " Don't
say anything to Sir Henry about it just yet."

As you please ; but I shan't dance with you at
the ball if you wear a black coat," said Juliet, giving
her bridle a sharp little shake and trotting forward
to join her brother.

Mahmud, discomposed by that sudden start, gave
a shambling elderly shy ; Harrington pulled him up
into a walk, and rode sulkily on, and allowed the
other three riders to melt from him in the shades of
evening.

Yes, she was beautiful exceedingly, and it would be
promotion for a country solicitor to be engaged to a girl
of such high standing ; but he felt that his relations
with her were hedged round with difficulty. She was
expensive herself, and a cause of expense in others.
She had spent the brightest years of her girlhood in
visiting in country houses, where everything was on
a grander scale than at the Mount. She had escaped

from the barrenness of home to the mansions of
noblemen and millionaires. She had strained all
her energies towards one aim  to be popular, and
to be asked to good houses. She had run the gauntlet
of most of the best smoke-rooms in the three
kingdoms, and had been talked about everywhere as
the handsome Miss Baldwin. Yet her twenty-seventh
birthday had sounded, and she was Miss
Baldwin still. Half-a-dozen times she had fancied
herself upon the eve of a great success  such a
marriage as would at once exalt her to the pinnacle
of social distinction  and at the last moment, as it
seemed, the man had changed his mind. Some
malicious mother of ugly daughters, or disappointed
spinster, had told the eligible suitor " things" about
Miss Baldwin  harmless little deviations from the
rigid lines of maidenly etiquette, and the suitor had
cried off, fearing in his own succinct speech that he
was going to be " had."

At seven-and-twenty, damaged by the reputation
of failure  spoken of by the initiated as " that handsome
girl Maltravers so nearly married, don't you
know ? "  Miss Baldwin felt that all hope of a great
match was over. The funeral bell of ambition

had tolled. She began to grow reckless ; eat her
dinner and took her dry champagne with a masculine
gusto ; smoked as many cigarettes as a secretary of
legation ; read all the new French novels, and talked
about them unreservedly with her partners ; was keen
upon racing, and loved euchre and nap. She had
half made up her mind to throw herself away upon the
first wealthy cotton-spinner she might meet up in
the North when she allowed herself to be touched by
Harrington Dalbrook's somewhat boyish devotion,
and began to wonder whether it might not be well
for her to end her chequered career by a love match.
He was good-looking, much better educated than
her brother and her brother's set, and he adored her.
But on the other hand he was utterly without any
claims to be considered " smart," and marriage with
him would mean at best bread and cheese  or would
at least mean nothing better than bread and cheese
until they should both be middle-aged, and she
should have lost all semblance of a waist. She had
met solicitors' wives in society who wore diamonds,
and who hurried away from evening parties because
they were afraid of their horses catching cold  a
carefulness which to her mind implied that horses

were a novelty. Sh had even heard of solicitors
making whig fortunes ; but she concluded that those
were exceptional men, and she did not see in Harrington's
character the potentiality of wealth beyond
the dreams of avarice.

Moved by these mixed feelings she allowed her
lover to dangle in a state of uncertainty, and to spend
all his spare cash upon those airy nothings which a
young lady of Miss Baldwin's easy temper will accept
from even a casual admirer. He knew the glover
whose gloves she approved, and she occasionally told
him the colour of a gown in advance, so that he
might give her a suitable fan ; and she had, furthermore,
an off-hand way of mentioning any songs or
new French novels she fancied.

How very sweet of you'' she would say, when
the songs or the books appeared, " but it is really
too bad  I must never mention anything I want in
your hearing."

In spite of which wise remark the volatile damsel
went on mentioning things, and being surprised
when her wishes were gratified.

Miss Baldwin had met Lady Cheriton and her

daughter both in town and country, and she and
her people had been invited to garden parties at
Cheriton Chase, but there had been no intimacy
between the families. Lady Cheriton shrank with
an inward terror from a young lady of such
advanced opinions as those which dropped like
pearls and diamonds  or like toads and adders 
according to the idea of her hearers  from Miss
Baldwin's lips. Rumours of the young man's
infatuation had been conveyed to the Priory by Lady
Jane, and Harrington having gone to a family
dinner at Milbrook was severely interrogated by his
cousin.

I hope there is no truth in what I have heard
about you, Harry," she said confidentially, when hew
7 as sitting by her in her favourite corner within the
shadow of the tall screen.

"I cannot answer that question until you tell me
what you have heard," he replied with offended
dignity.

Something that would make me very unhappy
if it were true. I was told you were getting
entangled with that Miss Baldwin."

"I don't know why you should lay such an offensive

emphasis upon the demonstrative pronoun.
Miss Baldwin is beautiful and accomplished  and 
I am very proud of being attached to her."

"Has it gone so far as that, Harry? Are you
actually engaged to her ? "

"lam not actually engaged  she has a right to
look a good deal higher  but I hope to make her
my wife as soon as I am in a position to marry.
She has given me so much encouragement that I
don't think she will refuse me when the right time
comes."

"But, my dear boy, she is always giving
encouragement," exclaimed Juanita, anxiously.

Dear little Lucy Grenville w 7 as at the piano at the
other end of the room playing an infantile arrangement
of " Batt, batt," with fingers of iron, while
mother and grandmother hung over her enraptured,
and while the rest of the family party talked their
loudest, so the cousins in the nook by the fire were
not afraid of being overheard. " She is the most
encouraging young lady I ever heard of. She has
jilted and been jilted a dozen times, I believe "

"You believe" echoed Harrington, with intense
indignation; "I wonder that a girl of your good

sense  in most things  can give heed to such idle
gossip."

"Do you mean to say that she has not been
jilted?"

Certainly not. I admit that her name has been
associated with the names of men in society. Silly
people who write for the papers have given out things
about her. She was to marry Lord Warbeck, Sir
Humphrey Random  Heaven knows whom. A
girl can't stay at big houses, and be admired as she
has been, without all manner of reports getting
about. But she is heartily sick of that kind of life,
an endless web of unmeaning gaieties  that is
what she herself called it. She will be very glad to
settle down to a refined, quiet life  say, at the
West End of London, with a victoria and
brougham, and a small house, prettily furnished.
One can furnish so prettily and so cheaply nowadays,"
concluded Harrington, with his mind's eye
upon certain illustrated advertisements he had seen
of late  Jacobean dining-rooms  Sheraton drawing-rooms
 for a mere song.

I have heard people say that a reformed rake
makes a good husband," said Juanita gravely, " but

I have never beard that a reformed flirt makes a
good wife."

It is a shame to talk like that, Juanita. Every
handsome girl is more or less a flirt. She can't
help flirting. Men insist upon flirting with her."

Does your father know you mean to marry Miss
Baldwin ? "

''No, I have never mentioned marriage to him.
That will come in good time."

And do you think he will approve '? "

I don't know. He is full of old-fashioned prejudices
; but I don't see how he can object to my
marrying into one of the county families."

Don't you think it will be more like Miss Baldwin
marrying out of one of the county families?
I'm afraid from what I know of her brother and of
old Lady Baldwin they would both want her to
marry money."

I suppose they have wanted that for the last
four or five years," answered Harrington ; " but it
has not come off, and they must be satisfied if she
chooses to marry for love."

Well, I mustn't plague you any more, Harry.
I see your heart is too deeply involved. I hope Miss

Baldwin is a nicer girl than I have ever thought her.
Girls are sometimes prejudiced against each other."

Occasionally," said Harrington, with satirical
emphasis.

Lucy finished " Batt, batt," with a final chord in
the bass and a final twirl in the treble, and was pronounced
by her grandmother to have achieved
wonders.

Her time is a little uncertain," her mother remarked
modestly ; " but she has a magnificent ear.
You should see her run to the window when there is
an organ in the street."

"Yes, mother," cried Johnny, "but she never
stays to listen unless there is a monkey on the
top."

December came, and the Hunt Ball, at which
more than one of Miss Baldwin's discarded or discarding
admirers were present. The young lady
looked very handsome in white satin and gauze,
without a vestige of colour about her costume, and
with her bodice cut with an audacity which is the
peculiar privilege of dressmakers who live south of
Oxford Street. The white gown set off Miss Baldwin's

brilliant colouring, and looked well against the
pink coats of her partners.

Harrington's dress suit had been a thing of beauty
and a joy to him when it came home from his
London tailor's, folded as no human hands could ever
fold it again, enshrined in layers of tissue-paper.
His sisters had helped to unpack the tailor's parcel,
and had exclaimed at the extravagance of the corded-silk
lapels and the satin sleeve-lining, and he had
himself deemed that the archetypal coat could
scarcely be more beautiful. Yet in this lurid ballroom
he felt ashamed of his modest black twilled
kersimere, and the insignificance of his white tie.
The fox-hunters seemed to him to have it all their
own way.

Miss Baldwin, however, was not unkind. She
danced with him oftener than with any one else,
especially after supper, when she became unconscientious
and forgetful as to her engagements, and
when her card was found to hold twice as many
names as there were dances, together with a pencil
sketch of a lobster waltzing with a champagne
bottle, supplied by an unknown hand.

It was a cold, clear night, and youth and imprudence

were going in couples to the garden behind the
ball-room for coolness between the dances, and to
look at the frosty stars, which in the enthusiasm of
girlhood were accepted as a novelty. Harrington
and Juliet were among those who ventured into the
garden, the lady wrapped in a great white fur cloak,
which made her look like a haystack in a snow-piece.

Poor Discount brought me this polar bearskin,"
she said. " He shot the bear himself, at the
risk of his life. I had asked him to bring me a
skin when he came home."

You asked him to give you something for which
he must risk his life, and yet you make a great fuss
at accepting Daudet's last novel from me," said
Harrington, with tender reproachfulness.

"Ah, but you and Discount are so different,"
exclaimed Juliet, rather contemptuously. " He was
a great dare-devil, who would have come down hand-overland
on a rope from the moon if there had been
any way of getting up there."

What has become of him ? "

Dead ! He died a year ago  of drink, I'm
afraid  lung-complaint complicated with del. them.
Poor fellow!"

She breathed a deep sigh, with that little pensive
air which in a young lady of experience is as much
as to say, " He was the only man I ever loved," and
then she turned the conversation and talked of the
supper and the champagne, which she sweepingly
condemned.

Harrington hated that talk about the supper. He
would have preferred talking of the stars like a
schoolgirl, or Claude Melmotte, " wondering what
star should be our home when love becomes immortal."
To be told that the wine which now
glowed in his veins and intensified his passion was
not worth three-and-sixpence a bottle jarred upon
his finer feelings. " You are such a cynic," he said.
I think I shall never get any nearer to your real
self  for I know there is a heart under that mocking
vein."

And then he repeated his simple story of a
humble, devoted love  humble because the woman
he loved was the loveliest among all womankind, and
because she occupied a higher plane than that on
which his youth had been spent.

But you have taught me what ambition means,"
be said. " Only promise to be my wife and you

VOL. II. E

shall see that I am in earnest  that it is in me to
succeed."

She had long been wavering  touched by his
truthfulness, his boyish devotion  very weary of life
at the Mount, where the mother scolded and the
sister sneered, where the underfed and underpaid
servants were frankly disobliging, where her brother
rarely saw his womankind except at meals, which
periods of family life he enlivened by a good deal of
strong language, grumbling at the cookery, and at
the deterioration of landed property in general, and
his own in particular. The rest of his home-life he
spent in the billiard room or the stables, since he
found the society of the saddle-room more congenial
than the dreariness of the drawing-room, where his
mother and sisters were not always on speaking-terms.


From such a house as the Mount  goodly and fair
to look upon without as many other whited
sepulchres  any escape would be welcome. Juliet
felt that she was a great deal too good for a
young man of uncertain prospects and humdrum
surroundings ; but he was very much
in love, and he was good-looking, and in her

own particular phraseology she was beginning to be
rather weak about horn. She was so weak that she
let him hold her unresisting hand as they stood
side by side in the garden, and devour it with
kisses.

"You certainly ought to do well in the world,"
she said, sweetly ; " for you are the most persistent
person I ever knew."

He looked round, saw that they were alone in the
garden and clasped her in his arms, polar bear and
all, and kissed the unresisting lips, as he had kissed
the unresisting hand.

My dearest," he exclaimed, " that means for
life, does it not?"

"You are taking everything for granted," she
said ; " but I suppose it must be so. Only remember
I don't want our engagement talked about till
you are in a more assured position. My mother
would make home a hell upon earth, if she knew."

I will do nothing rash, nothing that you do not
approve," replied Harrington, considerably relieved
by this injunction ; for although it was not Matthew
Dalbrook's habit to make a pandemonium of the
family circle, Harrington feared that he would

E 2

LIBRARY 
uivicocrrv OF HL1N01S

strongly disapprove of such an alliance as that which
his younger son had chosen for himself. He welcomed
the idea of delay, hoping to be more firmly
seated at the office desk before he must needs make
the unpleasing avowal. "When my father finds I
am valuable to him he will be more inclined to indulgence,"
he thought.

"For men have marble, women waxen minds,
And therefore are they formed as marble will ;
The weak oppress'd, the impression of change kinds,
Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill ;
Then call them not the authors of their ill."

Inclination would have taken Theodore Dalbrook
to Dorsetshire before the Christmas holidays gave
him an excuse for going home ; but he wrestled
with that haunting desire to revisit the Priory, and
to be again tete-astute v.ith his cousin in the dimly-lighted
room where she had talked to him of her
own sorrows and of his ambitions. The memory of
that last evening was the most vivid element in his
life. It stood out like a spot of light against the
dull grey of monotonous days, and the burden of
dry-adust reading. But he had told her that he
should not see her until Christmas time, and he was
not weak enough to indulge that insane longing for
the society of a woman whose heart was in the grave
of her husband.

November and the greater part of December
stretched before him, like a long dark road which
had to be trodden somehow before he came to the
inn at which there would be light and comfort,
cheerful voices, and friendly greetings. He set his
face resolutely towards that dark prospect, and
tramped along, doing the work he had to do, living
the life of a hermit in those chambers in Ferret
Court, which had already taken the stamp of his
own character, and looked as if he had lived in them
for years.

He had no need to sit alone at night with his
books and his lamp, for there were plenty of houses
in which he would have been welcome. His name
was a passport in legal circles. Old friends of
James Dalbrook's were ready to welcome his kinsman
to their tables, eager to be of service to him.
He had his college friends, too, in the great city,
and need not have gone companionless. But he
was not in the mood for society of any kind, old or
young, except the society of Blackstone, Coke, and
Justinian, and divers other sages who out of the dim
past shed their light upon the legal wilderness of
the present. He sat by his fire and read law, and

laid down his book only to smoke his meditative
pipe and indulge in foolish waking dreams about
that grave old house in Dorsetshire and the young
widow who lived there.

He had followed two of those three children of
the old squire, two out of the three faces in the picture
in the hall at Cheriton, to the end of their
story. No man could discover any postscript to
that story, which in each case was closed by a grave.

There remained only one last unfinished record 
the history of the runaway wife, the end whereof was
open to doubt. That unlucky lady's fate had been
accepted upon hearsay. It had been said that she
had died at Boulogne, within a year or so after the
Vicar met her there.

Upon his return from Jersey, Theodore wrote to
his father's oldest and most experienced clerk, begging
him to hunt up the evidence of Mrs. Darcy's
death, so far as it was obtainable at Cheriton or in
the neighbourhood.

The clerk replied as follows, after an interval often
days : 

Dear Sir,  I have been twice to Cheriton,
and have made inquiries, cautiously as you wished,

with respect to the report of Mrs. Darcy's death,
some fifteen years ago, and saw Mr. Dolby, the
doctor, and Gaster at the general shop, who, as you
are no doubt aware, is a gentleman who busies himself
a good deal about other people's affairs, and sets
himself up for being an authority upon most things.

Mr. Dolby I found very vague in his ideas. He
remembered the late vicar telling him about having
met Mrs. Darcy in the market place at Boulogne,
and being shocked at the change in her. He told
Mr. Dolby that he did not think she was long for
this world ; but it was some time after when Dolby
heard some one  he could not remember who it was
assert that Mrs. Darcy was dead.

Gaster had much more to say upon the subject.
He pretends to be interested in all reminiscences of
the Strangways, and boasts of having served Cheriton
House for nearly forty years. He remembers
Evelyn Strangway when she was a little girl, handsome
and high-spirited. He remembered the report
of her death at Boulogne getting about the village,
and he remembered mentioning the fact to Lord
Cheriton at the time. There was an election going on
just then, and his lordship had looked in to consult

him, Joseph Gaster, about certain business details :
and his lordship seemed shocked to hear of the
poor lady's death. ' I suppose that is the end of
the family, my lord ? ' Gaster said, and his lordship
replied,  Yes, that is the end of the Strangways.'

Gaster believes that he must have read of the
death in the newspapers ; perhaps copied from the
Times into a local paper; at any rate, the fact had
implanted itself in his mind, and it had never occurred
to him to doubt it.

I asked him if he knew what had become of the
lady's husband, but here his mind is a blank. He
had heard that the man was a scamp, and that was
all he knew about him.

Since making these inquiries I have spent a
long evening at the Literary Institute, where, as
you know, there is a set of the Times, in volumes,
extending over a period of forty years. I have
looked through the deaths for three years, taking
the year in which Gaster thinks he heard of Mrs.
Darcy's death, as the middle year out of three, but
without result. It is of course unlikely that the
death would be advertised if the poor lady died
friendless and in poverty in a foreign town ; but

I thought it my duty to make this investigation.


Awaiting your further commands, &c, &c."
There was nothing conclusive in this ; and Theodore
felt that the history of Mrs. Darcy's later years
remained to be unravelled. It was not to be supposed
that the runaway wife, who, if she were yet
living must be an elderly woman, could have had
act or part in the murder of Sir Godfrey Carmichael
; but it was not the less a part of his task
to trace her story to its final chapter. Then only
could he convince Juauita of the wildness of that
idea which connected the catastrophe of the 29th
of July with the exiled Strangways. When he
could say to her, " You see that long before that
fatal night the Squire's three children had vanished
from this earth," she would be constrained to confess
that the solution of the mystery was not to besought
here.

He went over to Boulogne, saw the English chaplain,
and several of the hotel-keepers. He explored
the cemetery, and examined the record of the dead.
He visited the police, and he made friends with the
elderly editor of an old-established newspaper ; but

from all bis questioning of various people the result
was blank. Nobody remembered a Mrs. Darcy, an
Englishwoman of distinguished appearance but
fallen fortunes, a woman long past youth and yet
not old. If she had lived for any time in Boulogne
she had left no trace of her existence ; if she had
died and been buried there she had left no record
among the graves.

Boulogne could tell him nothing. He came back
to the great wilderness of London, the rallying point
for all wanderers. It was there perhaps that the
end of Evelyn Strangway was to be sought.

He had, as it seemed to him, only one cine, the
name of her governess. The governess was only
seven or eight years older than the pupil, and she
might have survived her pupil, and might have been
in communication with her till the end. Jasper
Blake had told him that there was a strong attachment
between Sarah Newton and the wayward girl
she taught.

To hunt for a governess among the thousands of
portionless gentlewomen who try to live by teaching
might seem more hopeless than the proverbial search
for the lost needle, but Theodore did not despair.

If Miss Newton had remained a spinster and had
continued to exercise her vocation as a teacher she
might be traced through one of those agencies which
transact business between governess and employer ;
but, on the other hand, if, as was more likely, she
had long ago abandoned the profession of teacher,
and had made some obscure marriage, she would
have sunk into the vast ocean of middle-class life,
in whose depths it would be almost impossible to
discover her. The first thing to be done was to
make a visitation of the agencies, and this task
Theodore began two days after his return from
Boulogne.

He had methodized his life by this time, devoting
a certain portion of his days to his cousin's interests,
but in no w T rise neglecting the work he had todo
for his own advancement. He had known too
many instances of men who had made reading law
an excuse for an idle and desultory life, and he was
resolved that his own course should be steady and
persistent even to doggedness. He had been told
that success at the Bar was now-a-days almost unattainable
; that the men of the day who had conquered
fame and were making great fortunes, were

in a manner miraculous men. and that it was futile
for any young man to hope to follow in their steps.
The road they had trodden was barred against the
new comer. Theodore listened to these pessimists,
yet was not discouraged. He had told himself that
he would emerge somehow from the obscurity of a
country solicitor's practice  would bring himself in
some wise nearer the social level of the woman he
loved, so that if in the days to come one gleam of
hope should ever shine upon that love he might be
able to say to her, " My place in life is the place
your father held when he offered, himself to your
mother ; my determination to conquer fortune is
not less than his."

He seldom passed the dingy door of the ground-floor
chambers  on which the several names of
three briefless ones were painted in dirty letters that-had
once been white  without thinking of his fortunate
kinsman, without wondering what his life had
been like in those darksome rooms, and in what
shape fortune had first appeared to him. He had
not married until he was forty. Long and lonely
years had gone before that golden summertime of his
life, when a young and lovely woman had given him

happiness and fortune. How had he lived in those
lonely years? Tradition accused him of miserly
habits, of shabby raiment, of patient grinding and
scraping to accumulate wealth. Theodore knew
that if he had hoarded his earnings it had been fora
worthy end. He had set himself to w T in a place
among the lords of the soil. The land he loved had
been to him as a mistress, and for that he had been
content to live poorly and spend his nights in toil.
For such miserliness Theodore had nothing but
admiration ; for he had seen how liberally the man
who had scraped and hoarded was able to administer
a large income  how generous as a master, friend,
and patron the sometime miser had shown himself.

He spent more than a week in visiting the numerous
agencies which are employed by the great
governess-class, and the result of that painstaking
exploration was not altogether barren. He succeeded
in finding an elderly personage at the
head of an old-established Agency, who kept her
books with praiseworthy regularity, and who remembered
Sarah Newton. She had had no less than
four Miss Newton on her register at different times,
but there was only one Sarah Newton among them,

and for this lady she had obtained a situation in the
Lake country so lately as July 20, 1873  that is to
say, about eleven years before the period of Theodore's
investigation.

On that date Miss Xewton had entered the family
of a Mr. Craven  the vicar of a small parish between
Amalekite and Lowness. She was living in that
family four years afterwards, when Miss Palmer, the
Principal in the Agency, last heard of her.

And in all probability she is living there still,"
said Miss Palmer. "At her time of life people are
not fond of change. I remember her when she was
a young woman, full of energy, and very impatient
of control. I used to see her much oftener then.
She seldom kept a situation over a twelve-month."

"Except at Cheriton Chase. She was more thana
year in that situation, I think."

Cheriton Chase ! I don't remember the name.
Some one else may have got her the situation. How
long ago was she there, do you suppose?" asked
Miss Palmer, turning over one of her neat basil-bound
registers.

It was in the year '47 she left Cheriton."

Ah, then, it was not we who got her the situation.

My first entry about her is on the 11th
December, '48. She paid her entrance fee of one
guinea on that date. It is higher than that of
inferior agencies ; but we take real trouble for our
clients, and we make it our business to be safe upon
the point of character. We are as careful about
the families into which we send governesses as
about the governesses we introduce into families."

The next day was Sunday, and Theodore employed
that day of rest in travelling by a very slow
train to Lowness ; where he arrived at five o'clock
in the evening, to find mountain and lake hidden in
densest grey, and an innkeeper who seemed neither
to desire nor deserve visitors. Happily the traveller
was of the age at which dinner is not a vital
question, and he was hardly aware of the
toughness of the steak, or the inferior quality
of the codfish set before him in the desolate coffee
room. He had a diamond Virgil in his pocket, and
he sat by the fire reading the sixth book by the
paraffin lamp till ten o'clock, and then went contentedly
to a bedroom which suggested ghosts, or
at least nightmare.

No deadly visions troubled him, however, for the
slow train had brought about a condition of abject
weariness which resulted in dreamless slumber.
The sun shone into his bleak bed-chamber when he
awoke next morning, and the lake stretched beneath
his windows, silver-shining, melting dimly into
the grey of the opposite shore. The mountains
were sulking still, and only showed their rugged
crests above dark rolling clouds ; but the scene was
an improvement upon the avenue of chimney-pots
and distant glimpse of a murky Thames as seen
from Ferret Court.

His landlord greeted him in a more cheerful
spirit upon Monday morning than he had evinced
on Sunday evening when his after-dinner lethargy
was rudely disturbed by a guest whose business-like
air and small Gladstone bag did not promise much
profit ; a visitor who would want a dinner off the
joint, most likely, and a half-crown breakfast ; a
visitor whose libations would be limited to
bitter beer and an occasional whisky and soda.
Such a guest in a house that was beginning to
hibernate was a burden rather than a boon.

This morning, however, the landlord was reckons

II. f

cited to his solitary customer, having told his wife
that after all, " little fish are sweet," and he went
blithely to order the dog-cart  his own cart and own
man  ostler in the season, coachman or anything
you please out of the season  to drive Mr. Dal-brook
to Kettisford Vicarage, a nine-mile journey.

It was a pretty, out-of-the-way nook  half hidden
in a cleft of the hills  at which Theodore arrived
a few minutes after noon ; a little, old-fashioned,
world-forgotten village, and a sprawling old grey-stone
house, covered with Virginia creeper, passionflower,
and the feathery leafage of the trumpet ash ;
a long, low house, with heavily thatched roof, projecting
over its upper casements ; a sleepy-looking
old house in a still sleepier garden, so remote and
so sheltered that winter had forgotten to come
there ; and the great yellow roses were still blooming
on the wall, fattened by the misty atmosphere of
the adjacent lake, glorified by the untainted air.
November was half over, yet here the only signs
of autumn were the grey sky, and the crimson of
the Virginia creeper.

The Vicar of Kettisford was one of those privileged
persons who can speak with their enemies

at the gate, assured of being backed up in their
speech by a family contingent. The Vicarage
seemed overflowing with young life, from the very
threshold of the hall, where cricket-bats, a tricycle,
a row of well-used tennis rackets, a stupendous
array of hats, overcoats, and comforters, testified
to that quiverful so esteemed in the patriarchal age.

A conscientious performer was pounding at the
Harmonious Blacksmith " upon a wiry piano near
at hand, having left the door wide open, with the
indecent disregard of other people peculiar to
juvenile performers upon all kinds of instruments.
From the other side of the hall came the twanging
of an equally wiry guitar, upon which girlish
fingers began, and for ever re-commenced a Spanish
melody, which the performer was striving to attain
by that agonizing process known among young
ladies as "picking up" an air. Mark, gentle
reader, what the learned and reverend Hawes has
to say upon this art of playing by ear !

From a remoter room came young voices and
young laughter ; and amidst all these sounds it was
hardly surprising that Mr. Dalbrook had to ring
three times, and to wait in front of the open hall

f 2

door for at least ten minutes, before an elderly
housemaid responded to his summons and ushered
him into the Vicar's study, the one room in the
Vicarage which was ever fit to receive a visitor.

The Vicar was reading a newspaper in front of a
comfortable fire. He was an elderly man, of genial
and even jovial aspect, and he received Mr. Dal-brook's
apologetic account of himself and his
business with perfect good humour.

You want to see Miss Newton, my dear sir. I
am sorry to tell you she left us nearly two years
ago  heartily sorry, for Sarah Newton is a very
worthy woman, and a jewel of price in a motherless
family like mine," said the Vicar. "I regret that
you should have come such a long way to find her
when, had you written to me, I could have told you
where to look for her in London."

Yes, it was a mistake to come so far without
making preliminary inquiries  only, as she had not
applied to her usual agent for a new situation, I
concluded that she was still under your roof."

She has not gone into a new situation, Mr.
Dalbrook. She was too much valued in this house
to wish to change to another employment, although

she might have lived more luxuriously and done
less work elsewhere. She was a mother to my
girls  ay, and to my boys as well  while she was
with us : and she only left us when she made up
her mind to live an independent life."

She has left off teaching, then, I conclude ? "
Yes. She had a little bit of money left her by
a bachelor uncle, safely invested in railway stock,
and yielding about two hundred a year. This, with
her own savings, made her an independent woman,
and she made up her mind to realize her own ideal of
a useful life  an ideal which had been developing in
her mind for a good many years  a life which was to
be serviceable to others, and yet pleasant to herself."
Do you mean that she joined some sisterhood?"
No, no, Mr. Dalbrook, Sarah Newton is much
too fond of her own way, much too independent and
fiery a spirit, to place herself in a position where
other people would think for her, and where she
would be obliged to obey. She told me her plan of
life very frankly. ' I have about two hundred and
sixty pounds a year,' she said ; ' I can live comfortably
upon half that money, if I live after a plan of
my own ; and I can do a great deal of good with

the other half if I do it in my own way. I am
elderly and plain. If I were to live amongst small
gentilities I should be a nobody, and in all probability
I should be considered a bore. I shall take
a lodging in a poor neighbourhood, furnish my
rooms with the utmost comfort, treat myself to a
good piano, and collect my little library book by
book from the second-hand booksellers. I shall
spend half my days in going quietly about among
the poor young women of the district  I ought to
know what girls are after nearly forty years' teaching
and managing the species  and I shall spend
half my income in doing as much good to them as
I can, in my own unorthodox way.' I knew the
good that brave little soul had done in this parish,
in her quiet, unpretentious fashion, and I felt no
doubt she would carry out her plan."

Have you seen her since she left you ? "
Yes, I went to see her last June when I had a
fortnight's holiday in London. I found her in a
shabby old house in Lambeth, not very far from
St. Thomas's Hospital ; but dingy as the house
looked outside, our good Sally's apartments were
the picture of comfort. I found her as happy as a

bird. Her plan of life had answered her highest
expectations. ' My friends are legion,' she said,
but I haven't a single gentility among them.'
Sally is a desperate Radical, you must know."

Will you give me her address, that I may
write and ask her permission to call upon
her?"

You shall have the address, but I doubt if she
will feel disposed to receive you. She will count
you among the gentilities."

I must try my chance at any rate. I want her
to throw some light upon the history of one of her
earliest pupils. Did you ever hear her talk of
Cheriton Chase and the Strangway family? "

My dear sir, I have heard her talk of any
number of places, and any number of people. I
used to tell her she must be a female Methuselah to
have passed through so many experiences. She
was very fond of telling stories of the families in
which she had lived, but though I used to listen I
remember very little about them. My girls would
remember better, I have no doubt. They can give
you chapter and verse, I daresay ; so the best thing
you can do is to eat your luncheon with us, and

then you can ask them as many questions as you
like."

Theodore accepted the offer with gratitude, and
ten minutes afterwards followed the Vicar into the
dining-room, where three tall, good-looking girls
and two straggling youths were assembled, and
where a fourth girl and another boy dropped in
after the rest were seated. The board was spread
with a plenteous but homely meal. A large dish
of Irish stew smoked at one end of the table, and
the remains of yesterday's roast ribs of beef appeared
at the other.

The girls were evidently accustomed to droppers
in, and received Theodore with perfect equanimity.

Alicia, the eldest, carved the beef with a commanding
wrist, and the third daughter, Laura,
administered to his appetite with pickled walnuts
and mashed potatoes. The girls were all keenly
interested directly he spoke of Miss Newton. They
pronounced her a dear old thing, not a bit like a
governess.

"We all loved her," said Alicia; "and we are
not the easiest girls to get on with, I can assure
you. We have had two poor things since Sally

deserted us, and we have driven them both away.
And now we are enjoying an interregnum, and
we hope the dear father will make it a long
one.

Did you ever hear your governess talk of the
Strangways, Bliss Craven?"

"What, Evelyn Strangway, of Cheriton Chase?
I should think we did, indeed," cried Laura. " She
had a good many prosy stories  chestnuts, we used
to call them  but the Cheriton Chase stories were
the most chestnut. It was her first situation,
and she was never tired of talking about it."

Do you know if she kept up her acquaintance
with Miss Strangway in after life ? " asked
Theodore.

"I think not; at any rate, she never talked about
that. She knew something about the poor girl's
later life  something very bad, I think  for she
would never tell us. She used to sigh and look
very unhappy if the subject was touched upon : and
she used to warn us against runaway matches. As
if any of us would be likely to run away from this
dear old father ? " protested Laura, leaning over
the table to pat the Yicar's coat sleeve. " Why, he

would let us marry chimney-sweeps rather than see
us unhappy."

There was a good deal more talk about Sarah
Newton, her virtues and her little peculiarities, but
nothing bearing upon Theodore's business, so he
only stayed till luncheon was finished, and then
wished the amiable Vicar and his family a friendly
good-bye, offering to be of use to them in London
at any time they might want some small business
transacted there, and begging the Vicar to look him
up at his chambers when he took his next holiday.

You may rely upon it I shall take you at your
word," said the parson cheerily. " You've no idea
what a gay old dog I am when I am in town  the
theatre every night, and a little bit of supper afterwards.
I generally take one of my lads with me,
though, to keep me out of mischief. Good-bye,
and mind you don't fall in love with Sally Newton.
She's old and ugly, but she's one of the most
fascinating women I know."

Theodore drove off in the dog-cart with all the
Vicarage family at the gate waving their hands to
him, as if he had been an old friend, and with four
Vicarage dogs barking at him.

He went back to London that night, and wrote to
Miss Newton, asking leave to call upon her upon a
matter relating to one of her old pupils on the
following day. He should take silence to mean
consent, and would be with her at four in the afternoon,
if he did not receive a telegram to forbid him.

He worked in his chambers all the morning, and
at a little after three set out to walk to Lambeth.
The address was 51, Wedge wood Street, near the
Lambeth Road. It was not a long walk, and it was
not a pleasant one, for a seasonable fog was gathering
when Theodore left the Temple, and it thickened ashe
crossed Westminster Bridge, where the newly-lighted
lamps made faint yellow patches in the
dense brown atmosphere. Under these conditions
it took him some time to find Wedgwood Street,
and that particular house which had the honour of
sheltering Sarah Newton.

It was a very shabby old street. The shops were
of the meanest order, and the houses which were not
shops looked as if they were mostly let off to the
struggling class of lodgers ; but it was a street that
had evidently seen better days, for the houses were
large and substantially built, and the doorways had

once been handsome and architectural  houses which
had been the homes of prosperous citizens when
Lambeth was out of town, and when the perfume of
bean blossom and new mown hay found its way into
Wedgewood Street.

The ground-floor of Number 51 was occupied by
a shoemaker, a shoemaker who had turned his
parlour into a shop, who made to measure, but was
not above executing repairs neatly. The front door
being open, Theodore walked straight upstairs to the
first-floor landing, where there was a neat little
Dutton ware oil-lamp burning on a carved oak
bracket, and where he saw Miss Newton's name
painted in bold black letters upon a terra-cotta
coloured door. The stairs were cleaner than they
generally are in such a house, and the landing was
spotless.

He rang a bell, and the door was promptly opened
by a lad 7 , whom he took to be Miss Newton. She
was rather below middle height, strongly built, but
of a neat, compact figure. She was decidedly plain,
and her iron grey hair was coarse and wiry ; but she
had large bright eyes which beamed with good nature
and intelligence. Her black stuff gown and narrow

linen collar, the knot of scarlet ribbon at her throat,
and the linen cuffs turned back over perfectly-fitting
sleeves, were all the pink of neatness, and suited her
as no other kind of dress would have done. The
trim figure, the bright eyes, and the small white
hands made a favourable impression upon Theodore,
in spite of the lady's homeliness of feature and complexion.


\Yalk in, Mr. Dalbrook." she said cheerily.
Pray come and sit by the fire, you must be chilled
to the bone after coming through that horrid fog.
Ah, how I hate fog. It is the scourge of the London
poor, and it sometimes kills even the rich. And
now we are only at the beginning of the evil, and
there is the long winter before us."

Yes, it is very bad, no doubt ; but you do not
look as if the fog could do you much harm, Miss
Newton."

Xo, it won't hurt me. I'm a hardy old plant,
and I contrive to make myself comfortable at all
seasons."

"You do, indeed," he answered, glancing ground
the room. " I had no idea "

That anybody could be so comfortable in Lambeth,"

she said, interpreting his thoughts. " No,
people think they must pay for what they call ' a
good situation.' Poor pinched widows and shabby
spinsters spend more than half their income on rent
and taxes, and starve on the other half, in order to
live in a genteel locality  some dingy little street in
Publico perhaps, or a stucco terrace in Kensington.
Here am I with two fine large rooms in a forgotten
old street, which was built before the age of shoddy.
I live among poor people, and am not obliged to
sacrifice a sixpence for the sake of appearances. I
buy everything in the cheapest market, and my
neighbours look up to me, instead of looking down
upon me, as they might if I lived among gentilities.
You will say, perhaps, that I live in the midst of
dirt and squalor. If I do I take care that none of
it ever comes near me, and I do all that one woman's
voice and one woman's pen can do to lessen the evils
that I see about me."

"It would be a good thing for poor neighbourhoods
if there were many ladies of your mind, Miss
Newton," said Theodore, basking in the glow of the
fire, and looking lazily round the room, with its two
well-filled bookcases, occupying the recesses on each

side of the fireplace, its brackets and shelves, and
hanging pockets, its large old-fashioned sofa, and
substantial claw-footed table, its wicker chairs,
cushioned with bright colour  its lamps and candlesticks
on shelf and bracket, ready to the hand when
extra light should be wanted, its contrivances and
hardiness of all kinds, which denoted the womanly
inventiveness of the tenant.

u Well, I believe it would. If only a small percentage
of the lonely spinsters of England would
make their abode among the poor, things would have
to be mended somehow. There could not be such
crying evils as there are if there were mere eyes to
see them, and more voices to protest against them.
You like this old room of mine, I see, Mr. Dal-brook,"
added Sarah Newton, following his eyes
as they surveyed the dark red wall against which
the brackets and shelves, and books and photographs,
and bits of old china stood out in bright
relief.

"lam full of admiration and surprise ! "
"It is all my own work. I had lived in other
people's houses so long that I was charmed to have
a home of my own, even in Lambeth. I was determined

to spend very little money, and yet to
make myself comfortable ; so I just squatted in the
next room for the first three months, with only a
bedstead, a table, and a chair or two, while I
prowled all over London to find the exact furniture
I wanted. There's not an article in the room that
did not take me weeks to find and to buy, and
there's not an article that wasn't a tremendous
bargain. But what an egotistical old prattler I am !
Women who live much alone get to be dreadful prospers.
I won't say another word about myself  at
any rate, not till after I've made you a cup of tea
after your cold walk."

She had seen the mud upon his boots and guessed
that he had walked from the Temple.

Pray do not take any trouble "

Nonsense; it is never trouble to a woman to
make tea. I give a tea party twice a week. I hope
you like tea ? "

I adore it. But pray go on with your account
of how \ou settled down here. I am warmly interested."


That's very good of you  but there's not much
to tell about myself," said Miss Newton, producing

some pretty old china out of an antique cupboard
with glass doors, and setting out a little brass tea
tray while she talked.

There was a small copper kettle singing on the
old-fashioned hob, and there was a covered dish of
toast in the capacious fender. Miss Newton's dinners
were ever of the slightest, but she was a sybarite
as to her tea and toast. No cheap and powdery mixture
; no " inferior Dorset " for her. She made her
brew with a dainty precision which Theodore admired,
while she went on talking.

Do you like the colour of the walls ? Yes, I
painted them. And you like that paper on the ceiling
? I papered it. I am rather a dab at carpentering,
too, and I put up all those shelves and brackets,
and I covered the chairs, and stained the boards
round that old Turkey carpet ; and then, after a day's
hard work, it was very pleasant to go and stroll about
among the bookshops of an evening and pick up a
volume here and there till I got all my old friends
about me. I felt like Elia ; only I had no Bridget
to share my pleasure."

She seated herself opposite to him with a wicker
table in front of her, and began to pour out the tea.

VOL. II. G

He wondered to find himself as much at home with
her as if he had known her all his life.

"It is very good of you to receive me so cordially,"
he said, presently. " I feel that I come to
you as an unauthorized intruder."

Can you guess why I was willing to receive you ?"
she asked, looking at him intently and with a sudden
gravity. " Can you guess why I didn't telegraph to
forbid your coming ?"

"Indeed, no, except because you are naturally
kind."

My kindness had nothing to do with it. I was
willing to see you because of your name. It is a
very familiar name to me  Dalbrook, the name of
the man who bought the house in which she was
born. Poor soul, how she must have hated him, in
her desolate after years. How she must have hated
the race that ousted her from the home she loved."
You are talking of Evelyn Strangway ! "

Yes, she was my first pupil, and I was very fond
of her  all the fonder of her, perhaps, because she
was wayward and difficult to manage : and because
I was much too young and inexperienced to exercise
any authority over her."

It is of her I want to talk to you, if you will
allow me."

Certainly. I like talking of those old days
when I was a girl. I don't suppose I was particularly
happy at Cheriton Chase ; but I was young,
and we most of us hug the delusion that we were
happy in our youth. Poor Evelyn  so often in disgrace
 so often unhappy, from the very dawn of
girlhood. What reason can you have for being
curious about her ? "

I have a very strong reason, though I cannot
explain it yet awhile. I have set myself to discover
the history of that banished race."

"After the angel with the flaming sword stood at
the gate  that is to say, after Mr. Dalbrook bought
the property. By the by, what are you to Lord
Cheriton ? His son perhaps ? "

"No, lam only a distant cousin."

"Is it on his account you are making these inquiries
? "

"He is not even aware that I am making
them."

Indeed, and pray how did you find me out ?
My tea-parties are not recorded in the Society papers

g 2

I have never figured among ' Celebrities at
Home.' "

I took some pains to find you," said Theodore,
and then he told her of his visits to the agencies,
and his journey to the Vicarage in Lakeland.

You have taken infinite trouble, and for a small
result. I can give you very little information about
Evelyn Strangway  afterwards Mrs. Darcy."

Did you lose sight of her after you left Cheriton?"


"Yes, for a long time. It was years before we
met again ; but she wrote to me several times from
Lausanne, during the first year of her banishment ;
doleful letters, complaining bitterly of her father's
cruelty in keeping her away from her beloved
Cheriton, the horses and dogs, the life she loved.
School she detested. She was clever, but she had
no taste for intellectual pursuits. She soon wearied
of the lake and the mountains, and the humdrum
society of a small town. She wrote of herself as a
galley-slave. Then came a sudden change, and she
began to write about him, You don't know the way
a girl writes about him ; the first him she has ever
thought worthy to be written about. Her tone was

light enough at the beginning. She had met a
young Irishman at a little evening party, and they
had laughed together at Lausanne society. He was
an officer, on furlough, full of wit and fun. I need
not go into details. I saw her danger, and waiter
; I reminded her that her father would never
allow her to marry a subaltern in a marching regiment,
and that such a marriage would mean starvation.
Her father could give her nothing ; it was
incumbent on her to marry well, and with her
attractions she had only to wait for a good offer. It
would inevitably come in due time."

She was handsome, I suppose ? I know her
face in the picture at Cheriton. My cousin bought
all the old portraits."

She was much handsomer than the picture.
That was painted when she was only fifteen, but at
seventeen her beauty had developed, and she was one
of the most brilliant blondes I ever saw. Well, I
suppose you know how useless my advice was. She
ran away with her Irish admirer, and I heard no
more of her for nearly four years, when I met her
one afternoon in the Strand, and she took me home
to her lodging in Cecil Street, and gave me some

tea. It was in October, and I stayed with her till
dark, and then she insisted on seeing me off in the
omnibus to Havelock Hill, where I was then
living in an artist's family. The lodgings were
shabby, and she was shabbily dressed. She was as
handsome as ever, but she looked worried and unhappy.
Her husband had sold out of the army, and
had a position as secretary to a West End club.

She told me that they would have been pretty
well off but for his extravagance. He was getting
four hundred a year, and they had no children. She
complained that it was her fate to be allied with
spendthrifts. Her father had squandered his fortune
; and her husband's improvident habits kept
her in continual debt and difficulty. It grieved me
to see the shabbiness of her surroundings  the
squalid lodging-house parlour, without so much asa
bunch of flowers or a stand of books to show that
it was in the occupation of a lady. There was a
cigar-box on the mantelpiece, and there was a heap
of newspapers on the sofa, and a pair of shabby
slippers inside the fender. It was a room to make
one shudder. I asked her if she was reconciled to
her father, and she said no ; she had heard nothing

of him since her marriage. I felt very unhappy
about her after we parted at Hungered Market. I
saw her standing on the pavement as the omnibus
drove away, a tall, slim figure, distinguished-looking
in spite of her shabby mantle and rusty black silk
gown. I had promised to go and see her again,
though I was very seldom at liberty at that time,
and I went to Cecil Street two or three times in the
course of the winter, but she was always out, and
there was something in the tone of her letters that
made me think she did not wish to see me again,
though I believe she was fond of me always, poor
soul. I saw nothing more of her, and heard nothing
until nearly four years afterwards, when I was
spending an afternoon at Richmond with my pupils
two girls of fourteen and sixteen  and I came
face to face with her in front of Thomson's Seat.
She was with a tall, handsome man, whom at first I
took to be her husband : but there was something in
the manner of both of them that impressed me uncomfortably,
and I began to fear that this was not her
husband. She looked much brighter than when I
saw her in Cecil Street, and she was better dressed
very plainly, but in excellent taste. She took me

aside a little way while her companion stood and
talked to the two girls. She put her arm through
mine in her old caressing way, and then she said,
abruptly, ' I almost wonder that you will speak tome.
I thought you would cut me dead.' I looked
puzzled, no doubt ; so she said, ' Perhaps you don't
know what a lost creature I am. Perhaps you have
not heard.' I told her I had heard nothing about
her since we parted at Hungered Market, and then
she gave a deep sigh, and said, ' Well, I am not
going to deceive you. That,' with a jerk of her
head towards the man who was standing with his
back to us, ' is not my husband, but he and I are
bound together for the rest of our lives, and we are
perfectly happy together. Society would scorn us
and trample upon us no doubt if we gave it a
chance ; but we don't. We live out of the world,
and we live for one another. Now, aren't you
shocked with me ? Don't you want to run away ? '
she asked, with a little laugh, which sounded as if
she was very nearly crying. I told her that I was
very sorry for her. I could say no more than that.
You would be sorrier still if you could picture to
yourself the miserable life I led before I left my

husband,' she said. ' I bore it for five years, years
that seemed an eternity. He cared for me no more
than for the flower-girls in the street. He left me
to pine in my dingy lodging, left me to be dunned
and worried all day long, left me out-at-elbows,
ashamed of my own shabbiness, while he amused
himself at his club ; and then he considered himself
cruelly used when he found out there was another
man in the world who thought me worth caring for,
and when I told him I loved that man with all my
heart. My leaving him was the impulse of a
moment. The moment came when his brutality
turned the scale, and I ran out of the house in my
despair, and jumped into the first cab I could hail,
and drove away to him, 1 pointing to the man in the
distance, strolling beside my two gawky girls, ' and
to happiness. I am a wicked wretch, no doubt, to
be happy under such circumstances, but I am, or,
at any rate, as happy as anybody can hope to be in
this world. There is always a thorn among the
flowers,' she sighed, as if the thorn was a big one, I
thought. ' I suppose I shall never see you again,'
she said. ' When we say good-bye presently, it will
be farewell for ever.' I told her that was not inevitable.

I was my own mistress, free to choose my
friends. I told her that if ever she had need of a
friend I would go to her. I felt that I was in some
wise answerable for the bad turn her life had taken,
for had I been a more judicious counsellor, I might
have guided her better, might have prevented her
coming into collision with her father. I asked her
for her address, but she told me she had promised
to tell nobody where she lived. ' We are living
out of the world,' she said, ' we have no visitors,
no friends or acquaintance.' She clasped my
hands, kissed me, and hurried away to rejoin the
man whose name I never learned. He lifted his
hat to me and the girls, and they walked away together
towards the Star and Garter, leaving us
standing by Thomson's Seat, staring idly at the
landscape in the summer sunlight. I felt dazed as
I stood there, looking down into that lovely valley.
It had been a terrible shock to me to meet her
again under such circumstances."

Be useful where thou livest, that they may
Both want and wish thy pleasing presence still.

All worldly joys go less

To the one joy of doing kindnesses."

"What impression did the man make upon you in
that brief meeting?" asked Theodore. "Did he
strike you as a roue f

No, that was the odd part of the business. He
had the steady, respectable air of a bread-winner, a
professional, or perhaps a commercial man. I could
not tell which. There was nothing flashy or dissipated
in his appearance. He looked me steadily
in the face when he bowed to me at parting, and he
had a frank, straight-forward expression, and a grave
decision of manner that was not without dignity.
He was soberly dressed in a style that attracted no
attention. I had no doubt that he was a gentleman."


He was handsome, you say ? "

Yes, he was decidedly handsome  but I can
remember only the general character of his face, not
features or details, for I saw him only twice in my
life."

Ah, you saw him again ? "

Once again  some years later, after her deaths''

She is dead, then ? " cried Theodore ; " that is
the fact I am most anxious to learn from a reliable
source of information. There was a rumour of her
death years ago, but no one could give me any
evidence of the fact. I went to Boulogne last week
to try and trace her to her last resting-place ; but I
could discover neither tombstone nor record of any
kind."

And yet it was at Boulogne she died. I will
tell you all I know about her, if you like. It doesn't
amount to much."

Pray, tell me everything you can. I am deeply
grateful to you for having treated me with so much
frankness."

It was on her account I received you. I am glad
to talk to any one who is interested in her pitiful
fate. There were so few to care for her. I think
there is no lot more sad than that of a broken-down

gentleman's daughter, born to an inheritance she is
never to enjoy, brought up to think of herself as a
personage, with a right to the world's respect, and
finding herself friendless and penniless in the bloom
of her womanhood, exposed to the world's
contumely. "

Theodore's face flushed a little at this mention of
his interest in the unhappy lady, for he could but
feel that the interest was of a sinister kind ; but he
held his peace, and Miss Xewton went on with her
story.

It waft ever so man? rears after that meeting in
Richmond Park  I think it must have been nearly ten
years  when I ran against that very man upon a
windy March day in Folkestone. I had thought much
and often of my poor girl in all those years, wondering
how the world had used her, and whether the
lover whom she trusted so implicitly had been true
to her. I shuddered at the thought of what her fate
might have been if he were false. I had never heard
a word about her in all that time. I had seen no
report of a Divorce suit in the papers. I knew
absolutely nothing of her history from the hour I
parted with her by Thomson's Seat till I ran against

that man in Folkestone. I am rather shy about
speaking to strangers in a general way ; but I was
so anxious to know her fate that I stopped this man,
whose very name was unknown to me, and asked
him to tell me about my poor friend. He looked bewildered,
as well he might, at being pounced upon
in that manner. I explained that I was Evelyn
Strangway's old governess, and that I was uneasy at
having lost sight of her for so many years, and was
very anxious to see her again. He looked troubled
at my question, and he answered me gravely  ' I am
sorry to say you will never do that. Your friend is
dead.' I asked when she died, and where ? He
told me within the last month, and at Boulogne. I
asked if he was with her at the last, and he said
no ; and then he lifted his hat and muttered something
about having very little time to get to the
station. He was going to London by the next train
it seemed, and he was evidently anxious to shake me

off but I was determined he should answer at least

one more question. ' Was her husband with her
when she died ? ' I asked. His face darkened at the
question, which I suppose was a foolish one. ' Do
you think it likely ? ' he said, trying to move past

me ; but I had laid my hand upon his sleeve in my
eagerness. ' Pray tell me that her end was not unhappy
 and that she was penitent for her sins.'
He looked very angry at this. ' If I stand here
talking to you another minute I shall lose my train,
madam,' he said, ' and I have important business in
London this afternoon.' A fly came strolling by at
this moment. He hailed it and jumped in, and he
drove off into what Thomas Carlyle would call the
Immensities. I never saw him again ; I never knew
his name, or calling, or place of abode, or anything
about him. I can no more localize him than I can
Goethe's Mephistopheles. God knows how he
treated my poor girl  whether he was kind or cruel ;
whether he was faithful to a dishonourable tie, or
whether he held it as lightly as such ties have been
held by the majority of men from Abraham downwards."


The little woman's face flushed and her eyes filled
as she gave vent to her feelings.

And this is all you know of Evelyn Strangway ? "
said Theodore, when she had finished.

This is all I know of her. And now tell me
why you are so anxious to learn her history  you

who can never have seen her face, except in the
picture at Cheriton. I dressed her for that picture
and sat by while it was painted."

"I will tell you the motive of my curiosity,"
answered Theodore. "You have treated me so
frankly that I feel I must not withhold my confidence
from you. I know that I can rely upon your discretion."


I can talk, as you have just heard," said Miss
Newton ; " but I can be silent as the grave, when I
like."

You must have read something about the
murder at Cheriton last July."

I read a great deal about it. I took a morbid
interest in the case, knowing the house so well in
every cranny and corner. I could picture the scene
as vividly as if I had seen the murdered man lying
there. A most inexplicable murder, apparently
motiveless."

Apparently motiveless. That fact has so preyed
upon the widow's mind that she has imagined a
motive. She has a strange fancy that one of the
Strangways must have been the author of the crime.
She has brooded over their images till her whole

mind has become possessed with the idea of one of
that banished race, garnering his wrath for long
years, until at last the hour came for a bloody revenge,
and then striking a death-blow out of the
dark  striking his fatal blow and vanishing from the
sight of men, as if a phantom arm had been stretched
out of the night to deal that blow. She has asked
me to help her in discovering the murderer, and I
am pledged to do my utmost towards that end. I
am the more anxious to do so as I tremble for the
consequences if she should be allowed to brood long
upon this morbid fancy about the Strangways. I
think, however, that with your help I have now laid
that ghost. I have traced the two brothers to their
graves ; and I suppose we may accept the statement
of the man you met at Folkestone as sufficient
evidence of Mrs. Darcy's death ; especially as it
seems to fit in with the account of the then Vicar of
Cheriton, who met her in Boulogne in the summer
of '64 looking very ill and much aged."

It was in the spring of '65 I met that man at
Folkestone. I could find the exact date in my diary
if you wished to be very precise about it, for it is
one of my old-maidish ways to be very regular in

VOL. II. H

keeping my diary. Poor Evelyn ! To think that
anyone should be mad enough to suspect her of
being capable of murder  or Fred or Eeginald.
They had the Strong way temper, all three of them ;
and a fiery temper it was when it was roused, a
temper that led to family quarrels and all sorts of
unhappiness ; but murder is a different kind of
thing."

That is the question," said Theodore gravely.
Is there such a wide gulf between the temper that
makes family quarrels, sets father against son, and
brother against brother, and the temper that pulls a
trigger or uses a bowie-knife ? I thought they were
one and the same thing in actual quality, and that
the result was dependent upon circumstances."

Oh, don't talk like that please. Murder is
something exceptional  a hideous solecism in nature
and in this case why murder ? What had Sir
Godfrey Carmichael done that any member of the
Strangway family should want to kill him ? "

' I tell you that the idea is a wild one, the morbid
growth of my cousin's sorrow."

Of course it is. I am very sorry for her, poor
soul. I don't suppose any woman could suffer more

than she must have suffered. It is a dreadful
story. And she was very fond of her husband, I
daresay."

She adored him. They had been lovers almost
from her childhood. There never were a more
devoted bride and bridegroom. Their honeymoon
was not even beginning to wane. They were still
lovers, still in a state of sweet surprise at finding
themselves husband and wife. Poor girl. I saw her
the day before the murder, a brilliant creature, the
very spirit of joy. I saw her the morning after, a
spectre, with awful eyes and marble face  more
dreadful to look upon than her murdered husband."

"It is all too sad," sighed Miss Newton. " I
begin to think that Cheriton is a fatal house, and
that no one can be happy there. However, you can
tell this poor lady that the Strangways are exonerated
from any part in her misery.' '

"I shall write to her to-night to that effect.
And now, Miss Newton, let me thank you once
more for your friendly frankness, and wish you goodnight."


Don't be in such a hurry, Mr. Dalbrook. I
like your face, and I should like to see you again

h 2

some day, if you can find time to waste an hour
upon an old maid in such a God-forsaken place as
Wedge wood Street."

I shall think an hour so spent most delightfully
employed," answered Theodore, who was quite subjugated
by the charm of this little person and her
surroundings.

He did not remember having ever sat in a room
he liked better than this first-floor front in Wedge-wood
Street, with its terra-cotta walls, prettily-bound
books, curious oddments of old china, and
comfortable curtains of creamy workhouse sheeting,
with a bold vermilion border worked by Sarah Newton's
indefatigable fingers.

I should very much like to hear all about your
life in this  strange neighbourhood," he said.

There is not much to tell. When my little
fortune  left by my uncle, the dry salter  fell in tome
I was a lonely old woman, without one surviving
relative for whom I cared twopence. I was pretty
tired of teaching French and German  God knows
how many hundred times I must have gone through
Ollendorff in both languages  and I've done him a
good many times in Italian, par dessus le marche.

Perhaps I might have held on for a year or two
longer, as I was very fond of those nice girls and
boys at Kettisford Vicarage, if it hadn't been for
Ollendorff. He decided me. Leila, the youngest
girl, had only just begun that accursed book. She
was blundering over ' the baker's golden candlestick
' the very morning I got the lawyer's letter to
tell me of my uncle's death, and the will, and the
legacy. I snatched the book out of her hand, and
shut it with a bang. 'Ain't I to do any more
Ollendorff, Sally ? ' she asked. ' You may do as
much as you like, my love,' I said, ' but you'll dono
more with me. I'm a millionaire, or at least I
feel as rich and independent as if I were a Rothschild.'
Well, I lay awake all that night making
plans for my life, and trying to think out how I
could get the most comfort out of my little fortune,
enjoy my declining years, have everything I wanted,
and yet be of some use to my fellow-creatures ; and
the end of it was that I made up my mind to take
a roomy lodging in a poor neighbourhood, where I
should not be tempted to spend a penny upon
appearances, furnish it after my own heart, and
make myself happy in just my own way, without

caring a straw what anybody thought about me. I
knew that I was plain as well as elderly, that I
could never be admired, or cut a figure in the
genteel world, so I determined to renounce the
gentilities altogether and to be looked up to in a
little world of my own."

And you have found your plan answer "

It has answered beyond my hopes. Ever since
I was thirty years of age and had finished with all
young ideas and day-dreams, I had one particular
ideal of earthly bliss, and that was the position of a
country squire's wife  an energetic, active, well-meaning
woman, the central figure in a rural village,
having her model cottages and her allotment gardens,
her infirmary, her mission-house  the good
genius of her little community, a queen in miniature,
and without political entanglements, or
menace of foreign war. Now it could never be my
lot to reign on a landed estate, to build cottages, or
cut up fertile meadows for cottagers' gardens ; but I
thought by taking up my abode in a poor neighbourhood,
and visiting in a friendly, familiar way  no
tracts or preaching  among the most respectable
of the inhabitants, and slowly feeling my way

among the difficult subjects, I might gradually
acquire an influence just as strong as that of the
Lady Bountiful in a country parish, and might come
to be as useful in my small way as the squire's wife
with her larger means. And I have done it,"
added Miss Newton triumphantly. " There are
rooms in this street and in other streets that are tome
my model cottages. There are overworked,
underfed women who look up to me as their Providence.
There are children who come and hang to
my skirts as I pass along the streets. There are
great hulking men who ask my advice and get me
to write their letters for them. What could a
squire's wife have more than that ? And yet I
have only a hundred and fifty pounds a year to
spend upon my people."

You give them something more than money.
You give them sympathy  the magnetism of your
strong and generous nature."

Ah, there is something in that. Magnetism is
a good word. There must be some reason why
people attach themselves so ardently to Mr. Gladstone,
don't you know, some charm in him that
holds them almost in spite of themselves, and

makes them think as he thinks, and veer as he
veers. Yes, they swing round with him like the
boats going round with the tide, and they can't help
it any more than the boats can. And I think, to
compare small things with great, there must be
some touch of that magnetic power in me," concluded
Miss Newton.

"I am sure of it," said Theodore, " and I am
sure, too, that you must be like a spot of light
in this dark little world of yours."

I live among my friends. That is the point,"
explained Miss Newton. " I don't come from Belgravia,
or from a fashionable terrace in Kensington,
and tell them they ought to keep their wretched
rooms cleaner, and open their windows and put
flower-pots on their window-sills. I live here, and
they can come and see how I keep my rooms, and
judge for themselves. Their landlord is my landlord
; and a nice life I lead him about water, and
whitewash, and drains. He is thoroughly afraid of
me, I am happy to say, and generally bolts round a
corner when he sees me in the street ; but I am too
quick for his over-fed legs. I tackle him about all
his shortcomings, and he finds it easier to spend a

few pounds upon his property now and then than
to have me upon his heels at every turn; so now
Crook's tenements have quite a reputation in Lambeth.
If you were to see the old dragon you would
wonder at my pluck in attacking him, I can assure
you'

"Your whole life is wonderful to me, Hiss Newton
; and I only wish there were hundreds of
women in this big city living just as you live. Tell
me, please, what kind of people your neighbours
are."

Oh, there are people of all kinds, some of
course who are quite impracticable, for whom I can
do nothing ; but there are many more who are glad
of my friendship, and who receive me with open
arms. The single women and widows are my chief
friends, and some of those I know as well as if we
had been brought up and educated upon the same
social level. They are workwomen of all kinds,
tailoresses, shirt-makers, gilds who work for military
outsiders, extra hands for Court dressmakers, shop-girls
at the humbler class of shops, shoe-binders,
artificial-flower-makers. I wonder whether you
would like to see some of them."

I should like it very much indeed."
Then perhaps you will come to one of my tea-parties.
I give two tea-parties a week all through
the winter, to just as many of my women friends as
this room will hold. It holds about twenty very
comfortably, so I make twenty-five the outside limit.
We rather enjoy a little bit of a crush  and I give
my invitations so that they all have such pleasure as
I can give them, fairly, turn and turn about. We
do not begin our evening too early, for the working
hours are precious to my poor things. We take tea
at eight o'clock, and we seldom separate before half-past
eleven  just as if we were at a theatre. We
have a little music, a little reading and recitation,
and sometimes a round game at cards. When weare
in a wild humour we play dumb-crambo, or even
puss-in-the- corner ; and we have always a great deal
of talk. We sit round this fire-place in a double
semi-circle, the younger ones sitting on the rug in
front of us elders, and we talk, and talk, and talk 
about ourselves mostly, and you can't think what
good it does us. Surely God gave man speech as
the universal safety valve. It lets off half our
troubles, and half our sense of the world's injustice."

Please let me come to your very next party,"
said Theodore, smiling at the little woman's
ardour.

That will be tomorrow evening," replied Miss
Newton. " I shall have to make an excuse for your
appearance, as we very seldom invite a man. You
will have to read or recite something, as a reason for
your being asked, don't you know."

"I will not recoil even from that test. I have
distinguished myself occasionally at a Penny Pleading.
Am I to be tragic  or comic ? "

Be both if you can. We like to laugh ; but we
revel in something that makes us cry desperately.
If you could give us something creepy into the bargain,
freeze our blood with a ghost or two, it would
be all the more enjoyable."

I will satiate you with my talents ; I shall feel
like Pentheus when he intruded upon his mother and
her crew, and shall be humbly grateful for not being
torn to pieces. I daresay I shall be torn to pieces
morally, in the way of criticism. Good night, and
a thousand thanks."

"Wait," said Miss Newton. "I'm afraid it is
much foggier than when you came. I have smelt

the fog coming on while we have been talking.
Wouldn't you like a cab ? "

I should very much, but I doubt if I shall succeed
in finding one."

You wouldn't, but I daresay I can get you one,"
replied Miss Newton, decisively.

She had an unobtrusive little chatelaine at her
side, and from the bunch of implements, scissors,
penknife, thimble, she selected a small whistle.
Then she pulled back one of the cream-white curtains,
opened the window, and whistled loud and
shrill into the fog. Two minutes afterwards there
came a small treble voice out of the darkness.

What is it, Miss Newton ? "

"Who's that ?"

Tommy Meadows."

All right, Tommy. Do you think you could
find a hansom without getting yourself run over?"

Rather ! Do you want it fringed to your door,
Miss ? "

If you please, Tommy."

I'm off," cried the shrill voice, and in less than
ten minutes a two-wheeler rattled along the street,
and drew up sharply at Tommy's treble command,

with Tommy himself seated inside, enjoying the
drive and the uncertainty of the driver.

His spirits were still further exalted by the gift
of sixpence from Theodore as he stepped into
the cab, to be taken back to the Temple at a footpace.


Even that sitting-room of his, which he had taken
pains to make comfortable and home-like, had a
gloomy look after that bright room in Lambeth, with
its terra-cotta walls and cream-coloured curtains, its
gaily-bound books and vivid Vallauris vases perched
in every available corner. He was more interested
in that quaint interior, and in the woman who had
created it, than he had been in any one except that
one woman who filled the chief place in all his
thoughts. The Yicar of Kettisford had not overestimated
Sarah Newton's power of fascination.

He was in Wedgewood Street at a few minutes
before eight on the following evening. The sky
above Lambeth was no longer obscured ; there were
wintry stars shining over that forest of chimney pots
and everlasting monotony of slated roofs ; and even
Lambeth looked lively with its costers' barrows and
bustle of eventide marketing. Theodore found the

door open, as it had been yesterday, and lie found an
extra lamp upon the first floor landing, and the door
of Miss Newton's room ajar, while from within came
the sound of many voices, moderated to a subdued
tone, but still lively.

His modest knock was answered by Miss Newton
herself, who was standing close to the door, ready to
greet every fresh arrival.

How do you do ? We are nearly all here," she
said, cheerily. " I hope you have not just been dining,
for with us tea means a hearty meal, and if you can't
eat anything we shall feel as if you were Banquo's
ghost. How do you do, Mrs. Kirby," to another
arrival. " Baby better, I hope ? Yes, that's right.
How are you, Clara ? and you, Rose ? You've had
that wretched tooth out  I can see it in your face.
Such a relief, isn't it ? So glad to see you, Susan
Dale, and you, Maria, and you, Jenny. Why weare
all here, I do believe."

"Yes, Miss Newton," said a bright-looking girl
by the fire-place, who had been making toast indefatigably
for twenty minutes, and whose complexion
had suffered accordingly. " There are two-and-twenty
of us, four and twenty, counting the gentleman

and you. I think that's as many as you expected."


Yes, everybody's here. So we may as well begin
tea."

In most such assemblies where the intention was
to benefit a humble class of guests, the proceedings
would have begun with a hymn ; but at Miss Newton's
parties there were neither hymns nor prayers
and yet Miss Newton loved her hymn-book, and
delighted in the pathos and the sweetness of the
music with which those familiar words are interwoven
; nor would she yield to anybody in her
belief in the efficacy of prayer ; but she had made
up her mind from the beginning that her tea-parties
were to be pure and simple recreation, and that any
good which should come out of them was to come
incidentally. The women and girls who came at
her bidding were to feel they came to be entertained,
came as her guests, just as, had they been
duchesses, they might have gone to visit other
duchesses in Park Lane or Carlton Gardens. They
were not asked in order that they should be
taught, or preached to, or wheedled into the praying
of prayers or the singing of hymns. They went

as equals to visit a friend who relished their
society.

And did not everybody relish the tea, which might
be described as a Yorkshire tea of a humble
order ; not the Yorkshire tea which may mean
mayonnaise and period pie, chicken and champagne
 but tea as understood in the Potteries of
Hull, or the humbler alleys and streets of Leeds or
Bradford. Three moderate-sized tables had been
put together to make one capacious board, spread
with snowy damask, upon which appeared two large
plum loaves, two tall towers of bread and butter, a
glass bowl of marmalade, a bowl of jam, two dishes
of thinly-sliced German sausage set off with sprigs
of parsley  German sausage bought at the most
respectable ham and beef shop in the Borough, and
as trustworthy as German sausage can be ; and for
crowning glory of the feast a plentiful supply of
shrimps, freshly boiled, savouring of the unseen sea.
The hot buttered toast was frizzling on a brass footman
in front of the fire, ready to be handed round
piping hot, as required. There were two tea-trays,
one at each end of the table, and there were two
bright copper kettles, which had never been defiled
by the smoke of the fire, filled with admirable tea.

Miss Newton took her place at the head of the
table, with Theodore on her right hand, and a pale
and fragile looking young woman on her left. These
two assisted the hostess in the administration of the
tea-tray, handing cups and saucers, sugar-basin and
cream jug; and in so doing they had frequent
occasion to look at each other.

Having gone there prepared to be interested,
Theodore soon began to interest himself in this
young woman, whom Miss Newton addressed as
Marian. She was by no means beautiful now, but
Theodore fancied that she had once been very handsome,
and he occupied himself in reconstructing the
beauty of the past from the wreck of the present.

The lines of the face were classic in their regularity,
but the hollow cheeks and pallid complexion
told of care and toil, and the face was aged untimely
by a hard and joyless life. The eyes were darkest
grey, large and pathetic-looking, the eyes of a woman
who had suffered much and thought much. The
beauty of those eyes gave a mournful charm to the
pale pinched face, and the light auburn hair was
still luxuriant. Theodore noted the delicate hands
and taper fingers, which differed curiously from the

VOL. II. i

other hands which were busy around the hospitable
board.

He could see that this young woman was a
favourite with Sarah Newton, and he told himself
that she was of a race apart from the rest ; but he
was agreeably surprised in finding that except for
the prevailing Cockney accent, and a few slight
lapses in grammar and pronunciation, Miss Newton's
guests were quite as refined as those ladies of Dorchester
with whom it had been his privilege to
associate ; indeed, he was not sure that he did not
prefer the Cockney twang and the faulty grammar to
the second-hand smartness and slang of the young
ladies whose "Awfully jolly," "Ain't it," and
Don't you know," had so often irritated his ear on
tennis lawn or at afternoon tea. Here at least there
was the unstudied speech of people who knew not
the caprices of fashion or the latest catch word that
had descended from Belgravia to Crompton, and
from Crompton to the provinces.

There was a great deal of talk, as Miss Newton
had told him there would be ; and as she encouraged
all her guests to talk about themselves, he gathered
a good deal of interesting information about the

state of the different trades and the ways and
manners of various employers, most of whom
seemed to be of a despotic and grasping temper.
The widows talked of their children's ailments or
their progress at the Board School ; the girls talked
a little, and with all modesty, of their sweethearts.
Sarah Newton was interested in every detail of those
humble lives, and seemed to remember every fact
bearing upon the joys or the sorrows of her guests.
It was a wonder to Theodore, to see how the careworn
faces lighted up round the cheerful table in the
lamp-light. Yes, it was surely a good thing to live
among these daughters of toil, and to lighten their
burdens by this quick sympathy, this cheerful hospitality.
Vast Pleasure Halls and People's Palaces
may do much for the million ; but here was one
little spinster with her small income making an
atmosphere of friendliness and comfort for the few,
and able to get a great deal nearer to them than
Philanthropy on a gigantic scale can ever get to the
many.

Theodore noticed that while most other tongues
babbled freely, the girl called Marian sat silent, after
her task of distributing the tea was over, with hands

i 2

folded in her lap, listening to the voices round her,
and with a soft slow smile lighting her face now
and then. In repose her countenance was deeply
sad, and he found himself speculating upon the
history that had left those melancholy lines upon a
face that was still young.

"I am much interested in your next neighbour'*
he said to Miss Newton, presently, while Marian
was helping another girl to clear the table. " I feel
sure there must be something very sad in her experience
of life, and that she has sunk from a
higher level."

So do I," answered Miss Newton, "but I know
very little more about her than you do, except that
she is a most exquisite worker with those taper
fingers of hers, and that she has worked for the
same baby-linen house for the last three years, and
has lived in the same second floor back in Hercules'
Buildings. I think she is as fond of me as she can
be, yet she has never told me where she was born,
or who her people were, or what her life has been
like. Once she went so far as to tell me that it had
been a very common-place life, and that her troubles
had been in nowise extraordinary  except the fact of

her Laying had a very severe attack of typhus fever,
which left her a wreck. Once from some chance
allusion I learnt that it was in Italy she caught the
fever, and that it was badly treated by a foreign
doctor ; but that one fact is all she ever let slip in
her talk, so carefully does she avoid every mention
of the past. I need hardly tell you that I have
never questioned her. I have reason to know that
her life for the last three years has been spotless, an
industrious, temperate, Christian life, and that she
is charitable and kind to those who are poorer than
herself. That is quite enough for me, and I have
encouraged her to make a friend of me in every way
in my power."

She is happy in having found such a friend, an
invaluable friend to a woman who has sunk from
happier surroundings."

Yes, I think I have been a comfort to her. She
comes to me for books, and we meet nearly everyday
at the Free Library, and compare notes about
our reading. My only regret is that I cannot
induce her to take enough air and exercise. She
spends all the time that she can spare from her
needlework in reading. But I take her for a walk

now and then, and I think she enjoys that. A
pennyworth of the tramcar carries us to Battersea
Park, and we can stroll about amongst grass and
trees, and in sight of the river. She is better off
than most of the girls in the way of getting a little
rest after toil, for that fine, delicate needlework of
hers pays better than the common run of work, and
she is the quickest worker I know."

The tables were cleared by this time, and space
had been made for that half-circle round the fire of
which Miss Newton had spoken on the previous
night. The younger girls brought hassocks and
cushions, and seated themselves in the front rank,
while their elders sat in the outer row of chairs.

Theodore was now called upon to contribute his
share to the entertainment, and thereupon took a
book from his pocket.

You told me you and your friends were fond of
creepy stories, Miss Newton," he said. " Is that
really so ? "

Really and truly."

And you are none of you afflicted with weak
nerves  you are not afraid of being made uncomfortable
by the memory of a ghastly story ? "

No. I think that with most of us the cares of
life are too real and too absorbing to leave any room
in our minds for imaginary horrors. Isn't it so,
now, friends ? "

Lor, yes, Miss Newton," answered one of the
girls, briskly : " we're all of us too busy to worry
about ghosts ; but I love a ghost tale for all
that."

A chorus of voices echoed this assertion.

Then, ladies, I shall have the honour of reading
the ' Haunters and the Haunted,' by Buller
Lytton."

The very title of the story thrilled them, and the
whole party, just now so noisy with eager talk and
frequent laughter, sat breathless, looking at the
reader with awe stricken eyes as that wonderful
story slowly unwound itself.

Theodore read well, in that subdued and semi-dramatic
style which is best adapted to chamber-reading.
He felt what he read, and the horror of
the imaginary scene was vividly before his eyes ashe
got deeper into the story.

The reading lasted nearly two hours, but it was
not one moment too long for Theodore's audience,

and there was a sigh of regret when the last words
of the story had been spoken.

Well," exclaimed one young lady, " I do call
that a first-class tale, don't you, Miss Newton?"

You may go a long way without getting such a
ghost tale as that," said another ; " and don't the
gentleman read beautifully, and don't he make one
feel as if it was all going on in this very room ?
And the dog too ! There, I never see such a thing !
A poor dog to drop down dead, like that."

I did hope that there dog would come to life
again at the end," said one damsel.

By way of diversion after the story, Miss Newton
opened her piano, beckoned three of the girls over to
her, and played the symphony of " Blow, Gentle
Gales," which old-fashioned glee the three girls
sang with taste and discretion, the bass part being
altered to suit a female voice. Then came some
songs, all of which Miss Newton accompanied ; and
then at her request Theodore read again, this time
selecting Holmes' " Wonderful One-horse Shay,"
which caused much laughter ; after which the little
clock on the chimney-piece having struck eleven, he
wished his hostess good-night, selected his coat and

hat from among the heap of jackets and hats on a
table on the landing, and went downstairs.

He was still in Wedgewood Street when he heard
light footsteps coming quickly behind him. It
seemed to him that they were trying to overtake
him, so he turned and met the owner of the feet.

I beg your pardon, sir ; forgive me for following
you," said a very gentle voice, which he recognised
as belonging to the girl called Marian, " I wanted
so much to speak to you  alone."

And I am glad of the opportunity of speaking
to you," he answered. "I felt particularly interested
in you this evening  there are some faces,
you know, which interest us in spite of ourselves
almost, and I felt that I should like to know more
of you."

This was so gravely said that there was no possibility
of an offensive construction being given to the
words.

You are very good, sir. It was your name that
struck me," she answered, falteringly ; " it is a
Dorsetshire name, I think."

Yes, it is a Dorsetshire name, and I am a Dorchester
man."

"Dorchester," she repeated slowly. "I wonder
whether you know a place called Cheriton ? "

"I know it very well, indeed. A kinsman of
mine lives there. Lord Cheriton is my cousin."

I thought as much, directly I heard your name.
You must know all about that dreadful murder,
then  last summer ? "

Yes, I know about as much of it as any one
knows, and that is very little."

They have not found the murderer ? " she
asked, with a faint shudder.

No, nor are they ever likely to find him, I believe.
But tell me why you are interested in Cheriton.
Do you come from that part of the country ? "

Yes."

Were you born in Cheriton village ? "

I was brought up not far from there," she
answered, hesitatingly.

He remembered what Miss Newton had told him
of her own forbearance in asking questions, and he
pursued the inquiry no further.

May I see you as far as your lodgings ? " he
said, kindly. "It will be very little out of my
way."

"So thank you, Mr. Dalbrook. I am too much
accustomed to going about alone ever to want any
escort. Good night, and thank you for having
answered my questions."

Her manner showed a disinclination to prolong
the interview, and she walked away with hurried
steps which carried her swiftly into the darkness.

"Poor lonely soul," he said to himself. "Now,
whose lost sheep is she, I wonder ? She is certainly
of a rank above a cottager's daughter, and
with those hands of hers it is clear she has never
been in domestic service. Not far from Cheriton ?
What may that mean ? Not far is a vague description
of locality. I must ask Lady Cheriton about
her the next time I am at the Chase."

A mind not to be changed by place or time."

Christmas at Dorchester was not a period of
festivity to which Theodore Dalbrook had hitherto
looked forward with ardent expectations, but in this
particular December he found himself longing for
that holiday season even as a schoolboy might long
for release from Latin Grammar and suet pudding,
and for the plenteous fare and idle days of home. He
longed for the grave old town with its Roman relics
and leafless avenues ; longed for it, alas ! not so
much because his father, brother, and sisters dwelt
there, as because it was within a possible drive of
Milbrook Priory, and once being at Dorchester he
had a fair excuse for going to see his cousin. Many
and many a time in his chambers at the Temple he
had felt the fever-fit so strongly upon him that he
was tempted to put on his hat, rush out of those
quiet courts and stony quadrangles to the bustle of

the Embankment, spring into the first hansom that
came within hail, and so to Waterloo, and by any
train that would carry him to Wareham Station, and
thence to the Priory, only to look upon Juanita's
face for a little while, only to hold her hand in his,
once at greeting and once at parting, and then back
into the night and the loneliness of his life, and law
books and precedents, and Justinian and Chitty, and
all that is commonplace and dry-adust in man's
existence.

He had refrained from such foolishness, and now
Christmas was at hand, his sisters were making the
house odious with holly and laurel, the old cook was
chopping suet for the traditional pudding which he
had loathed for the last ten years, and he had a fair
excuse for driving along the frosty roads to visit his
widowed cousin. He had a pressing invitation from
Lord Cheriton to spend two or three days of his
holiday time at the Chase, an invitation which he
had promptly accepted; but his first visit was to Lady
Carmichael.

He found the house in all things unlike what it
had been when last he saw it. The dear Grenvilless
had been persuaded to spend their Christmas in

Dorsetshire, and the Priory was full of children's
voices, and the traces of children's occupation.
Theodore had known Jessica Grenville "before her
marriage, yet it was not the less a shock to find
himself confronted by a portly matron and a brood
of children in that room where he had seen Juanita's
sad face bent over her embroidery. There was no
trace of Juanita in the spacious drawing-room to-day,
and the fact of her absence almost unhinged him,
and put him at a disadvantage in his conversation
with Mrs. Grenville, who received him with gracious
loquacity, and insisted upon his giving an immediate
opinion upon the different degrees of family likeness
to be seen in her four children there present.

These two are decided Carmichael," she said,
putting forward a rather flabby boy and a pudding-faced
girl, " and the other two are thorough Grenville'
indicating the latter and younger pair, who
were seated on the floor building a Tower of Babel
with a lately received present of bricks, and carrying
out the idea by their own confusion of tongues.

Theodore felt glad he was not a Grenville if that
was the type. He murmured some vague civility
about the children, while he shook hands with Lady

Jane, who had come forward shyly to welcome
him, almost obliterated by her more loquacious
daughter.

Don't you think Johnnie the very image of his
poor dear uncle ? " asked Mrs. Grenville urgently, a
question which always agonized Lady Jane, who
could not see the faintest likeness between her snub-nosed
and bilious-looking grandchild and her handsome
son.

Theodore was too nervous to be conscious of his
own untruthfulness in replying in the affirmative.
He was anxious to have done with the children, and
to hear about his cousin.

I hope Juanita is not ill ? " he said.

Oh, no, she is pretty well," replied Lady Jane,
but we keep her as quiet as we can, and of course
the children are rather trying for her ' '

Nobody can say that they are noisy children,' '
interjected the happy mother.

So she seldom leaves her own rooms till the
evening," continued Lady Jane. "You would like
to see her at once, I daresay, Mr. Dalbrook ? And
I know she will be pleased to see you."

She rang, and told the footman to inquire if Lady

Carmichael was ready to see Mr. Dalbrook, and
Theodore had to occupy the interval until the footman's
return with polite attentions to the four
children. He asked Lucy whence she had obtained
those delightful bricks, thereby eliciting the information
that the bricks were not Lucy's, but Godolphin's,
only he "let her play with them," as he
observed magnanimously. He was gratified with
the further information that the tower now in process
of elevation was not a church, but the Tower
of Babel; and he was then treated to the history
of that remarkable building as related in Holy
Writ.

You didn't know that, did you ? " remarked
Godolphin boastfully, when he had finished his
narration in a harsh bawl, being one of those coarse
brats whom their parents boast of as after the pattern
of the infant Hercules.

The footman returned before Godolphin had wrung
a confession of ignorance from the nervous visitor,
and Theodore darted up to follow him out of the
room.

He found Juanita reclining on a low couch near
the fire in a dimly-lighted room, that room which

he remembered having entered only once before, on
the occasion of an afternoon [party at the Priory,
when Sir Godfrey had taken him to his den to show
him a newly acquired folio copy of Thomson's
Seasons, with the famous Bartolozzi mezzo tints. It
was a good old room, especially at this wintry
season, when the dulness of the outlook was of little
consequence. The firelight gleamed cheerily on
the rich bindings of the books, and on the dark
woodwork, and fondly touched Juanita's reclining
figure and the rich folds of her dark plush tea-gown.

How good of you to come to see me so soon,
Theodore," she said, giving him her hand. "I
know you only came to Dorchester yesterday. The
girls were here the day before, and told me they
expected you."

You did not think I should be in the county
very long without finding my way here, did you,
Juanita ? "

Well, no, perhaps not. I know what a true
friend you are. And now tell me, have you made
any further discoveries ? "

One more discovery, Juanita, as I told you
briefly in my last letter. I have traced the Squire's

VOL. II. K

daughter to the sad close of a most unhappy life 
and so ends the Strangway family as you know of
their existence  that is to say, those three Strangers
who had some right to feel themselves
aggrieved by the loss of the land upon which they
were born."

Tell me all you heard from Miss Newton.
Your letter was brief and vague, but as I knew I
was to see you at Christmas I waited for fuller
details. Tell me everything, Theodore."

He obeyed her, and related the bitter, commonplace
story of Evelyn Strangway's life, as told him
by her old governess. There were no elements of
romance in the story. It was as common as the
Divorce Court or the daily papers.

Poor creature ! Well, there ends my theory, at
least about her," said Juanita gloomily. " Her
brothers were dead, and she was dead, long before
that fatal night. Did they bequeath their vengeance
to any one else, I wonder? Who else is
there in this world who had reason to hate my
father or me ? And I know that no creature upon
this earth could have cause to hate my husband."

In your father's calling there is always a possibility

of a deadly hate, inexplicable, unknown to the
subject. Remember the fate of Lord Mayo. A
judge who holds the keys of life and death must
make many enemies."

"Yes," she sighed, "there is that to be thought
of. Oh, my dearest and best, why did you ever link
your life with that of a Judge's daughter ? I feel as
if I had lured him to his doom. I might have foreseen
the danger. I ought never to have married.
What right had I ? Some discharged felon lay in
wait for him  some relentless, Godless, hopeless
wretch  whom my father had condemned to long
imprisonment  whose angry heart my father had
scorched with his scathing speech. I have read some
of his summing up, and they have seemed cruel,
cruel, cruel  so cold, so deliberate, so like a god
making light of the sins of men. Some wretch,
coming maddened out of his silent cell, and seeing
my husband  that white, pure life, that brave,
strong youth  prosperous, honoured, happy  seeing
what a good man's life can be  lay in wait like a
tiger, to destroy that happy life. If it was not one
of the Strangways who killed him, it must have been
such a man."

K 2

Her eyes shone, and her cheeks flushed with a
feverish red. Theodore took her hand, held it in
both his own, and bent to kiss the cold fingers 
not with a lover's ardour, fondly as he loved ;
but with a calm and brotherly affection which
soothed her agitated heart. He loved her well
enough to be able to subjugate himself for her
sake.

My dear Juanita, if you would only withdraw
your thoughts from this ghastly subject ! I will not
ask you to forget. That may be impossible. I entreat
you only to be patient, to leave the chastisement
of crime to Providence, which works in the dark,
works silently, inevitably, to the end for which we
can only grope in a lame and helpless fashion. Be
sure the murderer will stand revealed sooner or later.
That cruel murder will not be his last crime, and in
his next act of violence he may be less fortunate in
escaping every human eye. Or if that act is to bethe
one solitary crime of his life something will happen
to betray him  some oversight of his own, or
some irrepressible movement of a guilty conscience
will give his life to the net, as a bird flies into a
trap. I beseech you, dear, let your thoughts dwell

upon less painful subjects  for your own sake  for
the sake "

He faltered, and left his sentence unfinished, and
Juanita knew that his sisters had told him something.
She knew that the one hope of her blighted life, hope
which she had hardly recognised as hope yet awhile,
was known to him.

I can never cease to think of that night, or to
pray that God will avenge that crime," she said,
firmly. " You think that is an unchristian prayer
perhaps, but what does the Scripture say ? ' Whoso
sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be
shed.' Christ came to confirm that righteous law.
Oh ! it is well to be a humanitarian  to sign petitions
against capital punishment  but let your
nearest and dearest be murdered, and you will be
quick to recognise the justice of that old inexorable
law  a life for a life. That is what J want, Theodore
the life of the man who killed my husband."

If I can help to bring about that end, Juanita,
believe me that I will not shrink from the task ; but
at present I must own that I am off the track, and
see no likelihood of succeeding where a trained detective
has failed. Could I but find a shred of evidence

to put me on the trail, I would pursue that clue to
the bitter end ; but so far all is dark."

"Yes, all is dark!" she answered, dejectedly;
and then, after a pause, she said, " You are going to
stay at Cheriton, I hear ? "

"I am to spend three days there at the turn of
the year, just before I go back to London. I have
chambers in Ferret-court, over the rooms in which
your father spent the golden years of his youth, the
years that made him a great man. It will be very
interesting to me to hear him talk over those years,
if I can beguile him into talking of himself, a subject
which he so seldom dwells upon."

"Ask him if he ever made a bitter enemy. Ask
him for his experience as a Judge at Assizes  find
out, if you can, whether he ever provoked the hatred
of a bad vindictive man."

"1 will question your father, Juanita."

Do ! He will not let me talk to him about the
one subject that occupies my mind. He always
stops me on the threshold of any inquiries. He
might surely help me to find the murderer, with his
highly trained intellect, with his experience of the
darkest side of human nature. But he will not

help me. He would talk more freely to you, no
doubt."

I will sound him," answered Theodore, and then
he tried to beguile her into talking of other things
her home, her surroundings.

It must be a comfort to you to have Lady
Jane."

A comfort ! She is all that I have of happiness
all that reminds me of Godfrey. My mother and
father are very dear to me  I hope you believe that,
Theodore ?  but our lives are parted now. Fly
mother is wrapped up in her husband. Neither of
them can sympathise with me as his mother can.
Their loss is not the same as ours. We two are one
in our grief."

And she is a buffer between you and the outer
world I see. She bears the burdens that would
weigh you down. Those children, for instance  no
doubt they are charming, as children go ; but I
fancy they would worry you if you had too much of
them."

They would kill me," said Juanita, smiling at
him for the first time in their interview. " I am
not very fond of children. It sounds unwomanly to

say so, but I often find myself wishing they could
be born grown up. Fortunately, Lady Jane adores
them. And I am glad to have the Grenvilless at
Christmas time. I want all things to be as they
would have been were my dearest here. I lie here
and look round this room, which was his, and think
and think, and think of him till I almost fancy he is
here. Idle fancy ! Mocking dream ! Oh ! if you
knew how often I dream that he is living still, and
that I am still his happy wife. I dream that he has
been dead  or at least that we have all believed that
he was dead  but that it was a mistake. He is alive ;
our own for long years to come. The wild rapture of
that dream wakes me, and I know that I am
alone. God keep you, Theodore, from such a loss
as mine ! "

"I must gain something before I can lose it,"
he answered, with a shade of bitterness. " I see
myself, as the years go on, hardening into a lonely
old bachelor, outliving the capacity for human affection."


That is nonsense-talk. You think so just now,
perhaps. There is no one beyond your own family
you care for, and you fancy yourself shut out from

the romance of life  but your day will come, very
suddenly, perhaps. You will see some one whom
you can care for. Love will enter your life unawares,
and will fill your heart and mind, and the ambition
that absorbs you now will seem a small thing."

"Never, Juanita. I don't mean to plague you
with any trouble of mine. You have given me your
friendship, and I hope to be worthy of it ; but pray
do not talk to me of the chances of the future. My
future is bounded by the hope of getting on at the
Bar. If I fail in that I fail in everything."

You will not fail. There is no reason you should
not prosper in your profession as my father prospered.
I often think that you are like him  more
like him than you are like your own father."

Their talk touched on various subjects after this
on the great events of the world, the events that
make history  on books and theatres, and then
upon Sarah Newton, whose plan of life interested
Juanita.

He told her of the girl called Marian, and her
inquiries about Cheriton.

I wonder if you ever knew her among your villagers,"
he said. " I should much like to know

who she is. She interests me more than I can say.
There is a refinement in her manners and appearance
that convinces me she must have belonged to
superior people. She was never born in a labourer's
cottage, or amidst a small shopkeeper's shabby surroundings.
She was never taught at a National
School, or broken into domestic service."

"And she was once very handsome, you say?"

Yes, she must have been beautiful, before illness
and trouble set their marks upon her face. She
is only a wreck now, but there is beauty in the
wreck."

How old do you suppose her to be ? "

"Eight or nine-and-twenty. It is difficult to
guess a woman's age within two or three years, and
this woman's face is evidently aged by trouble ; but
I don't think she can be thirty."

There is only one person I can think of who
would in any manner answer your description," said
Juanita, thoughtfully.

"Who is that?"

Mercy Porter. You must have heard about
Mercy Porter, the daughter of the woman at the
West Lodge."

Yes, yes, I remember. She ran away with
a middle-aged man  an army man  one of your
father's visitors."

"I was a child at the time, and of course I
heard very little about it. I only knew that Mercy
Porter who used to come to tea with mother, and
who played the piano better than my governess,
suddenly vanished out of our lives, and that I never
saw her again. My mother was quite fond of her,
and I remember hearing of her beauty, though I
was too young myself to know what beauty meant.
I could not think any one pretty who wore such
plain frocks, and such stout useful boots as Mercy
wore. Her mother certainly did nothing to set off
her good looks, or to instil vanity. Years after, my
mother told me how the girl disappeared one
summer evening, and how Mrs. Porter came distracted
to the house, and saw my father, and
stormed and raved at him in her agony, saying it was
his friend who had blighted her daughter's youth 
his work that she had gone to her ruin. He was
very patient and forbearing with her, my mother
said, for he pitied her despair, and he felt
that he was in some wise to blame for having

brought such an unprincipled man as Colonel
Tremaine to Cheriton, a man who had carried ruin
into many homes. Mercy had been seen to leave
Wareham Station with him by the night mail. He
had a yacht at Weymouth. She wrote to her
mother from London a fortnight afterwards, and
Mrs. Porter brought the letter to my mother and
father one morning, as they sat at breakfast. It
was a heartbroken letter  the letter of a poor foolish
girl who flings away her good name and her hope of
Heaven, with her eyes open, and knows the cost of
her sacrifice, and yet can't help making it. I was
engaged to Godfrey when I first heard Mercy's
story, and I felt so sorry for her, so sorry, in the
midst of my happy love. What had I done to
deserve happiness more than she, that life should be
so bright for me and so dark for her. I did not
know that my day of agony was to come."

Did you ever hear how Colonel Tremaine treated
her?"

No ! I believe my father wrote him a very
severe letter, and called upon him to repair the
wrong he had done ; but I don't think he even took
so much trouble as to answer that letter. His

regiment was ordered off to India two or three years
afterwards, and he was killed in Afghanistan about
six years ago."

"And has nothing been heard of Mercy since
her flight ? "

Nothing."

I wonder her mother has sat at home quietly all
these years instead of making strenuous efforts to
find her lost lamb," said Theodore.

Ah, that is almost exactly what Godfrey said of
her. He seemed to think her heartless for taking
things so quietly. She is a curious woman  self-contained,
and silent. I sometimes fancy she was
more angry than grieved at Mercy's fate. Mother
says she turns to ice at the slightest mention of the
girl's name. Don't you think love would show
itself differently ? "

One can never be sure about other people's
sentiments. Love has many languages."

Their talk drifted to more common-place subjects.
And then Theodore rose to take leave.

"You must dine at the Priory before your holiday
is over, Theoo," said his cousin, as they shook hands.
"Let me see  tomorrow will be Christmas Day 

will you come the day after, and bring the sisters ?
It is too long a drive for a winter night, so you must
stay, there is plenty of room."

Are you sure we shall not bore you ? "
"lam sure you will cheer me. My sister-in-law
is very good  but Lady Jane is the only person in
this house of whom I do not get desperately tired,
including myself," she added, with a sigh. " Please
say you will come, and I will order your rooms."
We will come then. Good night, Juanita."
The shadows were falling as he drove away, after
refusing tea in the drawing-room and a further
acquaintance with the wonderful children.

He looked forward to that evening at the Priory
with an eager expectancy that he knew to be supreme
foolishness, and when the evening came, it brought
some measure of disappointment with it. Juanita
was not so well as she had been upon Christmas
Eve. She was not able to dine downstairs, and the
family dinner, at which the Etonian Tom, Johnnie,
and Lucy were allowed to take their places in
virtue of Christmas time, was a dull business for
Theodore. His only pleasure was in the fact that
he sat on Lady Jane's right hand, and was able to

talk with her of Juanita. Even that pleasure was
alloyed with keenest pain ; for Lady Jane's talk
was of that dead love which cast its shadow over
Juanita's youth, or of that dim and dawning hope
which might brighten the coming days  and neither
in the love of the past nor in the love of the future
had Theodore any part. Juanita was on her sofa by
the drawing-room fire when he and Mr. Grenville
left the dining-room, after a single glass of claret,
and a brief review of the political situation. Theodore's
sisters were established on each side of her.
There was no chance for him while they were
absorbing her attention, and he retired disconsolately
to the group in the middle of the room, where
Mrs. Grenville and Lady Jane were seated on a
capacious ottoman with the children about them.

Johnnie and Lucy, who had over-eaten themselves,
were disposed to be quiet, the little girl leaning her
fair curls and fat shining cheek against her grandmother's
shoulder with an air that looked touching,
but which really indicated repletion ; Johnnie sprawling
on the carpet at his mother's feet, and wishing he
had not eaten that mince-pie, telling himself that,
on the whole, he hated mince-pie, and envying his

brother Tom, who had stolen off to the saddle-room
to talk to the grooms. Godolphin and Mabel
having dined early, were full of exuberance,
waiting to be "jumped," which entertainment
Theodore had to provide without intermission for
nearly half-an-hour, upheaving first one and then
another towards the ceiling, first a rosy bundle in
ruby velvet, and then a rosy bundle in white muslin,
laughing, screaming, enraptured, to be caught in
his arms, and set carefully on the ground, there to
await the next turn. Theodore slaved at this
recreation until his arms ached, casting a furtive
glance every now and then at the corner by the fireplace
where his sisters were treating Juanita to the
result of their latest heavy reading.

At last, to his delight, Lucy recovered from her comatose
condition, and began to thirst for amusement.

Let's have magic music," she said, " we can all
play at that, Granny and all. You know you love
magic music, Granny. Who'll play the piano ?
Not mother, she plays so badly," added the darling,
with child-like candour.

Sophy shall play for you," cried Theodore,
she's a capital hand at it."

He went over to his sister.

Go and play for the children, Sophy," he said.
I've been doing my duty. Go and do yours."

Sophy looked agonised, but complied ; and he
slipped into her vacant seat.

He sat by his cousin's side for nearly an hour,
while the children, mother, and grandmother played
their nursery game to the sound of dance-music, now
low, now loud, neatly executed by Sophy's accurate
fingers. Their talk was of indifferent subjects, and
the lion's share of the conversation was enjoyed by
Janet ; but to Theodore it was bliss to be there, by his
cousin's side, within sound of her low melodious voice,
within touch of her tapering hand. Just to sit there,
and watch her face, and drink in the tones of her voice,
was enough. He asked no more from Fate, yet awhile.

He had a long talk with her in her own room next
morning before he went back to Dorchester, and the
talk was of that old subject which absorbed her
thoughts.

Be sure you find out all you can from my father,"
she said at parting.

Life at Cheriton Chase bore no impress of the

VOL. II. L

tragedy that had blighted Juanita's honeymoon.
There were no festivities this winter ; there was no
large house-party. There had been a few quiet
elderly, or middle-aged visitors during the shooting
season, and there had been some slaughter of those
pheasants which were wont to sit, ponderous and
sleepy as barn-doors fowls, upon the five-barred
gates, and post-and-rail fences of the Chase. But
even those sober guests  old friends of husband and
wife  had all departed, and the house was empty of
strangers when Theodore arrived there, in time
for dinner on New Year's Eve. Nothing could have
suited him better than this. He wanted to be
tete-astute with Lord Cheriton ; to glean all in the
way of counsel or reminiscence that might fall from
those wise lips.

If there is a man living who can teach me how to
get on in my profession it is James Dalbrook," he
said to himself, thinking of his cousin by that name
which he had so often heard his father use when
talking of old days.

Lady Cheriton greeted him affectionately, made him
sit by her in the library, where a richly-embroidered
Japanese screen made a cosy corner by the fireplace,

during the twenty minutes before dinner. She was
a handsome woman still, with that grand-looking
Spanish beauty which does not fade with youth,
and she was dressed to perfection in lustreless
black silk, relieved by the glitter of jet here and
there, and by the soft white crape kerchief, worn
a la Marie-Antoinette. There was not one thread
of grey in the rich black hair, piled in massive
plaits upon the prettily shaped head. Theodore
contemplated her with an almost worshipping
admiration. It was Juanita's face he saw in those
classic lines.

I want to have a good talk with you, Theoo,"
she said ; " there is no one else to whom I can
talk so freely now my poor Godfrey is gone. We
sit here of an evening, now, you see. The drawing-room
is only used when there are people in the
house, and even then I feel miserable there. I
cannot get his image out of my mind. Cheriton
insists that the room shall be used, that it shall not
be made a haunted room  and no doubt it is best
so  but one cannot forget such a tragedy as that."
I hope Juanita will forget some day."
Ah, that is what I try to hope. She is sol

2

young, at the very beginning of life, and it does
seem hard that all those hopes for which other
women live should be over and done with for her.
I wish I could believe in the power of Time to cure
her. I wish I could believe that she will be able to
love somebody else as she loved Godfrey. If she
does, I daresay it will be some new person who has
had nothing to do with her past life. I had been
in and out of love before I met James Dalbrook, but
the sight of him seemed like the beginning of a new
life. I felt as if it had been preordained that I was
to love him, and only him  that nothing else had
been real. Yes, Theodore," with a sigh, " you
may depend if ever she should care for anybody, it
will be a new person."

Very lucky for the new person, and rather hard
upon any one who happens to have loved her all
his life."

Is there any one  like that? "

I think you know there is, Lady Cheriton."

Yes, yes, my dear boy, I know," she answered
kindly, laying her soft hand upon his. " I won't
pretend not to know. I wish, with all my heart,
you could make her care for you, Theodore, a year

or two hence. You would be a good and true
husband to her, a kind father to Godfrey's child 
that fatherless child. Oh, Theodore, is it not sad
to think of the child who will never  not for one
brief hour  feel the touch of a father's hand, or
know the blessing of a father's love. Such a dead
blank where there should be warmth and life and
joy. We must wait, Theoo. "Who can dispose of the
future ? I shall be a happy woman if ever you can
tell me you have won the reward of a life's devotion."

"God bless you for your goodness to me," he
faltered, kissing the soft white hand, so like in form
and outline to Juanita's hand, only plumper and
more matronly.

They dined snugly, a cosy trio, in a small room
hung with genuine old Cordovan leather, and
adorned with Moorish crockery, a room which was
called her Ladyship's parlour, and which had been
one of Lord Cheriton's birthday gifts to his wife,
furnished and decorated during her absence at a
German spa. When Lady Cheriton left them the two
men turned their chairs towards the fire, lighted their
cigars, and settled themselves for an evening's talk.

The great lawyer was in one of his pleasantness

moods. He gave Theodore the benefit of his experience
as a stuff-gown, and did all that the advice
of a wise senior can do towards putting a tyro on
the right track.

You will have to bide your time," he said in
conclusion ; " it is a tedious business. You must
just sit in your chambers and read till your chance
comes. Always be there, that's the grand point.
Don't be out when Fortune knocks at your door.
She will come in a very insignificant shape on her
earlier visits  with a shabby little two guinea brief
in her hand ; but don't you let that shabby little
brief be carried to somebody else just because you
are out of the way. I suppose you are really fond
of the law."

Yes, I am very fond of my profession. It is
meat and drink to me."

Then you will get on. Any man of moderate
abilities is bound to succeed in any profession which
he loves with a heart-whole love ; and your abilities
are much better than moderate."

There was a little pause in the talk while Lord
Cheriton threw on a fresh log and lighted a second
cigar.

I have been meditating a good deal upon Sir
Godfrey's murder," said Theodore, " and I am perplexed
by the utter darkness which surrounds the
murderer and his motive. Xo doubt you have
some theory upon the subject."

No, I have no theory. There is really nothing
upon which to build a theory. Churton, the detective,
talked about a vendetta  suggested poacher,
tenant, tramp, gipsy, any member of the dangerous
classes who might happen to consider himself
aggrieved by poor Godfrey. He even went so far as
to make a very unpleasant suggestion, and urged
that there might be a woman at the bottom of
the business, speculated upon some youthful
intrigue of Godfrey's. Now, from all I know of
that young man, I believe his life had been
blameless. He was the soul of honour. He
would never have dealt cruelly with any
woman."

"And you, Lord Cheriton," said Theodore,
hardly following the latter part of his cousin's
speech in his self-absorption.

His kinsman started and looked at him indignantly.


"And you  in j T our capacity of judge, for
instance  have you never made a deadly foe ? "

Well, I suppose the men and women I have
sentenced have hardly loved me ; but I doubt if the
worst of them ever had any strong personal feeling
about me. They have taken me as a part of the
machinery of the law  of no more account than the
iron door of a cell or a beam of the scaffold."

Yet there have been instances of active malignity
 the assassination of Lord Mayo, for instance."

Oh, the assassin in that case was an Indian,
and a maniac. We live in a different latitude.
Besides, it is rather too far-fetched an idea to
suppose that a man would shoot my son-in-law in
order to avenge himself upon me."

The shot may have been fired under a misapprehension.
The figure seated reading in the
lamplight may have been mistaken for you."

The assassin must have been uncommonly
short-sighted to make such a mistake. I won't say
such a thing would be impossible, for experience
has taught me that there is nothing in this life too
strange to be true ; but it is too unlikely a notion
to dwell upon. Indeed, I think, Theodore, we

must dismiss this painful business from our minds.
If the mystery is ever to be cleared up it will be by
a fluke ; but even that seems to me a very remote
contingency. Have you not observed that if a
murderer is not caught within three months of his
crime he is hardly ever caught at all ? I might
almost say if he is not caught within one month.
Once let the scent cool and the chances are a
hundred to one in his favour."

Yet Juanita has set her heart upon seeing her
husband avenged."

Ah, that is where her Spanish blood shows
itself. An Englishwoman, pure and simple, would
think only of her sorrow. My poor girl hungers for
revenge. Providence may favour her, perhaps, but
I doubt it. The best thing that can happen to her
will be to forget her first husband, fine young fellow
as he was, and choose a second. It is horrible to
think that the rest of her life is to be a blank.
With her beauty and position she may look high.
I am obliged to be ambitious for my daughter, you
see, Theodore, since Heaven has not spared me a
son."

Theodore saw only too plainly that whatever

favour his hopes might have from soft-hearted Lady
Cheriton, his own kinsman, James Dalbrook, would
be against him. This mattered very little to him
at present, in the face of the lady's indifference.
One gleam of hope from Juanita herself would have
seemed more to him than all the favour of parents
or kindred. It was her hand that held his fate : it
was she alone who could make his life blessed.

New Year's Day was fine but frosty, a sharp, clear
day on which Cheriton Park looked loveliest, the
trees made fairy-like by the light rime, the long
stretches of turf touched with a silvery whiteness,
the distant copses and boundary of pine-trees half
hidden in a pale grey mist.

Theodore walked across the Park with Lady
Cheriton to the eleven o'clock service in the church
at the end of Cheriton village. It was nearly a mile
from the great house to the fine old fifteenth-century
church, but Lady Cheriton always walked
to church in decent weather, albeit her servants
were conveyed there luxuriously in a capacious
omnibus specially retained for their use. On the
way along the silent avenue Theodore told her of
his meeting with Miss Newton's protegee, and of

Juanita's idea that the woman called Marian might
be no other than Mercy Porter.

I certainly remember no other case of a girl
about here leaving her home under disgraceful circumstances
 that is to say, any girl of refinement
and education," said Lady Cheriton. " There have
been cases among the villagers, no doubt ; but if
this girl of yours is really a superior person, and
really comes from Cheriton, I think Juanita is right,
and that you must have stumbled upon Mercy
Porter. Her mother ought to be told about it, without
delay."

Will you tell her, or will you put me in the
way of doing so ? "

Would you like to see Mrs. Porter ? "

"Yes. I feel interested in her, chiefly because
she may be Marian's mother. I shall have to go to
work very carefully, so as not to cause her too keen
a disappointment in the event of Juanita's guess
being wrong."

I do not know that you will find her very softhearted
where her daughter is concerned," replied
Lady Cheriton, thoughtfully. " I sometimes fear
that she has hardened herself against that unhappy

girl. The troubles of her own early life may have
hardened her, perhaps. It is not easy to bear a long
series of troubles with patience and gentleness.

Do you know much of her history ? "

Only that she lost her husband when she was
still a young woman, and that she was left to face
the world penniless with her young daughter. If
my husband had not happened to hear of her circumstances
Heaven knows what would have become
of her. He had been intimate with her husband
when he was a young man in London, and it seemed
to him a duty to do what he could for her ; so he
pensioned off an old gardener who used to live in
that pretty cottage, and he had the cottage thoroughly
renovated for Mrs. Porter. She had a little furniture
of a rather superior kind warehoused in London,
and with this she was able to make a snug and pretty
home for herself, as you will see if you call upon her
after the service. You are sure to see her at
church."

Was she very fond of her little girl in those
days ? "

I hardly know. People have different ways of
showing affection. She was very strict with poor

Mercy. She educated her at home, and never
allowed her to associate with any of the village children.
She kept the child entirely under her own
wing, so that the poor little thing had actually no
companion but her mother, a middle-aged woman,
saddened by trouble. I felt very sorry for the child,
and I used to have her up at the house for an afternoon
now and then, just to introduce some variety
into her life. "When she grew up into a beautiful
young woman her mother seemed to dislike these
visits, and stipulated that Mercy should only come
to see me when there were no visitors in the house.
She did not want her head turned by any of those
foolish compliments which frivolous people are so
fond of paying to a girl of that age, never thinking
of the mischief they may do. I told her that I
thought she was over-careful, and that as Mercy
must discover that she was handsome sooner or
later, it was just as well she should gain some experience
of life at once. Her instinctive self-respect
would teach her how to take care of herself; and if
she could be safe anywhere, she would be safe with
me. Mrs. Porter is a rather obstinate person, and
she took her own way. She kept Mercy as close as

if she had been an Oriental slave ; and yet, somehow,
Colonel Tremaine contrived to make love to
her, and tempted her away from her home. Perhaps
if that home had been a little less dismal the
girl might not have been so easily tempted."

They had left the park by this time and were nearing
the church. A scanty congregation came slowly
in after Lady Cheriton and her companion had taken
their seats in the chancel pew. The congregation
was chiefly feminine. Middle-aged women in everyday
bonnets and fur-trimmed cloaks, with their
shoulders up to their ears. Girls in felt hats and
smart, tight-fitting jackets. A few pious villagers of
advanced years, spectacled, feeble, with wrinkled
faces half hidden under poke bonnets : two representative
old men with long white hair and quavering
voices, whose shrill treble was distinguishable
above the rustic choir.

Amidst this sparse congregation Theodore had no
difficulty in discovering Mrs. Porter.

She sat in one of the front benches on the left
side of the aisle, which side was reserved for the
tradespeople and humbler inhabitants of Cheriton ;
while the benches on the right were occupied by the

county people, and some small fry who ranked with
those elect of the earth  with them, but not of
them  a retired banker and his wife, the village
doctor, the village lawyer, and two or three female
annuitants of good family.

A noticeable woman, this Mrs. Porter, anywhere.
She was tall and thin, straight as a dart, with strongly
marked features and white hair. Her complexion
was pale and sallow, the kind of skin which is
generally described as sickly. If she had ever been
handsome all traces of that former beauty had disappeared.
It was a hard face, without womanly
charm, yet with an unmistakable air of refinement.
She wore her neat little black straw bonnet and
black cloth mantle like a lady, and she walked like a
lady, as Theodore saw presently, when that portion
of the little band of worshippers which did not
remain for the celebration dribbled slowly out of
church.

He left Lady Cheriton kneeling in her pew, and
followed Mrs. Porter out of the porch and along the
village street, and thence into that rustic lane which
led to the West Lodge. He had spoken to her only
once in his life, on a summer morning, when he had

happened to find her standing at her garden gate,
and when it had been impossible for her to avoid
him. He knew that she must have seen him going
in and out of the park gates often enough for his
appearance to he familiar to her, so he had no scruple
in introducing himself.

Good morning, Mrs. Porter," he said, overtaking
her in the deeply sunk lane, between those
rocky hanks where harts-tongue and polygonum grew
so luxuriantly in summer, and where even in this
wintry season the lichens and mosses spread their
rich colouring over grey stone and brown earth, and
above which the snow-laden boughs showed white
against the blue brightness of the sky.

She turned and bowed stiffly.

Good morning, sir."

You haven't forgotten me, I hope. I am
Theodore Dalbrook, of Dorchester. I think you
must have seen me pass your window too often to
forget me easily ? "

I am not much given to watching the people
who pass in and out, sir. When his Lordship gave
me the cottage he was good enough to allow me a servant
to open the park gate, as he knew that I was

not strong enough to bear exposure to all kinds of
weather. I am free to live niy own life therefore,
without thinking of his Lordship's visitors'

I am sorry to intrude myself upon your notice,
Mrs. Porter, but I want to speak to you upon a very
delicate subject, and I must ask your forgiveness in
advance if I should touch upon an old wound."

She looked at him curiously, shrinkingly even,
with a latent anger in her pale eyes, eyes that had
been lovely once, perhaps, but which time or tears
had faded to a glassy dulness.

I have no desire to discuss old wounds with anyone,"
she said coldly. " My troubles at least are
my own."

'' Not altogether your own, Mrs. Porter. The
sorrow of which I am thinking involves another life
the life of one who has been dear to you,"

11 I have nothing to do with any other life."

Not even with the life of your only child '? "

Not even with the life of my only child," she
answered doggedly. " She left me of her own
accord, and I have done with her for ever. I stand
utterly alone in this world, utterly alone," she repeated.


VOL. II. m

And if I tell you that I think and believe I
have found your daughter in London  very poor 
working for her living, very sad and lonely, her
beauty faded, her life joyless  would you not wish to
know more  would not your heart yearn towards
her ? "

No ! I tell you I have done with her. She has
passed out of my life. I stand alone."

There was a tone of finality in these words which
left no room for argument.

Theodore lifted his hat, and walked on.

sovereign power of love ! O grief ! O balm !
All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,
And shadowy, through the mist of passed years."

Harrington Dalbrook, having iu a manner
given hostages to Fortune, entered upon his new
career with a strength of purpose and a resolute
industry which took his father by surprise.

Upon ruy word, Harry, I did not think there
was so much grit in you," said Mr. Dalbrook. "I
thought you and your sisters were too much stuffed
with modern culture to be capable of old-fashioned
work."

I hope, my dear father, you don't think education
and intellect out of place in a lawyer? "

Far from it. We have had too many examples
to the contrary, from Bacon to Brougham, from Hale
to Cockburn ; but I was afraid of the dilettante
spirit, the talk about books which you had only half

m 2

read, the smattering of subjects that need the work
of a lifetime to be properly understood. I was
afraid of our modern electro-plate culture  the process
which throws a brilliant film of education over
a foundation of ignorance. However, you have
surprised me, Harry. I own that I was disappointed
by your want of purpose at the University ; but I
begin to respect you now I find you attack your work
in the right spirit."

I want to get on," answered Harrington
gravely, hanging his head a little in shame at his
own reticence.

From so good a father he felt it was a kind of
dishonour to keep a secret; but Juliet Baldwin had
insisted upon secrecy, and the name of every fiancee
in the early stages of an engagement is 
obeyed.

Harrington said not a word, therefore, as to that
mighty prime-mover which was urging him to dogged
perseverance in a profession for which he had as yet
no real inclination. He put aside Darwin and
Spencer, Max Miller and Seeley, Schopenhauer and
Hermann, all those true or false lights which he
had followed through the mazes of free thought ;

and lie set himself to master the stern actualities of
the law. He had not done well at the University ;
not because he was wanting in brains, but because
he was wanting in concentration and doggedness.
The prime-mover being supplied, and of a prodigious
power, Harrington brought his intellectual forces to
bear upon a given point, and made a rapid advance
in legal knowledge and acumen. The old cook-housekeeper
complained of the coals and candles
which " Master Harry " consumed during his after-midnight
studies, and wondered that the household
were not all burnt in their beds by reason of the
young gentleman dropping off to sleep over Coke
upon Littleton. The sisters complained that they
had now practically no brother, since Harrington,
who had a pretty tenor voice, and had hitherto been
a star at afternoon teas and evening parties, refused
to go anywhere, except to those few houses  county
where Miss Baldwin might be met.

Scarcely had the New Year begun when Miss
Baldwin went off upon a visit to one of the largest
houses in Wiltshire, and one of the smartest, a
house under the dominion of a childless widow,
gifted with a large income and a sympathetic temperament,

a lady who allowed her life to be influenced
and directed by a family of nephews and nieces, and
whose house was declared by the advanced section
of society to be " quite the most perfect house to
stay in, don't you know."

Miss Baldwin did not leave the neighbourhood of
Dorchester and her lover without protestations of
regret. The thing was a bore, a sacrifice on her
part, butic must be done. She had promised dear
old Lady Burdenshaw ages ago, and to Lady Burdenshaw's
she must go.

You needn't worry about it," she said, with her
off-hand air, lolling on the billiard-room settee in
the grey winter afternoon, on the second Sunday of
the year ; "if you are at all keen upon being at
Medlow Court while I am there, I'll make dear old
Lady Burdenshaw send you an invitation."

You are very good," replied Harrington, " and
I should like staying in the same house with you ;
but I couldn't think of visiting a lady I don't know,
or of cadging for an invitation."

Sir Henry had asked his friend to luncheon, and
now, after a somewhat Spartan meal of roast mutton
and rice pudding, the lovers were alone in the bile

Sir Henry having crept off to the stables.
The table was 4 kept rigorously covered on Sundays,
in deference to the Dowager's Sabbatarian leanings ;
and there was nothing for her son to do in the
billiard-room, except to walk listlessly up and down
and stare at some very dingy examples of the early
Italian school, or to take the cues out of the rack
one by one to see which of them wanted topping.

Oh, but you needn't mind. You would be
capital friends with Lady B. We all call her Lady B.,
because a three syllable-name is too much for anybody's
patience. I tell her she ought to drop a
syllable. Lady Bur'shaw would do just as well. I
suppose though if I were to get an invitation you
could hardly be spared from  the shop," concluded
Juliet, with a laugh.

"Hardly. I have to stick very close to  the
shop," replied Harrington, blushing a little at the
word. "Remember what I am working for  a
family practice in London and a house that you need
not be ashamed to inhabit. To me that means as
much as the red ribbon of the Bath means to a
soldier or sailor. My ambition goes no further,
unless it were to a seat in Parliament later on."

You are a good earnest soul. Yes, of course,
you must go into Parliament. In spite of all the
riff-raff that has got into the House of late years,
boys, Home Rulers, city-men, there is a faint flavour
of distinction in the letters M.P. after a man's
name. It helps him just a little in society to be
able to talk about ' my constituents,' and to contemplate
European politics from the standpoint of
the town that has elected him. Yes, you must be
in the House, by-and-bye, Harry."

You told me you were tired of country house
visiting," said Harrington, who for the first time
since his betrothal felt somewhat inclined to quarrel
with his divinity.

So I am, heartily sick of it ; and I shall rejoice
when I have a snug little nest of my own in Charges
or Hertford Street. But you must admit that Med-low
Court is better than this house. Behold our
average Sunday ! Roast mutton  rice pudding 
and invincible dulness ; all the servants except an
under-footman gone to afternoon church, and no
possibility of a cup of tea till nearly six o'clock.
A cold dinner at eight, and family prayers at
ten."

What kind of a Sunday do you have at Med-low?"


u II yen a pour tons les goats. Medlow is liberty
hall. If we were even to take it into our heads to
have family prayers Lady Burdenshaw would send
for her chaplain  pluck him out of the bosom of
his family  and order him to read them. She
doesn't like cards on a Sunday, because of the servants
; but after the clock has struck eleven we may
do what we please  play poker, nap, euchre, baccarat,
till daylight, if we are in the humour. The billiard
and smoke rooms, and the ball-room are at one end
of the house, ever so far from the servants' quarters.
We can have as much fun as we like while those
rustic souls are snoring."

Harrington sighed ever so faintly. This picture
of a fashionable interior was perfectly innocent, and
his betrothed's way of looking at things meant
nothing worse than girlish exuberance, fine animal
spirits : but the sans gene of Medlow Court was
hardly the kind of training he would have chosen for
his future wife. And then he looked at the handsome
profile, the piled-up mass of ruddy-brown hair
on the top of the haughtily poised head, the perfectly

fitting tailor gown, with its aristocratic simplicity,
costing so much more than plebeian silks and
satins ; and he told himself that he was privileged
in having won such exalted beauty to ally itself with
his humble fortunes. Such a girl would shine as a
duchess ; and if marriageable dukes had eyes to see
with, and judgment to guide their choice, that lovely
auburn head would ere now have been crowned with
a tiara of family diamonds instead of waiting for
the poor sprigs of orange blossom which alone may
adorn the brow of the solicitor's bride.

Shall we go for a stroll in the grounds ? " asked
Juliet, with a restless air, and an impatient shiver.
Perhaps it will be warmer out of doors than it is
here. We keep such miserable fires in this house.
I believe the grates were chosen with a view to
burning the minimum of coal."

I shall be delighted."

Laura was absent on a visit to Yorkshire cousins,
strong-minded like herself, and with no pretensions
to fashion. Lady Baldwin had retired for her afternoon
siesta. On Sundays she always read herself to
sleep with Taylor or South ; on week-days she
nodded over the morning paper. She had gone to

the morning-room with the idea that Henry would
take his friend to the stables, and that Juliet would
require no looking after. It had never entered into
her ladyship's head that her handsome daughter
would look so low as the son of her solicitor. Juliet
was therefore free to do what she pleased with her
afternoon, and her pleasure was to walk in the chilly
shrubberies, and the bare grey park, sparsely timbered,
and with about as little forestal beauty as a
gentleman's park can possess.

She put on an old seal-skin jacket and a toque to
match, which she kept in the room where her
brother kept his overcoats, and which smelt of
tobacco, after the manner of everything that came
within Sir Henry's influence. And then she led
the way to a half-glass door, which opened on a
grass-plot at the side of the house, and she and her
lover went out.

"You can smoke if you like," she said. "You
know I don't mind. I'll have a cigarette with you
in the shrubbery."

Dearest Juliet, I can't tell you how glad I should
be if you would smoke  less," he said nervously,
blushing at his own earnestness.

You think I smoke too many cigarettes  that
they are really bad for me ? " she asked carelessly.

"It isn't that. I wasn't thinking about their
effect on your health ; but  I know you will call it
old-fashioned nonsense  I can't bear to see the
woman who is to be my wife with a cigarette
between her lips."

And when I am your wife, I suppose you will
cut me off from tobacco altogether."

"I should never be a domestic tyrant, Juliet 
but it would wound me to see my wife smoke, just
as much as it wounds me now when I see you smoke
half-a-dozen cigarettes in succession."

What a Philistine you are, Harry ! Well, you
shall not be tortured. I'll ease off the smoking if
I can  but a whiff or two of an Egyptian soothes
me when my nerves are overstrained. You are as
bad as my mother, who thinks cigarette smoking
one stage on the road to perdition, and rather an
advanced stage, too. You are very easily shocked,
Harry, if an innocent little cigarette can shock
you. I wonder if you are really fond of me, now
the novelty of our engagement has worn off? "

"lam fonder of you every day I live."

Enthusiastic boy ! If that is true you may be
able to stand a worse shocked than my poor little
cigarette."

Harrington turned pale, but he took the hand
which she held out to him, and grasped it firmly.
What was she going to tell him ?

Harry, I want to make a financial statement.
I want you to help me if you can. I am up to my
eyes in debt."
"In debt?"

Yes. It sounds bad, don't it ? Debt and
tobacco should be exclusively masculine vices. I
owe money all round  not large sums  but the
sum-total is large. I have had to hold my own in
smart houses upon an allowance which some women
would spend with their shoemaker. My mother
gives me a hundred and twenty-five pounds a year
for everything, tips, travelling expenses, clothes,
music  and I am not going to say anything unkind
about her on that score, for I don't see how she
could give me more. Her own means come to
something under eighteen hundred a year, and she
has this place to keep up. Henry takes all the
rents, and often keeps her waiting for her income,

which is a first charge upon the estate. If it were
not for your father, who looks after her interests as
sharply as he can, she might fare much worse.
Henry brings as many men as he likes here, and
Contributes nothing to the housekeeping."

And you owe money to milliners and people ? "
said Harrington, deeply distressed by his sweetheart's
humiliation, which he felt more keenly than
the lady herself.

Juliet had lived among girls who talked freely of
their debts and difficulties, of sops to Cerberus, and
getting round an unwilling dressmaker. Harrington's
lines had been set among old-fashioned
countrified people, to whom debt  and especially
feminine indebtedness  meant disgrace. He had
come back from the University feeling like a murderer,
because he had exceeded his allowance.

Milliners, dressmakers, shoemakers, hatters 
and ever so many more. I am afraid I have been
rather reckless  only  I thought "

I thought I should make a great match," she
would have said, had she followed her idea to its
close, but she checked herself abruptly, and cut offa
sprig of yew with a swing of the stick she carried.

If I can help you in any way " began Harrington.


My dear boy, there is only one way in which
you can help me. Lend me any money 3-ou can
spare, say fifty pounds, and I will give it you back
by instalments of ten or fifteen pounds a quarter.
It would be mockery for me to pretend I could pay
you in a lump sum, now I have told you the extent
of my income."

Harrington's worldly wealth at that moment was
something under fifty pounds. His father had given
him a cheque for fifty on Christmas Eve, and he
had no right to expect anything more till Lady Day ;
while he had to think of the black horse who was
steadily eating his head off at livery, and for whom
nothing had been paid as yet.

He could not find it in his heart to tell his
affianced that he was, comparatively speaking, a
pauper. He knew that his father had the reputation
of wealth, a man always ready to invest in any
odd parcel of land that was in the market, and who
was known to possess a good many small holdings
and houses in his native town and its neighbourhood.
Could he tell her that her future husband

was still in leading strings, and that the run of his
teeth and fifty pounds a quarter were all he could
count upon till he was out of his articles ? No, he
would rather perish than reveal these despicable
facts ; so, although he had only forty-three pounds
odd in his little cash-box, he told her that he would
let her have fifty pounds in a day or two.

If you could manage to bring it me tomorrow
I should be very glad," said Juliet, who, once having
broken the ice, talked about the loan with easy
frankness. "I must have a new frock for the ball
at Medlow. They are to have a ball on the first of
February, the ball of the year. There will be no
end of smart people. I want to send Estella Dawson
thirty-five or forty pounds, about half the
amount of her last bill. It's a paltry business altogether.
I know girls who owe their dressmakers
hundreds where I owe tens. Let me have the cash
tomorrow if you can, there's a dear. Miss Dawson
is sure to be full of work for the country at this
season, and she won't make my frock unless I give
her a week's notice."

' Of course, dear, yes, you shall have the
money," Harrington answered nervously; "but

your white gown at our ball looked lovely. Why
shouldn't you wear that at Medlow ? ' '

"My white gown would be better described as
black," retorted the young lady with marked acidity.
If I didn't hate the Dorchester people like poison
I wouldn't have insulted them by wearing such a
rag. I would no more appear in it at Medlow than
I would cut my throat."

Language so strong as this forbade argument.
Harrington concluded that there was a mystery in
these things outside the limits of masculine understanding.
To his eye the white satin and tulle his
betrothed had worn had seemed faultless ; ! but it
may be that the glamour of first love acts like limelight
upon a soiled white garment ; and no doubt
Miss Baldwin's gown had seen service.

He walked back to the house with her, and left
her at the door just as it was growing dusk, and the
servants were coming home from church. He left
her with a fictitious appearance of cheerfulness,
promising to go to tea on the following afternoon.

He was glad of the six-mile walk to Dorchester,
as it gave him solitude for deliberation. At home
the keen eyes of his sisters would be upon him,
VOL. II. N

and he would be pestered by inquiries as to what
there had been for lunch and what Miss Baldwin
wore ; while the still more penetrating gaze of his
father would be quick to perceive anything amiss.

Oh, Juliet, if you knew how hard you are
making our engagement to me," he ejaculated
mentally, as he walked, with the unconscious hurry
of an agitated mind, along the frost-bound road.

There had been a hard frost since Christmas, and
hunting had been out of the question, whereby the
existence of Mahmud, and the bill at the livery
stable seemed so much the heavier a burden.

Somehow or other he must get the difference
between forty-three pounds and fifty, only seven
pounds, a paltry sum, no doubt ; but it would
hardly do for him to leave himself penniless until
Lady-day. He might be called on at any moment
for small sums. Short of shamming illness and
stopping in bed till the end of the quarter, he could
not possibly escape the daily calls which every young
man has upon his purse. He told himself, therefore,
that he must contrive to borrow fifteen or
twenty pounds. But of whom ? That was the
question.

His first thought was naturally of his brother 
but in the next moment he remembered how Theodore
in his financial arrangements with his father
had insisted upon cutting himself down to the very
lowest possible allowance.

"You will pay all my fees, Dad, and give me
enough money to furnish my chambers decently,
with the help of the things I am to have out of this
house, and you will allow me so much," he said,
naming a very modest sum, " for maintenance till I
begin to get briefs. I want to feel the spur of
poverty. I want to work for my bread. Of course
I know I have a court of appeal here if my exchequer
should run dry."

Remembering this, Harrington felt that he could
not, at the very beginning of things, pester his
brother for a loan. The same court of appeal, the
father's well-filled purse, was open to him, but he
had no excuse to offer, no reason to give, for exceeding
his allowance.

He might sell Mahmud, if there were not two obstacles
to that transaction. The first that nobody in
the neighbourhood wanted to buy him, the second
that he was not yet paid for, except by that bill

n 2

which rose like a pale blue spectre before the young
man's eyes as he was dropping off to sleep of a
night, and sometimes spoiled his rest. He would
have to sell Mahmud in order not to dishonour that
bill ; and if the horse should fetch considerably less
than the price given for him, as all equine experience
led his owner to fear, whence was to come the
difference ? That was a problem which would have
to be solved somehow before the tenth of March.
He would have to send the beast to Tattersall's most
likely, the common experience of the hunting field
having taught him that nobody ever sells a horse
among his own circle. He saw himself realising
something under fifty pounds as the price of the
black, and having to bridge over the distance between
that amount and eighty, as best he might.
But March was not tomorrow, and he had first
of all to provide for tomorrow ; a mere trifle,
but it would have to be borrowed, and the
sensation of borrowing w T as new to Matthew
Dalbrook's son. He had frittered away his
ready money at the University, and he had got
into debt ; but he had never borrowed money
of Jew or Gentile. And now the time had

come when he must borrow of whomsoever he
could.

He took tea with his sisters in the good, homely,
old-fashioned drawing-room, which was at its best
in winter ; the four tall, narrow windows closely
curtained, a roaring fire in the wide iron grate, and
a modern Japanese tea table wheeled in front of it.
Five o'clock tea was of a more substantial order on
Sundays than on week days, on account of the
nine o'clock supper which took the place of
the seven o'clock dinner, and accommodated
those who cared to attend evening church. Lady
Baldwin's Spartan luncheon had not indisposed
her guest for cake and muffins, and basking in
the glow of the fire Harrington forgot his troubles,
enjoyed his tea, and maintained a very fair appearance
of cheerfulness while his sisters questioned
and his father put in an occasional
word.

I'm afraid you are getting rather too friendly at
the Mount," said Matthew Dalbrook. "I don't
like Sir Henry Baldwin, and I don't think he's an
advantageous friend for you."

Oh, but we're old chums," said Harrington,

blushing a little ; "we were at Oxford together, you
know."

I'm afraid we both know it, Harry, and to our
cost," replied his father. " You might have succeeded
in your divinity exam, if it hadn't been for
this fine gentleman friend of yours."

I'm not sorry I failed, father. The law suits
me ever so much better than the Church."

So long as you stick to that opinion I'm satisfied.
Only don't go to the Mount too often, and
don't let the handsome Miss Baldwin make a fool of
you."

If it had not been for the coloured shades over
the lamps, which were so artistic as to be useless for
seeing purposes, Harrington might have been seen
to turn pale.

No fear of that," Sophia exclaimed, contemptuously.
" Juliet Baldwin is not likely to give a
provincial solicitor any encouragement. She's a girl
who expects to marry for position, and though she is
just a shade passee she may make a good match
even yet. She comes here because she likes us,
but she's a thorough woman of the world, and you
needn't be afraid of her running after Harry."

Harrington grew as red as a peony with suppressed
indignation.

"Perhaps as the Baldwin' are my friends you
might be able to get on without talking any more
about them," he said, scowling at his elder sister.
"I've told you what we had for lunch, and how
many servants were in the room, and what kind of
gown Juliet  Miss Baldwin  was wearing. Don't
you think we've had enough of them for to-night ? "

Quite enough, Harry, quite enough," said the
father. " By-the-by, did you read the Times leader
on Gladstone's last manifesto ? And where are
the Field and the Observer ? Bring me over a
lamp that I can see by, Sophy, my dear. Those
crimson lamp shades of yours suggest one of
Richardson's pictures, but they don't help me to
read my paper."

They're the beastliest things I ever saw," said
Harrington vindictively.

I'm sorry you don't like them," said Janet.
It was Juliet Baldwin who persuaded us to buy
them. She had seen some at Medlow Court, and she
raved about them."

Harrington went out of the room without another

word. How odious his sisters had become of late ;
yet while he was at Oxford they had regarded him
as an oracle, and he had found even sisterly appreciation
pleasant.

Tt was some time since he had attended evening
service, but on this particular evening he went
alone, not troubling to invite his sisters, who
were subject to an intermittent form of neuralgia
which often prevented their going to church in the
evening. To-night he avoided St. Peter's, in which
his father had seats, and went to the more remote
church of Dodington, where he had a pew all to
himself on this frosty winter night, except for one
well-behaved worshipper in the person of his father's
old and confidential clerk, James Hayfield, a constant
church-goer, who was punctual at every evening
service, whatever the weather. Harrington had
expected to see him there.

Hayfield sat modestly aloof at the further end of
the pew, but when the service was over the young
man took some pains to follow close upon the heels
of the grey-haired clerk, with shoulders bent by long-years
of desk-work, and respectable dark-blue
Chesterfield overcoat with velvet collar.

How do you do, Hayfield ? Isn't this rather a
sharp night for you to venture out in ? " said Harrington,
as they left the church porch.

"I'm a toughest customer, I thank you, Mr,
Harrington. It would take severer weather than
this to keep me away from the evening service.
I'm very fond of the evening service. A fine
sermon, sir, a fine, awakening sermon."

Magnificent, capital," exclaimed Harrington,
who hadn't heard two consecutive sentences, and
whose mind had been engaged upon arithmetical
problems of the most unpleasant kind. "It is uncommonly
cold though," he added, shivering. " I'll
walk round your way. It will be a little longer forme."


You're very good, Mr. Harrington, very good
indeed," said the old clerk, evidently touched by this
unusual condescension. Never till to-night had his
master's son offered to walk home from church with
him.

The old man's gratitude was more than Harrington
could stand. He could not take credit for kindly
condescension, when he knew himself intent upon
his own selfish ends.

THE DAY WILL COME.

"I'm afraid I'm not altogether disinterested in
seeking your company to-night, Hayfield," he
blurted out. " The fact is, I want to ask a favour
of you."

You may take it as granted, Mr. Harrington,"
answered the clerk cheerily, "provided the granting
of it lies within my power."

Oh, it's not a tremendous affair  in point of
fact it's only a small money matter. I'm exceeding
my allowance a little this quarter, hut I intend to
pull up next quarter ; and it will he a great convenience
to me in the meantime if you'll lend me
ten or fifteen pounds."

It was out at last. He had no idea until he
uttered the words how mean a creature the utterance
of them would make him seem to himself. There
are people who go through life borrowing, and who
do it with the easiest grace, seeming to confer
rather than to ask a favour. But perhaps even
with these gifted ones the first plunge was painful.

Fifteen or twenty, if you like, sir," replied Hay-field.
"I've got a few pounds in an old stocking,
and any little sum like that is freely at your service.
I know your father's son won't break his word or

forget that an old servant's savings are his only bulwark
against age and decay."

"My dear Hayfield, of course I shall repay you
next quarter, without fail."

Thank you, Mr. Harrington, I feel sure you will.
And if at the same time I may venture a word, as
an old man to a young one, in all friendliness and
respect, I would ask you to beware of horses. I
heard some one let drop the other evening in the
billiard-room at the ' Antelope,' where I occasionally
play a fifty, I heard it said, promiscuously, that
Sir Henry Baldwin is a better hand at selling a horse
than you are at buying one."

That's bosh, Hayfield, and people in a God-forsaken
town like Dorchester will always talk bosh
especially in a public billiard-room. The horse is
a good horse, and I shall come home upon him
when I send him up to Tattersall's after the hunting."



I only hope he won't come home upon you,
sir. You'd better not put a high reserve upon him
if you don't want to see him again. I used to be
considered a pretty good judge of a horse in my
time. I never was an equestrian, but one sees

more of a horse from the pavement than when one
is on his back."

Harrington felt that he must hear with this twaddle
for the sake of the twenty pounds which would
enable him to lend Juliet a round fifty, and would
thereby enable Juliet to go to Medlow Court and
flirt with unknown men, and forget him upon whom
her impecuniosity was inflicting such humiliation.
After all love is only another name for suffering.

Mr. Hayfield lived in West-walk terrace, where
he had a neat first floor in a stucco villa, semi-detached,
and built at a period when villas strove to
be architectural without attaining beauty. The
first floor consisted of a front sitting-room, looking
out upon the alley of sycamores and the green
beyond, and a back bedroom, looking over gardens
and houses, towards the church-tower in the heart
of the town.

Provided with a latch-key, Mr. Hayfield admitted
his master's son to the inner mysteries of the villa,
where a lady with a very reedy voice was singing
"Far away," in the front parlour, while a family
conversation which almost drowned her melody was
going on in the back parlour. Mr. Hayfield's bedroom

candlestick and matches were ready for him on
a Swiss bracket near his door, and his lamp was
ready on a table in his sitting-room, where every
object was disposed with a studied precision which
marked at once the confirmed bachelor and the
model lodger. " The Pilgrim's Progress," " The
Christian Year," " TAliittaker' s Almanac," and
Uncle Tom's Cabin," were placed with mathematical
regularity upon the walnut loo table, surrounding
a centrepiece of wax flowers in an alabaster
vase under a glass shade. A smaller table of the
nature described as Pembroke was placed nearer the
fire, and on this appeared Mr. Hayfield's supper
tray, set forth with a plate of cold roast beef, a glass
saucer of Oriental pickle, cheese, and accompaniments,
flanked by an Imperial pint of Guinness'.
A small fire burned brightly in the grate, whose
dimensions had been reduced by a careful adjustment
of fire bricks.

Sit down, my dear Mr. Harrington, you'll find
that chair very comfortable. I'll go and get you
the money. My cash box is in the next room. Can
I tempt you to join me in a plate of cold ribs ?
There's plenty more where that came from. Mrs.

Potter Las a fine wing rib every Sunday, from year's
end to year's end. I generally take my dinner with
her and her family, but I sup alone. A little
society goes a long way with a man of my age. I
like my Lloyd and my News of the World after
supper."

He went into his bedroom, which was approached
by folding doors, and came back again in two
minutes with a couple of crisp notes, the savings of
half a year, savings which meant a good deal of self-denial
in a man who in his own words wished to live
like a gentleman. The old clerk prided himself
upon his good broadcloth, clean linen, and respectable
lodgings ; and it was felt in the town that so
respectable a servant enhanced even the respectability
of Dalbrook & Son.

Harrington took the bank-notes with many thanks,
and insisted upon writing a note of hand  albeit the
old clerk 1 reminded him that Sunday was a dies non 
at the desk where Hayfield wrote his letters and did
any copying work he cared to do after office hours.
He stayed while the old man ate his temperate meal,
but would not be persuaded to share it. Indeed,
his lips felt hot and dry, and it seemed to him as if

be should never want to eat again ; but be gladly
accepted a tumbler of the refreshing Guinness' upon
the repeated assurance that there was plenty more
where that came from.

There was a rapid thaw on the following morning,
so Harrington rode the black over to the Mount in
the twilight after office hours, a liberty which that
high-bred animal resented by taking fright at every
doubtful object in the long leafless avenue beyond
the Roman Amphitheatre.

Trifles which would have been light as air to him,
jogging homeward in company after a long day's
hunting, assumed awful and ghostly aspects under
the combined influences of solitude and want of
work. The twilight ride to the Mount was in fact a
series of hairbreadth escapes, and it would have
needed a stronger stimulant than the Dowager's
wishy-washy tea to restore Mr. Dalbrook's physical
balance, if his mental balance had not been so
thoroughly unhinged as to make him half unconscious
of physical discomfort.

You look awfully seedy," said Juliet, as she
poured out tea from a pot that had been standing
nearly half an hour.

The Dowager Lad retired to her own den, where
she occupied a great portion of her life in writing
prosy letters to her relatives and connections of all
degrees ; but as she never sent them anything else,
this was her only way of maintaining the glow of
family feeling.

The black nearly pulled my fingers off," replied
Harrington. " I never knew him so fresh."

You should have taken it out of him on the
downs," answered Juliet, rather contemptuously.
The grass is all right after the thaw. Have you
brought me what you so kindly promised ? "

He took a sealed envelope out of his breast-pocket
and handed it to her.

Is this the fifty ? How quite too good of you,"
she cried, pocketing it hastily. "You don't know
what a difficulty you have got me out of; but I'm
afraid I may have inconvenienced you."
This was evidently an after-thought.

'Being your slave, what should I do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire,' " quoted
Harrington, with a sentimental air.

How sweet ! " exclaimed Juliet, really touched
by his affection ; yet she would rather he had told

her that fifty pounds was a sum of no consequence,
and that so small a loan involved no inconvenience
for him.

I'm afraid his father can hardly be as rich as
people think," she said to herself, while Harrington
relaxed his strained muscles before the fire.

How I wish you were not going to Medlow," he
said presently.

"So do I ; but I can't possibly get out of it,
and then it's a blessed escape to get away from
here."

Do you really dislike your home ? " asked her
lover, wondering at this hitherto unknown characteristic
in a young woman.

I loathe it, and so does my sister, though she
pretends to be domestic and religious and all that
kind of thing. Lady Baldwin is an impossible
person, and our housekeeping would disgrace the
Union. If I had not had the entree of plenty of
good houses, and been in request, I should have
been found hanging in one of the attics years
ago."

This candour gave Harrington an uncomfortably
chilly feeling, as if a damp cold wind had blown over

VOL. II. o

him, and then he told himself that it would be his
privilege to initiate this dear girl in the tranquil
delights of a happy home, which, while modest in
its pretensions, should yet be smart enough to satisfy
her superior tastes and aspirations.

When do you go?" he asked, preparing to take
leave.

To-morrow. Your kindness has made everything
easy to me."

Come back as soon as you can, love ; " and then
there was some lingering foolishness permissible between
engaged lovers, and the beautiful Miss Baldwin's
head reposed for two or three minutes upon
the articled clerk's shoulder, while he looked into
her eyes and told her that they were stars to light
him on to fame and fortune.

"I hope they'll show you a short cut," she said.

He left her cheered by the thought that she was
very fond of him ; and so she was, but he was not
the first, second, third, or fourth young man of
whom she had been fond, nor was it a new thing to
her to be told that her eyes were guiding stars.

"All the creatures
Made for Heaven's honours, have their ends, and good ones,
All but the cozening crocodiles, false women."

February had begun, the frost and snow had disappeared.
There were soft breathing of spring in
the breezes that blew over the broad grassy downs
beyond the Woman encampment, and the sportsmen
of the neighbourhood were rejoicing in open weather
and lengthening daylight ; but Juliet Baldwin was
still at Medlow Court, and the heart of Harrington
Dalbrook was heavy as he set out in the pleasant
morning for some distant meet ; and it was heavier
as he rode home in the evening, after a day's sport
which had shown him only too distinctly that the
black horse was not so young as he had been. He
hugged himself with the delusion that those indications
of advancing years which were but too obvious
towards the close of a trying day across a heavy
country, would vanish after a week's rest, and that

o 2

the horse would show no signs of staleness at
Tattersall's, where he must inevitably be sold before
the end of the month, his owner seeing no other
way of meeting the bill that had been given in exchange
for a beast whose name should have been
not Mahmud, but White Elephant.

Harrington's sole motive for buying a hunter  or,

rather, his sole excuse for being trapped into the

purchase  was the expectation of being able to ride

to hounds in Miss Baldwin's company. She had

said to him " You ought to hunt," and he had

straightway hunted, just as, if she had told him

to balloon, he would have ballooned. And now

Juliet Baldwin was following the hounds in another

county while he was in Dorsetshire plodding along

dreary roads to inaccessible meets at places which

would seem to have been chosen with a special study

of everybody's inconvenience. The whole business

was fraught with bitterness. He had never loved

hunting for its own sake  had never possessed the

single-mindedness of the genuine sportsman, who

cares not for weather or country, or companionship,

or hunger or thirst, so long as there is a fox at the

beginning of the day and blood at the end.

Juliet was out with the hounds three days a week.
She wrote rapturous accounts of forty minutes here,
and an hour there ; and every run which she described
was apparently the quickest thing that had
ever been known in that country. She let her lover
know en passant that she had been greatly admired,
and that her horsemanship had been talked about.
Her letters were very affectionate, but they testified
also to a self-love that amounted to adoration. Her
frocks, her horses  provided, as the young ravens
are fed, by a kindly Providence in the shape of
casual acquaintance  her breaks at billiards, her
waltzing, were all dilated upon with a charming
frankness.

It seems rather foolish to write all this egotistical
twaddle," she apologised, " but you complain
if I send you a short letter, and there
is literally nothing to tell here at least nothing
about any one you know, or that would have the
faintest interest for you  so I am obliged to
scribble about my frocks and my little social
triumphs."

This was kindly meant, no doubt, but it stung
him to be reminded that his friends were not her

friends, that Belgravia is not further from Islington
than her people were from his people.

In one of her letters she wrote casually : 
Why don't you put Mahmud into a horse-box
and come over for a day with these hounds. It
would be capital fun. There is a dear little rustic
inn where you and your horse can put up  and
Lady B. would ask you to dinner as a matter of
course. I daresay your highly-respectable hair will
stand on end at some of our ways  but that won't
matter. I am sure you would enjoy an evening or
two at Medlow. Think about it, like a dear boy."

Harrington did think about it  indeed, from the
first reading of his lady-love's unceremonious invitation
he thought of nothing else. After much
puzzling over time-tables he found that trains  -
those particular trains which condescend, with an
asterisk, to carry horses  could be matched so as
to convey the black horse to the immediate vicinity
of Medlow Court in something under a day, and
this being so he telegraphed his intention of putting
up at the " Medlow Arms " on the following night,
taking pains to add " Shall arrive at five p.m," so
as to secure the promised invitation to dinner. He

had been so chary of spending money since his loan
to Juliet that he had still a few pounds in hand,
enough as he thought to pay travelling expenses and
hotel bills. His heart was almost light as he
packed his hunting-gear and dress suit, albeit March
10 was written in fiery characters across a spectral
bill which haunted him wherever he went.

It was still early in February he told himself.
Some stroke of luck might happen to him. Some
rich young fool at Medlow Court might take a fancy
to Mahmud and want to buy him. He had heard
of men who wanted to buy horses, although it had
been his fate to meet only the men who were eager
to sell.

After no less than three changes of trains he arrived
at the Templeton Road Station  for Medlow
and Templeton  about half-past four, weary, but
full of hope. He was to see her again  after three
weeks' severance. He was going at her own express
desire. It was her tact and cleverness that
had made the visit easy for him. Had he not Lady
Burdenshaw's invitation in his pocket, in a fine
open-hearted hand, sprawling over three sides of
large note-paper : 

Dear Mr. Dalbrook,  I hear you are coming
over for a day or two with our hounds, and I hope
you will contrive to dine with us every evening
while you are in the neighbourhood. Your father
and Sir Phillimore were old friends. Dinner at
eight.

Sincerely yours,

Sarah Burdenshaw."

Sir Phillimore had been in the family vault nearly
fifteen years. The malicious averred that he had
sought that dismal shelter as a refuge and a relief
from the life which Lady Burdenshaw imposed upon
him  open house, big shoots, hunting breakfasts,
fancy balls, and private theatricals in the country ;
and in London perpetual parties or perpetual gadding
about.

Sir Phillimore' s grandfather had come up from
Aberdeen, a raw boy without a penny, and had found
out something about the manufacture of iron which
had eventually made him a millionaire. Sir Fillmore's
fortune had reconciled the beautiful Sally
Tempest to a marriage with a man who was her
senior by a quarter of a century, and the only

license she had allowed herself had been her indulgence
in boundless extravagance, and a laxity of
manner which had somewhat shocked society in the
sober fifties and sixties, though it left her moral
character unimpeached.

In the eighths nobody wondered or exclaimed at
Lady Burdenshaw's freedom of speech and manner,
or at the manners she encouraged in her guests.
In the eighths Sarah Burdenshaw was generally described
as " good fun."

Harrington found the dear little rustic inn very
picturesque externally, but small and stuffy within,
and the bedroom into which he was ushered was
chiefly occupied by a large old-fashioned, four-post
bedstead, with chintz hangings that smelt of mildewed
lavender  indeed, the pervading odour of the
Medio w Arms " was mildew. He dressed as well
as he could under considerable disadvantages ; and
a rumbling old landau, which had the local odour,
conveyed him to Medlow Court much quicker than
he could have supposed possible from his casual
survey of the horse. It was ten minutes to eight
when he entered Lady Burdenshaw's drawing-room.


It was a very large room, prettily furnished in a
careless style, as if by a person whose heart was not
set upon furniture. There were plenty of low
luxurious chairs, covered with a rather gaudy chintz,
and refilled with lace and muslin, and there were
flowers in abundance ; but of human life the room
was empty.

Harrington hardly knew whether he was relieved
or discomposed at finding himself alone. He had
leisure in which to pace the room two or three times,
to arrange his tie and inspect his dress suit before
one of the long glasses, and then to feel offended at
Juliet's coldness. She knew that he was to be
there. She might surely have contrived to be in the
drawing-room ten minutes before the dinner hour.

Half a dozen people straggled in, a not too tidy-looking
matron in ruby velvet, a sharp-featured girl
in black lace, and some men who looked sporting or
military. One of these talked to him.

I think you must be Mr. Dalbrook," he said,
after they had discussed the weather and the state of
the roads.

You are quite right  but how did you guess ? "

Miss Baldwin told me you were coming, and I

don't think there's any one else expected to-night.
Do you know your hostess ? "

"lam waiting for that privilege."

"Ah ! that explains your punctuality. Nobody is
ever punctual at Medlow. Eight o'clock means half-past,
and sometimes a quarter to nine. Lady Burdenshaw
has reached her sixtieth year without
having arrived at a comprehension of the nature of
time, as an inelastic thing which will not stretch to
suit feminine convenience. She still believes in the
elasticity of an hour, and rushes off to her room to
dress when she ought to be sitting down to dinner.
Her girl friends follow her example, and seldom
leave the billiard-room or the tea-room till dear Lady
B. leads the way."

A whole bevy of ladies entered the room rather
noisily at this moment, and among them appeared
Juliet, magnificent in a red gown, which set off the
milky whiteness of her shoulders.

Rather a daring combination with red hair," remarked
the young lady in black, who was sitting on
a narrow causeuse with a large man, whose white
moustache and padded chest suggested a cavalry
regiment.

You may call the lady a harmony in red," said
the gentleman.

Harrington scowled upon these prattlers, and then
crossed the room to greet his love. Yes, it was a
daring combination, the scarlet gown with the ruddy
tints in her auburn hair : but the audacity was
justified by success. She looked a magnificent
creature, dazzling as Vashti in her Eastern splendour,
invincible as Dallas. Who could resist her?

She gave her hand to Harrington, and seemed
pleased to see him, but in the next moment he saw
her looking beyond him towards the end of the room.
He turned, involuntarily following the direction of
her eyes, and saw the man who had talked to him,
and who was now evidently watching them. He was
a middle-aged man, handsome, tall, and upstanding,
and with an air which Harrington considered
decidedly patrician.

Who is that man by the piano ? " he asked.

Major Svvanwick, Lord Beauties's younger
brother."

Ah, I thought he was a swell," said Harrington,
innocently. " He was very civil to me just now.
You might have been in the drawing-room a little

earlier, Juliet. You must have known that I was
longing to see you."

My dear boy, we were playing skittle-pool till
five minutes to eight. I had no idea you were in
the house. Ah, here comes Lady B."

A fat, fair, flaxen-haired lady in a sky-blue tea-gown
embroidered with silver palm-leaves came
rolling into the room, murmuring apologies for
having kept people waiting for their dinner.

I know you must all be delightfully ravenous,"
she said; " and that's ever so much better than
feeling that dinner has come too soon after lunch."
Juliet introduced her friend, who was most
graciously received.

How is your father ? " asked Lady Burden shaw.
"It is ages since I saw him  more than twenty
years I believe. Sir Phillimore bought some land
in your county, and Mr. Dalbrook acted for him in
the matter, and he still receives the rents. And so
you are going out with the hounds tomorrow ?
They meet quite near  not more than seven or eight
miles from your inn. Juliet will show you the way
across country. She's always in the first flight ;
but if you want to know her particular talent you

should see her play pool. I can assure you she
makes ail the men sit up."

Harrington scarcely followed the lady's meaning.
There was no time for explanations, as the butler,
who had been waiting for her Ladyship's appearance,
now announced dinner, and Harrington had the bliss
of going to the dining-room with Juliet Baldwin on
his arm. He felt as if he were in the Moslem's enchanted
fields as he sat by her side at the brilliant
table, with its almost overpowering perfume of hothouse
flowers, which were grouped in great masses
of bloom among the old silver and the many-coloured
Venetian glass. Yes, it was a Mohammedan
paradise, and this was the houri, this lovely
creature with the milky shoulders rising out of soft
folds of scarlet crape.

How long are you going to stay here, Juliet ? "
he asked, as the houri unfolded her napkin.

She gave a little laugh before she answered the
question.

Compare this room and table with our diningroom
at the Mount  you can compare the dinner
with my mother's dinners after you have eaten it 
and ask yourself if any reasonable creature would

be in a hurry to leave this Canaan for that wilderness.
I'm afraid I shall stop as long as ever dear
old Lady B. asks me ; and she is always pressing
me to extend my visit."

I don't think dinner can be much of attraction
in your mind, Juliet," said Harrington.

Of course not  girls don't care what they eat,"
replied Juliet, sipping her clear soup, and most fully
appreciating the flavour. "But there are so many
advantages at Medlow. There is the hunting, for
instance, which is much better than any I can get at
home, where I have positively no horse that I can
call my own. Here I can always rely upon a good
mount."

Has Lady Burdenshaw a large stable ? "

Oh, she keeps a good many horses ; but most
of hers are only lit for leather. There are men who
come here with strings of hunters, and have always
a young one that they like me to handle for them."

"Juliet, you will get your neck broken," cried
Harrington, pale with horror, and staring vacantly at
the fish that was being offered to him.

There is no fear of that while I ride young
horses, the danger is an old one. My father taught

me to ride, and as he was one of the best cross-country
riders in Dorset I am not likely to make a
mistake. You had better try that sole Normande ;
it is one of the Medlow specialities."

Juliet, I hate the idea of your staying in this
house  or in any house where there is a crowd of
fast men. I hate the idea of your riding men's
horses  of your being under an obligation to a
stranger "

"Don't I tell you that the obligation is all the
other way. A young hunter is a more saleable
article when he has carried a lady. ' Will suit a
bold horsewoman in a stiff country.' That sort of
thing is worth a great deal in a catalogue, and the
men whose horses I ride are not strangers."

At the most they are casual acquaintances."

Call them that if you like. Why should not
one profit by one's acquaintances ? "

There is one of your benefactors looking at you
at this moment, and looking as if he objected to my
talking to you."

How dare you talk about my benefactors ? Do
you suppose I had you invited to Medlow in order
that you might insult me ? "

This little dialogue was conducted in subdued
tones, but with a good deal of acrimony upon either
side. Harrington was bursting with jealousy.

The house, the men, the very atmosphere
awakened distrust. He detested those men for their
square shoulders and soldierly bearing, for the
suggestion of cavalry or household brigade which
seemed to him to pervade the masculine portion of
the assembly. He had always hated military men.
Their chief mission in life seemed to be to make
civilians look insignificant.

Miss Baldwin ate the next entree in stony silence,
and it was not till he had abjectly apologised for his
offensive speech that her lover was again taken into
favour. She relented at last, however, and favoured
him with a good deal of information about thejuouse
party which made such a brilliant show at Lady
Burdenshaw's luxurious board.

The men were for the most part military  the
greater number bachelors, or at any rate unencumbered
with wives. Two had been divorced, one
was a widower, another was separated in the friendliest
way from a wife who found she could live in
better style unfettered by matrimonial supervision.

VOL. II. p

Major Swanwick was one of the two who had
profited by Sir James Hannen's jurisdiction.

His wife was Lady Flora Charles, one of the
Pantaloons. All the Tantallan girls went wrong,
don't you know. It was in the blood."

You and he seem to be great friends," said
Harrington, still suspicious.

Oh, we have met very often ; he is quite an old
chum of mine. He is a good old thing."

Seeing that the good old thing looked as if he
were well under forty, Harrington was not altogether
reassured, even by this comfortable tone. He
watched his betrothed and the Major all through the
long evening in the billiard-room, where pool was
again the chief amusement of a very noisy party,
of which Juliet and Major Swanwick seemed to him
the ringleaders and master spirits. It was with
difficulty that he, the affianced, got speech with his
betrothed.

There were just a few minutes, while the old
family tankards were being carried round with
mulled claret and other cunning drinks, in which
Juliet vouchsafed to give her attention to her lover,
he having in a manner cornered her into a draped

recess at the end of the room, where he held her
prisoner while he bade her good night.

I shall see you at the meet tomorrow," he said.

I won't promise to be at the meet, but I shall
find you and the hounds in plenty of time. I know
every inch of this country."

Whose horse are you going to ride tomorrow
? "

"A fine upstanding chestnut; I'm sure you'll
admire him ? *

Yes, yes, but whose ? "

"Whose?" echoed Juliet, as if she scarcely
understood the word. " Oh," with a sudden flash
of intelligence; "you mean whose property is he?
As if that mattered ! He belongs to Major Swanwick."


Good night ! " said Harrington, and he went off
to take leave of Lady Burdenshaw, who was sitting
in the capacious ingle nook, with a circle of men
about her telling her anecdotes in Parisian French,
and from whom every now and then there burst peals
of jovial laughter.

11 At my age one understands everything, and one
may hear everything," said her Ladyship.

p 2

Harrington went back to the " Medlow Arms"
more depressed than he had felt during any period
of his courtship. Instinct had warned him of the
dangers that must lurk in such a house as Medlow
Court for such a girl as Juliet Baldwin ; but neither
instinct nor imagination had prepared him for the
horrible reality. To see the woman who was to be
his wife smoking cigarettes, playing shilling pool,
and bandying doubtful jokes with men who had
obviously the very poorest opinion of the opposite
sex, was an agony which he had never thought to
suffer ; and for the first time since his engagement
he asked himself whether it would not have been
better to have trusted his future happiness to the
most insipid and colourless of the girls with whom
he played tennis than to this magnificent specimen
of emancipated smartness. The image of Juliet
sprawling over the billiard-table, with her eyes on
fire and her shoulders half out of her gown as she
took a difficult " life," pursued him like a bacchanalian
nightmare all through his troubled snatches of sleep.
The stony straw mattrass and lumpy feather bed
would not have been conducive to slumber under the
happiest circumstances, but for a mind disturbed by

care they were a bed of torture. He rose at seven,
unrefreshed, heavy-hearted, detesting chanticleer,
cloudy skies, and all the old-fashioned fuss about a
hunting morning, and wishing himself in his comfortable
room in the good old house in Cornhill,
where he had ample space and all things needful to
a luxurious toilet. He got himself dressed somehow.
He was in the saddle at nine o'clock, after a
breakfast for which he had no appetite.

It was a long, dreary ride to the little roadside
inn at which the hounds met, and Harrington being
particularly punctual, had to jog along companionless
till the last mile, when Major Swanwick
and another man from Medlow overtook him and
regaled him with their talk for the rest of the
way.

"I think I know that black horse," said the
Major, who looked provokingly well in his red coat,
chimney pot, and cream-coloured tops, thereby
making Harrington ashamed of his neat dark gray
coat, Bedford cords, and bowler hat. " Wasn't hein
Baldwin's stud nine years ago ? "

I bought him of Sir Henry Baldwin."

Thought so. Good hand at selling a horse,

Baldwin ! However, I suppose there's some work in
the black horse yet."

"I hope so, for I mean to hunt him to the end
of the season," answered Harrington, ignoring that
awful necessity of selling before the end of the
month.

Hope glowed faintly in his breast as he saw the
Major's keen eye going over his mount, as if studying
the condition of every limb and every muscle.

Wears well," he said, after this deliberate survey,
" but I'm afraid you'll find him like the
wonderful one-horse shay. He'll go to pieces all at
once. Did Baldwin tell you his age ? ' '

He said something about rising eight  but I
didn't inquire very particularly, as I know the horse
is a good one."

And it was a good one of Baldwin to talk about
rising eight. He would have been within the mark
if he had said rising eighteen. I've bought a horse
of Sir Henry myself, and,"  after a brief pause 
I've sold him one."

And I daresay that made you even," said
Harrington, with acidity. He would have liked to
call the Major out for his insolence, and almost regretted

that be was a Briton, and not a Frenchman
and a professed duellist.

"Faith, I don't think he had altogether the best
of me  for when he rode that hunter of mine he
was like the little old woman in the nursery rhyme,
of whom it was said that she should have music
wherever she went. He had music, and to spare."

And so with jovial laughter they rode up to the
open space in front of the " Red Cow," where the
hounds were grouped about a duck pond, while the
master chatted with his friends.

It was an hour later before Juliet appeared, cropping
up suddenly on a windy common, with three
other girls and two men, while the hounds were
drawing the furze.

You see I could make a pretty good guess whereto
find you," she said to Harrington. "How well
the black looks ! You have been saving him up, I
suppose ? "

No, I've hunted as often as I could. I had no
other distraction during your absence."

How sweet of you to say that  with all the
gaieties of Dorchester to allure you ! Hark ! they've
found, and we shall be off in a minute. Y r es, there

he goes ! " pointing with her whip to the spot where
the fox had flashed across the short level sward,
vanishing next moment in the withered heather.
u Now you'll see what this horse can do, and you
can tell me what you think of him when we meet at
dinner."

There was the usual minute or so of flutter and
expectation, and then the business-like calm  an
almost awful calm  every man settling down to his
work, intent upon himself, steering carefully for a
good place.

Harrington was a nervous rider, and if fortune
helped him to get a good place he rarely kept it.
To-day he was more than usually nervous, fancying
that Juliet's eye was upon him, which it wasn't, and,
indeed, could not have been, unless it had been
situated in the back of her head, since she was already
ever so far in front.

In time, however, he, too, contrived to settle
down, and the black horse took the business into
his own hands, and kept his rider fairly close to the
hounds. For the first twenty minutes there was a
good deal of jumping, but of a mildish order, and
Harrington felt that he was distinguishing himself,

inasmuch as he was alle to stick to his horse, though
not always to his saddle.

They lost their first fox, after a very fair run, and
they waited about for nearly two hours before they
started a second, which they did eventually in a
scrubby copse on the skirts of a great stretch of
ploughed land.

The plough took a good deal out of Mahmud, and
after the plough came a series of small fields, with
some stiffish fences, which had to be taken by any
man who wanted to keep with the hounds. Here
Juliet was in her glory, for the chestnut on which
she was mounted was a fine fencer, and she knew
how to handle him, or, perhaps it may be said, how
to let him alone.

Mahmud had been almost as fine a fencer as the
fiery young chestnut, and he was a horse of a greatheart,
always ready to attempt more than he could
do. The livery stable people had told Harrington
that if his legs were only as good as his heart he
would be one of the best hunters in the county.
And now, with some quavering of spirit on his own
part, Harrington trusted that heart would stand instead
of legs, and get him and the black over the

fences somehow. Just at tins crucial point in the
run Juliet was in front of him, and Major Swanwick
was pressing him behind. He was near the
hounds, and altogether in a place of honour, could
he but keep it, and to keep it he felt was worth a
struggle.

He got over or through the first fence somehow ;
not gloriously, but without too much loss of time ;
and galloped gaily towards the second, which looked
a stiffer and more complicated affair. Juliet's horse
went over like a bird, and Juliet sat him like a
butterfly, no more discomposed by the shock than
if she had been some winged insect that had lighted
on his haunches. Mahmucl followed close, excited by
the horse in front of him, and rose to his work
gallantly ; but this time it was timber and not quickset
that had to be cleared, and that stiff rail was just
too much for the old hunter's legs. He blundered,
hit himself with the sharp edge of the rail, and
fell heavily forward, sending his rider flying into the
next field, and sinking in a struggling mass into the
ditch. Major Swan wick dismounted in an instant,
scrambled over the hedge, and ran to help Harrington
up.

Are you hurt ? "

Mot much," answered the fallen roan, staggering
to his feet, hatless, and with a dazed look.
I'm afraid my horse is done for, though, poor old
chap."

In that moment his only thought was of the beast
he had been fond of, which had been to him as a
friend, albeit often an unmanageable one. He had
no thought just then of the money Value of that
doubled-up mass lying in the ditch.

Mahmud had finished his course. His forearm
was broken, and the most merciful thing was to
make a swift end of him with a bullet from a gun
which one of the whips fetched from the nearest
farmhouse. His owner stood by him and waited for
the end, while Juliet and the rest of the hunt
galloped away out of sight. When the shot had
been fired the black horse was left to be carted off
to the kennels, and Harrington turned to walk
slowly and sorrowfully to the farmhouse, where he
was promised a trap to convey him to the " Medio w
Arms. "

Then and then only did he discover that he had
dislocated his shoulder, and was suffering acute

agony, and then and then only did he remember the
acceptance which he had given for the black horse.

Where now were the fifty pounds which he had
reckoned upon getting for the animal at Tattersall's,
trusting to Providence, or old Hayfield, to make up
the balance of thirty. He saw himself now with that
horrible acceptance falling due and no assets.

He got back to the rustic inn, with great suffering,
and laid himself down upon the stony-hearted four-poster
instead of dressing to go and dine at Medlow.
The village surgeon came and attended to his
shoulder, a painful business, though not unskilfully
done ; and then he was told he must keep himself
as quiet as possible for a few days, and must not
think of travelling till the inflammation was reduced.
It was his right shoulder on which he had fallen, and
he was utterly helpless. The handy young man of
the " Medlow Arms " had to valet him and assist him
to eat the tough mutton chop which was served to
him in lieu of all the delicacies of Medlow Court.

A messenger came from that hospitable mansion
at ten o'clock with a little note from Juliet.

Why did you not turn up at dinner time ?
Major Swanwick said you were all right. I waited

till I saw you get up, safe and sound. So sorry for
poor old Mahmud. Come to breakfast tomorrow
and tell us all about it. We killed in a quarter of
an your.  Yours, Juliet."

Harrington sent bis best regards to Miss Baldwin
and bis apologies to Lady Burdensome, and begged
to inform them that be bad dislocated bis shoulder,
and was unable to write.

He had a miserable night  sleepless and in pain
haunted by the ghost of Mahmud, whose miserable
end afflicted him sorely, and troubled by the
perplexities of his financial position. Should he tell
his father the whole truth ? Alas, it seemed only
yesterday that he bad told his father the whole truth
about his college debts ; and though truthfulness is
a great virtue, a second burst of candour coming on
the heels of the first might be too much for Mr.
Dalbrook's patience.

Should he borrow the money from Juanita ? No,
too humiliating. He had always felt a restraining
pride in all his intercourse with his grand relations
at Cheriton Chase. They were of his own blood ;
but they were above him in social status, and he was
sensitively alive to the difference in position.

Could he apply to his brother ? Again the answer
was in the negative. He doubted whether Theodore
possessed eighty guineas in the world.

And so he went on revolving the same considerations
through his fevered brain all through the long
winter night. There were moments of exasperation
and semi-delirium, when he thought he would go
over to Medlow Court as soon as he was able to move,
and appeal to the beneficence of Lady Burdenshaw
for the temporary accommodation of a cheque for
eighty guineas.

And thus the night wore on till the morning
sounds of the inn brought the sense of stern reality
across his feverish dreams ; and then, amidst the
crowing of cocks, and the bumping of pails, and
tramping of horses in the stable yard, he contrived
to fall asleep, after having failed in that endeavour
all through the quiet of the night.

It was about half-past eleven, and the handy-man
had helped him to make a decent toilet and to establish
himself upon a sofa that was a little harder
than the bed, when a pony-carriage drove up to the
door, and the chamber-maid came in with an awestricken
face to announce Lady Burdenshaw and

another lady, and would he please to see them, as
they wanted to come upstairs.

The room was tidy, and he was dressed as well asa
helpless man could be, so he said yes, they might
come up, which was almost unnecessary, as they
were already on the stairs, and were in the room a
minute afterwards.

Juliet expressed herself deeply concerned at her
lover's misfortune, though she did not attempt to
conceal from him that she considered his riding in
fault. Lady Burdenshaw was more sympathetic,
and was horrified at the discomfort of his surroundings.


You cannot possibly endure that cruel-looking
sofa till your shoulder is well," she said, " and such
a small room, too, poor fellow ; and a horrid low
ceiling ; and the house smells damp. I wonder if
we could venture to move him to the Court, Ju ? "

Ju was of opinion that such a proceeding would
be to the last degree dangerous.

The only chance for his shoulder is to keep
quiet," she said.

Unfortunately, the surgeon had said the same
thing, and there could be no doubt about it.

"Perhaps you could send him a sofa ? " suggested
Juliet.

Of course I could ; and I can send him soups
and jellies and things  but that isn't like having
him at Medio w, where he could have a large airy-room,
and where you and I could take it in turns
to amuse him."

Dear Lady Burdenshaw, you are too good to an
almost stranger," murmured Harrington, moved to
the verge of tears by her geniality.

"Stranger! fiddlestick. Don't I know your
cousin, Lord Cheriton ; and has not your father
done business for me ? Besides, I like young men,
when they're modest and pleasant, as you are.
Indeed I sometimes like them when they're impertinent.
I like young faces and young voices
about me. I like to be amused, and to see people
happy. I can't endure the idea of your lying forever
so many days and nights in this dog-kennel,
when you came to Medlow to enjoy yourself."

"It mustn't be many days and nights. I must
get home somehow by the end of the week, if I post
all the way."

Oh, you needn't post. When you are able to

be moved, my carriage shall take you to the station ;
and I'll get the railroad people to take an invalid
carriage through to Dorchester for you."

"Indeed, you must not be impatient, Harry,"
said Juliet. "I shall come to see you every day,
except on the hunting days, and even then I can
walk over in the evening if Lady B. will let me."

Of course I shall let ycu. All my sympathies
are with lovers, and when you are married I shall
give Mr. Dalbrook as much of my business as I
possibly can venture to take away from those dear
old fossils at Salisbury, who have been the family
lawyers for the best part of a century."

Juliet had confided her engagement to Lady B.
at the beginning of her visit, and she and Lady B.
had talked over the young man's chances of doing
well in the world, and the wisdom or the foolishness
of such an alliance. Lady B. had seen a good deal
of smart young men and women, and she had discovered
that the smart young men were very keen in
the furtherance of their own interests, and that the
smart young women had considerable difficulty in
getting themselves permanently established in the
smart world by smart marriages. Some were beautiful.

II. Q

ful, and many were admired ; but they bad to wait
for eligible suitors, and one false step in the early
stages of their career would sometimes blight their
chances of success. Juliet had taken many false
steps, and had got herself a good deal talked about,
and Lady Burdenshaw felt that her chance of making
an advantageous match had been lessening year by
year until it had come to be almost nil.

If this young fellow is sensible and good-looking,
and has a little money, I really think, Ju, you ought
to marry him," concluded Lady B., talking the
matter over with her protegee before she had seen
Harrington.

She fancied that Juliet had cooled somewhat in
her feelings towards her youthful lover within the
last week or ten days. It might be, Lady B.
thought, that she began to perceive that he was too
young, that the difference in their ages, which was
not much, and the difference in their worldly experience,
which was enormous, unfitted them to be
happy together.

No doubt the young man is a pis aller" reflected
Lady Burdenshaw, after Harrington's appearance
at Medlow, " but he is a very good-looking

fellow, and by no means bad  as a pis aller. Of
course, he is too young for Juliet, and much too
fresh and innocent to understand her ; but if he
knew more he wouldn't be so eager to marry her 
so she ought to be satisfied."

Lady Burdenshaw sent a delightful sofa, and a
lot of books, flowers, pillows, foot-rests, and other
luxuries in one of her own waggons, within an hour
of her return to Medlow, and Harrington's comfort
was considerably increased by her kindness. Still
the thought of that wretched acceptance was like a
thorn in every cushion, a scorpion under every
pillow, a wasp in every flower. Nor was he altogether
at ease about Juliet. He thought that he
had detected a constraint in her manner, a shiftiness
in her eyes. It had wounded him that she had so
promptly opposed his being conveyed to Medlow.
It might be that she was influenced only by concern
for his safety ; yet it would have been natural for
his betrothed to wish to have him under the same
roof with her, where she might tend and comfort
him in his helplessness. Pain and anguish were
wringing his brow, and she who should have been

Q 2

his ministering angel was content to limit her
ministration to half-an-hour of somewhat disjointed
conversation, and to the polite attention of bringing
him the morning papers, when everybody at Medlow
had looked at them.

Lady Burdenshaw had very kindly taken upon
herself to write to Matthew Dalbrook, explaining his
son's prolonged absence, and making light of his
accident as a matter only involving a few days'
rest.

The few days had gone on till the fourth day
after his fall, and in spite of all that Lady Burden-shaw
had done to ameliorate his captivity the hours
of the day and the night seemed to grow longer and
longer, till he began to think of Silvio Pellicle and
the man in the iron mask. Juliet's visits were very
short, and she was obviously absent-minded and
bored even during that scanty half-hour which she
gave to her betrothed.

I'm afraid you are like Colonel Enderby's wife,"
he said, " and that the sight of sickness or suffering
is more than you can bear."

Who was Colonel Enderby's wife? "

Don't you know ? She is the heroine of a very

clever novel  an original, strange  and I fear not
unnatural character."

Don't remember her," answered Juliet, carelessly.
" I don't read many English novels. They
are too slow for me."

On the hunting day he missed even that brief
visit, and was expectant of her coming all the evening,
as she had promised to make up for the day's
absence. But the night was wet, and she told him
next day that she did not like to take out Lady
Burdenshaw's horse and man in such weather.

The stable people would have resented it, and
I am obliged to stand well with the stable," she
said.

He thought she had a troubled look that day. It
seemed to him that it cost her an effort to keep her
attention upon any subject, and she lapsed into
silence every now and then, looking dreamily out of
the window to the thatched roofs and ploughed fields
in the distance.

I'm afraid you have something on your mind,"
he said.

What nonsense ! "What put such an idea into
your head ? "

You are so thoughtful, and so much more silent
than usual."

There is so little to talk about in a sick room.
If I were to tell you about our doings at Medlow I
should only bore you."

Not at all. I should be very pleased to hear
how you amuse yourself. Is Major Swan wick still
there?"

"Yes; he is still there."

He saw that her cheeks crimsoned as she answered
his question, and he wondered whether she
really had any penchant for the Major, or whether
she suspected his jealous apprehensions upon that
subject. She got up to go before he could question
her further.

"I shall be late for luncheon," she said, "and
Lady B. hates any of us to be absent ! "

I thought there was no such thing as punctuality
at Medlow."

Oh, we are pretty punctual at luncheon. It's
the hungry hour, and we are all ravenous. Goodbye."


Au revoir. You will come tomorrow, love;
and come earlier, I hope."

Pas possible. I shall be out with the hounds."

Another blank day for me. But don't disappoint
me in the evening, whatever the weather maybe."


She was gone, leaving him doubtful of her
fidelity, though far from suspecting the extent of her
falsehood.

He endured the long, dull day as best he might,
and improved his mind by skimming all the books
which Lady Burdenshaw had sent him, which were
really the cream of Muche's last supply  travels,
memoirs, gossip, magazines  books chosen with a
view to the masculine mind, which was supposed to
be indifferent to fiction. Evening came at last.
His lamp was lighted, his fire swept and garnished.
The hunting party would be jogging homeward in
the wintry darkness, he thought. There were three
hours to wait before half-past nine, which was
the earliest time at which he could expect his
beloved.

It was a little after the half hour, when his heart
began to beat faster at the sound of carriage wheels.
This time she was not going to disappoint him. He
listened for her step upon the stair  the firm, quick

tread he knew so well; but it was another step
which he heard, a slower and heavier tread, with
much rustling of silken draperies. It must be
Lady Burdenshaw come to chaperon her.

It was Lady Burdenshaw, but alone. She came
in and drew near his sofa with a serious countenance.


Great God ! " he cried, starting up from his
reclining position ; "is anything the matter ? An
accident in the hunting field ! Is she hurt ? "

No, my poor fellow. She's not hurt. It would
take a great deal to hurt her. She's too hard. But
she has done her best to hurt you."

What do you mean ? "

She has gone off with that audacious scamp."

Major Swanwick ? "

Yes. Did you suspect anything ? ''

I thought there was an understanding between
them."

They went off together early this morning ;
walked five miles to the station, leaving their luggage
to be looked after by the Major's servant, who
had received his instructions and who got everything
packed and off by the one o'clock train for London.

I got this telegram late in the afternoon from Salisbury."


She handed him a telegram, which he read
slowly, word by word, and then he slowly folded
it and restored it to his visitor, in heart-stricken
silence.

The telegram was in these words : 

To Lady Burdexshaw, Medlow Court, 
Major Swanwick and I were married at two o'clock,
before the Registrar. We start for Monte Carlo
to-night. Please break it to Harrington, and forgive
me for going away without telling you. "We
thought it better to avoid fuss.  Yours lovingly,

"Juliet Swanwick."

God help this infatuated girl," said Lady
Burdenshaw. " She has married a scoundrel who
is up to his eyebrows in debt. He behaved
brutally to his first wife, and he is not very likely
to treat this one any better. I'm very sorry I ever
had them in my house together. He was an old
flame, and he had lost her more than one good
match by his equivocal attentions. As for you,

my dear young fellow, I congratulate you upon a
very lucky escape."

Harrington put his hand before his eyes to hide
the tears of mortification and wounded love. Yet,
even while the sense of disappointment was keenest,
he had a feeling that Lady Burdenshaw was right,
and that he had escaped a lifelong martyrdom.
How could he, with his limited means, have ever
satisfied a woman who lived only for pleasure and
excitement, dress and dissipation ? Juliet had been
very frank with him during their brief courtship,
and he had seen enough of her character to know
that this splendid creature was not of the stuff that
makes a good wife for a professional man with his
struggles all before him. He was sorry, he was
angry, he was wounded to the quick ; but in the
midst of it all he felt that there was a burden lifted
off his mind and off his life  that he could breathe
more freely, that he was no longer over weighted in
the race.

Lady Burdenshaw stopped with him for an hour,
and told him a good many small facts to his
charmer's discredit, although he begged her more
than once to desist. It was her only idea of comforting

him, and it may be that her efforts were not
misdirected.

He was surprised on the following afternoon by a
visit from his father, who was not satisfied with
Lady Burdenshaw's report of his condition.
Touched by this evidence of paternal affection the
young man took heart of grace and made a full
confession  first of his engagement, and next of his
pecuniary obligations  the acceptance so soon to fall
due, the twenty pounds borrowed from Hayfield.

I can pay that very easily out of my allowance,"
he said, " I only tell you about it to show what a
mean hound I was becoming."

You were very hard driven, my poor boy. You
had been unlucky enough to fall in love with an unprincipled
woman. You may thank Providence for
having escaped a life of misery. Such an alliance as
that would have wrecked your future. I would
rather you married a housemaid with a good
character than such a woman as Juliet Baldwin.
However, there are plenty of nice girls in your own
sphere, thank God, and plenty of pretty girls with
unblemished character and antecedents."

Harrington went back to Dorchester with his

father next day, and the acceptance was promptly
honoured when it was presented at the house in
Cornhill.

Sir Henry had discounted it at the local bank
almost immediately after it passed into his possession,
and the bank had regarded the document as
good value for their money, Matthew Dalbrook being
very unlikely to allow his son's signature to be dishonoured.


"All the spring-time of his love
Is already gone and past."

Theodore went back to wintry London before
the year was a week old. He settled himself by his
lonely fireside, in the silence of his old-fashioned
rooms. All he had of the beauty of this world was
a glimpse of the river athwart the heavy grey mists
of a London morning, or the lamps on the embankment
shining like a string of jewels in the evening
dusk. There were days of sullen, hopeless fog,
when even these things were hidden from him,
and when it was hard work to keep that stealthy,
penetrating greyness and damp cold out of his
rooms.

He had brought a fox-terrier from Dorchester on
his return from his holiday, an old favourite that
had seen the best days of her youth, and was better
able to put up with a sedentary life, varied only by

an occasional run, than a younger animal would
have been. This faithful friend, an animated little
beast even at this mature stage of her existence,
lightened the burden of his loneliness, were it only
by leaping on to his knees twenty times in five
minutes, and only desisting therefrom upon most
serious remonstrance. It was pleasant to him to
have something that loved him, even this irrepressible
Miss Nipper, with her sidelong grin of affectionate
greeting, and her unconquerable suspicion
of rats behind the wainscot. He felt less like Dr.
Faustus on that famous Easter morning, when the
emptiness of life and learning came home to the
lonely student with such desolating intensity, when
even a devil was welcome who could offer escape
from that dull burden of existence.

He had come back from his brief holiday dejected
and disheartened. It seemed to him that she who
was his lode star was more remote from him than
she had ever been  more and more remote  vanishing
into a distant world where it was vain for him
to follow. He had failed in the task that she had
imposed upon him. He was no nearer the solution
of that dark mystery which troubled her life than he

had been when he first promised to help her. How
poor and impotent a creature he must appear in her
eyes. His only discoveries had been negative. All
that his keen, trained intellect, sharpened by seven
years of legal experience, had been able to do was to
prove the unsoundness of her own theory. He had
started no theory upon his part. No flash of genius
had illumined the obscurity which surrounded Godfrey
Carmichael's death.

He went on with his plodding work, resolutely
bent upon doing the utmost that patient labour can
do to ensure success. Even if it were all vain and
futile  that hope of winning favour in her eyes 
the mere possibility of standing better with her, of
showing her that he was of the stuff which goes to
the making of distinguished men  even this was
worth working for.

She may have great offers by-and-by," he told
himself, recalling what Lord Cheriton had said about
his daughter's chances. " With her beauty and her
expectations, to say nothing of her present means,
she is sure of distinguished admirers ; but at the
worst she cannot look down upon a man who is on
the road to success in her father's profession."

This ever-present consideration, joined to his love
of his calling, sweetened all that was dry and dull
in the initial stages of a barrister's career. While
other men of his age were spending their evenings
at the Gaiety Theatre, seeing the same burlesque
and laughing at the same jokes night after night,
as appetite grew with what it fed on, Theodore was
content to sit in chambers and read law. It was
not that he was wanting in appreciation of the
drama. There was no man in London better able
to enjoy the dignity of Hamlet at the Lyceum, or
the rollicking fun of the Gaiety Bluebeard. He was
no pedantic piece of clay, proud of the dulness that
calls itself virtue. He was only an earnest worker,
bent upon a given result, and able to put aside
every hindrance upon the road that he was travelling.


They that run in a race run all, but one
obtained the prize," he said to himself, recalling a
sentence in an epistle that he had learned years ago
at his mother's knee, words that always brought
back the cold brightness of early spring, and a
period of extra church services, long sermons in the
lamp-lit church, and the voices of strange preachers,

a time of daffodils and fish dinners, and much talk
of High and Low Church. He had never faltered
in his religious convictions ; yet in the days of his
youth that Lenten season in a country town, that
recurrent sound of church hells in the chilly March
twilight, had weighed heavy upon his soul.

Almost the only recreation which he allowed himself
in this winter season was an occasional attendance
at Miss Newton's tea-parties. He had secured
acceptance for himself at these entertainments on
the strength of his reading, and he was now established
as a Shakspeare reader ; Miss Xewton
having taken it into her head that Shakspeare is
of all great poets the easiest understood by the
people, and having ordered him to read Shakspeare
until she should tell him to desist.

"I know what they like and what they dislike,"
she said. " They'll not conceal their feelings from
me when we talk you over after you've gone. As
soon as ever I find them getting tired I'll let you
know."

He began with Macbeth, a story which caught
them at the very first page. The witches took their
breath away ; and when he came to the murder

VOL. II. b

scene they were all sitting round him with their hair
seemingly on end. He closed his first reading with
that awful knocking at the gate ; that one supreme
stage effect which has never yet been paralleled by
mortal dramatist. There were some of the girls
who tumbled off their chairs and grovelled on the
floor in their excitement. There were others who
wanted to know the fate of Macbeth and his wife on
the instant.

"I do hope they were both hung, like the manning,"
said a meek widow.

Oh, but he wasn't so much to blame, Mrs.
Kirby. That wicked woman drove him to it."

So did Mrs. Manning," argued a Bermondsey
lady, "but they hung Manning all the same when
they caught him. I was a child when it happened,
but I remember hearing about them. He was
took in Jersey, and she wore a black satin gown."

Oh, don't talk about your Manning, Mrs.
Hodge," cried one of the girls indignantly. " They
were low, vulgar people. These were a King and
Queen in a palace. It's all different. It lifts one
up out of one's own life only to hear about them.
You may read about murders in the newspapers till

your eyes begin to swim, but you won't feel like
that. I don't know when I've felt so sorry for anybody
as I feel for King Macbeth."

Marian sat silent, and refrained from all part in
the chorus of criticism, but she moved to the piano
presently and began to play a Scotch air  a grand
old march  slow, solemn music that was almost too
much for the nerves of the more excitable among
Miss Newton's party. She glided from one melody
to another, and she played those wild Scottish airs
with such thrilling power that they seemed to
sustain and intensify the uncanny effect of the
tragic reading.

Theodore went over to the piano and stood beside
her as she played.

I knew you were a musician," he said, " though
I never heard you touch the keys till to-night."

"How did you know?"

My cousin Juanita told me. She remembered
your playing in her mother's room when she was a
child."

The woman called Marian lifted her eyes to him
with a look of patient reproach, as if she said,
You are cruel to hit army one so helpless as I

B 2

am," and then, playing all the time, she answered
coldly, 

I do not know what you are talking about."
Don't you ! Oh, but indeed I think you do,
and I should be very glad to be of use to you if you
would let me, for the sake of those old clays. I
don't think it is possible I can be mistaken, though
you may have your oven reason for refusing to confide
in me."

He was certain now in his own mind that this was
Mercy Porter and no other. That fine touch upon the
piano implied sustained and careful cultivation. She
did not play like a girl who had learnt music as an
afterthought.

He left the house when she did, and walked part
of the way to Hercules Buildings with her, but did
not offer to go out of his way to see her home, being
very sure she would refuse.

I wish you would trust me," he said gently, as
they walked side by side, without looking at each
other. "Believe me that every one at Cheriton is
sorry for you. If you were to go back to the neighbourhood
you would have everybody's sympathy.
There would be no one to cast a stone."

I am very sorry I ever mentioned Cberiton to
you, Mr. Dalbrook," sbe said impatiently. " It was
a foolish impulse that made me talk. You insist
upon making guesses. You try to force a confession
from me. It is hardly generous."

My interest in you must be my excuse."

You can do me no good by that kind of interest.
I shall never see Dorsetshire again  so what can it
matter who I was when I lived in that part of the
world. There are hundreds of women in London as
lonely as I am  hundreds  perhaps thousands 
wbo have broken every link with their past. My
life suits me well enough, and I am contented. I
shall never try to change it."

That is a pity. You are young enough to make
a good wife to an honest man, to help in creating a
happy home."

Am I ? I feel a century old ; and I have done
with every thought of love or marriage. "When I
woke to consciousness after that dreadful fever,
awoke from darkness and oblivion like that of the
grave, I entered upon a new life. I came out of
that sickness like one who bad passed through hell.
Passion and hope and youth, and good looks, had

been burnt out of me in a fiery furnace. It was a
wonder to myself that my body was alive. It was
no wonder to me that my heart was dead. From
that time I have lived very much as I am living
now  after a brief time of struggle and starvation 
and the life suits me fairly well. I shall never seek
to better it."

That is hard, Marian."

He called her by her Christian name, frankly, in
almost paternal friendliness, not knowing any other
name by which to call her.

He was with Miss Newton earlier than usual on
the occasion of her next tea-drinking, so early as to
be before anybody else, and he talked to his hostess
about Marian  Marian Gray, Miss Newton called
her  confiding to her his conviction that this young
woman was no other than Mrs. Porter's missing
daughter. He told her of his interview with Mrs.
Porter, and of the mother's angry repudiation of her
child.

I can but think that her hardness was assumed,"
he said, " and that the ice would melt at a touch if
the mother and daughter could be brought together.
I should like to try the experiment."

It is hardly wise to try experiments with human
hearts," said Miss Xewton. " Marian is contented
and at peace, if not happy. To force her back upon
a mother who might be hard and bitter to her  do
you think that would be true kindness? "

"What if the mother's heart has been yearning
for her lost lamb in all these years, and by bringing
her back I might make two lives happy."

Let the mother come to the child. Let her
who has something to forgive be the one to make
the advance. It is so hard for the sinner to go
back. She must be helped back. If the mother
were a woman with a motherly heart she would
have been searching for her lost child in all those
years instead of wrapping herself up in her sorrow
at home."

"I own I have thought that."

Of course you have. You can't think otherwise
as a sensible man. I have no patience with
such a mother. As for Marian, I think she may
get on very well as she is. I am fond of her, and
I believe she is fond of me. She earns from twelve
to fourteen shillings a week. She pays five shillings
for her room, and she lives upon eighteen a day.

I needn't tell you that the teapot is her piece de
resistance. Her most substantial meal on some
clays consists of a couple of scones from the Scotch
baker's, or a penny loaf and a hard boiled egg ; but
when I go to see her she gives me an admirable cup
of tea, and positively delicious bread and butter.
Her room is the very pink and pattern of neatness.
All the instincts of a lady show themselves in that
poor little two-pair back. She has curtained the
iron bedstead and the window with white dimity,
which is always clean and fresh, for she washes andirons
it with her own hands. She generally contrives
to have a bunch of flowers upon her work-table, and
hard as she works, her room is always free from
litter. She has about half-a-dozen books of her own
upon the mantelshelf, her Bible, Milton, Shakspeare,
Charles Lamb's Essays, Goldsmith's Poems,
and the "Idols of the King"  well-worn volumes,
which have been her companions for years. She
borrows other books from the Free Library, and her
mind is always being cultivated. I really believe
she is happy. She is one of those rare individuals
who can afford to live alone. Do not disturb her
lightly."

You are right perhaps. The mother struck meas
by no means a pleasant character, always supposing
that Mrs. Porter is her mother, of 'which I
myself have very little doubt."

Theodore made no further effort to bring mother
and daughter together, but he met Marian from time
to time at Miss Newton's tea parties, and acquaintance
ripened into friendship. Her refinement and
her musical talent sustained his interest in her. He
talked to her of books sometimes when they
happened to be sitting side by side at the tea-table,
and he was surprised at the extent of her reading.
She confessed when he questioned her that she was
in the habit of stealing two or three hours from the
night for her books.

"I find that I can do with a few hours' sleep,"
she said, " if I lie down happy in my mind after
being absorbed in a delightful book. My books are
my life. They give me the whole universe for my
world, though I have to live in one room, and to
follow a very monotonous calling."

He admired the refinement of that purely intellectual
nature, but he admired still more that admirable
tact which regulated her intercourse with Miss Newton's

homelier friends. Never by word or tone or
half-involuntary glance did Marian betray any consciousness
of superiority to the uncultivated herd.
She shared their interests, she sympathized with their
vexations, she neither smiled nor shuddered at
Cockney twang or missing aspirate.

Winter brightened into spring, with all its varieties
of good and evil ; east winds rushing round street
corners, and cutting into the pedestrian like a knife ;
west winds enfolding him like a balmy caress, and
bringing the perfume of violets, the vivid yellow of
daffodils into the wilderness of brick and stone ;
rainy days, grey, monotonous, dismal, hanging on
the soul like a curtain of gloom and hopelessness.
These made up the sum of Theodore's outer life.
Within he had his books, his ambition, and his
faithful love. He told himself that it was a hopeless
love ; but there are many things which a man
tells himself, and tries to believe, and yet does not
believe. The very human longing for blessedness is
too strong for human wisdom. Where there is love,
there is always hope.

He had grown accustomed to his life in chambers ;
and albeit he was much attached to his father, and

was amiably tolerant of his brother arid sisters, he
could but feel that this solitary existence better
suited his temper than residence in a family circle.
At Dorchester it had been very difficult for him to
be alone. Out of business hours his sisters considered
that they had a claim upon him, a right to
waste his life in the most trivial amusements and
engagements. If he withdrew himself from their
society, and that of their numerous dearest friends,
they accused hoi of grumpiness, and thought themselves
ill-treated. He had chafed against the waste
of life, the utter futility of those engagements which
prevented his keeping level with the intellectual
growth of the age. He felt that his youth was
slipping from under him, leaving him stationary,
when every pulse of his being beat impatiently for
progress. And now it was pleasant to him to be
his own master, free to make the best possible use
of his days. He found a few friends in London
whose society suited him, and only a few. Among
these the man of whom he saw most was Cuthbert
Ramsay, a young Scotchman, who had been his
chief companion at Cambridge, who had studied
medicine for three years in Leipsic and Paris with

Ludwig and Pasteur, and who was now at St.
Thomas'. The two young men ran up against each
other in that main artery of London life, the Strand,
in the January twilight, and renewed the friendly
intimacy of that bygone time when Kamsay had
been at Trinity and Dalbrook at Trinity Hall.
They dined together at a restaurant on the evening
of that first meeting, and after dinner Theodore took
his friend to his chambers, where the two sat late
into the night talking over college reminiscences of
hall and river.

Cuthbert Ramsay had been one of the most remarkable
undergraduates of those days, notable
alike for mental and physical gifts which lifted him
out of the ruck. He was six feet two  with the
form of an athlete and as handsome a face as was
ever seen within the gates of Trinity  and these
advantages of person, which would have been noteworthy
in any man, were the more remarkable in
him, because of his utter indifference to them, or,
perhaps, it may be said, complete unconsciousness
of them. He knew that he was a big man, because
his tailor told him as much ; but he had never
taken into consideration the question as to whether

lie was or was not a handsome roan ; indeed, except
when he had his hair cut, an operation which he
always submitted to unwillingly and of dire necessity,
it is doubtful if he ever looked into a glass long
enough to know what manner of man he was ; certainly
not at his morning toilet, when he moved
restlessly about the room hairbrushes in hand, belabouring
his handsome head, and exercising his
extraordinary memory by the repetition of some
scientific formula acquired during the previous
night's reading.

His own estimate of his appearance was comprise!
in the idea that he was " very Scotch." That
milky whiteness of complexion, touched with just
enough ruddy colour to give life to the face, those
brilliant blue eyes, the straight nose, clear-cut nostrils,
firm lips and firmer chin, the high broad brow,
and crisp auburn hair, constituted to his mind
nothing more than his brevet of nationality.

"No one would ever take me for anything but a
Scotchman," he would say lightly, if any acquaintance
ventured to hint at his good looks. " There's
no mistake about me. Albion is written on my
brow."

From his childhood upwards he had cared only for
large things  intent upon investigation and discovery
from the time he could crawl  asking the
most searching questions of mother and of nurse 
prying into those abstract mysteries which perplex
philosophers before he could speak plain. The
thirst for knowledge had grown with his growth and
strengthened with his strength. His hardy boyhood
had been spent for the most part in the windy
streets of Aberdeen, marching with swinging stride
along that granite pavement, his shabby red gown
flapping in the north-easter ; faring anyhow, as indifferent
to what he ate as he was to what he wore,
ahead of his fellows in all things intellectual, and
abreast with the best athletes of his year in the
sports they valued, a king among men, and of such
a happy disposition that nothing in life came amiss
to him, and what would have been hardship to
another seemed sport to him.

Some one, a wealthy member of his extensive
family, found out that this Cuthbert w r as no
common youth, and that with a little encouragement
he might do honour to the clan. This distant
kinsman, one of the heads of the great house of

Ramsay, sent him to Cambridge, where he entered
as a scholar of his college, and at the end of a year
gained a University scholarship, which made him
independent. This hardy youth from the city of
Bon Accord was able to live upon so little  could
not for the life of him have been extravagant, having
none of that mollesse, or soft self-indulgence, which
is at the root of most men's squandering. He was
nine-and-twenty years of age, and he had never worn
a gardenia, and had only had one suit of dress
clothes since he grew to man's estate. Needless to
say that albeit he went out very seldom that suit
was now somewhat shabby ; but Cuthbert's superb
appearance neutralized the shabbiness, and he looked
the finest man in any assembly. His parents were
in their graves before he left the University. He
had no ties. He was free as Adam would have been
if Eve had never been created. There was no one
near or dear to him to feel proud of his honours,
though his name was high in the list of strangers,
and he had taken a first class in science. And now,
after that interval of serious scientific work in
Leipsic and Paris, he was plodding at St. Thomas'
with a view to a London degree, and thus the two

hard-working young men  very intimate in the old
days when Cuthbert's rooms in the Bishop's Hostel
were conveniently adjacent to Theodore's ground
floor in Trinity Hall  were thrown together again
upon their life-journey, and were honestly glad to
renew the old friendship.

Ramsay was delighted with his friend's chambers.

I was afraid there was nothing so good as this
left in the Temple," he said, rapturously contemplating
the blackened old wainscot and the low
ceiling with its heavy cross-beam. " I thought
smartness and brand-new stone had superseded all
that was historical and interesting within the precincts
of the Lamb. But these rooms of yours have
the true smack. Why, I really believe now, Dal-brook,
you must have rats behind that wainscot ? "

Perhaps I had, till Miss Nipper came to keep
me company," answered Theodore, patting the
terrier, whose neat little head and intelligent ears
were lifted at the sound of her name.

And Nipper has made them emigrate to the
next house, no doubt ? "

"I'm glad you like my rooms, Cuthbert."

Like them ! I envy you the ownership more

than I can say. If anything can make me sorry
that I am not a lawyer it would be the fact that I
can't live in the Temple. We doctors have no distinctive
abode, nothing associated with the past."

Perhaps that is because medicine is essentially
a progressive science."

"Is it? Sometimes I begin to doubt if it
has made any progress since Galen  or Albertus
Magnus. I will admit that there was progress of
some kind up to his time."

This house has an interest for me that it would
have for no one else," said Theodore, presently,
while his friend filled his briar-wood. "My kinsman,
Lord Cheriton, occupied the rooms underneath
these for about a dozen years ; and it is a
fancy of mine to keep his image before me as I sit
here alone with my books. It reminds me of what
a man can do in the profession which so many of my
friends declare to be hopeless."

Xo one knows anything about it, Theodore. If
you went into statistics you would find that the
chances of success in the learned professions are
pretty nearly equal. So many men will get on, and
so many will fail, at every trade, in every calling,

VOL. II. s

The faculty of success lies in the man himself. I
always thought you were the kind of man to do well
in whatever line you hit upon. A calm, clear brain
and a resolute will are the first factors in the sum of
life. And so Lord Cheriton lived in this house, did
he ? I have heard people talk of him as a very distinguished
man, as well as a very lucky one. By
the bye, it was in his house that strange murder occurred
last year."

Yes, it was in his house, and it was his daughter's
husband who was murdered."

Tell me the story, Theodore," said Ramsay,
leaning back his handsome head, and half closing
his eyes, with the air of a man who liked hearing
about murders. " I read the account in the papers
at the time, but I've very nearly forgotten all
about it."

Theodore complied, and gave his friend the
history of the case, and the failure of every attempt
to find the murderer.

And there has been nothing discovered since
last summer?"

"Nothing!"

That is rather hard upon Lord Cheriton  bearing

in mind your detective's suggestion of a vendetta.
The vendetta would not be likely to close
with the death of Sir Godfrey Carmichael. Hatred
would demand further victims  Lord Cheriton himself
perhaps  or this lovely young widow  but there
could hardly be such a vindictive feeling without a
strong cause. Enmity so deadly must have had a
beginning in a profound sense of wrong."

I have studied the case from that point of view,
but can discover no cause for such malignity. I
have almost given up all hope of unravelling the
mystery."

And your kinsman is to live under the sword of
Damocles for the rest of his life ? Upon my soul I
pity him. I can imagine nothing in Ireland worse
than the murder of Sir Godfrey Carmichael  a man
seated peacefully in his own drawing-room ; and a
high-principled, amiable young man, you tell me, who
never was known to wrong his fellow man."

Theodore Dalbrook did not spend his Easter
holidays in Dorsetshire. He had heard from his
sisters that Juanita was staying at Swanage with
Lady Jane Carmichael. He was unwilling to ins

2

truce upon her there, and he had nothing to communicate
upon the subject which was at present
his only claim upon her interest. Under these circumstances
he was easily persuaded to spend his
vacation in a ten days' trip to Holland with Cuthbert
Kamsay, who was keenly interested in the result of
some experiments which had lately been made at
Leyden; and thus it happened that Theodore let
some time go by without seeing any member of his
family except his father, who came to London occasionally
upon business, and whom his son was delighted
to entertain and make much of in his
chambers or at his club, the serviceable Constitutional.


Towards the end of April he read an announcement
in the papers which had touched him almost to
tears.

On the 23rd inst., at Milbrook Priory, the widow
of Sir Godfrey Carmichael, of a posthumous son."

He was thankful for her sake that this new
interest had been given to her days  that a new and
fair horizon was open to her in this young life, withall
its possibilities of love and gladness. It might
be that the coming of this child would change the

current of her thoughts, that the stern desire for
retribution would grow less keen, that the agonizing
sense of loss would be softened almost to forgetfulness.
He remembered those lovely lines of the
poet philosopher's

A child, more than all other gifts,

Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts*'

This child came, he hoped, freighted with healing
and comfort, came like the glad spring-time
itself, like Adonis cr Persephone, with his arms full
of flowers.

He wrote to his cousin, in tenderest congratulation,
a letter breathing a generous affection, without
one selfish thought lurking between the lines.

Her answer came after nearly a month's delay,
but, although tardy, it was most delightful to him.
Juanita asked him to be Godfather to her boy ; and
he could easily imagine that this was the highest
honour she could offer him.

"In London half the young men I used to meet
took a pride in avowing their unbelief," she wrote,
but I know that you are not ashamed to acknowledge
your faith in Christ and His Church. I shall
feel secure that what you promise for my child will

be fulfilled, so far as it is in your power to bring
about its fulfilment. I know that if you stand beside
the font and take those vows in His name you
will not remember that ceremony as an empty forma
mere concession to usage and respectability.
Those promises will appeal to you for my fatherless
child in the days to come. They will make you his
friend and protector."

He accepted the trust with greater gladness than
he had felt about anything that had happened to
him for a long time; and on a balmy morning in
the last week of May he found himself standing by
the font of the old Saxon church at Milbrook where
he had heard the solemn words of the Burial Service
read above Sir Godfrey Carmichael's coffin less
than a year before. He took upon himself the
custody of the infant's conscience in all good faith,
and he felt that this trust which his cousin had given
to him made a new link between them.

The Grenvilless had come down from town to be
present at the ceremony, though neither husband
nor wife was officially concerned in it. Mrs. Grenville
had seized the opportunity to bring Johnnie and
Godolphin to Dorsetshire for change of air. She

had an idea that the Purbeck air had a particularly
revivifying effect upon them  like unto no other air.

I suppose that is because it is my native air,"
she explained.

Mr. Grenville submitted to his nephew's existence
as a mysterious dispensation of Providence, which it
became him to endure with gentleman-like fortitude,
but he did not cease to regard a posthumous infantas
a solecism in nature and society.

Your sister-in-law actually seems pleased with
her baby," he told his wife, grumblingly, as he put
on a frock coat in honour of the approaching ceremony;
" but it appears to me that a woman of refined
feeling would be impressed with a sense of
incongruity  of indelicacy even  in the idea of a
child born such ages after the father's death  a sort
of no-man's-baby. And upon my word it is uncommonly
hard upon Thomas. With such a family
as ours  five and the possibilities of the future  it
would have been a grand thing to have one well provided
for. As things stand now they must all be
paupers."

Lord Cheriton was Theodore's fellow-sponsor, and

Lady Jane was Godmother, an office which filled the
dear soul with rapture. She held her grandchild
throughout the service, except when she delivered
him gingerly to the priest, who at one stage of the
ceremony, carried the new-made Christian half-way
up the aisle, and, as it were, flaunted him in the face
of the scanty congregation.

Juanita stood like a statue while these rites were
being celebrated, and in her pale set face there was
none of the tender interest which a mother might
be expected to show upon such an occasion. There
was a deep pathos in that marble face and those black
garments in an hour which has generally something
of a festal aspect. Strangers thought her cold, a
proud, hard young woman, thinking more of her
own importance, perhaps, than of her baby ; yet
could they have read beneath the surface they would
have pitied the girl widow in her desolation on this
day which should have been blessed to her. She
could but think of him who was not there ; of the
father who had been fated never to look upon his
son's face ; of the son who was to grow from infancy
to manhood without the knowledge of a
father's love.

Theodore watched that pale and lovely face, full
of sympathy, but riot without wonder. How would
this new tie affect her ? Would it soften all that
was hard and vindictive in her mind  would it be
strong enough to bring about resignation to the will
of Heaven  a patient waiting upon Providence,
instead of that feverish eagerness to exact a life fora
life ?

They two were alone together for only a few
minutes after luncheon, strolling along the broad
gravel walk in front of the dining-room windows, in
the afternoon sunshine, while Lord Cheriton and
Mr. Grenville lingered over coffee and cigars, and
Lady Jane and her daughter made a domestic group
with children and nurses under a gigantic Japanese
umbrella. Short as that tete-astute was it convinced
Theodore that the child had not brought oblivion of
the father's fate.

You have heard nothing more  made no new
discovery, I suppose," Juanita said, nervously.

Nothing. Indeed, Juanita, I fear I have no
talent as an amateur detective. I am not likely to
succeed where Mr. Churton failed. It was easy
enough for me to complete the record of the Strangers

 to set your suspicions at rest with regard to
them. That was plain sailing. But it seems tome
I shall never go any further."

"I'm afraid you will not," she said, wearily;
"and yet I had such hope in your cleverness  your
determination to help me. As a lawyer you would
know how to set about it. The London detective
has many cases  his mind travels from one to
another. He has no leisure to think deeply about
anything  but you who have had so much leisure of
late  you would, I know, be glad to help me."

Glad! Good God, Juanita, you must know that
I would cut off my hand to give you ease or comfort
 respite even from a passing trouble. And if
you are really set upon this thing  if jour peace is
really dependent upon the discovery of your husband's
murderer "

It is, it is, Theodore. I cannot know rest or
comfort while his death remains unpunished. I
cannot lie down in peace at night while I know that
the wretch who killed him is walking about, rejoicing
in his wickedness, glad to have destroyed
that blameless life, laughing at our feeble love which
can let our dead go unavenged."

If cudgelling these poor brains of mine could
bring me any nearer to the truth, Juanita," Theodore
said, with a troubled sigh, " I should have
helped you better ; but so far I can see no ray of
light in the thick darkness. I do not think
any efforts of ours will solve the mystery. Only
some accident, some inconceivable imprudence on the
part of the murderer can put us on his track."

And then he thought with horror of Ramsay's
idea that a hatred so malignant as that which had
killed Godfrey Carmichael might reveal itself in
some new crime. He thought of the young mother
bending over her infant's cradle in some unguarded
room  calm in the fancied safety of her English,
home. He thought of her wandering alone in park
or wood, while that rabid hatred lurked in the
shadow, waiting and watching for the moment of
attack. The horror of the idea chilled him to the
heart, but he was careful not to hint at that horror
to Juanita. He seized the first opportunity of being
alone with Lady Jane, and imparted his fears,
founded upon that suggestion of Cuthbert Ramsay's
to her. The kind creature was quick to take alarm,
and promised to see that Juanita was guarded at all

hours by all precautions that could be taken without
alarming her.

She is surrounded with old and faithful servants,"
said Lady Jane, " a hint to them will put
them on their guard ; but if you thought it wiser I
would take her away from this place  take her away
from England, if necessary. It is horrible to think
of living at the mercy of an unknown foe."

My friend's notion may be groundless. The
crime of last year may have been an isolated act 
the inspiration of madness. In our efforts to account
for the unaccountable we may invent theories
which torture us, and which may yet have no ground
in fact. Only it is as well to think of possibilities,
however hideous."

He spent one night at the Priory, and before departure
next morning, presented his offering of a
fine George the Second mug to his godson, Godfrey
James Dalbrook  who in his present stage of
existence seemed to his Godfather a scarcely distinguishable
morsel of humanity smothered in overmuch
cambric and Valenciennes.

I'm afraid if I were to meet my Godson in the
arms of a strange nurse I should not know him,"

lie said, deprecatingly, after be Lad kissed the rosebud
mouth, "but please God the time will come
when he and I will be firm friends. As soon as he
is old enough to decline mensa I shall feel that we
can converse upon a common footing, and when he
goes to Eton I shall renew my youth every time I
run down to waste an hour in the playing fields
watching him at cricket, or to drive him to the
4 White Hart'"

Although he put on an air of cheerfulness in his
leave-taking, he left the Priory with a sense of
deepest anxiety ; and it was almost a relief to him
when he received a letter from Lady Jane a week
afterwards.

I could not get over the uneasy feeling which
your suggestion awakened," she wrote, " so I am
going to carry off mother and child to Switzerland
the day after tomorrow. luterlaken and Grindelwald
are delightful at this season. "We shall return
to Dorsetshire as soon as the tourists begin to invade
our retreat, and I trust in God that some discovery
may be made in the meantime, so that all our minds
may be more at ease."

Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
That time will come and take my love away.
This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose."

That ghastly idea mooted by Cuthbert Ramsay 
the idea of an unsatisfied hatred still hovering like
a bird of prey over the heads of Juanita and her
child, ready to make its deadly swoop in the hour
that should see her most helpless and unprotected 
gave a new impetus to Theodore's mind, and he
applied himself again to the apparently hopeless
endeavour to find the motive of the murder and the
person of the murderer.

As an initial step he invited Mr. Churton to dine
with him at his chambers, entertained that gentleman
with a well-chosen little dinner sent in from a
famous tavern in the Strand, and a bottle of unexceptionable
port after dinner ; and by this innocent
means got the detective into an expansive frame of

mind, and induced him to discuss the Cheriton
murder in all its bearings.

The result of the long evening's talk differed in
hardly any point from the opinion which Mr. Churton
had formulated at Cheriton. The motive of the
murder must be looked for in some past wrong, or
fancied wrong, inflicted upon the murderer. And
again Mr. Churton returned to his point that there
was a woman at the bottom of it.

Do you mean that a woman fired the shot ? "

Decidedly not. I mean that a woman was the
motive power. Women are not given to avenging
their wrongs with their own hands. They will
instigate the men who love them to desperate crimes
unconsciously perhaps  for they are the first to
howl when the crime has been committed, and the
lover's neck is in danger. But jealousy is the most
powerful factor of all, and I take it jealousy was at
the bottom of the Cheriton crime. I take it that
some intrigue of Sir Godfrey's youth was at the
root of the matter."

Strange as you may consider such a belief, Mr.
Churton, I am inclined to think that Sir Godfrey's
youth was innocent of intrigues  that he never

loved any woman except my cousin, whom he
adored from the time he was eighteen, when she
was a lovely child of eleven. It was a very
romantic attachment, and the kind of attachment
which keeps a man clear of low associations."

You and Lord Cheriton tell me the same story,
sir," said the detective, with a touch of impatience ;
but if this immaculate young man never injured
anybody, how do you account for that bullet ? ' '

"It is unaccountable, except upon a far-fetched
hypothesis."

"What may that be?"

That the act of vengeance  though striking-godfrey
Carmichael  was aimed at Lord Cheriton 
that the blow was meant to ruin his daughter's life,
and by ricochet strike him to the heart. I think we
have spoken of this possibility before to-night."

After that evening with Churton, Theodore made
up his mind that there was no assistance to be
looked for from this quarter. The detective had
exhausted his means of investigation, and had
nothing further to suggest. He was too practical a
man to waste time or thought upon speculative
theories. Theodore saw, therefore, that if he were

to pursue the subject further he must think and
work for himself.

After considering the question from every possible
point of view, he became the more established in
the idea that Godfrey Carmichael had been the
scapegoat of another man's sin, the vicarious victim
whose death was to strike at a guilty life. Of his
youth it was easy to know all that there was to be
known. He had lived in the sight of his fellowmen,
a young man of too much social importance to
be able to hide any youthful indiscretions or wrongdoing.
But what of that other and so much longer
life ? What of the early struggles of the self-made
man ? What of the history of James Dalbrook in
those long years of bachelor life in London, when
he was slowly working his way to the front ? Might
not there have been some hidden sin in that life,
some sin dark enough to awaken a sleepless vengeance,
a malignity which should descend upon him
in the day of peace and prosperity like a thunderbolt
from a clear and quiet sky ?

A man who marries at forty years of age has
generally some kind of history before his marriage ;
and it was in that history Theodore told himself he

VOL. II. T

must look for the secret of Godfrey Carmichael's
death. He was loyal to his kinsman and his
friend ; he was inspired by no prurient curiosity, no
envious inclination to belittle the great man ; he
was prompted solely by his desire to unearth the
hidden foe, and to provide for the safety of Juanita's
future life.

Meditating upon his past intercourse with Lord
Cheriton, and upon every familiar conversation
which he was able to recall, he was surprised to find
how very little his kinsman had ever related of his
London life, before the time when he took silk and
married a rich wife. His allusions to that earlier
period had been of the briefest. He had shown
none of that egotistical pleasure which most successful
men feel in talking of their struggles, and the
rosy dawn of fame, those first triumphs, small perhaps
in themselves, but the after taste of which is
sweeter in the mouth than the larger victories of the
flood-tide. He had never talked of any affairs of
the heart, any of those lighter flirtations and unfinished
romances which elderly men love to recall.
His history, so far as it could be judged by his conversation,
had been a blank.

Either the man must have been a legal machine,
a passionless piece of human clay, caring for nothing
hut professional achievement, in those eighteen years
of manhood between his call to the Bar and his
marriage, or he had lived a life which he could not
afford to talk about. He was either of a duller
clay than his fellow-men, or he had a hidden
history.

Now, as it was hardly possible that James Dal-brook,
judged from either a psychological or a
physiological standpoint, could have been dull and
cold, and plodding, and passionless, at any period of
his career, there remained the inference that he had
a secret history.

Living under the very roof that had sheltered his
cousin in the greater part of his professional career,
Theodore Dalbrook arrived at this conclusion.

What kind of a life had he lived, that young
barrister, briefless and friendless at the outset,
whose name was eventually to become a power, a
weight bringing down the judicial scale on the side of
victory, just as Archer's riding was supposed to
secure the winning of a race. How had he lived in
those early years, when the fight was all before

T 2

him ? What friends had he made for himself, and
what enemies ? What love, or what hate, had agitated
his existence ?

The investigator could only approach the question
in the most common-place manner. It was nearly
a quarter of a century since James Dalbrook had
been a tenant of that ground-floor set, above which
Theodore was pacing up and down in the summer
dusk. He had to find some one who remembered
him at that time.

It would not be his present laundress, a buxom
matron of about five-and-thirty, who had never been
known to any present inhabitant of Ferret Court
without the encumbrance of a baby in arms, or a
baby at the breast. As fast as one baby was disposed
of, there was another coming forward to take
its place. She always brought her baby with her,
and left it about in obscure corners, like an
umbrella. It was always of the order of infant
designated good ; that is to say it was not a squalling
baby. There were some of Mrs. Armstrong's
clients who suspected her of keeping it in a semi-narcotic
condition in the interests of her profession
; but when this practice was hinted at the

matron referred to the necessities of teething, and
hoped she did not require to be reminded of her
duty as a mother.

This good person brought in the lighted lamp
while Theodore was pacing up and down the narrow
limits of his sitting-room. She placed the lamp on
the table, looked inquiringly at her employer, and
then retired, only to return with the tea-tray, which
she arranged lingeringly. She was a talkative person,
with an active intellect, and it irked her to
leave the room without any scrap of conversation,
were it only an inquiry about the postman, or a
casual remark upon the weather.

Nothing being forthcoming from Mr. Dalbrook,
she withdrew to the door, but paused upon the
threshold and dropped a curtsey.

I'm afraid we're going to have a storm to-night,
sir," she said.

The fear was a thing of the moment, inspired by
her desire to talk.

Do you think so, Mrs. Armstrong ? "

I do, indeed, sir. It couldn't be that 'easy if
there wasn't thunder in the air."

"Perhaps not," replied Theodore, indifferently.

Ah ! by the way, how long have you looked after
these chambers ? "

From three years before I was married, sir."

"Is that long?"

"Lor', yes, sir. I should think it was. Why
my Joseph was thirteen on his last birthday."

Let me see ; that would mean about seventeen
years, wouldn't it?"

"Yes, sir."

And I suppose you knew nothing about the
chambers before that time."

I won't say that, sir. I've known them more
or less ever since I could run alone. Mother looked
after them before me. It was only when the rheumatics
took such firm hold of her "  this was said
as if Theodore were thoroughly posted in the case 
that mother gave up. She had done for the gentlemen
in this house for over twenty years ; though
when she married father she never thought to have
to do such work as this, he being a master carpenter
and cabinet maker with a nice business  and she'd
been brought up different, and had more education
than any of us ever had."

Then your mother must have known this house

when Mr. James Dalbrook had the ground floor  the
Mr. Dalbrook who is now Lord Cheriton," said
Theodore, cutting short this biographical matter.

I should think she did, sir. Many's the time
I've heard her talk of him. He was just like you,
sir, in his ways, as far as I can gather  very quiet
and very studious. She waited upon him for nearly
twelve years, so she ought to be a judge of his character.
"

"I should like to have a chat with your mother
some of these days, Mrs. Armstrong."

"Would you, sir? I'm sure she'd be delighted.
She loves talking over old times. She's none of your
Radicals, that are all for changing things, like my
husband. She looks up to her superiors, and she feels
quite proud of having done for Lord Cheriton when
he was just like any other young gentleman in Ferret
Court. Any time you'd like to step round to out-place,
sir, mother would be happy to see you. She'd
be glad to wait upon you, but she's crippled with the
rheumatics, and it's as much as she can do to get
upstairs of a night and downstairs of a morning."

'i'll call upon her tomorrow afternoon, if that
will be convenient."

No fear of that, sir. Shall I look round at four
o'clock and show you where she lives, sir ? It's not
above five minutes' walk."

If you please. I shall be very much obliged."

Gambols's Lane was one of the obscurest alleys
between the Temple and St Bride's Church, but it
was as well known in the locality as if it had been
Regent Street. Thither Mrs. Armstrong conducted
her employer on a sultry June afternoon, and admitted
him with her own private key into one of the
narrowest houses he had ever seen  a house of three
stories, faith one window in each story, and with a
tiny street door squeezed in between the parlour
window and the next house  a house which, if it
had stood alone, would have been a tower. Upon
the narrow street door appeared a wide brass plate
inscribed with the name of "J. W. Armstrong,
plumber," and in the parlour window were exhibited
various indications of the plumbing trade. On a
smaller brass plate just below the knocker appeared
the modest legend, " Miss Motley, ladies' own
materials made up."

The little parlour behind the plumber's emblems

was very close and stuffy upon this midsummer
afternoon, for Mrs. Dugget's complaint necessitated
a fire in season and out of season ; but it was also
spotlessly clean, and preparations had evidently been
made for an afternoon tea of an especially delicate
character. There was a rack of such thu, dry toast
as Mrs. Armstrong's employer affected, and there was
a choice pat of Aylesbury butter, set forth upon the
whitest of table cloths, and flanked by a glass jar of
jam, the glass receptacle being of that ornate character
which dazzles the purchaser into comparative
indifference as to the quality of the jam ; just as
admiring man, caught by outward beauty, is apt to
shut his eyes to the lack of more lasting charms in
the way of temper and character.

Mother thought perhaps you'd honour her by
taking a cup of tea this warm afternoon, sir," said
Mrs. Armstrong, when Theodore had seated himself
opposite the invalid, " and then you can have your
little talk over old times while I look after Armstrong's
supper. He'll eat any bit I choose to give
him for his dinner, and there's days he don't get no
dinner at all, but he always looks for something tasty
for supper, don't he, mother ? "

Mrs. Dugget acknowledged this trait in her son-in-law's
character, and Theodore having graciously accepted
her hospitality, Mrs. Armstrong poured out
the tea, and waited upon the distinguished guest,
and having done this, withdrew to her domestic
duties. She was visible in front of the window five
minutes afterwards, setting out with a basket over
her arm, evidently in quest of the " something
tasty " that was needful to her husband's wellbeing.


Your daughter tells me that you remember my
cousin, Lord Cheriton, when he was Mr. Dalbrook,"
said Theodore, when he and the old woman were
alone together, except for the presence of a very
familiar black cat, which pushed its chilly nose into
Theodore's hand, and rubbed its sleek fur against
Theodore's legs, with an air of slavish adulation.

It isn't everybody that Tom takes to," said Mrs.
Suggest, touched by her favourite's conduct. " He's
a rare judge of character, is Tom. I've had him
from a kitten, and his mother before him. Yes, sir,
I ought to remember his lordship, seeing that I
waited upon him for over eleven years ; and a quiet
gentleman he was to attend upon, giving next to no

trouble, and never using bad language, or corning
home the worse for drink, as I've known a gentleman
behave in that very set."

Did he live in his chambers all that time ? "
Well, sir, nominally he did, but actually he
didn't. He had his bedroom and his bath-room,
just as you have; and the rooms was furnished pretty
comfortable, and everything about them was very neat,
for he was uncommonly particular, was Mr. Dalbrook ;
and he was always there of a day, and all day long,
except when he was at the law courts, for there never
was a more persevering gentleman. But after the
first three years I can't say that he lived in Ferret
Court. He came there by nine or ten o'clock every
morning ; and sometimes he stayed till ten o'clock
at night, and sometimes he left as early as five in
the afternoon ; but he didn't live there no more
after the third year, when he was beginning to get
on a bit. There was his rooms, and there was nothing
altered, except that he took away his dressing-case
and a good many of his clothes ; but there was
everything left that he wanted for his toilet, and all
in apple-pie order for him to fall back upon his old
ways at any time. Only, as I said before, he didn't

live there no longer ; and instead of having his dinner
in his own room at seven o'clock, he never took
anything more than a biscuit and a glass of sherry,
or a brandy and soda."

Did this change in his habits come about suddenly
? "

Yes, sir, it did ; without an hour's warning. I
comes to his rooms one morning and finds that his
bed hasn't been slept in, and I finds a little bit of a
pencil note from him to say that he would be stopping
out of town for a few days. He was away over a
fortnight, and from that time to the end of my service
in Ferret Court, he never spent another night
there."

He had taken lodgings out of town, I conclude ?
I suppose you knew his other address?"

"No, sir, he never told me where his home was,
for of course he must have had a home somewhere.
No man would be a waif and stray
for all those years  above all, such a steady-going
gentleman as Mr. Dalbrook. I've heard
other gentlemen accuse him of being a hermit.
1 One never sees you nowhere they says. ' You're
as steady as Old Time,' they says. And so he

was ; but he was very secret with his steadiness."


Had you any idea where that second home of
his was  in what part of the suburbs ? It could
not have been very far from London, since you say
he came to his chambers before ten o'clock every
morning."

"It was oftener nine than ten, sir," said Mrs.
Dugget.

She paused a little before replying to his question,
watching him with a sly smile as he caressed
the obtrusive cat. She had her own notions
as to the motive of his curiosity. He had expectations
from Lord Cheriton, perhaps, and
he wanted to discover if there were anything in
the background of his kinsman's history which
was likely to interfere with the fruition of his
mercenary hopes.

It was a good many years after Mr. Dalbrook
left off sleeping at his chambers that I made a sort
of discovery," she said; " and I knew my place too
well to take any advantage of that discovery. But
still I had my suspicions, and I believe they were
not far off the truth."

What was the nature of your discovery ? "
Oh, well, you see, sir, it wasn't much to talk
about, only it set rue thinking. It was two or three
years before Mr. Dalbrook left Ferret Court and
went to that first floor set in King's Bench Walk,
but he was beginning to be a great man, and he had
more work than he could do, slave as hard as he
might ; and he did slave, I can tell you, sir. His
rooms in Ferret Court were very shabby  they
hadn't had a bit of paint or a pail of whitewash for
I don't know how long, so just before the Long
Vacation he says to me, ' I'm going to get these
rooms done up, Mrs. Dugget, while I'm out of
town. I've got a estimate from a party in
Lowborn, and he's to paint the wainscot and
clear coal the ceiling, and do the whole thing
for nine pounds seven and eighteen, in a
workmanlike manner. You'll please to clean up
after him, and do away with all the waste paper
and rubbish, and get everything tidy before November."


Mrs. Dugget paused, and refreshed herself with
half a cup of tea, and apologized for the obtrusiveness
of the cat.

I hope you don't object to cats, sir."

Theodore smiled, reflecting that any man who objected
to cats would have fled from that stuffy parlour
before now.

Xo, I am rather fond of them, as an inferior
order of clog. "Well, now, as to this discovery of
yours, Mrs. Dugget ? "

"I'm coming to it as fast as I can, sir. You
must know that there was a lot of waste paper in
one of the closets beside the fireplace, and you are
aware how roomy those closets in Ferret Court
are. I never held with burning waste paper, first
because it's dangerous with regard to fire, and next
because they'll give you three shillings a sack for
it at some of the paper mills ; so I had always
emptied the waste paper baskets into this closet,
which was made no other use of, and the bottom
of the closet was chock-full of old letters, envelopes,
pamphlets, and such like. So I took my sack, and
I sat down on the floor and filled it. Now, as I
was putting in the papers by handfuls  taking my
time over it, for the painters wasn't coming till
the following Monday, and all my gentlemen was
away on their holidays  I was struck by seeing

such a number of envelopes addressed to the same
name 

J. Danvers, Esq.,

Myrtle Cottage,

Camberwell Grove.

How did Mr. Dalbrook come to have all those envelopes
belonging to Mr. Danvers ? There must have
been letters inside the envelopes, and what business
had he with Mr. Danvers' letters ? "

They may have been letters bearing upon some
case on which he was engaged," said Theodore.

So they might, sir, but would he have the
letters ? " asked the laundress shrewdly.
Wouldn't that be the solicitor's business ? "

"You are right, Mrs. Dugget. I see you have
profited by your experience in the Temple."

I had the curiosity to look at the post-marks on
those envelopes, sir. There was over a hundred of
'em, I should think, some whole, and some torn
across, and the post-marks told me that they spread
over years. They most of 'em looked like tradesmen's
envelopes, and the Camberwell post-mark was
on a good many of 'em. That closet hadn't been

cleared out for eight or nine years, to my knowledge,
and those envelopes went back for the best
part of that time, and the longer I looked at them
the more I wondered who Mr. Danvers was."

And did you come to any conclusion at last? "

Well, sir, I had my own idea about it, but it
isn't my place to say what that idea was."

Come, come, Mrs. Dugget, you have no employer
now, and you are beholden to no one. You are a
free agent, and have a perfect right to give expression
to your opinion."

If I thought it would go no further, sir."

It shall go no further."

Very well then, sir, to be candid I thought
that James Dalbrook and J. Danvers, Esq., were
the same person, and that Mr. Dalbrook had been
living in Camberwell Grove under an assumed
name."

Would not that seem a very curious thing for a
professional man in Mr. Dalbrook' s position to do ? "
inquired Theodore, gravely.

It might seem curious to you, sir, but I've seen
a good deal of professional gentlemen in my time,
and it didn't strike me as very uncommon. Gentle-vol.

n. u

men have their own reasons for what they do, and
the more particular they are from a professional
point of view the more convenient they may find it
to make a little alteration in their names now and
again."

Mrs. Dugget looked at him with a significant
shrewdness, which gave her the air of a female
Mephistopheles, a creature deeply versed in all
things evil.

Did your curiosity prompt you to try and verify
your suspicions ? " he asked.

The old woman looked at him searchingly before
she answered, as if trying to discover what value
there might be for him in any information she had
it in her power to give or to withhold. So far she
had been carried along by her inherent love of gossip,
stimulated by the wish to stand well with her
daughter's employer, and perhaps with a view to
such small amenities as a pound of tea or a bottle of
whisky. But at this point something in Theodore's
earnest manner suggested to her that her knowledge
of his kinsman's life might have a marketable value,
and she therefore became newly reticent.

It doesn't become me to talk about a gentleman

like Mr. Dalbrook, your namesake and blood
relation, too, sir," she said, folding her rheumatic
hands meekly. "I'm afraid I've made too free with
my tongue already."

Theodore did not answer her immediately. Ho
took a letter-case from his breast-pocket, and slowly
and deliberately extracted two crisp bank-notes from
one of the divisions. These he opened and spread
calmly and carefully on the table, smoothing out
their crisp freshness, which crackled under his
hand.

There is something very pleasant in the aspect of
a new bank-note ; money created expressly, as it
were, for the first owner ; virgin wealth, pure and
uncontaminated by the dealings of the multitude.
These were only five-pound notes, it is true, the
lowest in the scale of English paper-money  in the
eye of a millionaire infinitesimal as the grains of
sand on the sea shore  yet to Mrs. Dugget those
two notes lying on the table in front of her suggested
vast wealth. It is doubtful if she had ever
seen two notes together in the whole of her previous
experience. Her largest payment was a quarter's
rent, her largest receipt had been a quarter's wages.

u 2

She had managed to save a little money in the
course of her laborious days, but her savings had
been accumulated in sovereigns and half-sovereigns,
which had been promptly transferred to the savings
bank. Bank-notes to her mind were the symbols of
surplus wealth.

Now, I am not going to beat about the bush,
Mrs. Dugget," said Theodore, with a matter-of-fact
air. " I have a great respect for my kinsman, Lord
Cheriton, who has been a kind friend to me. You
may be assured, therefore, that if I am curious
about his past life, I mean him no harm. I have
reasons of my own, which it is not convenient forme
to explain, for wanting to know all about his
early struggles, his friends, and his enemies. I
feel perfectly sure that you followed up your discovery
of those envelopes  that you took the trouble
to find Myrtle Cottage, and to ascertain the kind of
people who lived there." Her face told him that he
was right. " If you choose to be frank with me,
and tell me all you can, those two five-pound notes
are very much at your service. If you prefer to
hold your tongue, I can only wish you good afternoon,
and try to make my discoveries unaided, which

will not be very easy after a lapse of over twenty
years."

"I don't want to keep any useful information
from you, sir, provided you'll promise not to let
anything I may tell you get to Lady Ckeriton's ears.
I shouldn't like to make unhappiness between man
and wife."

I promise that Lady Cheriton shall not be made
unhappy by any indiscretion of mine."

That's all I care about, sir," said Mrs. Dugget,
piously, with her keen old eye upon the notes,
and being sure of that, I don't mind owning that
I did take the trouble to follow up the address upon
the envelope. Now, when a gentleman like Mr.
Dalbrook  a gentleman as always pays his way
regular, and stands high in his profession  when
such a gentleman as that changes his name, you
may be sure there's a lady in the case. If you take
up a paper, sir, and happen to glance at a divorce
case, promiscuous, as I do sometimes when my son-in-law
leaves his Telegraph or his Echo lying about
you'll find that the gentleman who runs away
with the lady always changes his name first thing 
whether he and the lady go to an hotel, or takes

lodgings, or go on the Continent  lie always takes
another name. I don't think the change does him
much good, for wherever he goes people seem to
know all about him, and come out with their
knowledge in court directly it's wanted  but it
seems as if he must always act so, and act so he
does."

Theodore submitted to this disquisition in silence,
but he touched the notes lightly with his fingers and
made them crackle, by way of stimulus to Mrs.
Dugget's intellect.

I felt sure if Mr. Dalbrook had been living at
Myrtle Cottage under the name of Danvers there
was a lady mixed up in it, and, being in the Long
Vacation, when I knew he generally went abroad,
I thought I would try and satisfy myself about him.
I thought I should feel more comfortable in waiting
upon him when I knew the worst. And then Camberwell
Grove was such a little way off. It would
Tee just a nice outing for me of a summer evening ;
so what did I do one lovely warm afternoon but take
my tea a little earlier than usual, and trot off to the
corner of Lancaster Place, where I wait for a
"Waterloo 'bus coming sauntering along the Strand

as if time was made for slaves, and there was no
such things as loop-lines or trains to be caught. I
hadn't no train to catch, so I didn't mind the
sauntering and the dawdling and the taking up and
setting down. I had all the summer evening before
me when I got out at the Green and made my way
to the Grove. It's a beautiful romantic place, Camberwell
Grove, sir. I don't know whether you know
it, but if you do I'm sure you'll own that there ain't
a prettier neighbourhood near London. Twenty
years ago they used still to show you the garden
where George Farewell murdered his uncle, but I
daresay that's been done away with by now. It took
me a good time to find Myrtle Cottage, for it was
one of the smallest houses in the Grove, and it
stood back in a pretty little garden, and there was
nothing on the gate to tell if it was Myrtle or otherwise.
But I did find it at last, thanks to a young
housemaid who was standing at the gate, talking to
a grocer's lad. The grocer's lad made off when he
saw me, and for the first few minutes the girl was
inclined to be disagreeable ; but she came round
very quickly, and I daresay she was glad to have
some one to talk to on that solitary summer evening.

Cook's out for her holiday,' she says, ' and I can't
stop in the house alone.' And then we got talking,
and after we'd talked a bit standing at the gate, she
asked me into the garden, where there was a long
narrow grass plot, screened off from the high road
by two horse-chestnut trees and some laburnums,
and there was some garden chairs and a table on the
grass, and the young woman asked me to sit down.
She'd got her work-basket out there, and she'd been
making herself an apron. * I can't bear the house
of a summer evening,' she says, * it gives me the
horrors.' Well, we talked of her master and mistress,
as was natural. She'd lived with them over a
twelvemonth, and it was a pretty good place, but
very dull, and the missus had a temper, and was
dreadfully particular, and expected things as nice as
if she had ten servants instead of two, and was
very mean into the bargain, and seemed afraid of
spending money. ' I shouldn't be so particular, if I
was her,' the girl said, and then she told me that
she knew things wasn't all right, though they
seemed a very respectable couple, and the lady went
to church regularly."

What made her suspect that things were

wrong ? " asked Theodore, Mrs. Dugget having
paused at this point of her narrative.

Oh, sir, servants always know. They can't
live six months in a house without finding out how
the land lies. They've got so little to think of, you
see, except their masters and mistresses. You can't
wonder if they're always on the watch and the listen ,
meaning no harm, poor things. If you was shut up
in a stuffy little kitchen all day, never seeing no one
but the lads from the tradespeople for two or three
minutes at a time, you'd watch and you'd listen.
It's human nature. People don't like reading servants,
and they don't like gadding servants ; so they
must put up with servants that think a good deal of
what's going on round them. The housemaid told
me she was sure from the solitary way Mr. and Mrs.
Danvers lived that there was a screw loose somewhere.
' No one never comes near them,' she said,
and she never goes nowhere except for a walk with
him. No visitors, no friends. I can't think how
she bears her life. She hasn't a party-gown, even.
If anybody asked her to a party she couldn't go.
When he took her abroad last month she was all ina
fluster and excitement, just like a child, or like a

prisoner that's going to be let out of prison. She
shook hands with cook and me when she said goodbye,
and that isn't like her. " I feel so happy,
Jane," she says, " I don't know what I'm doing."
No more I think she did. She looked quite wild
with pleasure, and quite young too in her new bonnet,
although in a general way she looks older than him.'
And then the girl told me how fond she was of him,
although she showed her temper now and then, even
to him. Not often, the girl said, and any quarrel
with him threw her into a dreadful way afterwards,
and she would lie awake and sob all night long.
The girl had heard her, for it was a trumpery little
house, though it was pretty to look at, and the walls
were very thin. I could see with my own eyes that
it wasn't much of a house, a sort of dressed-up cottage,
smothered with creepers up to the roof. It
looked pretty and countrified after the Temple, and
I could understand that Mr. Dalbrook liked living in
such a lovely place as Camberwell Grove."

"Did you find out what the lady was like?"
asked Theodore.

You may be sure I tried to do that, sir. How
could I help being interested in a lady that had such

an influence over one of my gentlemen ? The girl
told me that Mrs. Dan vers was one of the ' has
beens.' She had been handsome, perhaps, once
upon a time ; and she might have had a fine figure
once upon a time ; but she had neither face nor
figure now. She was pale and careworn, and she
was very thin. She didn't do anything to set herself
off either, like other ladies of five-and-thirty.
She wore the same merino gown month after month,
and she had only one silk gown in her wardrobe.
She was always neat and nice, like a lady ; but she
didn't seem to care much how she looked. She told
the girl once that she and Mr. Danvers would be
better off by and by, and then all things would be
different with them. ' I am only waiting for those
happier days,' she says ; but the girl fancied she
would be an old woman before those days came."

Were there any children ? "

I could not find out for certain. The girl
fancied from chance words she had overheard that
there had been a baby, but that it had been sent
away, and that this was a grievance between them,
and came up when they quarrelled, which was not
often, as I said before. Altogether I left Camberwell

Grove feeling very sorry for the lady who was
called Mrs. Dan vers, and I thought it was a great
pity if Mr. Dalbrook wanted to make a home for
himself he couldn't have managed it better. I
made great friends with Jane, the housemaid, before
I left that garden, and I asked her when she had an
evening out to come and take a cup of tea with me ;
and if she could get leave to go to the theatre, my
youngest son, who was living at home then, could
take her, along with my daughter, who was then
unmarried and in service in New Bridge Street.
The young woman came once, about Christmas
time, and she told me things were just the same as
they had been at Myrtle Cottage. She talked very
freely about Mr. and Mrs. Dan vers over her tea, but
she had no idea that he was known to me, or
that he was a barrister with chambers in the Temple.
She thought he was something in the City. I asked
her if it was Mr. Danvers who was mean and kept
his lady short of money ; but she thought not. She
thought it was Mrs. Danvers that had a kind of
mania for saving, for she was quite put out if Mr.
Danvers brought her home a present that cost a few
pounds. It seemed as if they were saving up for

some purpose  for they used to talk to each other
of the money he was putting by, and it was plain
they were looking forward to a better house and a
happier kind of life. Jane thought that either she
had a husband hidden away somewhere  in a lunatic
asylum, perhaps  or he had another wife."

Mrs. Dugget stopped to replenish the thrifty little
fire with a very small scornful of coals, during which
operation the sleek black cat leaped upon her back
and balanced himself upon her shoulders while she
bent over the grate.

Well, sir, that was Jane's first and last visit.
She got married all of a sudden before Lady day,
and she went to live in the country, where her husband
was postman in her native village, and I never
see no more of her. I went to Camberwell Grove
again in the Long Vacation, when I knew Mr. Dal-brook
was away, but I found only an old woman in
the house as caretaker, stone deaf, and disagreeable
into the bargain. Mr. Dalbrook moved into King's
Bench Walk the following year, and less than six
months after that I saw his marriage in the papers ;
and his clerk told me he had married a very rich
young lady, and was going to buy an estate in the

country. I went to have another look at the cottage
soon after Mr. Dalbrook's marriage, and I found the
garden-gate locked, and a board up to say that the
house was to he let .unfurnished ; and that, sir, is
all I could ever find out about the lady called Mrs.
Danvers."

"And this history of the home in Camberwell
G-rove is all you ever knew about Mr. James Dal-brook's
life outside the chambers in Ferret Court."

Yes, sir, that is all I ever heard, promiscuously
or otherwise."

Well, Mrs. Dugget, you have been frank with
me, and you have earned my little present," said
Theodore, handing her the two notes, which her old
fingers touched tremulously in a rapture that was
too much for words. It was with an effort that she
faltered out her thanks for his generosity, which,
she protested, she had never " looked for."

Theodore walked back towards the Temple deep
in thought ; indeed so troubled and perplexed were
his thoughts that upon approaching Ferret Court he
stopped short, and instead of going straight to his
chambers turned aside and went to the Gardens,
where he walked up and down the same gravel path

for an hour, pondering upon that picture of the
hidden home in Camberwell Grove, conjured up before
him by the loquacious laundress. Yes, he
could imagine that obscure existence almost as if he
had seen it with his bodily eyes. He could fancy
the solitary home where never kinsman or familiar
friend crossed the threshold ; a home destitute of
all home ties and homely associations ; a home
never smiled upon by the parson of the parish ; cutoff
from all local interests, identified with nothing, a
mystery among the common-place dwellings around
and about it ; a subject for furtive observation from
the neighbours. He could fancy those two lonely
lives preying upon each other, too closely united for
peaceful union ; the woman too utterly dependent
upon the man ; she feeling her dependence a degradation
; he feeling her helplessness a burden. He
could picture them, loving each other, perhaps,
passionately, jealously to the last, and yet weary
of each other, worn out and weighed down by the
narrowness of a life walled off from the rest of the
world and all its changeful interests and widening
sympathies. And then he saw the picture in still
darker colours, as it might have been ere that unknown

figure faded from the canvas. He thought
of the ambitious, successful barrister, heart sick at
the fetters which he had fastened upon his life, tired
of his faded mistress, seeing all gates open to him
were he but free to pass them ; still living apart
from the world, at a time of life when all the social
instincts are at their highest development, when a
man loves the society of his fellowmen, the friction
of crowds, the sound of his own voice, and every
social tribute that the world can offer to his
talents and his success. He saw his kinsman
galled by the chain which love and honour had
hung about him, loathing his bondage, longing for
liberty  saw him with the possibility of a brilliant
marriage suddenly offering itself to him, a lovely
girl ready to throw herself into his arms, a fortune
at his feet, and the keen ambition of a self-made
man goading him like a spur. How did it end ?
Did death set him free  death, the loosened of all
bonds? Or did his mistress sacrifice herself and
her broken heart to his welfare, and of her own
accord release him ? There are women capable of
such sacrifices. It would seem that his disentanglement,
however it came about, had been perfect of its

kind ; for no rumour of a youthful intrigue, no
scandal about a cast-off mistress had ever clouded
the married life of James Dalbrook. Even in
Cheriton village, where the very smallest nucleus in
the way of fact was apt to swell into a gigantic
scandal, even at Cheriton nobody had ever hinted
at indiscretions in the earlier years of the local magnate.


And then Theodore Dalbrook asked himself the
essential question : What bearing, if any, had this
episode of his kinsman's life upon the murder of
Juanita's husband ? What dark and vengeful figure
lurked in the background of that common story of
dishonourable love ? An outraged husband, a
brother, a father? That obscure life apart from
friends and acquaintances would show that some
great wrong had been done, some sacred tie had
been broken. Only a sinful union so hides its furtive
happiness  only a deep sense of degradation
will reconcile a woman to banishment from the
society of her own sex.

Whether that forsaken mistress were dead or
living there might lurk in her sad history the elements
of tragedy, the motive for a ghastly revenge ;

VOL. II. x

and on this account the story possessed a grim fascination
for Theodore Dalbrook. He lay awake the
greater part of the night thinking in a fitful way of
that illicit menage in the unfashionable suburb  the
suburb whose very existence is unknown to society.
He fell asleep long after the sun was up, only to dream
confusedly of a strange woman who was now James
Dalbrook' s lawful wife  and now his victim  and
whose face had vague resemblances to other faces,
and who was and was not half-a-dozen other women
in succession.

He walked to Camberwell on the following afternoon,
surprised at the strange world through which
he passed on his way there, the teeming, busy,
noisy world  the world which makes such a hard
fight for life. The Grove itself, after that bustling,
seething road, seemed a place in which nightingales
might have warbled, and laughing girls hidden from
their lovers in the summer dusk. The very atmosphere
of decay from a better state was soothing.
There were trees still, and gardens, and here and
there pretty, old-fashioned houses ; and in a long
narrow garden between two larger houses he found
Myrtle Cottage. There was a board up, and the

neglected garden indicated that the cottage had been
a long time without a tenant.

There was a policeman's wife living in it, with a
colony of small children, in the cotton-pinafore stage
of existence, and with noses dependent upon
maternal supervision, so much so that scarcely had
the matron attended to one small snub than her
attention was called off to another, which gave a
distracted air to all her conversation.

She took Mr. Dalbrook over the house, and
expatiated upon the damp walls, and the utter
incompetence of the cistern and pipes to meet the
exigencies of a family, which was the more to be
regretted on the ground that the landlord declined
to do anything in the way of repairs, as he intended
to pull the house down in a few years with a view to
making better use of the ground.

And indeed that's about all it's fit for," said
the policeman's wife. 'It ain't fit for anybody to
live in."

The rooms had even a more desolate look than
rooms in empty houses usually have, in consequence
of this long neglect. The cottage had been empty
for two years and a half, long enough for the

damp to make hideous blotches upon all the walls,
and trace discoloured maps of imaginary, continents
upon all the ceilings ; long enough for the spiders
to weave their webs in all the corners, for rust to
eat deep into the iron grates, and for dust and
dirt to obscure every window.

Theodore stood in the room which had once
been a drawing-room, and which boasted of a
wide French window looking out upon a lawn,
with a large weeping-ash directly in front of the
window, and much too near for airiness or health,
a melancholy looking tree in which Theodore
thought Mrs. Danvers might have found a symbol
of her own life, as she stood at the window and
looked at those dull drooping branches against a
background of ivy-covered wall.

'And if we do but watch the hour,
There never yet was human power

Which could evade, if unforgiven,
The patient search and "igil long
Of him who treasures up a wrong."

Theodore made a tour of the little garden in the
summer sundown. It was very small, but its age
gave it a superiority over most suburban gardens.
There were trees, and hardy perennials that had been
growing year after year, blooming and fading, with
very little care on the part of successive tenants.
The chief charm of the garden to some people
might have been its seclusion. There was no possibility
of being "overlooked" in this narrow
pleasaunce, and over-looking is the curse of

VOL. III. B

the average garden attached to the average villa.
Mr. and Mrs. Jones, taking their ease, or working
in their garden in the cool of the evening, are uncomfortably
conscious of Mr. and Mrs. Smith eyeing
them from the drawing-room windows of next door.

Here the high wall on one side, and the tall
horse-chestnuts on the other, made a perfect solitude
; but seclusion on a very small scale is apt to
merge into illness, and it must be owned that the
garden of Myrtle Cottage at sundown was about as
melancholy a place as the mind of man could
imagine. Theodore, contemplating it from the
standpoint of Mrs. Danvers' history, her friendlessness,
her sense of degradation, wondered that she
could have endured that dismal atmosphere for a
single summer. And she had lived there for many
years ; lived there till weariness must have become
loathing.

*' God help her, poor soul," he said to himself.
How she must have abhorred that weeping ash !
How it must have tortured her to see the leaves go
and come again year after year, and to know that
neither spring nor autumn would better her fate."

He took down the address of the accent who had

the letting of the house, and left with the intention
of seeing him that evening if possible. The landlord
was a personage resembling the Mikado, or the
Grand Llama, and was not supposed to be accessible
to the human vision, certainly not in relation to his
house property. The policeman's wife averred that
** him and the De Crespignys owned half Camberwell."


The agent was represented to live over his office,
which was in no less famous a locality than camberwell
Green, and was likely, therefore, to oblige Mr.
Dalbrook by seeing him upon a business matter
after business hours. It was not much past seven
when Theodore entered the office, where he found
the agent extending his business hours so far as to
be still seated at his desk, deep in the revision of a
catalogue. He was a very genial agent, and he put
aside the catalogue immediately, asked Theodore to
be seated, and wheeled round his office chair to talk
to him.

Myrtle Cottage. Yes, a charming little box,
convenient and compact, a bijou residence for a
bachelor with a small establishment. Such a nice
garden, too, retired and rustic. If you were think

2

ing of taking the property on a repairing lease, the
rent would be very moderate, really a wonderfully
advantageous occasion for any one wanting a pretty
secluded place."

** To tell you the truth, Mr. Adkins, I am not
thinking of taking that house or any house. I have
come to ask you a few questions about a former
tenant, and I shall take it as a favour if you will be
so good as to answer them'*

The agent looked disappointed, but he put his pen
behind his ear, crossed his legs, and prepared himself
for conversation.

Do you mean a recent tenant ? " he asked.

** No ; the gentleman I am interested in left
Myrtle Cottage twenty years ago  nearer five-and-twenty
years, perhaps. His name was Dan vers."

The agent gave a suppressed whistle, and looked
at his interlocutor with increasing interest.

Oh, you wanted to know something about Mr.
Danvers. Was he an acquaintance of yours ? "

He was."

*' Humph ! He is more than old enough to be
your father. He might almost be your grandfather.
Do you know him intimately?"

"As intimately as a man of my age can know a
man of his age."

"And position," added the agent, looking at his
visitor shrewdly.

Theodore returned the look.

I don't quite follow your meaning," he said.

** Come, now, sir, if you know anything at all
about the gentleman in question you must know
that his name is not Danvers, and never was Danvers
; that he took Myrtle Cottage under an assumed
name, and lived there for nearly ten years under
that assumed name ; that he never let any of his
friends or acquaintances cross his threshold ; and
that he thought he had hoodwinked me, me a man
of the world, moving about in the world, among
other men of the world. Why, sir, Mr. Danvers
had not paid me three half-years' rent in notes or
gold, as he always paid, and in this office here 
before I had found out that he was the rising barrister,
Mr. Dalbrook  and before I had guessed the reason
of his hole-and-corner style of life."

What became of the lady who was called Mrs.
Danvers?"

"And who in all probability was Mrs. Danvers,"

said Mr. Adkins. " I have reason to believe that
was her name. What became of her ? God knows.
A servant came to me one August morning with the
keys and a half-year's rent  the tenant had given
notice to surrender at the Michaelmas quarter, that
being the quarter at which he entered upon possession.
Mr. and Mrs. Dan vers had gone abroad;
to Belgium, the woman thought ; and as it was
their present intention to live abroad, their furniture
had all been removed to the Pantechnicon upon the
previous day, and the house was empty, and at my
disposal."

"Did you hear nothing more of them after
that?"

I heard of him, sir, as all the world heard of
him  heard of his marriage with a wealthy young
Spanish lady, heard of his elevation to the peerage
but of Mrs. Danvers I never heard a syllable. I
take it she was pensioned off, and that she lived 
and may have died  on the Continent. Why, there
are a lot of sleepy old Flemish towns  I'm a bit of
a traveller in my quiet way  which seem to have
been created for that purpose."

"Is that all you can tell me about your tenants,

Mr. Atkins ? I am not prompted Lv idle curiosity
in my inquiries. I Lave a very strong motive "

*' Don't trouble yourself to explain, sir. I know
nothing about Mr. or Mrs. Danvers which I have
any desire to hold back  or which I am under any
obligation to keep back. My business relations with
the gentleman never went beyond letting him Myrtle
Cottage, which I let to him without a reference, on
the strength of a twelve month's rent in advance, and
a deuce of a hurry he was in to get into the place.
As for Mrs. Danvers, you may be surprised to hear
that I never saw her face. I'm not a prying
person, and as the rent was never overdue, I had
no occasion to call at the house. But I did see
some one who had a strong bearing upon the lady's
life, and a very troublesome customer that person
was."

*' Who was he?"

*' No less an individual than her husband. A
man dashed into this office one winter afternoon, a
little after dusk, and asked me if I had let a house
to a person called Danvers ? I could see that he
had been drinking, and that he was in a state of
strong excitement ; so I answered him shortly

enough, and I kept him well between myself and
the door, so as to be able to pitch him out if he got
troublesome. He told me that he'd just come from
Myrtle Cottage, that he had been refused admittance
there, although the woman who lived there was his
wife. He wanted to know if the house had been
taken by her, or by the scoundrel who passed himself
off as her husband ? If it had been taken in her
name it was his house, and he would very soon let
them know that he had the right to be there. I
told him that I knew nothing about him or his
rights ; that my client's tenant was Mr. Danvers,
and that there the business ended. He was very
violent upon this, abused the tenant, talked about
his own wrongs and his wife's desertion of him,
asked me if I knew that this man who called himself
Danvers was an impostor, who had taken the house
in a false name, and who was really a beggarly barrister
called Dalbrook ; and then from blasphemy
and threatening he fell to crying, and sat in my
office shivering and whimpering like a half-demented
creature, till I took compassion upon him so far as
to give him a glass of brandy, and send my office
lad out with him to put him into a cab."

*' Did he tell you his name or profession ? "
*'No, he was uncommonly close about himself.
I asked him if the lady's name was really Danvers,
and if he was Mr. Danvers ; but he only stared at
me in a vacant way with his drunken eyes. It was
hopeless trying to get a straight answer from him
about anything. Heaven knows how he got home
that night, for he wouldn't tell the office boy his
address, and only told the cabman to drive to Lowborn.
* I'll pull him up when I get there,' he said.
He may have been driven about half the night, for
all I can tell."

Was that all you ever saw or heard of him ? "
*' All I ever saw, but not all I ever heard. Servants
and neighbours will talk, you see, sir, and I
happened to be told of three or four occasions  at
considerable intervals  at which my gentleman
made unpleasantness at Myrtle Cottage. He would
go there wild with drink  I believe he never went
when he was sober  and would kick up a row. If
he wanted to get his wife away from the life she was
leading he would have gone to work in a different
manner ; but it's my opinion he wanted nothing of
the kind. He was savage and vindictive in his

cups, ant lie wanted to frighten her and to annoy
the man who had tempted her away from him.
Bat he was a poor creature, and after blustering and
threatening he would allow himself to be thrust
out of doors like a stray cur."

What kind of a man did he look? A broken-down
gentleman ? "

Yes, I should say he had been a gentleman
once, but he had come down a longish way. He
had come down as low as drink and dissipation can
bring a man. Altogether I should consider him a
dangerous customer."

'' A man capable of violence  of crime even ? "

*' Perhaps ! A man who wouldn't have stopped
at crime if he hadn't been a white-livered hound.
I tell you, sir, the fellow was afraid of Mr. Dal-brook,
although Mr. Dalbrook ought to have been
afraid of him. He was a craven to the core of his
heart."

"What age did you give him ? "

'' At the time he came to me I should put him
down at about six and thirty,"

And that is how many years ago ? ''

Say four-and-twenty  I can't be certain to a

year or so. It wasn't a business transaction, and I
haven't any record of the fact."

*' Was he a powerful-looking man ? "
He was the remains of a powerful man  he
must have been a fine man when he was ten years
younger  a handsome man, too  one of those fair-complexion,
blue-eyed, aquiline-nosed men who
set off good clothes  the kind of man to do justice
to a rig out from a fashionable tailor. He was a
wreck when I saw him, but he was the wreck of a
handsome man."

*' And you take it that he was particularly vindictive
? "

He was as vindictive as a cur can be."
*' And was his anger strongest against the lady,
do you suppose, or against the gentleman ? "

*' Decidedly against the gentleman. He was full
of envy and hatred and all uncharitableness towards
Mr. Dalbrook. He affected to think contemptuously
of his talents, and to belittle him in every
way, while he was bursting with envy at his growing
success. He was jealous and angry as a husband,
no doubt ; but he was still more jealous and
still angrier as a disappointed man against a successful

man. He was as venomous as conscious
failure can be. And now, sir, that I have spoken so
freely about this little domestic drama, which was
all past and done with twenty years ago, and in
which I only felt interested as a man of the world,
now may I ask your name, and how you come to be
so keenly interested in so remote an event ? "

My name is Dalbrook," replied Theodore, taking
out his card and laying it upon the agent's desk.

You don't mean to say so ! A relation of Lord
Cheriton's?"

His cousin, a distant cousin, but warmly
attached to him and  his. The motive of my
inquiry need be no secret. A dastardly murder
was committed last summer in Lord Cheriton's
house '*

Yes, I remember the circumstances."

**A seemingly motiveless murder; unless it was
the act of some secret foe  foe either of the man
who was killed  or of his wife's father, Lord Cheriton.
I have reason to know that the young man
who was killed had never made an enemy. His life
was short and blameless. Now, a malignant cur,
such as the man you describe  a man possessed by

the devil of drink  would be just the kind of creature
to assail the strong man through his defenceless
daughter. To murder her husband was to
break her heart, and to crush her father's hopes.
This man may have discovered long beforehand how
my cousin had built upon that marriage  how
devoted he was to his daughter, and how ambitious
for her. Upon my soul I believe that you have
given me the clue. If we are to look for a blind
unreasoning hatred  malignity strong enough and
irrational enough to strike the innocent in order to
get at the guilty  I do not think we can look for it
in a more likely person than in the husband of Mrs.
Danvers."

"Perhaps not," said Mr. Adkins, keenly interested,
yet dubious. " But, granted that he is the
man, how are you to find him ? It is about four-and-twenty
years since he stood where you are
standing now, and I have never set eyes on him
from that day to this  close upon a quarter of a
century. I can't tell you his calling, or his
kindred, the place where he lived, or even the name
he bore, with any certainty. Danvers may have
been only an assumed name  or it may have been

his name. There's no knowing  or rather there's
only one person likely to be able to help you in the
matter, and that is Lord Cheriton."

** It would be difficult to question him upon such
a subject."

Of course it would ; and I don't suppose that
even he has taken the trouble to keep himself
posted in the movements of that very ugly customer.
Having shunted the lady he wouldn't be
likely to concern himself about the gentleman."

**A quarter of a century'' said Theodore, too
thoughtful to give a direct answer. *' Yes, it must
be very difficult to trace any man after such an
interval ; but if that man went to Cheriton Chase
he must have left some kind of trail behind him,
and it will go hard with me if I don't get upon that
trail. I thank you, Mr. Adkins, for the most valuable
information I have obtained yet, and if any
good comes of it you shall know. Good night."

Good night, sir. I shall be very glad to aid in
the cause of justice. Yes, I remember the Cheriton
Chase murder, and I should like to see the mystery
cleared up."

Upon a tone,
A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,
And his cheek change tempestuously . . .
But she in these fond feelings had no share ;
Her sighs were not for him ; to her he was
Even as a brother  but no more."

After that conversation with the house-agent,
the idea that he had found the clue to the Cheriton
Chase mystery took root in Theodore Dalbrook's
mind. Taking as his starting-point the notion of a
deadly hatred wreaking itself in an indirect revenge,
there seemed no more likely figure for the role of
avenger than that of the wronged and deserted husband.
The one startling improbability in this view
of the case was the long interval between the bus-hand's
appearance at Myrtle Cottage and the date
of the murder ; but even this difficulty Theodore
was able to account for upon the hypothesis of a
gradual perversion, a descent from vice to crime, as
the man's nature hardened under tle corrupting

influence of a profligate life, while the old festering
sore grew into a malignant canker, under the lash
of misery. He had seen in that great seething
cauldron of London life men whose countenances
lore the stamp of a degradation so profound that
the most ferocious crime might seem the normal
outcome of their perverted natures. He could
imagine how the broken-down gentleman, steeped
in drink, and embittered by the idea of wrongs
which had been the natural consequence of his own
misconduct, had sunk step by step upon the ladder
of vice, till he had arrived at that lowest deep
where the dreams of men are stained with blood
and darkened by the shadow of the hangman. He
could imagine such a man brooding over his wrongs
for long years, nursing his jealous wrath as the one
touch of manliness that survived in him  until
some newspaper description of the Dalbrook and
Carmichael wedding reminded him of the bitter contrast
between his own lot and that of his rival, and,
lashed into sudden fury, he set out upon his murderous
errand, hardly caring whom he murdered so
long as he could hurt the man he hated.

The very fact that Mrs. Danvers' husband had

been described as a craven, made the idea of his
guilt more likely. Only a coward would have chosen
such a revenge ; only a coward could have stretched
out his hand from the darkness to kill a man who
had never injured him. The crime was the crime of
a coward or a madman ; and this man, brutaUzed by
drink, may have been both madman and coward.

Here at least was a man closely associated with
James Dalbrook's life, and having good cause to
hate him. In the darkness surrounding the murder
of Godfrey Carmichael this was the first flash of
light.

And having arrived at this point Theodore Dal-brook
saw himself face to face with a new and
seemingly insurmountable difficulty. To follow this
clue to the end, to bring the crime home to the husband
of Lord Cheriton's cast-off mistress, was to
expose the history of the great man's earlier years
to the world at large, to offer up a reputation which
had hitherto been stainless as a rich and savoury
repast to that carrion brood  consisting of almost
everybody  which loves to feast upon garbage. How
the evening newspapers would revel in the details of
such a story  what denunciations  Yhat gloating

VOL. III. c

over the weakness of a strong man's life. How the
contents bills would bristle with appetizing headings,
how the shrill-voiced newsboys would yell their
startling particulars, their latest developments of
the Cheriton Chase Scandal.

This must all inevitably follow upon the discovery
of the murderer, if the murderer were indeed the
injured husband. There could be no possible escape
from that glare of publicity, that swelling symphony
of slander. From the moment the law laid its hand
upon the criminal the case would pass beyond individual
control, and individual interests and reputations
would become as nought. Justice would have
to do its work, and in the doing of it must needs
afford the usual fine opportunity to the newspapers.
Theodore thought with horror of such humiliation
coming upon Lord Cheriton, and through him upon
Juanita, who loved her father with a reverential
affection, and who was intensely proud of his
character and position. He thought of gentle Lady
Cheriton, who adored her husband, and who doubtless
would be made miserable by the knowledge that
his first love had been given to another woman,
whom he had loved well enough to sacrifice honour

for the sake of that illicit Into. What agony to that
single-minded, trusting creature to find that dark
spot upon her husband's past, and to know that the
daughter's happiness had been blighted because of
the father's sin.

r With these considerations in his mind it seemed
to Theodore that it would be better to halt on the
very threshold of discovery ; and yet there was the
appalling thought of further possibilities in the way
of crime  of a madman's revenge carried a stage
further, a madman's pistol aimed at the defenceless
mother or the unconscious child. What was he todo
? Was there no alternative between inaction and
such action as must speedily set in motion the
machinery of the law, and thus deprive him of all
free will in the future conduct of the case ?

Yes, there was an alternative course. If he were
once assured of the identity of the assassin, it might
be in his power to lay hands upon him, and to place
him under such circumstances of control in the
future as would ensure Juanita's safety, and render
any further crime impossible. If the man were mad,
as Theodore thought more than likely, he might be
quietly got into an asylum. If he were still master

c 2

of his actions he might he got abroad, to the remotest
colony in the Antipodes. The knowledge of
his crime would be a hold over him, a lever which
would remorse him to the uttermost ends of the earth,
if need were. This would be an illegal compromise,
no doubt  unjustifiable in the eye of the law  but
if it ensured Juanita's safety, and saved her father's
character, the compromise was worth making. It
was, indeed, the only way by which her security and
her father's good name could be provided for.

To arrive at this result he had to find the man
who had appeared in Mr. Adkins' office about four-and-twenty
years ago, and of whose subsequent
existence he, Theodore, had no knowledge.

' I must begin at the other end," he told himself.
*' If that man was the murderer, he must have been
seen in the neighbourhood. It is not possible that
he could have come to the place, and watched for his
opportunity, and got clear off after the deed was
done without being seen by human eyes."

And yet there remained the fact that the local
policeman and a London detective had both failed
in obtaining the faintest trace of a suspicious-looking
stranger, or indeed of any stranger, male or

female, who had been observed in the neighbourhood
of Cheriton before or after the murder; there remained
the fact that a large reward had been offered without
resulting in one scrap of information bearing upon
the subject. How could he hope, in the face of
these facts, to trace the movements of a man whose
personal appearance was unknown to him, and who
had come and gone like a shadow ?

I can but try, and I can but fail," he told himself.
" Knowing what I know now, I cannot remain
inactive."

It may be that he had caught something of the
fiery eagerness which consumed Juanita, that in his
ardent desire to be worthy of her regard, to waste
his life in her service, he had become, as it were, inoculated
with the spirit of his mistress, and hoped
as she hoped, and thought as she thought.

With the beginning of the Long Vacation he went
to Dorchester, but this time not alone. He took his
friend Cuthbert Ramsay with him, as a visitor to the
grave old house, in the grave old town.

His sisters often made a complaint against him
that he never introduced any of his college friends
to them  that whereas the sisters of other University

men were rich in the acquaintance of Charlies and
Algernons, and Frets and Toms, who were producible
at tennis parties and available for picnics at
the shortest notice, they were restricted to the youths
of Dorchester and a horizon bounded by the country
houses of the immediate neighbourhood. Remembering
these reproaches, and seeing that his friend
Ramsay was obviously pining for rest and country
air, Theodore suggested that he should occupy the
bachelor's room in Cornhill as long as he could
venture to stop away from hospitals and lectures
and scientific investigations.

*you want a long fallow, Cuthbert," he said,
*' and you couldn't have a better lotus island than
Dorchester. There's not an excitement or a feverish
sensation to be had within twenty miles, and then I
really want to make you known to my cousin. Lord
Cheriton. He is a very clever man  an all-round
man  and he would be interested in you and all that
you are doing."

**I shall be proud of knowing him. And then
there is your cousin. Lady Carmichael. I am deeply
interested in her, without having ever seen her face,
and when I do see her ' '

** You will say she is one of the loveliest women
you ever saw in your life, Cuthbert. I have no doubt
of that. You will see her beauty under a cloud, for
she is not one of those women who begin to get over
the loss of a husband as soon as their crape gets
rusty ; but her beauty is all the more touching on
account of the grief that separates her from all other
women  even from her past self. I sometimes look
at her and wonder if this sad and silent woman can
be the Juanita I once knew ; the light-hearted, spontaneous
girl, a buoyant creature, all impulse and
caprice, fancy and imagination."

'' You may be sure that I shall admire her, and
you may be sure I shall not forget that there is
some one whose admiration has a deeper root than
the lust of the eye and the fancy of the moment."

Theodore would not affect to misunderstand him.
It was not possible that he could have talked of his
cousin in the freedom of friendship without having
revealed his secret to his friend.

My dear fellow," he said with a sigh. " mine is
a hopeless case. You will know that it is so when
you see Juanita and me together. Her mother said
to me on the first day of this year, * If ever she

comes to care for anybody it will be some new person
; ' and I have not the least doubt that her mother
was right. Her first love was her playfellow, the
companion of her girlhood. A woman cannot have
two such loves. Her second attachment, if she ever
make one, will be of a totally different character."

*who knows, Theodore? A woman's heart is
to be measured by no callipers that I know of; it is
subject to no scientific test ; we cannot say it shall
give this or that result. It may remain cold as
marble to a man through years of faithful devotion,
and then, in an instant, the marble may change to a
volcano, and hidden fires may leap out of that seeming
coldness. * Nil desperado ' should be the
motto of all inventors  and of all lovers."

Dorchester, and especially the old house in Corn-hill,
received Mr. Ramsay with open arms. Harrington
was in the dejected state of a young man
who has been rudely awakened from youth's sweetest
delusion. Fooled and forsaken by Juliet Baldwin
he had told himself that all women are liars, and
was doing all in his power to establish his reputation
as a woman-hater. In this temper of mind he was
not averse from his own sex, and he welcomed his

brother's friend with unaffected cordiality, and was
evidently cheered by the new life which Ramsay's
vivacity brought into the quiet atmosphere of home.

The sisters were delighted to do honour to a
scientific man, and were surprised, on attacking Mr.
Ramsay at dinner with the ease and aplomb of 
in modern science, to discover one of two
things  either that he knew nothing, or that they
knew very little. They were at first inclined to the
former opinion, but it gradually dawned upon them
that their own much-valued learning was of a very
elementary character, and that their facts were for
the most part wrong. Chastened by this discovery,
they allowed the conversation to drift into lighter
channels, and never again tackled Mr. Ramsay
either upon the broad and open subject of evolution,
or the burning question of the cholera bacillus.
They were even content to leave him to the enjoyment
of his own views upon spontaneous generation
and the movement of glaciers, instead of setting
him right upon both subjects, as they had intended
in the beginning of their acquaintance.

He is remarkably handsome, but horribly dogmatic,"
Sophia told her brother, " and I'm afraid he

belongs to the showy, shallow school which has
arisen since the death of Darwin. He would hardly
have dared to talk as he did at dinner during Darwin's
lifetime."

Perhaps not, if Darwin had been omnipresent."

** Oh, there is a restraining influence in the very
existence of such a man. He is a perpetual court
of appeal against arrogant smatterers."

*' I don't think you can call a man who took a
first class in science a smatterer, Sophy. However,
I'm sorry you don't like my friend."

I like him well enough, but I am not imposed
upon by his dogmatism."

The two young men drove to Milbrook Priory on
the following day, Theodore feeling painfully eager
to discover what change the last few months had
made in Juanita. She had been in Switzerland,
with Lady Jane and the baby, living first at Grindelwald,
and hater in one of those little villages on the
shores of the lake of the forest cantons, which combine
the picturesque and the dull in a remarkable
degree  a mere cluster of chalets and cottages at
the foot of the Rigi, facing the monotonous beauty
ef the lake, and the calm grandeur of snow-capped

mountains, which shut in that tranquil corner of the
earth and shut out all the huss world beyond it.
Nowhere else had Juanita felt that deep sense of
seclusion, that feeling of being remote from the
din and press of life.

And now she was again at the Priory. She had
settled down there in her new position, as widow
and mother, a woman for whom all life's passionate
story was over, who must live henceforward for that
new life growing day hy day towards that distant
age of passion and of sorrow through which she
had passed suddenly and briefly, crowding into a
month the emotions of a lifetime. There are
women who have lived to celebrate their golden
wedding who in fifty years of wedlock have not felt
half her sum of love, and who in losing the companion
of half a century have not felt half her sum
of grief. It is the capacity for loving and suffering
which differs in different people, and weighed against
that Time counts but little.

She received her cousin with all her old friendliness.
She was a little more cheerful than when
last they met, and he saw that the new interest of
her life had done good. Lady Jane was at Swanage,

and Juanita was alone at the Priory, though not
without the expectation of company a little later in
the year, as the sisters and their husbands were to
be with her before the first of October, so that the
expense of pheasant-breeding might not be altogether
wasted.

'' You must be here as much as you can in
October, Theodore," she said, '* and help me to
endure Mr. Grenville and Mr. Morningside. One
talks nothing but sport, and the other insists upon
teaching me the science of politics."

She received Cuthbert Ramsay with a serious
sweetness which charmed him. Yes, she was verily
beautiful among women, exceptionally beautiful.
Those southern eyes shone star-like in the settled
pallor of her face, and her whole countenance was
etherealized by thought and grief. It touched the
stranger to see how she struggled to put away the
memory of her sorrow and to receive him with all
due hospitality  how she restrained herself as she
showed him the things that had been a part of her
dead husband's existence, and told him the story of
the old house which had sheltered so many generations
of Carmichael.

Lady Clarion had been lunching at the Priory,
where she came at least twice a week to watch her
grandson's development in all those graces of mind
and person which marked his superiority to the
average baby. She came all the oftener because of
the difficulty in getting Juanita to Cheriton.

'* My poor child will hardly ever visit us," she
told Theodore, as they sauntered on the lawn while
Juanita was showing Mr. Ramsay the pictures in
the dining-room. " She has an insurmountable
horror of the house she was once so fond of ; and I
can't wonder at it, and I can't be angry with her. I
have seen how painfully her old home affects her, so
I don't worry her to come to us often. I make a
point of getting her there once in a way in the hope
of overcoming her horror of the place as time goes
by ; and I have even gone out of my way to make
changes in the furniture and decorations, so that
the rooms should not look exactly the same as they
looked in her fatal honeymoon ; but I can see in her
face that every corner of the house is haunted for
her. Once when she had been calm and cheerful
with me for a whole afternoon, walking about the
garden and going from room to room, she flung herself

into my arms suddenly, sobbing passionately.
We were so happy, mother,' she said, * so happy
in this fatal house.' We must bear with her, poor
girl. God has given her a dark lot."

Theodore had seen an anxious, questioning look in
Juanita's eyes from the beginning of this visit, and
he took the first opportunity of being alone with
her, while Lady Cheriton entertained Mr. Ramsay
with an exposition of the merits of her grandson,
who was calmly slumbering in a hammock on
the lawn, unconscious of her praises, and half
smothered in embroidered coverlets.

Have you found out anything ? " she asked,
eagerly, as soon as they were out of ear shot.

*' Yes, I believe I have really come upon a clue,,
and that I may ultimately discover the murderer ;
but I can give you no details as yet  the whole
thing is too vague."

How clever of you to succeed where the police
have utterly failed. Oh, Theodore, you cannot
imagine how I shall value you  how deeply grateful
"

Stop, Juanita, for Heaven's sake don't praise
me. I may be chasing a Will-o'-the-wisp. I don't

suppose that any experienced detective would take
up such a clue as I am going to follow  only you
have set me to do this thing, and it has become the
business of my life to obey you."

You are all that is good. Pray tell me everything
you have discovered  however vague your
ideas may be."

No, Juanita, I can tell you nothing yet. You
must trust me, dear. I am at best only on the
threshold of a discovery. It may be long before I
advance another step. Be content to know that I
am not idle."

She gave an impatient sigh.

*' It is so hard to be kept in the dark," she said.
I dream night after night that I myself am on the
track of his murderer  sometimes that I meet him
face to face  oh, the hideous paid face  the face of
a man who has been hanged and brought to life
again. It is always the same kind of face  the
same dull livid hue  though it differs as to features,
though the man is never the same. You cannot
imagine the agony of those dreams, Theodore. Lay
that ghost for me, if you can. Make my life peaceful,
though it can never be happy."

Never is a long word, Nita. As the years go by
your child's love will give life a new colour."

*eyes, he is very dear. He has crept into my
heart, little nestling unconscious thing  knowing
nothing of my love or my sorrow, and yet seeming
to comfort me. I sometimes think my darling's
spirit looks out of those clear eyes. They seem so
full of thought  of thought far beyond human
wisdom."

Theodore could see that the work of healing was
being done, slowly but surely. The gracious influence
of a new love was being exercised, and the
frozen heart was reviving to life and warmth under
the soft touch of those baby fingers. He saw his
cousin smile with something of the old brightness
as she stood by while Cuthbert Kamsay dandled the
little lord of Carmichael Priory in his great strong
arms, smiling down at the tiny pink face peeping
out of a cloud of lace and muslin.

** Any one can see that Mr. Ramsay is fond of
children," said Lady Cheriton approvingly, as if a
liking for infants just short-coated were the noblest
"virtue of manhood.

Oh, I am fond enough of the little beggars,"

answered Cuthbert, lightly. *' All the gutter brats
about St. Thomas's know me, and hang on to my
coat-tails as I go by. I like to look at a child's face
those old shrewd London faces especially  and
speculate upon the life that lies before those younglings,
the things those eyes are to see, the words
those lips are to speak. Life is such a tremendous
mystery, don't you know  one can never be tired of
wondering about it. But this fellow is going to be
very happy, and a great man in the land. He is
going to belong to the new order, the order of rich
who go through life shoulder to shoulder with the
poor ; the redressed of wrongs, the adjusters of
social levels."

"I hope you are not a Socialist, Mr. Ramsay?"
said Lady Cheriton, with an alarmed air.

Not much ; but I acknowledge that there are
points where my ideas touch the boundary line of
Socialism. I don't want impossibilities. I have no
dream of a day when there shall be no more millionaires,
no great patrons of art or great employers of
labour, but only a dead level of small means and
shabby dwellings, and sordid colourless lives. No,
there must be butterflies as well as ants  if it were

VOL. III. D

only that the ants may have something pretty to
look at. What I should like to see is a stronger
bond of friendship and sympathy between the two
classes  a real knowledge and understanding of each
other between rich and poor, and the twin demons
Patronage and Sycophancy exorcised for ever and
ever."

The tea-tables were brought out upon the lawn by
this time ; Sir Godfrey Carmichael was carried off
by his nurse ; and the two young men sat down
with Lady Cheriton and her daughter under the
tree beneath which Juanita and her husband had
sat on that one blissful day which they had spent
together at the Priory as man and wife. They
seemed a very cheery and pleasant quartette as they
sat in the sultry afternoon atmosphere, with the
level lawn and flower-beds stretching before them,
and the wide belt of old timber shutting out all the
world beyond. Cuthbert Ramsay was the chief
talker, full of animal spirits, launching the wildest
paradoxes, the most unorthodox opinions. The
very sound of his strong full voice, the very ring of
his buoyant laugh, were enough to banish gloomy
thoughts and sad memories.

Lady Cheriton was delighted with this new acquaintance
; first because he was dexterous in handling
a baby ; next on the score of general merits.
She was not a deeply read person, but she had a
profound respect for culture in other people ; and
she had an idea that a scientific man was a creature
apart, belonging to a loftier world than that which
she and her intellectual equals inhabited. Theodore
had told her of his friend's claims to distinction,
his hard work in several cities, and seeing this earnest
worker boyish and light-hearted, interested in the
most frivolous subjects, she was lost in wonder at
his condescension.

She begged him to go to Cheriton with Theodore
at the earliest opportunity  an invitation which he
accepted gladly.

I have long wished to know Lord Cheriton," he
said.

The two young men left soon after tea. Cuthbert's
high spirits deserted him at the Priory gates, and both
men were thoughtful during the homeward drive.

Well, Cuthbert, what do you think of my cousin,
now that you have seen her ? " Theodore asked,
when he had driven the first mile.

D 2

I can only agree with you, my dear fellow. She
is a very lovely woman. I think there could hardly
be two opinions upon that point."

** And do you think  as I do  that it is hopeless
for any man to spend his life in worshipping her ?
Do you think her heart is buried with her dead
husband?"

Only as Proserpine was buried with Pluto. It
is not in human nature for so young a woman to
wear her weeds for a lifetime. The hour of revival
must come sooner or later. She has too bright and
quick an intellect to submit to the monotony of an
inconsolable sorrow. Her energy expends itself now
in the desire to avenge her husband's death. Failing
in that, her restless spirit will seek some new
outlet. She is beginning to be interested in her
child. As that interest grows with the child's
growth, her horizon will widen. And then, and
then, when she has discovered that life can still be
beautiful, her heart will become accessible to a new
love. The cure and the change, the awakening from
death to life, may be slower than it is in most such
cases, because this woman is the essence of sincerity,
and all her feelings lie deep. But the awakening

will come  you may be sure of that. Wait for it,
Theodore, possess your soul in patience."

You can afford to be philosophical," said the
other, with a sigh. " You are not in love ! "

True, my friend. No doubt that makes a difference."


And one, an English home  gray twilight poured
On dewy pastures, dewy trees.
Softer than sleep  all things in order stored,
A haunt of ancient Peace."

Theodore and his friend betook themselves to
Cheriton Chase on the following Friday, for that
kind of visit which north country people describe as
** a week end." They carried their portmanteaux
in that portion of the dog-cart which is more
legitimately occupied by a leash of spaniels or Irish
setters, and they arrived in the golden light of the
afternoon, just when that sunk lane approaching the
west gate was looking its loveliest. Hart's-tongue
and rocky boulder, the great brown trunks of the
oaks and the polygonum growing amidst their
cloven branches were all touched with sun-gleams,
while evening shadows lay soft and cool upon the
tall flowering grasses in the meadows on either side
of the deep gully.

That is Mrs. Porter's cottage," said Theodore,
indicating the gate-keeper's house with a turn of
his whip towards the end of the lane where the
clustered chimneys showed through a gap in the
trees.

Ramsay had been introduced to Miss Newton, and
had constituted himself honorary surgeon and
medical adviser to that lady and all her humble
friends. He had been invited to the tea parties in
Wedgewood Street, and had interested himself in
the young woman called Marian, and in her probable
identity with the lodge-keeper's missing
daughter, for which reason he had a keen desire to
make the lodge-keeper's acquaintance.

'' From your account of the lady she must be a
piece of human adamant," he said. " I like to
tackle that kind of individual. I've met a few of
them, and I'm happy to say that if I haven't been
able to melt them I've generally succeeded in making
them smart. I should enjoy exhibiting my
moral aquafortis in the case of this lady. I shall
get you to accompany me in a morning call upon
her while we are at Cheriton."

My dear Cuthbert, I would sooner call, uninvited

and without credentials, upon the Archbishop
of Canterbury. I don't forget how she froze me
when I tried to be friendly with her last New Year's
Day. She was more biting than the north-east
wind that was curdling the ponds in the Park."

A fig for her bitterness. Do you suppose I
mind ? If you won't take me to her I shall go by
myself. A character of that kind has an irresistible
fascination for me. I would go a hundred miles
any day to see a bitter, bad woman."

She is bitter enough, but she may not be bad.
She may be only a creature who mistakes fanaticism
for religion, who has so misread her Bible that she
thinks it her bounden duty to shut her heart against
a beloved child rather than to forgive a sinner. I
believe she is to be pitied rather than blamed,
odious as she may seem."

Very likely. A hard heart, or an obstinate
temper, is a disease like other diseases. One ought
to be sorry for the sufferer. But this woman has a
strong character, anyhow, for good or evil, and I
delight in studying character. The average man
and woman is so colourless that there is infinite
relief in the study of any temperament which

touches the extreme. Think how delightful it
would be to meet such a man as ago or Othello 
picture to yourself the pleasure of watching the
gradual unfolding of such a mind as lachimo's, and
consider how keen would be one's interest in getting
to the bottom of a woman like that poisoning stepmother
of Imogen's whose name Shakspeare does not
take the trouble to record. So this is the lodge 
charming Early English cottage  real rustic English,
not Bedford Parkish  half-timbered, thatched
gables, dormers like eyes under bushy eyebrows,
walls four feet thick, lattices two hundred years old.
It might be the very cottage in which Grandmamma
Wolf waited for the dear, plump little girl, with
chubby cheeks shining like the butter in her basket,
and with lips as sweet as her honey. Poor little
girl!"

The servant-maid ran down the steps to open the
gate, and as the wheels stopped an upper casement
swung suddenly open, and a woman's face appeared
in the golden light, a pale, wan face, whose most
noticeable expression was a look of infinite weariness


'* Arsenic," said Cuthbert, as they drove in at

the gate. " Decidedly arsenic. I should suspect
that woman "

''Of what?"

Of being a vegetarian," answered Cuthbert
gravely. " But I'll call tomorrow, and find out all
about her."

Lord Cheriton received his kinsman's friend with
marked cordiality, and seemed to enjoy his freshness
and spontaneity. They talked of Cambridge  the
Cambridge of forty years ago and the Cambridge of
to-day  and they talked of the continental schools of
medicine, a subject in which the lawyer was warmly
interested. There were no other visitors expected
before September, when three old friends of Lord
Cheriton's were to shoot the partridges. In October
there was to be a large party for the pheasant shooting,
which was the chief glory of Cheriton Chase.
There had been no shooters at the Chase last year,
and Lord Cheriton felt himself so much the more
constrained to hospitality.

You fellows must come in October, when we
have our big shoot," he said, but Cuthbert Ramsay
told him that he must be at work again in London
before the end of September.

Cuthbert was much impressed by the master of
Cheriton Chase, and the grave and quiet dignity
with which he wore success that might have made a
weaker man arrogant and self-assertive. It would
seem as if scarcely anything were wanting to that
prosperous career. Yet Cuthbert saw that his host
was not free from a cloud of care. It was natural,
perhaps, that he should feel the tragedy of his son-in-law's
death as a lasting trouble, not to be shuffled
off and forgotten when the conventional period of
mourning was past.

Theodore had some private talk with his cousin
on the first evening of his visit, walking up and
down the terrace, while Cuthbert was looking at the
books in the library, under Lady Cheriton's guidance.
He had it fully in his mind that the time
must come when he would be obliged to take Lord
Cheriton into his confidence, but he felt that time
was still far ofl\ Whenever the revelation came it
must needs be infinitely painful to both, and deeply
humiliating to the man whose hidden sin had
brought desolation upon his innocent daughter, and
untimely death upon the man whose fate had been
linked with hers. It was for his dishonour, for the

wrongs inflicted by him, that those two had made
expiation.

No, the time to be outspoken  the time to say in
the words of the prophet  " Thou art the man,"
had not yet come. When it should come he would
be prepared to act resolutely and fearlessly ; but in
the meantime he must needs go on working in the
dark.

He remembered his last conversation with Lord
Cheriton on that subject  remembered how Cheriton
had said that he believed Godfrey Carmichael incapable
of a dishonourable action  incapable of having
behaved cruelly to any woman. Had he who pronounced
that judgment been guilty of dishonour 
had he been cruel to the woman who sacrificed herself
for him ? There are so many degrees in such
wrong-doing ! There is the sin of impulse : there
is the deliberate betrayal, the coldly planned
iniquity, the sin of the practised seducer who has
reduced seduction to a science, and who has no more
heart or conscience than a machine. There is the
sin of the generous man, who finds his feet caught
in the web of circumstance, who begins, innocently
enough, by pitying a neglected wife, and ends by

betraying the neglectful husband. Theodore gave
his kinsman credit for belonging to the category of
generous sinners. Indeed, the fact that he had
lived aloof from the world for many years, sharing
the isolation of the woman who loved him, was in
itself evidence that he had not acted as a villain ;
yet it was possible that when the final hour came,
the hour for breaking those illicit bonds, the rupture
may have been in sometime cruel ; and the remembrance
of that cruelty might be a burden upon the
sinner's conscience at this day. Such partings can
never be without cruelty. The fact that one sinner is
to marry and begin a new life, while the other sinner
is to finish her days in a dishonoured widowhood, is
in itself a cruelty. She may submit, as to a fate
which she foresaw dimly, even in the hour of her
fall  but she would be more than human if she did
not think herself hardly used by the man who forsakes
her. Nothing he can do to secure her worldly
comfort or to screen her from the world's disdain
will take the sting out of that parting. The one
fact remains that her day is done. He has ceased to
care for her, and he has begun to care for another.
*' Nothing has occurred since I was here to throw

any new light upon the murder, I suppose ? "
Theodore said quietly, as they smoked their cigars,
walking slowly up and down in the summer night.

"Nothing."

** Did her ladyship tell you that I have met a
girl in London, whom I believe to be no other than
Mercy Porter ? "

Yes, she told me something about that fancy of
yours, for I take it to be nothing more than a fancy.
The world is too wide for you and Mercy Porter to
meet so easily. What was your ground for identifying
her with the lodge-keeper's girl ? "

"The lodge-keeper's girl ! " There was something
needlessly contemptuous in the phrase, it seemed to
Theodore : a studied disdain.

It was she herself who suggested the idea, by
her inquiries about Cheriton. She confessed to
having come from this part of the world, and she
has an air of refinement which shows that she does
not belong to the peasant class. She is a very good
pianiste  plays with remarkable taste and feeling ;
and Lady Cheriton tells me that Mercy had a talent
for music. I have no doubt in my own mind that
this young woman is Mercy Porter, and I think her

mother ought to go to London and see her, even if
she should not think fit to bring her back to the
home she left."

Mrs. Porter is a woman of peculiar temper.
The girl may be happier away from her."

Yes, that is very likely  but the mother ought
to forgive her. The penitent sinner, whose life for
the last few years has been blameless, ought to feel
that she is pardoned and at peace with her mother.
I tried to approach the subject, but Mrs. Porter repelled
me with an almost vindictive air ; and I do
not think it would be any good for me to plead for
my poor friend again. If you or Lady Cheriton
would talk to her "

I will get my wife to manage her. It is a
matter in which a woman would have more influence
than you or I. In the meantime, if there is anything
I can do to make Mercy Porter's life easier, I
shall be very glad to do it, for her father's sake."

You are very good ; but she is not in want, and
she seems content with her lot."

What is she doing for a living ? "

Her employment is fine needlework. She lives
in one small back room in Lambeth, and has only

one friend in the world, and that friend happens to
be a lady who once lived in this house."

A lady who lived in this house ! " exclaimed
Lord Cheriton. ' Who in Heaven's name do you
mean ? "

Miss Newton, who was governess to Miss
Strangway nearly forty years ago."

What brought Miss Newton and you together
? "

*' That is rather a long story. I took some
trouble to find the lady in order to settle one question
which had disturbed my cousin Juanita since
her husband's death."

"What question?"

She was haunted by an idea that Sir Godfrey's
murderer was one of the Strangways, and his murder
an act of vengeance by some member of that banished
race. It was in order to set this question at rest
for ever that I took some trouble to hunt out the
history of Squire Strangway's two sons and only
daughter. I traced them all three to their graves,
and have been able to convince Juanita that they
and their troubles were at rest long before the time
of her husband's murder."

What could have put such a notion into her
head ? "

Oh, it came naturally enough. It was only a
development of Churton's idea of a vendetta."

She was always full of fancies. Yes, I remember
she used to say the house was haunted by the ghosts
of the Strong ways. I really think she had a dim
idea that I had injured that spendthrift race in buying
the estate which they had wasted. And so to
satisfy Juanita you took the trouble to ferret out
Miss Newton ? Upon my word, Theodore, your
conduct is more Quixotic than I could have believed
of any young man in the nineteenth century. And
pray by what means did you discover the ci-devant
governess?"

Theodore told the story of his visit to the scholastic
agencies, his journey to Westmorland, and his
friendly reception by Miss Newton in her Lambeth
lodgings.

She was much attached to Miss Strangway, who
was her first charge, and near enough to her own
age to be more of a companion than a pupil," he
said, " and she spoke of her melancholy fate with
great tenderness."

VOL. III. E

It was a melancholy fate, was it ? I know she
made a runaway-marriage ; but in what way washer
fate sadder than the common destiny of a spendthrift's
daughter  a girl who has been reared in
extravagance and self-indulgence, and who finds
herself face to face with penury in the bloom of her
womanhood ? "

That in itself would be sad, but Miss Strangely's
destiny was sadder than that  commonplace
enough, no doubt  only the old story of an unhappy
marriage and a runaway wife."

He could not help looking at Lord Cheriton at
this point, thinking how this common story of an
unfaithful wife must needs remind his kinsman of
that other story of another wife which had influenced
his early manhood. He must surely have a sensitive
shrinking from the discussion of any similar story.

She ran away from her husband ! Yes, I
remember having heard as much. What did
Miss Newton know about her  beyond that one
fact?"

Very little  only that she died at Boulogne
nearly twenty years ago. This fact Miss Newton
heard from the lips of the man for whom Mrs.

Darcy left her husband. I had been at Boulogne a
week or so before I saw Miss Newton, and I had
hunted there for any record of Mrs. Darcy' s death,
without result. But this is not very strange, as it
is quite likely that she lived at Boulogne under an
assumed name, and was buried in that name, and
so lies there, in a foreign land, dissevered forever
from any association with her name and
kindred."

There are not many of her kindred left, I take
it," said Lord Cheriton. " There seems to have
been a blight upon that race for the last half-century.
But, now, tell me about someone in whom I am
more interested  the girl you believe to belMercy
Porter. I should be very glad to make her life
happier, and so I told her ladyship. You, Theodore,
might be the intermediary. I would allow her a
hundred a year, which would enable her to live in
some pretty country place  in Devonshire or Cornwall,
for instance, in some quiet sea-coast village
where no one would know anything about her or her
story."

*' A hundred a year ! My dear Cheriton, that is
a most generous offer."

E 2

No, no, there is no question of generosity. Her
father was my friend, and I was under some obligation
to him. And then the girl was my wife's protegee ;
and, finally, I can very well afford it. I am almost
a childless man, Theodore. My grandson will be
rich enough when I am gone, rich enough to
be sure of a peerage, I hope, so that there
may be a Baron Cheriton when I am in the
dust."

' You are very good. I believe this girl has a
great deal of pride  the pride of a woman who has
drunk the cup of shame, and she may set herself
against being your pensioner ; but if the matter can
be arranged as you wish she may yet see happier
days. I think the first thing to be done is to reconcile
mother and daughter. Mrs. Porter ought to go upto
London "

To see Miss Newton's iwotegee ? On no account.
I tell you Mrs. Porter is a woman of strange
temper  God knows how bitterly she might
upbraid her daughter. And if the girl is proud,
as you say she is, the mother's reproaches would
goad her to refuse any help from me or my wife.
No Theodore, the longer we keep mother and

daughter apart, the better for Mercy's chances of
happiness."

But if this young woman should refuse to confess
her identity with Mercy Porter it will be impossible
to benefit her."

'* That difficulty may be easily overcome. You
can take my wife to see her. She was always fond
of my wife."

And you will leave the mother out of the question.
That seems rather hard upon her''

I tell you, Theodore it, is better to leave the
mother out of the question. She never acted a
mother's part to Mercy  there was never any real
motherly love  at least that was Lady Cheriton's
opinion of the woman, and she had ample opportunity
for judging, which, of course, I had not. If you
want to help the daughter, keep the mother aloof
from her."

I daresay you are right, and I shall of course
obey you implicitly," said Theodore, inwardly reluctant.


He had an exalted idea of maternal love, its
obligations and privileges, and it seemed to him
a hard thing to come between a penitent daughter

and a mother whose heart ought to be full
of pity and pardon. Yet he remembered his
brief interview with Mrs. Porter, and he could
but own to himself that this might be an exceptional
case.

UBRi;"!,  .iUfKJBf

And from that time to this I am alone,
And I shall be alone until I die."

Theodore and his friend strolled across the Park
on Saturday afternoon in the direction of the west
gate, Cuthbert Ramsay intent upon carrying out his
intention of introducing himself to Mrs. Porter,
and Theodore submitting meekly to be led as it were
into the lion's den.

"You have no idea what hard stuff this woman
is made of," he said ; and then he told Ramsay what
Lord Cheriton had said to him about Mrs. Porter on
the previous evening, and how the daughter's life
was to be made happy, if possible, without reference
to the mother.

The harder she is the more I am interested in
making her acquaintance," replied Cuthbert. " I
don't care a jot about commonplace women, were
they as lovely as Aphrodite. I go to see this soured

widow as eagerly as Romeo scaled Juliet's balcony.
Did his lordship ever tell you what it was that
soured the creature, by the way ? That kind of
hardness is generally in sometime the result of circumstance,
even where there is the adamantine
quality in the original character."

I never heard any details about the lady's past
life ; only that her husband was in the merchant
navy, upon the India and China line  that he died
suddenly and left her penniless  that she was a lady
by birth and education, and had married somewhat
beneath her. I have often wondered how my cousin,
as a barrister, came to be intimate with a captain in
the merchant service."

They were at the gates of the Park by this time,
and close to the rustic steps which led up to Mrs.
Porter's garden. It was one of those tropical days
which often occur towards tho end of August, and
the clusters of cactus, dahlias in the old-fashioned
border and the tall hollyhocks in the background, made
patches of dazzling colour in the bright white light,
against which the cool grays of the stone cottage
offered repose to the eye. One side of the cottage
was starred with passion-flowers, and on the other

the great waxen chalices of the magnolia showed
creamy white against the scarlet of the trumpet ash.
It was the season at which Mrs. Porter's hermitage
put on its gayest aspect, the crowning feast of bloom
and colour before the chilling breath of autumn
brought rusty reds and pallid grays into the picture.

The two young men heard voices as they
approached the steps, and on looking upward, Theodore
saw the curate and his wife standing on the
little grass-plot with Mrs. Porter. There could
hardly be a better opportunity for approaching her,
as she was caught in the act of receiving visitors, and
could not deny herself.

Mr. and Mrs. Kempster were young people, and
of that social temperament which will make friends
under the hardest conditions. Mr. Kempster belonged
to the advanced Anglican school, and
ministered the offices of the Church as it were with
his life in his hand, always prepared for the moment
when he should come into collision with his Bishop
upon some question of posture or vestments. He had
introduced startling innovations into the village
church, anchored to be able to paraphrase the boasts
Augustus, and to say that he found Cheriton Evangelical

and left it Kitualistic. Needless to say, that
while he gratified one-half of his congregation he
offended the other half, and that old-fashioned
parishioners complained bitterly of his '' gewgaws
fetched from Aaron's old wardrobe or the flamen's
vestry." Mrs. Kempster had work enough to do
in smoothing down the roughened furs of these
antediluvians, which smoothing process she effected
chiefly by a rigorous system of polite afternoon calls,
in which no inhabitant of the parish was forgotten,
and an occasional small expenditure in the shape
of afternoon tea and halfpenny buns toasted and
buttered by her own fair hands. She was a bright,
good-tempered little woman, whom her husband
generally spoke of as a "body."

The Dempster had just accepted Mrs. Porter's
invitation to tea, and were making an admiring
inspection of her garden before going into the
cottage.

"I don't believe any one in Cheriton parish has
such roses as you, Mrs. Porter," said the curate's
wife, gazing admiringly at the standard gloire de
Dijon, which had grown into gigantic dimensions
in the middle of the grass-plot. " I never saw

such a tree; but then, you see, you give your mind
to your garden as none of us can."

I have very little else to think about, certainly,"
said Mrs. Porter.

"Except Algerian's sermons. I know you
appreciate them," cried Mrs. Kempster, in her
chirruping little voice. *' Algerian says no one
listens as attentively as you do. ' She quite carries
me away sometimes with that rapt look of hers,' he
said the other day. I am half inclined to feel
jealous of you, Mrs. Porter. Oh, here is Mr. Dal-brook.
How d'ye do, Mr. Dalbrook? "

Mrs. Kempster shook hands with Theodore
before he could approach Mrs. Porter, but having
got past this vivacious lady, he introduced Cuthbert
Ramsay to the mistress of the house.

My friend is a stranger in the neighbourhood,
sirs. Porter," he said, " and he was so struck by
the beauty of your cottage yesterday that he set his
heart upon being introduced to you, and I was really
obliged to bring him."

*' My cottage is not generally considered a show
place, Mr. Dalbrook," she answered, coldly, turning
her dull gray eyes full upon Theodore with a look

which made him uncomfortable, " but I shall be
very happy to show it to your friend  and his lordship's
friend, I conclude."

I don't know if I dare claim that distinction,
Mrs. Porter," answered Cuthbert, in his cheerful
resonant voice. " This is my first visit to the
Chase ; and if Lord Cheriton has received me with
open arms it is only because I am his kinsman's
friend."

Theodore introduced the stranger to the Kemp-steps,
who welcomed him eagerly, as one who came
fraught with the interests and excitements of the
outer world.

'may I ask if our man has got in for Southwark
? " demanded Mr. Kempster. " His lordship
would be sure to get a telegram after the polling."

I blush to say that I forgot all about the election,
and didn't ask after the telegram," replied
Cuthbert. "When you say * our man,' you
mean "

The Conservative candidate. I conclude you
belong to us."

Again I blush to say I don't belong to you the
least little bit. I am an advanced Liberal."

Mr. Kempster sighed, with a sigh that was almost
a groan.

"A destroyer and reestablished of everything
that has made the glory of England since the days
of the Heptarchy," he said, plaintively.

Well, yes, there have been a good many false
gods toppled over, and a good many groves of Baal
cut down, since the Saxon Kings ruled over the
Seven Kingdoms. You don't want Baal and the
rest of them stuck up again, do you, Mr. Kempster
? "

Mr. Ramsay, there are times and seasons when
I would to God I could wake up in the morning
and find myself a subject of King Egbert. Yes,
when I see the rising tide of anarchy  the advancing
legions of unbelief  the Upas Tree of sensual
science," said Kempster, slipping airily from metaphor
to metaphor, " I would gladly lay hold upon all
that was most rigid and uncompromising among the
bulwarks of the past. I would belong to the Church
of Wolsey and Becket. I would lie prostrate
before the altar at which St. Augustine was celebrant.
I would grovel at the feet of Dunstan."

Ah, Mr* Kempster, we can't go back. That's

the plague of it, for romantic minds like yours. I
am afraid we have done with the picturesque in
religion and in everything else. We are children of
light  of the fierce white light of science and
common sense. We may regret the scenic darkness
of medisevalism, but we cannot go back to it. The
clouds of ignorance and superstition have rolled
away, and we stand out in the open, in the searching
light of truth. We know what we are, and
whom we serve."

At Mrs. Porter's invitation they all followed her
into the cottage parlour, where the tea-table stood
ready, and much more elegantly appointed than that
modest board which the curate's wife was wont to
spread for her friends. Here there appeared both
old china and old silver, and the tea which Mrs.
Porter's slender white hands dispensed was of as
delicate an aroma as that choice Indian pekoe which
Theodore occasionally enjoyed in Lady Cheriton's
boudoir.

Mrs. Porter placed herself with her back to the
window, but Cuthbert's keen eyes were able to note
every change in her countenance as she listened to
the conversation going on round her, or on rare

occasions took part in it. He observed that she
was curiously silent, and he was of opinion that
Theodore's presence was in some manner painful
to her. She addressed him now and then, but with
an effort which was evident to those studious eyes
of Cuthbert Kamsay's, though it might escape any
less keen observer.

The conversation was of politics and of the outer
world for the first ten minutes, and was obviously
uninteresting to Mrs. Kempster, who fidgeted with
her teaspoon, made several attempts to speak, and
had to wait her opportunity, but finally succeeded in
engaging Theodore's attention.

Have you seen Lady Carmichael lately, Mr.
Dalbrook? " she inquired.

I saw her three days ago."

*' And how did you find her ? In better spirits I
hope? She hardly ever comes to Cheriton now,
and her old friends know very little about her.
I am told she has a horror of the place, though
she was once so fond of it. Poor thing, it is only
natural ! You found an improvement in her I
hope?"

Yes, I saw at least the beginning of improve-merit,"

answered Theodore. " Her child gives a
new interest to her life''

** What a blessing that is ! And by-and-by she
will meet some one else who will interest her even
more than her baby, and she will marry again. She
is too young to go on grieving for ever. Don't you
think so, Mrs. Porter ? "

*eyes, I suppose she will forget sooner or later.
Most women have a faculty for forgetting."

'* Most women, but not all women," said Cuthbert,
with his earnest air, which made the commonest
words mean more from him than from other
men. *' I do not think you would be the kind of
woman to forget very quickly, Mrs. Porter."

She was in no hurry to notice this remark, but
went on pouring out tea quietly for a minute or two
before she replied.

There is not much room in my life for forgetfulness,"
she said, after that protracted pause. " So
without being in any way an exceptional person, I
may lay claim to a good memory."

*she remembers her daughter, and yet memory
does not soften her heart," thought Theodore.
'' With her memory means implacability."

He looked round the room, in the flickering light
of the sunshine that crept in between the bars of the
Venetian shutters. He had not expected ever to be
sitting at his ease in Mrs. Porter's parlour after that
unpromising conversation upon the first day of the
year. He looked round the room, thoughtfully contemplative
of every detail in its arrangement which
served to tell him what manner of woman Mrs.
Porter was. He was not a close student of character
like Ramsay ; he had made for himself no scientific
code of human expression in eye and lip and head
and hand ; but it seemed to him always that the
room in which a man or a woman lived gave a useful
indication of that man's or that woman's mental
qualities.

This room testified that its mistress was a lady.
The furniture was heterogeneous  shabby for the
most part, from an upholsterer's point of view, old-fashioned
without being antique ; but there was
nevertheless a cachet upon every object which told
that it had been chosen by a person of taste, from
the tall Chippendale bureau which filled one corner
of the room, to the solid carved oak table which
held the tea tray. The ornaments were few,

VOL. III. *

but they were old china, and china of some mark
from the collector's point of view ; the draperies
were of Madras muslin, spotless, and fresh as a
spring morning. Theodore noticed, however, that
there were no flowers in the vases, and none of
those scattered trifles which usually mark the
presence of refined womanhood. The room would
have had a hare and chilly aspect, lacking these
things, if it had not been for a few pictures, and
for the bookshelves, which were filled with handsomely
bound books.

*' You have a nice library, Mrs. Porter," he said,
somewhat aimlessly, as he took a cup of tea from
her hands. " I suppose you are a great reader ? "

'* Yes, I read a great deal. I have my books and
my garden. Those make up my sum of life."

*' May I look at your books ? "

"If you like," she answered coldly.

He went about the small, low room  so low, with
its heavily-timbered ceiling, that Cuthbert Ramsay's
head almost touched the crossness and surveyed
the collections of books in their different blocks.
Whoever had so arranged them had exercised both
taste and dexterity. Everything in the room fitted

like a Chinese puzzle, and everything seemed to
have been adapted to those few pieces of old furniture
 the walnut wood bureau, the oak table, and
the old Italian chairs. The books were theological
or metaphysical for the most part, but among them
he found Carlyle's 'sarto Eesartus," "Past and
Present," and "French Revolution;" Buller's
mystical stories, and a few books upon magic,
ancient and modern.

I see you have a fancy for the black art, Mrs.
Porter," he said lightly. " One would hardly expect
to find such books as these in the Isle of Purbeck."


** I like to know what men and women have built
their hopes upon in the ages that are gone," she
answered. " Those dreams may seem foolishness
to us now, but they were very real to the dreamers,
and there were some who dreamed on till the final
slumber  the one dreamless sleep."

This was the longest speech she had made since
the young men entered her garden, and both were
struck by this sudden gleam of animation. Even
the large grey eyes brightened for a few moments,
but only to fade again to that same dull, unflinching

F 2

gaze which made them more difficult to meet than
any other eyes Theodore Dalbrook had ever looked
upon. That unflinching stare froze his blood ; he
felt a restraint and an embarrassment which no
other woman had ever caused him.

It was different with Cuthbert Ramsay. He was
as much at his ease in Mrs. Porter's parlour as if he
had known that lady all her life. He looked at her
books without asking permission. He moved about
with a wonderful airiness of movement which never
brought him into anybody's way. He fascinated
Mrs. Kempster, and subjugated her husband, and
impressed everybody by that strong individuality
which raises some men a head and shoulders above
the common herd. It would have been the same
had there been a hundred people in the room instead
of five.

Mrs. Porter relapsed into silence, and the conversation
was carried on chiefly by Cuthbert Ramsay
and the Curate, until Mrs. Kempster declared that
she must be going, lest the children should be unhappy
at her absence from their evening meal.

I make a point of seeing them at their tea,"
she said ; *' and then they say their prayers to me

before nurse puts them to bed  so prettily, and
Laura sings a hymn with such a sweet little voice.
I am sure she will be musical by-and-by, if it is
only by the way she stands beside the piano and
listens while I sing. And such an ear as that child
has, as fine as a bird's. You must come and hear
her sing * Abide with me,' some day, Mrs. Porter,
when you drop in to take a cup of tea."

Mrs. Porter murmured something to the effect
that she would be pleased to enjoy that privilege.

'' Ah, but you never come to tea with me, though
I am always asking you. I'm afraid you are not
very fond of children."

I am not used to them, and I don't think that
children like people who are out of the habit of
associating with them," answered Mrs. Porter
deliberately. *' I never know what to say to a child.
My life has been too grave and too solitary for me
to be fit company for children."

The Curate and his wife took leave and went
briskly down the steps to the lane, and Theodore
made a little movement towards departure, but
Cuthbert Ramsay lingered, as if he were really loth
to go.

"I am absolutely in love with your cottage, Mrs.
Porter," lie said ; ** it is an ideal abode, and I can
fancy a lady of your studious habits being perfectly
happy in this tranquil spot."

The life suits me well enough," she answered,
icily, " perhaps better than any other."

You have a piano yonder, I see," he said, glancing
through the half open door to an inner room
with a latticed window, beyond which a sunlit garden
on a bit of shelving ground sloped upwards to the
edge of the low hill-side, the garden vanishing into
an upland meadow, where cows were seen grazing
against the evening light. This second sitting-room
was more humbly furnished than the parlour in
which they had been taking tea, and its chief feature
was a cottage piano, which stood diagonally between
the lattice and the small fireplace.

'you too are musical, I conclude," pursued
Cuthbert, " like little Miss Kempster."

*' I am very fond of music."

** Might we be favoured by hearing you play
something ? "

I never play before people. I played tolerably
once, perhaps  at least my master was good enough

to say so. But I play now only snatches of music,
by fits and starts, as the humour seizes me."

She seated herself by the casement with a resigned
air, as much as to say, *rare these young men
never going ? " Her long, thin fingers busied
themselves in plucking the faded leaves from the
pelargoniums which made a bank of colour on the
broad window ledge.

*' You were at home at the time of the murder, I
suppose, Mrs. Porter?" said Cuthbert, after a
pause, during which he had occupied himself in
looking at the water-colour sketches on the walls,
insignificant enough, but good of their kind, and
arguing a cultivated taste in the person who collected
them.

I am never away from home."

"And you heard and saw nothing out of the
common course  you have no suspicion of any one ?"

Do you suppose if I had it would not have been
made Mown to the police immediately after the
murder ? Do you think I should hoard and treasure
up a suspicion, or a scrap of circumstantial evidence
till you came to ask me for it ? " she said, with
suppressed irritation.

"Pray forgive me. I had no idea of offending
you by my question. It is natural that any one
coming to Cheriton Chase for the first time
should feel a morbid interest in that mysterious
murder'*

If you had heard it talked about as much as I
have you would be as weary of the subject as I am'*
said Mrs. Porter, rather more courteously. "I
have discussed it with the local police and the
London police, with his Lordship, with the doctor,
with Mr. Dalbrook's father, with Lady Carmichael,
with Lady Jane Carmichael, these having all a right
to question me  and with a good many other
people in the neighbourhood who had no right to
question me. I answer you as I answered them.
No, I saw nothing, I heard nothing on that fatal
night  nor in the week before that fatal night, nor
at any period of Lady Carmichael' s honeymoon.
Whoever the murderer was he did not come in a
carriage and summon my servant to unlock the
gate for him. The footpath through the Park is
open all night. There was nothing to hinder a
stranger coming in and going out  and the chances
were a thousand to one, I fancy, against his being

observed  once clear of the house. That is all I
know about it."

"And as an old resident upon the property you
have no knowledge of any one who had a grudge
against Lord Cheriton or his daughter  such a feeling
as might prompt the murder of the lady's husband
as a mode of retaliation upon the lady or her
father?"

I know no such person, and I have never considered
the crime from such a point of view. It is
too far-fetched a notion."

Perhaps. Yet where a crime is apparently
motiveless the mainspring must be looked for below
the surface. Only a far-fetched theory can serve in
such a case."

Shall I tell you what I think about the murder,
Mr. Ramsay?" asked Mrs. Porter, looking up at
him suddenly, and fixing him with those steady
grey eyes,

Pray do."

*' I think that no one upon God's earth will ever
know who fired that shot. Only at the Day of
Judgment will the murderer stand revealed, and
then the secret of the crime and the motive will

stand forth written in fire upon the scroll that records
men's wrongs and sorrows and sins. You and I,
and all of us, may read the story there, perhaps, in
that day when we shall stand as shadows before the
great white throne."

I believe you are right, Mrs. Porter," answered
Cuthbert quietly, holding out his hand to take leave.
' A secret that has been kept for more than a
year is likely to be kept till we are all in our graves.
The murderer himself will be the one to tell it,
perhaps. There are men who are proud of a bloody
revenge, as if it were a noble deed. Good day to
you, Mrs. Porter, and many thanks for your
friendly reception."

He held the thin, cold hand in his own ashe
said this, looking earnestly at the imperturbable
face, and then he and Theodore left the
cottage.

Well, Cuthbert, what do you think of that
woman?" asked Theodore, after they had passed
through the gate, and into the quiet of the long
glade where the fallow deer were browsing in the
fading day.

I think a 'good deal about her, but I haven't

thought out my opinion yet. Has she ever been
off her head ? "

Not to my knowledge. She has lived in that
house for twenty years. I never heard that there
was anything wrong with her mentally."

*' I believe there is something, or has been something
very wrong. There is madness in that
woman's eye. It may be the indication of past
trouble, or it may be a warning of an approaching
disturbance. She is a woman who has suffered
intensely, and who has acquired an abnormal power
of self-restraint. I should like to know her history."


*'My God, Cuthbert," cried Theodore, grasping
him by the arm, and coming suddenly to a standstill,
"do you know what your words suggest  to what
your conclusion points ? The murder of my
cousin's husband was an act of vengeance, or of
lunacy. eve have made up our minds about that,
have we not? The detective, Juanita, you and I,
everybody. "wye are looking for some wretch capable
of a blindly malignant revenge, or for homicidal
madness, with its unreasoning thirst for blood ; and
here, here at these gates is a woman whom you

suspect of madness, a woman who could have had
access to the gardens at any hour, who knew the
habits and hours of the servants, who would know
how to elude observation."

*' My dear fellow, you are going a great deal too
far. Who said I suspected that unhappy woman of
homicidal madness ? The brain disease I suspect
in Mrs. Porter is melancholia, the result of long
years of self-restraint and solitude, the not unfrequent
consequence of continuous brooding upon a
secret grief."

My eyes are dim with childish tears,
My heart is idly stirred,
For the same sound is in my ears
'Which in those days I heard."

That suggestion of Cuthbert Ramsay's of latent
madness in the lodge-keeper came upon Theodore
like a flash of lurid light, and gave a new colour to
all his thoughts. It was in vain that his friend
reminded him of the wide distinction between the
fury of the homicidal lunatic and the settled melancholy
of a mind warped by misfortune. After that
conversation in the park he was haunted by Mrs.
Porter's image, and he found his mind distracted
between two opposite ideas ; one pointing to the
man who had claimed Mrs. Danvers as his wife, the
deserted and betrayed husband of James Dalbrook's
mistress ; the other dwelling upon the image of this
woman living at his kinsman's gate, with an existence
which was unsatisfactorily explained by the scanty

facts which he had been able to gather about her
former history.

He recalled her conduct about her daughter, her
cold and almost vindictive rejection of the penitent
sinner ; her stern resolve to stand alone in the
world.

Was that madness, or the consciousness of guilt,
or what ? It was conduct too unnatural to be accounted
for easily, consider it how he might. He
had heard often enough of fathers refusing to be
reconciled with erring or disobedient children. The
flinty hardness of the father's heart has become
proverbial. But an unforgiving mother seems an
anomaly in nature.

He determined upon confiding Ramsay's opinion
and his own doubts to Lord Cheriton without delay.

Whatever abnormal circumstances there had been
in Mrs. Porter's history, her benefactor was likely
to be acquainted with them ; and if those circumstances
had affected her intellect it was vital that he
should be made aware of the fact before evil of any
kind could arise.

He contrived an after dinner stroll upon the
terrace with his kinsman as upon the previous evening,

and entered upon the subject without loss of
time.

Ramsay and I took our afternoon tea with Mrs.
Porter," he said.

Indeed ! How did that come about ? She is
not a sociable person in a general way, or accessible
to strangers."

*' It was to gratify a fancy of Ramsay's that I
went there. He admired her cottage and was
interested in her history, and took it into his head
that she was a woman of exceptional character."

*' He was not far wrong there, I believe. Mrs.
Porter is a very hard nut to crack. I have never
been able to fathom her."

*rand yet with your knowledge of her previous
history you must have the safest clue to her
character."

I don't know about that. There is nothing exceptional
in her history  and there is much that is
exceptional in her character, as your friend says.
Pray what was the result of his observation of the
lady in the leisure of afternoon tea-drinking? "

He believed that he saw the traces of madness
in her countenance and manner ; madness either

past, present, or impending. He could not decide
which."

There was not light enough upon the terrace to
show Theodore any change in his cousin's countenance,
but the movement of Lord Cheriton's hand ashe
took the cigar from his mouth, and the sudden
slackening of his pace were sufficient indications of
troubled thought. It could hardly be pleasant for
him to hear so melancholy a suggestion about the
pensioner whom he had established in comfort at his
gate, intending that she should enjoy his bounty for
all the days of her life.

*' Upon what does your friend base this fantastical
notion ? " he asked angrily.

*' Upon physiological and psychological evidence.
You can question him, if you like. It appears tome
that you ought to know the truth."

I have no objection to hear anything he may
have to say, but it is very unlikely I shall be influenced
by him. These young men, who are byway
of being savants, are full of crochets and
theories. They look at every one as Darwin looked
at a Virginia creeper or a cowslip, with a preconceived
notion that they must find out something

about him. I believe Mrs. Porter, with her calm,
impassible nature, is much better able to reckon up
your friend Kamsay than he is able to come to a
correct opinion about her."

I should like you to discuss the question with
him, at any rate," said Theodore. " The horror of
last year's calamity is a reason you should have
nobody about the estate whom you cannot trust."

What do you mean ? "

I mean that while you have madness at your
gate you may have murder in your house."

Theodore ! You cannot be so cruel as to
associate that unhappy woman with Godfrey Carmichael's
death? "

** God knows ! That murder has to be accounted
for somehow. Can you, as Juanita's father, know
rest or peace till it has been accounted for ? I could
not, in your place."

** I hope you do not think it necessary toothache
my duty to my daughter," said Lord Cheriton
coldly ; and Theodore felt that he had said too
much.

His cousin addressed him upon some indifferent
subject a minute or so afterwards, when he had

VOL. III. G

lighted a fresh cigar, and his manner resumed its
usual friendliness. There was no further mention
of Mrs. Porter that night, hut on Sunday Lord
Cheriton walked home from church with Cuthbert
Ramsay, and questioned him as to his impressions
about the lodge-keeper.

*' Theodore has exaggerated the significance of my
remark," explained Cuthbert. "I take it Mrs.
Porter's case is one of slight aberration brought on
by much brooding upon troubles, real or imaginary.
If my power to diagnose is worth anything, her
mind has lost its balance, her thoughts have lost
their adjusting power. She is like a piece of
mechanism that has got out of square, and will only
work one way. You may hardly consider that this
amounts to madness, and I may have done wrong in
speaking of it : only were Mrs. Porter concerned in
my existence, I should feel it incumbent on me to
watch her ; and I recommend you to have her
watched, so far as it can be done without alarming
or annoying her."

I will do what I can. I will get another
opinion from a man of long experience in mental
cases. I have an old friend in the medical profession,

a specialist, who has made mental disease the
study of his life. He will give me any advice I
want."

You cannot do better than get his opinion of
Mrs. Porter, if you are interested in her welfare."

**I am interested in all who are dependent upon
me, and in her especially, on account of old
associations."

Lady Carmichael drove over to Cheriton after
luncheon, upon one of those Sunday visits which she
paid from time to time in deference to her father,
albeit she could never approach the house without
pain. She came in the useful family landau, which
had carried the Misses Carmichael to tennis parties,
dinners, and dances, before they married, and which
now conveyed the nurse and baby on their visits to
Cheriton. She came for what Lady Cheriton called
a long afternoon, and she was received in the library,
which was now the most used room in the house.
iso one cared to occupy that fatal drawing-room ;
and although it was always accessible, and there
was a feint of daily occupation, its cold elegance
was for the most part untenanted.

G 2

And over all there hung a cloud of fear."

To-day, for the first time, Theodore discovered
numerous alterations in the arrangement of pictures
and furniture in the hall. He had promised Cuthbert
to show him the portraits of the Strangways,
and most particularly that picture of the Squire's
three children, painted nearly forty years before ;
but he found that this picture, among others, had
been removed, and that a fine Rhodian plate
occupied its place on the dark oak panelling.

He noticed the fact to his cousin.

I am sorry to miss the family group," he said.
** It was a really interesting picture."

Interesting to you perhaps, who knew the history
of the race," answered Lord Cheriton, *' but
very uninteresting to a stranger. I think I've made
an improvement over there. That plate is a splendid
bit of colour, and lights up a dark corner. Bat that
was not my motive. I wanted to make such trifling
alterations as would change the aspect of the hall
for Juanita, without any ostensible refurnishing. I
have done the same thing in the library. The
changes there are slight, but the room is not as ifc
was when she and her husband occupied it.

*' I should like to show Earn say the Strangway
portraits, if they are get-at-ahle."

They are not just at present. The canvases
were rotting, and I have sent them to London to be
lined. You can show them to sour friend by-and-by,
when I get them back."

Mr. Ramsay's thoughts seemed a long way from
the Strangway portraits this afternoon, although he
had expressed a curiosity as to the lineaments of
that luckless race. He was out in the garden  in
Lady Cheriton's rose garden  with Juanita and her
son, and was giving further proofs of his adaptability
to infantile society. The grandmother was of
the party, looking on with profound admiration at
that phase of awakening intellect which is described
as " taking notice." It was held now as an established
fact that the infant Godfrey James Dalbrook
took notice, and that his notice dwelt with especial
favour upon Cuthbert Ramsay.

I think it must be because you are so tall and
big," said Juanita lightly. " He feels your power,
and he wants to conciliate you."

Artful little beggar ! No, that is much too low
a view. There is a magnetic affinity between us 

love at first sight. When habits do take a fancy
they are thoroughly in earnest about it. Loafing
about in the New Cut sometimes, studying human
nature from the Saturday night point of view, I
have had a poor woman's baby take a fancy to me  a
poor little elfin creature, a year old perhaps, and
not half so big as this bloated aristocrat, a sour-smelling
baby which would give you mal au coeur,
Lady Carmichael ; and the wretched little waif
would hook on to my elephantine finger and cleave
to me as if I were its mother. Oh, how sorry I
have felt for such a baby  with the pure starry eyes
of infancy shining in the flabby withered face that
has grown old for want of cold water and fresh air !
For such infancy and for stray dogs I have suffered
acutest agonies of pity  and yet I have done
nothing  only pitied and passed on. That is the
worst of us. We can all pity, but we don't act
upon the divine impulse. You may be sure the
Levite felt very sorry for the wounded traveller,
though he did not see his way to helping him."

This was one of Cuthbert's tirades, which he was
wont to indulge in when he found himself in congenial
society ; and Juanita's society was particularly

congenial to him. He felt as if no other
woman had ever sympathised with him or understood
him  and he gave her credit for doing loth.
Never had he felt so happy in the society of any
woman, as he felt in this sunlit garden to-day,
among the roses which were just now blooming in a
riotous luxuriance, the branching heads of standards
top-heavy with great balls of blossom, swaying
gently in the summer wind.

He had expected to see her a gloomy creature,
self-conscious in her grief  but the child's little
fingers had loosened her heart strings. If she was
not gay, she was at least able to endure gaiety in
others. She listened to the young man's rhapsodies
and paradoxes with a gentle smile ; she admired
her mother's roses. She cast no shadow upon the
quiet happiness of the summer afternoon, that tranquil
contentedness which belongs to the loveliness
of Nature, and which makes a blessed pause in the
story of human passion and human discontent. It
was one of those summer afternoons which make
one say to oneself, " Could life be always thus what
a blessed thing it were to live ! " and then the
sound of evening bells breaks the spell, and the

shadows creep across the woods, and it is dinner
time, and all that halcyon peace is over.

How lovely she looked in her simply-made black
gown, with its closely-fitting bodice and straight
flowing skirt, of that thick lustreless silk which falls
in such statuesque folds ! The plain little white
crape cap seemed in perfect harmony with that
raven hair and pure white forehead. She was
unlike any other woman Cuthbert Ramsay had ever
known. There was not one touch of society slang,
nor of the society manner of looking at life. She
had passed through the fiery ordeal of two London
seasons scorched in the furnace. Love had been
the purifying influence. She had never lived upon
the excitement of every-day pleasures and volatile
loves, the intermittent fever of flirtations and engagements
that are on and ofi" half a dozen times ina
season. The influence that guided all her
thoughts and all her actions had been one steadfast
and single-minded love. She had cared for no
praises but from her lover's lips ; she had dressed
and danced, and played and sung, for none other
than he. And now in her devotion to her child
there was the same concentration and simplicity.

She did not know that she was looking her loveliest
in that severe hack gown and white cap ; she did
not know that Cuthbert Ramsay admired her far
too much for his peace. She only felt that he was
very sincere in his devotion to the baby, and that he
was a clever young man whose society suggested
new ideas, and made her for the moment forgetful
of her grief.

It was evening before she left Cheriton. She had
stared later than usual, and the shadows were creeping
over the park as she walked to the west gate
with Theodore and his friend, the carriage following
slowly with nurse and baby ensconced among light
fleecy wraps, lest vesper breezes should visit that
human blossom too roughly. Theodore had proposed
the walk across the park, and Juanita had
assented immediately.

"I am always glad of a walk," she said. *' I
have so few excuses for a ramble nowadays. I have
to stay at home to take care of baby."

Do you doubt the capabilities of that
highly-experienced nurse?" asked Ramsay laughingly.


** I doubt every one but myself, and I sometimes

doubt even my own discretion where my precious
one is concerned."

You will have more reason to doubt by-and-by
when your precious one is old enough to be spoilt'*
said Theodore. " He has begun to take notice, and
before very long he will notice that he is monarch of
all he surveys, and that everybody about him is
more or less his slave. He will live in that atmosphere
till you send him to Eton, and then he will
find himself suddenly confronted with the hard,
cruel world of strictly Republican boyhood, which
will jostle and hustle him with ruthless equality."

Lady Cheriton had business in London early in
the following week. She was going to London to
see her dentist, and her dressmaker, the latter being
one of the arbiters of fashion who never go out of
their way to wait upon their clients, but who do the
rather exact reverence and attention from those
clients. She had shopping to do at the West-end
of London, that shopping which is so delightful to
a lady who spends two-thirds of the year in the
country. Above all, she had things to get at the
** Stores," an institution which was dear to Lady

Cheriton*s heart, in spite of all her husband's lectures
upon political economy and the necessity of
sustaining private enterprise and the shopkeeping
interest.

Hearing of these engagements, and that Lady
Cheriton intended to spend two nights in Victoria
Street, Theodore suggested that he should be
allowed to accompany her ladyship to London
and to arrange a meeting between her and the
young woman who called herself Marian Gray.

"If you really wish to help her," he concluded.


**I do really wish it," answered Lord Cheriton
earnestly, *' and the sooner the matter is put in
hand the better pleased I shall be. Shall my wife
call on this person ? '*

She is very proud and very reserved. It might be
better to bring about a meeting which would appear
accidental. Marian goes for a walk with Miss Newton
once or twice a week. I could arrange with her
good friend that they should be walking in a particular
place  Battersea Park for instance  at a
certain hour, and Lady Cheriton could drive that
way with me, and we could meet them. It would

be the easiest way of arriving at the truth as to
Marian Gray's identity with Mercy Porter."

*every good. You might suggest that to my
wife."

Lady Cheriton, who was the soul of good-nature,
fell in at once with Theodore's idea.

I would do anything in my power to help that
poor girl," she said ; "for I think her sadly to he
pitied. Her girlhood was so dull and joyless  such
a ceaseless round of lessons and practice, without
anyof those pleasures to which most school-girls
look forward. Her mother seemed to take a pride
in keeping the girl apart from every one, in dressing
her plainly, and in making her whole life as dreary
as she could. I hardly wonder that the poor, hopeless
creature surrendered to the first tempter  a man
whose manner to women had always been called
irresistible, even by women of the world, and a man
who would not shrink from any amount of falsehood
in pursuing his wicked aim. And now she is paying
forfeit for her sin with a lonely life of toil in a
London garret. Poor Mercy ! She was so pretty
and so refined  a lady in all her instincts."

Cuthbert Ramsay left on Monday, promising to

return at the end of the Tveek ; and Theodore went
up to town with Lady Cheriton on the following
Wednesday. He went straight from the terminus
to Wedgewood Street, where he saw Miss Newton,
told her of Lord Cheriton' s benevolent intentions to
Marian, alias Mercy, and arranged the walk in
Battersea Park for the following afternoon. Miss
Newton and her ijrotegee were to be walking upon
the pathway beside the river at half-past three
o'clock, when Lady Cheriton would drive that way.
Miss Newton had no difficulty in carrying out
her part of the little plot. Marian was always
ready to put aside her work for the pleasure of an
afternoon with that one friend to whom her heart
was ever open. She met Miss Newton at the 
of the tram-car, and they rode through the
dusty crowded highways to the People's Park, where
the flower-beds were gaudy with the rank luxuriance
that is the beginning of the end of summer's good
things, and where the geranium leaves were riddled
by voracious slugs. There was a dustiness and
worn-out air upon all the foliage and all the flowers,
despite the coolness that came from the swiftly-flowing
river  an air of fading and decay which pervades

even the outermost regions of London when
the season is over and the world of fashion has fled
the air of a theatre when the play is done and the
lights are extinguished.

Sarah Newton and her young friend walked slowly
along the gravel pathway, looking dreamily at the
bright river, with its gay movement of passing boats
and flowing waters. The elder of the two friends,
who was wont to be full of cheery talk of newspapers
and books, the history of the present, and.
the history of the past, was to-day unusually grave
and silent.

*' I'm afraid you are not well, dear Miss Newton'*
said Marian, looking at her anxiously.

Oh, yes, my dear, I am well enough. You
know I am made of cast-iron, and except for the
toothache, or a cold in my head, I hardly know
what illness means. I am only a little thoughtful."


They walked a few paces in silence, and then Miss
Newton stopped suddenly to admire an approaching
carriage. *' What a stylish Victoria ! Why, I declare
there is Mr. Dalbrook, with a lady ! "

The carriage drew up as she spoke, and Theodore

alighted. Marian had reddened a little at the
mention of his name, hut the flush upon her cheek
deepened to crimson when she saw the lady in the
carriage, and as the lady got out and came towards
her the crimson faded to a deadly white.

Mercy, child, I am glad with all my heart to
find you," said Lady Cheriton, holding out both
her hands.

She was determined that there should he no doubt
in the young girl's mind as to her friendship and
indulgence  that there should be nothing in the
mode of her approach, in the tone of her voice, or
the expression of her countenance that could bruise
that broken reed. Love and pity looked out of
those lovely southern eyes, which even in mature
age retained much of their youthful beauty.

Mercy Porter went towards her, trembling, and
with eyes brimming with tears. The calm, self-restrained
nature had melted all at once at those
gentle words in the familiar voice which had given
her words of kindness and of praise in her desolate
childhood. The transformation filled Theodore
with wonder.

Dear Lady Cheriton, I thought you would long

ago have forgotten the wretched girl to whom you
were once so kind," she faltered.

No, Mercy, I have never forgotten you. I have
always been sorry  deeply sorry for you-and when
Mr. Dalbrook told me about having met a person
who interested him  a person associated with Cheriton
 I knew that person must be you. My dear
girl, I thank God that we have found you. My
cousin will call upon you tomorrow and talk to you
about your future  and of our plans for making
your life happier than it is."

** There is no need," said Mercy, quickly, " I get
on very well as I am. My life is quite good enough
for me. I hope for nothing better, wish for nothing
better."

"Nonsense, Mercy. His Lordship and I are
your friends, and we mean to help you."

I will accept help from no one, Lady Cheriton.
I made up my mind about that long ago. I can
earn my own living very well now. If ever my
fingers or my eyes fail me  I can go to the workhouse.
I am deeply thankful for your pity  but I
ask for no more, I will accept no more."

"We will see about that, Mercy," said Lady

Cberiton, with her gentle smile, quite unable to
estimate the mental force in opposition to her.

She could understand a certain resistance, the
pride of a sensitive nature painfully conscious of
disgrace, unable to forget the past. She was prepared
for a certain amount of difficulty in reconciling
this proud nature to the acceptance of benefits ; but
she never for one moment contemplated an implacable
resistance.

*' Let me see your friend, Mercy," she said, " the
lady who has been kind to you."

"Kind is a poor word. She has been my
angel of deliverance. She has saved me from the
great dismal swamp of self-abasement and despair."


Miss Newton had walked briskly ahead with
Theodore, so as to leave Lady Cheriton and Mercy
together. Mercy ran after her friend, and brought
her back a little way, as Lady Cheriton advanced to
meet her.

*' Miss Newton, my one true and good friend in
all this great world of London, and the only friend
of my miserable childhood, Lady Cheriton," said
Mercy, looking from one to the other with that in-vol.

III. H

tent look of thoughtful minds that work in narrow
grooves.

I thank you for being good to one in whose fate
I am warmly interested, Miss Newton," said Lady
Cheriton. " You have done the work of the good
Samaritan, and at least one wounded heart blesses

you."

They walked on a little way together, and Lady
Cheriton spoke of the old house and the old family,
the vanished race with which Sarah Newton had
been associated in her girlhood.

They are all dead, I understand ? " she said, in
conclusion.

Yes, there is none left of the old family. They
are not a fortunate race, and I fear there are few
who regret them ; but I cannot help feeling sorry
that they are all gone. They have passed away like
a dream when one awakens."

Lady Cheriton lingered on the river-side pathway
for nearly half-an-hour, talking to Mercy and Miss
Newton. Theodore left them together, after having
obtained Mercy's permission to call at her lodgings
on the following afternoon.

I saw her too.

Yes, but you must not love her.

I will not, as you do ; to worship her,
As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess ;
I love her as a woman."

A Decent-looking womaii Opened the door of the
house in Hercules Buildings, and ushered Mr. Dal-brook
up two flights of stairs to the small back-room
in which Mercy Porter had lived ber lonely life from
year's end to year's end. The tasteful arrangement
of that bumble chamber struck Theodore at the first
glance. He had seen such rooms at Cambridge,
where an undergraduate of small means bad striven
to work wonders with a few shabby old sticks that
had done duty for half-a-dozen other undergraduates,
and which had been but of poorest quality when
they issued, new and sticky with cheap varnish,
from the emporium of a local upholsterer.

Mercy was very pale, and although she received
her visitor with outward calmness, ho could see that

H 2

she had not yet recovered from yesterday's agitation.


'' What induced you to take so much trouble to
betray me, Mr. Dalbrook ? " she asked.

'' Betray is a very hard word, Miss Porter."

You don't suppose that I behoved yesterday's
meeting was accidental ? You took the trouble to
bring Lady Cheriton across my path in order to
satisfy your curiosity about my identity. Was that
generous ? "

God knows that it was meant in your best interests.
I knew that Lady Cheriton was your true
and loyal friend  that she had more of the mother's
instinct than your real mother, and that no pain
could possibly come to you from any meeting with
her. And then I had a very serious reason for
bringing you together. It was absolutely necessary
for me to make sure of your identity."

Why necessary? What can it matter to you
who I am ? "

Everything. I am the bearer of a very
Generous offer from Lord Cheriton  and it was
essential that I should make that offer to the right
person''

Mercy's face underwent a startling change at the
sound of Lord Cberiton's name. She had been
standing by the window in a listless attitude, just
where she had risen to receive her visitor. She drew
herself suddenly to her fullest height, and looked at
him with flushed cheeks and kindling eyes.

** I will accept no generosity from Lord Cheriton,"
she said. "I want nothing from him except to be
let alone. I want nothing from Lady Cheriton
except her sympathy, and I would rather have even
that at a distance. You have done the greatest
harm you could do me in bringing me face to face
with my old life."

Believe me I had but one feeling, anxiety for
your happiness."

"What is my happiness to you?" she retorted,
almost fiercely. " You are playing at philanthropy.
You can do me no good  3'ou may do me much evil.
You see me contented with my life  accustomed to
its hardships  happy in the possession of one true
friend. Why come to me with officious offers of
favours which I have never sought ? "

"You are ungenerous, and unjust. From the
first hour of our acquaintance I saw that you were

of a different clay to that of the women among whom
I found you  different by education, instinct, associations,
family history. How could I help being
interested in one who stood thus apart ? How could
I help wanting to know more of so exceptional a
life?"

"Yes, you were interested, as you might have
been in any other wreck  in any derelict vessel
stranded on a lonely shore, battered, broken, empty,
rudderless, picturesque in ruin. It was a morbid
interest, an interest in human misery."

He stated his commission plainly and briefly.
He told her that it was Lord Cheriton's earnest wish
to provide for her future life  that he was ready, and
even anxious, to settle a sum of money which would
ensure her a comfortable income for the rest of her
days. He urged upon her the consideration of the
new happiness, and larger opportunities of helping
others, which this competence would afford her;
but she cut him short with an impatient movement
of her head.

'' Upon what ground does he base his generous
offer ? " she asked coldly.

Upon the ground of his interest in sour mother

and yourself  an interest which it is only natural
for him to feel in one who was brought up on his
estate, and whose father was his friend. It may be
also that he feels himself in some wise to blame for
the great sorrow of your life."

Tell him that I appreciate his noble contempt
for money, his readiness to shed the sunshine of his
prosperity upon so remote an outcast as myself ; but
tell him also that I would rather starve to death,
slowly in this room, than I would accept the price
of a loaf of bread from his hands. Do not hesitate
to tell him this, in the plainest form of speech. It
is only right that he should know the exact measure
of my feelings towards him."

After this Theodore could only bow to her decision
and leave her.

'lord Cheriton is my cousin, and a man whom
I have every reason to regard with affection and
respect," he began.

She interrupted him sharply.

"He has never denied the cousinship, never
treated you as the dirt under his feet  never looked
down upon you from the altitude of his grandeur,
with insufferable patronage "

NevGv. He has been most unaffectedly my
friend, ever since I can remember."

'' Then you are right to think well of him  but
you must let me have my opinion in peace, even

although you are of his blood and I am nothing

to him. Good-bye. Forgive me if I have been
ungracious and ungrateful. I have no doubt you
meant well by me  only I would so much rather be
let alone. It did me no good to see Lady Cheriton
yesterday. My heart was tortured by the memories
her face recalled."

She gave him her hand, the thin white hand,
with taper fingers worn by constant work. It
was a very pretty hand, and it lay in his strong
grasp to-day for the first time, so reserved had
been her former greetings and farewells. He
looked at the delicate hand for a moment or two
before he let it go, and from the hand upwards
to the fair, finely-cut face, and the large, dark
grey eyes. That look of his startled her, the
hollow cheeks flushed, and the eyelids fell beneath
his steady gaze.

Good-bye, Mercy," he said, gently, " let me call
you Mercy, for the sake of the link between us 

the link of common recollections, and the sad secrets
of the past''

*' Call me what you like. It is not very probable
we shall meet often."

*you are very stubborn, cruel to yourself, and
more cruel to those who want to help you. Goodbye."


Good-bye," she echoed, almost in a whisper.

He went out into the shabby street haunted by
those sad uplifted eyes, and the hollow cheeks faintly
flushed with delicate bloom. How lovely she must
have been in her dawning womanhood, and how
closely she must have kept at home in the cottage
by the west gate, seeing that he who had been so
frequent a guest at Cheriton had never once met her
there.

He was not satisfied to submit to this total failure
of his mission without one further effort. He went
from Hercules Buildings to Wedgewood Street, and
saw his admirable Sarah Newton, into whose attentive
ear he poured the story of Mercy's obstinacy.

*' She is a strange girl  a girl who could live in
closest friendship with me all this time, and never
tell me the secret of her past life," said Miss

Newton thoughtfully. *' Why she should be so
perverse in her refusal of Lord Cheriton's offer I
can't imagine  but you may depend she has a
reason."

Theodore escorted Lady Cheriton back to Dorset-shire
by the afternoon train, but they parted
company at Wareham Station, he going on to Dorchester,
where his sisters received him with some
wonderment at his restlessness.

"It is rather a farce for you and Mr. Kamsay to
make engagements which you never intend to keep,"
said Sophia peevishly ; and it was thereupon
expounded to him that he and his friend had pledged
themselves to be present at a certain tennis party
upon the previous afternoon.

"I'm very sorry we both forgot all about it,"
he apologised, " but I don't suppose v/e were
missed."

I don't suppose you would have been," answered
his sister sulkily, "if there had been half a dozen
decent young men at the party ; but as Harrington
preferred the office to our society or our friends, and
as there were only three curates and one banker's

clerk at Mrs. Hazledeau's, 3-ou and Mr. Ramsay
would at least have been something'

"It is hardly worth any man's while to endure
an afternoon's boredom  to fetch and carry teacups
iu a sweltering sun, and play tennis upon an level
lawn, if he is only to count for something, a mere
make-weight."

"Oh, you Young men give yourselves such
abominable airs now-a-days," retorted Sophy, with a
manner which implied that the young men of former
generations had been modesty incarnate. "As for
your friend, he has made a mere convenience of this
house."

As how, Sophy ? "

"I don't think the fact requires explanation.
First he goes to the Priory, and then to Cheriton,
and then he is off to London, and then
he is to be back on Saturday in order to lunch
at the Priory on Sunday. If that is not making
an hotel of your father's house I don't know what
is."

Perhaps I have been too unceremonious, forgetting
that I no longer live here, that it behoves
me now, perhaps, to act in all things as a visitor.

It was I who made the engagements, Sophy. You
must not be angry with Ramsay."

"I am not angry. It cannot matter to me how
Mr. Ramsay treats this house. No doubt he thinks
himself a great deal too clever for our society,
although we are not quite so feather-headed as most
girls. He finds metal more attractive at the
Priory."

What do you mean, Sophy ? "
That he is over head and ears in love with
Juanita. It does not need a very penetrating person
to discover that."

*' What nonsense ! Why, he has not seen her
above three times."

Quite enough for a young man of his vehement
character."

"What can have put such an idea into your
head?"

*' His way of talking about her  the expression
of his face when he pronounces her name  the questions
he asked me about her, showing the keenest
interest in even the silliest details. What kind
of a girl was she before she married, and how long
had she known Sir Godfrey before they were

engaged, and had their love been a grand passion
full of romance and poetry, or only a humdrum
kind of affection encouraged by their mutual relations
? Idiotic questions of that kind could only be
asked by a man who was in love. And then how
eagerly he snapped at your suggestion that he should
go with you to the Priory next Sunday."

"It may be as you think," Theodore answered
gravely. " I know his fervid temperament about
most things ; but I did not think he was the kind
of man to fall in love  upon such very slight provocation."


She may have given more encouragement than
you suppose," said Sophy. "He is the kind of man
that a frivolous, half-educated girl would think
attractive. She would never find out the want of
depth under that arrogant, self-assured manner.
However, she has asked Janet and me for next
Sunday, and I shall soon see how the land lies.
You were always unobservant."

Theodore did not try to vindicate his character
as an observer, albeit he knew no look or tone
of his cousin's was likely to escape him ; that
even sharp-eyed malevolence could never watch

her more closely than love would watch out of his
eyes.

Yes ; it was not unlikely that Cuthbert admired
her too much for his own peace. He recalled
words which had passed unnoticed when they were
together. Poor Cuthbert ! He felt he had done
wrong in exposing his friend to such an ordeal.
Who could know her and not love her ?

For life must life, and blood must blood repay."

Cuthbert PvAiiSAT arriyecl at Dorchester on
Saturday just in tire to dress for dinner, and he
contrived to make himself so agreeable to all the
family in the course of that friendly meal, that
Janet and Sophia forgave him for his base desertion,
and Harrington forgave him for being a great deal
cleverer and happier than himself. He was in very
high spirits  had been working hard in London 
attending lectures  witnessing operations  and
looking after those gratis patients in the slums who
were his chief delight.

*' I love to find out what life means below the
surface," he said. " One only gets at realities when
one comes face to face with the struggle for existence.
The children  the poor pinched agonies whom one
looks at with a shudder, remembering that they are
the men and women of the future ! That is the
terrible point  to think that in those little half-starved

faces one sees the men who are to meet in
Trafalgar Square and unmake our smooth, easy
world  to think that in those wizened morsels of
humanity we have all the elements of discord and
destruction in the days to come. That is the appalling
thought."

*' It is a thought that should teach us our duty to
them," said Janet.

What do you take that duty to he ? "

To educate them ! "

Educate  yes  educate them in the ways of
health and cleanliness  after we have fed them.
That I take to he our primary duty to the children
as much as to the lower animals. You know the
old adage. Miss Dalbrook, meiis sana in corpore sand.
Did you ever hear of a sound and healthy mind in
an unsound scrofulous body? So long as we leave
the little children to semi starvation, we are sacrificing
to the Demon Scrofula, which is to our enlightened
age what the Demon Leprosy was to those
darker ages whose ignorance we prate about."

''I am not in favour of pauperism the working
classes," said Harrington.

** That idea of pauperism is a bugbear and a

stumbling-block in the path of benevolence. Do
YOU pauperise an agricultural labourer whose utmost
wages are fifteen shillings a week if you provide his
children with two good meals of fresh meat in the
seven days, and so grow better bone and sinew than
can be produced upon bread and dripping, or bread
and treacle ? Do you pauperise a man by giving him
a free supply of pure water, and larger, airier rooms
than his scanty wages will buy for him '? To subsidize
is not to pauperism, Mr. Dalbrook; and if
England is to hold together upon the old lines
during the coming centuries, the well-to-do will have
to help the poor upon a stronger and wider basis
than that on which they have helped them in the
past, and a good deal of the spare cash that is now
being spent on fine clothes and dinner parties will
have to be spent upon feeding and housing the
million."

The two young men drove over to Milbrook early
on Sunday morning, in order to attend morning service
at the picturesque old church. Matthew Dal-brook
and his daughters were to join them at the
Priory in time for luncheon, which was to be a
regular family party.

VOL. III. I

Cuthbert was silent for the greater part of the
drive, and Theodore was thoughtfully observant of
him. Yes, there might be something in Sophy's
idea. More than once during that long drive the
young man's face brightened with a sudden smile,
a smile of ineffable happiness, as of a dreaming
lover who sees the gates of his earthly paradise
opening, sees his mistress coming to meet him on
the threshold. Theodore's heart sank at the thought
that Sophia had hit upon the truth. Anyway there
was hopelessness in the idea. If it were to be Theodore's
blessed fate to see the one love of his life
victorious, soon or late, after long patience and
devoted sacrifice, Cuthbert must taste the bitterness
of having loved in vain. But he would hardly be
worthy of pity, perhaps, seeing that he had known
from the first how the land lay, seeing that honour
forbade his falling in love with Juanita.

But will honour make a man blind to beauty, deaf
to the music of a voice, impervious to the subtle
charms of all that is purest, best, and loveliest in
womanhood ? Theodore began to think that he had
done wrong in bringing his friend within the influence
of irresistible charms.

'' I was a fool to think that he could help himself;
I was a worse fool to suppose that she will ever care
for me  the humdrum cousin whom she has known
all her life  the country solicitor whose image she
has always associated with leases and hills of dilapidation
 a little more than a bailiff, and a little less
than a gentleman."

They consigned the dog-cart to the village ostler,
who was expiating the jovial self-indulgence of
Saturday night in the penitential drowsiness of Sunday
morning, and they were in their places in the
grey old church when Lady Carmichael came to the
chancel pew. Theodore's watchful eyes followed her
from her entrance in a halo of sunshine, which was
suddenly obscured as the curtain dropped behind her,
to the moment when she bowed her head in prayer.
He saw her face brighten as she passed the pew
where he and his friend were sitting, and he told
himself that it was Cuthbert's presence which conjured
up that happier light in her soft, dark eyes.
On the walk from the church to the Priory it was
with Cuthbert she talked  Cuthbert the irrepressible,
who had so much to say that he must needs find
listeners. It was Cuthbert who sat next her at luna

2

cleon, and who engrossed her attention throughout
the meal. It was Cuthbert who went through the
hot-houses, fern-houses, and greenhouses with her
after luncheon, and gave her practical lessons in
botany and entomology as they went along, and who
promised her some Austrian frogs. The day was
one long triumph for Cuthbert Ramsay, and he gave
himself up to the intoxication of the hour as a
drunkard surrenders to strong drink, unconditionally,
without thought of the morrow.

What do you think of your friend's infatuation
noiu?'' asked Janet, with her most biting accent,
as she and Theodore followed in the horticultural
procession, she carefully picking up her gown at
every one of those treacherous puddles which are to
be found in the best-regulated hot-houses. *' Have
you any doubt in your mind now ? "

*'No. I have no doubt."

The carriages were at the door half-an-hour afterwards,
and all through the homeward drive Cuthbert
was silent as the grave. Only as they came
into Dorchester did he find speech to say, 

*' I shall have to go back to town early tomorrow
morning, Theodore ! "

*' So soon. "What an unquiet spirit 3-ou are !
You'll come back to us next Friday or Saturday, I
hope."

I don't know. I'll try ; but I'm rather afraid
I can't."

Theodore did not press the point, and his friend
kept his word, and left by the first train on Monday
morning, after having been intolerably stupid on
Sunday evening, according to the sisters, who were
disposed to think themselves especially ill-use I by
Mr. Ramsay's obvious infatuation for Lady Carmichael.


I was beginning to respect Juanita for her conduct
in the difficult position of a young widow,"
said Sophia, " but I begin to fear that she is no
better than the rest of them, and that her leaving
off crape upon her last gowns is a sign that : he
means to marry again before the second year of her
widowhood is over."

Lady Cheriton's roses were in danger from a
failure of the water in that old-fashioned well which
had hitherto supplied the flower-gardens. There
Lad been an unusually long spell of dry weather

since the beginning of July, and the gardeners were
in despair. When Theodore went over to the Chase
with his portmanteau, in accordance with an engagement
made the previous week, he found that Lord
Cheriton had that morning given an order for the
sinking of the old well from twenty to thirty feet
deeper.

** There is plenty, of water, my lord," said the
head gardener, " if we only go deep enough
for it."

*' Very well, Mckenzie, go as deep as you like,
sa long as you don't go below the water-bearing
strata. You had better put on plenty of hands.
Her ladyship is uneasy about her roses, seeing how
you have been stinting them lately."

*' It has been hard work, my lord, to do our duty
by the roses, and keep the lawns in decent order.
The ground would be as hard as iron if we didn't
use a good deal of water for the grass."

Get to work, Mckenzie, and don't waste time
in talking about it. Drive over to Gaby's, and
tell him to send some good men."

This conversation took place upon the terrace
directly after Theodore's arrival; and when the

gardener had gone off to the stables to get the ,
Lord Cheriton and his cousin
walked in the direction of the well.

The well was in one of the kitchen-gardens, quite
the oldest bit of garden ground at Cheriton, a
square garden of about two acres, shut in with high
crumbling old red brick walls, upon which grew
blue gages and William pears, egg-plums and
apricots, attaining more or less to perfection as the
aspect favoured them. It was a pleasant garden to
dream in upon a summer afternoon, for there was
an air of superabundant growth that was almost
tropical in the century old espaliers, albeit they had
long ceased to produce meritorious fruit, and in the
sprawling leaves and yellow blossoms of the vegetable
marrows which seemed to be grown for no purpose
except to produce champion gourds or pumpkins,
to be ultimately hung up as ornaments in the
gardener's cottage, or to rot in a corner of the
greenhouse. There is always one old greenhouse in
such a garden given over to preserving spiders and
accumulating rubbish.

In the middle of a vegetable marrow warren stood
the well  a well of eight feet in diameter, surrounded

by a low brick wall, of that same bright
red brick which crumbled behind the blue gages
and the egg-plums, and which the birds pecked and
perforated, for very wantonness. It was a well of
the old pattern, with a ponderous wooden roller, and
an iron spindle, which had wound up water from
those same cool depths for over a hundred years.
It had run dry often, in the time of the Strangways,
that good old well ; but no Strangway had ever
thought of improving anything upon the estate ;
so in seasons of drought the flowers had drooped
and the turf had withered unheeded by the proprietors
eye.

Mr. Gaby's men appeared after their dinner, and
got seriously to work by about three o'clock, at
which hour Theodore and Lady Cheriton were
strolling in the rose garden, while the master of the
house sat in the library reading. Theodore had
observed a marked change in his cousin since his
last visit to the Chase. There was a worried lookin
Lord Cheriton' s face which had not been there
even after the shock of the murder, a look of nervous
apprehension which showed itself from time to
time in a countenance where firmness of character

and an absolute fearlessness had been hitherto the
strongest characteristics.

He had not yet told his lordship the result of his
interview with Mercy Porter. He had waited till an
opportunity for quiet, confidential talk should come
about naturally, and that opportunity now occurred.
Lady Cheriton left him after half-an-hour's review
of the roses, and he went through the open window
into the library where Lord Cheriton sat in his
large arm-chair at his own particular table, reading
the political summing-up in the last Quarterly.

Shall I be disturbing you if I sit here ? " asked
Theodore, taking a volume from the table where the
newest books were always to be found.

*' On the contrary, I shall be very glad of a little
conversation. I have been struggling through an
analysis of last session, which is all weariness and
vexation of spirit. The session was dull, the commentary
is duller. I am anxious to know how you
got on with Mrs. Porter's daughter."

*' Very badly, I regret to say, from our point of
view. She rejects your generous offer. She prefers
her present hard life, with its independence. She
will accept no obligation from any one."

Humph ! She must be a curious young woman,"
said Lord Cheriton, with a vexed air. ''I should
have liked very much to have made her life bright
and easy, if she would have let me  for her father's
sake. On what ground did she refuse my offer ? "

On the ground of preferring to work for her
living, and to live a hard life. She has taken that
upon herself, I believe, as an expiation for her past
errors, although she did not say that in so many
words. She is wonderfully firm. I never saw such
a resolute temper in so young  and so gentlemanlike
 a woman."

"You tried to overcome her objections, you represented
to her how easy and pleasant her life might
be in some picturesque village  among the hills and
lakes, or by the sea  and how she might live among
people who would know nothing of her past history,
who would grow to be fond of her for her own
sake."

I urged all this upon her. I am as anxious as
you are that she should leave that dreary attic  that
monotonous labour  but nothing I could say was of
the least use. She was resolute  she vould accept
nothing from you."

*' From me  ah, that is it ! " cried Lord Cheriton,
suddenly. " Had the offer come from any one
else she might have been less stubborn. But from
me she will take nothing  not a loaf of bread if
she were starving. That is the explanation of her
hardness  it is to me she is adamant. Tell me the
truth, Theodore. Don't spare my feelings. This
girl hates me, I suppose ? "

I fear she has a deeply-rooted prejudice against
you. She may  most unjustly'  blame you for
her misery, because Colonel Tremayne was your
friend."

Yes, that is her feeling, no doubt ; it is on that
account she hates me. Perhaps she is justified in
her anger. I ought to have shot that scoundrel.
Had we both lived fifty years sooner I suppose I
should have shot him."

I don't think you could have been called upon
to do that even by the old code of honour. Mercy
was not allied to you "

*' No, but she dwelt at my gates. She was under
my protection  she had no other man living to
defend her. I ought to have punished her seducer
it was incumbent on me to do it. Because there

was no one else," he added slowly, after a long
pause.

'' It may be on that account she rejects your
generous offer. I cannot pretend to interpret her
feelings, but there was certainly some strong personal
prejudice on her part. She was deeply
moved. She burst into a passion of sobs. * Not
from him,' she cried, ' I will accept nothing from
him. Of all the men upon this earth he shall bethe
last to help me ! ' "

Lord Cheriton flung the Quarterly from him
with a passionate gesture, as he started to his feet
and began to walk up and down the long clear space
in front of the windows.

*' Theodore," he said suddenly, " you have not
yet come face to face with all the problems of life.
Perhaps you have not yet found out how hard it is
to help people. I would have given much to be
able to help that girl  to assure her an easy and
reputable existence  the refinements of life amidst
pleasant surroundings. What would it matter tome
whether I allowed her one hundred or two hundred
a year ? All I desire is that her life should be
happy. And of deliberate malice  of sheer perversity

 she rejects my help, she dooms herself to
the seamstress' slavery, and to a garret in Lambeth.
My God, to think that sith all the will and all the
power to help her, I cannot come between her and
that sordid misery. It is hard, Theodore, it is very
hard upon a man like me. There is nothing I hold
of this v;orld's goods that I have not worked for
honestly ; and when I want to do good for others
with what I have won, I am barred by their folly.
It is enough to make me mad."

D

Never before had Theodore seen this self-abandonment
in his stately cousin, the man who bore in
every tone and every gesture the impress of his
acknowledged ascendency over his fellow-men. To
see such a man as this so completely unhinged by a
woman's perversity was a new thing to Theodore
Dalbrook ; and his heart went out to his kinsman as
it had never done before.

My dear Cheriton, you have done all that was
in your power to do for that mistaken young-woman,
" he said, holding out his hand, which the
elder man grasped warmly. " Whatever wrong you
may have unwittingly brought about by the presence
of a blackguard under your roof, you have done

your Lest to atone for that wrong. The most sensitive,
the most punctilious of men could do no
more.

I thank you, Theodore, for your sympathy.
Yes, I have done my hest for her  you will hear
witness to that."

"A father could scarcely do more for an erring
daughter. I only wish her mother felt half as
kindly towards her as you, upon whom her claim is
so slight."

'' No, no ; it is a substantial claim. She is
fatherless, and her mother is dependent upon me.
I stand, as it were, ii loco parentis. Well, we will
say no more about her ; she must go her own way.
Only, if ever you find an opportunity of helping her
for me, you will do me a great favour hy taking
prompt advantage of it."

I shall gladly do so. I am interested in her for
her own sake, as well as for yours."

' You are a good fellow, Theodore, and I know
you wish us well. I will go a step further than that
and say I know that I can trust you."

This was said with an earnestness which impressed
Theodore. It seemed to him almost as if

his kinsman foresaw that inevitable hour in which
there must be perfect unreserve between them  in
which the younger man would have to say to his
senior and superior in rank, " I know the secret of
your earlier years. I know the dark cloud that has
overshadowed your life."

They talked for a little while of indifferent subjects,
and then Lord Cheriton proposed a stroll in
the direction of the well.

'' I should like to see whether those fellows have
begun work," he said.

The old garden looked its sleepiest in the
westering sunlight, but there was business going
on there nevertheless, and a great heap of damp
clay had been flung out by the side of the low
brick parapet. Two men were at work below,
and there were two men above, while a fifth, a
foreman and leading light, looked on and gave
directions.

*' Glad to see you've tackled the job. Carter,"
said Lord Cheriton.

*' Yes, my lord, we've got on to it pretty well.
Could I have a word with your lordship ? "

*' Certainly, as many words as you like. How

mysterious you look, Carter ! There is nothing in
your communication that Mr. Dalbrook is not to
hear, I suppose ? "

No, my lord, Mr. Dalbrook don't matter; but
I thought you wouldn't care for everybody to know,
lest it should get round to her ladyship, and give
her a scare."

"What are you driving at. Carter, with your
ladyships and your scares ? Have you seen a ghost
at the bottom of the well ? "

''No, my lord, but the men found this in the
surface clay, and I thought it might have some
bearing upon  last year  the murder."

He dropped out his words hesitatingly, as if he
hardly dared approach that ghastly theme, and then
took something out of his jacket pocket, and handed
it to Lord Cheriton.

It was a Colt's revolver, by no means of the
newest make, rusted by lying long under water.
The foreman had amused his leisure since the discovery
in trying to rub off the rust with a large
cotton handkerchief, assisted by his corduroy coat-sleeve,
and had succeeded in polishing a small silver
plate upon the butt of the pistol so as to make the

initials ** T. D." engraved upon it easily decipherable.


There was not much in the discovery perhaps, but
by the ghastly change in Lord Cheriton's face
Theodore saw that to him at least it appeared of
fatal significance. His hand shook as it held the
pistol, his eyes had a look of absolute horror as they
scrutinized it ; and nothing could be more obvious
than the effort with which he controlled his agitation,
and looked from the builder's foreman to
Theodore with an assumption of tranquillity.

It may mean much, or nothing. Carter," he
said, putting the pistol in his coat pocket. " It was
quite right of you to bring the matter before me."

I thought the initials on the pistol might lead
to something being found out, my lord," said the
foreman. ** I don't think there can be much doubt
the murderer chucked it in there."

"Don't you? I have gone into the subject of
circumstantial evidence a little deeper than you have,
Carter ; it was my trade, don't you know, just as
laying bricks was yours, and I can tell you that the
odds are ten to one against this pistol having
belonged to the murderer. Do you think it likely

VOL. III. K

that the man who shot Sir Godfrey Carmichael
would have gone out of his way to throw his pistol
down that particular well ? "

I don't know about that, my lord ; it would have
been a safe hiding-place, if the water hadn't given
out  and it would be in his way if he were making
for the West Gate. He could hardly have taken a
shorter cut than across this garden."

** Perhaps not  if both the garden doors were
open that night."

I don't think anybody ever saw them shut, my
lord, night or day," answered Carter, with respectful
persistency.

Theodore knew by the very look of the clumsy
wooden doors, pushed back against the old wall,
with rusty hinges, and with the tendrils of vine or
plum tree growing over their edges, that the man
was right. The path across this garden and the
next garden led in a direct line to the West Lodge,
and it was this way by which the servants went on
most of their errands to the village.

The one idea suggested by the choice of that
hiding-place was that the person who threw away
that pistol was familiar with the premises. The

well was about thirty feet away from the path, and
screened by the old espaliers. There was a gap
in the espaliers where an ancient and cankered apple
tree had been taken out, and it was by this opening
that the gardeners generally went to draw water.
They had trodden a hard foot track in their going
and coming.

It was always possible that a stranger exploring
the grounds furtively and in haste might have been
sharp enough to hit upon the well as a safe and
handy hiding-place. It would, of course, have been
vital to the murderer to get rid of his weapon as
soon as possible after the deed was done, lest he
should be taken red-handed and with that piece of
evidence upon him.

Theodore saw in that pistol with the initials
*' T. D.," confirmatory evidence against the husband
of Mrs. Danvers, the one person in the world who
had ground for an undying hatred of Lord Cheriton
and his race. He made no remark upon the discovery
of the weapon, fearing to say too much ; and
he waited quietly to see how his kinsman would act
in the matter. That ghastly change in Lord Cheriton's
countenance as he examined the pistol,

K 2

suggested that lie had come to the same conclusion
as Theodore. Remorse and horror could hardly
have been more plainly expressed by the human
countenance : and what remorse could he more
terrible than that of the man who saw the sin of his
youth visited upon his innocent daughter ?

Shall you take any steps with reference to this
discovery ? " asked Theodore, when they had gone
half way back to the house in absolute silence.

*' What steps can I take, do you think ? Send
for another London detective  or for the same man
again  and give him this pistol ? To what end ?
He would be no nearer finding the murderer because
of the finding of the pistol."

*' The initials might lead to identification."

*' Did you never hear of such a thing as a secondhand
pistol ? And do you think an assassin would
make use of a pistol with his own initials upon it to
commit murder ? I do not."

*not the professional assassin. But we are all
agreed that this murder was an act of vengeance 
for some reason at present unknown  and the semi-lunatic
who would commit murder for such a motive
would not be likely to do his work very neatly. His

brain would be fevered by passion or alcohol, in all
probability, and be would go to work blindly."

"That is no more than a theory, and my experience
has shown me that such theories are generally falsified
by fact. The murder was so far neatly done
that the murderer got clear off, in spite of a most
rigorous search. I doubt if the pistol, with
initials which may belong to anybody in the world,
will help us to track him after more than a
year."

'' Then you mean to do nothing in the matter ? "

I think not. I cannot see my way to doing
anything at present ; but if you like to take the
pistol to Scotland Yard and see what impression it
makes upon the experts there "

I should much like to do so. I cannot ignore
the fact that so long as Sir Godfrey's murderer
remains undiscovered, there is a possibility of peril
for you and for Juanita, and for Juanita's child.
Who can tell whether that deadly hatred is appeased
whether the man who killed your daughter's husband
is not on the watch to kill you or your daughter
when he sees his opportunity ? "

** As for myself, I must take my chance. I

would to God that the ball had struck me instead of
my son-in-law. It would have been better  a lighter
chastisement. I have lived my life. I have done
all I ever hoped to do in this world. A few years,
more or less, could matter very little to me. And
yet, life is sweet, Theodore, life is sweet ! However
heavily we are handicapped, we most of us
would choose to finish our race."

There was infinite melancholy in his tone, the
melancholy of a man who sees the shadows of a
great despair darkening round him, the melancholy
of a man who gives up the contest of life, and feels
that he is beaten.

*' Do not say anything to my wife about this business,"
he said; "let her be happy as long as she
can. She has not forgotten last summer, but she
is beginning to be something like what she was
before that blow fell upon us. The advent of
Juanita's baby has worked wonders. There is something
to look forward to in that child's existence.
Life is no longer a cul-de-sac."

There is one thing to be done," said Theodore,
after an interval of silence. *' The bullet was kept,
of course."

Yes, it is in the possession of the police, I
believe."

"Would it not be well to ascertain if it fits the
pistol you have in your pocket ? "

Yes. I will go to the station tomorrow and
look into that."

There was no more said about the pistol that
evening. Theodore felt that it would be cruelty to
dwell upon the subject, seeing that his kinsman had
been deeply affected by the discovery, and that he
was oppressed by a gloom which he strove in vain
to shake off.

It was evident to Theodore that those initials on
the pistol had a terrible meaning for Lord Cheriton,
that he recognized in those initials the evidence of
an injured husband's vengeance, a hatred which had
been undiminished by the lapse of years.

He told himself that the tardiness of that
revenge might be accounted for by various contingencies,
any one of which would lessen the improbability
of that long interval between the wrong done
and the retribution exacted. It might be that the
murderer had been an exile in a distant world. It
might be that he had been a criminal fretting himself

against the bars of a felon's prison, nursing
his anger in the dull, dead days of penal servitude.
Such things have been.

It was clear to Theodore Dalbrook that in those
initials upon the Colt's revolver lay the clue to the
murderer, and that Lord Cheriton shrank with
horror from the revelation which those two letters
might bring about. Yet, whatever evil might come
upon the master of Cheriton out of the secret past,
it was vital that the murderer should be found, lest
his second crime should be more hideous than his
first; and Theodore was resolved that he would spare
no effort in the endeavour to find him, living or
dead.

God grant that I may find a grave rather than
the living man," he thought, " for Cheriton's sake.
God grant that he may be spared the humiliation of
having his story told to all the world."

He went into Cheriton village early upon the following
afternoon, and dropped in upon the doctor,
an old inhabitant, whose father and grandfather
before him had prescribed for all the parish, rich
and poor. Mr. Dolby, par excellence Dr. Dolby, was
a bachelor, a spare, sharp-visaged man of about

forty, social and expansive, a keen sportsman, and a
good billiard player, a man whose lines had been set
in pleasant places, for he had inherited a roomy old
cottage, with capacious stabling, and twenty acres of
the fattest meadow land in Cheriton parish, and heled
exactly that kind of life which his soul loved.
It would have been no gain to such a man to have
changed places with Baron Rothschild or Lord
Salisbury. He would have been in all that constitutes
human happiness a loser by such an exchange.
So cheery a person was naturally popular in a narrow
world like Cheriton, and Mr. Dolby was a
general favourite, a favourite in polite society, and
in the billiard room at the Cheriton Arms, which,
in default of a club, served as the afternoon and
evening rendezvous for lawyer, doctor, and the
tenant-farmers of a gentlemanly class  the smock-frock
farmers and tradespeople having their own
particular meeting place at the Old House at Home,
a public-house at the other end of the village.
Theodore had known Mr. Dolby from his childhood,
and the medical adviser of Cheriton was an occasional
dropper-in at the luncheon table in Cornhill,
when business transactions with his tailor or his

banker took him to the County town. There was
nothing unusual, therefore, in Theodore's afternoon
call at Dovecotes, a somewhat picturesque name
which had been given to the doctor's domicile by
his predecessor, who had devoted his later years to
an ardent cultivation of Barbs and Jacobins and
other aristocratic birds, and who had covered a
quarter of an acre of garden ground with pigeon-houses
of various construction.

Theodore found Mr. Dolby smoking his afternoon
pipe in the seclusion of his surgery. He had made
a long morning round, had driven something
between twenty and thirty miles, and considered
himself entitled to what he called his opium cum
whisky and water, which refreshment stood on a
small table at his elbow while he lolled in his
capacious easy chair.

He welcomed his visitor with effusion, and
insisted on calling for another syphon, and having
another little table arranged at the elbow of the
other easy chair.

Make yourself comfortable, old chap, and let us
have a jaw," he said. "I haven't seen you forages.
Are you at the Chase ? "

They talked of the usual village topics, glanced
at the great world of politics, speculated upon the
prospects of the shooting season, and then Theodore
approached the real business of his visit.

There is a fellow I am interested in from a
business point of view," he began, ** who has been
hanging about this place, off and on, for the last
five-and-twenty years, I believe, though I have never
happened to meet him. He is a drinking man,
and altogether a bad lot ; but it is my business to
bunt him down."

On account of some property, I suppose ? "

*' Yes, on account of some property. Now, I
know what an observer you are, Dolby, and what a
wonderful memory you have "

*'I haven't wasted it up in London," interjected
Dolby. "A week in Oxford Street and the Strand
would take ten years off my memory. It's pretty
clear at present, thank God. "Well, now, what
about this fellow, what kind of a fellow is he  a
gentleman or a cad ? "

He was once a gentleman, but he may have
tumbled pretty low by this time. He was going
down hill at a good pace five-and-twenty years ago."

Egad, then he must be at the bottom of the
hill, I take it. What is he like  fat or lean, dark
or fair, short or tall ? "

'*A tall man, fair complexion, a man who has
once been handsome, a showy-looking man,"
answered Theodore, quoting the house-agent.

That will do. Yes, just such a man as that
was at the Arms one night  six  eight  upon my
word I believe it must have been ten years ago. A
man who put on a good deal of side, though his
clothes were no end seedy  ragged edges to his
trousers, don't you know  and though his hand
shook like an aspen leaf. I played a fifty game
with him, and I should say, though I beat him
easy, that he had once been a fine player. He was
in wretched form, poor creature, but "

*' Ten years ago, do you really think it was as
long ago you saw him ? "

"I know it was. It would be in seventy-four,
that was the year Potter was returned for Screw-mouth.
I remember we were all talking of the
election the night that fellow was there. Yes, I
remember him perfectly ; a tall, fair man, a wreck,
but with the traces of former good looks. I fancy

he must have been a soldier. He slept at the Arms
that night, and I met him rather early next morning,
before nine o'clock, coming away from the
Chase  met him within ten yards of the West
Lodge."

Did he talk about Lord Cheriton ? "

'* A good deal  talked rather wild, too  and
would have blackguard your cousin if we hadn't
shut him up pretty sharply. He pretended to have
been intimate with him before he made his way at
the Bar, and he talked in the venomous way a man
who has been a failure very often does talk about a
man who has been a success. It's only human
nature, I suppose. There's a spice of venom inhuman
nature."

'have you never seen this man at Cheriton
since that occasion  never within the last ten
years?"

Never, and I should be inclined, looking at the
gentleman from a professional point of view, to
believe that he must have been under the turf for a
considerable portion of that period. I don't think
there could have been three years' life in the man I
played billiards with that evening. Hard lines for

him, poor beggar, if there was property coming to
him. He looked as if he wanted it bad enough."

What had he been doing at the Chase, do you
suppose ? '*

'*I haven't the least idea. I was driving in my
cart when I passed him. I looked back and
watched him for two or three minutes. He was
walking very slowly, and with a languid air, like a
man who was not used to walking. Ten years  no,
Theodore  I don't think it's possible such a shaky
subject as that could have lasted ten years. One
certainly does see very miserable creatures crawling
on for years after they have been ticketed for the
undertaker  but this man  no  I don't think he
could hold out long after that October morning. I
fancy he was booked for a quick passage."

He may have pulled himself together, and
turned over a new leaf."

Too old, and too far gone for that."

Or what if he had done something bad and got
himself shut up for a few years ?"

'* Penal servitude do you mean ? Well, that
might do something ! It's a very severe regimen
for the habitual drunkard  and it means kill or

cure. In this case I should say decidedly
kill."

But it might cure."

I should think the chances of cure were as two
in two hundred. I won't say it would be impossible,
not haying examined the patient  but sofar
as observation can teach a man anything,
observation taught me that the case was hopeless."


And yet it is my belief that this man was at
Cheriton some time last year. You know everybody,
and talk to everybody, my dear Dolby. I
wish you'd find out for me whether I am right ? "

"I'll do my best," answered Mr. Dolby cheerfully.
*' If the man has been seen by anybody in
the village I ought to be able to hear about him.
Everybody was tremendously on the look out last
year, after the murder, and no stranger could have
escaped observation."

"Perhaps not  but before the murder "

Anybody who had been seen shortly before the
murder would have been remembered and talked
about. You can have no idea of the intense excitement
that event caused among us. 'We seemed to

talk of nothing else, and to think of nothing else
for months."

'' And you suppose that if the man I want had
been about  for a few hours only, just long enough
to come and go away again on that fatal night, he
would have been remembered ? "

I am sure of it. He would have inevitably
been taken for the murderer. Remember, we were
all on the alert, ready to fix upon the first 
person our memory could suggest
to us."

"Do you think Johnson would remember the
man ? "

Johnson was the proprietor of the Cheriton Arms.

'' My dear fellow, did you ever find Johnson's
memory available about any transaction six months
old? Johnson's memory is steeped in beer, buried
in flesh. Johnson is a perambulating barrel of
forgetfulness  a circum ambulatory hogshead of
stupidity. Ask Johnson to tell you the Christian
name of his grandmother, and I would venture a
new hat he would be unable to answer you. There
is nothing to be got out of mine host of the Cheriton
Arms. Be sure of that."

** I'm afraid you are right," said Theodore.

He felt as if he had come to a point at which
there was no thoroughfare. There was the pistol,
with the initials " T. D.," and he had made up his
mind that the man for whom those initials had been
engraved was the man who gave his name as Danvers
when he called upon the house-agent, the man
whose wife had been known for years as Mrs. Danvers.
He had made up his mind that this man and
no other had murdered Godfrey Carmichael  that
many years after the wife's death the husband had
returned from exile or imprisonment, embittered so
much the more, so much the more Vindictive, so
much the more malignant for all that he had suffered
in that interval, and had taken the first opportunity
to attack a hated household. That he would
strike again if he should be allowed to live and beat
large Theodore had no doubt. A second murder,
and a third murder, seemed the natural sequence of
the first. He remembered the murders of the
Jermys at Cranfield Hall  the savage hatred which
tried to slay four people, two of whom were utterly
unconnected with the wrong that called for vengeance.
In the face of such a story as that of the

VOL. III. L

murderer Rush, who could say that Theodore's
apprehension of an insatiable malignity, wreaking
itself in further bloodshed, was groundless ?

He left Dovecotes disheartened, hardly knowing
what his next step was to be, and very hopeless of
tracking a man who had so contrived as to be unseen
upon his deadly errand. He must have come and
gone verily like a thief in the night, sheltered by
darkness, meeting no one ; and yet there was the
evidence of the servants at the inquest, who swore
to having heard mysterious footsteps outside the
house late at night upon more than one occasion
shortly before the murder. If the murderer had
been about upon several nights, creeping round by
the open windows of the reception rooms, watching
his opportunity, what had he done with himself in
the day? "Where had he hidden himself; how had
he evaded the prying eyes of a village, which is
all eyes, all ears for the unexplained stranger ?

"When haughty expectations prostrate lie
And grandeur crouches like a guilty thing."

Theodore walked moodily along the lane leading
to the West Gate, brooding over discrepancies and
difficulties in the case which he had set himself
to unravel. As he drew near Mrs. Porter's cottage
lie saw Lord Cheriton come out of the porch, unattended.
He came slowly down the steps to the
gate, with his head bent, and his shoulders stooping
wearily, an attitude which was totally unlike his
usual erect carriage, an attitude which told distinctly
of mental trouble.

Theodore overtook him, and walked by his side,
at the risk of being considered intrusive. He was
very curious as to his kinsman's motive for visiting
Mrs. Porter, after yesterday's conversation about
Mercy.

L 2

** Have you been trying to bring about a reconciliation
between mother and daughter ?" he asked.

No. I have told you that little good could result
from bringing those two obstinate spirits together.
You have seen for yourself what the daughter can
be  how perverse, how cruel, what a creature of
prejudice and whim. The mother's nature is still
harder. What good could come of bringing such a
daughter back to such a mother ? No, it was with
no hope of reconciliation that I called upon Mrs.
Porter. I have been thinking very seriously of your
friend Ramsay's suggestion of mental trouble. I
regret that I did not act upon the hint sooner, and
get my friend Mainwaring to see her, and advise
upon the case. I shall certainly consult him about
her  but as he has a very important practice, and a
large establishment under his care, it may be very
difficult for him to come to Cheriton. I think, therefore,
it might be well to send her up to the neighbourhood
of London  to some quiet northern
suburb, for instance, within half-an-hour's drive of
Mainwaring's asylum, which is near Cheshunt ;
then, if it should be deemed advisable to place her
under restraint for a time  though I cannot suppose

that likely  the business could be easily accomplished.


Your idea then would be "

*' To take her up to London, with her servant, as
soon as I have found comfortable lodgings for her
in a quiet neighbourhood. I have proposed the
journey to her this afternoon, on the ground of her
being 'out of health and in need of special advice.
I told her that people had remarked upon her altered
appearance, and that I was anxious she should have
the best medical care. She did not deny that she
was ailing. I think, therefore, there will be very
little difficulty in getting her away when I am ready
to remove her."

What is your own impression as to her mental
condition ? "

'' I regret to say that my impression very much
resembles that of your friend. I see a great change
in her since I last had any conversation with her.
Yes, I fear that there is something amiss, and that
it is no longer well for her to live in that cottage,
with a young girl for her only companion. It would
be far better for her to be in a private asylum 
where, hers being a very mild case, life might be

made easy and agreeable for her. I know my friend
Manuring to be a man of infinite benevolence, and
that there would be nothing wanting to lighten her
burden''

He sighed heavily. There was a look in his face
of unutterable care, of a despondency which saw no
issue, no ray of light far off in the thickening gloom.
Theodore thought he looked aged by several years
since yesterday, as if the evidence of the pistol had
struck him to the heart.

He knows now that it was his own sin that
brought about this evil," thought Theodore.

He could conceive the agony of the father's heart,
knowing that for his own wrong-doing his innocent
daughter had been called upon to make so terrible
an expiation. He could penetrate into the dark
recesses of the sinner's mind, where remorse for
that early error, and for all the false steps which it
had necessitated, dominated every other thought.
Till yesterday James Dalbrook might have supposed
his sin a thing of the past, atoned for and forgiven
its evil consequences suffered in the past, the
account ruled off in the book of fate, and the
acquittance given. To-day he knew that his sin had

cost him his daughter's happiness; and over and
above that horror of the past there lay before him
the hazard of some still greater horror in the future.
Could anybody wonder that his eyes were sunken
and dull, as they never had been before within Theodore's
memory ? Could anybody wonder at the
strained look in the broad, open forehead, beneath
which the eyes looked out wide apart under strongly-marked
brows ; or at the hard lines about the mouth,
which told of sharpest mental pain ?

Late that evening, when Lady Cheriton had gone
to bed, Theodore approached the subject of the pistol.

*' Did you compare the ball with the revolver that
was found yesterday? " he asked.

*' Yes. The ball fits the bore. I don't know
that the fact goes to prove much  but so far as it
goes it is now in the knowledge of our local police.
Unfortunately they are not the most brilliant intellects
I know of."

If you will let me have the pistol to-night before
we go to bed I will go up to town by an early train
tomorrow and take it to Scotland Yard, as j'ou
suggested."

"I suggested nothing of the kind, my dear
Theodore. I attach very little importance to the
discovery of the pistol as a means towards discovering
the murderer. I said you might take it to
Scotland Yard if you liked  that was all."

I should like to do so. I should feel better
satisfied "

** Oh, satisfy yourself, by all means," interrupted
Lord Cheriton irritably. 'you are great upon the
science of circumstantial evidence. There is the
pistol," taking it out of a drawer in the large writing
table. *' Do what you like with it."

*' You are not offended with me I hope ? "

''No, I am only tired  tired of the whole business,
and of the everlasting talk there has been
about it. If it is a vendetta, if the hand that
killed Godfrey Carmichael is to kill me, and my
daughter, and her son  if my race is to be eradicated
from the face of this earth by an unappeasable
hatred I cannot help my fate. I cannot parry the
impending blow. Nor can you or Scotland Yard
protect me from my foe, Theodore."

Scotland Yard may find your foe and lock him
up."

I doubt it. But do as you please''

Theodore's train left Wareham at nine o'clock.
There was a still earlier train at seven, by which
farmers and other enterprising spirits who wanted to
take tinge by the forelock were accustomed to travel ;
but to be in time for the nine o'clock train Theodore
had to leave Cheriton at a quarter to eight, and to
drive to the distant town in the dog-cart made and
provided for station work, and drawn by one of two
smart cobs kept for the purpose.

He left the park by the West Gate. He had to
wait longer than usual for the opening of the gate ;
and when the chubby-checked maid-servant came
down the steps with a key in her hand and unlocked
the gate there was that in her manner which indicated
a fluttered mind.

*' Oh, if you please, sir, I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long, but I couldn't find the key just at
first, though I thought I'd hung it up on the nail
last night after I locked the gate  but I was so
upset at my mistress leaving so suddenly  never
saying a word about it beforehand  that I hardly
knew what I was doing."

Theodore stopped the groom as he drove through
the gate. He had a few minutes to spare, and could
afford himself time to question the girl, who had a
look of desiring to be interrogated.

** What is this about your mistress leaving suddenly
? " he asked. "Do you mean that Mrs.
Porter has gone away  on a journey ? "

Yes, indeed, sir. She that never left home
before since I was a child  for I've known her ever
since I can remember, and never knew her to be
away for so much as a single night. And the first
thing this morning when I was lighting the kitchen
fire she opens the door and just looks in and says 
 Martha, I'm going to London. Don't expect me
back till you see me. There's a letter on the parlour
table,' she says. * Let it lie there till it's called for
don't you touch it, nor yet the box,' and she shuts
the kitchen door and walks off just as quietly as if
she was going to early church, as she has done many
a time before it was daylight. I was that upset that
I knelt before the stove a good few minutes before
I could realize that she was gone  and then I run
out and looked after her. She was almost out of
sight, walking up the lane towards Cheriton."

Had she no luggage  did she take nothing with
her?"

'* Nothing. Not so much as a hand-hag."

What time was this ? "

*' It struck six a few minutes after I went back to
the kitchen."

What about the letter  and the box your mistress
spoke of ? "

There they are, sir, on the parlour table, where
she left them. I';;i not going to touch them," said
the girl, with emphasis. " She told me not, and I'm
not going to disobey her."

To whom is the letter addressed ? "

"Do you mean who it's for, sir?"

"Yes."

It's for his lordship  and it's to lie there till
his lordship sends for it."

In that case I may as well give it to his lordship's
servant, who can take it up to the house presently'*

I don't know if that will be right, sir. She
said it was to be called for."

Then we call for it. I, his lordship's cousin,
and James, his lordship's groom. Won't that do
for you?"

I suppose that will be right, sir," the girl
answered doubtfully. " The letter and the box are
both on the table, and I wasn't to interfere with
either of 'em, and I'm not going to it. That's all
I can say."

The girl was swollen with the importance of her
mission as being associated with a mystery, and she
was also in lively dread of her very severe mistress,
who might come down the lane at any moment and
surprise her in some act of dereliction.

Theodore passed her by and went into the sitting-room
where he had taken tea with the Dempster
and Cuthbert Ramsay.

A letter lay on the carved oak table in front of
the window, and beside the letter there stood a
walnut-wood box, eighteen inches by nine. The
letter was addressed, in a bold, characteristic hand,
to Lord Cheriton. To be called for. The box had
a small brass plate upon the lid, and a name engraved
upon the plate 

Thomas C. Darcy,
9th Foot.

No one who had ever seen such a box before could

doubt that this was a pistol case. It was unlocked,
and Theodore lifted the lid.

One pistol lay in its place, neatly fitted into the
velvet lined receptacle. The place for the second
pistol was vacant.

Theodore took the Colt's revolver from his pocket
and fitted it into the place beside the other pistol.
It fitted exactly, and the two pistols were alike in all
respects  alike as to size and fashion, alike as to
the little silver plate upon the butt, and the initials,
*'T D."

Thomas Darcy ! Darcy was the name of Evelyn
Strangway's husband, and one of those pistols
which had belonged at some period to Evelyn
Strangway's husband had been found in the well in
the fruit garden, and the other in possession of
Ijovd. Cheritons protegee and pensioner, the humble
dependant at his gates, Mrs. Porter.

Theodore changed his mind as to his plan of
procedure. He did not send Mrs. Porter's letter to
Lord Cheriton by the groom as he had intended,
after he himself had been driven to Wareham. His
journey to London might be deferred now ; indeed,
in his present condition of mind, he was not the

man to interview the authorities of Scotland Yard.
He left Mrs. Porter's letter in its place beside the
pistol case, and wrote a hasty line to his kinsman at
Mrs. Porter's writing table, where all the materials
for correspondence were arranged ready to his hand.

The West Lodge, 8.15. Pray come to me hereat
once, if you can. I have made a terrible discovery.
There is a letter for you. Mrs. Porter has
gone to London."

He put these lines into an envelope, sealed it, and
then took it out to the groom, who was waiting
stolidly, neatly tickling the cob's ears now and again,
with an artistic circular movement of the lash,
which brought into play all the power and ease of
his wrist.

Drive back to the house with that note as fast
as you can," said Theodore, " and let his lordship
know that I am waiting for him here."

Thy love and hate are both unwise ones, lady."

"Well, Theodore, what is your discovery? '*
asked Lord Cheriton half-an-hour later, the two
men standing face to face in Mrs. Porter's sitting-room,
amidst the silence of the summer morning, a
gigantic hee buzzing in the brown velvet heart of
a tall sunflower, painfully audible to the younger
man's strained ears.

There is a letter, sir. You had better read that
before I say anything," answered Theodore.

It was years since he had called his cousin sir,
not since he had been a schoolboy, and had been
encouraged to open his mind upon politics or cricket,
over his single glass of claret, after dinner. On
those occasions a boyish respect for greatness had
prompted the ceremonious address ; to-day it came

to his lips involuntarily  as if a barrier of ice were
suddenly interposed between himself and the man
he had esteemed and admired for so many years of
his life.

Lord Cheriton held the letter in his hand unopened,
while he stood looking at the pistol case,
where both pistols occupied their places  one bright
and undamaged, the other rusted and spoilt, as to
outward appearance at least. He was ghastly pale,
but not much more so than he had looked yesterday
after he left Mrs. Porter's cottage.

That is my discovery," said Theodore, pointing
to the pistols. " I stopped short in my journey to
Scotland Yard when I found that case upon the
table here. I want to secure Juanita and her son
from the possibilities of an insatiable hatred  but I
don't want to bring trouble  or disgrace  upon you,
if I can help it. You have always been good to me.
Lord Cheriton. You have regarded the claims of
kindred. It would be base in me if I were to forget
that you are of my own blood  that you have a
right to my allegiance. Tell me, for God's sake, what
I am to do. Trust me, if you can. I know so much
already that it will be wisest and best for you to let

me know all  so that I may help you to find the
murderer, and to avoid any reopening of old
wounds."

I doubt if you or any one else can help me,
Theodore," said Lord Cheriton wearily, looking
straight before him through the open lattice and
across the little flower garden where the roses were
still in their plenitude of colour and perfume. *' I
doubt if all my worldly experience will enable me
to help myself even. There is a pass to which a
man may come In his life  not wholly by his own
fault  at which his case seems hopeless. He sees
himself suddenly brought to a dead stop, deep in
the mire of an impassable road, and with the words
No thoroughfare ' staring him in the face. I have
come to just that point."

Oh, but there is always an issue from every
difficulty for a man of courage and resolution," said
Theodore. *' I know you are not a man to be easily
broken down by Fate. I am half in the light and
half in the dark. It must have been the owner of
that pistol who killed Godfrey Carmichael  but how
came the case and the fellow-pistol into Mrs. Porter's
possession ? Alas she that man's accomplice ?

VOL. III. M

And who was lie, and what was he, that she should
be associated with him ? "

"You believe that it was a man who fired that
pistol ? "

'' Most assuredly. I believe it was the man whose
wife lived for many years at Myrtle Cottage, Camberwell
Grove ; the man who called upon a house-agent
at Camberwell to make inquiries about his
wife, . and who called himself by the name she bore
in the neighbourhood  the name of Danvers.
Danvers may have been only an alias for Darcy, and
in that case the man who called upon the agent was
the husband of Evelyn Strangway, and the woman
who lived for so many years in the seclusion of
Myrtle Cottage was old Squire Strangway' s only
daughter, and Captain Darcy's runaway wife."

'rand you think Tom Darcy murdered my son-in-law
? " asked Lord Cheriton, with a ghastly smile.

"I do."

"And what do you suppose to have been the
motive of that murder ? "

Revenge  revenge upon the man who tempted
his wife away from him."

The cur who ill-used and neglected his wife 

whose conduct drove her from her wretched home,
and justified her abandonment of him  was never
man enough to conceive such a revenge, or to hate
with such a hatred. However, in this case we need
not enter upon the question of motive. There is
one reason why Tom Darcy cannot be suspected of
any part in Sir Godfrey's murder. He died nine
years ago, and was buried at my expense in Wormwood
Cemetery."

Great God ! then who could have fired that
pistol?"

The answer to that question is most likely
here," replied Lord Cheriton quietly, as he tore open
the envelope of Mrs. Porter's letter.

The letter was brief but comprehensive, and all-sufficing.


You know now who killed your cherished
daughter's husband. If she is like me she will
carry her sorrow to the grave. If she is like me
all her days will be darkened by cruel memories.
Your broken promise blighted my life. I have
blighted her life  an eye for an eye. I told you
three-and-twenty years ago that a day would come

M 2

when you would be sorry for having abandoned me.
I think that day has come.

*' Evelyn Darcy."

Lord Cheriton handed the letter to his kinsman
without a word.

Since you know so much of my history you
may as well know all," he said; "so know the
thorny pillow which a man makes for himself when
he sacrifices the best years of his life to an illicit
love."

Theodore read those ghastly lines in silence. The
signature told all.

What in Heaven's name brought Evelyn
Strangway to be a housekeeper at the entrance of
the house where she was born ? " he asked, at last.
*' How could you permit such a life-long humiliation
? "

It was her own desire  it was at her insistance
I allowed her to come here. I opposed her
fancy with all my power of argument, with all the
strength of opposition. I offered to provide her
with a home in town or country  at home or abroad
near at hand or at the Antipodes. I offered to

settle four hundred a year upon her  to sink capital
to that amount  to make her future and that of 
our child  secure against the chances of fate."

*' Your child  Mercy I " exclaimed Theodore.

Yes, Mercy. My daughter and hers. You
understand now why she refused my help. She
would take nothing from her father. There was a
like perversity in mother and daughter, a determination
to make me drink the cup of remorse to the
dregs. Oh, Theodore, it is a long and shameful
story. To you  for the first time in my life  to you
only among mankind these lips have spoken of it.
I have kept my secret. I have brooded upon it in
the slow hours of many and many a wakeful night.
I have never forgotten  I have not been allowed to
forget. If time could have erased or softened that
bitter memory under other conditions I know
not ; but for me the case was hopeless. My victim
was there, at my gates, a perpetual memento of my
folly and my wrong-doing."

Strange that a woman of refinement and
education should elect to fill so degrading a position
! "

Perhaps only a refined and highly educated

woman could have devised so refined a punishment.
Let me live near you,' she pleaded ; * let me live
at the gate of the park I loved so well when I was
a child  let me see you pass sometimes  open the
gate for you and just see you go by  without a word,
without a look even upon your part. It will be some
consolation for me in my lonely, loveless life. I shall
know that at least lam iK)t forgotten.' Forgotten ?
as if it had been possible for me to forget, in
the happiest circumstances, even if she had made
for herself a home at the farthest extremity of
Europe, or in the remotest of our colonies. As it
was, her presence embittered the place I loved  the
great reward and aim of my life. Her shadow fell
across my young wife's pathway  her influence
darkened all my days."

He began to pace up and down the little room
with a feverish air. He seemed to find a sort of
relief in talking of this burden which he had borne
so long in secret  borne with a smile upon his lips,
suffering that silent agony which strong men have
borne again and again in the history of mankind,
carrying their silent punishment upon them till the
grave revealed the hidden canker, and laid bare the

festering wound wliicli had rankled unsuspected by
the world.

She was cruelly treated by her husband, Theodore.
A young and beautiful woman, married to a
profligate and a sot. It had been a love-match, as
the world calls it  that is to say, a marriage brought
about by a schoolgirl's impatience to break her
bonds, and a woman's first delight in hearing herself
called beautiful. She had flung herself away
upon a handsome reprobate ; and three or four years
after marriage she found herself alone and neglected
in a shabby lodging in one of the sublimest streets
off the Strand. I can see the wretched rooms she
lived in, to-day, as I stand here  the lodging-house
furniture, the dingy curtains darkening the dirty
windows looking into the dirty street. "What a
home for youth and beauty I "

He paused, with an impatient sigh, took another
turn across the narrow space, and then resumed :

Our acquaintance began by accident  under an
umbrella. I met them together one night, husband
and wife, leaving the little Strand theatre in the
rain. I heard him tell her that it was not worth
while to take a cab, they were so near home ; and

something in her proud, handsome face and her
contemptuous way of replying to him caught my
attention and interested me in her. I offered my
umbrella, and we all three walked to Essex Street
together. Just in that fortuitous way began the
alliance which was to give its colour to all my
life. The husband cultivated my acquaintance 
was glad to meet me at my club  and dined with
me as often as I cared to ask him. We used to goto
Essex Street after dining together, and finish the
evening with her, and so by degrees I came to know
all about her  that she was the only daughter of the
owner of Cheriton Chase ; that she was very handsome,
and very clever, though only half-educated ; that
she had offended her father by her marriage, and that
she had not brought her husband a penny ; that he
neglected her, and that he drank ; and that she was
miserable. I came to know this very soon ; I came
very soon to love her. She was the first woman I
had ever cared for, and I loved her passionately."

He took another turn, and sighed again, regretfully,
despairingly, as one who looks back upon the
pallid ghost of a love that has long been dead.

*' It began with pity. I was so sorry for her, poor

soul, her wasted life, lier slighted beauty. God
knows that for a long time I had no thought of sin.
Gradually the yearning to see more of her, to bring
some brightness and pleasure into her life, became
too strong for prudence, and I persuaded her to
meet me unknown to her husband. We planned
little excursions, innocent enough in themselves, a
morning drive and a modest luncheon at Richmond,
or Greenwich, or Jack Straw's Castle, a trip to
Hampton Court or Windsor by boat or rail. She
had hardly any acquaintances in London, and there
was little fear of her being recognized. We went to
a theatre together now and then, and sat in a dark
stage box, happy, talking of an impossible future in
the intervals of the performance. We never said as
much, but I think we had both a vague idea that
Providence would help us  that her husband would
die young, and leave us free to be happy together.
Yes, we were very fond of each other, very single-hearted
in those days. She was only two-and-twenty,
remember, and I was still a young man."

Another pause, another sigh, and a look across
the roses, as if across the long lapse of years to an
unforgotten past.

'' Heaven knows how long we might have gone on
in this way, without sin, if not without treachery to
the husband, who cared so little for his wife that it
seemed scarcely dishonourable to deceive him. Our
fate was precipitated by circumstances. Darcy surprised
a little note of mine, asking Evelyn to meet
me at a theatre. He attacked his wife brutally,
refused to believe anything except the worst. He
called her by names that were new and hideous to
her ear, and her soul rose up in arms against him.
She defied him, ran out of the house, took a cab,
and came to my chambers in the foggy November
evening. She came to me helpless, friendless, with
no one in this wide world to love her or to protect
her, except me. This was the turning-point. Of
course she could not stay there to be seen by my
clerk and my laundress. I took her to Salisbury that
night, and we spent a fortnight moving from village
to village along the south coast of Devonshire. My
hope was that Darcy would apply for a divorce, and
that in less than a year I might make the woman I
loved my wife. I rejoiced in the thought of his
obscurity and hers. The record of the case would
pass unnoticed in the papers, and years hence, when

I should have made a position at the Bar, nobody
need know that the wife I loved and honoured was
once the runaway wife of another man. I had
argued without allowing for the malignity of a cur.
Darcy wrote his wife one of the most diabolical
letters that ever was penned by man ; he wreaked
his venom upon her  upon her, the weaker sinner ;
he called her by all the vile epithets in his copious
vocabulary, and he told her that she should never
have the right to the name of an honest woman, for
that he would sooner hang himself than divorce her.
And so she was to drag her chain for the rest of his
days ; and so she was to pay the bitter price of having
trusted her young life to a low-bred scoundrel."

"Hard luck for both of you," said Theodore.

"Yes, it was indeed hard luck. If you could
know how truly and entirely I loved her in those
days  how completely happy we should have been
in each other's society, but for the embittering consciousness
of our false position. Cut off by his
malevolence from escape by divorce, we naturally
hoped for a day when we should be released by his
death. His habits were not those which conduce to
length of years.

'* We talked of the future  we had our plans and
dreams about that life which was to be ours in after
days, when I should be making a large income, and
when she would be really my wife. With that hope
before her she was content to live in the strictest
seclusion, to economize in every detail of our existence,
to know no pleasure except that of my society.
Never did a handsome woman resign herself to a
duller or more unselfish existence  and yet I believe
for the first few years she was happy. We were
both happy  and we were full of hope.

I remember the day she first suggested to me
that I should buy Cheriton Chase when it came into
the market. I was beginning to be employed in
important cases, and to get big fees marked upon
my briefs, and I had taken silk. I had made my
name, and I was saving money. Yet the suggestion
that I should buy a large estate was too wild for
any one but a woman to have made. From that
hour, however, it was Evelyn's idee fixe. She had
a passionate love for her birthplace, an overweening
pride in her race and name. She urged me to accumulate
money  the estate would be sacrificed at half
its value, perhaps,  would go for an old song. She

became rigidly economical, would hardly allow herself
a new gown, and her keenest delight was in the
deposit notes I brought her, as my money accumulated
at the Union Bank. She had no idea of
investments, or interest for my accumulations. Her
notions about money were a child's notions  the
idea of saving a large sum to buy the desire of
her heart ; and the desire of her heart was Cheriton
Chase.

*' God knows I was honest and earnest enough in
those days. I meant to buy that estate, for her
sake, if it was possible to be done. I meant to
marry her directly she was free to become my wife.
My fidelity had not wavered after a union of ten
years and more  but Darcy was very far from dying.
He had hunted out his wife in her quiet retreat,
had threatened and annoyed her, and I had been
obliged to buy him off by paying his passage to
Canada  where he had been quartered with his
regiment years before, and which he pretended
would open a new field for him. Our case, sofar
as he was concerned, seemed hopeless, and I
was beginning to feel the darkness of the outlook,
when I made Maria Morales' acquaintance.

*' It was the old, old story, Theodore. God
forbid you should ever go through that hackneyed
experience. Just as the old chain was beginning to
drag heavily, a new face appeared upon my pathway
a girlish face, bright with promise and hope. I
saw the opportunity of a union which would smooth
my way to a great position  crown the edifice of my
fortune, give me a wife of whom I might be proud.
Could I ever have been proud of the woman who
had sacrificed her good name for my sake ? I
was bound to her by every consideration of honour
and duty. But there was the fatal stain across both,
our lives. I could not take her into society without
the fear of hearing malignant whispers as we
passed. However well these social secrets may be
kept, there is always some enemy to hunt them out,
and the antecedents of James Dalbrook's wife would
have been public property.

And here was a beautiful and innocent girl who
loved me well enough to accept me as her husband
although I was twenty years her senior, loved me
with that youthful upward-looking love which is of
all sentiments the most attractive to a man who
 has lived a hard work-a-day life in a hard work-a-day

world. To spend an hour with Maria was to feel a
Sabbath peacefulness which solaced and refreshed
my soul. I felt ten years younger when I was with
her than I felt in my own  home."

He stopped, with a heart-broken sigh.

Oh, Theodore, beware of such burdens as that
which I laid upon my shoulders ; beware of such a
chain as I wound about my steps. What a dastard
a man feels himself when his love begins to cool for
the woman who cast her life upon one chance  who
leans upon him as the beginning and end of her
existence. I have walked up and down the quiet
pathway before Myrtle Cottage for an hour at a
stretch, dreading to go in, lest she should read my
treason in my face. The break came at last  suddenly.
I paltered with my fate for a long time. I
carried on a kind of Platonic flirtation with Maria
Morales, taking monstrous pains to let her know
that I never meant to go beyond Platonic  reminding
her of the difference of our ages, and of my
almost paternal regard  the vain subterfuge of a
self-deluded man. One moment of impulse swept
away all barriers, and I left Onslow Square Maria's
engaged husband. Her father's generosity precipitated

matters. Squire Strangway had been dead
nearly a year, and the estate was in the hands of
the mortgagee, who had been trying to sell it for
some time. My future father-in-law was eager for
the purchase directly I suggested it to him, and my
wife's dowry afforded me the means of realizing
Evelyn's long-cherished dream."

Cruel for her, poor creature."

*' Cruel  brutal  diabolical ! I felt the blackness
of my treason, and jet it had been brought about
by circumstances rather than by any deliberate act
of mine. I had to go to the woman who still loved
me, and still trusted me, and tell her what I was
going to do. I had to do this, and I did it  byword
of mouth  face to face  not resorting to the
coward's expedient of pen and ink. God help me,
the memory of that scene is with me now. It was
too terrible for words ; but after the storm came a
calm, and a week later I went across to Boulogne
with her, and saw her comfortably established thereat
a private hotel, where she was to remain as long
as she liked, while she made up her mind as to her
future residence. The furniture was sent to the
Pantechnicon. The home was broken up for ever'*

** And the daughter, where was she ? "

Lord Cheriton answered with a smile of infinite
bitterness.

The daughter had troubled us very little.
Evelyn was not an exacting mother. The child's
existence was a burden to her  rendered hateful by
the stigma upon her birth, which the mother could
not forget. Mercy's infancy was spent in a Buckinghamshire
village, in the cottage of her foster-mother.
Mother and daughter never lived under
the same roof till they came here together, when
Mercy was seven years old."

"Yet, according to village tradition, Mrs. Porter
was passionately fond of her daughter, and brokenhearted
at her loss."

'' Tillage tradition often lies. I do not believe
that Evelyn ever loved her child. She bitterly felt
the circumstances of her birth  she bitterly resented
her unhappy fate ; but I believe it was her pride,
her deep sense of wrong done to herself, which
tortured her rather than her love for her only child.
She is a strange woman, Theodore  a woman who
could do that deed  a woman who could write that
letter. Your friend has fathomed her unhappy

VOL. III. N

secret. She was a madwoman when she fired
that. shot. She was mad when she penned that
letter. And now, Theodore, I have trusted you
as I have never before trusted mortal man. I have
ripped open an old wound. You know all, and you
see what lies before me. I have to find that woman
and to save her from the consequences of her crime,
and to save my daughter and my grandson from the
hazards of a madwoman's malignity. You can help
me, Theodore, if you can keep a cool, clear brain,
and do just what I ask you to do, and no more."

He put aside his emotion with one stupendous
effort, and became a man of iron, cool, resolute,
unflinching.

*'I will obey jou implicitly," said Theodore.

He had been completely won by his kinsman's
candour. Had James Dalbrook told him anything
less than the truth he would have despised him.
As it was, he felt that he could still respect him,
in spite of that fatal error, which had brought such
deadly retribution.

It is early yet," said Lord Cheriton, looking at
his watch, and from that to the neat little clock on
the mantelpiece, where the hands pointed to twenty

minutes past ne. " The dog-cart is waiting outside.
Do you drive to the Priory and put yourself
on guard there till  till that unhappy woman has
been traced. You can tell Juanita that I have sent
you there  that I have heard of dangerous characters
being about, and that I am afraid of her being
in the house with only servants. My wife shall
follow you later, and can stay at the Priory while I
am away from home, which I must be, perhaps, for
some time. I have to find her, Theodore."

Have you any idea where she may be gone ? "

For the moment, none. She may have made
her way to the nearest river and thrown herself in.
Living or dead, I have to find her. That is my
business. And when I have found her I have to
get her put away out of the reach of the law. TJiat
is my business."

'' God help you to carry it through," said Theodore.
" I shall stay at the Priory till I hear from
you. Be so kind as to ask Lady Cheriton to brings
my portmanteau and dressing-bag in her carriage
this afternoon. I may tell Juanita that her mother
is coming to-day, may I not ? "

Decidedly ! Good-bye. God bless you, Then

2

close. I know that I may rely upon your holding
your tongue. I know I can rely upon your active
help if I should need you."

And so with a cordial grasp of hands they parted,
Theodore to take his seat in the dog-cart, and drive
towards the Priory to offer himself to his cousin asher
guest for an indefinite period. It was a curious
position in which he found himself; but the delight
of being in Juanita's society, of being in sometime
her protector, was a counterbalance to the embarrassing
conditions under which he was to approach
her.

Love's reason's without reason."

The col) was all the fresher for the impatience
which he had suffered in standing for nearly an hour
in the lane, and he bowled the dogcart along the
level roads at a tremendous pace. Theodore
arrived at the Priory before eleven, and found
Juanita sitting on the lawn with her baby in her
lap, and the dog Styx at her side. His heart
leapt with gladness at the sight of her sitting
there, safe and happy, in the morning sunshine,
for his morbid imagination had been at work as he
drove along, and he had been haunted by hideous
visions of some swift and bloody act which might
be done by the fugitive madwoman before he could
reach the Priory. What deed might not be done
by a woman in the state of mind which that
woman must have been in when she left the evidence
and the confession of her crime upon the table and

fled out of her house in the early morning ? A
silent thanksgiving went up from his heart to his
God as he saw Juanita sitting in the sunshine,
smiling at him, holding out her hand to him in
surprised welcome. She was safe, and it was his
business to guard her against that deadly enemy.
He knew now whence the danger was to come 
whose the hand he had to fear. It was no longer a
nameless enemy, an inscrutable peril from which
he had to defend her.

*' How early you are, Theodore. Everybody is
well, I hope  there is nothing wrong at home ? "

No. Every one is well. Your father is going
to London for a few days, and your mother is
coming to stay with you during his absence, and I
come to throw myself on your hospitality while she
is here. His lordship has heard of some suspicious
characters in your neighbourhood, and has taken it
into his head that it will be well for you to have meas
your guest until your brothers-in-law come to
you for the shooting. I hope you won't mind
having me, Juanita ? "

"Mind, no; I am delighted to have you, and
my mother, too. I was beginning to feel rather

lonely, and bad half decided on carrying baby off to
Swanage. Isn't be a fortunate boy to have two
doating grandmothers ? " She checked herself with
a sudden sigh, remembering in vrhat respect the
richly-dowered infant was so much poorer than
other babies. 'eyes, darling," she murmured,
bending over the sleeping face, rosy amidst its
lace and ribbons as it nestled against her arm.
** Yes, there is plenty of love for you upon earth,
my fatherless one ; and, who knows, perhaps his
love is watching over you in heaven."

After this maternal interlude she remembered
the obligations of hospitality.

Have you breakfasted, Theodore ? You must
bave left Cheriton very early."

Theodore did not tell her how early, but he confessed
to having taken only a cup of tea.

Then I will order some breakfast out here for
you. It is such a perfect morning. Baby and I
will stay with you while you take your breakfast."

She called the nurse, who was close by, and gave
her orders, and presently the gipsy table was brought
out, and a cosy breakfast was arranged upon the
shining damask, and Theodore was having his

coffee poured out for him by the loveliest hands he
had ever seen, while the nurse paraded up and
down the lawn with the newly-awakened baby.

*' I cannot understand my father taking an alarm
of that kind," Juanita said, presently, after a
thoughtful silence. " It is so unlike him. As if any
harm could come to me from tramps or gipsies, or
even professional burglars, with half a dozen menservants
in the house, and all my jewels safe at the
Bank. Theodore, does it mean anything?" she
asked, suddenly. "Does it mean that my father
has found out something about the murder ? "

He was silent, painfully embarrassed by this
home question. To answer it would be to break
faith with Lord Cheriton ; to refuse to answer was
in some manner to break his promise to Juanita.

I must ask you to let me leave that question
unanswered for a few days," he said. *' Whatever
discovery has been made it is your father's
discovery, and not mine. His lips alone can tell it
to you."

*' You know who murdered my husband ? "

*' No, Juanita, I know nothing. The light weare
following may be a false one."

He remembered how many lying confessions of
crime bad been made by lunacy since the history
of crime began  how poor distraught creatures
who would not have killed a worm had taken upon
themselves the burden of notorious assassinations,
and had put the police to the trouble of proving
them self-accusing perjurers. Might not Mrs.
Porter be such an one as these ?

** Ah ! but you are following some new light 
you are on the track of his murderer ? "

*' I think we are. But you must be patient,
Juanita. You must wait till your father may choose
to speak. The business is out of my hands now,
and has passed into his."

And he is going to London to-day, you say  he
is going upon that business ? "

I have said too much already, Juanita. I
entreat you to ask me no more."

She gave an impatient sigh, and turned from her
cousin to the dog, as if he were the more interesting
companion of the two.

Well, I suppose I must be content to wait,"
she said ; " but if you knew what I have suffered 
what I shall suffer till that mystery is solved  von

would not wonder if I feel angry at being kept in
the dark. Has your friend gone back to London ? "

** Yes ; but he is coming again before my holiday
is over. You like him, I know, Juanita," he
added, looking at her somewhat earnestly.

"Yes, I like him," she answered, carelessly, but
with a faint blush. " I suppose most people like
him, do they not ? He is so bright and clever."

** I am very glad you like him. He is the most
valued friend I have  indeed, I might almost say
he is the only friend I made for myself at the
University. I made plenty of acquaintances, but
very few I cared to meet in after-life. Ramsay was
like a brother. It would have been a real grief tome
if our friendship had not lasted."

He is ambitious, is he not ? "

Very ambitious."

"And proud?"

Very proud ; but it is a noble pride  the pride
that keeps a man straight in all his doings  the
pride that prefers bread and cheese in a garret to
turtle and venison at a parvenu's table. He is a
splendid fellow, Nita, and I am proud of his friendships'*


'' Is he very busy, that he should be so determined
to leave Dorchester ? "

'' Yes; he is full of work always. I thought he
might have been content to take two or three weeks'
quiet reading in our sleepy old town, but he wanted
to get back to the hospital. He will come back fora
day or two when the whim seizes him. He has
always been erratic in his pleasures, but steady asa
rock in his work."

The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood."

Lord Cheeiton put the pistol-case under his
arm and left the cottage. The case was covered by
his loose summer overcoat, and anybody meeting
him in the Park might have supposed that he was
carrying a book, or might have failed to observe that
he was carrying anything whatever. As it happened
he met nobody between the West Gate and
the house. He went in at the open window of the
library, locked the pistol case in one of the capacious
drawers of the large writing-table  drawers
which contained many of his most important documents,
and which were provided with the safest
lever locks.

When this was done he went to his wife's
morning-room, where she was generally to be found

at this hour, her light breakfast finished, and her
newspaper-reading or letter writing begun.

Where have you been so early, James ? " she
asked, looking up at him with an affectionate smile.
*' I was surprised to hear you had gone out before
breakfast."

He looked at her in silence for a few moments 
lost in thought. The beautiful and gracious face
turned towards him in gentle inquiry had never
frowned upon him in all their years of wedded life.
Never had that tranquil affection failed him. There
had been no dramatic passion in their love, no
fierce alternations of despair and bliss  no doubts,
no jealousies. His girlish wife had given herself
to him in implicit trustfulness, fond of him, and
proud of him, believing in him with a faith second
only to her faith in God. For three-and-twenty
years of cloudless wedded life she had made his
days happy. Never in all those years had she
given him reason for one hour of doubt or trouble.
She had been his loving and loyal helpmate, sharing
his hopes and his ambitions, caring for the
people he cared for, respecting even his prejudices,
shaping her life in all things to please him.

Great heaven ! what a contrast with that other
woman, whose fiery and exacting love had made
his life subordinate to hers  whose jealousy had
claimed the total surrender of all other ties, of all
other pleasures, had cut him off from all the
advantages of society, had deprived him of the
power to make friends among his fellow-men, had
kept him as her bond-slave, accepting nothing less
than a complete isolation from all that men hold
best in life.

He looked at his wife's calm beauty  where
scarce a line upon the ivory-white forehead marked
the progress of years  the soft, gazelle-like eyes
lifted so meekly to meet his own. He compared
this placid face with that other face, handsome,
too, after its fashion  long after the bloom of
youth had gone  but marked in every feature with
the traces of a nervous temperament, a fiery temper,
the face of a woman in whose character there were
none of the elements of domestic happiness  orin
a word, the face of a Strangway, the daughter
of a perverse and unhappy race, from whose line
no life of happiness and well-doing had arisen within
the memory of man.

My dear Maria, I was wrong in not leaving a
message. I was sent for to Mrs. Porter's cottage.
She has gone away in rather a mysterious manner."

*' Gone away ! "

*' Yes. That in itself is rather astonishing, you
know ; but there was something so strange in her
manner of leaving that I feel it my duty to look
after her. I shall go up to town by the mid-day
train. I have other business which may keep mein
London for a few days, till the shooting begins,
perhaps. I have sent Theodore to the Priory to tell
Juanita that you are going to her this afternoon, and
that you will stay with her till I come back."

** That is disposing of me rather as if I were a
chattel," said his wife, smiling.

I knew you would be glad of a few days' quiet
baby-worship at the Priory, and I knew this house
would be dull for you without any visitors."

Yes, there is always a gloom upon the house
when you are away  a much deeper gloom since
last summer. No sooner am I alone than I begin
to think of that dreadful night when my poor girl
saw her murdered husband lying at her feet. Yes,
James, you are right in sending me away. I shall

be happy at the Priory with my darling  and she
can never again be happy with me in this house."

Lord Cheriton breakfasted in his wife's room it
was only an apology for breakfast, for he was too
agitated to eat ; but he refreshed himself with a cup
of strong tea, and he enjoyed the restfulness of his
wife's companionship while he sat there waiting for
the carriage which was to take him to Wareham.

What makes you so uneasy about Mrs. Porter ?"
Lady Cheriton asked presently.

*' The suddenness and strangeness of her departure,
in the first place. It would have been only natural
she should have communicated with you or me before
she left. And, in the second place, I have been
made uneasy by an observation of Mr. Kamsay's.
He has conceived the opinion that Mrs. Porter is
not altogether right in her mind  that there is a
strain of madness."

** Oh, James, that would be dreadful ! "

** Yes, it would be dreadful to think of her wandering
about alone. The very fact that she has hardly
left that cottage for the last twenty years, except to
go to church, would make her nervous and helpless
among strangers and in a strange town. She would

hardly be able to take care of herself, perhaps  and
if, in addition to this, her mind is not quite

right "

"Oh, poor thing! It is terrible to think of
it. And 3-ou do not even know where she has
gone ? "

'* She told the servant she was going to
London. God knows whether that is true or
false. She took no luggage, not even a handbag."


*' She may have gone to her daughter."
To Mercy ? Yes, that is an idea. It never
occurred to me. She has been so cold and hard
about her daughter in all these years  and
yet it may be so. She may have relented at
last."

A servant announced the carriage. His Lordship's
portmanteau had been got in, and all was
ready.

Good-bye, Maria. I have no time to lose, as I
have inquiries to make and telegrams to dispatch at
the station."

You will stay in Victoria Street, of course *? "
'eyes. I shall telegraph to Mrs. Begby. lam

VOL. III. o

taking Wilson ; I shall be very well taken care of,
be sure, clearest."

He kissed her and hurried away. He sighed ashe
left that atmosphere of perfect peace  sighed
again as he thought of the business that lay before
him. He had to find her  this murderess  he had
to prove that she was mad  if it were possible  and
to put her away for the rest of her days in some
safe retreat, secure from the hazard of discovery 
a hard and bitter task for the man who had once
loved her, and whose love had been her destruction.


He made his inquiries of the station-master. Yes,
Mrs. Porter had left by the early train. She had
taken a second-class ticket for Waterloo.

Lord Cheriton telegraphed to Miss Marian Gray,
at 69, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth 

** If your mother is with you when you receive
this I beg you to detain her till I come.

Cheriton."
His wife's suggestion seemed to him like inspiration.

Where else could that desolate woman seek
for a shelter but under the roof which sheltered
her only child ? She was utterly friendless in
London and elsewhere  unless, indeed, her old
governess Sarah Newton could be counted as a
friend.

The Weymouth up train steamed in, and he took
his seat in the corner of a first-class compartment,
where he was tolerably secure of being left to himself
for the whole of the journey, guards and porters
conspiring to protect his seclusion, albeit he
had not taken the trouble to engage a compartment.
His greatness was known all along the
line.

He had ample leisure for thought during that
three hours' journey, leisure to live over again that
life of long ago which had been brought so vividly
back to his memory by the events of to-day. He
had made it his business to forget that past life, sofar
as forgetfulness was possible, with that living
reminder for ever at his gate. Habit had even reconciled
him to the presence of Mrs. Porter at the
West Lodge. Her supreme quietude had argued her
contentment. Never by so much as one imprudent



word, or one equivocal look, had she aroused his
wife's doubts as to her past relations with her
employer. She had been accepted by all the little
world of Cheriton, she had behaved in the most exemplary
manner ; and although he had never driven
in at the west gate, and seen her standing there in
her attitude of stern humility, without a pang of
remorse and a stinging sense of shame, yet that
sharp moment of pain being past, he was able to
submit to her existence as the one last forfeit he had
to pay for his sin. And now he knew that the
statue-like calm of her face, as she had looked up at
him in the clear light, under the branching beeches,
had been only the mask of hidden fires  that
through all those years in which she had seemed the
image of quiet resignation, of submission to a
mournful fate, she had been garnering up her
vengeance to wreak it upon the offender in his most
unguarded hour, piercing the breast of the father
through the innocent heart of the child. He knew
now that hatred had been for ever at his doors, that
angry pride had watched his going in and coming
out, under the guise of humility  that by day and
by night hideous thoughts had been busy in that

hyper-active brain, such thoughts as point the way
to madness and to crime.

Ashen he had made up his mind to break his
promise to Evelyn Darcy, and to marry another
woinan, fifteen jeavs her junior, he had told himself
that the wrench once made, the link once sundered,
all would be over. She would submit as other
women have submitted to the common end of such
ties. She could not deem herself more unfortunate
than those other women had been, since his attachment
had endured far longer than the average span
of illicit loves. He had been patient and faithful
and unselfish in his devotion for more than a decade.
He would have gone on waiting perhaps had there
been a ray of hope ; but Tom Darcy had shown a
malignant persistency in keeping alive ; and even
were Tom Darcy dead how bitter a thing it would befor
the fashionable Queen's Counsel to enter society
with a wife of damaged character. In the old days
of hopefulness and fond love they had told each
other that the stain upon the past need never be
known in that brilliant future to which they both
looked forward ; but now he told himself that despite
their secluded life the facts of that past would ooze

oat. People would insist upon finding out who Mr.
Dalbrook's wife was. It would not be enough to
say, *' She is there  handsome, clever, and a lady."
Society would peer and pry into the background of
her life. Whose daughter was she ? Had she been
married before? And in that case who was her
husband ? Where had she lived before her recent
marriage ? Had she spent her earlier years in the
Colonies or on the Continent, or how was it that
society had seen nothing of her ?

Those inevitable questions would have made his
life a burden and her life an agony, James Dalbrook
told himself ; even had Darcy been so complaisant
as to die and leave them free to rehabilitate their
position by marriage ; but Darcy had shown no disposition
towards dying, and now here was a lovely
girl with a fortune willing to marry him  a girl to
whom his heart had gone out, despite his conscientious
endeavour to be faithful to that old attachment.


To-day in his agony of remorse and apprehension,
he could recall the scene of their severance as well
as if it had happened yesterday.

He had gone home in the chill March twilight,

in that depressing season when the pale spring
flowers, daffodils, primroses, and narcissus are fighting
their ineffectual battle with the cutting east wind,
when the sparrows have eaten the hearts of all the
crocuses, and the scanty grass in suburban gardens
is white with dust, when the too-early lighted lamps
have a sickly look in the windy streets, and the
neglected fires in suburban drawing-rooms are more
dismal than fireless hearths.

Camberwell Grove was not at its best in this
bleak March season. The time had been when the
long narrow garden at Myrtle Cottage was carefully
kept, and when Evelyn had taken a pride in the old-fashioned
flower-borders and the blossoming creepers
upon the verandah, but for the last two or three
years she had been careless and indifferent, and
one jobbing gardener having left the neighbourhood
she had taken no pains to get another in his place ;
nor had she done any of that weeding and watering
and pruning, which had at one time helped to
shorten the long light evenings. A weariness of all
things had come upon her, tired out with waiting for
brighter days.

He had refused Don Jose's pressing invitation to

dine in Onslow Square. He had turned his baclv
upon the warm brightness of newly-furnished
drawing-rooms, an atmosphere of hot-house flowers,
great rush baskets of tulips, hyacinths and narcissus,
low vases of lilies of the valley and Parma violets ;
and amidst all this brightness and colour the
beautiful Spanish girl, with her pale, clear complexion
and soft black eyes. He had left his
newly-betrothed wife reluctant to let him go, in
order to face the most painful crisis that can
occur in any man's life; in order to tell the
woman who had loved and trusted him that
love was at an end between them ; that the
bond was broken, and his promise of no account.


*' I expected you earlier, James," she said, opening
the door to him.

It was rarely that the door was opened by a
servant when he went home. She was always
waiting for his knock.

** Yes, it is late, I know. I have been detained.
I have lingered a little on the way  I walked from
the West End."

*what, all the way? By the Walworth

Road, that low neighbourhood you dislike so
much ? "

I did not care where I walked, Evelyn. I
was too miserable to think about my surroundings."


"Miserable ! " she asked, looking at him searchingly,
and growing pale as she looked, as if the
pallor of his face reflected itself in hers, 'what
should make you miserable ? "

They were standing in the drawing-room, where
the moderator-lamp upon the table shone bright and
clear upon his troubled face.

You have lost your money, James  you have
speculated  you won't be able to buy Cheriton
Chase," she said, breathlessly.

Nonsense, Evelyn. Don't you know that you
have the deposit notes for every pound I ever
saved locked up in your desk."

Ah, but you might speculate  you may have
ruined yourself, all the same."

*' I have not ruined myself that way, Evelyn.
Oh ! for God's sake forgive me, pity me if you
can. I have engaged myself to a girl who loves
me, though I am twenty years her senior; a

girl who is proud of me and believes in me.
This engagement means a new and happy life
for me, and may mean release for you  who
knows? We have neither of us been happy
lately. I think we have both felt that the end
must come."

She laid her hand upon his breast, holding the
lapel of his coat tightly with her thin white fingers,
as if she would pin him there for ever, looking
straight into his eyes, with her own eyes dilated and
flaming.

You are a coward and a traitor ! " she said, between
her clenched teeth. " You are lying, and
you know you are lying. The tie has grown weaker
for you, perhaps  not for me. For me every year
has strengthened it  for me every hope I have has
pointed to one future  the future in which I am to
be your wife. You know what my husband's habits
are  you know what his life is worth as compared
with yours. You know that we must be near the
end of our probation, that suddenly, without an
hour's warning, we may hear of his death, and you
will be free to give me the name and place I have
earned by ten years' fidelity, and patience, and self-denial.

You know this, and that my Hfe is bound
up in yours ; that I cannot exist without you except
as the most miserable of women ; that I have nota
friend in the world, not a hope in the world, not
an ambition in the world but you ; and you look
me in the face with those cold, cruel eyes, and
tell me you have engaged yourself to a girl
twenty years your junior, that j'ou are going to
cast me off  me, your wife of ten years  more
than wife in devotion, more than wife in self-sacrifice
"

God knows the sacrifice was mutual, Evelyn.
If there has been surrender on your side there has
been surrender on mine. I have turned my back
upon society just at the time when it would have
been most enjoyable and most valuable. But I
won't even try to excuse myself. I have acted very
badly  I deserve the worst you can say of me. I
thought I was sure of myself, I thought I was rock ;
but the hour of temptation came, and I was not
strong enough to withstand it. Be generous, Evelyn.
Clasp hands and forgive me. Wherever I am and
whatever I do your welfare shall be my first, most
sacred care. The money I have saved shall be

invested for your benefit  shall be secured to jour
use and our daughter's after you."

"Money, benefit," she cried, wildly. ** How
dare you talk to me of money ? How dare you put
my wrongs in the balance against your sordid money ?
Do you think money can help me to forget you  or
to hate myself less than I do for having loved and
trusted you ? "

And then followed a paroxysm of passionate
despair at the memory of which, after all the intervening
sears of peace and prosperity, wedded love
and deadened conscience, his blood ran cold. He
found himself face to face with a woman's frenzy,
impotent to comfort or to tranquillize her. There
was a moment when he had to exert brute force
to prevent her from dashing her brains out against
the wall.

All through that long, hideous night he watched
by her, and pleaded with her, and guarded her from
her own violence. At one time he was on his knees
before her, offering to give up the desire of his
heart, to break his solemn engagement of a few
hours old, and to remain true to her till the end of
time ; but she spurned his offered sacrifice.

What, now that I know j'ou love another woman ?
Yhat, keep you by my side, while I know your
heart is elsewhere ? What, have you mine by the
strength of a chain, like a galley-slave linked to his
gaol-companion, knowing that you hate me ? Not
for worlds  not to be a duchess. No, no, no ! The
wrong is done  the wrong was in withdrawing your
love. There is no such thing as faithfulness from
you to me. All is over."

He argued against himself  implored her to
accept his sacrifice.

' I would do anything in this world, pay any
price, rather than see such despair as I have seen
to-night," he said, standing in the cold, grey dawn,
haggard and aged by the long night of agony, beside
the bed where that convulsed form lay writhing,
with tear-disfigured face, lips wounded and bloodstained,
strained eye-balls, and dishevelled hair.
She was adamant against his pleading.
'' You cannot give me back my trust in you. I
am not the coarse, common creature you think me.
I do not want to keep your dull clay when your
heart has gone to another. I will show you that I
can live without you."

This was the beginning of a calmer mood, which
he was fain to welcome, though he knew that it was
the ic' calmness of despair. Before the world was
astir in Camberwell Grove she had grown curiously
quiet and rational. She had hated her distorted
features and bound up her hair. She was clothed
and in her right mind again ; and she sat quietly
listening while he told her the story of his temptation,
and how this new love had crept into his heart
unawares, and how an innocent girl's naive preference
had flattered him into infidelity to the love often
years. She listened quietly while he spoke of
the future, trying to make a sunny picture of the
new home, in England or abroad, which she was to
create for herself.

*' You have been far too self-denying," he said;
you have sacrificed even your own comfort to help
me to grow rich. You must at least share my prosperity.
Money need be no object in your future
existence. Choose your new home where you will,
and let it be as bright and enjoyable as ample means
can make it."

*' I will take nothing from you but the bare necessities
of existence," she said. *' I will go to the

obscurest spot that I can find, and rot there alone, or
with my daughter, as you think fit. I may ask one
favour of you. Get me out of this house as soon as
you can. I was once happy here," she added,
hoarsely, looking round the room with an expression
that tortured him.

*' I will take you across the Channel to-day,
if you like. Change of air and scene may
do you good. You have lived too long in this
place."

Ten years too long," she answered, with a faint
laugh.

He went across to Boulogne with her by the
night mail, established her in a private hotel in the
Grande Eue, and left her there within an hour of
their landing, with a pocket-book containing a
hundred pounds in her lap. Nothing could exceed
his tenderness in this parting ; nor could any man's
compassion for a woman he had ceased to love be
deeper than his. He was full of thoughtfulness for
her future. He implored her to think of him as her
devoted friend, to whom her welfare was of the
uttermost importance, to call upon him unhesitatingly

for any help in any scheme of life which she
might make for herself.

"I shall warehouse your furniture at the Pantechnicon,
so that wherever you fix your future
abode it may be conveyed there," he said. " We
took some pains in choosing those things, and you
may prefer them to newer, and even better furniture.
Write to me when you have made your choice of a
new home."

'home," she echoed, and that was all.

"Whenj'ou have found that home and settled
down there, you will have Mercy to share your life,
will you not ? " he pleaded. " The child will be a
comfort to you."

A comfort, yes. She was born under such
happy conditions  she has such reason to be proud
of her parentage ! Mercy  Mercy what ? She
must have some kind of surname, I suppose, before
she is much older. What is she to be called ? ' '

You are very cruel, Evelyn. What does a
name matter ? "

Everything. A name means a history. Should
I be here  and you bidding me good-bje  if my

name were Dalbrook? It is just because my name
is not Dalbrook that you can cast me adrift  like a
rotten boat which a man sends down the stream to
be stranded on a mudbank, and moulder there
piece-meal, inch by inch."

VOL. III.

CHAPTER XII.

*' One little flash of summer light,
One brief and passionate dream."

LoED Cheeiton sent his valet and his portmanteau
to Victoria Street in a cab, and walked to
Hercules Buildings. It was a short distance from
the terminus, and the movement was a relief to his
troubled brain. He was strangely agitated in approaching
the girl whom he had known only as
Mercy Porter, who had lived to twenty seven years
of age, almost as a stranger to him, whom he had
looked upon in her girlhood with a keen and painful
interest, but an interest which he had never betrayed
by one outward sign. It was her mother's perversity
and wrongheadedness, be told himself, which
bad necessitated this complete estrangement. Had
she consented to bring up ber daughter anywhere

else he might have acted in sometime as a father
to her. But she had chosen to plant the girl
there, at his gates, in the sight of his wife
and her child ; and he was thus constrained to
ignore the tie, to repress every token of interest,
every sign of emotion, to act his life-long
lie, and play his part of benefactor and patron to
the end.

And now he had reason to believe that Mercy had
discovered the secret of her birth. Her contemptuous
refusal of his bounty could proceed, he
thought, from no other cause. She knew that he
was her father, and she would accept no boon from
a father who had denied her his name and his
love.

She resented her mother's wrongs, as well as her
own. His heart sank at the thought of standing
before her  his daughter and his judge !

The house in Hercules Buildings was decent and
clean-looking. The woman who opened the door
told him that Miss Gray was at home, and directed
him to the second floor back.

Is she alone ?" he asked. *' Has there been no
one with her this morning ? "

p 2

''No, sir. She don't have anybody come to see
her once in six months, except Miss Newton'*

Lady Cheriton's conjecture was not the inspiration
he had thought. Mrs. Porter had not made
her way here. What if she had doubled back after
starting in the train for London  got out at the
first station and gone to the Priory  to realize that
ghastly apprehension of Theodore Dalbrook's, and
to follow up her scheme of vengeance by some new
crime. Once admit that she was mad, and there
was no limit to the evil she might attempt and do.
His only comfort was in the idea that Juanita's cousin
was there, on the alert to guard her from every
possible attack.

He knocked at the door of the back room on the
second floor landing, and it was opened by the
faded woman he had seen last in her fresh young
beauty, a fair, bright face at a rustic casement,
framed in verdure. The face was sadly aged since
he had looked upon it, and if it was beautiful
still it was with the beauty of outline and expression,
rather than of youthful freshness and colouring.


The grave sad eyes were lifted to his face as

Mercy made way for him to enter. She placed a
chair for him, and stood a little way off, waiting for
him to speak. He looked at the small room with
infinite sadness. Her neatness and ingenuity had
made the best of the poorest means, and the shabby
little room had as fresh and gay an air as if it had
been a room in an Alpine chalet, or a farmhouse in
Normandy. The poor little pallet-bed was hidden
by white dimity curtains, the washstand was
screened by a drapery of the same white dimity,
daintily arranged with bright ribbon bows. There
was a shelf of neatly bound books above the mantelpiece,
and there were bits of Japanese china here
and there, giving a touch of brilliant colour to the
cheap white paper on the walls and the white
draperies. The room had been furnished by Mercy
herself. The chairs were of wicker work, cushioned
and decorated by Mercy's clever hands. There was
a pine chest of drawers, with a Japanese looking
glass hanging above it, and there was a quaint little
japanned table of bright vermilion at the side of
Mercy's arm chair. That poor little second-floor
bedroom, with its one window, and most unlovely
outlook, was Mercy's only source of pride. She had

pinched herself to buy those inexpensive chairs, and
the luxury of the Japanese glass, the lacquered tea-tray
with its Satsuma cups and saucers, and the turquoise
and absinthe tinted vases, all those trifling
details which made her room so different from the
rooms of most work girls. She had stained and
waxed the old deal boards with her own hands, and
it was her own labour that kept the floor polished
and distress, and the window panes bright and clear.
The natural instinct of a lady showed itself in that
love of fair surroundings.

** I hoped to find your mother with you," said Lord
Cheriton.

< Why ? I received your telegram, and could not
understand what it meant. Is there anything wrong
with my mother ? ' '

She left her home early this morning  suddenly
no one knows why or wherefore. I am intensely
anxious to find her."

** But why ? She has been able to take care
of herself very well for the last twenty years.
You have not been particularly interested in her
all that time. Why should you be anxious today?"


*' Because I have reason to think that all is not
well with her  that her mind is not quite right 
and I am full of fear lest she should do something
rash."

*god help her," sighed Mercy, the pale face
growing just a shade whiter. " If you had seen
much of her in the years that are gone your fears
would not have come so late in the day."

What do you mean ? "

I mean that her mind has been unsettled ever
since I was old enough to observe and to understand
her. I was little more than a child when I found
out that she had brooded upon one great sorrow
until all her thoughts were warped  all charity
and kindly feeling were dead in her  dead or frozen
into a dreadful numbness, a torpor of the soul. She
never really loved me  me, her only child, who tried
very hard to win her love. God knows how I loved
her, having no one else to love. There was always
a barrier between us  the barrier of some bitter
memory. I could never get near her heart."

He did not answer for some minutes, but stood
up looking out of the window at the dreary prospect
of slated roof and smoke-blackened chimney-pot,

prospect in which a few red tiles or an old gable-end
were as a glimpse of beauty, amidst the all pervading
greyness and cruel monotony of form and
hue. He felt a constraint upon him such as he had
never felt in all his life before  felt tongue-tied,
helpless, paralyzed by a deep sense of shame and
self - humiliation before this unacknowledged
daughter, who under happier circumstances might
have looked up to him and honoured him as the first
among men. In this bitter hour the name that he
had won for himself in the world, the fortune which
his talent had earned for him were as dust and ashes
the bitter ashes beneath the dazzling brightness
of the dead sea fruit.

"Why do you stop in this back room, Mercy?"
he asked abruptly. '* Why do you condemn yourself
to look out upon chimney-pots and blackened
roofs, when you have all the world to choose from if
you like ? Why in pity's name did you refuse my
offer of an income ? "

Because I will take nothing from you  nothing
nothing  nothing ! "

Her lips closed in a rigid line after that

reiterated word. Her eyes looked straight before
her, cold, calm, resolute.

Why are you so hard upon me ? "

Why '? You ask me why  you, who let me live
at your gates in meek dependence on your bounty,
nameless, fatherless, living a life of miserable monotony
with a heart-broken woman in whose frozen
breast even maternal love was dead. You who patted
me on the head once in half-a-year, and patronized
me, and condescended to me, as if I were of another
race and of a different clay. You, my father  you
who could be content to let me grow from a child to
a woman and never once let your heart go out to me,
and never once be moved to clasp me in your arms
and confess the tie between us. You who saw me
come to your fine house and go away, and often
pretended not to see me, or passed me with a side
glance and a little motion of your hand as if I
were a dog that ran by you in the street. You,
my father  you, whose friend saw me so friendless
and alone that he could lie to me with impunity,
knowing there was no one in this world to take
my part or to call him to account for his lies. Had

you been different, my fate might have been different."


He was a villain, Mercy. God knows, I have
suffered enough on that score. I would have called
him to account, I would have punished him ; but I
had to think of my wife. I dared not act  there
was a monster in my path before which the boldest
man sometimes turns coward  publicity. Who was
it told you, Mercy  when was it that you discovered
my secret ? "

"He told me  taunted me with my mother's
story. He had guessed it, I think ; but though he
had no proofs to give me instinct told me that it was
true. My mother's life and character had always
been a mystery to me. I understood both by the
light of that revelation."

He told you the truth, Mercy. Yes, all my
life as regards you was a solemn sham. It was
your mother's determination to live at Cheriton, and
nowhere else, which made me a stranger to my own
child. Had your home been elsewhere  far from
my wife and her surroundings  I might have acted
in some wise a father's part. I might have acknowledged
our relationship  I might have seen

you from time to time in the freedom of paternal
intercourse  I could have interested myself in
your education, watched over your welfare. As it
was I had to play my difficult part as best I
might."

*you would have had to reckon with my
mother's broken heart wherever she had lived,"
answered Mercy. " Do you think I could have ever
valued your fatherly interest, knowing the measure
of her wrong ? In my ignorance I looked up to
you as our benefactor. You cheated me of my
gratitude and respect  you, who were the cause of
all our sorrows. I saw my mother's mind growing
more and more embittered as the years went by.
My youth was spent with a woman whose lips
had forgotten how to smile  with a mother who
never spoke a motherly word, or kissed her child
with a motherly kiss. And then when love came 
or that which seemed love  can you wonder that I
was weak and helpless in the hour of temptation  I,
who had never known what tenderness meant before
I heard his voice, before his lips touched mine ? The
only happiness I ever knew upon this earth was
my happiness with him. It was short enough, God

knows, but it was something. It was my only
sunshine  the only year in all my life in
which the world seemed beautiful and life worth
living. Yes, it was at least a dream of loving
and being loved ; but it was followed by a bitter
waking."

*'He was a scoundrel, Mercy. You were not his
first victim ; but his youth was past, and I believed
in his reform. I should not have asked him to my
wife's house had I not so believed. When I heard
that he had tempted you away from your mother I
was in despair. I would have made any sacrifice to
save you, except the one sacrifice of facing a hideous
scandal, except the sacrifice of my social position
and my wife's happiness. Had you alone been in
question I might have taken a bolder and more
generous course, but you are right when you say I
had to reckon with your mother. I might have confessed
the existence of my daughter  might have
secured my wife's kindness and sympathy for that
daughter  but how could I say to her, The woman
who lives beside your gate is the woman who ought
to have been my wife, and who for ten years was tome

as a wife, and relied upon my promise that no
other woman upon earth should ever occupy that
place ? I was fettered, Mercy, caught in the toils
powerless to act a manly part. I did what I could,
I tried to trace you and Tremayne  failed, and never
knew what had become of him till I read of his
death in Afghanistan. He was a married man when
he crossed your path, separated from his wife,
who had not used him over well. It was the
knowledge of his domestic troubles that inclined
me to hold out the hand of friendship to him at
that time. He behaved infamously to you, I fear,
my poor girl."

** He only did what most men do, I suppose,
under the same circumstances. He only acted as
you acted to my mother. He grew tired of me.
Only his weariness came in less than ten years 
in less than two. He took me roaming all over
the world in his yacht. Those days and nights
at sea  or lying off some white city, gleaming-against
a background of olive-clad hills  were like
one long dream of beauty. Sometimes we lived
on shore for a little while  in some obscure fishing

Tillage, where there was no one from England to
ask who we were. We spent one long winter
coasting about between Algiers and Tunis. I
could hardly believe that it was winter in that
world of purple sea and sky and almost perpetual
sunshine. We spent half a year among the Greek
islands  we stayed at Constantinople  and sailed
from there to Naples. It was at Naples I caught a
fever, and lay ill on board the yacht. Ifcwas a
tedious illness, a long night of darkness and delirium.
When I recovered Colonel Tremayne was
gone. He had left the yacht on the first day of my
unconsciousness, leaving me in charge of a sister of
mercy and three sailors. He had sold the yacht,
which was to pass into the new owner's possession
as soon as I was strong enough to go on shore. He
left me a letter, telling me that he had deposited fifty
pounds for me at the English bankers where he had
been in the habit of cashing cheques. I had been
at the bank with him on more than one occasion.
He advised me to stay in the South, and get a situation
as governess in an Italian family. He was
obliged to go back to England on account of

monetary difficulties, but he hoped to be able to
meet me later. He did not even take the trouble
to tell me where a letter would find him. He had
abandoned me at the beginning of a dangerous illness
 left me to live or die  friendless in a foreign
land."

CHAPTER XIII.

Poor wretches that depend
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
Wake and find nothing."

Lord Cheriton heard the story of his daughter's
fate in silence. It was an old and a common story,
and any words of reprobation uttered now would
have seemed a mockery from the lips of the father
who had allowed his daughter's seducer to go unpunished.


What did you do in your loneliness ? " he asked,
after a pause.

I wandered from village to village for some
months, living as the peasants live. I did not take
Colonel Tremayne's advice, and offer myself as a
teacher of youth. I did not try to enter a respectable
home under a false character. I lived among
peasants and as they lived, and my money lasted a

long time. I had always been fond of needlework,
so I bought some materials before I left Naples, and
T used to sit in the olive woods, or by the sea shore,
making baby linen, which I was able to dispose of
\hen my wanderings brought me to Genoa, where I
lived in a garret all through the winter after my illness.
I remained in Italy for more than a year,
and then my heart sickened of the beauty of the sea
and sky, the streets of palaces, the orange groves
and olive woods, the bright monotony of loveliness.
Some of my own misery seemed to have mixed itself
with all that was loveliest in that Southern world,
and I felt as if grey skies and dull streets would bea
relief to me. So I came to London, and found
this lodging, and have managed to live  as you see
ever since. I have no wish to live any better. I
have only one friend in the world. I have no desire
to change. If my mother cared for me and wanted
me I would go to her  but she never wanted me in
the past, and I doubt if she will ever want me in
the future."

Your mother is a most unhappy woman, Mercy,
and she has made her unhappiness a part of my life,
and a part of other lives. She left her home this

VOL III. Q

morning, alone, without giving any one notice where
she was going, or why she was going. I am full of
fear about her. My only hope was to find her
here."

** And not having found her here, what are you
going to do ? Where will you look for her ? "

*' I don't know. I am altogether at fault. She
had no friends in London, or anywhere else. She
had isolated herself most completely. At Cheriton
she was respected, hut she made no friends. How
could she make friends in a place where her whole
existence was a secret ? Ah, Mercy, have compassion
upon me in my trouble  give me something of a
child's love, for the burden of my sin is too heavy
for me to bear."

He sank into a chair, covering his face with his
hands, and she knew that the strong man was crying
like a child.

Her heart was touched by his distress, as a woman
if not as a daughter.

*' I am sorry for you in your trouble," she said, ina
low voice, " and I would gladly help you if I could.
But I cannot forget my mother's broken heart  the
slow torture of long years. I had to look on and see

her suffer, not even knowing the cause of her sorrow,
utterly unable to comfort her. Sorrow had hardened
her. She was hard to me, a hard task-mistress
rather than a mother. And now you tell me she has
gone away, no one knows where. What can I do to
help you and her ? "

** God knows if you can do anything, Mercy," he
answered, looking up at her gently, relieved somewhat
by those unaccustomed tears.

He took her hand, which she did not withhold
from him.

Sit down, Mercy," he said, " sit here by my side,
and let us consider calmly what we can do. Your
mother has no friends to whom she could go, no one,
unless it were Miss Newton."

Miss Newton," cried Mercy. "What does my
mother know of Miss Newton ? "

** They were acquainted many years ago, but your
mother would hardly go to her now."

My mother knew Miss Newton, my one
friend ? "

"Yes, long ago. How did you come to know
her ? "

She sought me out. It is the business of her

Q 2

life to seek out those who have most need of her, to
whom her friendship can do most good. She heard
of me from a girl who lives in this house, and she
came to me and invited me to her lodgings, and
brightened my life by her kindness. And did she
really know my mother, years ago?"

Yes, more than thirty years ago, when they
were both young."

How strange that is."

"I am thinking, Mercy; I am trying to think
what refuge your mother could have found in
London ? Remember I have to think of her as of
one who is scarcely accountable for her actions. I
have to think of her as under the influence of one
fixed idea  not governed by the same laws that
govern other people."

**I am powerless to help you," answered Mercy,
hopelessly. '* I will do anything you tell me to do
  but of all people in this world I am least able to
advise you. I know nothing of my mother's life
except as I saw it at Cheriton  one long weariness.'

*' You shall know all by-and-by ; all. I will
stand before you as a criminal before his judge. I
will Jay bare my heart to you as a penitent before

his father-confessor  and then perhaps, when you
have heard the whole story, you will take compassion
upon me  you will understand how hard a part I
had to play  and that I was not altogether vile. I
will say no more about your life here, and your
future life, as I would have it, until that confession
has been made. Then it will remain for you to
decide whether I am worthy to be treated in some-wise
as a father."

She sat in silence, with her head bent over her
folded hands. He looked at the dejected droop of
the head, the grey threads in the auburn hair, the
hollow cheek, the attenuated features and wan
complexion, and remembered how brilliant a creature
she had been in the first bloom of her beauty, and
with what furtive apprehensive glances he, her
father, had admired that girlish face. She was
handsomer in those days than ever her mother had
been, with a softer, more refined loveliness than the
Strangway type. And he had let this flower grow
beside his gate like a weed, and be trampled underfoot
like a weed ; and now the face bore upon it all
the traces of suffering, the lines about the mouth
had taken the same embittered look that he remembered

only too well in Evelyn Darcy, that look of
silent protest against Fate.

He watched her for some minutes in an agony of
remorse. She was his daughter, and it had been
his duty to shelter her from the storms of life  and
he had let the storms beat upon that undefended
head, he had let her suffer as the nameless waifs of
this world have to suffer, uncared for, unavenged.

If she should ever be brought to forgive him, could
he ever forgive himself?

But he had nearer anxieties than these sad
thoughts of that which might have been and that
which was. He had the missing woman to think of,
and the evil that might come to herself or others from
her being at large. He had to speculate upon her
motive in leaving Cheriton.

Perhaps it was only a natural result of his interview
with her yesterday afternoon, when he had
shown her the pistol, and told her where it had
been found, that pistol which he and she knew so
well  one of a pair that had been in her husband's
possession at the time of her marriage  which had
been pledged while they were living in Essex Street,
and when their funds were at the lowest. She had

kept the duplicate, with other duplicates which
Darcy's carelessness abandoned to her  and afterwards
some womanish apprehension of danger in
the somewhat isolated cottage in Camberwell Grove
some talk of burglarious attacks in the neighbourhood
 had induced her to redeem the pistols, and
they had been kept in their case on the table
beside her bed for years. No burglar had ever
troubled the quiet cottage, where there was neither
plate-chest nor jewel-case to tempt an attack. The
pistols had never been used. They had been packed
up with other things and stored in the Pantechnicon,
and James Dalbrook had forgotten the existence of
Captain Darcy's revolvers till the builder's foreman
showed him the pistol that had been found in the
well. Then there came back upon him, in a flash,
the memory of the case that had stood beside his
bed, and the fact that the pistols had been sent
down to Cheriton with Mrs. Darcy's other goods.
That pistol could not have passed out of her possession
without her knowledge and consent. If hers
was not the hand that pulled the trigger, she must,
at least, have furnished the weapon, and she must
have known the murderer.

He told lier as much as this, yesterday afternoon,
when he showed her the pistol. She heard him in
dogged silence, looking at him with wide-open eyes,
in which the dilatation of the pupil never altered.
She neither admitted nor denied anything. He could
extort no answer from her, except some scornful and
evasive retort. And so he left her in despair, having
warned her that discovery was now a question of
time. The finding of the pistol would put the
police on the right track, and link hy link the chain
of circumstantial evidence would be fitted together.

You had better tell me the truth, and let me
help ycu, if I can," he told her.

She had acted upon his warning perhaps, but without
his help. It was like her perverse nature to go
out into the world alone, to make a mysterious disappearance
just at the time when suspicion might at
any moment be directed towards her, just when it
was most essential that there should be not the
slightest deviation from the sluggish course of her
every day life.

Lord Cheriton started up suddenly.

"Yes, that is at least an idea," he muttered.
** Good-bye, Mercy. I have thought of a place where

your mother might possibly go  a place associated
with her past life. It is a forlorn hope, but I mayas
well look for her there. Wherever and whenever
I find her you will come to her, will you not, if she
should need your love ? "

Of course I will go to her  and if she has no
other shelter I can bring her here. I should not be
afraid to work for her."

'' It is cruel of you to talk of working for her.
You know that the want of money has never been an
element in her troubles. She might have lived an
easy and refined life among pleasant people if she
would have been persuaded by me. As it was, I
did what I could to make her life comfortable."

Yes, I know she had plenty of money. She
gave me expensive masters, as if she had been a
woman of fortune. I used to wonder how she could
afford it. eye lived very simply, almost like hermits,
but there seemed always money for everything she
wanted. Our clothes, our furniture, and books
seemed far too good for our station. I used to
wonder who and what we were ; and I have been
asked questions sometimes about my former home.
What did I remember of my childhood ? Where

had I lived before my father died ? I could tell
people nothing. I only remembered a cottage
among fields, and the faces of the woman who
nursed me and her children who played with me.
I remembered nothing but the cottage, and the great
cornfields, and the lanes and hedgerows, till one
summer day my mother came in a carriage, and
took me on a journey by the railroad  a journey that
lasted a long time, for we had to wait and change
trains more than once  and in the evening I found
myself at Cheriton. That was all of my life that I
could recall, and I did not even know the name of
the woman with whom I lived till I was seven years
old, or of the village near her cottage."

You were hardly used, Mercy ; but it was not
all my fault."

He would not tell her that it was his wish to have
her reared at Myrtle Cottage, where he would have
watched her infancy and childhood ; he would not
tell her that it was the mother's sensitiveness, her
resentful consciousness of her false position, which
had banished the child.

You will come to me whenever I summon you,
Mercy ? " he said.

** Yes, I will come."

He held out his hand, and she gave him hers,
which was cold as death. He drew her to his breast,
and kissed the pallid, care-worn forehead, and so
they parted, father and daughter, the daughter acknowledged
for the first time at seven-ands twenty
years of age.

Lord Cheriton hailed the first hansom he found
upon his way, and told the man to drive him to
Camberwell Grove.

The neighbourhood through which he went was
curiously unfamiliar after the changes and forgetfulness
of twenty years ; and yet it was curiously familiar
to him, and brought back the memory of that
dead time, when a man who was himself, and yet
not himself, had gone to and fro that road until its
every shop-front and every street corner seemed
engraved upon his brain.

It is a busy, teeming world  a world of seething
humanity, jostling, striving, anxious, hollow-checked
and eager-eyed. He had chosen to plant his hidden
Eden upon *' the Surrey side," and had gone to and
fro by that squalid highway with a contented spirit,
because it was a world in which he was least likely

to meet any of his professional brotherhood. What
other barrister in decent practice, what other Queen's
Counsel, above all, was likely to pitch his tent
at Camberwell ? There might be old-fashioned men
who would be content to grow their early cucumbers,
and gloat over their pines and peaches in some
citizen's paradise on Clapham Common. There
might be men who would resign themselves to life at
Wandsworth ; but where was the spirit so lowly
within the precincts of the Lamb who would stoop
to live in a place which was accessible only by the
Elephant and Castle and the Walworth Road ? Do
not the very names of those places stink in the
nostrils of gentility ? The Elephant has never held
up his trunk since the glories of the Queen's Bench
departed, since Chabot was written on those walls
against which Lord Huntington played rackets,
and in whose shadow so many of Earth's great ones
have paced up and down in the days when the noble
debtor was still a person apart and distinguished,
not amenable to the laws which govern the bankrupt
trader.

He had borne with the Walworth Road because it
lay so far out of gentility's track. The very odour

of the neighbourhood was familiar  the reek of
cooked meats and stale vegetables, blended with
all-pervading fumes of beer. But there were
numerous changes. He missed familiar shops and
well-remembered features. All that had been
shabby of old looked still shabbier to-day. How
often he had tramped those pavements, economizing
the cost of a cab, and not caring to rub shoulders
with the habitues of the knife-board on Atlas or
Waterloo. The walk had suited him. He could
think out the brief read overnight as he tramped to
Westminster in the morning. How well he remembered
the cool breath of the river blowing up the
Westminster Road on bright spring mornings, when
the flower girls were offering violets and primroses
at the street corners. How well he remembered the
change to a cleaner and a statelier world when he
had crossed the bridge  the solemn grandeur of
Westminster Hall, the close, sickly atmosphere of
the crowded courts. Looking back he wondered
how he bore the monotony of that laborious life,
forgetting that he had been borne up and carried
along by his ambition, always looking onward to the
dav when his name and fortune should be made,

and lie should taste the strong wine of success. He
remembered what an idle dream Evelyn's idea of
buying the Cheriton estate had seemed to him when
first she mooted it ; how he had talked of it only to
indulge her fancy, as one discusses impossible things
with a child ; and how by slow degrees the notion
of its feasibility had crept into his mind ; how he
had begun to calculate the possibilities of his future
savings ; how he had covered stray half sheets of
paper with elaborate calculations, taking pleasure in
the mere figures as if they were actual money. He
remembered how, when he had saved five thousand
pounds, a rabid eagerness to accumulate took hold of
him, and with what keen eyes he used to look at the
figures on a brief. He had caught the infection of
Evelyn's sanguine temper, and of Evelyn's parsimonious
habits. They used to hang over his bankbook
sometimes of an evening, as Paolo and Francesca
hung over the story of Launcelot, calculating
how much could be spared to be placed on deposit,
how little they could contrive to live on for the next
quarter. As the hoard increased Evelyn grew to
grudge herself the smallest luxury, a few flowering
plants for the drawing-room, a day's hire of the

jobbing gardener, a drive in a hansom to Richmond
or Greenwich, little pleasures that had relieved the
monotony of their isolation.

** My father cannot live many years," she told
James Dalbrook, "and when he dies the estate will
have to be sold. I have often heard him say so."

Mr. Dalbrook went on a stolen journey to Cheriton,
and saw every bit of the estate which he could
get to see. He was careful to say nothing of this
expedition to Evelyn lest she should want to go
with him, as he felt that her presence would have
been a difficulty. Some one might have recognized
the Squire's young daughter in the mature woman.

He went back to London passionately in love with
the property, which he remembered as one of the
paradises of his boyhood, in the days when he had
been fond of long excursions on foot to Corse, or
Swanage, or the great sunburnt hills by the sea.
He saw Cheriton Chase now with the entranced eyes
of an ambitious man to whom territorial possession
seemed the crowning glory of life.

He had saved ten thousand pounds, very little
compared with the sum which would be required ;
but he told himself that when he had amassed

another ten he might feel secure of being able to
buy the estate, since it would be easy to raise seventy
per cent, of the purchase money on mortgage. He
began to see his way to the realization of that dream.
He would have to go on living laborious days  to goon
with those habits of self-denial which had already
become a second nature  even after the prize was
won ; but he saw himself the owner of that noble
old house, amidst a park and woodland that were
the growth of centuries; and he thought of the
delight of restoring and improving and repairing,
after fifty years of slipshod] poverty and gradual
decay.

And now, as the hoard increased to twelve, fifteen,
eighteen thousand, James Dalbrook began to talk to
his companion of their future ownership of Cheriton
as a certainty. They planned].the]rooms they were
to occupy ; they allotted their small stock of furniture
about the old mansion house  things they had
bought by slow degrees in the happy hunting-grounds
of Ardour Street and the Portland Road,
and which were all good of their kind. They discussed
the number of servants that they could
manage to carry on with for the first few years, while

economy would still be needful. It was understood
between them, though rarely spoken about, that
Tom Darcy would be dead before that fruition of
their dreams. He had been sent off to Canada, a
broken man. Who could doubt that a few years
more would see the end of that worthless existence ?
And then the bond between those two who had held
to each other so faithfully would be realized, and
Evelyn could go back to the house in which she was
born, its proud and happy mistress.

She had fed upon those dreams, lived upon them,
had thought of little else in her solitary days, in the
isolation of her home. She had put away her child
with stern resolve that no difficulty should arise out
of that existence when she came to take her place
in society as James Dalbrook's wife. She never
meant to acknowledge the daughter born at Myrtle
Cottage. She would do her duty to the child somehow
; but not in that way.

Lord Cheriton remembered all these things as the
cab rattled along the Walworth Road. Our waking
thoughts have sometimes almost the rapidity of our
dreams. He surveyed the panorama of the past ;
recalled the final bitterness of that meeting: at

o
VOL. III. R

Boulogne, when he went over to see Mrs. Darcy,
and when he had to tell her that he was master of
Cheriton Chase, by the help of his wife's dowry,
and that he had begun life there on a far more
dignified footing than they two had contemplated.

She received the announcement with sullen
silence, but he could see that it hurt her like the
thrust of a sword. She stood before him with a
lowering brow, white to the lips, her thin fingers
twisting themselves in and out of each other with a
convulsive movement, and one corner of the bloodless
under lip caught under the sharp white teeth
fiercely.

Well," she said at last, " I congratulate you.
Cheriton has a new master ; and if the lady of the
house is not the woman whose shadow I used to see
there in my dreams  it matters very little to you.
You are the gainer in all ways. You have got the
place jou wanted ; and a fair young wife instead of
a faded  mistress."

She lifted up her eyes, pale with anguish, and
looked at him with an expression he had never been
able to forget.

He was silent under this thrust, and then, after

a troubled pause, he asked her if she had made up
her mind where her future days were to be spent.
He was only desirous to see her settled in some
pretty neighbourhood, in the nicest house that she
could find for herself, or that he could choose for
her.

Do not let money be any consideration," he
said. *' My fees are rolling in very fast this year,
and they are big fees. I want to see you happily
circumstanced, with Mercy."

There is only one place I care to live in," she
answered, " and that is Cheriton Chase."

He told her, with a sad smile, that Cheriton was
the only place that was impossible for her.

It is not impossible. Do you think I want to
be a fine lady, or to tell people that I was once
Evelyn Strangway ? I only want to live upon the
soil I love  and to see you, sometimes, as you
go past my door. There is the West Lodge, now
one of the most picturesque old cottages in England.
I loved it when I was a girl. Sally Newton
and I used to picnic there, when my father and I
were not on speaking terms. Who is living in that
cottage now? "

R 2

One of the gardeners."

Turn out the gardener and let me live there."

He rejected the idea as preposterous, degrading,
that she should live at the lodge gates, she who had
once been the Squire's daughter.

Do not talk to me of degradation," she answered,
bitterly. ' There will be no degradation for me in
living at your gates, now that you and I are
strangers. My degradation belongs to the past.
Nothing in the future can touch me. I am nameless
henceforward, a nullity."

** But if you should be recognized there ? "

** Who is there to recognize me ? Do you think
there is one line or one look of Evelyn Strangely's
sixteen - year - old face left in my face today?"


Knowing the portrait in the hall at Cheriton he
was fain to confess that the change was complete.
It would have been difficult for any one to find the
lines of that proud young beauty in the careworn
features and sunken cheeks of the woman who stood
before him now. The months that had gone by
since their parting had aged her as much as if they
had been years.

** If your husband should find you there ? "

** Not likely ! It is the very last place in which
he would look for me ; and the chances are against
his ever returning to England."

** Why is your mind set upon living at Cheriton?"


** Why? Because I have dreamt and thought of
that place till my love for it has become almost a
disease ; because I have not the faintest interest in
any other spot upon earth. I don't care how I live
there. I have no pride left in me. Pride, self-respect,
care for myself died a sudden death one day
you know of, when I found that you had ceased to
care for me, when I awoke from a long dream and
knew that my place in life was lost. I shall be
content to vegetate in that cottage  and  and if you
think I ought to have Mercy with me, why Mercy
can be there too. I shall be Mrs. Jones, or Mrs.
Brown, and there can be no particular reason why
Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Brown should not have a
daughter."

She was so earnest, so intent, so resolute upon this
and nothing else than this, that he was constrained
to yield to her wishes, and once having yielded, he

did all in his power to make her life comfortable
and free from humiliation. He had the cottage as
tastefully restored as if he had been going to occupy
it himself ; he opened an account for Mrs. Porter at
a Dorchester Bank, and paid in four hundred
pounds to her credit, and he told her that the same
amount would be paid in yearly on the 1st of January.
There should be nothing uncertain or pinched
in her circumstances.

This being done, he resigned himself as best he
might to bear the burden of that unwelcome presence
at his gates. He and the woman who was to
have been his wife rarely spoke to each other during
those long slow sears in which the master of Charlton
grew in honour and dignity and in the respect of
his fellow-men. He whose career Evelyn Darcyhad
watched from the very dawn of success was now a
personage, a man of mark in his native county, a
man who could afford to hold out the hand of friendship
to his less distinguished relatives, and who
could afford to confess himself the son of a small
shopkeeper in the county town.

Lady Cheriton had been inclined to interest herself
in the lonely woman at the West Lodge. She

-was impressed by the unmistakable refinement of
Mrs. Porter's appearance, and wanted to befriend
her ; but Lord Cheriton had forbidden any friendly
relations between his wife and the lodge-keeper, on
the ground that she was a woman of very peculiar
temper, that she would resent anything like patronage,
and that she would infinitely prefer being left
alone to being taken up or petted. The tenderhearted
Maria, always submissive to the husband
she adored, had obeyed without question ; but some
years after, when Mercy was growing up and being
educated by the best masters available in the neighbourhood.
Lady Cheriton had taken a fancy to the
hard-worked girl, and had interested herself warmly
in her progress ; and thus it had happened
that although Mrs. Porter never was known to
cross the threshold of the great house, her daughter
went there often, and was made much of by
Lady Cheriton, and admired by Juanita, whose
accomplishments were still in embryo, while Mercy
was far advanced in music and modern languages.


I suppose her mother means her to go out as a
governess by-and-by," Lady Cheriton told her husband.

*' She is over-educated for any other walk
in life, and in any case she is over-worked. I feel
very sorry for her when I see how tired she looks
sometimes, and how anxious she is about her
studies. Juanita must never be allowed to toil like
that."

Lord Cheriton remembered all that had happened
with reference to the woman who called herself Mrs.
Porter, in all these long years  his daughter Juanita 's
life-time. She had seen the funeral trains of his
infant sons pass through the gate beside her cottage
she had seen the little coffins covered with snow-white
flowers, and she must have known the bitterness
of his disappointment. She had lived at the
West Lodge for all these years, and had made no
sign of a rebellious heart, of anger, jealousy, or
revengeful feeling. He had believed that she was
really content so to live ; that in granting what she
had asked of him he had satisfied her, and that her
sense of wrong was appeased. At first he had lived
in feverish apprehension of some outbreak or scene
some revelation made to the wife he loved, or to
the friends whose esteem he valued; but as the
years went by without bringing him any trouble of

this kind, he had ceased to think with uneasiness of

that sinister figure at his gates.

And now by the light of the hideous confession
which he carried in his breast pocket he knew that
in all those years she had been cherishing her sense
of wrong, heaping up anger and revenge and malice
and every deadly feeling engendered of disappointed
love, against the day of wrath. Could he wonder if
her mind had given way under that slow torture,
until the concealed madness of years culminated in
an act of wild revenge  a seemingly motiveless
crime ? Heaven knows by what distorted reasoning
she had arrived at the resolve to strike her deadly
blow there rather than elsewhere. Heaven knows
what sudden access of malignity might have been
caused by the spectacle of the honeymoon lovers and
their innocent bliss.

The cab had turned into Camberwell Grove, and
now he asked himself if it were not the wildest
fancy to suppose that she might have gone back to
Myrtle Cottage, or that she might be hanging about
the neighbourhood of her old home. The cottage
was in all probability occupied, and even if she had
wandered that way she would most likely have come

and gone before now. The idea had flashed into
his mind as he sat in Mercy's room, the idea that
in her distracted state all her thoughts might revert
to the past, and that her first impulse might lead
her to revisit the house in which she had lived so
lone:.

CHAPTER XIV.

The love of these is Eke the lightning spear,
And shrivels whom it touches. They consume
All things within their reach, and, last of all,
Their lonely selves."

The cottage was to be let. A board offering it
upon a repairing lease announced the fact.

Lord Cheriton opened the familiar gate. The
very sound with which it swung back as he passed
recalled a life that was gone, that had left nothing
but an exceeding bitter sorrow. How weedy and
dejected the narrow garden looked in the sunshine
how moss-grown the gravel path which he and
Evelyn had once taken such pains to weed and
roll, in those early days when that modest suburban
retreat seemed a happy home, and the
demon of ennui had not yet darkened their threshold.


He entered the well-remembered porch over which
the Virginia creeper hung in rank luxuriance.
The house was not unoccupied, for slipshod feet
came along the passage at the sound of the bell,
and he heard children's voices in the back premises.


A slatternly woman, with a year-old baby on her
left arm, opened the door.

*has a lady called here this morning?" he
asked.

Yes, sir, there is a lady here now  in the
drawing-room," the woman answered, eagerly. " I
hope you belong to her, for I've been feeling a bit
nervous about her, with me and the children alone
in the house, and my husband not coming back till
night time. I'm afraid she's not quite right in her
head."

Yes, I belong to her. I have come to fetch
her."

He went into the drawing-room  the room that
had looked pretty and picturesque enough in those
unforgotten days  a small room furnished with
quaint old secretaire and bookcase, Chippendale
chairs, and a carved oak table, a pair of old blue

and white jars on the top of a dark mahogany bureau,
a high, brass fender that used to glitter in the firelight,
sober brown damask curtains, and half-a-dozen
Bartolozzi engravings of rustic subjects, in
neat oval frames  a room that always looked like a
Dutch picture.

Now that room was a scene of squalor and desolation.
For furniture there was nothing but a shabby
Pembroke table, wanting two castors, and two old
cane-seated chairs, in each of which the cane was
broken and bulging. A dilapidated doll, in a ragged
red gauze frock, sprawled amidst the dirt on the bare
floor, and a greasy rug lay in front of the fireless
hearth.

Mrs. Porter was sitting with her elbows on the
table, and her head resting on her clasped hands.
She did not notice Lord Cheriton's approach till he
was standing close beside her, when she looked up
at him.

At first her gaze expressed trouble and bewilderment
; then her face brightened into a quiet smile,
a look of long ago.

*you are earlier than usual, James," she said,
holding out her hand.

He took the hand in his ; it was hot and dry, as
if with a raging fever. It was the hand of a murderess
; but it was also the hand of his victim, and
he could not refuse to take it.

** Was your work over so soon to-day ? " she
asked. *' I'm afraid it will he ever so long before
dinner will be ready, and the house is all in a
muddle  everything wretched "  looking about her
with a puzzled air. " I can't think what has happened
to the rooms," she muttered. ** Servants are
so troublesome."

She passed her hand across her forehead, as if her
head were paining her, and then looked at him
helplessly.

You are ill, Evelyn," he said, gently.

It was twenty years since he had called her by the
name that had been so often on his lips in this
house. It was almost as if the very atmosphere of
the house, even in its desolation, recalled the old
link between them, and made him forgetful of what
had happened in Dorsetshire.

No. I have a headache, that is all. I shall
set to work presently and make everything comfortable
for you. Only I can't find Mary  I can't get

on without Mary. I don't like the look of that
charwoman  a wretched, untidy creature  and I
don't know what she has done with the furniture.
I suppose she moved it in order to clean the rooms.
It is just like their tricks, clearing out the furniture
and then dawdling ever so long before they begin to
scrub the floors."

He looked at her earnestly, wondering whether she
was pretending, whether she had repented that
written acknowledgment of her crime, and was
simulating madness. No, it was real enough. The
eyes, with their dull fixed look and dilated pupils,
the troubled movements of the hands, the tremulous
lips, all told of the unsettled brain. There
was but one course before him, to get her
madness established as an accepted fact before
there was any chance of her crime being discovered.


'' Do not trouble about anything," he said, gently.
*' I will get some of the furniture brought back
presently, and I will get you a servant. Will you
wait quietly here, while I see about two or three
small matters ? "

** Yes, I will wait, but don't be long. It seems

such a long while since yesterday," she said, looking
round the room in a forlorn way, " and everything
is so strangely altered. Don't he long, if you 7nust
go out."

He promised to return in half an hour, and then
he went out and spoke to the woman.
** How did she come here, and when ? "
She walked up to the door. It was just dinner-time
 half-past twelve o'clock. I thought it was
some one to see the house, so I let her in without
asking any questions, and I showed her all the
rooms, and it was some time before I saw she was
wrong in her head. She looked about her just as
people mostly do look, and she was very thoughtful,
as if she was considering whether the place would
suit. And then after she'd been a long time looking
at the rooms and the garden, she went back into the
drawing-room, and sat down at the table. I told
her I should be glad if she could make it convenient
to leave, as I had my washing to do. But she said
she lived here, this was her home, and she told moto
go away and get on with my work. She gave me
such a scare that I didn't know how to answer her.
She spoke very mild, and I could see that she was a

lady ; but I could see that she was out of her mind,
and that frightened me, for fear she should take a
violent turn, and I all alone in the house with those
young children. I was afraid to contradict her, so I
just let her please herself and sit in the drawing-room
alone, while I got on with my bit of washing,
and kept the children well out of the way. I never
felt more thankful in my life than when you rang the
bell."

"I am going as far as the post-office to send off
some telegrams, and I want you to take care she
doesn't leave this house while I'm away," said
Lord Cheriton, emphasizing his request with a
sovereign.

*' Thank you kindly, sir. I'll do my best. I'm
sure I'm sorry for her with all my heart, poor dear
lady."

And I want you to give me the use of this house
for to-day  and possibly for to-night, if by any
chance I should not be able to get her away tonight."


"Yes, sir, you are free and welcome to the
house as far as it's mine to give leave  and it's
been empty too long for there to be much chance

VOL. III. s

of a tenant turning up between now and tomorrow."


Very good. Then I shall send in a little furniture
 just enough to make her comfortable for a
few hours  and when I come back you can get her
something to eat, and make her some tea."

Yes, sir. You won't be gone long, I hope, for
fear she should turn violent ? "

She will not do that. She has never been
violent."

I am very glad to hear that. Appearances are
so deceitful sometimes when folks are wrong in their
heads."

Lord Cheriton had told the cabman to wait. He
got into the cab and drove to the nearest upholsterer's,
where he hired a table, a comfortable sofa,
a couple of chairs, a small square carpet, and some
pillows and blankets, in the event of Mrs. Porter
Laving to bivouac in Myrtle Cottage. He meant her
only to leave that shelter for a place of restraint,
tinder medical care.

This done, he Event to the post-office and telegraphed
first to Marian Gray, Hercules Buildings
: 

** Your mother is at Myrtle Cottage, Camberwell
Grove, and very ill. Go to lier without delay. 
Ckeeiton."

His second telegram was to Dr. Main waring, Wel-beck
Street : 

** Meet me as soon as possible at Myrtle Cottage,
Camberwell Green, and send a trained nurse, experienced
in mental cases, to the same address. I
want your advice upon a case in which time is of
vital importance,"

He sent another telegram to another medical man,
Dr. Wilmot, also an old acquaintance, and a fourth
to Theodore Dalbrook, at the Priory : 

*' Mrs. Porter is in London, and in my care. You
need have no further apprehension."

He was back at Myrtle Cottage within the half
hour, and was able to direct the men who had just
brought a small van containing the furniture. He
saw the things carried into the room that had been
the dining-room, which was empty  the policeman's
family preferring to camp in the kitchen  and had

s 2

them arranged therewith some appearance of comfort.
Then he went hack to the drawing-rooms
where Mrs. Porter was standing at the window,
st: ring at the weeping-ash.

I didn't know the tree was so big," she muttered.


The dining-room is in better order," he said,
gently, " will you come and sit there, while they get
you some tea? "

Yes, James," she answered, meekly, and then
she added, with almost the voice and manner of
twenty years ago, " tell me about your day."

She followed him into the other room, and seated
herself opposite him, looking at him expectantly.
Tell me about your day in the law courts. Was
it dull or interesting ? Had you any great case on ?
I forget. I forget."

She had always questioned him on his return
from the law courts : she had read the reports of all
his cases, and all his rivals' cases, interesting herself
in everything that concerned his career. And
now there was so much of the past in her manner
that his heart ached as he listened to her. He
could not humour her delusion.

*' I have sent for 3-our daughter," he said gravel',
thinking that name might hiring her hack to a
sense of the present time. " She will be here
before long, I believe. I hope you will receive her
kindly."

*' Why have you sent for her '? " she cried, vexed
and startled. " She is very well where she is 
happy and well. The nurse told me so in her last
letter. I can't have her here. You know that,
James,  you know how people would talk 
 how they would ferret out the truth 
by-and-by, when we want to stand clear of the
past "

Evelyn, the past is long past, and our child is a
woman  a sorrowful woman. I want you to take
her to your heart again, if 3-ou have any heart left
in 3'ou."

'Ihave not," she cried, with a sudden change,
appalling in its instantaneousness. " My heart
died within me twenty years ago, when you broke it ;
in this house, yes, in this house, James Dalbrook,
God help me ! I have been dreaming ! I thought I
was living here again in the old time, and that you
Lad come home to me, as you used to come, before

you broke your promise and abandoned me to marry
a rich young wife. Heart ! No, I have a fiery
scorpion here, where my heart used to be. Do you
think if I had had a heart I could have killed him 
that young man who never injured me by so much
as one scornful word ? It was the thought of your
daughter that maddened me  the thought of her
happiness, the sound of the church bells and the
cheering, and the sight of the flags and garlands and
laurel arches  while my daughter, your nameless,
unacknowledged child, was an outcast, and I who
should have been your wife, and the happy mother
of just as happy a bride, I was living in that silent
solitary cottage alone and unloved  upon the land
where my father and his forefathers had been owners
the soil. I had dreamed the dream and you had
realized it. All through those moonlight nights I
was awake and roaming about in the park, from midnight
till dawn, thinking, thinking, thinking, till I
felt as if my brain must burst with the agony
of thought. And then I remembered Tom Darcy's
pistols, and I took one of them with me of a night.
I hardly knew why I carried that pistol about with
me, but I felt a necessity to kill something. Once I

was near shooting one of the red deer, but the
creature looked at me with its plaintive eyes, so bold
and so tame in his sense of security, and I fondled
him instead of killing him. And then I took to
prowling about by the house, and I saw those two iu
the lamp-lit room, in their wedded happiness  their
wedded happiness, James, not such a union as ours,
secret, darkened by a cloud of shame. I saw your
daughter in her bright young beauty, the proud,
triumphant wife : and then a devilish thought took
hold of me  the thought of seeing her Widowed,
broken-hearted ; the thought that I might be her evil
Destiny  that just by stretching out my arm and
pulling a trigger I could bring down all that pride
into the dust  could bring youth and beauty down,
to my level of dull despair."

It was a devilish thought."

"It was; but it was my thought all the same;
for three days and three nights it was never absent
from my mind. God knows how I got through the
common business of the day  how the few people
with whom I came in contact did not see murder in
my face ! I watched and waited for my opportunity;
and when the moment came I did not waver.

There are old people at Cheriton who could tell you
that Evelyn Strangway at fifteen years old was
as good a shot as either of her brothers. My
hand had not forgotten its cunning ; and your
daughter was a widow three weeks after she was
made a wife. By so much as she was happier
than I, by so much was her joy briefer than
mine."

She sank into a corner of the large armchair and
covered her face with her hands, muttering to
herself. He heard the words  " I made myself
her Evil Destiny ; I was her fate  Nemesis,
Nemesis ! The sins of the fathers ! It is the
Scripture."

He could not stay in the room with her after that
confession. She had been perfectly coherent in telling
the story of her crime ; and it seemed to him
that even now she gloated over the evil she had
wrought  that had it been in her power to undo her
work by the lifting of her hand she would hardly
have used that power. She seemed a malignant
spirit, rejoicing in evil.

He went ost into the passage and told the policeman's
wife to look after her, and then he went to the

desolate drawing-room and walked up and down the
bare boards waiting for the arrival of one or both of
the doctors.

What would they think of her mental condition.
She had been curiously coherent just now. The
temporary delusion had passed away like a cloud.
She had spoken as a person fully conscious of her
acts, and accountable for them. Judged by her
speech just now she was a criminal who deserved the
sternest measure of the law.

But he who knew of those long years of brooding,
he who knew the story of her wrongs, and how those
wrongs must have acted upon that proud and stubborn
spirit, to him there seemed little doubt that her
mind had long lost its balance, and that her crime
had been the culminating crisis of a long period of
melancholia. He waited the verdict of the doctors
with acutest anxiety, for only in an asylum did he
see safety for this unhappy sinner. The finding of
the pistol would inevitably be talked about at Cheriton,
and it was possible that at any moment suspicion
might take the right direction. To get her
away, to get her hidden from the world was his
most ardent desire : but this was not inconsistent

with his desire to spare her, to do the best that
could be done for her. The thought that he had
ruined her life  that his wrong doing was at the
root of all her miseries  was never absent from
his mind.

Dr. Main waring was the first to arrive. He was
a man of supreme refinement, gentle, compassionate,
an artist by talent and temperament, intellectual to
the tips of his fingers. He had made insanity and
the care of the insane the work of his life, as his
father and grandfather had done before him, and he
enjoyed the privilege of having been born in an ago
of enlightenment, which they had not even foreseen in
their happiest anticipations. He had met Lord
Cheriton often in London society, and had visited
him in the country, and they were as close friends as
two busy men of the world can be.

He was mystified by so sudden a summons and to
such a locality ; but he had too much tact to betray
any surprise. He listened quietly to Lord Cheriton' s
explanation that he was wanted to form an opinion
of a dependent whose state of mind had given cause
for uneasiness.

I will say very little about her till you have seen

her," said Cberitou. ''If it should appear to you
and to luy friend Wilmot, whom I have asked to
meet you,  if you should decide that she ought to
be placed under restraint, I should wish her to be
removed immediately to your house at Cheshunt. I
know that she will be made as happy there as her
state of mind will admit, and I shall rely upon your
kind consideration for making this a special case."

*you may be assured I shall do my uttermost
for anyone in whom you are interested, my dear
Cheriton, but indeed I think you must know that I
do my uttermost in every case. It is only in some
small details that I can ever show special attention.
Is this poor lady very violent '? "

''No, she is very quiet."

"And there is no suicidal mania, I hope ? "

I have seen no evidence of it; but she left her
home in a strange and motiveless manner this morning,
and that, coupled with other indications in the
past, gave me the alarm"'

Has she any delusions ? "

Yes, it was under a delusion that she came to
this empty house. She lived here many years ago,
and on talking to her just now I found her unconscious

of the lapse of time, and fancying that all
things were still as they were when she was a young
woman''

'' Has she had any illness lately ? "

"None that I know of."

I fear there can be little doubt as to her
malady. Will you take me to her? She will
be less alarmed if you are with me. Oh, by the
bye, the nurse you asked for will be here almost immediately."


*' I am glad of that. There is only a wretched
slattern in the house, whom I don't like to see in
attendance upon my poor friend."

Lord Cheriton and the doctor went into the room,
where Mrs. Porter was sitting facing the window,
staring moodily at the trailing tendrils of Virginia
creeper and passion-flower hanging from the roof of
the verandah and shutting out the light. There
was something unspeakably desolate in that glimpse
of neglected garden seen athwart the neglected
verdure, with the smoky London sky as a background.


She looked round quickly at the sound of footsteps,
and started up from her chair.

Who is this man ? " she asked, turning to Lord
Cheriton. " Are j'ou going to send me to prison?
You have lost no time."

This gentleman is my old friend, and he is interested
in helping you if he can''

You had letter leave us together," said Dr.
Mainwaring, gently.

Lord Cheriton left the room silently, and paced
the narrow entrance hall, listening with intense
anxiety to the low murmuring sound of voices on the
other side of the door.

There were no loud tones from either speaker.
There could be neither anger nor profound agitation
upon Mrs. Porter's side, the listener thought, as he
awaited the result of the interview. A knock at the
hall-door startled him from his expectancy, and he
hastened to admit the new arrival.

It was his other medical friend. Dr. Wilmot, stout
and jovial, more adapted to assist at a wedding thana
funeral, more fitted to prescribe for wine-bibbing
aldermen or dowagers who needed to be 'kept
up " on Roederer or Mum, than to stand beside
the bed of agony, or listening to the ravings
of a mind distraught. Mainwaring came out

of the dining-room at the sound of voices in the
hall.

'' Ah, how do you do, Wilmot ? You will have
very little trouble in making up your mind about this
poor soul. Go in and talk to her while I take a turn
in the garden with his Lordship."

He opened the dining-room door, and Dr. Wilmot
passed in, smiling, agreeable, and beginning at
once in an oily voice, '' My dear lady, my friend
Mainwaring suggests that I should have a little chat
with you while  while Lord Cheriton and he are
admiring the garden. A very nice garden, upon my
word, for the immediate vicinity of London. One
hardly expects such a nice bit of ground now-a-days.
May I feel your pulse ? Thanks, a little too rapid
for perfect health."

*' What do you and that other man mean by all
this pretence ? '' she exclaimed, indignantly. *' I
am not ill. Are you a doctor, or a policeman in
disguise ? If you want to take me to prison I am
ready to go with you. I came to London on purpose
to give myself up. You need not beat about
the bush. I am ready''

Mad, very mad," thought Dr. Wilmot, detaining

the uiiu-illiug wrist, aud noting its tumultuous
pulsations by the second hand of his professional
watch.

Lord Cheriton and Dr. Mainwaring were pacing
slowly up and down the moss-grown gravel while
this was happening.

** How did you find her ? "

** Curiously calm and collected for the first part of
the interview. Had it not been for her troubled
eye, and the nervous movements of her hands, I
should have supposed her as sane as you or I. I
talked to her of indifferent subjects, and her
answers were consecutive and reasonable, although
it was evident she resented my presence. It was
only when I asked her why she had come to London
that she became agitated and incoherent, and began
to talk about having committed a murder, and
wishing to give herself up and make a full confession
of her guilt. Instead of waiting for the law
to find her out she was going to find the law. She
had no fear of the result. She had long been tired
of her life, and she was not afraid of the disgrace of
a felon's death. Her whole manner, as she said
this showed a deep-rooted delusion, and I am of

opinion that her mind has been unhinged for a longtime.
That notion of an imaginary crime is often a
fixed idea in lunacy. A madman will conceive a
murder that never took place, or he will connect
himself with some actual murder, and insist upon
his guilt, often with an extraordinary appearance of
truth and reality, until he is shaken by severe cross-examination."


*' You will receive her in your house at once ? "

I have no objection, if Wilmot's opinion coincides
with mine ; but another medical man must
sign the certificate if she is to enter my house. I
have no doubt as to her being in a condition to
require restraint. She is not violent at present,
but if she is not taken care of she will go wandering
about in search of a police-magistrate, and
with increasing excitement there will be every
likelihood of acute mania. Ah, here comes Wilmot.
Well, what do you think of the case, Wilmot?"


Mad, undeniably mad. She took me for a
policeman, and raved about a murder for which she
wanted to give herself up to justice."

A fixed delusion, you see," said Main waring,

Tvitli a gentle sigh. " Do you know how long lie
lias had this idea, Cheriton ? "

Indeed, I do not. Her position on my estate
was a peculiar one. She lived at one of the lodges,
hut her status was not that of an ordinary dependent.
She was her own mistress, and lived a very
solitary life  after her daughter left her. I have
sent for the daughter, who will he here presently, I
hope. My first notice of anything amiss was a hint
dropped by a young medical man who was visiting
at Cheriton. He saw Mrs. Porter, and formed the
opinion that she either had been off her head in the
past, or was likely to go off her head in the future.
That startled me, and I had it in my mind to ask
you to come down to see her, Mainwaring, when
there came the sudden departure of this morning 
a departure which was so at variance with her
former habits that it made me anxious for her
safety. I followed her to London  first to her
daughter's lodging  and then here  where by mere
guesswork, I found her."

Do you think that it may be the sad event of
last year  the murder of your son-in-law  which
has put this notion into her head ? "

VOL. III. T

*' It is not unlikely. That dreadful event made a
profound impression upon everybody at Cheriton.
She, being a reserved and thoughtful woman, may
have brooded over it."

Until she grew to associate herself with the
crime," said Wilmot. *' Nothing more likely.
Was the murderer never found, by the way ? ' '

Never."

*' But there can be no suspicion against this lady,
I conclude. She can have been in no way concerned
in the crime ? ' '

I think you have only to look at her in order to
be satisfied upon that point," said Lord Cheriton ;
and the two physicians agreed that the poor lady
in question was not of the criminal type, and that
nothing was more common in the history of mental
aberration than the hallucination to which she was a
victim.

Those monotonous lives of annuitants and
genteel dependents  exempt from labour, and to the
outward eye full of placid contentment, do not infrequently
tend towards madness," said Dr.
Wilmot. " I have seen more than one such case
as this. There are some minds that have no need

of action or variety, some natures "U'hicli can
vegetate in a harmless nullity. There are other
tempers which prey upon themselves in solitude,
and brood upon fancies till they lose touch of
realities. This lady is of the latter type, highly
organized, sensitive to a marked degree, of the
ge7ins-i?'ritahile.''

"You will take all necessary steps at once"?''
said Lord Cheriton, looking from one doctor to the
other.

Both were consentient. Dr. Wilmot drove ofi" at
once to find the nearest medical man, and brought
him back in his carriage. A very brief interview
with the patient convinced this gentleman of the
necessity for gentle restraint, and the certificate was
signed by him and Dr. Wilmot.

It was six o'clock, and the shadows were
deepening in the room where Mrs. Porter was
sitting, quiescent, silent, in a kind of apathy from
which she was scarcely roused by the entrance of
the nurse from Cheshunt, a tall comely-looking
woman of about thirty, neatly dressed, and with
pleasant manners.

Mrs. Porter sat there in her dull lethargy, the

T 2

food that had been prepared for her untasted at her
side. The nurse looked at the patient with a keen
professional eye, and from the patient to the tray
where an ill-cooked chop stagnated in a pool of
grease ; and where the unused teacup showed that
even the feminine refreshment of tea had failed to
tempt her.

*' She hasn't eaten anything," said the nurse,
*rand she looks weak and wasted, as if she had
been for a long time without food. You'd
better send for some beef essence and a little brandy.
She ought to be kept up somehow, if she is to betaken
to Cheshunt to-night. It will be a long
drive."

Lord Cheriton despatched the policeman's wife to
the nearest chemist's and the nearest wine merchant's,
while he went himself to a livery stable and
ordered a brougham and pair to be at Myrtle
Cottage at seven o'clock. The certificate had been
feigned, and there was nothing to hinder the
removal of the patient. He found Mercy with her
mother upon his return, but the mother had given
no sign of recognition, and the daughter sorrowfully
acknowledged the necessity of the case after

Dr. Mainwaring had gently explained her mother's
condition to her.

'slam not surprised," she said, Tvith sad submission,
" I saw it coming years ago. I have lain
awake many a night when I was a girl listening
to her footsteps as she walked up and down her
bedroom, and to the heart-broken sigh that she
gave every now and then, in the dead of the
night, when she thought there was no one to hear
her."

An hour later the woman who for twenty years
had been known as Mrs. Porter, and who was to
carry that name to her dying day, was on her way to
The Grange, Cheshunt, with her daughter and the
nurse in the carriage with ber. She had made no
resistance, had gone where she was asked to go, with
an apathetic indifference, had given no trouble ;
but although her daughter had been with her for
an hour, doing all that tender attention could do
to awaken her memory, there had been not a word
or a look from the mother to betoken consciousness
of her existence.

Yet it was clear that the mental powers were only
clouded, not extinguished ; for, as Lord Cheriton

stood a little way outside the porch watching her as
she passed out to the carriage, she stopped suddenly
and looked at him.

"Will yoa and I ever meet again, James
Dalbrook ? " she asked solemnly.

He paled at the address in those clear, incisive
tones, dreading what she might say next.

I think it may he better we should not meet,"
he said gloomily. " I have placed you in the care
of those who will do the best that can be done for
you."

You are sending me to a madhouse, in the care
of a mad doctor. That is your substitute for
Cheriton Chase ; the home I used to dream about
ages ago, in this house ; the home you and I were
to have shared as man and wife. It was my birthplace,
James, and I would to God it had been my
grave before I ever looked upon jour face ! "

The nurse hustled her charge into the carriage,
muttering something about " delusions " ; but Dr.
Mainwaring was too shrewd a student of humanity
not to perceive some meaning in these consecutive
utterances. He had no doubt that Mrs. Porter was
deranged, and a person who would be the better for

the moderate restraint of a well-ordered asylum : but
he had also no doubt that she had her lucid intervals,
and that in this farewell speech she had let in the
light upon her past relations with James Dalbrook,
first Baron Cheriton.

That revelation accounted for some points in the
law-lord's conduct which had hitherto been incomprehensible
to his friend the doctor.

Mine after-life ! what is mine after-life ?
My day is closed ! the gloom of night is come I
A hopeless darkness settles o'er my fate ! "

It seemed to Lord Cheriton as he drove to
Victoria Street in Dr. Mainwaring's brougham, that
the day which had just come to an end had been the
longest day of his life. He looked back at the
sunny morning hour in which he had lingered over
the business of the toilet, brooding upon that discovery
of the pistol, his spirits weighed down by a
vague foreboding, a dim horror of approaching evil,
scarcely able to measure the extent of his own
fears. He recalled the moment at which his valet,
brought him Theodore's brief summons to the West
Lodge  a moment that had given new reality to-all
he dreaded  a summons which told him that the-shadowy
horror which had been beside his pillow all

through the night was going to take a tangible
shape. Oh, God, how long it seemed since that
pencilled line was put into his hand  since he
stood in the blinding sunshine staring at the curt
summons  before he recovered himself so far as
to turn to his servant with his habitual grave
authority, and give some trivial order about his
overcoat.

Since then what slow agonies of apprehension 
what self-abasement before the daughter whom he
met for the first time as his daughter, face to face !
What terror lest the woman whom his perfidy had
driven to madness and to crime should be called
upon to answer to the law for that crime  while
England should ring with the story of Ins treachery,
and his hidden sin ! He felt as if he had lived
through half a life-time of shame and aonv between
the vivid light of the August morning and the
cool grey shadows of the August night. He leant
back in his corner of the cosy little brougham, pale
and dumb, a worn-out man, and his friend the
physician respected his silence.

Will you come home and dine with me, Cheriton
? " said Dr. Main waring, as they crossed the

bridge. *rit may be pleasant for you than the
solitude of your own rooms."

' You are very good. No, I am not fit for society,
not even for yours. I am deeply indebted to you 
I feel that you are indeed my friend  and that you
will do all that can be done to make that broken life
yonder endurable."

You may be sure of that. I would do as much
were Mrs. Porter a nameless waif whom I had found
by the road side ; but as your friend she will have
an unceasing interest for me. Shall you stay long
enough in town to be able to spare time to go and
see her at the Grange ? "

*' No, I must go back to Dorsetshire tomorrow.
I doubt if I shall ever see her again. Accept that
fact as the strongest proof of my confidence in you.
Had I any doubt as to her treatment I would see her
from time to time, at whatever cost of pain to myself."


There is nothing but pain, then, in your present
feeling about that poor lady ? "

*' Nothing but pain."

And yet  forgive me if I touch an old wound 
I think you must once have loved her ? "

The shadows were deepening, the lamps shone
with faint yellow light upon the grey stone
parapet, and the interior of the carriage was
very dark. Perhaps it was the darkness which
emboldened Dr. Mainwaring to push his inquiry
to this point.

"You are right," his friend answered slowly.
*' I loved her once."

The brougham stopped at his lordship's door in
Victoria Street, and then drove northwards with the
physician. There was time for much serious
reflection between "Westminster and AYelbeck
Street.

*' My new patient must be carefully looked after,"
mused the doctor, " for I'm afraid there's more
meaning in her self-accusation than there generally
is in such cases, and that Sir Godfrey Carmichael's
murderer is now in my keeping."

The lung August day passed very quietly at Mil-brook
Priory. Lady Cheriton arrived in the afternoon,
and the three generations spent the summer
hours on the lawn, mother and daughter sitting, at
work under the tulip trees, grandson and nui-se in

that state of perpetual motion which is infancy's
only alternative with perpetual slumber.

Theodore spent his afternoon in a somewhat restless
fashion, and appeared as if possessed by a rage
for locomotion. He rambled about the grounds,
explored the shrubberies, and every yard of the
plantation that girdled the little park. He went to
both lodges, and talked to the caretaker at each. He
made two different excursions to the village, on pretence
of making inquiries at the Post Office, but in
reality with the idea of meeting with, or hearing of,
Mrs. Porter, should she have wandered that way.
He behaved like a member of the secret police who
had been charged with the guardianship of the most
precious life in the land ; and if his movements betrayed
the nervous anxiety of the amateur, rather
than the business-like tranquillity of the professional,
he made up in earnestness for what he lacked in
training and experience.

It was on his return from his second sauntering
perambulation of the village that he found Lord
Cheriton's telegram waiting for him at the Priory.
The relief that message brought was unspeakable,
and his countenance showed the change in

Lis feelings vlien he rejoined the two ladies on the
lawn.

Something very pleasant must have happened
to sou, Theodore," said Juanita. '' You have been
looking the picture of gloom all day, and now you
are suddenly radiant. Have you been talking to one
of the Yicar's pretty daughters ? "

"No, Juanita; neither of those wax-doll beauties
glorified my path. I heard their treble voices on
the other side of the holly-hedge as I passed the
Vicarage, and I'm afraid they were quarrelling. I
have had good news from London."

** From my father ? "

Yes."

Oh, Theodore, why do you torture me by hiding
things from me V Something has happened, I
know."

"You will know all in a few days, Juanita.
Thank God, a great fear that has haunted me for
some time past is now at an end. I can look at you
and your child without seeing the shadow of an
enemy across your path."

She looked at him searchingly.

"All this amounts to nothing," she said. "I

have never feared for myself or thought of myself.
Will my husband's death be avenged, and soon,
soon, soon ? That is the question."

That is a question which you yourself maybe
called upon to answer  and very soon," he
said.

He would say no more, in spite of her feverish
eagerness, her impatient questionings.

"I have changed my mind, Juanita," he said
presently. *' I will not bore you with my company
till I am free to answer your questions.
The motive for my presence in this house is at an
end.

Is it ? What has become of the suspicious
characters my father talked about ? "

The danger has not come this way  as he
feared it might."

Stay," she said. " Whether there is danger or
not you are going to stay. I will not be played fast
and loose with by any visitor. Mother likes to have
you here, and baby likes you."

*' Not so well as he likes Cuthbert Kamsay," retorted
Theodore, with almost involuntary bitterness.


This time Juanita's blush was an obvious
fact.

She walked away from her cousin indignantly.

*' You may go or stay, as you please' she said;
and he stayed, stayed to he a footstool under her feet
if she liked  stayed with a heart gnawed by jealousy,
consumed by despair.

It is useless  hopeless beyond the common
measure of hopelessness," he told himself, " She
never cared for me in the past, and she will never
care for me in the future. I am doomed to stand
for ever upon the same dull plane of affectionate indifference.
If I were dangerously ill she would
nurse me ; if I were in difficulties she would load
me with benefits ; if I were dead she would be sorry
for me ; but she is fonder of Kamsay, whom she has
seen half-a-dozen times in her life, than she will
ever be of me."

Lord Cheriton returned to Dorsetshire on the following
afternoon. He drove from Wareham to the
Priory, and had a long tete-astute with Theodore in
the garden before dinner.

'you have acted for my daughter throughout

tins miserable business," he said, when he had told
all that was to be told about Mrs. Porter's seclusion
at Cheshunt. *' She has confided in you more completely
even than in me  her father, and I leave my
cause in your hands. You must plead to the
daughter for the erring father, whose sin has exercised
a fatal influence upon her life. Win her forgiveness
for me  win her pity for that most unhappy
woman, if you can. It is a difficult task
which I entrust to you, Theodore, but I believe
in your power to move that generous heart to
mercy."

"You may believe in my devotion to you both,"
said Theodore, and Lord Cheriton left the Priory
without seeing his wife and daughter, who had
gone to dress for dinner just before his arrival, and
who came to the drawing-room presently, both expecting
to find him there.

Theodore explained his hasty departure as best he
might.

"Your father drove over to speak to me upon a
matter of business," he said to Juanita. " He was
tired after his journey, and preferred going home to
dine."

He was not ill, I hope '? " cried Lady Cheriton,
with a look of alarm.

No, there is nothing amiss with him, except
fatigue."

Juanita looked at him intently, eager to question
him, hut the butler's entrance to announce dinner
stopped her, and she told Theodore to give his arm
to her mother, and followed them both to the diningroom.


The meal was a mockery as far as two out of
the three were concerned. Juanita was nervous and
ill at ease, impatient of the lengthy ceremonial.
Theodore ate hardly anything, hut kept up a slipshod
conversation with Lady Cheriton, talked
about the grandchild's abnormal intelligence, and
assured her in reply to her reiterated inquiries that
her husband was not ill, was not even looking
ill, and that there was no reason for her to go
back to the Chase that night, as she was disposed
to do.

Juanita rose abruptly before the grapes and
peaches had been taken round.

Would you mind coming to my room at once,
Theodore ? " she said. " I want half-an-hour's talk

VOL. III. u

with you about  business. You will excuse my
leaving you, won't you, mother? "

My dear child, I shall be glad to get half-an-hour
in the nursery. Boyle tells me that little
rascal is never so lively as just before he settles down
for the night."

Lady Cheriton went off in one direction, Juanita
and Theodore in the other.

The lamp was lighted in the study, on the table
where two rows of books told of the widow's studious
solitude.

Theodore glanced at the titles of those neatly-arranged
volumes and saw that they were mostly
upon scientific subjects.

** I did not know that j'ou were fond of science,
Juanita? " he said.

"I am not. I used to hate it. I am as
ignorant as a baby. I don't believe I know anymore
about the moon than Juliet did when she
accused it of inconstancy. Only when one comes
to my age one ought to improve oneself. Godfrey
will be asking me questions before I am
much older  and when he wants to know
whether the earth goes round the sun or the sun

round the earth, I must be prepared to answer
him."

She spoke with a nervous air, facing him
in the soft clear lamp-hight, her hand upon
the row of books, her eyes eager and questioning.


You have seen my father, Theodore. Is the
embargo removed ? "

'' It is."

And you know who murdered my husband ? "

So far as the assassin's own confession is to be
believed, yes."

*' He has confessed  he is in prison  he will be
hanged," she cried breathlessly.

The murderer has confessed  but is not in
prison  and will not be hanged  at least I trust
not, in God's mercy."

You are full of pity for a murderer, Theodore,"
she cried bitterly. " Have you no
pity for my husband ? Is his death to go unpunished?
Is his life  the life that might have
been as long as it was happy  is that to count
for nothing?"

u 2

It is to count for much, Juanita. Believe me,
your husband is avenged. His death was a sacrifice
to a broken heart and a disordered brain. The
hand that killed him is the hand of one who
cannot be called to account  the hand of a madwoman."


"A woman ? "

*eyes, a woman. The woman you have seen
many a time as you passed in and out of Cheriton
Chase in your father's carriage by the West
Gate."

"Mrs. Porter?"

"Yes."

Great God ! why did she kill my husband ? "

*' Because she was unhappy  because she had
suffered until sorrow had obscured her intellect,
till her life had become one long thirst to do
evil  one hatred of youth and beauty, and innocent
gladness like yours. She saw you in
your wedded happiness, and she thought of a
happiness which was once her own day dream
the hope and dream of patient, self-denying
years. She struck at you through sour

husband. She struck at your father through
you."

My father ! What was he to her  ever, excepta
friend and benefactor ? "

He was once more than that to Evelyn Strangely."


'' Strangway ! " shrieked Juanita, clasping her
hands. *' Did I not tell 3'ou so from the first ? It
was the footstep of a Strangway that crept past our
window, while we sat together in our happiness,
without thought of peril. It was a Strangway who
killed my husband. You told me that they were
all dead and gone  that the race was extinct 
that the people I feared were phantoms. I told
you it was a Strangway who fired that shot, and
you see my instinct was truer than your reason
and there was a Strangway at our gates  disguised
 under a false name  looking at us with
smooth, hypocritical smiles  nursing her wrath to
keep it warm."

Unhappily your instinct hit upon the fatal
truth. The hatred of the Strangways was not
dead. One member of that family survived,
and cherished a more than common malignity

against the race that had blotted out the old
name."

*but my father, how had he provoked her
hatred?"

He once loved her, Juanita  many years ago 
before he saw your mother's face. Evelyn Strangely
and he had been lovers  pledged to each other
by a solemn promise. As a man of honour he
should have kept that promise ; there were stringent
reasons that bound him. But he saw your mother
and loved her, and broke with Evelyn Strangway 
openly, with no unmanly deceit ; but still there vas
the broken promise, and that involved a deep wrong.
He believed that wrong forgiven. He believed the
more in her pardon because it was her earnest desire
to live unrecognised and unnoticed upon the estate
where she was born. He could not fathom the
depth of hatred in that warped nature. He did all
that there was left to him to do  having taken his
own course and entered upon a new and fairer life
with the woman he loved  to make amends to the
woman he had deserted. He never suspected the
depth of her feelings  he never suspected the seeds
of madness, with its ever present dangers. He did

what in him lay to atone for the sin of his youth ;
but that sin found him out, and it was his bitter lotto
see his beloved daughter the innocent victim of
bis wrong-doing. He trusted me to tell you this
miserable story, Juanita. He humbles himself in
the dust before you, stricken at the thought of your
suffering. He appeals through me to your love
and to your pity. How am I to answer him when
I answer for you ? "

She was silent for some moments after he
had asked this final question, her eyes fixed,
her chest heaving with the stormy beating of her
heart.

*' What has become of this woman  this pitiless
devil? " she gasped.

She is in a madhouse."

"Is no punishment to overtake her ? Is she not
to be tried for her life ? Let them prove her mad,
or let them find her guilty, and hang her  hang
her  hang her. Her life for his, her worn-out
remnant of wretched, disappointed days for his
bright young life, with all its promise and all its
hope."

*' It would be a poor revenge, Juanita, to take so
poor a life. This unhappy woman is under restraint
that will, in all probability, last till the day of her
death. Her crime is known only to your father and
to me. Were it to become known to others she would
have to stand in the dock, and then the whole
story would have to be told  the story of your
father's broken promise  of this woman's youth,
bound so closely with his that to many it would
seem almost as if they stood side by side at the
bar. Do you think that the fierce rapture of
revenge could ever atone to you for having brought
dishonour upon your father's declining years,
Juanita ? "

And my husband's death is to go unavenged ? "

Do you think there is no retribution in the slow
agony of a shattered mind  the long blank days of
old age in a lunatic asylum, the apathy of a half-extinguished
intellect varied by flashes of bitter
memory. God help and pity such a criminal, for her
punishment must be heavier than hemp and quicklime."


She seemed scarcely to hear him. She was walking

up and down the room, her hands clenched, her
brows contracted over the fixed eyes.

I caught just one glimpse of her as we drove
past; hut that glimpse ought to have been enough,"
she said. *' I can see her face as we passed the
lodge, looking out at us from the parlour window,
within a few hours of my darling's death  a pale
vindictive face  yes, vindictive. I ought to have
understood ; I ought to have taken warning, and
guarded my beloved one from her murderous
hate."

** Yhat am I to say to your father, Juanita ? I
ought not to leave him long in doubt. Think what
it is for a father to humiliate himself before his
daughter  to sue for pardon."

' Oh, but he must not do that. I have nothing
to forgive. How could he understand that there
could be such diabolical malignity in any human
breast ? How could he think that the wrong done by
him would be revenged upon that innocent head ?
Oh, if she had gone a nearer way to revenge herself
if she had killed me, rather than him. It is such
bitterness to know that my love brought him untimely
death  that he might have been here now.

happy, with long years of honour and content before
him if he had chosen any other wife."

It is hopeless to think of what might have been,
Nita. Your husband was happy in your love  and
not unhappy in his death. Such a fate is far better
than the dull and slow decay which closes many a
fortunate life  the inch by inch dissolution of a
protracted old age  the gradual extinction of mind
and feeling  the apathetic end. You must not talk
as if your husband's death was the extremity of
misfortune."

'* It was  for me. Can I forget what it was to
lose him? Oh, there is no use in talking of my
loss. I wanted to avenge his death. I have lived
for that  and I am cheated of even that poor comfort."


What shall I say to your father ? "

** Say that I will do nothing to injure him  or to
distress my mother. I will remember that I am
their daughter, as well as Godfrey's widow. Goodnight,
Theodore. You have done your uttermost
to help me. We cannot help it, either of us, if Fate
was against us."

She gave him her hand, very cold, but with the

firm grasp of friendship. The very touch of that
hand told him he would never he more to her thana
friend. Not so is a woman's hand given when the
impassioned heart goes with it.

"A malady
Preys on my heart that medicine cannot reach,
Invisible and cureless."

Mrs. Porter's banishment created considerable
talk in the little village of Cheriton, and would
doubtless have been the occasion of still greater
wonder but for the impenetrable stupidity of the
young maidservant, from whom no detailed account
of her mistress's departure could be extorted. Had
the girl Phoebe been observant and loquacious she
might have stimulated public curiosity by a lively
narrative of events; setting forth Theodore Dal-brook's
emotion at finding the lodge deserted; and
how he had sent up to the house for his Lordship ;
and how his Lordship and Mr. Dalbrook had remained
in earnest conversation for nearly an hour in
the lodge parlour ; and how Mrs. Porter had left a

mahogany box upon the table, a flat mahogany box
with brass corners, which Phoebe had never seen
before ; and how this very box had disappeared
mysteriously when the two gentlemen left. All this
would have afforded mental pabulum for the acuter
wits of the village, and would have formed the
nucleus of an interesting scandal, to be uttered
with bated breath over the humble tea-tray, and to
give zest to the unassuming muffin in the back
parlours of small rustic shopkeepers. As it was,
thanks to Phoebe's admirable stolidity, all that was
known of Mrs. Porter's departure was that she had
gone to London by the early train on a certain morning,
and that her luggage had been sent after her,
address unknown.

It was the general opinion that Mrs. Porter had
had money left her, and that she had reassumed her
position in life as a genteel personage. This
afforded some scope for speculative gossip, but not
for a wide range of conjecture, and in less than a
month after Mrs. Porter's departure the only talk
in relation to the "West Lodge was the talk of who
would succeed the vanished lady as its occupant.

This thrilling question was promptly settled by the
removal of the head gardener and his wife from
their very commonplace abode in the village to the
old English cottage.

Cheriton was furnished with a more interesting
topic of discourse before the end of October, when
it was " given out " that Lord and Lady Cheriton
were going to winter abroad, an announcement
which struck consternation to a village in which
the great house was the centre of light and leading,
and the chief consumer of butcher's meat, farm
produce  over and above the supply from the
home-farm  and expensive groceries; not to mention
hardware, kitchen crockery, coals, saddlery,
forage, and odds and ends of all kinds. To shut
up Cheriton Chase for six months was to paralyse
trade in Cheriton.

To draw down the blinds and close the shutters
of the great house was to spread a gloom over the
best society in the neighbourhood, and to curtail the
weekly offertory by about one-third.

Everybody admitted, however, that his Lordship
had been looking ill of late. He had aged suddenly,

'* as those fine, well set-up men are apt to do,"
said Mr. Dolby, the doctor. He looked care-worn
and haggard. The village solicitor hoped that he
had not been dabbling with foreign loans  or had
invested blindly in the fortune of an impossible
canal  yet opined that nothing but the Stock
Exchange could make such a sudden change for the
worse in any man. Mr. Dolby declared that Lord
Cheriton's lungs were as sound as a bell, and that
if he were ordered abroad it was not on account of
his chest.

Everybody pitied her Ladyship, and talked of her
as despondingly as if it had been proposed to take
her to Botany Bay in the days of transportation for
felony. It was so cruel to separate her from her
flower-gardens, her hothouses, her poultry-yard, and
her daughter ; for all which things a correct British
matron was supposed to exist. To take her from
these placid domestic pleasures, from these strictly
lady-like interests, and to plunge her in a hotbed of
vice such as Monte Carlo  as pictured by the rustic
mind  would be a kind of moral murder. Cheriton
recovered its equanimity somewhat upon hearing

that his Lordship was going to winter at Mustapha
Superieure  but it was opine-i that even there
baccarat and Parisian morals would be in the
ascendant, and a photograph of a square in Algiers,
which looked like a bit broken off the Rue de Tivoli,
was bj no means reassuring.

Yet, whatever Dr. Dolby might say as to the
soundness of his lungs, there remained the fact that
his Lordship had altered for the worse since the
shooting season began. He who used to go oat
daily with the guns, had this year not gone with
them half-a-dozen times in the whole season. He
whose active habits and personal superintendence of
his estate had been the admiration of his neighbours
had taken to staying at home, dreaming over Horace
or Juvenal in the library.

Yes, Lord Cheriton was a broken man. From the
hour in which his daughter had laid her head upon
his breast, and sobbed out fond words of compassion
and forgiveness for the weakness and the sin that had
brought about her one great sorrow  from that hour
James Dalbrook's zest of life dwindled, and the things
that he had cared for pleased him no more. His

heart sickened as he rode his cob by the familiar
lanes, and surveyed wide-spreading corn-field and
undulating pasture  sickened at the thought of that
wretched creature whose dream he had darkened,
whose long-cherished hope he had ruthlessly disappointed.
The image of Evelyn Darcy, eating out
her heart in the dull monotony of a private madhouse,
came between him and that sunlit prospect,
haunted and tortured him wherever he turned his
eye. He had to give up the quiet morning rides
which had once been the most restful portion of the
day, his thinking hours, his time for leisurely discursive
meditations, for indulgence in happy thoughts
and humorous reverie.

His wife saw the change in him  knowing nothing
of the cause  and urged him to take advice.
He gratified her by seeing Sir William Jenner,
confessed to being fagged and out of spirits, and
obtained just the advice be wanted  complete change
of scene  a winter in Egypt or Algiers.

We'll try Algiers first, and if we don't like it
we can try the Nile," he said, and his wife, who
would have gone to Vancouver Island or Patagonia

VOL. III. X

just as cheerfully, forthwith ordered her trunks to be
packed, and began to take leave of her grandson,
an operation which would require weeks.

They left England in the middle of November,
just when the last leaves were being stripped from
the oaks and beeches by the blustering south-west
wind, which is a speciality in that part of the
country, where it comes salt with the bitter breath of
the sea, and sometimes thick and gray with sea
fog.

Mrs. Porter had been nearly three months at
Cheshunt Grange, and Theodore had been three
times to see her in that carefully-chosen retreat, and
on two of those visits had met her daughter Mercy,
who went to her twice a week.

He had found Dr. Main waring' s patient strangely
calm and tractable, professing herself contented with
her life, and having established her reputation
among the other patients as a lady of blameless
character' and reserved manners.

I sometimes wonder how they would feel if they
knew what I did that night,' ' she said to Theodore
once, with a sinister smile. " They think me a

common-place person. They call my complaint
nervous debility. Nobody here would believe me if
I were to tell them that I murdered a man who
never offended me by so much as an uncivil word.
They don't believe that such a deed as that would be
possible in our day, and in our country. They think
it was only a couple of centuries ago in Southern
Europe that women knew the meaning of revenge."

This was the solitary occasion on which she spoke
of her crime. On the other visits he found her
apathetic. Although she was elaborately polite, it
was evident that she did not recognise him. She
had, however, recognised her daughter, and now
received her with some faint show of tenderness,
but not without a touch of fretful impatience. It
was evident that Mercy's presence gave her no
pleasure.

**I go to see her as often as Dr. Mainwaring
allows me," Mercy told Theodore, as they walked to
the station together. *' It is all I can do  and it
is very little."

Have you thought any more of Lord Cheriton's
earnest desire to improve your position ? Have you

X 2

learnt to take pity upon him, to think more kindly
of him, on account of all he has suffered ? "

'' I am very sorry for him  but I can never accept
any favour at his hands. I can never forget what
my mother's life has been like, and who made her
what she is."

And is your own life to be always the same  a
monotony of toil ? "

"I am used to such a life  but I have some
thought of a change in my employment. I had
a long talk with your friend Mr. Ramsay last night
at Miss Newton's, and through his help I hope to
learn to be a sick-nurse. I should be of more use
to my fellow-creatures in that capacity than in
stitching at fine needlework for rich people's
children."

*' It would be a hard life, Mercy."
*' I am content to live a hard life. I had my
span of a soft life  a life of idleness on a summer
sea, amidst the loveliest spots upon earth  a life
that would have been like a glimpse of Heaven
itself, if it had not been for the consciousness of sin
and disgrace. Do you think I forget those days on

the Mediterranean, or forget that I have to atone for
them ? The man I loYecl is dead  all that belonged
to that life has vanished like a dream."

They parted at the railway station, she to go to
her place in a dusty third-class carriage, he to a
smoking carriage to smoke the meditative pipe, and
think sadly of those two blighted lives which had
been ground beneath the wheels of Lord Cheriton's
triumphal car.

Cheriton Chase was deserted, the blinds down,
the servants on board wages, the flower-beds empty
and raked over for the winter ; but at Milbrook Priory
all was life and movement. The sisters and their
husbands were again established in their favourite
rooms. Lady Jane was again at hand to assist her
daughter-in-law to bear the burden of a family party,
and all was much as it had been in the previous
winter, except that Juanita had a new interest in
life, and was able to take pleasure in many things
that had been an oppression to her spirits last year.

Most of all were her feelings altered towards Mrs.
Grenville and her nursery. She was now warmly

interested in the history of Johnnie's measles, and
deeply sympathetic about that constitutional tendency
towards swollen tonsils which was dear little Lucy's
** weak point." For must not her Godfrey inevitably
face the ordeal of measles, and might not his
tonsils show a like weakness at the growing age ?
All those discussions about nursery dinners  the
children who fed well and the children who fed badly
those who liked milk puddings and those who
could not be induced to touch them  the advisability
of a basin of cornflour or bread-and-milk at bedtime,
the murderous influence of buns and pastry, and the
lurking dangers of innocent-seeming jam  all these
things, to hear of which last year bored her almost
to exasperation, were now vital and spirit-moving
questions.

The little visitors' nurseries were near the infant
Sir Godfrey' s rooms, and it was a delight to find the
baby taking pleasure in his youthful cousins' society,
and revelling in their noise. His own young lungs
revealed their power and scope as they had never
done before, and led the infant orchestra. Juanita
spent hours in this noisy society, sitting on the floor

to be crawled over by her sou  who was just beginning
to discover the possibility of independent locomotion
and to have her hair pulled affectionately by the
younger Grenvilless, who found her the most accommodating
playfellow. She insisted that the children
should dine at the family luncheon table, much to
the gratification of their mother and grandmother,
and to the exasperation of Mrs. Morningside, who,
having left her own children with their conscientious
governess and nurses, in the North of England, did
not see why her mid-day meal should be made intolerable
by the boisterous egotism of her nephews
and nieces.

This was the condition of things at Christmas
when Theodore reappeared at the Priory, having
come to Dorchester for his holidays, after three
months' earnest work. He had been reading with a
man of some distinction at the Chancery Bar, and
he had been writing for one of the Law Journals.
He was struck by the change in his cousin. She
looked younger, brighter, and happier than she had
ever looked since her husband's death. No one
could accuse her of having forgotten him, of having

grown indifferent to his memory, for at the least allusion
which recalled his image her expression clouded,
and her eyes grew sad. But there could be no doubt
that the dawn of a happier existence was beginning to
disperse the darkness of her night of grief. The
influence of her child had done much ; the solution
of the mystery of her husband's death had done
more to relieve her mind of its burden. She was no
longer tortured by wonder ; her thoughts were no
longer forced to travel perpetually along the same
groove. She knew the worst, and pity for her father
prompted her to try to forget the wretch who had
blighted her young life.

She received Theodore with all her old kindness,
with that easy cordiality which was of all indications
the most hopeless for the man who loved her. She
took him to the nurseries, where Christmas fires
blazed merrily, and Christmas gifts strewed the
carpet, a plethora of toys, a litter of foil paper and
gold and silver fringe, and tissue-paper cocked hats
and Pierrot caps, from the wreck of cracker bonbons.
The children were masters of the situation in this
Christmas week.

*' It is their season," said Juanita tenderly. *'I
don't think we can ever do too much to make our
children happy at this time, remembering that He
who made the season sacred was once a little child."

She took her baby up in her arms as she spoke,
and pressed the little face lovingly against her own.

*' Why does Mr. Ramsay never come to see me ? "
she asked with a sudden lightness of tone. " He
used to be so fond of baby."

He is working hard at the hospital."

'* And is he not to have any holiday with you ? "

*' I fear not."

Her manner in making the inquiry, light as it
was, told him so much ; and he noticed how she
bent her face over the child's flaxen head as she
talked of Ramsay.

Why does he work so hard '? " she asked, after a
silence.

He has never given me any reason, yet I have
my own idea about his motive."

And what is your idea ? "

Have you ever heard of a man trying to live
down a hopeless attachment  trying to medicine a

mind diseased with the strong physic of intellectual
labour. That is my case, Juanita ; and I am inclined
to think that it may be Kamsay's case too.
He has altered curiously within the last few months.
I cannot get so near his inner-self as I used to get ;
but I know him well enough to form a shrewd
opinion."

"I am sorry for you both," she said, with a little
nervous laugh, still hiding her face against the baby's
incipient curls and wrinkled pink skin. "I am
sorry you should be so sentimental."

Sentimental, Nita ! Is it sentimental to cherish
one love for the best part of a lifetime, knowing
that love to be hopeless all the time ? If that is your
idea of sentimentality, I confess myself sentimental.
I have loved you ever since I knew the meaning of
the word love  and I have gone on loving you in
spite of every discouragement. I loved you when
your love was given to another. Yes, I stood aside
and harboured not one malevolent thought against
the man you had so blest and honoured. I have
loved you in your sorrow, as I loved you years ago
in your light-hearted girlhood. I shall love you till

I am dust ; but I know that my love is hopeless.
Your very kindness  in its level uniformity of sweetness
 has told me that."

Dear Theodore, if you knew how I value you 
how I admire and respect you  I think you would
be content to accept my sisterly regard," she said,
looking up at him with tearful eyes. *' Perhaps, had
we met differently, as strangers, I might have felt
differently  but from my earliest remembrance you
have been to me as a friend and brother. I cannot
teach myself any other love."

Ah, Nita, that other love comes untaught. You
want no teaching to love Cuthbert Ramsay. Don't be
angry ! I can't help speaking of that which has been
in my mind so long. I saw my doom in your face
when Cuthbert was here. I saw that he could interest
you as I had never interested you. I saw that
he brought fresh thoughts and fancies into your life.
I saw that he could conquer where I was beaten."

You have no right to say that."

"I have the right that goes with conviction,
Juanita, and with disinterested love. I have the
right of my loyal friendship for the man who has

shown himself loyal to me. Unless you or I make
some sign to prevent him, Cuthbert Kamsay will
have made himself an exile from this country before
the new year is a month old."

What do you mean, Theodore ? "

I mean that he is in treaty with the leader of a
scientific expedition to the Antarctic Ocean. The
ships will be away three years, and if he join that
expedition as doctor he will be absent for that
time, with the usual hazard of being absent forever."


"Why is he going?"

*' He has never given me any reason, but I suspect
that the reason is you."

*' Theodore ! "

"If I read his secret right, he left this place
deeply in love with you. He knew I loved you, and
that was one reason for a man of his generous
temper to withdraw. You are rich and he is poor,
that makes another reason. He is too honourable to
come between his friend and his friend's love. He
is too proud to offer himself with only his talents
and his unfulfilled ambition to a woman of fortune.

So he takes his old mistress Science for his comforter,
and is going to the other side of the world to watch
the planets in the Polar skies, and to keep the crew
free of fever and scurvY, if he can."

Three years," faltered Juanita. *' It would not
be so Very long anywhere else  hut those Polar
expeditions so often end in deaths."

'' Shall I tell him not to go?"

spray do."

"I'm afraid I shall hardly prevail with him, unless
"

'unless what?"

Unless you will let me say that you wish him to
stay."

She blushed deepest crimson, and again had resource
to the baby's pink little head as a hiding-place
for her confusion.

Tell him anything you like. Ask him to come
and romp with the children next Easter. He is fond
of children, and I am sure he would like my nephews
and nieces. Ah Theodore," she cried, holding
out her hand, '' now you are indeed my brother.
Forget that you ever wished to be more, and let

me hear of your having found a new love by-and-by."


By-and-by is easily said, Juanita'*

What would that by-and-by have revealed could
the curtain of the Future have been lifted that
Christmas Eve, as the children danced in the
shadowy room while their elders sat beside the fire
in the winter dusk ? A coffin brought by land and
sea, and laid with stately ceremonial in the cemetery
at Dorchester. A respectful obituary notice
of Lord Cheriton, with a laudatory biography, setting
forth his remarkable gifts and his honourable
career : much wonderment among his Lordship's
friends at the premature termination of that prosperous
life  a man of sixty who had looked ten
years younger, and whose vigorous constitution and
grand bearing had denoted one of the semi-immortals
 a Brougham, a Lyndhurst, or a St.
Leonard.

What else ? A lovely matron, proud of her
handsome Scotch husband and his scientific successes,
reigning over one of the most delightful

houses in London, a house in which the brightest
lights of the intellectual world are to be found shining
in a congenial atmosphere. Sir Godfrey Carmichael's
widow, now Cuthbert Ramsay's wife, and
one of the leaders in all movements that tend towards
the welfare and enlightenment of mankind.

What else ? A rising barrister, living quietly ina
secluded old house at Chadwick, with a sweet
serious-looking 'ttdfe, and two lovely babies, supremely
contented with his lot and with his home, which is
managed for him with that perfection of art which
conceals art. His wife and he are of exactly the
same age, have the same deep love of good books,
good pictures, and good music, and the same indifference
to frivolous pleasures and fashionable
amusements. They have a few friends, carefully
chosen, and of choicest quality, and amongst the
most honoured of these is Sarah Newton, still brisk
and active, though her abundant hair is snow white,
and there are the deep lines of age about her shrewd
and kindly eyes. They have their garden with its
old cedars, and old walls shutting off the world of
gig-and-villa respectability. They have their boathouse

and boats, in which they live for the most parton
summer evenings, and they have hardly anything
left to wish for  except a lock and weir.

The barrister is Theodore Dalbrook, and his wife's
name is Mercy.

He found her four years ago established as nurse
at Cheshunt Grange, administering to her mother
till the day of her death, which happened by a
strange fatality within a few hours of that other
death in Algiers, a sudden death by cerebral apoplexy,
swift as a thunder-clap. He found her there,
and saw her frequently in his duty visits to the
Asylum  visits paid in performance of a promise to
his unhappy kinsman  and little by little that sympathy
which he had felt for her in the first hour of
their acquaintance warmed and ripened into love, and
in Mercy, the woman who had sinned and paid the
bitter penalty of sin, he found the consoling angel of
Lis disappointed youth.

The world knows nothing of her story. That dead
past is buried deeper than ever ship went down into
the treacherous waters of the tideless sea. To Mercy
herself, in her plenitude of domestic bliss, it seems

as if it was another woman who shed those bitter
tears and drank that cup of shame. The world
knows only that Theodore Dalbrook has a lovely and
devoted wife, who thoroughly understands and
realises the duties of her position.

Lord Cheriton's will, executed three months
before his death at Mustapha Supervene, bequeathed
a life interest in the sum of i;20,000 Consols
to Sarah Newton, spinster, the principal to
go to Mercy Darcy  otherwise Mercy Porter  upon
that lady's death.
