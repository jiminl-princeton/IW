VOL. III.

We have one element that makes fo' peace ; and another's
element that makes fo' strife  ; but, my-de'-seh, the peace element
is that which ought to make the strife, and the strife
element is that which ought to be made to keep the peace.' 
Geo. "W. Cable.

My-de'-seh, you mus' crack the egg, not smash it.'  Ibid,

The next day came the first letter from Eene.
What a rush of conflicting emotions swept
through Bethesda's mind at the sight of the
familiar writing and crest. Delight, poignant
memories, satisfaction, and trembling uncertainty,
were all finally engulfed in a deep and
sure tenderness.

She took the letter into her own room to read.
It was written while he was still in Liverpool,
and when he was in the full surge of a passionate
grief which swept him ofi" his feet. To the

woman, struggling for pure light, for equipoise,
and stainless chastity, it was inexpressibly painful.
Alas ! that this should be the letter written
when he was most vividly under her influence !

Mabel had heard that Beth had received a
foreign letter, and came in to see it. Her face
was accusing and obdurate. Nothing, Bethesda
knew by experience, could possibly please her
then. But of course the letter, the knowable
letter, had to be given her ; and Bethesda did
not conceal that there was one enclosed. The
whole affair made Mabel excessively angry. She
had been duped and cheated, and there was noway
in which she could indemnify herself. She
could not break off the correspondence, because
it was already broken, and before the time came
for resuming it Bethesda would be of age and
independent. She tried to get the girl to say
she would not read any of the letters from Eene
that came before his answer to her steamer letter ;
but all requests on this head were steadily refused.

Still, Bene had taken his strongest advocate
away in robbing himself of Bethesda's approval.
The torrent of anger and abused feeling, which
Mabel gave more force by somewhat striving to
control, found the dykes of Bethesda's precious
land already partially undermined. But she
made a loyal defence, and worked hard to draw
the tide towards her own delinquencies  where
the land was less precious  instead of Eene's.
She was not very successful. Had not Mabel
reared Bethesda from her cradle ? Did she not
know every tendency of the girl, as though her
soul had been crystal ? Was it any education of
hers that had fostered concealment and deceit ?
Had she not always been frank as the day herself,
and brought up Beth to revere frankness ?
She scorned the idea that her niece, her darling,
had been most to blame in this unworthy affair !
She had been tempted, been beguiled in the
Eden of her innocence, and Bene, whom she, the
too fond Mabel, had trusted, was the odious serpent

! Well, not quite that, perhaps. Some
sense of fairness still slumbering under the
tumultuous swerving of lier nature turned uneasily
in its sleep, and site smoothed the pillows
by granting that it might be he was an Adam 
the wicked Adam ! who at all costs must be
driven out of the heaven of her niece's heart.

When Bethesda emerged from that conversation
she looked exhausted to an alarming degree.
Margaret felt a smouldering fire of resentment
against Mrs. Trescott for treating Beth in such a
manner when she was already miserable in health ;
but she said nothing.

Agatha, as usual, acted. She drew Beth
down on the lounge, ordered some iced wine, and
then, when the two girls were sipping and talking
easily, she slipped away for a moment, and
was gone an hour in Mrs. Trescott's room.

But Mabel was not amenable to reason or
prudence. She hated that word ! she must be
frank ; she would be frank with Beth if it cost

her lier life, or any one's ! Then, less excitedly,
but with a great air of determination, she told
her sister that this matter, that Beth, must be
left absolutely to her. She would brook no interference
in an affair of which she alone knew
the importance, and which she alone could
manage. She knew what she was doing, and
she knew, Dieu salt ! what she had failed to do.
She was not croino to make that mistake ao;ain.
It is possible,' here said Agatha, ' that you

are trying to repair past errors by a greater one

now '

That only proves how little you know about

it,' interrupted Mabel.

I know this, at least : Beth is not strong

enough to endure what she is now undergoing,

and yet she has a character which will not pelt

to importunity. Between the two her body will

be mangled.'

There are some things of more value than

health or life even. And as to importunity.

didn't Christ himself say that we should even
importune God when we wished what was right V

'He certainly in no place told us to coerce
others to do as we thought right. That is a
doctrine which made the Inquisition. Look toit,
Mabel, that you do not work more harm than
good. If it is a question of honour, as I judge
from your words  wait a minute, please ; let me
finish  remember that there are three thousand
miles between her and Europe. Moreover, if
you are afraid they will be crossed, leave Beth
with Ealeigh and me. I will warrant you no one
can harm her then 1'

No,' exclaimed Mabel quickly ;  no one can
do anything for her but I myself. It isn't
enemies without but enemies within that I fear.
And yet there is not a thought of harm in her !
She is deceived ! deceived ! I must and will
protect her. You know nothing about it ; you
must leave me alone.'

She is like her mother,' said Agatha. * You

may coiL\T.nce lier, or yon may kill lier; yoii
never can force lier. And she is not in a physical
condition to bear argument now. Can t you see
that she is worn out, just ready to be ill ? If
you compel her to endure such scenes as this
she has had to-day you must be prepared for
disastrous consequences. If you temporise you
may help both body and mind.'

Temporise !' cried Mabel, starting up almost
with a shriek ; ' temporising has been a poisoned
dagger to her ! Every instant it remains in her
flesh it becomes more dangerous ! It shall be
pulled out ! Doesn't the Bible say : ' It is better
to go into heaven maimed than with two hands
to be cast into hell-fire ?" I tel you, you know
nothing about it. And yet she is as pure as an
angel !'

Agatha saw the worse than uselessness of
more words, and left her. She was amazed, even
astounded, at the condition of her sister, and
with every word that had been spoken she had

realised more the imperative need of Beth's being
separated from Mabel for a while. But low
could it be accomplished ? Mabel, she perceived,
was extremely jealous, and would allow no one
to exert any influence counteractive to her own.
It would be impossible to overcome this Agatha
clearly saw. The next best thing would be for
them to be altogether, where she could screen
Beth somewhat ; and, indeed, as she had long
since planned, on grounds of pleasure alone.

The household was not so congenial, with
Mabel fretting against the heat and laying Bethesda's
tired appearance all to that, for plans to
be long delayed.

I don't see why we shouldn't go tomorrow,'
exclaimed Mabel. ' It is blistering here.'

Where do you think of going ? '

Oh, I don't know. There are plenty of
places. The Catskills, the AUeghanies, the
White Mountains.'

How would you like the Rocky Mountains ?

It will be something new to you both, and it is
well worth seeing. Ealeigh and I are expecting
to go in a short time now.'

Oh, you couldn't induce me ! I abhor the
west. The east may be endurable ; I am sure I
hope so ; but deliver me from this rough, ugly
western life ! And it must be a great deal worse
out so far.'

Agatha quietly explained the advantages and
pleasures of Colorado,  the grand scenery, and
curiosity of ]pioneer civilisation. She also remarked
that the dry air there would probably
invigorate Beth as nothing else could do. It
would be a complete change for her, and would
benefit Margaret as well. They could make a
pleasant family party if they all liked it.

Of course it would be charming for us all to
be together,' said Mabel; but,' conclusively,
you see I hate the west. Why don't you come
with us ? There is fishing and hunting east, no
doubt.'

Ealeigh. has found that there is none worth
seeking,' interposed Agatha, studying her sister
keenly.

'Well,' exclaimed Mabel, with a toss of her
head, * I don't know why we should all go where
it will best suit one man. It hasn't been my
habit to let others dictate my actions, and, for
my part, I had rather be alone than not go east.'

'You certainly have a great love of places,'
remarked Agatha, with controlled satire. 'But
how about the health question ? Physicians
have told me repeatedly that it would be excellent
for Margaret, and probably it would be the
best thing to be done for Beth.'

Oh, they are not in the least alike. I have
heard, too, that rare air is very dangerous for
heart troubles. I don't think it would be right
at all to risk it. I never would consent to it.'

She seemed to consider the matter quite
settled by this, but Agatha had no thought of
yielding to so flimsy a reason.

Have her heart examined and leave it to the
physician,' she said, a trifle shortly.

She never would consent to that, and if she
did, I have no confidence in physicians. They
are miserably ignorant.'

It is possible, however, that they may know
more than we, since they devote their lives to
the study of medicine,' replied Agatha, and let
the subject drop.

Later she called Bethesda aside and asked her
if she would object to having her heart examined.
Beth shrank from it, and Agatha
explained her reasons.

Oh, if you think Margaret needs Colorado,
let us go without minding me,' said Bethesda
eagerly.

I think it would be as good for you as for
Margaret if your heart is sound; but, dear, I
don't wish you to run any risk.'

I confess I would rather not know the state
of my heart,' said Bethesda at last.

 Why not?'

'Because  well, it has troubled me some of
late, and '

That is sufficient reason in itself, then, why
you should have it examined. Be reasonable,
dear. I could always appeal with confidence to
your reason when you were a child. If you
think about it calmly you will see that you
should have all the light you can. It is never
well to hide our eyes for fear of what we may
see, nor did it ever use to be your way.'

Bethesda was ' reasonable,' and an hour later
Mrs. Stanhope was always expeditious  a
physician somewhat celebrated for his treatment
of heart troubles appeared. He inquired minutely
into Miss Hamilton's heredity, looked grave
on hearing of the circumstances of her mother's
death, made his examination, and studied on the
case.

Mrs. Stanhope took him into the next room
to hear his opinion, and Bethesda was left palpitating

more with, hope than fear. Heart disease !
that would mean that any sudden shock or long
strain would kill her. Life need not be prolonged
beyond the loss of hope and love. Incase
of the worst, death would relieve her.

They returned.

Have I heart disease V asked Bethesda, looking
up in the physician's face with a peculiarly
bright smile. It was as if she had asked : Can
I really be happy soon ?

He stood and looked doTvn at her half a
minute before he answered.

No he said then slowly, and he saw her
face fall. ' No, you have not heart disease, but
you have a functional disorder which will terminate
in organic trouble if you are not extremely
careful. You know neither one nor the other
means death. You should understand clearly
that heart disease means suffering much more
frequently than it does death. If you are like
your aunt here, that will make it more emphatic

to you when I say you must avoid all strong
emotions and all excitement. You must lead a
lazy life, think little, take tonics, and live in the
open air. If you do this you will perhaps escape
the disease.'

She glanced at him, and away, with an incredulous
smile trembling around her sad lips.
To tell her she must avoid emotion, excitement,
thought, and in her present circumstances 1 He
read her better than she guessed, however, and
he appreciated the hopelessness of that smile.

'And you said about Colorado?' suggested
Mrs. Stanhope.

She had better try no experiments. It
might help and might injure her ; I would not
undertake to say which. I should advise her
going to the seashore, or not very high among
the White Mountains.'

He turned to bow profoundly as he bade them
good-morning, and gave another keen glance at
his patient. She interested him as a curiosity.

The fortitude and mobility that mingled in her
face indicated how foolish his advice must seem to
her. He knew it was foolish too, and yet it was
true. Probably if he ever saw her again, it
would be in the clutches of an incurable agony.

So Mrs. Trescott had it her own way. Mrs.
Stanhope was seriously concerned for Beth, but
did not see her way to doing anything for her at
present. It was hard for her to be inactive, and
to this was added the shock of finding Mabel
insensible to old ties, when her own heart had
ached for the far-away sister, her nearest relative.
Domestic love made the very warp of her nature,
and each thread had to be pulled out with persistent
effort before she could or would relinquish
the band of rich colour each loved person wove
into her life. She had not now the slightest
intention of giving up her sister, but would
patiently wait and work  waiting always meant
working with her  to the end of a complete
recovery.

VOL. III. c

h

Mabel herself was much shocked in discovering
Beth's critical condition. Mrs. Stanhope
told her quite plainly, not sparing the details
and prognosis. She wished to impress Mabel with
the necessity of avoiding these exciting discussions,
and Mabel was quite sufficiently impressed,
for the time at least. She went to Beth, and put
her arms about her, and begged her to take care
of herself, to spare herself these wearying questions,
to put them all away by simply agreeing
to the year's silence, and then waiting until she
was stronger before she thought them out. But
when she found Bethesda unshaken in her resolution
to guide her own soul, to do as she thought
right, come what might, then Mabel asked herself
how she was to do anything when Beth would
not consent ? How could she shield her niece from
bodily terrors when her soul was in the clutches
of evil, and she alone could loosen the grasp ?

They remained in S but a few days longer,

and then went over the long dusty road east

again. It was a silly thing, in Mabel's opinion,
their ever having gone west. Business could have
been attended to some other time just as welland
this was an unnecessary expense and fatigue.
As to pleasure, what pleasure could there be in
going back and forth over this rough railroad,
through the scorching land ?

Margaret was silent when such things were
said, and Bethesda was too weary to argue, nor
would it have done any good if she had. To
fight with a windmill was nothing to fighting
with Mrs. Trescott's variable opinions.

Moreover, Bethesda's whole strength was
strained in solving the questions daily, hourly,
thrust in on her attention. It was an appalling
change that had come to her. The complete
difference in mental and moral atmosphere between
the old world and the new, altered every
glimpse of every fact that Bethesda saw. Her
position was changed, and her past and present
and future had all fallen into chaos together. If

the central part of the universe were suddenly-removed
to its outer circumference, the stars and
planets would not fly more wildly through space
than did the shattered thoughts of Bethesda's
mental system.

Mrs. Trescott also felt it, and the confusion it
engendered was proved by her saying to Beth once :

I believe you never could have endured this
coming to America and its influences if I had not
known. You would have had brain fever ; there
is no doubt of it.'

I do not think so,' said Bethesda ; nor did
she at any time. Her aunt's knowledge of the
affair only thwarted and exhausted her ; more
within even than without. Had Mrs. Trescott
not known more than when Rene left them, it
doubtless would have been hard,  the struggle,
the awakening, would inevitably have come, 
but it would have been less hard for Bethesda
than now, when she felt her aunt's incessant
pushing weight behind her, and the watching

that made each throe observed, and computed as
so much done or undone. She sometimes felt
it to be absolutely unbearable, and she would
have given the world for a little privacy, for an
instant blank of scrutinising eyes. To be alone
at times is a vital necessity to those in great
trouble. There are sacred moments when the
dearest cannot intrude without causing pain, and
they often are the hours of travail when the
priceless gift of peace is born.

So Bethesda, with the instinct of self-preservation,
avoided being alone with her aunt, and
this was easier to do since Margaret accompanied
them for their summer east, and the sisters of
course were almost constantly together. Margaret
was taking now the undisputed place of a
loved child to Bethesda. She was really the
elder, and yet Beth was always the one to be
addressed as Miss Hamilton, and given, without
hesitation, the position of eldest.

There was an innocence and simplicity about

Margaret wliicli was essentially childlike, and her
petite figure and extreme fairness aided the
appearance of youth. Her hair was like a tangle
of sunbeams, not golden, but recalling the morning
light while the shadows are yet long : her
delicately-finished eyebrows, arched over 'myrtle-eyes,'
as Bethesda called them, which were capable
of much passion, as well as a steely glitter
when displeased. Generally, however, she was
gentle and sweet. She reminded one, indeed, of
a virgin by Raphael, and possessed the mystic
devotion and absorption in higher things which,
combined with purity, may have been the traits
of Mary.

She clung to Bethesda as to one for whom
alone life was worth living, and yet held her ina
large enough embrace for her to be able to turn
freely in it : even to turn away at times, and
yet, upon return, to find the same warm light
in the tender eyes. But this capacity for devotion
only balanced an irritability of judgment

wliicli might otherwise have been stern, perhaps
merciless. Had any one done wrong, whether
Margaret loved much or little, the love she had
given would swiftly return into her own bosom,
although it might force life out in the process.
An absolute incapacity for worshipping a fallen
idol made her look upon another who did so with
nothing more pitiful than a stare of amazement.
Yet if one did wrong, and repented in act, her
forgiveness would be full and obliterating, and
one would have considered the effort made to
obtain it well spent. She would help, she would
try to help, neither one nor the other of these
instincts. Her whole character was so built on
this fatality of cause and effect that to conceive
anything else in herself was impossible,  more,
indifferent to her. AYorth and love went together
with her ; reciprocation would have been of little
consequence, so that her ideal remained intact.
That fallen, and the pride which was inherent in
her would have lifted her above all possibility of

kneeling in the dust to pick up and piece together
the fragments, and fancy it was as perfect
as before. A dent in the sword of life was
always a dent to her ; there was no compromise
or illusion about that ; but it might be rendered
ignoble or glorious as defeat or victory followed.
If defeat, the sword was broken, and useless to
her ; if victory, she would have been capable of
sheathing it in her own heart, could such a deed
protect it from injury.

And this was the woman who now nestled
close to Bethesda's side, and encompassed her
with an unobtrusive tenderness. Her unsuspicious
exterior and intelligent confidence tranquillised
Bethesda unspeakably, and she felt a
great gratitude growing in her heart which made
her little sister hourly more precious.

The three left New York for the White Mountains
on a shady afternoon in midsummer. As
the hills appeared, and seemed to increase in
height, they were seen through a shimmer of

opal, that rendered their blue tints soft and
ethereal.

Mabel was in raptures.

Just to be east again is a joy to me ! And
look at those hills ; why, one could almost fancy
we were going; to see the Italian lakes ! Alas !
for la bella Italia !'

It is hardly like Italy said Bethesda. ' One
never sees the violets, purples, and amethystine
shades in America. Here it is a deep, true,
perfect blue. It is like a clarion note that never
changes into any other, but only grows surer and
fuller as it increases.'

You speak as if you liked it better,' said
Margaret. She herself longed for Italy.

'No, not better,' answered Bethesda slowly.
There is something steadfast and reliant about
it, but the tenderness and loveliness of Italy
do not belong to us. Browning would call
this, I suppose, a masculine land, and Italy feminine.
I think Mrs. Eandleth described the

difference better, when she said that Italy was
like a lover and England like a husband.'

What queer fancies that woman had ! ' exclaimed
Mabel.

'Poetic ones, I should say,' returned Margaret,
with interest. 'Tell me more about
her.'

If you once get Beth on that subject, you
will never get her off!' said Mabel. 'I'll
leave ! '

In spite of this remark, and perhaps because
of Mrs. Trescott's move to the other side of the
car, and her novel, Margaret succeeded in leading
Bethesda into a frank description of her friend,
and, almost before she was aware, Beth found
herself talking with ease of all her friends, and
frequently mentioning M. d'Isten.

What is he like ? ' asked Margaret at last.
You have spoken very little of him, yet he was
quite intimate apparently.' 

Yes, he was a warm friend of both auntie's

and mine replied Betliesda, commanding her
voice.

Aunt Mabel does not speak of him much.'

No ; they had a misunderstanding just at
the last, but I hope it will be satisfactorily explained.'


You like him very much, then V

1 admire him, and honour him,' replied
Bethesda, with a proud steadiness.

Tell me about him ; what kind of a man is
he ? ' said Margaret simply, and Bethesda chose
tempered words, and wandered back through the
flowery fields of her life before the denouement,
hand-in-hand nth this pure-hearted sister.

It has been told us by a man who knew the
human soul marvellously well, that to remember
happiness in grief is our greatest misery, but
there do come hours when what made the past
radiant is lost for ever, and yet its remembrance
is our sole light; as, when the sun is set, its
reflection on the moon is all that relieves us from

black darkness. Bethesda found herself in this
moonlit land to-day, and it was a sweet, fine
pleasure to her. It seemed to lift the stigma of
confusion and possible dishonour off from her
soul, in returning thus to those surely innocent
hours in Florence, in their dear Italy.

As she talked, the sunset tinged rosily the
mist which still lingered in the atmosphere,
gathering and dissolving in ever-varied forms
and colours. The wooded slopes, the towering
crags, the lofty peaks, were all suffused by this
transparent blush, which came and went with a
shy waywardness, of itself indescribably lovely.
On every side soft clouds clung with white arms
to the stalwart necks of the rocks, or lay trembling
on the bosom of the hills. Little streams
rushed down impetuously to mingle with the
calmer river, while above arched the heavens,
luminous with amber and gold, amidst which
shone a brighter point, the evening star.

The dreamy monologue melted into this landscape

and became a part of it, as silence fell at
last. Margaret was impressed with she knew
not what unselfish sadness, and Bethesda felt
refreshed and sweetened by the aspect of these
everlasting hills clad in the colours of love and
truth.

Chapter lY.

Growth is the condition of love, as it is of life.'

In things evil there is a soul of goodness, and reformation
consists, not in annihilating the evil thing, but in developing
that soul of goodness within it, which gives it life and vigour,
and in directing it to the good which it erringly seeks.' 
Simpson's Philosophy of Shakespeare's Sonnets.

The summer passed in alternations of conflict,
victory, and despair. Every letter of Eene's,
written before he could receive hers, marked an
era; for Bethesda's was one of those natures
whose roots strike deep, clear their own way,
and win the light by growing.' She was not a
person who could rest with an unsolved doubt,
implying wrong action, in her mind. It was an
ever-present goad to her; it pricked her on to
indefatigable thought and ceaseless searching.
Sometimes she tottered under the weight she

carried, and yearned for some sure support until
she tliouo'bt lier soul would die for the want of
it. There must be something outside and beyond
herself, or Eene, or her aunt, or any one, and
this must be  what else could it be ?  the right.

And then a vivid remembrance would come to
her of how on shipboard Eene had said, with
long pauses between each phrase, and a strange
foresight in his eyes :

Mv Esda will trust me always : if I am old, 
or ugly,  or ill,  or unhajDjy,  or wicked '

No,' she had interrupted, ' not that.'

Not that, then,' he repeated, yet hardly seeming
to notice the interruption, 'or poor,  or cross,
or distant,  she will always, always trust me.'

Later, he had said that it hurt him at first to
think she would not trust herself to him were he
wicked, that her affection would not be inalienable
under no matter what circumstances ; but
now he knew she was right ; he must be always
worthy.

Otherwise you would not be yourself,' she had
said.  You would not be the noble Eene I have
known, and I could not transfer my confidence
from the real You to that unknown one

The same, she thought now, would apply to
herself. They would each be worthy, no matter
what the cost. She must not desert him a
moment. If she were unsatisfied, she must
think what she would have him do, so as to
be able to adequately help him when the time
came.

Presently this earnest thought brought its
sure result. The blindness fell from her eyes asa
veil that is dropped. One thing was settled :
Eene must belong all to Louise. Bethesda could
only claim him, or write to him as a friend, or asa
co-labourer. Nothing more could be thought
of. This was one rock under her feet.

And it remained a solid rock in spite of the
wild waves of passion which surged over her at
night, when she felt the presence of Eene near

lier, and in trouble. She would have given a
whole life of happiness for the power to annihilate
time and space, and comfort him then. But the
doubly-woven curtain hung stiff between him
and her, and she could only beat herself against
the unyielding folds with impotent despair.

Then there came the consoling thought that
the answer to her letter was yet to come. He
would show himself strong in that, and support
her. And finally one rainy day, suddenly illumined,
it came ! The last !

It was very long ; in fact a diary, as Bethesda
had expected. Perhaps in other things her suppositions
as to what its contents would be had
not been wrong ; but still it threw her on to her
own feet as nothing else had done.

She saw that she could not depend on him to
help her ; all the strength of denial must come
from her ; all the earnest seeking and truth-compelling
thought. He would follow where
she led ; this was the utmost she could expect of

VOL. III. D

him now. They could no longer judge each by
the other. There was one side of her nature to
which she must recognise that he did not respond.
Where was it, she asked herself quickly, that she
did not answer him ?

However, the writing under the same dates
in their journals proved their difference. On one
day she wrote that she must do her utmost to
reinstate him in his highest self-esteem ; while
he, far from his self-esteem having been lowered
by their intercourse, wrote :  ' Thy glance ennobles
me. Thou personified my duty, my
honour, my conscience, and something even more
than these. Thou raises me above myself If thou
shouldst abandon me, what would I become V

When she felt an icy hand on her heart in
seeing the first effect of her letter was dead
silence, his heart was burning within him, and he
cried : ' There is no law, no distance, no malignity
capable of sundering us ! '

What gave her confidence in being able to

help him to see the right and do it were such
sentences as these :  If I leave thee, it would be
replacing joy by suffering ; I acknowledge I have
not the courage except as thou desires it.' And
again : ' I resign myself to my fate, whatsoever
it may be, if Bethesda imposes it upon me. Any
other hand I defy I '

She must cro alone from the seductive waves,
must set her feet firmly on the shore, and thence
help him. She would save him if he were passive,
which she had confidence he would be. Perhaps,
later, he might even help her. She took up the
double burden without regret, but with a yearning
patience, and a loneliness she had never felt
so deeply before. But she was resolute. It
should be her life's work to win him to the sight
of truth and duty. Through her he had fallen ;
if through her he could gain a higher standpoint,
by force of having met and conquered a great
temptation, she would feel her life well spent.
If he failed ?  She could never forgive herself.

In the evening of the day the letter came,
parts of which Bethesda had read to her aunt,
through which she learned that her request had
been refused, Mrs. Trescott appeared in a black
dress, unrelieved by any colour, and took occasion
to say to Beth :

This is the death ; there only remains now
the funeral.'

Bethesda drew herself up proudly, with a flash
of disdain for her only reply. In pushing him
off thus cruelly Mabel had but thrust him closer
to Bethesda, and :

 I shall not desert him,' she told herself.

Come into my room,' said Mrs. Trescott
sharply, maddened by that expression on her
niece's face. ' I see you approve of that cowardly,
sneaking letter ! ' she burst out, as soon as the
door was closed; but Bethesda shut down the
flood-gates right there, standing regally in the
centre of the apartment.

Aunt Mabel,' she said, ' I shall not listen to

invectives against any one ; certainly not against
Eene. If you have nothing else to say, I shall
ask you to excuse me.'

Oh, it's very fine for you to be so proud with
me I But sit clown ; I must talk to you. Don't
you see, cm'it you see, that Eene hasn't one impulse
of veracity, not one moment of remorse for
having spoiled your life '

He has not spoiled it.'

I say he lias ! Every one notices it  notices
how much you are changed ; I notice it more than
all. You don't care for me a quarter, no, not a
tenth part as much as you did, and it is all because
of Eene ; while I lie awake nights, and tire
myself to death to think out an escape from the
dangers around your path.'

I am sorry.'

Mabel came and knelt doom beside Bethesda,
and put her arms around the girl's waist.

darling,' she pleaded, 'you are being worn
out with this struggle, and a gulf is widening

between you and me. I can't bear it. I would
be so glad to suffer all for you, but I cannot.
You will not even let yourself be guided
by me. I want to help you more than you
can know. I don't feel as if I could meet
your mother in heaven with this load upon my
soul '

It is no fault of yours exclaimed Beth.

Yes, it is ; partially at least. I should not
have trusted either of you. I ought to have
known that I could see clearer than you. I ought
to have had more confidence in myself. I have
helped to undo you, and I have now a duty I owe
to myself to reinstate you. Think of me a little,
Beth. Don't let all your sympathy go out towards
him ; I am suffering too.'

'Dear auntie !' murmured Bethesda. But her
position was now unendurable. She loosened her
aunt's clasp, and rose and walked away. If only
she could answer, alone, for her own soul ! No
one could take that responsibility from her in any

case, and it would be so much easier if she could
but fight it out her own way.

But for Mabel Trescott, with her imperial love
of domination, it was simply impossible for her
to leave her niece free. It was said of Thomas
Jefferson that ' he loved his country, and would
have died to save it ; that is, to convert it permanently
to his way of thinking.' A better description
could not be given of Mabel Trescott at
this time. If Beth would only lie passive in her
hands, and let her present and future be determined
for her, by one who considered her ooi
judgment absolutely correct, Mabel thought she
could have died content. But, as it was, an impassable
gulf seemed to yawn wider and wider
between them, a sight which made the woman,
jealous of both affection and power, frantic in her
efforts to have it close. But her endeavours were
all in the wrong direction ; nothing but the sacrifice
of self could effect it, and this was something
of which she had never thought.

A day or two after this a long rain set in ;
the house was empty and bleak, and Mrs. Trescott
tired of her inactivity, so she decided to
go to New York immediately. It had been already
agreed upon that this should be their
future residence, the girls acquiescing in what

their aunt urged, as any city, except S , was

indifferent to them. So they left the mountains,
and Bethesda found herself, one late September
day, in the port whence steamers sailed direct
for France, and the monotonous billows were all
that divided him from her.  All ? There was a
distance far more insuperable than any space
which now separated them, and she was beginning
to know it.

Early in November they were well settled in
their new home, and friends were finding them
out, and were expresses in their attentions. But
no one of the three found the society altogether
congenial. Mrs. Trescott was very critical. Everyone
was too ' shoppy, and busied about matters

in which she could take no interest, to please her
taste. Persons who were merry and promised ' a
good time,' however, were vigorously cultivated,
so that she soon became the centre of a circle of
boisterous young people who made her laugh, but
could olive her no more substantial food : and
this was not of a equality to satisfy any woman
of thirty-five.

Margaret often found herself long-in o- for the
cultured and earnest persons who surrounded
Mrs. Stanhope ; a suggestive company which
o-ave one thoughts that remained long; after the
echo of voices had ceased. It would take years
before she and Bethesda could collect about them
those Who would be of a class at all similar to the
friends of fifteen years' standing, who gathered
to Aunt Agatha as their lamp of Wisdom. Indeed,
not being of a buoyant disposition, she
thought the possibility hopeless of achievement.


Bethesda meantime was in too listless an outward

state, and of too concentrated an excitement
within, to care much what went on about
her. Trouble often makes persons selfish, and
this Bethesda undeniably was during these
autumn months. She had, it may be, considerable
excuse, but selfishness is a fault which can
never be excused. She tried to take her part in
the duties of the house, aiding Margaret in the
housekeeping, which Mabel did not care to assume
; and to her sister at least she was always
tender. But she was careless of her physical welfare,
and was so wrapped in the clouds of smoke
that constantly ascended from the battlefield,
where she fought day and night, that she saw
little of what was going on outside.

Her increasing weakness, pallor, and disability
caused her sister great distress, and Mrs. Trescott
but little less. Finally Margaret wrote to
Aunt Agatha desperately, and with promptitude
Mrs. Stanhope telegraphed and wrote for Bethesda
to come to her, alone. She was not one tolet

a creature fade away without vigorous trial
of various methods of cure.

Bethesda went, but reluctantly. Her body
was so heavy now, and her mind so full, that
she would have preferred remaining still to any
change, however agreeable. Mrs. Stanhope had,
however, understood how to so express her lone-knees
without Margaret, and her desire to visit
with Beth, that, encouraged by Margaret, she
finally yielded ; and the middle of November,
accompanied only by Marcott, found her received
\ith the tenderest cordiality in S .

This is the recruiting station,' said Mr. Stanhope
gaily, offering her his arm to escort her to
breakfast. ' I think my wife would be perfectly
happy if she had the control of a hospital, and a
limitless purse to do what she chose for them.
You couldn't have relieved her loneliness, nor filled
her heart better than by coming here to be coaxed
into health ;  and you know what a gratification
it will be to us all when she succeeds.'

Thank you,' murmured Betliesda. She felt
almost guilty under this solicitous affection ; for,
did she wish to recover ?

The change in her since the summer affected
both Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope powerfully. He
found himself speculating upon the features, thin
with conflict, and rigorous at times with self-control,
and felt when the evening was over as
if some far-away heroine had been telling him
the incidents of her daily life and listening with
courteous attention to his remarks, while really
living only in the tragedy which made her forever
memorable.

Mrs. Stanhope devoted the first week to
close, if unobtrusive study of her patient, doing
a hundred things for her restoration meanwhile,
from massage to providing a table so
daintily nourishing that it was, as Ealeigh quoted
one day, ' As if Juno had been sick, and she her
dieter.'

Mentally she gave her no less stimulating

food. Early in lier visit she put into the girl's
hands Goethe's Elective Affinities.

See what you can make out of it,' she said.
Many persons consider it immoral, and yet
Goethe asserted that it was the only book he
ever wrote sith a deliberate moral aim.'

Bethesda was soon absorbed in it, finding; it
marvellously suited to her needs. A thousand
questions were suggested, which Aunt Agatha
helped her to elucidate by a clear reasoning unobscured
by prejudice, and which constantly led
one from the small fact to the large principle ;
from the particular instance to the universal
truth.

The lesson Bethesda learned was very definite
and clear. It was, perhaps, what each one has
to learn by experience sometime during life :
that only in obedience to law is true freedom.
Within certain limits we are free ; overstep
those limits and we are inexorably bound on
every side. If we choose what is right and

good we have all truth to expand in ; if we prefer
evil we have to take it with being constantly
closer and closer bound. Order is the foundation
of the universe ; try to destroy that order and
we injure ourselves without in the least altering
circumstances. Law is unchangeable and absolute
; we but dash ourselves to death in trying
to shape it to the form of our desires.

Thus awakened the sense of the ' majesty of
virtue ' in Bethesda Hamilton's mind.

Purgatory.

Love and immortality are twin thoughts of life.

It was on the evening that she had finished this
book, and was still under its arousing; influence,
that a Mr. Blythe called. He had been a friend
of Margaret's, and still frequented Mrs. Stanhope's
parlours, round which the scent of the
rose seemed to linger. He was shy of Bethesda,
however, and she found her best method of enjoying
the thoughts he brought was in keeping
herself as unobtrusive as possible while he and
Mrs. Stanhope talked together on subjects which
she was oiad to hear discussed. In fact Mrs.

Stanhope probably led the conversation to these
subjects, for she believed in climatic influences
on thought as on nature.

There were some elections taking place, in
which, as usual, Mrs. Stanhope was interested.

 Coke upholds that a statesman should practise
expediency, I believe she said, in answer to
some rather sceptical remark of Mr. Blythe's. * God,
indeed, acts so towards us, but he always gives us
real truth as far as we are able to accept it.'

Well, I don't know,' replied Mr. Blythe ; ' it
seems to me I could endure a good deal more
than I receive.'

I think it often seems so to us all. Beth
was telling me to-day that Dante, in his Purgatory,
makes the power to ascend to heaven simultaneous
with the will to do so ; but this powerful
desire, which is at one with our whole will, only
comes after long striving. So the greater your
desire is to receive a revelation, the more must
you patiently labour for it.'

But low can I labour for a tliinQ: I don't
believe exists ? That is where I am in regard to
religious truth. I must grasp it, and hold it,
and feel it there, before I begin to labour to o-ain
it as my own. I cannot accept a thing on faith ;
it must be demonstrated to me, and it seems tome
if it cannot be demonstrated its inability is a
proof against it .'

So it would be. But you are looking for a
physical proof of a spiritual fact. How can you
prove to my senses that you think ? '

By speech.'

Then anything you don't speak I can assert
you do not think ? But let that pass. You
cannot see with your eyes, nor feel with your
hand, your intellect, and yet you would acknowledge
it was as much, if not more, you as your
cranium. You cannot prove that you love, but
cannot you believe in an manifested affection V
Mr. Blythe moved uneasily, for such had been
his feeling for Margaret. ' You cannot prove

VOL. III. E

your own individuality, and yet it is just that
which is you, is your true self. Your body is
merely a manifestation of you, as heat is of fire,
as the spark is of electricity. We must not
cramp ourselves into sense proof alone ; we must
progress beyond that, and in each advancing
stage we will find we have wider limits and
more soul room.'

That sounds true,' said Mr. Blythe slowly,
while Bethesda glanced from one to the other in
eager interest.

Just then there were ushered in another caller,
a young clergyman, who was peculiarly alive to
the needs of the time, and ready to flow with
the current of new ideas, so that he might find
their truth and controvert their error. Mrs.
Stanhope immediately introduced him to the
subject they had been discussing, and he entered
into it with readiness.

'You should read Hegel,' he said to Mr.
Blythe, smiling. ' I call him the fifth gospel.

For any one who understands him he is simply
salvation. If you once understand the meaning
of history, the use of epochs, the reason of law,
you see God in everything. It is all in the
Bible ; only few read it there. Such men as
Hegel are expounders, almost new revelations.'

Do you suppose we ever will be given a new
revelation ? ' asked Bethesda suddenly.

I certainly do,' said Mrs. Stanhope emphatically.


Ah ! do you, indeed 'i ' remarked Mr. Con-enough,
surprised. ' I would not have expected
that of you, Mrs. Stanhope.'

I am sure I see no reason against it. I
should be sorry to think that humanity had all
the truth it ever would or could receive.'

You are right ! ' exclaimed Mr. Blythe, his
face irradiating ; ' you are really sensible ! '

'Excuse me, but I don't see that,' returned
Mr. Connough. ' Christ manifested to us the
perfection of humanity, and the realisation of





divinity. He showed us God as a person, and
there can be nothing higher than the manifestation
of the Absolute. If a person asks for something
higher than this it is as if he innocently
inquired, " What is there beside the whole ? " '

Yet said Mrs. Stanhope,  each nation has
believed that its religion was the " whole," and in
spite of this it has been transcended. Why may
not the future transcend Christ ? '

Your question refers to the condition of religions
before Christ came. They were constantly
transcending one another because they had not
yet reached the reconciliation. Christ was the
first infinite, and the first is the last. Each
religion before that grew beyond and beyond ;
since Christ it is growing into itself. Christ
taught us how the finite can grow into the infinite
; how the individual can become universal.
What can there be beyond ? '

But,' said Mr. Blythe, '' there was Buddha ;
wherein did he differ from Christ ? Where was

he SO inferior ? He taught his people self-sacrifice
and morality, and that is what Christ
taught after Buddha.'

 Christ never taught self-sacrifice as an end,
only a means. He taught us to sacrifice our
lower selves to our ho-her selves : our higher
selves to our highest self. For every death he
taught a resurrection. Buddha taught : Do good
that ye may cease to exist. Christ taught : Do
good that ye may have everlasting life. The
estimation of Buddhism is self-extinction ; the
estimation of Christianity is self-realisation, as
Christ showed us. In him we have the infinite
grown out of the finite; the absolute " seing " out
of the limited '' becoming." In him we see what
humanity can be, what it is potentially, as, therefore,
what it must be in its final development.'

And you find this all in Hegel ? ' asked Mr.
Stanhope.

It is all there and in the Bible. Every man
who teaches the truth is a disciple of Christ's.

He must be ; he cannot help himself if he would.
History shows us that great ages blossom forth
into great men. One man sums up the meaning
of his time, and catches the light of the future on
his uplifted face. The world is like a great
century plant: it grows slowly from joint to joint,
and then holds up a glorious flower to the admiration
of mankind. Presently that withers,
but the century plant progresses, and its second
blossom is higher than the first. Hegel tells you
how the natural is the first blossom. Experience
alone satisfies us. Then comes the artistic.
Greece and the Renaissance make the cycle of
art, which is higher than nature ; it is nearer the
reality in its symbolism. But we have passed
beyond that to the moral cycle, which began with
the Reformation, and which is going through the
strict analysis of science in the present. It is the
fashion of our time to see infidelity everywhere,
for it to be everywhere ; but do you think for this
that the world is really growing worse ? Do you

suppose God thinks it is suddenly rolling backwards
? Xo, indeed ! Where we see decay, God
sees growth. Growth it is, though the apple
may fall with a shock that causes an earthquake,
though its decay may poison thousands. The
seed will sprout, will push itself steadily up
through the dark ground for a while, but at last
it will raise itself in the lio'ht of heaven, and we
will see its beaut v and call it o-ood.'

Then you think,' said Mr. Stanhope, ' that
all this atheism and confusion of morals will
result in something better than what went before
it ? For my part I think the good old times of
our fathers were best.'

It is because you have not looked into the
question sufficiently deeply,' said ]mr. Connough
with earnestness. ' By this minute analysis,
this destruction of all life, because only a dead
body can be dissected, the dross of human additions
and complications of Christ's life will be
cleared away. Then, when nothing remains in

our hands or minds but the dead fragments of
material which formed the home of a soul, we
shall recognise that there is something beyond
the reach of the scalpel, and we shall take truer
means to find out what it is which influences
the molecules of the brain, and causes consciousness,
or what we call soul. The powerful tendency
of the present, Mr. Stanhope, is only a
counteraction to the powerful tendency of the
past. What was then resistless in its effort to
suffocate reason by floods of blind faith, is now
washing faith away in the undertow of a receding
tide that leaves thirsty science staring blankly at
the sky. Presently we shall find that " moving
equilibrium" which Herbert Spencer calls synonymous
with perfection.'

As I understand you, then,' said Mrs. Stanhope,
'you would term this scientific investigation
of spiritual truth a kind of mental Crusade, and
one which will meet with the same result: thousands
of lost lives to buy an empty tomb.'

Precisely ! The Crusaders only repeated
what the disciples did when they went to the
sepulchre, and Christ rebuked them with the
words : " Why seek ye the living among the
dead ? " It is what the scientists are doing to-day.'

Art saved the Crusaders, I believe,' returned
Mrs. Stanhope ; ' that is, they began to seek, not
the tomb, but some more spiritual symbol of
divinity. Now, what is it that will save us ? '

Not art in any case. We are not satisfied
with that limited view. Our ideals of Christ
transcend all conceptions ever worked into canvas
or marble. Holman Hunt and Dore may try
their realistic pictures ; they will not answer our
needs. Even in art we need something more
complex. Modern life is complex ; a lyre of
three strings will not serve us. I myself think
the novel is the art of the future. It does not
circumscribe, it is suo-restive of outlines rather
than outlining. It is soul-painting, spirit sculpture.
No ; philosophical insight is, I should say,

the answer to your question, Mrs. Stanhope. But
we must carry up with us the different phases of
our religious beliefs as we do our arts. Philosophy
is not another religion : it is a higher forma
development of Christianity. But beware of
leaving your emotional religion behind you. Let
the light of reason shine through your soul's
windows, but keep warm by the fire of affection.
You should be able to both feel God's love and
see his wisdom.'

Then you, of course, think Christianity will
be the religion of the future V

Surely I do. But why trouble about the
future ? It is to-day that we live, and to-day
that we must both live nobly and think rightly.
We must throw away no opportunities to-day
which perception, energetic thought, and reverence
for truth, can bring us, or tomorrow will
still find us indolent to accept what tomorrow
brings. Every one who is not morally dead has,
I think I may affirm, some religion. They may

deny the name and the fact, but it is Christianity
which has impregnated the air with its germs of
liberty and humanity to give "free-thinkers"
their free thought and devotion to humanity.
He who is true to principle and merciful to his
neighbour obeys Christ's two commandments. I
would have the men of to-day live nobly the
present, not the past nor future. There are
many orthodox doctrines, so called, which cannot
but seem absurd or cruel to a reasonable
man. Hell and Heaven as pictured by Dante,
who does it With a far more liberal brush
than many of the theologians of to-day, are a
poetry, not a belief They are forms only, and
picture a mythology not more essential to the
life of to-day than Homer's 01}Tnpus. All these
things are but bodies which fall away and decay,
but  and here is the secret of content  the
spirit that vivifies them is only left free thereby
to make new and more elevated and uplifting
forms, which will be, whatever they are, the

world's next creed. What is a vital necessity tous
to-day is to hold close by this spirit, and
understand that it is steadfast, and unchangeable,
and serene. It is never past, nor to be ; it exists
in the everlasting Now, and though its forms
be Protean, it is simply itself.'

'Won't following one's conscience bring one
to that ? ' asked Bethesda timidly.

The belief in conscience as the highest is like
the Jewish religion. Miss Hamilton. They are
both negative, and apply only to individuals,
not to humanity as a race. They are both
full of " shan't." Look at the difference
between the Commandments and the Beatitudes,
and you will see what I mean. Besides, they
neither of them have any serenity or centre of
absolute principle. In the Old Testament, for
instance, the Lord is represented as " angry " or
pacified." As if we could " grieve " or " offend "
God ! He would be always angry, always
grieved, always relentless, if he were ever so !

We cannot alter the Eternal; but we may anger,
and grieve, and offend, and alter our consciences,
and this is what the Jews meant. The belief in
conscience is apt to fall just as the Jewish religion
did, but both have a prophecy of the Messiah
inherent in them, and to both when the time is
ripe a Saviour comes.'

He smiled down at Bethesda very kindly ashe
rose to go, but the eyes she raised to his
showed their unsatisfied hunger painfully. The
smile faded from his face, and an anxious desire
to help made him say :

When any new perception of truth comes
you may be sure it will be to one who is preeminently
in the stream of Providence ; that is,
actively, and with his whole soul employed in
the duties of life, trying to fill each one with the
bounty of an unselfish ardour. Then we must
get outside of the narrow limits of conscience
into a recognition of something larger than ourself,
in the good of society, of the nation, and

thence the Church. It will come, but we must
discipline ourselves for the highest by practice in
the lower forms. We cannot afford to pass these
by ; if we do, we lose all.'

He bowed, and, accompanied by Mr. Blythe,
departed.

What a liberal clergyman ! ' said Bethesda.

So liberal that his congregation will soon
turn him off,' remarked Mr. Stanhope drily. ' Yet
he has good ideas too. Blythe seemed greatly
interested; eh, wife?'

Yes, he needs some such man to talk to. He
thinks a woman is peculiarly constructed for the
purpose of having faith in things no man can
believe in. Of course that is folly, but a great
many men are like him. They even go so far as
to prefer a woman should believe what they can
see no sense in; it makes them more "womanly,"
they think.'

Now, you need not give me the benefit of all
that sarcasm ! ' exclaimed Raleigh, laughing.

You know I am not one of those dreadful
men ! '

But Mrs. Stanhope only smiled absently. She
was thinking of what had been said.

When I was a girl she remarked presently,
I knew a woman who felt herself made for something
uncommon, and who prepared for it by
idle waiting, because her talents were too noble
for humble use. She tried after the unattainable,
and dived after the unfathomable, to the neglect
of all ordinary duties. Thus she lost all possibility
of attaining the heights. Her feet, unaccustomed
to the first steps of the ladder, could
not through all her life climb more than the
lower ones, and those with difficulty. The stars
she worshipped, and longed impotently for wings
to attain, passed her by, and shone in other skies.
I worshipped her ; I looked confidently for that
wondrous revelation which was to surprise the
world and blind it while her long-expectant eyes
could alone sustain the light. But I recognised

that it was long in coming, and I decided that
I must content myself with lower things '

You would be the kitchen-maid,' interrupted
Ealeigh, ' and you are my Princess Cinderella.
So put on your glass slipper, and let us go upstairs.
Beth looks tired.'

You are all teaching me so much ! ' exclaimed
Bethesda, with something of her old impulsiveness.
'I shall not soon forget to-night's
lessons.'

And then the thought came to her with a
sudden pang : How much interest would Eene
take in such an evening's conversation ? He
rocked himself in his old creeds, while she was
battling in the present; was this another side
where they did not respond to one another ?

The gladness of true heroism visits the heart of him who is
really competent to say : I court truth.'  Tindal.

Help us, Lord, to feel that, when we put one hand bravely
in that of Truth, the other is clasped in thine.'  John Snyder.

In spite of siicLl conversations as these, and the
invigorating books Mrs. Stanhope gave Bethesda
to read, intellectual perception was still weak and
impotent, like a new-born babe, compared to the
mighty tidal waves of passion which surged now
and again over the woman's heart and left her
prostrate. Some little thing would recall the past,
and she would turn sick and dizzy as one does ina
heavily-perfumed room. One day when she
came in from driving, and laid aside the cloak
Eene had particularly liked, and the gloves fragrant
with the perfume he had chosen, the vivid

VOL. III. F

memories came over her with a suffocation of
desire which was well-nigh insane. The red
damask room, the buhl furniture, the deep windows
and views therefrom, were all pictured
before her in a flash which blinded her to her
present surroundings.

Fortunately Agatha called her in a moment,
and during luncheon the poignant sensation
passed. But when she came out again and saw
her wraps, she saw as distinctly the tall lithe
form, the proud head, and deep eyes of one 

 I love ! ' she exclaimed in defiance.

She went to her own room, and paced up and
down fiercely.

What is the use of it all ? ' she cried beneath
her breath. ' Let me be ill ! I am tired of fighting
and feigning ; tired of pretending to be content
when the source of happiness is poisoned ;
tired of keeping up appearances, and trying to
make even myself feel that there is still much to
live for. I don't wish to live ! I am envious of

every person whom I hear has been accidentally
killed. Why should they be thus chosen ? It is
not just that I should pass untouched where
others meet dear death. Why won't they let the
stupor of illness deaden the pain of my brain ? I
want to die, to die ! '

She had never acknowledged this to herself
before ; she had stifled, yet unborn, all such feelings
; but now she was desperate. How much
could one suffer and live ?

That same day Agatha came in to call her
for dinner, and found her asleep, and, when
she tried, could not waken her. She bade
the servant telephone for the physician who
had formerly examined her niece's heart. He
came. Bethesda had not moved ; her breathing
was hardly perceptible, and her pulse so
faint as to be unnoticeable. She lay as still
and almost as white as death, with purple
shadows under her eyes, and her mouth inexpressibly
sad.

The physician looked down at her with more
feeling than he usually displayed.

She is worn out he said. * Let her sleep
as long as she will. She can awake only to
suffer.'

 Do you mean that she cannot escape the
disease now ? ' asked Agatha.

I mean she must be a great deal worse before
she can be better. I mean, dear Mrs. Stanhope,
I mean that all your powers of nursing will be
required to bring her through.'

Is the danger of death or lingering disease ? '

Of both. There is trouble with the brain as
well as the heart.'

Is there danger of her being insane *? You
know I always wish to know the worst.' Agatha
put her hand behind her as she spoke, and
grasped the high back of a chair.

1 think not,' was the quick response,  I
should say she had a strong mind ? '

An active one.'

And with good reasoning powers ? '

Yes

She is having a great trouble of some kind ? '

Yes.'

 Has it reached the climax yet ? '

I don't know.'

She can bear little more. Yon must guard
her in every way.'

I can't, doctor ; ' and then the brave woman
broke down. This was the worst, that, do what
she might, she could not protect the frail body
from the gnawing mind.

She recovered herself in a moment, however.

There is nothing to be done until she wakens,
you say ; and then ? '

Send for me. I will come again in the morning,
anyway.'

He came without being sent for. Bethesda
still lay in the childlike posture, with one hand
beneath her cheek. They turned her over  the
horrible dead weight !  and left her for another

twelve hours. Then she wakened, and smiled at
her anne in the firelight.

I have had such a good rest she said. * It
must be quite dinner-time.'

She rose, and tried to dress, but found herself
weak and languid. Mrs. Stanhope thought it
best to tell her, very quietly, that nature had
taken a rest in her despite, and that she had slept
a whole day. Bethesda was a trifle startled, but
the hazy calm which had settled upon her shielded
her mind from active apprehension.

It was in the midst of an unusually warm and
late Indian summer, and Mrs. StanhojDC obeyed
the physician's mandate in taking Beth out for
long, slow drives over the prairie lands that rose
and fell in wooded undulations to the dim horizon.
Balmy winds blew from the south; an
indefinable fragrance filled the air ; the sunbeams
shed only soft lights through the misty
atmosphere ; the few remaining leaves were
golden, and the dark lines of branches were delicate

and fine. Empty birds' nests suggested the
spring-time with an added melancholy, and the
birds, resting in their migrations, found, where
had been the gloom of verdure, only shadows
like mellowed light.

Someway the autumn, the ripening and falling
time, came upon Bethesda with a peculiar
force of sweetness. She seemed to feel as she
would when she was middle-aged and calm, and
life had become more meditative than active 
and anguished  to her. She surrendered herself
to it voluntarily. She was content to forget just
now; she and nature together were quietly
resting.

But all too soon they woke one morning to
find their Indian summer gone, and in its stead
winter was drearily throned for an unbroken
reign. A wild prairie wind shrieked and sobbed
and moaned around the house, and large fires
barely sufficed to warm the rooms where a few
days before the endows had been open to let

the soft air enter and stir Bethesda's white dress
and fine bronze hair.

She shivered now and collected herself, and
tried to look the future bravely in the face. It
was little over a month before her final decision
must be rendered, and the correspondence with
Eene planted, to bring forth what fruits it might,
or annihilated for a practical eternity.

She investigated the abysses of her own mind
as steadily as she could. Perhaps she had been
unduly influenced by physical weakness, she
thought. Perhaps she was unwilling to follow
one course, whether conscience commanded it or
not, so unconsciously closed that issue. This
must not be. On what did Eene's greatest welfare
depend ? This was the important question.
If she broke the correspondence definitely it
might, instead of awakening his moral nature,
destroy his belief in woman, and the bitterness
would poison his whole character. If she wrote
to him, her letters would be the result of long

and severe tliouo'ht, and she miplit lead him from
doing: what lie said, to do what his conscience
said. It would be a great shock to him in any
case to find that she had changed her opinions
so much ; but the blow might benefit him, although
he had such a buoyant disposition that he
quickly adjusted himself to any burden given him
to bear, and found it light. Too light ; it did
not crush him enough to bring out the pure ore.
Eene was, however, very close to her all that
evening. Indeed, was he not always near her ?
She was not conscious of a moment when, either
active or dormant, the thought of him was other
than present. As she wakened it never came
sith suddenness that she remembered him ; the
thought wakened with her, and was quietly in
possession when she became fully conscious. She
talked and read aloud, and listened to others,
and his spirit was ever there, watchful, cherishing,
seldom importunate  for he would not have
been  but always ready to step forward into the

light of her active recognition when the imperativeness
of other demands was answered. It was
sweet and upholding ; it was as if he were consciously
present, as at the Conovers' the evening
before their departure, talking himself and leaving
her free, but drawing around her a warm garment
of unceasing attention and proud tenderness.

Several callers did not interfere with an unusually
keen apprehension of Eene's presence
until Mr. Connough commanded Bethesda's
undivided attention by what he was saying to
another caller  a Mr. Fluting.

Daniel Deronda was the topic of conversation,
and Mr. Fluting had been drawing a comparison
between Grandcourt and Deronda, and
awarding his praise to the large sympathy of the
latter. This immediately aroused Bethesda. She
was not one of those who found Deronda unreal.
Many of the touches a master-hand had given to
his character touched home to her heart. Was
not his writing with Mordecai like hers with

Eene ? Was not his wide s}Tiipatliy the element
she had tried to make her own ? Had not she
also been 'early impassioned by ideas and at
least tried ' to burn her fires on those heights  ?

The tendencies of the times remarked Mr.
Connougrh decisively, ' are to make such men as
Deronda the ideal tje. His sympathies were so
spread out into the vague that he had no convictions
; he put himself in every one's place except
his own. This is the end to which some of our
best minds aspire. Is it good ? Is it beneficial
to humanity ? For myself I doubt it. I think
we should have a generosity large enough to
embrace ourselves.'

'Some writer suggested Mrs. Stanhope,
strongly advocates this lack of convictions.
Convictions are crystallisations' he says. " It
is freezing the water of life'"

'Well, what does that amount to?' asked
Mr. Connough, controversially. 'Deronda, the
modern ideal, let us say, did nothing until he

was forced by his self-abnegation into the concentrated
life-purpose of a one-idea's man. Weare
few of us in a position to "put ourselves
back into the antediluvian period to sympathise
with a megatherium"! There is some absolute
duty for each one to perform, and we cannot
expect Fate, in the guise of a Mordecai, to bring
our work to our hands as it was brought to
Deronda's. If we misdirect our energies the
world misses the work we were born for, and we
must each find it out for ourselves.'

'Gwendolen in the same way waited for
Deronda to tell her what was right, didn't she ?
She had the moral indecision that Deronda had
intellectually.'

Yes, Deronda was Gwendolen's conscience.
She was too egotistic a nature, perhaps, to have
it awakened otherwise than by emotion, by
having a conscience outside of her ; but once
awakened, absolute separation was necessary for
her to be able to develop her real conscience.

Had she married Deronda she would never have
had anv conscience of her own at all. She
married a man self-determined at least, whatever
his faults, and Deronda married a woman also
self-determined. There was no chance about it ;
it was one of the must-be's of character. '

AVhat an insight was this for Bethesda 1 She
seized on it nth her quick intuition, and said :

Then the right thing would be to be crystallised
within oneself, and fluid to others.'

True, true!' exclaimed an incipient admirer
of Bethesda's. ' You have put it admirably, Miss
Hamilton.'

Mr. Stanhope was walking up and down the
parlour, with his hands behind him. He stopped
now, facing the group around the fire.

Did you ever hear the legend,' he said, ' of
a monk, a good but narrow-minded man, who
tried to convince every one of his own particular
creed, and failing, damned them eternally ? No
reflections, Mr. Connough 1 Well, one day he

fell asleep  a man must tire easily with such a
weight of responsibility !  and in a dream he
saw himself walking by a stream of pure water.
Presently a beautiful youth appeared, and set
many differently-shaped vessels on the bank, no
two alike, but all transparent, and then he filled
each one with water from the stream. The goodman
was perplexed when the youth looked at
him to see if he understood, and desired him to
explain ; so the angel said : " The water takes the
form of the vessel which contains it, but it is
always the same in itself. Eemember this."
And the old monk awoke, and he did remember
it, and it changed him from a dogmatic sectarian
to the widest-minded man of his times. 

And I believe with Beth,' added Mrs. Stanhope,
' that it is the same with what we are to
ourselves and to others. We can have our convictions
pure and true, and our sympathies fluid
enough to follow each curve and line of other
minds.'

There is a very good sermon in that story,'
said Mr. Connaught thoughtfully. ' I wish I
could prevail upon my people to understand that
reason is the very life of religion ; that we must
serve God with our minds as well as our hearts.'

'How do you explain ' reasonably" asked
Mr. Stanhope, ' the necessity of this blind faith
and cruel narrowness which has marked the
Christian Church '? '

I take it in this way,' was the reply. ' The
emphasis placed on faith in the earlier centuries
of Christianity was needed to consolidate the
religion and make its truths, its injunctions,
sink into the hearts of men. This speedily degenerated
into superstition, and ignorance brought
its inevitable result in sin. Then to the synthetic
unity which faith had produced was brought the
analytic power of doubt ; first in the Reformation,
now in science, and I believe one will be of
as inestimable value to humanity as the other.
By scepticism our religion Twill be regenerated ;

not in itself, for, as Christ taught it, it is eternally
of the same perfection, but in the acceptation
of it by men, which is what the world needs.
As I said the other evening, by scepticism all
the non-essentials will be eliminated, and, like
the sky when the clouds are swept away, it will
be seen as one unstained sapphire of truth from
the zenith to the horizon.'

Have you read any of Matlock's books, Miss
Hamilton?' asked Mr. Fluting, turning away
from the others with some impatience. He
much preferred a tete-tete, where he could do all
the talking, especially to such a listener. But she
was not in an indolent frame of mind to-night.
She was now, on the contrary, eager for food,
eager for knowledge, aroused once more to the
interminable combat. So she turned to Mr.
Connough with Mr. Fluting's question.

I don't know what to make of Matlock, do
you ? '

He doesn't see far. He cannot answer the

questions lie propounds, but he voices the yearnings
of the time, and reaches more truth unconsciously
than he does consciously. He makes
love, conjugal love, the waiting ground or the
antechamber of the divine. He tells men to
seek the highest they do know, while waiting
or seeking for the unknown. I think you will
find everywhere that when men do not know
God they do not comprehend the significance of
marriage. And when they realise that entire
self surrender, and a finding of themselves in
another is their greatest happiness, then they
begin to understand what it is to give themselves
to a diviner power, to an inexhaustible
love, and so come to an apprehension of God.'

There was a little silence after this. Even
Mr. Fluting did not find anything immediately
to say; but presently Mrs. Stanhope led the
conversation back into more ordinary channels,
and Mr. Connough soon rose to go. Mr. Fluting
followed him, for Bethesda was immersed in the

VOL. III. G

thoughts that had been awakened, and he found
himself a little de trop.

Bethesda's earnest effort to see was not without
success. In the night a startling possibility
suggested itself, and dazed her at first. What
if she should write to Madame d'Isten, tell the
situation frankly, and hold herself at Eene's
wife's commands ?

It might open Louise's eyes, excite her
jealousy, and thus make her realise her husband's
worth, and incite her to strive to keep
his affection. If this could be accomplished his
best welfare would be secured. The passionate
attachment between him and Bethesda should
be used as a tool for the more perfect modelling
of character.

But, would this be the result ? Bethesda
forced herself to look searchingly into the character
over whose weaknesses she had hitherto
drawn a sheltering veil. Louise d'Isten, so far
as Bethesda knew her, was undeniably a weak

woman. She was selfish, and discontented, and
passionate, with no effort to be otherwise. She
had the faults of a narrow education, and a
pernicious society. If Bethesda wrote, it might
rouse her jealousy in such a way that she would
hate her husband, and take revenge by giving
free reins to all her desires. But the thought
haunted Bethesda, and when next day a letter
from Eene, forwarded by ]airs. Trescott, came,
telling of his having been to see his wife, and
having informed her of his literary compact with
Bethesda, she thought this smoothed the path
before her.

She was ready to humiliate herself in anyway,
if by so doing she could help Eene and
Louise. Madame d'lsten was now definitely
aware that such a woman as Bethesda Hamilton
existed, and, not improbably, had some feeling
of jealousy for her already. If so, would not
the effect of the proposed letter be more towards
action than complaint ? Bethesda was sure

that, although Eene had told his wife of the
compact, he had giveth her no voice in the
matter. She, Bethesda, would do this, and,
moreover, would show Louise how she might
win her husband more fully than ever, and in
doing so, help him and assure both their happiness.
What if she should even prevail upon
Madame d'Isten to write to her, and then reconcile
the conflicting elements ? Ah, that
would be worth living for ! That would be
work meet for repentance.

But presently common sense began to reassert
itself against this high romance, and
humility taught her that these were fallacious
self-deceptions. It was not her place to anticipate
any such results from what had been
sinful error from the beginning. She must
seek a fuller and surer expiation.

While her mind was under the full effect of
this disappointment she stood one afternoon in
her bay-window, her spirit as sodden as the chill

earth. She looked dully at the leaden sky,
which seemed all of one hue, except where the
rain-laden clouds were scourged onwards by the
north wind. Involuntarily she contrasted this
December with the June six months before.
The wide streets, the avenues of blossoming
trees, the statuary, the sweet air and sunny
skies of la helle France,  how she yearned for
them I The months contrasted sadly enough in
other ways. Then the most fatiguing and
constant exertions, the late hours and light
sleep, could not detract from the gladness of
heart which made her strong and buoyant.
Now rest, intellectual food, petting without
limit, and the greatest care, could not prevent
the heavy weight within from wearing her thin,
and pale, and weak. It was the contrast of the
"flowering and decaying time.

In the midst of her dreary reflections a knock
came at the door, and a cablegram from Evra
was handed her  a tender message hoping she

was better. It might have been the thoughts
which had previously occupied her mind; it
may have been the leap of her fluttering heart,
but from the instant her eyes glanced down the
lines she felt sure Eene's tenderness had planned
it. And to Bethesda, struggling in the toils of
conflicting principles, and almost ready for the
renunciation of all happiness, it was like a voice,
a touch from Paradise. Her load was inexpressibly
lightened, and during the evening she
looked lovely beyond compare.

Not long after this came her birthday, and
both to celebrate it, and because of Bethesda's
increasing fragility, Agatha asked Margaret to
visit her for a fortnight.

The joy of the meeting between the sisters
was tempered with great sadness, for Bethesda
had failed steadily. When letters had come from
Mabel, burdened with anxiety for both soul and
body, and advocating, in season and out of season,
heT ideas of Beth's duty, they had made the weary

woman perceptibly weaker. She felt an imperative
need for freedom, and Mrs. Trescott constantly
wished to guide and direct her, and she
began to see the impossibility of drawing near to
one, however affectionate, who wishes to throw
chains about one.

But it had come to the pass now that nothing
was of any vital consequence to her but integrity
and the rio-ht. On these all her failing; strength
was concentrated. Let her questions be decided,
and then the deluge.

On her birthday, when Bethesda was not able
to leave the couch  a sad enough coming of age
for the beautiful heiress  after she had transacted
considerable business and made her will,
Bethesda asked to be left alone with Marcott. He
came and stood before her reverentially.

Marcott,' said Bethesda, ' I know you are
devoted to your master.'

Marcott started. M. d'Isten had given him
such strict injunctions never to breathe a word

of his former service, that he supposed no one
knew it.

I believe yon are also devoted to me Bethesda
pursued calmly. ' I prove my trust in you
by confiding to you this letter to be given to
your master when I die. Don't fail to give it
into his own hands, and let no one know you
possess it, except M. d'Isten. I trust this to
your honour, Marcott.'

I will give it only into my master's. Monsieur
le Comte d'Isten's hand,' said Marcott solemnly.
'I swear it by '

Hush ! Your word is sufficient. Only to
him, or to me, if I should ask it of you ; you
understand ? '

ado.'
 ' I wish you to know also that I have left you
a small sum to support you when you are old, or
ill, and to be a reminder of my thanks for your
faithful service.'

'I can never thank you, dearest lady,' exclaimed

the man, the tears streaming clown his
face, which he turned away to hide.

Don't weep for me,' said Bethesda, with
utmost gentleness. ' I shall be happier if I
die. Tell your master so.'

Her voice, too, broke, and she held out her
hand for him to kiss.

'You are only fit for heaven,' said poor
Marcott, and he left her TVT.th the precious letter
tightly buttoned beneath his vest.

Eene's letter for her, the first after the six
months' silence, came the next day, a week in advance
of its time. She laid it aside unopened. It
might settle her actions when she came to read it.
It did not seem right to her to forsake him utterly,
yet Eene's highest perception of womanhood was
embodied in her, and if right claimed that she
should be silent as well as invisible to him she
must accede. Intuition told her dimly, before
she had gone far enough to perceive it by reason,
that she could not help) him ; that this last joy

was consolation, as many others, was denied
them by their wrongdoing. They must, she
feared, expiate separately. If she only had the
real hope that he would expiate ! but she was
afraid his conscience might not awaken without
her. Thus she was, in spite of their actual present
divergence, still carrying out the principles
Mrs. Trescott had instilled into her by education
and practice; for she was endeavouring to occupy
the same position towards Eene that Mabel strove
to occupy towards her, and of which she felt so
keenly the bondage. The difference was that
Eene gloried in his obedience, and served willingly
the conscience of another, while Bethesda
found it an unendurable burden.

The night between Christmas Eve and Christmas
Day was a memorable one to Bethesda.
Margaret had placed on easels at the foot of the
bed two engravings ; one, a Holy Family by
Raphael; the other, of the Milan Cathedral.
Bethesda lay looking at them most of the night.

There was a strange sense of calm in and around
her. She felt as if she were waiting for a voice
to speak, and it recalled the fancy she had had,
when, standing on San Miniato in the spring sunshine,
she had listened to the echoes of the church
bells, losing themselves in the purple Apennines.
Then it was high noon ; now it was a winter midnight,
but the feeling; was the same.

As she lay in this clear-eyed calm, thinking
how marvellously the little beginning of the Holy
Family had developed into an infinite life, which,
to those who believed, filled heaven, and made
arts, ethics, and religion blossom into fullest
luxuriance on earth, she seemed, without any
transition, to have it clear in her mind that she
was to abrogate all spiritual control over Eene ;
that, as long as their present life separated them,
they were to be separated absolutely, with no
thought of further communication beyond the
letter she would write to tell him this.

She had had this lesson still to learn : that she

was presumptuous in thinking through her could
come his only aid ; that if she did not actively
help him he was lost. She knew that no one
can be lost or saved except by himself; he must
inevitably sink or rise with the meaning of his
own actions.

Who was she, to take the responsibility of his
deeds 1 to answer for him in heaven or hell ?
Had he no voice ? She could but trust in his
nobility, his strength, his purity. If these failed
him, in so far as these failed him, they would be
eternally separated. The infinite would come
between them.

It was not so hard as she had fancied to make
this ultimate sacrifice. Never before had she
realised how, with the strong desire to do right
comes the strength to act. A few days before
it had seemed to her that life was unendurable
without active use to him ; yet now she felt up-borne.
The majesty of virtue ! It commands
our obedience, and when we are willing to kneel

as soon as the command comes, the great king
unveils himself.

During the following week Mabel, alarmed by
the accounts received from Agatha and Margaret,

came on to S . In the first interview they

had alone, Bethesda told her aunt of her decision.
Her words were few, and impregnated with a
gentle weariness, undisturbed by tears, praises,
and tears again, which were showered upon her.
She seemed very far away from it all, and as if
she were looking on something; in which she had
no part.

She lay on the bed all day lifted on numerous
pillows, her face tired to faintness. Margaret
hovered around her with unobtrusive attentions,
and Bethesda liked to have her near. Hers was
the only presence which did not weigh upon the
sensitive woman.

If you will just let me rest,' she said once,
when the physician came.  I don't want anything
but rest and Margaret.' And Margaret

banished the others with more energy than that
of which ordinary events would have shown her
capable, and constituted herself a sister of the
tenderest charity. She thought Beth would die,
and when she remembered the past months of
suffering, felt almost reconciled to losing her.
She would soon join her where God would wipe
away all tears from their eyes.

Bethesda lay thus all the holiday week, asking
little, doing nothing except to bear the pain
which steadily increased. Many flowers were
sent her, and a fresh basket of the loveliest roses
was constantly on the silken quilt beside her, a
delicate attention from Mr. Stanhope. She lay
amid the flowers like a snow-drift in spring,
stealthily decreasing in strength, and likening
more and more to its whiteness. She was quite
passive in mind and body until New Year's Day,
when she roused herself, conscious that now
there was something for her to do. She
gathered all her strength for the consummation

of lier sacrifice. This clone, and she had nothing
more to think about. Nothing more. The
future from this day was a dead blank to her.
To-day was all she had to live. To-morrow
was beyond her thoughts.

She early asked Margaret to bring her the
olive-wood box which contained Eene's letters,
and those she had already mostly written, to be
sent to-dav. Then she had asked her sister to
leave her, and kissed her on both cheeks, as if to
fortify herself by these sweet touches.

When she was alone she slowly broke the
seal of Eene's long - anticipated letter. She
trusted it would be strong and helpful, and
yet she wished to be prepared for any event.
As she read it her face gathered sadness which
made her seem a woman arrived at the maturity
of sorrow, and as she finished it her hand was
pressed close against her heart.

The letter showed him blind, so blind !
These months had apparently brought him

nothing of growth or clear-sight. He had not
once questioned himself deeply in regard to
their relationship. He did not recognise that
there was anything to question. He had incorporated
his position towards her into an unquestionable
part of his existence. He saw no
use in examining with a view to change what
was unchangeable. And the woman's heart felt,
if her mind did not yet recognise, that where
there is no growth, love must die. It was
the bitterness of this cup which she was now
drinking.

He had enclosed a red leaf, the last on the
Virgin Vine which wreathed itself around her
window, now his. It recalled with absolute
distinctness the many hours she had spent
kneeling there. She could see still the solemn
march of the stars across the violet sky, and feel
again the deep content which had been one of
her own strongest proofs that her position was
not wrong. So divine is love, so high does it

spring above all earthly stains to its quencMess
source !

He was now in the same position, under the
same influences, that she was then. She must
remember this, and not be unjust, but give him
time.

With the leaf, holding the heart's blood of
the year, she closed her journal for ever. It
was a fitting seal for the past.

She then read over and sealed her letter to
Madame d'Isten. As she closed it Margaret's
voice was heard at the door.

May I come in? I have something for you.'

It was a cablegram from Eene : birthday
greetings, and hoping she was well.

The very sweetness of this attention, this

thoughtfulness which was so sure a proof of

affection, made the task before her still bitterer.

But it must be done. She smiled faintly as she

put the open telegram in her sister's hand, and

said :

VOL. III. H

A little longer, dear ; my work is not quite
done and Margaret reluctantly left her.

The letter to Eene was now to be finished ;
the last  the very last. She told him of her
change in opinions, and how it had come about ;
how she had struggled long, through conflicts
the deathless of which she let him guess that
he might be aided to an equal devotion to principle;
and how at last she had become convinced
that their correspondence would be a sin.
The renunciation of it had not been without its
consolation, she told him ; for if our greatest
desire is to live rightly, truth becomes sweeter
and dearer to us than any error possibly can be.

Then she spoke to him of his wife ; of how
her aunt had told her that Madame d'Isten was
in a precarious position, tempted to do wrong on
every side, and that he had granted all her
desires, however repugnant to himself. She
recalled how they had once named him an
'ideal husband,' but said, that since she had

thought more, she realised he failed with his
wife, as they had with one another, in not holding
principle highest of all. Where persons
were to be sacrificed, he was generous in sacrificing
himself; but principles should never be
sacrificed to any person. No happiness is so
necessary as nobility. Indulgence is not always
laudable. Instead of permitting any intercourse,
even of the slightest, between his wife and her
former lover, he should endeavour to prevent it
with all his force. ' Hurt her, no matter how
deeply,' wrote Bethesda ; ' cut away her dearest
wishes, but do not let her remain in the atmosphere
of sin.' He should be severe with himself
as with her; severe with her as with
himself. Generosity may be weak ; mercy also ;
clear-sighted justice should be the foundation of
our actions. To his wife he could give aid ; her
he could serve by active use, but he and Bethesda
must bear the consequences of their past in complete
separation. Their lives would bring their

BETHESDA. [PART II.

consequences in the future as well as the present.
Like mingles with like throughout life and immortality,
and so their lives would join or divide
as they were similar or dissimilar.

To this letter Bethesda now added a few
grateful lines for his good wishes, and ended
with the words,  I trust you.'

She said them over and over to herself as she
sealed the letter, and in it her hopes, her life
itself. She had fought hard ; she had thus far
conquered. She had made her supreme renunciation
to the cold but complaint - hushing
majesty of virtue. That it was right was
sufficient ; but she could not help feeling what
a consolation it would be to know the tenderness
of religion, and to do right because God
willed.

What remained now but death ?

Margaret ! ' came the heart's quick cry,
and her sister was in the room the same
instant.

Alien Marcott brought word that the letters
were registered and mailed Bethesda let herself
sink back on the pillows, and, as Margaret bent
to kiss her :

Good-night, dear,' she said, and fell asleep.

Love is a distinction of two, who yet, for each, other, are
simply not distinguished. . I have my self-consciousness in
another, not in myself ; yet it is another in which alone I am
satisfied and at peace with, myself. . . . This perceiving, this
feeling, this cognisant of unity is love.'  Hegel.

 There are in the world but two loves  the love of self
extending to the contempt of God, and the love of God extending
to the contempt of self.'  St. Augustine.

Bethesda's letter reached Eene one day in
January as lie was about to go to the minister.
He turned back to his room, the one she had occupied,
where a cheery fire was burning, and every
article of furniture, every breath of air, seemed
to welcome him in the name of his beloved.
How good she was to be thus always beside him.
How many men would wish to be in his place,
feeling themselves watched over by the tenderness
of so incomparable a woman !

He seated himself in the wine-red fauteuil,
where her dainty form had often been luxuriously
supported, and took from the locked drawer of
the desk her picture, which he turned towards
him and regarded with joyous expectation.

Thou hast Tvitten,' he cried. ' Once more
naught is between us. Thou art my Bethesda ! '

He touched the letter to forehead, lips, and
breast before opening it with Oriental homage, as
if to pledge his whole being to her anew, and
then he broke the seal.

Three hours later he still sat staring at the
pages in his hands.

Yet the dethronement of all his ideal hopes
had not come upon him vdth the suddenness
Bethesda had anticipated. During the months
of silence between them he had, with his usual
foresight, attempted to face every possibility,,
and adapt his possible codes of action to . the
various manners in which Bethesda might write.
In hearing of her failing health, and seeing ]airs.

Trescott's increased rancour towards him, he
understood the battle Bethesda was fighting, and
had tried to follow her by guesses, some approximating
the truth, some as distant as the poles
from the reality. By dint of these imaginings
he had fancied he was prepared to face anything,
from a burst of warm sunshine to a temporary
eclipse ; but the complete sacrifice she asked was
a renunciation surpassing any he had dreamed of
making.

Once recognising her unblessed will, however,
it became his sole possible course. He never
thought of combating her decision ; he accepted
it as supreme and inviolable. His submission
was not easy ; on the contrary, it was inexpressibly
hard. He read over and over again her
words with dry, burning eyes ; with an agony of
sorrow that bliss was denied them both ; with a
bitter outcry against fate; but always with
entire obedience to her.

Had any one praised or blamed him then, he

would have looked at the speaker in bewilderment
and said simply :

How can I do differently *? Do I not love
her ? '

Such obedience to what is accepted as the
highest, such devotion to what one beloved asks,
is perhaps the most perfect of all foundations for
nobility of character. In this Eene d'Isten's
nature was of the finest feminine fibre,  as
prayer is feminine, as the Church is said to bethe
bride of Christ,  but it was also feminine in
that it obeyed and followed where Bethesda
reasoned and led. This was not altogether
wrong. The two had in some ways interchanged
their attributes, as all men and women must at
certain periods. It is a woman's place to be a
lawgiver in family relations, as it is a man's in
politics and science. It is a woman's place to
lead in spiritual things, in fine perceptions of
truth, in the chiselling of life, as it is a man's to
lead in hewing out the strong blocks of institutions

which build up the world. Woman must
be in many instances conservative and discriminating,
where man can be audacious and
radical ; but it is only as all these feminine and
masculine qualities modify one another by interruption
that the perfect human being ensues.

Now Eene was far from perfect. His obedience
was not to Grot nor right, but to the creature
he loved best. He had himself said of the ardent
phrases which Thomas a Kempis addresses to the
lover of his soul,  I could sooner say that to my
friends than to God.' And now his words were
verified. Had it been possible for him to imagine
Bethesda commanding him to do something
wrong, as now she did the right, he knew he
would have obeyed, trusting her beyond himself.
And he did at present. He could not see the
wickedness of exchanging letters with the purest
woman he had ever known, but since she said so
he would think it so.

The suppressed anguish within him at last,

however, drove him to restless pacing of the room.
A thirst for a sight of her, for a glance into her
eyes, for a touch from her hand, was so extreme
that his brain reeled. To make this renunciation
visibly with her, to have palpable contact at least
long enough to separate,  these were his maddening
thoughts.

o o

He tore open his cravat and leaned far out of
the window, where the leafless vines were rubbing
dully against the wall. The bleak wind around
his head was balmy in comparison to the icy
doom upon him. He drew back with a groan,
and took her picture in both hands and looked
into the steady eyes with a wild intensity.

Never to see thee ag-ain ? ' he muttered.
Never to hear thy voice ? Never to touch thy
hand ? Ah, how cruel is God ! It would be so
little to him, so much to me  to us ! For thou
lowest me, Escla ! Each word of thy earnest sentences
is pressed full of tenderness. And God to
destroy such love ! But it cannot be destroyed I

It will endure ! it shall endure ! In spite of the
world and time and death, we shall be united
somewhere ! 

He had raised his hand as if taking an oath ;
now slowly it fell to his side, and before her
picture he dropped to his knees.

Help me, Bethesda, as thou hast done. Thou
art a saint and holy; thou raises me with
thee. We cannot be disunited. We will be true
to one another for ever. So help me God and
Esda ! '

He rose with a reverential quietude in his
manner, and adjusted his dress, and took his hat
to go out ; but he turned as he reached the door,
hot tears standing in his eyes. The contrast
between the incoming and the outgoing was excruciating.
He faltered, then flung his hat aside,
and fell down before the red chair, burying his
face in it, while his form was convulsed with hard
sobs.

He looked years older when he finally stood

erect again, and this eyes were sunken and dull.
He pulled this list down over them and went out,
tills time without turning; back. A long; walk
somewhat re-established his equipoise, and with
it came a great compassion for her who had been
obliged to transfix her own heart in thus stabbing
He went rapidly to the Bourse and sent the
following; cable message : 

 Thy dll is my law.'

Invigorated by this he returned to his hotel,
and vote to Louise in the spirit that Bethesda
had commanded. He asked his wife to come
to him, saying that he had committed errors
as great as hers, but not greater, and that he
believed it was their duty to help one another,
resigning: themselves to the bond which united
them, and endeavouring; to strengthen and ennoble
each other's Eves. He spoke clearly but tenderly
of the temptations which he knew assailed her,
and asked her to think seriously before she again
refused to come to him. He told her that an

angel from heaven lead given him new light,
which he asked her to share, so that they might
strive towards the right together.

He wrote with a profound sadness, and, he
thought, as profound a resignation ; but, when the
letter was done, he turned to Bethesda's former
letters with an elan of desperation which was
thoroughly characteristic of the man.

Outwardly, in actions, in words, in appearance
even to himself, he bent to the inevitable with a
pliancy which was as far removed from weakness
as is that of a finely-tempered steel blade. But
deep within him at times there came a fierce revulsion,
a snapping back of the defiant sword,
which shocked his whole physical and psychical
system, and left him tingling with a surcharge of
electric force. This was his condition now. Had
the chivalric spirit within him been restored to
the chivalric era whence it descended, he would,
in this mood, have traversed lands and seas, and
won the woman he loved at the point of the

sword, regardless of all laws save those of force
and love.

But the woman lie loved did not belong to
that era. she was essentially modern,  that is,
endowed with the supremacy of mind over matter,
of morality over desire, of thought over action ;
and he recognised that, did he have her in his
power, did he hold her never so close, the gulf
between them would be only widened, implacable,
absolute. His sole power of bridging it was in
yielding, and drawing near to her, above the
physical, in the same spirit as that which possessed
her, thus annihilating space, and making
them to stand side by side, heart touching heart,
in spite of distance and silence.

The fierce ancestral ultraism was exorcised, and
he cleaved with new strength to his allegiance.
He again took out her last letter and pored over
it, weighing every sentence, and reading to the
subtlest feather touch of feeling between the lines.

She was crushing her heart down under the

o

weight of rigid law, before which she had laid
herself and him as before a Juggernaut, looking
with calm but unutterably sad eyes at the advance
of the deity to whom all sacrifices were due. His
darling ? His Esda ? Was her delicate, sensitive
nature thus to be mangled and he stand by
motionless ? Horrible ! But  and the thought
made him seat himself again whence he had risen
with fury  it was her will, it was her command,
and they were but one. What she did he did,
as by a law of nature.

The next day Eene was writing an answer 
his final words  to Bethesda, when several letters
were brought him from Louise. He had received
none for some time, as floods had interfered with
postal arrangements.

Before receiving Bethesda's letter he had
written to Louise with veiled suggestions, and
had quoted several things Bethesda had admired.
In one of the letters now before him Louise said
these remarks had inspired her with the wish to

be near him, protected from herself by him, and
sbe had resolved to leave the following week for
Paris. On further thought, however, she had
concluded to spare him this derangement of his
life, and the annoyance she might cause him.
This was the last time, she wrote, that she would
speak of her troubles ; not that she should cease
to be frank, but because there would soon be an
end of this for her. She begged him to think of
her with compassion on the day when her lover
was to be transferred to another province, and
yet not to be sorrow-ful, for she would soon be no
longer in danger of soiling his name and honour.

What did it mean ? The letter was the gentlest
he had ever received from her. Was she decided
on entering a convent, of which she had often
spoken 1 Or was she again thinking of suicide ?
Or did she simply wish to imply that with her
lover's departure she would be no longer tempted ?

This was the most probable, but the others
were quite possible. She was of an unseasonable

VOL. HI. I

cast of mind, and prone to follow every impulse.
What would have been Bethesda's advice were
she there now ? He quickly decided, and sent
Louise a despatch saying that an important
letter had crossed hers, and for her to do nothing
until she received it, unless it was to come to
him, which would greatly gratify him. Then he
wrote testifying his sympathy, and forgiving her
freely, saying he also had need of forgiveness,
and urging her to come to him. '

There are few men who demand of themselves
as much as they do of their wives, and who consider
that a sin is as great in a man as a woman.
It was one of the best traits of Eene d'Isten's
character that he had given himself even less
liberty than he had accorded to Louise, and that
now he was quick in acknowledging his fault as
grave as hers, although there were not as many
months in his error as there were years in hers,
and many circumstances which had seemed to
purify his connection with Bethesda were lacking

in Madame d'lsten's situation. Although Eene
d'Isten had fallen from the ideal of stainless
purity, which was now being developed in him
through Bethesda, many men would be bettered
if they did no worse. It was his consciousness
of this which had assured him of his power to be
unlike other men.' He had at least lived upto
the intellectual perception of purity which
he had gained through his life's experience,
and now he was advancing ahead of it and of
her.

When he returned to his letter to Bethesda he
told her what had occurred, and added : ' My
life shall be spent in fulfilling thy desires. God
sent me Bethesda as one of his heavenly host in
the hour of great need. Without her what
would I have been ? When the devil tempts mea
voice from the depths of my conscience calls :
'' Bethesda !" and the temptation flees. When I
wish help and advice I think : " What would
Bethesda say ? " and my mind becomes clear.

When I need strength to follow the dictates of
wisdom I invoke thee to aid me.'

It seemed more than he could do, more than
strength would allow, to send away this letter, 
this acquiescence in a lot which was torture ; this
ultimate, final word. But * Bethesda wills ! '
came up from his heart, and he accepted what
was decreed by her beloved hand.

The letter was registered and sent, and then
he succumbed to a morne despair. It lasted all
the long night ; but Rene knew too well the
vital necessity of equilibrium to let himself be
thrown from it without a struggle. There are
some natures to whom this centre of gravity is
more necessary than to others. To lose it means
to them to lose sanity, an irretrievable loss.
Others can be pushed down on either side, can
be crushed almost in their fall, and yet regain,
even retain, mental action. Such was one of the
differences between Rene and Bethesda.

In the icy dawn Rene walked swiftly down the

Champs Elysees  bitter mockery!  and on and
on interminably. As lie reached a church where
he had once been with Bethesda early Mass was
just beginning, and the organ notes seemed to
summon him to enter. He went in. There
were few present, only some working girls, thin
and worn, who, in the midst of this great sceptical
city, had risen early to have a word of comfort
before proceeding to their dreary drudgery.

M. d'Isten stopped just inside T\dth his hat in
his hand, but little reverence in his heart. At a
side altar near him a young priest was droning
through the service in an uninterested monotone.
The church was close, and chill, and dark. It
all seemed to him senseless frippery and affectation.
One touch, a single breath from the lips
of his beloved, would mean so infinitely more to
him, and this God denied him. He turned to
go. Just then there flashed the first level sunbeam
through the painted window against the
pillar where Bethesda had stood months before.

The golden light in the dark church might have
easily been mistaken for the visible glory around
the head of a saint.

Eene sank on his knees. His eyes were fixed
with wide intensity on the yellow sunshine, and,
as plainly, he saw the shining masses of hair, the
pearly brow, the deep eyes which looked at him,
which held him, which shone through him with an
unspeakable tenderness and bravery. They quelled
each rebellious thought, every element of despair,
and left him, as the vision dissolved, resigned.

He drew a long breath and rose. There were a
dozen pairs of curious eyes upon him, but he did
not notice them. They saw him drop several
Napoleons into the aumdniSre, and go out into
the now sunny street with a lightened step. He
had lifted the burden God and Esda had given
him to bear with a heartfelt peace. The two
were the same to his mind for the time. Obedience
to the one meant now, at least, submission
to the other.

Time aim of life is action, not a thought.'  Carlyle.

How strangely fair
Yon round still star ! which looks half-suffering from,
And half-rejoicing in its own strong fire.
Making itself a livelihood of light.'

On returning to his rooms Eene chasten found no
small event to try his new-found tranquillity. A
telegram from Louise awaited him, demanding
that he should come to her. She had received a
letter from America, and was ill.

The news alarmed and angered him. Had
Mrs. Trescott taken it upon herself to interfere 1
This was too much. There was no saying what
awaited him, or where it would end. Complications
were entangling themselves around him.
He was unprepared for this, and it was singularly

distasteful to him. He strenuously objected to
disturbance of regulated actions, or, if anything
was to be changed, he wished to have the master-hand
in the matter. This surprise, thus sprung
upon him where his position was weakest,
annoyed him extremely. He did not think of
it as a possibility, in these first moments, that
Bethesda was the one who had written to
Louise.

But even if she had  for he came to this at last
it was not her place to have taken such a responsibility,
and, for the first time in their whole
acquaintance, he was thoroughly out of S3riiipathy
with an action which perhaps was hers. He was
selling to leave the guiding of his life, his happiness
or misery, in Bethesda's hands ; but when
she came into the relations between him and his
wife, from the ife's side, she overlooked limits
which she ought to have seen and regarded.

How often do men argue in the same manner
\\dth their submission to God ! The parallel is

not irreverent here, for, to Rene d'lsten, Bethesda
at this time practically represented God. He
submitted to her decrees, threw his heart before
her, laid himself at her feet in profound humility,
he thought : but there were some conditions nth
which she must not interfere unless she wished
him to rebel, and here was one of these. Yet,
perhaps, could Bethesda have seen him during
these moments of anger and severe blame of her,
she might have bravely recognised that this was
what she had aimed at, for in truth she was
detaching him from herself, and attaching him
to the place where his duty lay, and thus her
end was being accomplished.

He sent a telegram to Louise saying he would
start that night, and for her to trust in him.
Then he went to the finisterre, where he found
some trouble in gaining leave of absence, and in
the evening threw himself into the express-with
the determination to resist all intrusions, and
arrange his life to suit himself. He was worn

out ; his nerves were unstrung with the tense
strain of severe and conflicting emotions; but,
as the train whirled him through the dark land,
and all voluntary motion was unnecessary, he
seemed to leave his body resting in the corner,
while his mind was free and active. In this
state, in the solitary silence of the carriage, with
the stars looking down, better thoughts came to
him.

If Mrs. Trescott had done this  why, that
was one thing, and he clearly had a right to be
indignant ; but if Bethesda, his Esda, had written
to Louise  that was quite a different affair. What
would she have written ? What would have been
her reasons for writing at all ?

He took out her letter, and re-read it. Why
she should have written was still a mystery, but,
if she had written, it probably was to try and
bring Louise to him, as here in this letter she
had tried to take him to Louise.

Would a woman who loved do that ? Could

she ? Was jealousy so far removed from even
the daintiest feminine breast as to desire and
work to the end of being replaced ? Impossible !
And yet, if any woman could do it, that woman
would be Bethesda. He could imagine her standing
between him and Louise, and joining their
hands, with a far-away tenderness in her deep
eyes.

Bah ! He was idealising her too far ! He
was making her into a bloodless angel, not a
clinging, devoted, impassioned woman, such ashe
 no one so well !  had known her.

But if it were Bethesda who had smitten,
which he more and more inclined to believe, this
should be the end towards which he would work.
He would show Louise that the alteration Bethesda
had made in him was all for the better, that
he had gained a new strength under her influence,
and was now, at her wish, ready to sacrifice a
great and innocent happiness which might fiend
Louise.

Ah, beloved !' he exclaimed, smiling softly.
Not thus canst thou detach me. So long as I
live nobly, it will be hand-in-hand with thee.'

When he reached M his anxieties were on

the alert, but outwardly he was calm ; perhaps
even a trifle more unruffled than usual. He
kissed the hand of his mother-in-law, who met
him with a sharp interrogation in her eyes ; asked
after his wife's health with solicitude, and, learning
that she was no better, and almost delirious
with desire to see him, excused himself instantly,
and went to her apartments.

Louise was in the somewhat untidy, though
luxurious boudoir, lying on a sofa in a negligee
of crimson wool, over which her hair fell in stray
locks that gave her a gipsy-like appearance. Her
handsome face was disfigured with weeping, and,
beneath that, an habitual expression of discontent.
Her mouth was unpossessed and trembling,
and, as she saw Eene, she rose impetuously and
fell upon his neck with a sudden cry of 

My husband ! my husband V

Never had he been so warmly greeted by her,
and it was with sadness that he thought what
joy such a welcome would at one time have given
him. Now it was too late.

He supported her, however, with a firm tenderness,
and gradually made her more composed
by reassuring words. He prevailed upon her to
sit down at last, and placed himself beside her.
Even as he did so a rumpled letter, half-hidden
among the pillows, and bearing the well-known
characters of Bethesda's handwriting, caught his
eyes.

It was from her, then. The thought steadied
him. The consistency of Bethesda's character
made it possible for him to repose upon her.
With Mabel the opposite would have been the
case, and the reasons equally good.

Louise, quick to see now, noticed his glance,
and instantly seized the obnoxious letter, and
thrust it into his hands.

Head it ! ' she cried, with a passionate wail in
her voice. ' Tell me if it is true. Who is this
woman who writes to me so authoritatively ?
What has she to do with me, or I with her V

She had caught his arm, and was leaning forward
to look in his face with wild eyes.

Let me read it first,' was the gentle answer.

No 1 no ! tell me first. I cannot wait longer.
Who is this " Bethesda Hamilton " ? See ! there
is the name signed. Now, who is she V

There was a fiery rebuke in her eyes, but he
met them without fear. After a moment's steady
gaze he said slowly :

Do you forget what I told you of a literary
correspondence with Miss Hamilton ? I will add
this now : She is the noblest of women, and she
is your and my best friend.'

Ah, my Eene ! my husband ! do not say
that ! ' cried Louise, throwing herself back in
despair ;  she too says it, she too ! and now you
confirm her !  Am I then nothing to you V

She tried to draw herself up haughtily at these
last words, but he laid his hand over hers and
said in a low tone :

'Thou art my T\ife, Louise; thou must remember
that. We must always be much to one another.'

'Must!' exclaimed Louise, sith bitterness.
No, it is not necessary. I can free myself 
and you.' '

Not without crime,' said Eene in a distinct
whisper.

She shrank away from him appalled.

Head the letter,' she said ; ' we 'vill talk
afterwards.'

She sat and scanned his face as he read. He
did not hasten ; he Wished to be well permeated
with the spirit of Bethesda.

She was in truth the angel he had dreamed,
only far surpassing his vision in compassionate
tenderness and pathos. It was no bloodless saint
who wrote this, but one whose blood became the
wine of life to others.

Well ? ' said Louise impatiently, as she saw
his eyes reach and linger on the end.

Did I not speak truth ? ' he answered with a
proud and reverential tone.

How V asked Louise defiantly.

Hast thou once thought, Louise, of what this
letter meant to her ? Hast thou thought what
she takes from herself to offer to thee ? She has
told you nothing but the truth, and the whole
truth. She held the destinies of my life in her
hand, and for you, on your account alone, Louise,
she has sacrificed herself and me. She has given
up all the innocent happiness we might have had
without infringing your rights, but which she
feared might offend you. Further,  listen a
moment, Louise,  further, she speaks to you as
to a sister ; she asks you to let her be a sister
to you. She has sympathy with you and a
heart full of compassion, but she knows also
what is right, and she is too humble to think
herself stronger than others, and so expects them

to do whatever right may demand. Ah, it is
hard, Louise ! She knows it, and I know it.
But to noble natures it is possible. She knows
thou hast much nobility, for I also spoke the
truth, and you see she appeals to that nobility
in you. She desires, she yearns to help you to
overcome temptation and sorrow. She sees that
it is right for you and me to be united, and she
tries to make us happier for her coming into our
lives. This is the angel who shed a new light
on my path. She has, I know well, already
made me a better and a truer husband to you,
Louise. Let her help you also. She says here,
see, that there is no happiness which would be
so great to her as to aid you in carrying your
burdens, or in relieving you from them. She
would be willing to carry the burdens of the
whole world to help others !' he exclaimed in an
irrepressible outburst. Then calming : ' Louise,
my Tvdfe, why should this letter, so brave, so
gentle, have caused a tumult in your soul, ex-vol.

III. K

kept because you know she advises you rightly ?
During the seven years that we have been
married, you will acknowledge that I have not
complained. Neither do I now. Let this letter
commence a new era in our lives, Louise. We
have both erred; we both need forgiveness. I give
you mine freely ; give me yours, and let us walk
together towards where this saint's hand points.'

Louise d'Isten was melted and silenced, she
knew not how. The something new in her husband
produced a profound impression upon her.
The modulations of his voice stirred her strangely;
its reticent sadness, its dignified contrition touched
the barren rock of self-pity into a gushing, if
momentary, fountain of sorrow for another.

She struggled with her tears a few moments
in silence. Then she turned and buried her face
on her husband's breast, and clung to him with
an entirely new yearning. He held her to him
closely, and his face was illuminated as he murmured
in his heart :

Art thou content, Saint Esda V

Rene stayed with his wife for six weeks. They
drew closer together than they had ever done
through the communion of a sorrow shared, a
double forgiveness, and an awakening of new
life in the feelings of Louise towards her husband.
She was c[uite ill for a time ; now burning
with fever, and again exhausted by its
reaction. He tended her with the closest care,
and an almost feminine delicacy ; but there was
a distance between them she could never cross.
Sometimes she would waken to find him staring
at the floor with an expression of such pain that
it tore her heart. Yet she could not appear to
be awake or his face would change instantly to
a look of cheerful service, and the mask he kept
for her, she told herself bitterly, would again
cover his face.

Remorse and retribution were mingled in
those days for her. She was beginning to
realise what she had thrown away, and with

her lover s ultimate departure, which had occurred
the day before Eene's arrival, the stronghold
of selfishness and mistaken devotion was
thrown down, and nothing was left to interfere
with the invading army of feelings, hopes, and
fears, complex and mystifying even to herself,
which had possessed her since she had seen her
husband in his new aspect, and had known the
strong forces at work in his life.

She felt an insuperable jealousy for Bethesda,
and yet an awe, as of something uncomprehended
and powerful, in view of the supreme renunciation
which that distant woman had made in her behalf.
She began to ask herself unwilling questions :
Would she have done such a thing for the wife of
Alphonse ? No ! was the instant defiant answer.
But then, that was not the same ; it could not
be the same ; and yet, she was forced to ask :
Why not ? Surely Kene, her husband (again defiantly),
was worthy of a woman's love, more so,
indeed, than most men. This Bethesda was not

the first one who had found him noble in character
and fine in intellect. And then she turned
to study him, and to see in him the many traits
which a woman, ' if she were so inclined,' would
love. Gradually she found herself becoming
detached from the past which was perforce gone
from her, and working in the present ; half unconsciously
it is true, but perhaps none the less
earnestly ; while towards the future she looked
with a wholly unknown zest,  something more
than zest  a desire, a longing to make the future
different and better, and to do somewhat for
Kene as he had been so long, she now saw, doing
for her.

From this point she grew better, and many
were the long and quiet talks she and Rene had
during the weeks which followed all too softly.
There was a calmness, a recueillement about him
at times, however, which drove her to solitary
despair. She was put and kept so far away !
She had put herself there, true ; it had used to

be her pleasure, but now, in spite of her endeavours,
still paroxysmal and egotistic, something
ever came between them ; a distance, a
transparent wall of feeling, which separated them
relentlessly.

Sometimes she would go to the mirror, after
a recognition of this blank fatality, and would
push back her hair, and gaze at the handsome
face pitifully enough.

Of course you are not comparable to that
blonde Bethesda ! ' she caught herself saying one
day. ' She is beautiful, and young, and fresh
and you ? You have cried away your beauty,
and your youth, and your freshness ; he cannot
care for you ! '

She threw a veil over the mirror, and went
away sullenly. It was no use trying. Alphonse
might forgive her for the beauty which had been
lost through grief for him, but this would hardly
be a passport to Eene's favour. That fair Bethesda,
with her earnest devotion and incomprehensible

self-sacrifice, kept constantly coming
between her and her husband. Ah, she knew
what it was ! Had not Alphonse's face haunted
her most when her husband was present ? And
and now,  she did not know what to make of
it ; it required an effort for her to be able to
recall his features. But Eene had no effort to
make to see this Americaines. No, not he !
There he was now T\T:iting, and if not to her, he
was thinking' of her. ' I miorht as well be dead,
and out of the way at once,' she murmured between
half suppressed sobs.

And then Eene would close the desk softly,
and would join her, and draw her to him  ' As
if I were his sister ! ' she would think indignantly.
But she would not move away, and soon either
the tones of his voice, or the sight of his self-contained
face, would hush her complaining, and
once more good spirits would reign.

The mother-in-law knew nothing of the explanation
which had brought Louise and her

husband closer together than ever since their
marriage. It was not a request of Eene's, but
an instinct in the heart of Louise, that kept
Bethesda and all pertaining to her a conjugal
secret. At least in this she was nearer her
husband than any one else ; and meantime he
spoke to his wife quite freely, if with tact, of
Bethesda. He wished to keep the fact of her
bringing them together continually before the
mind of Louise, and indeed of his own. He was
growing to feel a certain sense of her being out
of his reach, beyond him, which the entire silence
falling after her last noble words naturally increased.
To dispel this he would talk to Louise
of Bethesda's character, and aims, and history.
He told her of the family conditions surrounding
Bethesda ; of her position and wealth ; but his
manner was always as if he were mentioning one
very dear to him, now dead. Occasionally a
perception of this would come over him with a
shudder. It might be a presentiment.

It was in consequence of these conversations
that Madame d'Isten finally resolved to write to
Miss Hamilton. She did not know what she
should say, but she believed the act would please
her husband, and it was only polite to acknowledge
the receipt of her letter, and to tell her that she
was not offended. For it had really come to this.
She was no long-er offended T\ith Bethesda : she
felt the good this catastrophe had brought her,
and fore-felt the developments which in the future
might spring from it. Not that she was conscious
of any of this, but the possibilities hovered about
her like protecting angels, and seemed to enshrine
the thought of the far-away woman in an atmosphere
of benignity, and, yes, of gratitude.

It would have been impossible for her to express
this, but when one day she came to Eene,
and said timidly :

"Would you like me to  to T\T:ite to '

'Bethesda?' he exclaimed, springing up, and
catching her hands in glad approval.

Almost as quickly did he realise what was in
her mind, and the manner in which she regarded
his saint. So, his fairest dreams were perhaps
to be accomplished ! Bethesda and Louise
would be personal friends ! It was almost too
good to be true.

He drew Louise towards the desk to secure
the good deed while she was still in the mood ;
and she seated herself, trembling a little, not
alone with fear, but with the stabbing pain of
jealousy that came and went in her heart. He
liked her so much better now that she was going
to do something for this * Bethesda ! '

He spread paper and ink and pen before her,
and then moved away, not to disturb her, and to
indulge in the visions this act of hers created.
But it was not at all her purpose to let it separate
them ; what she wished was to be near him, to
have him take an active interest in her,  he
might at least while she was writing this letter !
So she called him back to tell her how to commence

it, and then, what should she say ?-

Didn't she know ?  Of course she didn't ! This
woman was a writer, and he must express it all
for her, dictate it to her, in fact. He was too
wise for this, however, and only asked her, what
did she Tvdsh to express ? That was precisely the
point, she replied ; what did she ?

Then there came a quick perception to him of
the lack of earnestness in her, and a sight of the
grieved face of Bethesda had she seen the light
spirit in which her poignant utterances were to
be answered. His manner grew very grave, and
he spoke to Louise vdth the greatest seriousness,
taking; out Bethesda's letter, and re-reading; her
parts of it, which did not lose any of their pathos
in his rendering.

Soon Louise was weeping on his shoulder,
crying out that she was not worthy to be his
wife, and that she wished she could be dead or
better.

That last is right,' said he, encouragingly.

We must both, wish to be better. My wife has
no need to wish death ; neither ought she. Our
life is given us to live, and to live as nobly as we
can, not to throw away. Look up, my Louise.
Be strong. Take thy pen and write. Answer
this letter as it is written. Tell her frankly
what you feel. It will be received with more
tender comprehension than any one, except God,
could receive it.'

Thus exhorted, Louise wiped her eyes, and
commenced the letter. Her husband sat close
beside her, his hands folded, and his eyes benton
the floor. She looked at him many times
during the first few sentences, which were embarrassed
and confused ; but he did not glance at
her, and she felt the spell of his will to continue.
Presently the volubility of her own emotions
overcame her ; her timidity was swept away
in the stream of expression which seemed to
gush from her very heart. She almost forgot
to whom she was writing, and felt more as if

this were a sacred confession, than a letter to
any one.

Soon Eene found that he could look at her
unnoticed, and he was surprised to find the vivid
interest he took in watching the turbulent expressions
which chased one another across her
face, as her hand swept over page after page.
Tears and fire alternately extinguished one
another in her eyes ; her mouth now" moved
with a passionate exclamation, and again grew
piteous with a sense of her sorrows. And at last,
when she signed her name and threw down her
pen, holding the still wet sheets out to her husband,
she had never appealed to him more.

He took the pages from her, and pressed a
warm kiss on her hand ; a caress which made her
rise abruptly and leave him. She stood in the
embrasured window looking out on the busy
street regardless of everything. ' What will he
think V she was saying to herself, and wishing 
almost wishing  she had not o-iven it to him.

When he had not half finished he came up
behind her, and drawing her arm through his led
her to a seat.

My wife he said in a tone penetrated with
tender comprehension, ' there is much left tous
yet

Then he sat beside her holding her hand while
he completed the epistle. The letter had done
service already, whether it ever reached its
destination or not. It had cleared away much of
the debits of the shattered past, and shown Eene
the love which was sprouting, all unconsciously
to Louise, amid the fragments and the dust now
watered by tears of repentance. Was it too
late ?

At the same time that he had this letter
registered he took from the mail a note forwarded
from Paris. It was from Miss Conover, saying
she was in the city, and would be pleased to see
him. Just at the end there was a perturbing
question : ' Have you heard whether Miss Hamilton

is better ? Her severe illness since New
Year's Day alarms me. I am hoping daily for a
letter from at least Mrs. Trescott.'

Bethesda severely ill, and all communication
broken ! Suffering for bim too ! The whole
fierce tide of his longing set suddenly towards
her again. It was too much to be borne in
inaction. He must hasten to Paris, wherethrough
Miss Conover, he might occasionally
shear of his beloved, his angel, his saint  perhaps
already his saint in heaven !

Louise was now spite recovered, and able to
journey to Paris if she liked, and his leave of
absence had been unduly prolonged. He asked
her the same evening if she would return with
him. It was necessary he should go at once.

Louise looked up at him quickly, and urged
him to stay with her old imperiousness, which he
had generally obeyed. But now he was inflexible.
Indeed his anxiety made him preoccupied
and stern, an effect which Louise was

not long in perceiving. She waited and watched ;
asked until the morning before she should decide ;
went and consulted her mother, who did not aid
her even by contradiction, showing an entire
indifference. Finally Louise took her courage
in both hands, and asked Eene somewhat
abruptly :

Have you news of Bethesda V

His mind was so full of the thought that he
was not surprised.

Yes,' he said, in a tone of such tense self-control
that it was almost harsh ; ' sl friend in
Paris writes me she is severely ill. She may now
even No, she cannot be '

He broke off short, and walked with long
strides to the window. He stood there a longtime
quite motionless, and the twilight deepened
unbroken and chill around them. When he
turned at last Louise spoke in a low voice :

I think I will not go to Paris with you.'

Always do as you like,' he answered, a weary

indifference piercing through the courtesy of his
tone.

She rose and came to stand beside him, where
he had fallen into a chair.

*No, my Eene/ she said, with a gentleness
that roused him. "' It has been, as you say,
always as I liked ; now I hope it will be something
better. It is for your sake, dear Eene,'
she said, suddenly dropping to her knees beside
him ; ' it is for your sake I say I will not go to
Paris. If  if you are anxious, you will not want
me, and  and    -'

Come,' he said simply, putting one arm
around her as she knelt there. ' Come with
me.'

 No, no ; not now she answered, rising.  It
is too soon ; I could not get ready. My maid
T\T.ll not go  I '

Put these things aside, Louise,' said her
husband earnestly. He had risen also, and was
standing facias her. It would be hard for him

VOL. HI. L

to have her there ; he knew that ; but he knew
also it was what Bethesda would have wished.
Don't let little things stand in the way, for it is
right we should be together. Come.'

But her devotion, such as it was, was entirely
personal. ' Eight ' was a chilly word ; he should
go alone.

Perhaps pique strengthened this feeling, and
innate obstinacy fixed it. In any case, she
would not go with him ; their good understanding
was broken ; and it was a relief to him
when in the next mail train he left alone for
bachelor life, and news of Bethesda in Paris.

If to conquer love has tried,
To conquer grief tries more . as all things prove,
For grief indeed is love and grief beside.'

Mrs. Browning,

She cried, " I am the sister of white Faith
Who sits serenely in the open heaven,
To whom I minister ; thus ever driven

On arriving in the city Eene went immediately
to the address Mademoiselle Cinoni lead sent
him. She wsls receiving and singing for a few
friends. It was a piece Rene had last heard
when with Bethesda in London, and now, when
his anxiety and fears had grown with every mile
of the long journey, these familiar tones struck
through him a shivering; discord.

He asked to see Mrs. Conover an instant,
pencilling it on the back of Hs card. She came
out immediately, and urged him to enter, but he
excused himself as not suitably attired.

Can you tell me if Miss Conover has heard
from America as to the health of Miss Hamilton ? '
he asked, then, in a well-schooled voice.

Mrs. Conover's face grew grave and grieved,
as she replied :

Yes ; a letter came from Mrs. Trescott yesterday.
Miss Hamilton is hardly to be expected to
live, I fear. She was such a sweet girl, too !
Mrs. Trescott wrote hastily, and in great distress.
It will be a terrible blow to her. If you will
call tomorrow Guinevere will let you read the
letter,' she added gently, somewhat recognising
in the sudden pallor and gray lips of M. d'Isten
the shock she had given.

Thank you,' he contrived to say. ' At what
hour may I hope V

At eleven, if you like.'

He bowed, not daring; to trust himself to
speak further, and left the house. The coolness
and darkness were a temporary relief to him,
and he hurried away out of the sound of that
haunting;, horrible sono'.

She u'a5 a sweet girl ! This putting it in the
past tense was unendurable. And how could Bethesda's
friend sing when, perhaps  it was true ?

He set his teeth and walked on. The cabman
followed him, clamouring for his pay. Eene
looked up finally, as one might at the buzz of
an insect, and then remembered that he had left
his portmanteau containing the precious package
of letters in the carriage. He sprang in, seized
the handles, and held them tight during the
drive to his hotel. Thevv had been looking for
him, and now the servants rushed out to assist
him, and madame, seeing his stern, tense face,
exclaimed :

 Oh, I hope, Monsieur le Comte, that Madame
la Comtesse '

She is well was the short reply, and, waving
away the servants, he hastened upstairs.

This house ! this room ! this furniture ! The fire
burnings as if she had been there to welcome him !

For a moment a whirling sensation came in
his brain, and the past returned so vividly that
the present was blotted out, and he conceived
himself as just waiting for Bethesda to enter.
A fitful smile played around his lips as he turned
towards the door, and a vague, pleased look came
in his eyes. At that moment he was close upon
the borders of insanity.

Then the whirl came again, and when it left
him he was returned to the bitter, despairing
present. With a groan he flung his arm over
the table, and his head fell upon it, the spring of
life apparently broken.

Presently, however, he sprang up. She was
alive ; she could not be dead ; and why was she
so ill ? For love of him 1 She might be dying,
because to give him up was synonymous with

giving up life. She lead rated her strength too
hicfh. That fragile form could not bear the
stress of such emotions, and such a sacrifice. It
was too much to ask of a human beings. It was
wrong ! it was wicked ! (He was pacing the
floor now.) Perhaps she had never received his
letter ; probably not. She had been prostrated
before it could reach her, and Mabel had in all
likelihood destroyed it. His beloved would not
know that he was endlessly devoted to her : that
nothing either in heaven or hell could detach him
from her ! And she was dino- for want of this
knowledge. Mabel had done it ; Mabel had held
the knife, and cut the throat of this willing; victim.
Mabel," he said, slowly and aloud,  Mabel
shall have her reward.' She had promised to
send him word, to telegraph him, if Bethesda
were ever ill unto death, and had she kept her
promise ? Of course not ! Who could expect
her to keep a promise ? he laughed bitterly,
although she considered the promises made to

her binding in life and in death. There was no
sort of justice in it. There was no justice in
the world ! else why should his heart's whole
treasure lie dying there, and he stand impotent,
delirious, here ?

Something must he done.

He thought no farther then, but bathed his
head, threw open a window, and, seeing his
dense pallor in a mirror he passed, bethought
him of a glass of wine.

He seated himself then, outwardly composed,
but his whole inner beings was a raoino; fire. He
struggled to keep it under, as one would the
flames that threatened those one was trying to
rescue. He bent the whole force of his intellect
and energy of his nature to the aim of finding
some means of aiding his dying one, so many
miles away.

Should he go to her ?

He feared it would be useless. Were she still
alive when the interminable journey was over

he would not be admitted to her side. Even
throno-h Marcott he could not reach her. Her
sister or her aunts would be watching; With her
day and night, and Mrs. Trescott had prejudiced
every one against him ; she had said as much in
her letters. Perhaps, too, Bethesda could not
endure the sudden revulsion of seeing; him, and
what could he say ? Only that he was hers for
life and death, to dispose of as she chose, and
she had settled that question already. She
knew, without his assurance, that her ashes
would be obeyed.

If he could not go to her, what then ?

Telegraph ? "Write  Through Marcott a
word from him might reach her. What should
that word be ? What could it be, except a
repetition of what she already knew, unless his
conditions should change ? Well, were they
inflexible 1 A divorce was impossible ; the
church had taken care of that. Besides, he
shrank from such a thing with an unconquerable

repugnance. So, lie knew, would Betliesda.
Then, there was nothing he could do ?

A thought, a wild, romantic thought I To
go to America, to take Marcott's place ! To see
her, to wait upon her ; sometime, perhaps, to
slip a little word into her ear of encouraging
devotion 1

The possibility glittered before him like an
enchantment. Who could tell what his mere
presence might do for her 1 He would take
such exquisite care of her, and he could act his
part so well ! He pored over this suggestion,
amplified it into the minutest details, imagined
his actions, his self-control, his foiling discovery,
until he was almost resolved upon immediately
undertaking it. Then suddenly came the question
: ' Would she like it ? ' and his fairy structure
fell into abject demolition.

For she would not. As soon as the first
surprise and joy were past, her conscience, of
whose strength he had some knowledge now.

would disapprove, and lie would be adding to
lier trials instead of decreasing them. She would
send him away, whatever it cost her, and tell
him to return to Louise.

Louise  he had not thought of her. But she
was to be considered ; yes, decidedly to be considered.
They had commenced a new life; the
future, with patience, promised more than the
past had ever done, and this was through his
saint's ministrations. Louise must not be disregarded,
nor Bethesda's commands to actively
help her.

As he reached this conclusion, which surrendered
him to a sense of his incapacity and
weariness, a servant knocked, and said a gentleman
waited below who had already called twice,
while monsieur the count was absent.

His name '? '

The gentleman declined to give a name, but
beofoed to assure monsieur the count that it was
most important they should meet. Eene was

about to dismiss the man impatiently when the
thought suggested itself: If he should come
from Bethesda *?

 Tell him he may enter were his immediate
words.

He went into the next room and removed
the traces of his journey hastily. When he
returned to the salon, there, bending over a
book, was a man he had good cause to know.
A messenger from Bethesda indeed ! It was the
lover of Louise.

His guest turned and saw him as the scorn of
this thought flashed across his features.

Monsieur ! ' exclaimed the young officer
hastily, while his face suffused with a most unmilitary
blush,  believe you see in me only one
who desires to render you a service in token of
his gratitude.'

 You owe me nothing,' said M. d'Isten coldly.

Pardon ; I owe you what a soldier values
more than his life  his reputation.'

A fine smile just touched M. chasten's lip,
but 

To what am I indebted for this visit, sir ? '
was all he said.

To an earnest desire to serve you replied
the soldier eagerly. ' I have a piece of information
which I am convinced you will value. It
should be for you alone.' He glanced as he
spoke at the open door through which M. dTsten
had entered.

We are alone. I cannot imagine what you
would say, but be seated said Eene, with careless
politeness. ' I have an engagement shortly ;
until then I listen.'

The young officer bit his lip. This was
haughty treatment ; presently he should have
the pleasure of seeing it change.

If your time is brief, monsieur, pray allow
me to put aside ceremony.' M. dTsten bowed.
You were married in the chapel of the Chateau
despisers.'

 I believe you were a Avitness/ returned M.
d'Isten, with a touch of ironical disdain. It
caused a hot flush to sting his companion's face,
under the impulse of which he exclaimed
abruptly :

I witnessed, perhaps, a ceremony, but no
marriage

Kene looked up and down the stalwart
form before him. Was the man mad ? Or 
could it be that a private marriage had taken
place between Louise and this man before the
ceremony ' as he called it ? Impossible. Louise,
would long since have flown to her lover had
this been true. And yet  her words, that she
could free herself and him.

He looked up sharply.

Explain yourself,' he said.

It has been a strange thing to me, monsieur,'
began the officer, now more at ease, ' that during
these many years of what you thought marriage,
you have never discovered that the ceremony

was illegal, and that you are not the liusbancl of
Louise Manners.'

Be careful, sir ! Eemember that the honour
of the lady you mention has been long in my
keeping, and I may add  to you  that I have
kept it well. "What proofs can you bring of this
curious assertion ? How have you convinced
yourself that my marriage was illegal V

By acquaintance with the simple facts that
the father of your supposed bride was a Spaniard,
which made his daughter a Spaniard, and that
you are a Frenchman. Facts equally well knoT\TL
to you, undoubtedly, but what has strangely
escaped you is that for a Frenchman to marry a
foreigner, on foreign soil, is illegal, and the union
is void according* to law.'

A pause. What a revelation for Bene ! What
a possibility ! It staggered him for a moment,
then :

These are assertions only, sir ; what are your
proofs V

The officer rose and took from the table a
bulky volume he had brought. It was marked
at a certain page, and he handed it to M. d'Isten
in silence.

Eene read. It was true. This was a volume
of the Code, and here it was in formal language
the incantation which broke his fetters to
Louise and left him free.

The shock stunned him. The miraculous overthrow
of accustomed conditions, the possibilities
flashing like lightning about him, the incredulity
of surprise confounded by proof, all combined
to blur his mind. He could not tell if it were
pain or pleasure he felt ; he was sure it was confusion.


He had enough presence of mind to keep his
face under control, so that even the curious eyes
before him could read little of what passed within;
but now he rose and walked to the window, and
stood there a few moments.

Louise not his wife ? What was she, then ?

What was tie ? Bethesda's spirit asked ; he, who
had prided himself on his untarnished life. They
could both be retrieved by an instant marriage
now ; but  to marry her whom he had so long
felt a burden, from whom, hardly an hour ago,
he was longing to be free that he might give himself
wholly to Bethesda, and now to make use of
his new conditions only to put himself back into
those old ones, and, in so doing, to deny Bethesda,
perhaps to kill her ?

But this was no time for such questions.
What was he going to say to that young man
there ? Hum ; he would test him.

He turned and walked slowly back to the
table. The officer was watching him with an
assumption of deference, under which some
triumph lurked. Rene d'Isten met his eyes with
the most probing of glances.

Since when have you known this, monsieur V

Not long. Monsieur le Comte ; only since you

brought Mademoiselle Manners '

VOL. in. M

Call her by the name she has so long worn,
if you please interrupted Eene haughtily.

Since you and your wife, then, monsieur,
came to Paris. If I had known before that, I
fear I should have given you trouble.' He smiled
in a manner Rene at once pronounced odious.

What was your object in telling me this V he
asked sternly.

As I have had the honour to inform you, I
wished to pay off somewhat of the debt of obligation
you have laid upon me. It is a debt of
honour, sir.'

And you thought you would be doing me a
favours a fine scorn in the word, ' to tdl me that
what I have regarded as a sacred obligation for
years is not of a feather's value V

I had reason to believe, monsieur, that the
knowledge of your freedom would not be unwelcome
to you.'

You dared to think '

Pardon, monsieur,' interrupted the officer

hardily : ' your ceaseless watching of me has not
been entirely unreciprocated. I knew you had
met a lady whom '

Beware of touching such a subject even in
your thoughts !' interrupted M. d'Isten sternly.
This matter is a most distasteful one ; let us
finish it. Be so kind as to answer me a question.
Are you aware if my  if Louise knows this law ? '

She has never known of it from me, monsieur,
nor has she given me any occasion to
suspect that she knew it.'

Thanks. We need not deny that we are both
familiar with the fact that you loved her, and
that, had you been able, you would have snatched
her away at any time '

Before last March ; not since,' interposed his
companion, with a ho\\\ ' I was too deeply in
your debt.'

Very well,' with an impatient gesture ; ' before
last March, then. Now I ask you, as man
to man, did you, knowing she was free, seek her

honourably ? Would you, if you had the opportunity,
marry her tomorrow V

He turned his penetrating glance full upon his
interlocutor, and under its blaze the man's bold eyes
fell. He could not, without a sense of shame, speak
here what had seemed to him a matter of course
elsewhere. But the remembrance of this reassured
him. He recovered himself, and gave a short laugh,
which caused his answer to be almost unneeded.

Really, monsieur, your offer sounds magnanimous,
but I am hardly prepared to sacrifice my
honour to marry an unwedded wife.'

Then Eene d'Isten drew himself up, and looked
every inch the aristocrat.

I understand. You would woo her to dishonour,
dishonouring yourself no less ; you were
ardent in that, because the world would not point
its finger at you, and cry : Shame ! But now 
let me finish, if you please, sir  now, when the
opportunity is offered you to say if you would
shelter under your name the woman you pretend

to love, you become finical and dainty. I am
olad to know T\diat your love is worth : I have
wasted much good sympathy upon you. But I
should not have looked for anything different.
It is like you, brave soldier that you are !'

Monsieur ! '

'Your precious "honour"! saved once, because
my wife desired it. It was not worth it.
Allow me to bid you good evening.'

I shall have the pleasure, then, at last, of
sending you my second. I brook no insults, sir.'

Spare yourself the trouble. I shall receive
no second. I do not fight  certainly not with
one who has proved himself base. Adieu.'

The officer strode up close to the haughty
count, and looked in his face insolently. In one
hand was his orlove. He was about to raise it
when a better thought struck him, a finer insult.

Which shall you marry V he sneered, and
with a coarse lauo'h he turned on his heel and
left the room.

Break, break this bitter silence ! speak unto me once again !
Tell me, shall I ere behold thee 1 tell me, do I wait in vain ?
It is well for us to suffer, it is well for us to wait,
Well to swing, like little children, all our life on death's loose
gate.' J. Miller Hangman.

Exactly at eleven the next morning M. d' 1st en
presented himself at Miss Conover's door. She
had been prepared by her mother to find him
much changed, but his appearance shocked her.
She wondered why he should look so ill. She
held a letter in her hand, and, after the . first
grave courtesies were exchanged, she gave it to
him, turning away while he read it, with an
instinctive consideration.

He went over it again and again, until he
knew it by heart ; not for that end, but because

it was SO hopeless. Bethesda was day and night
either insensible or in excruciating pain, wrote
Mrs. Trescott. His Esda ! his fragile love !
Did he go to her now it would only be to find
her beyond the reach of sorrow or consolation.

At last Miss Conover, vaguely alarmed, went
forward and spoke his name. He turned, and
she put out her hand impulsively :

Ah, it is a sorrow to you also, monsieur.'

He could not reply, but bent over her hand
in silence. Presently, however, the sympathy
of a common grief somewhat loosened the tense
cords around his heart, and she could catch a
glimpse of the reverential tenderness with which
he regarded Bethesda, and which, for the time
being, caused him to forget all else.

Evra did not think to be indignant. The
perception of the agony it must be to this man
not to have a shred of communication at such a
time forced itself in upon her, and she was compassionate
towards him. Her Lily had thought

him worthy of her friendship, and she would be
his friend now.

After this M. d'Isten visited Miss Conover
frequently, each day looking more worn and
haggard, for the news from America continued
to be of the worst,  that is, when there was any
news. The long suspense between the scraps
Mabel and Marcott wrote was the hardest of all
to bear. The two yearning friends came even
to look upon the hour when they should hear of
Bethesda's death as one of relief, for then she
would no longer be suffering these agonies, too
painful to be imagined, and they would be out
of the clutches of a despairing hope.

A gnawing indecision also wore upon Eene.
He had been to a lawyer, and convinced himself
beyond any further doubt that he was free.
But free to do what ? He was surprised at himself
that the matter was so difficult of solution.
A year before he would have thought this release
a God-sent justice, and accepted it as such.

Now he could not help but think of Louise's
cruel position, and her claims paramount almost
to his OTTi. Conscience, once awakened by
contact with Bethesda's, could not again be
lulled to sleep. He found himself in the terrible
situation of divided forces. To which did he
owe himself ? To her who held his heart, or to
her whom he had called wife ? Was body more
than soul ? Did the fact of his having been the
husband of Louise condemn him to marry her
now ? Did he not rather owe it to Bethesda
that his new-found freedom should be laid at her
feet '? But then perhaps already she was beyond
any joy he could give her, beyond hope, beyond
could she be beyond love ?

Her illness served Bethesda well with Eene,
and also with Guinevere, whose jealous nature
had at times been aroused by the sight of
anguish greater even than her own. But she
could never censure Bethesda. This distant
martyr, who might at any instant become 

might already have become-a soul in heaven, it
was impossible to associate with angry, or
jealous, or sensuous thoughts. This body,
mangled in the conflict, although so dear to
each, was seen to be as nothing to the strength
of that ardent spirit which soared above it and
them. They heard of her patience and fortitude,
her unselfishness and spirituality, and they felt
that she was a being bound so slightly to earth
that the touch of a rough or unworthy thought
might break the chrysalis, and leave her to soar
white-winged to God.

They were both Catholics, and many times
they might have been seen, if not at the same
church, at the same hour praying for her whose
body might be alive or dead. For Eene had
found that there was something more powerful
to pray to than Esda. His saint was enough for
him, but, when she needed intercession, whom
was there to go to but God ?

And when he left the holy shadow of the

church he would go home to write to Louise
kindly, solicitously : showing an unusual tenderness
as of one about to go away for ever. He
left the matter in God's hands. If his prayers
were answered, and Bethesda recovered, he
would go to her and leave Louise. Spirit was
stronger than matter, soul more divine than
body, love the truest law. So, whatever it cost
Louise, Bethesda should not miss her rights.
She had never done anything to cause her to
miss them. Louise had ; and yet he never
felt so forgiving; and lenient to Louise as
when he was caressing the idea of Bethesda's
recovery.

What made his thoughts especially gentle
with her who had been his wife was the fact
that, through one whom he had trusted for many
years, he learned that the doughty officer, who had
so eagerly sought to pay off ' a debt of gratitude,'

had returned to M , and tried to meet Louise

where he could speak to her alone. Failing in

that, as Eene had long since taken care he should
fail, he sent her a letter saying that a word from
him could free her from bonds she had long endured,
and that could he gain an interview with
her for only one moment, this word should bespoken,
and her heart assured that his devotion
was as unceasing as it had been patient.

Louise had received this letter through some
clever intrigue which had prevented the trusty
friend from securing it en route, but it had done
little harm, for it had not been opened. It was
returned by Louise herself to its writer, whom
it was allowed to reach, and who had almost immediately
left the place.

My poor, dear Louise ! ' said Eene to himself,
as he folded the letter containing this news. He
felt very tenderly towards her as one does towards
a child who has been naughty and unmanageable,
but who is receiving hard punishment.
Poor child ! it would go hard with her. And
this fellow was a dastard.

This news only made him more eager for
decisive word from America. Such upheaval and
suspense were peculiarly unendurable to him. He
was unable to adjust himself to anything, without
the likelihood of being; thro"\\Ti ofi" his balance
at the next instant. He was the plaything of
fate, the buffet of chance. But this fate and
chance would have a divine hand to impel them,
and he would abide its decision. If Bethesda
died, hope was for ever shut to him. He could
sacrifice himself in a perpetual suttee and find it
sweet, because she would approve. Louise
should know what this ' word of freedom ' was,
and choose him or reject him with open-eyed
knowledge. But he could do nothing till he

o o

heard from Bethesda. His whole soul came
back to this centre of longing;. Let her recover,
and then  happiness !

One day towards the end of March, however,
Guinevere received word that the end could be
only a few hours delayed. Beth even then was

lying in a swoon, which had lasted for hours, and
from which, the physicians said, she would awake
only to a few moments' consciousness before she
died. They were willing she should go ; the persecuted
child would be safer there, wrote Mabel.
No love, not the most devoted, could shield so
tender a soul in this wicked world. Since there
were demons here who delighted in inflicting
torture on the best, her friends could only be
glad of her release.

The paper fluttered from Guinevere's fingers
and fell to the floor. She had not understood
the last phrases : she had only felt that there
was no longer suspense nor hope.

As she knelt before the crucifix hanging by
her bed, a knock came at the door. Was it
the final tidings ?

Monsieur le Comte d'Isten craves to see
mademoiselle,' said the maid.

Give him this, and say I cannot see him,'
said Guinevere, thrusting Mrs. Trescott's letter

into the girl's hand, and enclosing herself again
with her solitary grief.

Mademoiselle is in despair, monsieur,' said
the maid presently in the next room ; ' she sends
you this, and says she is too ill to see you.
She '

M. d'Isten had not heard her. He snatched
the meaning from the blotted page before him,
and when he realised what it meant, the maid
shrank away from before his face and closed the
door stealthily.

The insuperable loss came upon him with a
fierceness which quite obliterated his reason. He
laid all the blame on Mabel, and the desire for
vengeance comines from his mother's race made
him reckless then. His was the wrath which does
not explode but kills. An explosion may injure
many, but the bullet flies surer to the one heart.

A few hours later he returned  he had rushed
out of the house  T\ith a new resolution in his
face. He insisted on seeing Miss Conover ;

bribed the maid conclusively, and gave her such
an adroit message to deliver that the artist's
seclusion was ended ; and she hastened into the
drawing-room, her hair dishevelled, and her
cheeks all tear-stained and wan.

What is it, what is it ? ' she cried.

I am convinced Bethesda is better. Send a
telegram to her sister and see. She will answer
it ; I know she will.'

There is no use ; my darling is dead ! '
moaned disappointed Guinevere.

She is not. Trust me. Miss Conover. Only
telegraph, and you will see that I am right.
Miss Margaret Hamilton will answer you ; she
might not me. I beseech you, try.'

As you like, but it will only be to hear of
her death.'

Consent was all M. d'Isten wished. Action
was always a relief to him, and to whom is not
hope a tonic ? He spoke a few helpful words,
borne up by an unreasoned feeling which would

CHAP. X.] BETHESDA. 177

not acknowledge fear, and left Guinevere roused
to hope also. He haunted the office until the
reply came, late at night.

She lives. We have hope.'

The blackness was passed. Such a dark
period could not come again ; it would always
be illumined by the reflection of this relief.

Miss Conover gave him both hands as she saw
his face and heard the good words which verified
his hope.

My sweet, living Lily ! ' thought Evra, when
M. d'Isten left, a great change in his face and
carriage and voice, ' we both love you, but I will
support and comfort you. He cannot, and I can.
1 am a woman and so you will not fear me.'

And Eene, walking under the starry spring
skies, thinking of a year before, and the resurrection
promised to-night, made a vow that he would
win Bethesda to the resurrection of love as of life,
without allowing her happiness to be flawed by
the knowledge that it caused any one pain.

VOL. III. N

'Ask God for truth and He will give the divine in answer.'

Peace comes, not by having naught to suffer, but by surmounting
suffering.

Eighteen montis passed. Bethesda Hamilton
had very slowly recovered from the terrible illness
which had almost released her soul. What
turned the trembling balance was a perception
of her cowardice in wishing, as she had done at
first, to die. Should she be so selfish as to extinguish
the light her fiery sufferings might be
to some other erring souls ? She must live to
make her pains and her gains a beacon ofi" the
rocks of dishonour and to the haven of morality.
Her first thought now became in each new
trial : How can I make this serve others '? She
constantly sought truth, no longer for herself

CHAP. XI.] BETHESDA. 179

alone ; but a patient endurance, an active resignation,
an offering of all her joys and sorrows
to the service of her fellow-men, brought their
own sublime reward. It was worth the whole
of her illness in its hope alone ; it was the gladness
of the birth of things immortal : for in her
soul was that grandest of all conceptions, the
belief in a loving personal God.

The great preaching of her soul after truth
and rectitude had been but the dawn which
heralds the approach of day, and presently she
looked forward with an almost ecstatic vision to
the time when the world should be purified of
its sins, and the Christian religion be comprehended
in reverence, as well as felt by faith,
until no side of its divine beauty would be dim,
but all believed with that assurance which is
beyond faith, because it knows.

Naturally, for she was still a weak woman,
there were desolate hours when the uplifting-pinions
of aspiration and hope drooped helpless

~ \

at her sides, their snowy plumage hardly withheld
from the dust ; when her passionate nature
cried out for her lover and would not be stilled.
She remembered, and memory's very sweetness
was well-nigh unendurable bitter. For there are
many broken threads which seem but a hairsbreadth
apart, yet the chasm which separates
them is deep as death, and wide as eternity.

But the strong instinct of Bethesda's nature
towards right as of a plant towards light, always
won the victory, and she recognised how only
the oblivion of ourselves in a higher life than
our own makes us strong and serene ; only advancing
over the bridge which leads from passion
to renunciation will take us from the malarious
districts of individual life to the invigorating
regions of universality.

She was aided in this by living constantly
under the combined influences of Mrs. Stanhope
and Margaret. Mabel, soon after Bethesda's
recovery, had married ; not loving nor professing

to love, but glad to be ' surely first to sore
one,' as she said, and feeling that she could
make her husband happier than he would be
without her.

He was in every particular her counterpart.
He was a self-poised and strong man, and upon
first meeting attracted Bethesda's confidence.
She saw that, with time, his consistent force
and intrepid devotion might subdue Mabel's
impetuous inconsistencies, and give the ecjuipose
which she so much needed both for development
and happiness. His love for Mabel, if not
wholly wise, was neither a blind infatuation.
He had weighed his chances with a not unsteady
hand, and had thrown his whole fortune on the
hope of T\TLnning her absolutely some day. He
had seen that to do this irrevocability was essential.
The inevitable, which she had never dared
to face, should be her possessor, and hold her
for once firm to a purpose  his purpose, if not
hers. When there was once a solidarity of

interests declared between them, her lifelong
instincts would play into his hands.

So they had married and gone to their new
home in California, ' so far west that it is almost
east said Mabel ; but there were only a few
swift months for Mr. Eeming to use in accomplishing
his hoped-for end, when Mabel, in
giving birth to a girl-baby, died. Bethesda was
there and supported her aunt to the last, and it
was to her Mrs. Eeming left her child. The
father was quite willing to carry out the mother's
request, for he almost hated the infant which
had stolen his precious wife's life. He had,
indeed, at once gone away on a long trip, sailing
direct to China, whence there was little prospect
as yet of his returning.

The Misses Hamilton, meantime, with their
new charge, had decided to take the house and
grounds adjoining the Stanhopess', and towards
the end of the second October they were settled
in their own establishment, with Aunt Agatha

at hand to call upon, and the lives of all flowing
in that sympathetic unison which forms the
sweetness of life.

To Bethesda, such an experience as her present
one of quiet domesticity was peculiarly
restful. The longer she lived in the natural
conditions of life, the more shuddering did she
look back on the unsheltered past and rejoice
that it was over. When she had first recovered
from her illness she had thought there must bean
impenetrable strangeness which would separate
her, like a nun's veil, from the society in
which she moved ; but the foolish notion vanished
under the clear rays of common-sense and
contact with the world in its usual phases which
Mrs. Stanhope had exerted herself to bring
around her nieces.

Bethesda soon found that her charms were
here neither sought by artists to copy, nor the
cause of despair to mad lovers. A certain equipoise
of character, which increased daily under

the healthy regime of her moral surroundings,
and interest rather in thought than persons,
sufficed to keep on the boundaries of pleasant
acquaintance the men who were attracted to her.
Moreover, there was a sense of completion about
her which robbed her of the charm a fancy-free
maidenhood alone possesses. Men found her
interested by larger questions than mere personal
ones, and the magnetism which formerly drew to
love, now drew to intellectual attainment.

She thought much, and had never had such
opportunities to bring out the best in her as
during the winter, when the philosophic and
literary conversations which made Mrs. Stanhope's
parlour an old time salon, stimulated her
to activity, while giving her the guidance of
noble minds. She would listen and glow with
the exercise of her highest faculties now, as she
had used to do in beholding fine scenery, and
felt her insignificance beside these towering
intellects, as she had beside the Pyramids.

D

At present objective life was all her study,
for her personal strength and attention were
required for the baby and Margaret, whose health
had been strained by the long nursing, and who
clung to her sister with that close pressure which
best staunchest a wound. And Bethesda felt that
no looking back with sorrow, nor forward misapprehension
must sap the health which was
dedicated to the serving of others.

Her manner of regarding the past was thus
significantly altered. She had heard nothing
from Eene since the telegram whose contents had
been communicated to her when it was thought
that she would die. The words had often reassured
her. Eene and Louise might even at
this moment be living together in Paris, realising
that ' he only earns his Kfe who daily conquers
it anew.' This was her most hopeful thought.
Of Eene's letter and Madame dTsten's she knew
nothing. They had been received by Mabel and
disposed of as she saw fit. Bethesda often

wondered if Louise were angry, but patiently
bore the lack of knowledge, feeling that all she
could do had been done. She understood that she
must recognise clearly Eene's errors and her own,
and reach upwards to touch him only as she
embraced all, he being farthest of all. She was
sure that God would take care of Eene as of herself
with perfect tenderness, upholding them if
they did right, leading them to repentance if
they did wrong, which was not a lesser reliance.
She did not wish herself or others to escape any
suffering it were better they should have. Had
she felt God would extend a mercy to her to
cover instead of eradicating her sins, she would
not have trusted him as she did. Meantime
she knew that, if she gave her life into his
hands, he would convert all her evil into
good, by the divine alchemy of his regenerative
power.

In the latter part of October Mr. Stanhope
returned from a trip to New York, and mentioned

incidentally having met a gentleman who
seemed to know Bethesda.

He is the new French Secretary of Legation
in Washington, I understand. It may be he has
only heard your name in connection nth your
writing,  those stories of yours have made some
sensation, my dear,  but I formed an opinion
that he had met you personally.'

Who was he ? ' asked Bethesda steadily,
though her heart answered before him.

His name was d'Isten. I have his card somewhere.
He had a title of some kind ; it seems
to me they said marquis. Do you know him V

Aunt Mabel and I met him abroad,' replied
Bethesda calmly. ' Was his wife with him ? '

His wife ? No, I did not know he had one.
That is natural enough, however,' he went on
after a momentary pause. * A man does not say
much of private affairs to a stranger. I did not
mention that you were any connection of mine,
only that I had heard of you. He seemed

interested in what I did say. He admires your
writings, and, if I am not mistaken, said he had
translated one of the stories into their French
Magazine  what do you call it ? '

Revue des Deux Montes

Yes. He seemed to have literary tastes, and
had a number of anecdotes to tell about literary
persons. He was quite entertaining, but too
foreign to suit me. I don't see how you and
Mabel managed to live so long over there.'

The new secretary of legation was soon forgotten.
Even Bethesda succeeded in silencing, for
the time, the importunate voice within her which
she had not fancied could clamour so loudly
for itself alone after months of victorious subjection.


For it had been many months, many years it
seemed to her as she lay awake that night, since
that Christmas when her decision to deny herself
and Eene all, had been made. It was more than
two years since they had met, and once more

they were on the same side of the Atlantic.
"What did this mean '? A hundred perturbing
possibilities suggested themselves as unfolding
of the present. Deeds draw an endless chain of
consequences ; what was the next link which
would come to her ?

Finally Bethesda put the thoughts all aside
as the dawn came creeping in. She remembered
what Mrs. Stanhope had said to her once :

The course of events cannot be disturbed,
nor evaded. Do as near right as you can, and
leave the rest to God.'

She sent for Marcott the next day, and asked
him to give her back the paper Tvdth which she
had entrusted him before she was ill.

It is impossible for me to do so at once,
madame,' he replied, ' I left it with a banker in
New York.'

Why so ? When was that ? '

Before madame your aunt was married,
madame. Perhaps Madame Eeming communicated

to my mistress a rebuke she gave me ?
She wished to discharge me.'

I have heard of it.' There had indeed been
a stiff battle between Mabel and Agatha on this
subject, but Agatha had won.

My mistress will understand that then the
surest way of fulfilling her wishes was to put the
paper out of my hands.'

Very well. I have no doubt you did it for
the best. Send for it now, however, and give it
to me immediately.'

My mistress has not lost confidence in me V
ventured Marcott humbly.

Not in the least. You have been devoted
to me and my interests. Those papers were only
given you to deliver in case of my speedy death.
I now wish to have them again myself.'

As my mistress desires,' said Marcott obediently,
but he lingered.

 Have you anything to say to me V asked
Miss Hamilton presently.

If my mistress would permit,  it may be of
service to my mistress to know that the person
whose name was on her letter is in America.'

Very well. You have done your duty in
telling me, and now I wish you to consider it
your duty not to mention him again. That is
all I shall want of you now.'

It was a week after she had received and
destroyed the sealed paper she had requested,
and which contained all Eene's letters to her, as
well as one from her to him, none of which, she
was sure, had been tampered with, that there
came a call at the telephone from Mr. Stanhope.

Mrs. Stanhope was away, and Uncle Ealeigh
on such occasions took his meals with his nieces,
feeling perfectly at home there. Now he asked,
with customary formality, if he could bring up a
friend to dine? The answer was: 'Certainly
but in a few moments another call was made,
and Bethesda asked for.

It is the gentleman I told you of meetings in

New York. He lias excellent letters from
Washington, and I would like to offer him some
hospitality. Do you object in any way to his
coming to your house ? '

Bethesda felt all the blood leave the surface of
her body, and crowd to her heart For an instant
she could not speak or move. It had, in spite of
all, taken her completely by surprise. She had
not imagined him as making so bold a stroke.

Please postpone the invitation,' she contrived
at last to say.

Very well,' replied Mr. Stanhope, and closed
the current.

Bethesda went into the study, and sat down
at her desk and let her head fall on her hands.
What was she to do ? What could she say that
would not be unjust, and yet would keep
them separated ? For this had become the one
urgent aim, excluding all others. She could not
see him unless she knew more, it was her duty
not to meet him ; and, moreover, she could not.

Then she felt Margaret's arms around her, the

visible presence of tender sympathy.

Margaret she said abruptly, for she had no
secrets from her sister, * Monsieur d'Isten is in
the city. He has letters of introduction to uncle,
and was to have come here to dine to-nio'ht. I
asked uncle to postpone it, so as to give me at
least time to think. Now, what am I to do V

Uncle will trust you Tthout a word of
question. You have only to say you do not
wish to meet M. d'Isten.'

But the question is. What does it mean ?
He comes here without his wife ; he has excellent
letters of introduction to uncle, and what
does it mean ? What, rather, can I do to keep
him away V

You must keep him away by some means,
that is sure, but I don't think ani:hino'"more
than an expression of your desire not to meet
him will be necessary. Aunt Agatha will be
home tomorrow, and then she can entertain

VOL. III. O

him, and uncle will take delicate care of you ; he
would respect your least wish.'

True, and how good it is to be protected, to
be sheltered! I understand better now that I
have spoken to you. It startled me so at first,
I could hardly think.'

Mr. Stanhope did not mention M. d'Isten's
name until Bethesda first inquired about him,
which was after Marcott had placed the dessert
upon the table. She was looking peculiarly
lovely to-night, thought her uncle, although a
little tired ; but her voice was quite natural as
she mentioned his message.

'By whom was M. d'Isten introduced?' she
asked.

By Mr. , an old friend of mine in the

cabinet. He writes in the highest terms of this
Frenchman, whom, it seems, he knew in Parison
some diplomatic business. Here is the letter.
Read it after dinner. He says any attentions
given to him would be considered as a personal

favour. M. d'lsten lias made a powerful friend
there.'

Has he, indeed?' exclaimed Margaret, with
frank curiosity. ' Who then is this remarkable
man ? Is he vouno* or old 1 Married or sinoie ?
Have you seen him here ?'

Mr. Stanhope glanced at Bethesda in some
surprise ; she had not told her sister then ? He
answered readily, however :

He brought me the letter and stayed sometime
in my office. He is well-bred and intelligent,
but a reserved man, 1 should say. He
seems desirous to please. If he is married he
did not say so ; I should have liked him better
if he had. I should have preferred, too, his
mentioning Bethesda, since he met her abroad,
and probably learned in Washington that I washer
uncle. I like a man who isn't afraid to claim
acquaintance vdtk anybody. However, with
such a letter I should like to pay him some
attention.'

He looked at Bethesda keenly. She said
nothing for a moment, then lifted inscrutably
candid eyes to his face, and replied in a low,
steady voice :

Uncle, you know Aunt Mabel and I became
acquainted with Monsieur d'Isten abroad. We
liked him very much for a time, then there
came up a  a misunderstanding, I will call it,
and the acquaintance was entirely broken off.
Aunt Mabel never forgave him, and, although I
think she was unjust to him, I am not sufficiently
well satisfied with his actions, or our
own, to wish to meet him  now. You might
tell him that you would be glad to invite him
here, but I had asked you not to do so. Yes,
this would be best, I think it would make him
clearly understand, and would avert our meeting
in the future.'

There was an uncontrollable sadness in her
voice now which stirred both her listeners. Mr.
Stanhope filled her glass with wine, and his

hand trembled in so doing. To cover it he
said quickly :

Just as you choose. There is no need forme
to mention you at all, if you prefer.'

Yes, you had better say I requested this of
you, unless it would be awkward for you V

Oh no ; if you think it best, I can easily
manage it. I told him when your message came
that I was obliged to delay the dinner, and that
I would call at his hotel in the morning. I can
give him your message then, although not in the
form of one of course, and, at the same time, tell
him I expect my wife home at noon, and ask
him to dine with us the next day. That will be
all right. You need not worry at all.'

It was a quiet but hard evening to Bethesda.
Neighbours came in, and they sat talking in the
library Adhere Bethesda herself had closed the
lower shutters which Marcott, for one reason or
another, had left open.

As they went away, quite late, Bethesda stood

a few moments in the balmy, Indian-summer air,
looking up at the stars which had so often seemed
to watch her destiny. So, he was a marquis.
Well, his father had been an old man two years
before, but it must have been a deep grief to
the son. He loved his father. And his wife ?
Those were the two ties which held him bound
to Europe, he had once told her, and now he

was here

A man's figure stirred under the trees opposite.
She turned hastily and went in.

Our life is lent
From first to last, the whole, for this experiment,
Of proving what I say,  that we ourselves are true I '

Robert Browning.

That same evening; Marcott stood before his
former master, betokening by profuse salutations
this pleasure at again being able to speak with one
whom he had loved from boyhood.

Has your mistress mentioned me in your
hearing?' were Eene dTsten's first words when
the delighted o-reetincrs had been received, and
very pleasantly too.

It is just now that she called me and gave
me a warning, monsieur le marquis,' replied Mar-cot.
' She commanded me to carry no word, or
letter, or message whatever from you to her.

monsieur ; she said that if I did so that moment
would be my last in her service. Pardon me,
monsieur le marquis, but you desire me to repeat
her words V

Certainly ; and you think she meant them V
She never uses such words idly, monsieur.'
Very likely not.' He sat and thought a few
moments in silence. Did this indicate disapproval
? Or was it fear of herself as well as of
him ? In any case he could not but admire the
position she took, knowing no more than she
did.

Sit down,' he said presently to the man waiting
before him. ' Tell me all I should wish to
know.'

Thereupon ensued a tale which Bethesda would
have been astounded to hear. Not that it was
untrue; quite the contrary. So accurate had
been the man's perceptions of all that came
within his scope of mind, so acute his surmises,
and so excellent his memory, that she would have

felt her life unveiled of at least all its outer
coverings before Eene d'Isten's keen eyes. Mar-cot
was a kind of genius in his way ; he would
have made his fortune as a detective ; his master
had known and chosen well when he gave him
this position of confidence.

He praised him now, and added a more convertible
reward, and then asked carelessly :

Did she appear to suspect anything about the
letter you left T\ith your so-called banker V

Nothing, monsieur le marquis. She has too
white a soul to suspect'

 So you are thoroughly devoted to her, eh ?
Well, you are right, Marcott. I wish I could be
in your place.'

She is the kindest of ladies, monsieur ; I
thank you for giving me so good a position.'

And she has no protestants, you say ?'

None, monsieur. There are many who would
gladly be so did she permit it, but there is an air
de reine about her which prevents impertinence.'

Is she too delicate yet to bear a surprise V
Ah, monsieur, she is very frail ! And she
has suffered so much ! No one who did not see
her during that dreadful illness knows what
woman can endure. Be careful of her, I beseech
you, monsieur ! '

Tranquillise yourself, Marcott. She is in no
danger from me.' Then, with a knowledge of the
man's French heart, he gave him the most salient
bits of news from his home and people.

And monsieur your father died ? '

Only a short time since. He had a return
of the old paralysis from his wounds, and was inconstant
danger of death, for which he came to
pray. I was with him from the first. He spoke
of you, Marcott, only the day before he died.
You shall choose your own place on the estate
when you have done what there is to do here, or
if your mistress should dismiss you. I know I
can trust you, but be discreet; don't run any
risks. If she should question you She

never has, you say ? Well, it may come, and
then be careful what you say. I am here on
diplomatic business, and shall remain indefinitely,
in America, I mean. I came to this city to
make the acquaintance of her uncle. The circumstances
of my life have changed, much
changed. Specify my father's death if she presses
you closely. Don't mention Madame d'Isten. If
she asks for her, say you have heard nothing, but
assure her, with significance, that my circumstances
are altered. Come again tomorrow
evening at this same hour, if possible. I expect
to dine out, and may wish to give you new instructions.
Leave the shutters open every even-nor
; I saw your mistress close them to-nio'ht.
She is taller than she was, and her hair seems
darker. Has she chant-ed much during her illness
? I could not see her face.'

She is more beautiful than ever, monsieur
le marquis. She has the serenity of a saint, 
ah, you should have seen her, monsieur, with

Madame Eeming !  and her tenderness to that
baby '

'Bien, lien, Marcott. I see plainly that if a
man cannot hope to be a hero to his valet, your
mistress is nothing less than perfect to you !
And I believe you are not far wrong.'

The next day Mrs. Stanhope returned and
found her husband so anxious to do something
at once for this well-introduced stranger that
Aunt Agatha invited a hasty company to meet
him that same evening, trusting to her nieces
to help her in preparations.

For although you do not wish to meet him
there is no reason why he should not come to
my house, is there, Bethesda?' she asked.

None, I think. Aunt Agatha.' Was he not
as innocent as she who had made her home with
Mrs. Stanhope ?

Bethesda was very busy all the afternoon
arranging the fruits and flowers on the table
and in the parlours of her aunt's home. Marcott

brought basket after basket of blossoms from
the greenhouse, and she went from one room to
another with the baby on her arm  the little
May-flower had been ailing the last day or
two  leaving each a bower, hardly conscious of
how much beauty she was causing. Indeed, it
was not until the baby demanded undivided
attention, and she seated herself in a low rocker
to hush it to sleep, that she realised how she
had lavished the wealth of a garden in decorations
to honour the comines of a man she must
never see.

Just as this thought came over her Mrs. Stanhope
entered already dressed, and exclaimed at
the lovely effect of the rooms.

But you must go at once, dear. It is almost
time for them to be coming. Here, nurse, take
the baby, and call Miss Margaret.'

Bethesda had hurried away at the first word,
like a startled fawn, but stood in the western
porch a moment waiting for her sister. Her

white dress was caught up over one arm, and a
red silk shawl was thrown around her shoulders ;
her hair was low in her neck, and her eyes,
shadowed by weariness, were dark and brilliant.

Eene d'Isten coming up the pathway a little
early discovered Bethesda standing there, the
reflections of a warm sunset about her, alone.
The implacable distance which had so long
separated them seemed but a step to be trod
in triumph before he should hold her to his
heart.

Then Margaret joined her, and the two sped
across the lawn, Eene's thirsty eyes following
them. He dared not pursue ; it would be only
self-defeat.

He went up the steps and was immediately
ushered into the garden Bethesda had made.
He knew she had. He could feel the touches
of her light fingers on every leaf and stem.
There was her portrait, too, in the library. He
had last seen it when

The Marquis d'Isten, I believe V said a courteous
voice near him, and turning he saw his
hostess. ' I am Mrs. Stanhope. I am sorry
Mr. Stanhope is not here to welcome you. He
was detained, but will be doTi immediately.'

It is my fault, madame. My coming was
hastened too much, I perceive, by my great
desire to meet you. I was just renewing my
acquaintance with this beautiful portrait of
one who has often spoken to me of Madame
Stanhope. I trust Mademoiselle Hamilton is
well?'

Thanks, quite well. Be seated, pray. Have
you been long in America V

Several weeks, madame. It has cost me
much to be so long in a land where I flattered
myself I might find friends and not seek
them, but I was obliged to identify myself
with my position before I could take this great
pleasure. It grieves me deeply to learn that
I may now never meet one who honoured me

with her friendship, Madame Trescott, as I knew
her.'

Did I understand you to say you were my
sister's friend V inquired Mrs. Stanhope in a
tone Kene thought icy.

Indeed, madame, she never had one more
devoted ! Unhappily a misunderstanding arose,
which I the more profoundly regret, as I find
Miss Hamilton considers it her duty not to



allow me the pleasure of seeing her, to which I
had looked forward with eagerness. I assure
you, madame, that no misunderstandings can
ever eradicate from my heart sentiments of the
greatest esteem for both your sister and your
niece.'

He said this with much dignity, and an air
penetrated with regret, but Mrs. Stanhope was
not touched.

You are kind,' she replied gravely. ' If you
please, however, we' will not return to the past.
Our acquaintance dates from to-day. I am

pleased to be able to receive a gentleman so
highly commended by Secretary C .'

]mr. Stanhope bere joined them, and other
guests soon arrived. Eene d' 1st en put aside all
wounded pride and made himself as agreeable
as he knew how to be, which is saying much.
The impression he conveyed was most felicitous.
His appearance was said to be distinguished ;
his manner perfection ; his conversation brilliant
without being obtrusive. His praise of America
was both discriminating; and warm : his knowledge
of our institutions peculiarly accurate.
Every one was charmed with him, even Mr.
Stanhope, except the one he especially wished
to T\'in  ' Aunt Agatha.'

The difference between the masculine and
feminine was well marked here. The quite
easy conjecture Ealeigh Stanhope might have
made as to the cause of Bethesda's withdrawal
from the society of this man did not once occur
to him. To think of Bethesda in connection

VOL. III. p

with anything not crystal-clear and pure would
have seemed to any of her friends an unpardonable
insult. But Mrs. Stanhope, with her more
discerning eyes and intuitive perceptions, had
discovered, not alone in Bethesda's case, that
the fault from which we consider others most
exempt is probably the one they have fought
the hardest. Only through battle can come that
victory which is clothed in white raiment.

M. d'Isten also had been observing and planning
swiftly. As he took his leave he said to his
hostess :

May I have the honour of calling upon you
in the morning ? My time is somewhat limited,
or I would not intrude so soon after this delightful
evening.'

you have given it its success. I shall beat
home, and glad to see you any time tomorrow
after eleven.'

When Margaret went to her room that
evening, after a little chat with Aunt Agatha

to hear of ' this wonderful man,' she found
Bethesda sitting by the little Mary's crib patting
her to sleep. The child had been restless, and
Bethesda could always soothe her best. To Margaret
there was a very pathetic touch in the
simple picture then. The ways of Providence
seemed almost more inscrutable to her than when
she had seen Bethesda in the relentless clutches
of physical agony. There are many losses for
which death seems to compensate.

The next morning M. d' 1st en presented himself
promptly at Mrs. Stanhope's door. He had
told the coachman to drive slowly, and, well back
in the corner, had studied sith the keenest eyes
the adjacent house. On the porch was the little
dot of humanity which he knew to be Mabel's
child. Somebody was sitting in the shadow.
He bent forward eagerly, but only to see the
cap and apron of a nurse. Marcott was in the
garden gathering flowers. As the carriage passed
he glanced up carelessly at the windows of a

room on the second floor. Behind the half-drawn
curtains could be seen a figure with bent
head, the shapely head Eene knew so well. So,
she was writing. He dismissed his carriage at
the gate. He preferred to walk back. Some
opportunity might occur for  what ?

The flowers in the shadowy parlours were
drooping a little, but were still lovely, and down
on them all looked the jasmine face of Esda.
He had not liked the portrait in London ; here
he felt that he would give all he possessed in exchange
for it, unless  

Again Mrs. Stanhope interrupted his contemplation.
She greeted him with a fine reserve,
which was exceedingly characteristic of the
woman. Perhaps she felt it the more because
there was a gravity in his manner now which
ingratiated him in her favour.

With very little preamble he set before her
the object of his visit. It was not alone one of
courtesy, although he anticipated leaving soon,

as lie had told her ; nor was it solely a desire to
see again the sister of Madame Trescott and aunt
of Miss Hamilton, although he \as sure, he need
not say, this would have brought him far ; but
there was a very serious purpose in his mind to
which he ventured to hope she would listen with
kindness.

You come to me, then, on the understanding
that I am to receive you as the chaperone of my
niece Bethesda ?'

He glanced at her with sudden scrutiny as
she thus ignored her sister, but replied without
delay :

Precisely, madame. Miss Hamilton has
often told me you were just, a quality so rare
that one cannot over appreciate it. I appeal,
madame, to your justice.'

I am willing to listen,' said Mrs. Stanhope,
after a moment's pause.

May I then dare to ask you, madame '

You were to speak, not to question,' returned

Mrs. Stanhope, a smile hovering about her firm
lips.

I understand. Pray understand me also. I
cannot speak as I would unless some one has
spoken before me. Allow me to ask you, then,
if you know of the cause of the alienation between
Madame Trescott and myself?'

I have never been told.'

But you surmise. Bien. I shall be unable
to speak with the distinctness I would have
chosen ; but I trust you will comprehend.'

A silence ensued, during which Mrs. Stanhope
studied him keenly. He was at once dignified
and skilful ; he was a man of undeniably subtle
power. What would he say ?

Madame,' he resumed at last, ' this is a matter
which touches to the fibres of my honour and my
life. To Mr. Stanhope, who kindly gave me an
opportunity for explanation, I could not speak.
He had no suspicion of the truth. I need one who
has, and, moreover, a woman, who can understand.'

I am not sentimental remarked Mrs. Stanhope
drily.

I should have been blind to have supposed
it,' was the quick retort. ' Nor is it to sentimentality
that I wish to appeal ; no  only to
the justice which Miss Hamilton assured me I
should find in you.'

Proceed.'

When I first met your sister it was at a time
when my own life was wrecked. The details are
unnecessary, the fact is sufficient ; to me it was
terrible. I had enjoyed several weeks of delightful
companionship with your sister when a misunderstanding
arose, which was afterwards, in
Italy, explained to her satisfaction. I did not
see Miss Hamilton until Mrs. Trescott had restored
to me her approval, and asked me to come
to the house where they were staying on my
return from Eome. I was charmed to do so, and
there, very gradually, I became acquainted with
Miss Hamilton. Immediately before leaving

Florence I learned that Miss Hamilton wrote.
At this juncture I was guilty of building an air-castle.
I conceived the thought that I might
prevail upon Miss Hamilton to take the efforts of
my pen, which had never been of sufficient value
to encourage me to brave the terrors of the press,
and with her exquisite tact and feminine capacity
work them over into a shape which might be of
use to her and would be glory to me. In Paris
I proposed this scheme ; Miss Hamilton was
gracious enough to accept it ; Mrs. Trescott looked
upon it with vague alarm.'

It should not have been vague said Mrs.
Stanhope decisively.

You are right, madame. It was a dangerous
experiment. I did not see it as such until the end
came, and I was obliged to look back by the lurid
light of suffering on what I had innocently proposed.
That it was done innocently I do not know
how I can persuade you, unless you believe my
simple word. It maybe small to you ; to me it is all.'

There are times when thoughtlessness is a
crime.'

True, madame. It has been punished as such.'

He glanced appealingly. yet T\ith dignity, at
the face of his interlocutor. It was grave and
silent. He resumed with an introverted earnestness
:

The end came as I leave you to imagine. I
know you will do Miss Hamilton no injustice,
and I hope yon will not judge me with undue
severity. The ladies returned to America. The
conflict of customs, probably your wisdom, but
more than aU, I believe, her on inalienable
sense of right brought recognition of the errors
of the past. She benefited me as no one else
could have done, but she suffered cruelly for her
benevolence. Can you imagine what it was tome
to hear of her tortures, and know that I  /
had helped to inflict them upon her ? '

Where was your wife ? ' asked Mrs. Stanhope,
with chilling calm.

I wrote to her to come to me. Miss Hamilton
wrote her the same. She was unable to do
so at the time, and I went to her. I told her all
there was to tell. She preferred to still remain
with her mother. I returned to Paris. Through
a friend of Miss Hamilton's, to whom Mrs.
Trescott occasionally wrote, I heard of  of your
niece's hopeless condition. Weeks of excruciating
suspense followed. Just as they ended, by our
hearing that you had hope, news came of my
father's sudden prostration. I hastened to his
side and nursed him through a long illness.
When he died my mind could no longer bear the
strain so long put upon it. I was for weeks in a
condition of which I have no remembrance.
When I recovered '

Madame ! madame 1 ' cried Marcott, entering the
room without ceremony. ' The baby is in a convulsion.
Miss Margaret begs you will come at once.'

Excuse me,' said Mrs. Stanhope, already at
the door, and vanished.

Come to-niglit at ten without fail,' said M.
d' 1st en to Marmot. ' No excuses ; you did your
duty.'

Ao-ain ]\IabeL in the form of Iter child, had
interfered ! Had this interview, then, been all
in vain ? Should he never reach Bethesda ? he
asked himself, as he walked slowly past the house
where a sudden commotion prevailed. Bethesda
was there, there ! and he could not see her !

He sent in the afternoon to inquire of the
child's condition at Mrs. Stanhope's. It was
better, but still very ill. She would be unable
to see him for an indefinite period. But patience
is a good palfrey ; she had served his turn before
now ; he would ride her to the end.

He left the city that evening after new instructions
to Marmot. His determination was
only screwed tighter by these obstacles which impeded
his lines of conduct. By some means he
would win Bethesda's side, and thence he never
doubted but that he could touch her heart.

Do what your heart tells you ; yes, Aspasia, do all it tells
you. Remember how august it is : it contains the temple not
only of Love, but of Truth, and a whisper is heard from the
extremity of one to the extremity of the other. . . . May the
beautiful feet of Aspasia stand firm ! '  Landor.

Several weeks passed without Bethesda's hearing
anything more of Rene d'Isten ; but they
were not very calm ones to her. She was thankful
to have been busy ; that was always a gain.
On the little May Flower's recovery she had
taken to writing in order to clarify her mind.
In communion thus with her ideal could she
always best form practical resolutions.

She knew that this pause was only preparative
to an onslaught which would strive to be
irresistible, and she thought deeply, looking on
every side of the question which had anew come

to her to solve. It was not T\it]ioiit difficulty
that at last she put all away from her except her
own subjective knowledge, and tried to wait in
peace.

One morning in December there came a letter
from Guinevere containing the long-anticipated
announcement that she was to sail immediately
for New York, where she was to replace an
inefficient sinner under the same management
which had engaged her for the London season,
and that she looked forward eagerly to receiving
the one word of praise which would to her excel
all others.

It is so cruelly long since I have seen 3'ou,
dearest,' she wrote. ' My voice has improved, I
know that, but vriW you find hardness and mannerisms
in me ? Oh believe, dear, that there is
always the softest of nests in my heart for you,
where you lie amid the fair roses you resemble.
I know if you have changed it is only to become
more lovely and beloved, and I am afraid of

nothing except that you will be shocked by the
roughness this life has left upon me.

You will come to New York to visit me ?

You know I can't get out to S for an age

after I reach America, and I can wait to see
you. You will manage it ? '

This letter roused and enlivened Bethesda
remarkably. She had grown a little thin and
worn of late, but this good news seemed to quite
restore her spirits. Every one thought the
change would benefit her, and it was decided
that she should visit a friend in New York who
had long been pressing her to come, and who
would take good care of her.

I would not wish to be with Evra at a hotel,'
Bethesda said. ' She will be in a turmoil, and I
shall really visit with her better being somewhere
else. Besides, the Doctors would be rightfully
offended if I went anywhere rather than to them.'

The arrangements were soon made, and Bethesda
was to leave with her uncle next day.

I only wish you were going to be there,' said
Bethesda to her sister, T\ith a peculiar yearning.
I don't know how to be away from you anymore.'


It will be good for you both to discover,'
remarked Mrs. Stanhope. ' Margaret and the
baby shall come over to me while you are gone,
and you will come back all the fresher to one
another.'

We never needed that, did wee, Beth ? '

No, dear ; I have no fear of our tiring one
another.'

Mr. Stanhope's companionship on the journey
east was a great relief to his niece, for she shrank
with unusual timidity from being alone with the
knowledge that Eene was in America, and probably
aware of all her movements. It was really
something of a comfort, too, to leave Marcott
behind. His presence had become irksome to
her, yet she disliked to dismiss him, for he was
irreproachable in service and discretion ; but she

felt she could be less guarded when he was fairly-left
behind. Perhaps later it would be advisable,
not alone on her own account, to send him away
altogether.

Guinevere had particularly requested Bethesda
not to come down to the dock to meet her.
Come instead to the hotel when you know I
have arrived, and once more I shall hold you in
my arms and press you to the heart whose love
you have known and touched.'

Bethesda did as she was bidden, had a telegram
sent her when the steamer came, and at
last started off one snowy afternoon, dressed with
especial daintiness, to meet the friend she had
not seen since that summer day in London so
long ago.

She had sent flowers before her to give the
artist a silent welcome, and when she entered the
parlour reserved to Mademoiselle Cinoni's use
the room was full of fragrance, if empty. In an
instant, however, the door was flung open with

an impetuosity which brought a smile to Bethesda's
lips, and Guinevere, tall, golden-haired,
insistent as ever, stood before her, and held her
hands, and searched her face, and then took her,
furs and all, into a passionate embrace.

You are my Lily just as you were ! ' she
exclaimed. ' Only I had not dreamed you could
change so, and still be my own. And I,  would
you know me ? '

She held Bethesda off, and seized her eyes
with a look which was penetrating yet trustful.

No one could ever mistake you,' said Bethesda
with admiring warmth. ' Dear E\T:a ! it is
so natural to see you  and yet so strange.'

Ah, yes ; you are thinking of your aunt.
True, child. We have gone through much since
we were last together, I as well as you. But we
can never lose the grasp of one another's hearts
which we took, and held, and will hold for ever.
Come, love ; let us sit down and give me time to
feel I actually have you. No, you shan't undo

VOL. III. Q

your cloak; let me. Didn't I use to be your
maid ? I haven't forgotten my old ways. Do
you remember the bon-bons and the lilies ? Ah,
sweet! it was good of you to send me these.
Here are some roses, too, such as you used to like.
Not from you ? '

She took up the card lying among them, then
glanced sharply at Bethesda. Seeing her unsuspecting
face she threw the card immediately
aside.

Well, then, I don't care for them. Here,
take this chair by the fire. Now, don't rebel.
You know I am well aware of your habit of saying
" No " and " No," and I just don't mind it at
all ! Here you sit, dear, and here I sit,' pulling
forward a stool and placing herself quickly at
Bethesda's feet. ' Ah, now I am happy ! I will
just hold your hand, caressing mia, and we will
be still. I must realise you.'

Bethesda submitted quietly. How familiar it
all was, and how fresh and frank this artist's

heart had kept during these years of gaslight
glare ! One could see the experience in her face,
however ; in the faint lines on her forehead, the
proud glance of the eyes, the widened nostrils,
the decision and haughty indifference of the
mouth. The artist was there also stronger than
ever ; the intensity, the assured capacity, the
power of enthusiasm, were heightened and
steadied. Bethesda looked forward to seeing
her in some great part with an anticipative
thrill.

'AVell?' said Miss Conover, breaking the
silence with a full glance upwards, and a closer
pressure of the hand. But without waiting for
Bethesda to reply, she went on : ' I must tell
you, dearest, how free and true I feel just here,
humbly at your feet. I believe the touch of
this little hand has lifted from me the weight of
a hundred prisoners' chains. You don't know
what my life has been, Beth; such suspicion, and
distrust, and rancour ; and all the time, night

and day, having to defend myself, and guard my
thoughts not to become bitter and hating too.
And now, here I come to you, Feel you, and all
the best I have lived, all the glories of my art,
and the noble ideals it lends me for a time, filter
through into myself, my me. You do this, love.
Each lineament of your face shows how you and
your ideal are one, and helps me to feel mine so
too. Some one said that, " in his hand her
soul felt safe and free." Mine does in yours,
Bethesda.'

Dear Evra I ' said Bethesda in a deeply
touched tone, ' it is because you are so true an
artist that you feel this. Don't rob yourself to
lavish praise on me.'

I don't ! Haven't I tried to be just this and
failed? I have fought for it, cried for it, prayed
for it, and  lost it. Now, with one little touch,
in an instant you give it me.'

Her head fell into Bethesda's lap, and the
hand she loved wandered caressingly and in

silence over the soft curls. It spoke too much,
however, for Guinevere rose abruptly.

I can't stand it !' she said in a choked voice,
and went softly out of the room.

A moment later Mrs. Conover entered, and
greeted Bethesda cordially, although she looked
anxious.

What have you been doing to my daughter ? '
she asked, half smiling. ' I have not seen her
so overcome in a long time.'

She is tired from the voyage, and the excitement
of meeting again has, I think, surprised
her into a momentary weakness. She is well ?
She looks so.'

Oh, very well. She begins rehearsals tomorrow.
They are in a great hurry for her to
appear. They won't give her much time. It is
a disadvantageous arrangement, but she would
listen to nothing: in her eagerness to come to
America. You will be at her debut? She is
not frightened any more as she used to be, 

unless you frighten her, my dear. And how is
your sister? And poor Mrs. Trescott's baby?
We have taken such an interest in everything.
Are you quite well yourself now ? I believe, my
child, the baby has made a little mother of you.
You seem like a married woman.'

Do I V said Bethesda, with a rather sad smile.
Our May-Flower certainly exerts a great influence
over us, almost as much as her mother used to,
in a different way. I wish you could see her.
She does not look at all like Aunt Mabel unfortunately,
but she is very winning.'

Oh, I can fancy that, Mrs. Trescott was so
charming. But you should just see Vera with a
child. A friend of hers had one, and she
worshipped it. She used to slip away from the
parlour in the evening and go upstairs to sing it
to sleep. Sometimes the whole household would
crowd around the door to listen ; but she never
knew it. I kept that little domestic pleasure for
her undisturbed. You can fancy how she has

improved, but you shall hear ! How very good
it was of you to strew such sweet praise in her

path before she came ! Your name now

Ah, here she comes.'

Guinevere had conquered her emotion, and
was during the rest of the interview quite her
usual brisk, entertaining, and brilliant self. She
had a thousand stories to tell, and told them with
admirable spirit. But she would not let Bethesda
talk much. Something in the low tones threatened
her newly won composure.

As Bethesda was going away she took her in
her arms and whispered :

When you see me again you won't affect me
so. Come often, dear ; I need you. If I am
out I will leave word for you, and I will run into
you whenever I can catch a minute. Wrap
yourself well, sweet. Good-bye.'

She said good-bye, but she held her Lily
still locked in a close embrace.

What are you ? ' she broke out at last.

Are you here in my arms or not ? I believe I
shall find you died a week ago, and this is your
spirit come to visit me. "Well, go, if you must.
But don't vanish entirely. I shall see if you
exist tomorrow. You laugh ? It is no laughing
matter. Still, I have your card, and we
shall see.'

Guinevere found her friend in existence the
next day, and for many days after, and gradually
she became used to her, and lost the feeling of
insubstantiality which had at first haunted her.
However, she did not feel satisfied in regard to
her, and groped in the dark, as it were, for the
keynote to this elusive harmony.

The name of Eene d'Isten was for long not
mentioned between them. Bethesda had become
so unfamiliar to the sound of it that it would
have startled her, in spite of the fact that now
he was seldom absent from her thoughts. Being
away from Margaret and the baby, and all the
surroundings of her new life, and again with

comparative strangers and Evra, as lie had been
in the old days, brought the past continually
before her. Even Mrs. Trescott seemed less
absent than when her child was present, and
except when Bethesda was with the Conovers
her life seemed to move among shadows ; a feeling*
that made her look to the honos future at
times with a half-unconscious dread.

The night that Mademoiselle Cinoni made her
debut, Bethesda felt herself transported bodily to
the Pergola in Florence, and, when a voice addressed
her, turned almost expecting to see
Signor Straora. Yet everything around her was
different. The house was an American one, and
if crammed was capriciously critical and timid of
applause. As the 023era went forward, however,
Bethesda forgot herself and her surroundings
completely. One in the audience felt it safe for
him to keep his glass fixed upon her face, recognising
each shade of emotion, yet unafraid of
detection.

Mademoiselle Cinoni was at her best, which
was superb. The tenor supported her admirably,
and the matchless beauty of the opera was rendered
with perfection. The house from being
cold and hesitating, became quite Italian with
enthusiasm. An opera so sung had never before
been heard in America, and neither had the
applause to which it gave rise. Bethesda was
in one of the stage-boxes, and was recognised by
some as the authoress whose name had endorsed
the singer before them. The fact passed from
one to another between the acts, and when she
let fall a mass of lilies at her friend's feet, which
was immediately caught up with a glance of
gratitude, a wave of tribute broke over the
house, which was an acknowledgment of both
the season's favourites.

In talking the evening over next day, Guinevere
said, somewhat abruptly :

Monsieur d'Isten was there. Did you know
he was a marquis now ? '

I had heard of it. When did he lose his
father ? ' asked Bethesda calmly.

' Only a short time ago ; about three months
now. He was very ill himself after it. The
strain had been a lonsr one, for it was soon after
your sister telegraphed us you were better that he
heard the news of his father. Ah ! those were
terrible days, dearest ! M. d' 1st en was quite
beside himself when we heard there was no hope
for you. He entertained for you a devotion so
pure and unselfish that I think at any time he
would have given his life to spare you pain.'

Bethesda turned somewhat paler, but she
answered steadily :

'Do you think so? Then, Evra, why is he
here now ? '

Let him tell you, dear : that is all he desires.
Yes, I have seen him ; of course I have. We
came quite close together, through you, those
dreadful weeks in Paris. He Tote to me after
you refused to see him in S . He did not

see why you should not trust him. I was glad
to be able to tell him I was about to sail for
America. I was sure you would let me prevail
upon you to meet him, and allow him to explain
what he has to tell you. Don't fear him. He
is an honourable man. May I tell him he can
call on you ? or will you meet him here ? '

Neither, Guinevere. How can you ask it of
me ? It is not right that I should meet him 
not under existing circumstances.'

What are " existing circumstances " ? '

The present ones.'

Ah ! dear, don't put me off. Be frank with me.
I assure you, I,  and you trust me ?  that there is
no reason why you should not meet  unless '

Well ? '

Unless you are engaged.'

Bethesda turned aside abruptly and did not
speak.

I did not mean to hurt you, darling ; believe
me, I am only working for your happiness ; I '

Evra, where is Madame cVIsteu { '

Madame d'Isten ? I have no idea.'

Enough, Evra ; this is a matter no one but I
can understand  no one but I should control
You must trust me when I say firmly, and for
the last time, that I shall not illinois meet
Rene d'Isten.'

Ah ! if you are so determined But let

me just say this : Have you no thought of what
he may understand better than you ?  no belief
that he should control anything ? Bethesda,
this is not as it should be ; you are not frank
with me or with your own heart.'

Miss Hamilton raised her eyes slowly to her
friend's and let them rest there. A majesty of
resignation dominated all desire in them so royally
that the artist seized her hands with a cry :

Do as you think best, my darling, but don't
look at me like that ! You stab me ! '

And Bethesda pressed the contrite hands, and
nothing more was said.

Where I found only food

For self-indulgence, you still blew a spark at brood

I' the dullest amber ; stopped not till self-sacrifice imbued

Heaven's face with flame.'

Egbert Browning.

A FEW days later Mademoiselle Cinoni was singing
at a matinee, from which Bethesda had been
detained by company. She escaped, however,
late in the afternoon, and went to the hotel to
see Guinevere as soon as she should return. The
gas was already lighted in the streets as she left
her carriage, and twilight made the parlour dim
and chill.

Put on more coal, please,' she said to the
servant, who by this time knew her well. ' Miss
Conover will be cold when she comes in. I will
wait for her.'

Shall I light the gas, madam V
Xo, thanks ; the firelight pleases me.'
When he had left the room she laid aside her
hat and cloak, bent to see if the jacqueminot
roses at her belt were crushed, and then went
towards the grate slowly, pressing her hands together
as if she were in pain. Her face, distinct
in the half glow, half gloom, was sad. The
curves of her lips denoted a renunciation that
was made not without sorrow, and her eyes shone
with unshed tears.

She stood a few moments on the hearth in her
gray close-clinging dress, her mien one of lassitude
and depression. Then she moved, with a
faintly indicated gesture of shifting a burden,
and slowly seated herself.

The next instant the hand she had allowed to
drop over the arm of her chair was seized and
held and kissed again and ao;ain. Some one
knelt beside her with bowed head, murmuring,
in broken syllables :

Esda ! My beloved Esda ! My Bethesda ! '

The passive fingers grew icy under his lips
before he dared look up. The chill silence shocked
him. What had happened ?

Her face was ashen ; her eyes closed. He
sprang to his feet in alarm.

Leave me ! ' she said then faintly.

He went away at once ; not out of the room,
but to the window at the end of it, and stood
there indecisive.

What should he do ? If he left her now, his
last chance was gone, and if he stayed he might
kill her before she learned what he meant. But he
could not give her up ! He must discover what
this meant, this coldness 'and suffering  the one
so apparent, the other intentionally concealed.

Gradually he turned so as to be able to see
her without seeming to do so. She was recovering
; she was sitting upright now, her hand to
her heart. Suspense was worse than death to
them both. He went swiftly to her side.

Bethesda.' lie said, ' I have no wife. Be
mine.'

He waited for some response, but she gave
him none. She was gathering the strength
she knew she must command, in long stifled
breaths.

At last he went and knelt before her, where
the full light from the fire could strike his face.

Esda,' he pleaded, ' I beseech you to look at
me. Bead in my face what you can. I have
nothing to fear, and once it was an open book to
you as was my soul.'

'Hush!'

I cannot longer be silent ! ' he exclaimed passionately.
' I have waited and waited for you to
trust me. I must exculpate myself I beg your
forgiveness for having forced my way into your
presence. If your heart does not intercede forme
after these years of thirst I will not attempt
it. I have not time. Listen, Bethesda ; look at
me and tell me, are you afraid of my deceiving

VOL. III. R

you  you who are omnipresent, omnipotent with
me ? I have obeyed you with unwavering persistence
for two whole years. I have done with
joy all you told me, because it was your wish.
And, Bethesda, I have had during the darkest
times a sure faith that Heaven would reward us.
God gives it to you, Esda, to be my heaven on
earth ; you cannot refuse ! Why would you not
see me ? You knew I would not have come to
you until I was free, and could claim you before
all the world as my own. You are mine ; you
cannot deny it. You are killing yourself in trying
to deny it. Beloved, take what God offers
you and share it with me. Let us enjoy life
purely. God offers it to us, Bethesda ; we must
not refuse.'

In spite of his ardent words he had not dared
move towards her. Something held him away.
He felt her far off, as if the remorseless ocean
rolled its waves between them still.

Eene, you have spoken, let me speak.' Her

voice, faint at first, grew clearer as she proceeded.
Once you overcame all my scruples, one by one.
I have been taught my weakness and your power,
and I have not come to this moment unprepared.
You must understand that I am firm when I say
I can never marry you.'

Bethesda ! '

Hush, you must hear me now. Think how
we tempted one another away from our allegiance
to right, to duty, and you will see '

You never " tempted" me,' burst out Eene
irrepressibly, ' unless it were to purity and fidelity.
You put your hand on me and said : Be faithful
to Louise, and I obeyed you. But now all my
allegiance to her is severed. I never was hers,
and I now, heart and soul, am yours. It is to
you alone I owe fealty.'

You owe no fealty to me, my friend,  that
is another error into which we fell. It is not to
persons so much that we owe duties as to ourselves
and to God. Your conscience is too precious

a charge to give to any one but him. That
was where I injured you before.'

As if you ever injured me ! I would leave it
with the good God to-day to declare if I am nota
better man than when I met you ; ay, Bethesda,
a better man.' And Bethesda, recognising the
stronger manhood in him, could not disbelieve it.
When I look towards God, beloved, I cannot
help seeing you, because you are above me, and
nearer him. Do not shrink, Bethesda, for I speak
reverently. I found the tenderness and pity of
God during your illness when he answered my
prayers and made you well. The weight of my
conscience shall never rest again upon you, I
promise you ; but my conscience, yes, God himself,
who is love, tells me to claim you, to make
you mine. I am free. I am free, Bethesda ; you
cannot put me back in those chains which weighed
on my soul and your tender heart. Beloved, you
cannot refuse me. I hold your heart, come tome
and let us be at rest.'

He held out his arms towards her with an
eloquent appeal, but she shrank into her chair,
and clenched her hands tight.

Ma bien aimed ! ' exclaimed Eene, a newly
aroused anxiety in his voice : ' Thou dost love
me ? Thou wilt not be obdurate ? Thou wilt
not condemn one who loves each breath thou
dearest, to exile from thee ? See, Esda ; my
father is no more ; nothing longer binds me to
Europe. I will come to America, and live where
thou desires. Anything, so that we are together.
Thou must, love. Thy fragile life cannot
bear this strain. Thy petals, my rose, are
closing over the grief which consumes thee. Let
me snatch it from thee, dearest, and fill thy
heart with rejoicing. I can, for thou lowest me.'

Bethesda could not speak, but made a negative
sign.

Thou dost not love me ? ' exclaimed Eene,
seizing her hand. ' Thou canst not say it ! Each
touch of these slender fingers betrays thee !

Thou dost love me I thou wilt always love me.
I hold thy heart ; I shall never let it go, so help
me God.' Then his voice suddenly fell to low,
persuasive accents : ' Give me this hand, Bethesda.
It is small ; it is kind. Since I have the
wealth of thy heart, add this little, dear hand.
It will lose thee nothing; it will give me all.
Silent still ? Ah, God ! was ever grief like this I
To see her dying, and feel my very vitals gnawed
with hunger to save her, and she refuses me !
Esda, Bethesda, it shall not be ! Thou canst not
do this thing, for I will not let thee. If thou
didst not love me I would not complain, but

now Feel my heart ! its throbs are each a

tribute to you. You have my life in your hands.
Do not spill the warm blood that would pour
itself into your veins to nourish you. I cannot
live longer without thee, Bethesda ! I will
follow thee about the world ; I will renounce
all else to wait upon thee, thy shadow not closer
nor more persistent. And to my importunity

thou silt 3rLeld what thou wilt not to m j love !
Bethesda, ma toute aimed, look upon thy servant
and kill him not ! '

He flung himself at her knees, and buried his
face in his hands. A new strength, not her own,
seemed to enter into Bethesda's anguished heart.

Eene, look at me,' she said. He lifted grief-stricken
eyes to hers. ' Tell me ; if  if I married
you and should die, would you not feel your life
sacred to me ? '

In death as in life,' said Rene solemnly.

Then it is your duty to feel the same, to act
at least the same, to Louise. Love only makes
duty passionately present, and as long as your
body is one vdXh. your soul, you and your wife
are one flesh.'

Eene rose in bewilderment.

You do not mean that simply because I have
been married you would not marry me, even if
Louise were dead ? No, no, Bethesda, that would
be folly.'

" Even if she were'" quoted Bethesda wonderingly.
' Does she still live ? Did you not say
she died last spring ? '

She was looking at him piercingly now, and
under her eyes his fell.

I lost her then, yes,' said Kene, feeling an
irresistible sense of equivocation before this clear
soul.

But she had been shocked into an acute consciousness
of  was it concealment or duplicity ?
in him. It wrung her heart, but it severed
her from him, and made her keen after the
truth. She rose, struck a match, and lit the
drop-light, then turned to him with a grave
authority.

Tell me about it,' she said simply. ' How
did she die ? What caused her death ? '

Rene looked at her and down again, aground
for a moment, but he made his decision, and
floated free quickly.

It is a sad story, my Bethesda,' he said, with

a creature of merciful withholding. ' Do not let
us speak of it now. Let it suffice that I assure
you solemnly I am free,  free absolutely, by law,
by heart, and by intent.'

But I must know,' said Bethesda, looking at
him with clear commanding eyes. ' You used
to say you spoke freely to me ; do so now, this
once more, Eene, for I ought to know.'

Eene felt her supremacy, and his habit of
giving obedience where he gave confidence
reasserted itself in an unlooked-for manner. But
if she knew the truth, his cause would be lost.
No, why should it ? On the contrary it might
vanquish that uncomprehended notion of hers to
find that he had never been married. And was
not love the true marriage ? He had often heard
her say so.

Listen then, since you insist,' he began. ' T
desire nothing so much as to lay my whole life
in your hands. I would have spared you what
cannot help but pain your large heart, for it

means suffering to another, but as always I obey
you. Louise was never my wife.'

Never your wife !' repeated Bethesda in low
tones of dismay.

No ; the marriage was illegal. We neither
of us suspected it for years, but her lover proved
it to me not long ago. She never was other
than Louise Manners.' And then he told her
of the law forbidding the intermarriage of French
and foreigners on foreign soil. ' But we could
arrange that. You could go with your aunt to
France, and there '

 Hush ! How can you speak of marriage tome,
to any one but Louise ! ' She sat erect in
her chair, as though it were the throne of judgment.
' Your whole honour binds you to her.
She is your wife before G-od ; man's laws are
insignificant beside those divine ones. You cannot
help but marry her.'

But, chere Bethesda, listen. Is not love
a divine law ? Louise never loved me, nor I

her. She married me, as we thought, loving
another. She did wrong ; I know you think so.
Would you, then, have me commit the same
sin?'

I would not have you commit the sin of
deserting a woman who had entrusted her
honour, her life, to your hands, no matter what
her feelings. To act you must judge by acts.
You are her husband. You should not have let
a day pass before you acknowledged her lawfully
as such. She knows nothing of it, you say ?
But think how cruel would be her fate did chance
let her know. Oh, hasten back and marry herat
once ! Do not linger an unnecessary hour.'

If she refused me, and preferred to marry
one whom she has long loved, what then,
Bethesda ?' he said, with slow significance. ' And
she has often wished to be free from me ; we
both know that.'

Bethesda flinched a moment before this possibility,
but recovered herself at once.

Then show her how wrong it would be she
answered promptly. ' Plead with her ; point
out to her how no man could respect her did she
choose, wilfully choose, to stigmatise her past
with dishonour ; less than any other, a person
who has acted as that man has. How evil must
have been his aim to have proven this technicality
to you ! No, no, she would not so malign
herself as to choose him rather than you ; she
could not ; by my woman's heart I know it 1 '

Ah, that heart, Bethesda ! it is mine. I will
not give it up.'

It is not yours, Eene d'Isten,' and Bethesda
drew herself up superbly. '' My heart is no
man's who could leave any deed undone to repair
an irreparable loss, not only to the woman he
has called wife but to himself. Oh, it is the
cruellest of my punishments that I should be the
object to stand between you and the performance
of your most manifest duty ! Bene, my respect
even cannot be yours unless you return instantly

to France and many Louise. I conch never forgive
myself, never forgive you, if our acquaintance
should thus degrade you.'

That is morbidness, folly \ ' exclaimed Eene,
almost angrily. ' Your morality is warped,
Bethesda, by thinking on this subject so near
your heart. Is not love the real marriage ? And
I never loved Louise, nor she me. Two years
ago when you bade me renounce you, you were
a saint. It was the crucifixion of your heart
and of mine, but you did right. Even in the
bitterest moments I acknowledged this. Now I
say you are wrong. You sacrifice your happiness
and mine ; your health, my sanity perhaps,
to a fanciful duty, a morbid sense of honour. I
have given eight years of my life to Louise
without succeeding; in winnings her love. Let
that suffice. I will do what is right by her,
but '

'But nothing else than marriage can even
mitigate this terrible evil, Eene. ''A fanciful

duty " ? No duty could be more imperative.
What 1 You would be " unlike other men " and
yet live eight years before the world as a husband,
and then refuse to marry the woman you called
wife ? You would be the truly chivalrous man,
and leave a woman to ignominy who had borne
your name ? You cannot do it, Eene ; it is not
in you. You will marry her because it is right,
because you owe it to God to redeem an innocent
mistake, or else it becomes a most guilty one.
If it is a sacrifice, look upon it as a proof of repentance
for the wrong we have done. It will
be accepted as such, and only such a one can be
accepted, for it alone can undo the wrong. Trust
me, Eene.'

He was silent a few moments, overcome against
his will by her words and tone.

Beloved, how can I trust you,' he said at
last, ' when I feel that this is overleaping the
limits of morality, and that in an endeavour
which robs me of you, it is killing you. Ah !

dearest, trust me once. Love is the sovereign
who dictates laws, who seizes our hearts and
gives us no liberty but in obeying his commands.
Come to me, fear not. It is what men have done
always ; it is what every law sanctions. Besides,
dearest, it is your life ; it is my life. Come.'

She had grown paler and paler as he spoke,
and her hand was pressed to her side. Eene
thought he felt a wavering; in her mind, and tried
to take her hand, kneeling beside her. But she
motioned him away.

' No,' she said faintly, * this  this hurts deep.
It stabs me, Eene, to have such words addressed
to me by one who, before God and my soul,
owes himself to another. This proves how unlike
we are. We are no longer one in thought
and feeling ; we are grievously separated, more
than ever before. Go, Eene. I don't wish to see
you any more.'

'But you love me, Bethesda,' said Eene, with
deep reproach.

I did love you ; you knew that ; it was
wrong. Because it was wrong I have striven to
overcome it. I need strive no longer, for you
have killed it now. You need not snatch my
hand ; I am not a girl to be swept off my feet,
and  and  that I should live to say it !  your
touch makes me shudder.'

Eene dropped her hand, and stepped back as
if struck. The recoil of his own act hurt him
too, and deeply.

Presently Bethesda raised her head and the
faint colour came back to her lips and cheeks.

 But I cannot believe it,' she said. ' It is
only because you do not see it right. Look at it
in this way, Eene. If I were to marry you here,
and you discovered that the marriage was illegal,
what would you do then ? '

Take you at once to France and marry you
there.'

Then how can you doubt that this is your
duty to Louise \ What you would do for me

because yon care for me, do for her because it is
right. If it is hard, do it the more gladly because
it shows you grieve for past faults. Show
that you are stronger for temptations resisted, by
doings this deed.'

o

'It would never have occurred to me two
years ago as a duty, Bethesda, and now  I confess
I was in. doubt, just at first.'

Ah, you see ! I knew there must be something
there if I could only reach it. You mil goto
her ? You will persuade her ? You do not
yourself think there could be any danger of her
choosing any one but you ? She feels differently
towards you than she did ?  I knew it. I am
convinced you will both yet be hajopy. Go to
her ; show her the position, for she must see to
understand. Make her acknowledge that she
prefers you, and oh, Eene, would I not be glad ! '

Her face was radiant now, and her eyes starry.
Eene looked at the transformation in amazement.


VOL. III. S

And would you have nothing to regret '? ' he
said slowly.

Regret ? I '? No, indeed ! A moment ago
I thought I had lost you really, vitally ; that
you were ignoble. I see now you were but trying
me. But if you can accomplish an harmonious
union between yourself and your wife you
will give me the keenest happiness. I feel a
great weight lifted from me, for I believe it is
possible, and that you will not fail. I am sure
you will not. A steamer sails tomorrow, some
friends of mine go by it ; go too, and telegraph
me when she has acknowledged her affection for
you and you are really married. That shall bethe
last word between us, and what a good word !
-You will ?

There was a little silence, while Bethesda's
eyes seemed to seize his very soul and hold it to
her high purpose. Then :

I never disobeyed you yet, he said. ' I shall
not now. I will do my best.'

Ah ! my true Bethesda 1 ' lie exclaimed presently,
recognising that lie had won his o\vti
highest approval in winning hers. ' Each time I
approach you I see a new height of truth. You
have cured me of one evil after another ever
since the pool of your heart was first stirred
for me.'

No, it is only Christ who can do that she
answered softly. ' He bids you drop the burden
of the past and go forward in a new life, free.
He Twill bless you in it, Eene ; go.'

Through love to light ! Oh wonderful the way,
That leads from darkness to the perfect day !
From darkness and from dolor of the night,
To morning that comes singing o'er the sea.
Through love to light ! through light, God, to Thee
Who art the love of love, the eternal light of light I '

E. W. Gilder.

Several years later Eene d'Isten, with Louise
upon his arm, was going through the Parisian
Salon on the Artist's Day before the grand opening.
He was glancing at the pictures a little
carelessly, more occupied with the memories of
seven years ago when he had come here with
Bethesda and Mrs. Trescott, than with what surrounded
him, although he did not fail in delicate
attentions to his wife.

His face showed the time and experience that

lead passed, yet with all its recueillement it was
not sad. There was a compact force of character,
a unity of purpose, a continual surety of uprightness,
which gave new dignity to his features, and
made each line a mark of honour. If his life was
much in the past, the present was unusually full
of large aims and noble endeavour, and the toying
dth life which had once been a delight to him had
now given place to earnest work. At the present
moment, however, he was for a rarity dreaming.
Louise had changed much more markedly than
Eene. There was a content and self-control in
her face ncA-er seen there previously, and her
eyes were often turned with solicitous tenderness
to her husband's face. She frequently thought
in recurring to that stormy scene five years ago,
when she had heard of his devotion, her lover's
perfidy, and the American's nobility, that some
good power had guided her to choose that better
part which should not be taken from her. Her
husband was ever near to uphold and guide

her, and she was quite willing that he should
dream occasionally, for it proved his freedom in
her presence. She knew that she was never irksome
to him now.

The people round them meantime were neither
dreaming nor pondering. They were all extremely
interested in the exhibition. Picturesque
men with eccentric manners, and 'artist' written
on each article of their dress ; women with more
brains  of a kind  and less timidity than ordinary
womanhood possesses ; scattered members
of the haute-vole amusing themselves with the
scene ; all thronged through the rooms together,
examining, criticising, and babbling. Every one
seemed to tend with a rather remarkable unanimity
to the central apartment where the prize
picture hung. The listens drifted with the
rest, hearing indifferently the remarks of this or
that one near them.

It is by an Italian,' said one.

" The Answer to the Sphinx ! " ' laughed

another, turning; the leaves of a catalogue. ' What
a name ! '

More of a mystery than the question sneered
a third.

' Oh, mon Dieu, these Italians 1 ' cried a brill
woman. ''WTiat ideas they do
have, there in the land of the Beatrice ! I demand
it of you, messieurs, did such a woman as
this ' Answer" ever live V

Ma foi ! not in Paris.'

 Does she look Italian, then ? ' asked the
woman triumphantly. * Gold-brown hair, and eyes

of Well, you shall tell me what shade

they are. The prize, indeed ! The man does
not know how to mix his colours. '

Here they reached the threshold of the centre
room, and suddenly all the chatter fell away from
Eene d'Isten's hearing as if he had been lifted to
another region by one sweep of a powerful wing.
Before him was the almost breathing form of
Bethesda Hamilton.

She stood, dressed in the warm white she
loved, her head turned a little upwards, as if she
had but just let her eyes fall from some great
vision, to meet, and hold, and exalt, the sight of
those who looked upon her.

When one could leave the eyes for a moment,
one noticed the brows, serene in spite of their
capacity for suffering ; the exquisite contour from
forehead to chin, and the willing resignation of
the mouth,, which made it really joyous.

It was a face beyond compare, and it was a
faultless painting. Louise had seen photographs
of Bethesda, and she recognised the face, and
admitted its supremacy. She tightened her clasp
a little, unconsciously, on her husband's arm, as
they stood beneath the gaze which met and held
them both above all earthly strife. This was the
woman he had left to come to her and retrieve
her from dishonour. A deep humility overspread
her face. - She looked up at Eene. He was
wrapped in an exalted enthusiasm. The painting;

made alive to him Bethesda's books which
came year after year and laid their treasures wide
before him. It reinvigorated his noblest aims
and truest endeavours. He turned to his wife
and pressed her hand against his side.

She needs no mortals,' he said. ' Long since
I called her a saint. She is that. No one can
touch her. She is above us all, and she smiles
down on our union, my Louise. Thus did she
look when she told me her keenest happiness
would be in seeing us truly united. She sees us
now.'

Louise's eyes were Stemming in tears at the
tenderness of his tone. All the bitterness of
jealousy was replaced by this sweetness. She
clung; to him a moment with both hands.

A laugh, a Parisian laugh, low and keen,
startled them.

Why do they paint impossibilities ? ' queried
a languid voice. * I find cano-els much too unreal
for me. Some lover's vision \ Of course ! How

silly they are ! ' and another laugh rounded the
mocking sentence to completeness.

It turned all Eene d' 1st en's thoughts into a
new channel. For a moment he was madly
jealous of the man who had access to Bethesda
sufficiently to paint this. A man who loved her
too, that was clear. Only a lover could see her
like this, and reproduce her  for the Parisian
world to scoff at ! Faugh ! that was no love !
The fellow had no sense of decency even 1

Yet, as he looked up again, she seemed so
unapproachable, though speaking to each one,
and taintless as Goethe's angels throwing the
flowers of love into hell, that he could not feel
her sullied ; not as he would have done had that
other jasmine-faced picture hung here, questioning
and wistful.

Now all her questions were answered. She
knew,

A half-hour later Eene d'Isten turned and
asked some one beside him who was the artist.

Monsieur Straora, an Italian was the reply.

Can you tell me where I might find him ? '

He stands there, monsieur.'

The marquis looked and saw the Florentine
painter absorbed in contemplation of his work.

Let us speak to him, Louise, if you do not
object ? ' he said.

Certainly not.'

A few steps brought Eene and his wife to
Signor Straora's side.

Monsieur Straora, I believe ? Pray allow
me to give you my card and claim acquaintance
through one I have often heard mention you,
and whom you have now placed before us so beautifully.
Madame d'Isten, Monsieur Straora.'

The artist bowed, and answered courteously :

I am much pleased to meet you, Monsieur le
Marquis. When I last had the pleasure of seeing
Miss Hamilton, she had recently received a letter,
I think, from Madame d'Isten. It seemed to
give her great satisfaction.'

'Not sufficient for her to answer it,' said
Louise, smiling. ' But I trust she is well ? '

Quite well, for her ; at least she was a month
ago. She is delicate, but you see her works ? You
know then how indefatigably busy she must be.'

And is she really so beautiful as you depict
her, monsieur ? '

The artist smiled as he glanced at his work,
but sobered in so doing,

I wish you might meet her, madame, to see
how little I have done her justice.'

I wish I might, indeed : but since she does
not even respond to my letters, will you not call
upon us and tell us about her ? I confess I have
great curiosity in regard to a woman who is so
exquisite, and yet occupies herself only with
work, and the care of another's child  which washer
life when we last heard of her, was it not,
Monsieur d' 1st en V

' ' Her whole interest, I believe,' said Eene ;
but that would not be apt to last.'

I see no signs of its clinging replied Signor
Straora quietly. ' She is more than content ;
she is happy. One could not wish her life to
change and an involuntary sigh escaped him.

Is the destiny of your painting fixed ? ' asked
Eene presently.

Yes ; it is not for sale. I shall have it taken
to Italy when the Exhibition is over. I see you
have both gone to the heart of my subject. Few
in Paris dll, but it shall hang; here for a while
to teach the city what a woman may be.'

The three stood silent for some time, while
the eyes above took possession of their souls and
led them into the regions of peace. Eene had
recognised that the artist's admiration of his
subject, though exalted, was impersonal, and he
guessed the cause. Bethesda, as he had said,
needed no mortals. And Louise could have no
jealousy, for she felt herself closer to her husband
now than this woman could be.

But some deep and uncomprehended feeling

brought the tears to her eyes. Eene saw
them.

My wife he bent to say, ' she gave you tome
gladly, and I thank her.'

As Monsieur and Madame d'Isten turned
away after securing the promise of a speedy
call from Signor Straora, they heard their new
friend mutter to himself, still studying the picture
:

And yet it is not like, it is not like.'
