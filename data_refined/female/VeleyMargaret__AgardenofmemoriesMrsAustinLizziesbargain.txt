Mrs. Leicester troubled herself very little about
lier matchmaking. When she happened to observe
Mrs. Austin and Mr. South she thought they
seemed to be very good friends ; and when they
were out of sight she supposed that they were together
somewhere and getting on nicely. She did
not quite know what she would get them for a
wedding present, but she determined to run upto
town with Frank and look about her. There
were sure to be pretty things in the shops. Meanwhile
she was very well satisfied. Frank seemed
all right, and, that being so, Mrs. Leicester hardly
noticed that, as the days went by, his little cousin
VOL. ir. B

was not quite her simple, happy self of a fortnight
earlier, and that these two, who had been such
allies, were no longer on their old footing.

Gilbert made no attempt to resume the talk
which was broken off in the ruined castle. He
appeared to have tacitly accepted Mrs. Austin's
offer of friendship without explanations ; and
though from time to time he would turn to her
with some allusion to the past, some "Do you
remember?" which sent her thoughts away from
Culverdale to scenes where he alone could follow,
he touched always on those earlier recollections
which needed no apology from him and no pardon
from her. She would answer readily enough ;
but Gilbert, who remembered the time when she
believed in him, was apt to imagine a delicate yet
unmistakable irony in her untroubled smile. To
Frank it revealed a wonderful, far-off tranquillity ;
but then Frank was very much in love. Mrs.
Austin had opened his eyes, and he was prepared
to spend his life in a rapturous study of this first
miracle. He felt himself at a disadvantage with

regard to South, who could look back to a past
in which she had a share, instead of a degrading
memory of measles and extreme youth ; yet, in
spite of his humility, he was not unhappy. Mrs.
Austin could not fail to perceive his devotion, but
she never for one moment supposed that there
was anything serious or lasting in it. It seemed
to her like a little nosegay of spring flowers, which
she might accept with a gracious word of thanks,
and she was touched by the thought of its very
transitoriness. She was very kind to Frank.
Within a week she had learnt his ways and looks
and words as one might learn the few simple notes
of a bird in one's garden ; and yet they pleased
her better than a more elaborate performance.
Poor fellow ! " she would say to herself, with a
half whimsical regret, "it is not my fault  I
cannot help it ; but if he only knew Jiovj young
he seems to me, how he would hate me !" There,
however, she was wrong. Frank would have
forgiven her even that.

The warm September days slipped away one

after the other, and the only thing of which the
young lover could complain was that they were
shortened in a quite unjustifiable way, which was
not mentioned in the almanac. The sun was slow
to rise ; but when once breakfast-time had arrived,
he rushed across the heavens, went headlong down
the west, and Frank found himself dressing for
dinner, with the certainty that only a few short
hours parted him from bedtime. It is true that
the nights had grown long, so long that they could
not all be spent in sleep. His light burned late,
and even when it was extinguished it did not
follow that he was at rest. Sometimes he was
star-gazing. He had never taken such particular
notice of the stars before, but they attracted him
now because they reminded him of Mrs. Austin.
He had made the discovery that certain things 
besides old teapots  were in harmony with Mrs.
Austin, and consequently possessed something of
her charm ; and he was beginning a classification
of the contents of the universe, as tried by this
test. He felt that the midnight sky was very

sublime, and that he himself was absurdly unimportant.
How could he become more worthy of
notice ? What sort of destinies used people to
fancy they read in the stars ? Frank, as he leaned
against his window and fixed his eyes upon the
far-off points of light, reflected that in all probability
he would be High Sheriff one of these days.
He wondered whether Mrs. Austin would like a
man to be Sheriff. But that would only be fora
year. Perhaps it would be better to try to
get into Parliament. There was a neighbouring
borough which was something of a forlorn hope 
he might try that. There must be an election
before long ; perhaps Mrs. Austin would comedown,
wear his colours, encourage his supporters,
and rejoice in his victory. Only  confound it ! 
the ballot had spoilt all the fun, and there was no
chance of a real good contest, such as they used
to have in old times, when the flags were flying,
the money going, and the agents outwitting each
other for days together. He would have liked the
gathering excitement of a prolonged battle ; he

would not even have minded a little rioting ; in
fact, an unfriendly mob, howling down any attempt
at speech, and to be confronted only with good-humoured
coolness and the superior manners of a
gentleman, seemed less terrible to Frank than
cold-blooded voters asking questions about his
views on unexpected subjects. Nevertheless, for
Mrs. Austin's sake, he would face even that ordeal.
He remembered, moreover, that the father of one
of the neighbouring landowners had been made a
baronet  why might not he be made a baronet ?
It is true that, for his own part, he had no especial
desire to be called "Sir Francis," but "Lady
Leicester" seemed to him a name not unworthy
to be uttered softly, at night, in the presence of
the stars.

Mrs. Austin knew nothing of these soaring
dreams, which only awaited a word from her lips"
to become serious intentions. She had no particular
ambition on Frank's behalf; in fact, the
young squire and his surroundings seemed to her
almost ideally perfect. The very heaviness of life

at Coverdale pleased her; there was something
solid, respectable, and sincere about it ; a sense of
prosperous restfulness and security rooted deeply
in the earth that she found charming  for a fortnight.
She liked to walk with Frank under his
spreading trees, and call up faint visions of wives
and sisters of bygone squires, who had known
those great trunks as slender saplings, and lived
and died under their gradually widening shadows.
She could even find names for a few of these
phantoms, for she had been to the neat little
church (Frank's father had restored it), and had
seen their monuments, with urns, and cherubs,
and festoons of marble drapery, upon the walls.
It was strange to look at Frank, with the sunshine
glancing through a little lancet window on his
head, and to think that he too would have a tablet
on these neat cold walls one day, and that other
guests would stay at the Hall, and come on Sundays
and study it during service time. Frank, at
her elbow, read the responses, with a consciousness
of his importance to the Established Church,

which might have been absurd if it had not been
so simple and honest. He sat through the sermon
in an attitude expressive of deeper interest than
Mrs. Austin found practicable. How was she to
know that the whole of that discourse, as the
young man heard it, was about herself?

For her own part, she had dreams, but, less
happy than Frank, her dreams were of the past
instead of the future. When Gilbert South had
asked her if she remembered the old time at West
Hill, she had answered, " Perfectly." It was quite
true ; the picture was there, but it had not been
called up for years as his words called it up.
Even when he did not speak, the knowledge that
it was continually in his thoughts seemed to give
it a kind of independent existence. Mrs. Austin
found herself recalling it in idle moments, and
dwelling on all manner of little incidents and
details which had been thrust into the background
by later events. The old house and garden rose
up before her as she knew them in her childish
days ; the gateway hung with ive, the apple-tree.

under her bedroom window, warped, and leaning
away from the strong west winds ; the countless
blossoms of narcissus and daffodil in early spring.
She remembered the hoarse roar of the sea as she
lay in bed on stormy nights, the shrieking of the
hurrying gusts, the fierce lashing of the driven
drops upon the pane, and then the stillness and
the rain-washed sweetness of the morning when
she woke. It all came back to her, even to the
tufts of fern, and the small green leaf-cups growing
on the garden wall ; but it came back with
that peculiar charm of tender remembrance which,
combining many impressions of that which we
have lost, creates one more beautiful than all.
She saw it with a deeper colour in the sea, a
wilder splendour of sunsets, a pearly clearness in
the morning sky, and a wonderful purity in the
lucid depths of air. More than once since she
came to Culverdale it had chanced to her, falling
asleep at night, while poor Frank was seeking his
fortune in the stars, to dream that she saw Gilbert
coming towards her along the grassy path. It

was almost impossible to wake from such a
dream, and not to look with curious interest at
the real man when he came down to breakfast.

With all these preoccupations it was hardly
surprising that Mrs. Austin did not give much
thought to Tiny Vivian, beyond a vague and
general goodwill, which the girl did not return.
Tiny had never changed her mind about Mrs.
Austin. " I said I shouldn't like her, and I don't,"
she triumphantly repeated one day as she stood
talking to Frank.

"It's a fine thing to be consistent, isn't it?"
said Frank drily.

"It's much better than changing one's mind
for ever. I can't see anything so very wonderful
about her. Of course she has been good-looking,
but so have lots of people, according to what they
say. And anybody might talk in that affected
way, as if her words were much more precious
than anybody else's. It makes me cross."

"So I see."

I could talk like that, and walk like that

MRS. AUSTIN 11

too ! Look here." And Tiny swept round the
room in an imitation of Mrs. Austin, which would
have been very tolerable to anybody but Frank.

"Oh, of course!" he said. "That's always the
way. Let one woman get hold of another, and
one knows what to expect."

And pray what does one expect ? "

"Well, neither justice nor mercy. I suppose
you can't help it."

Oh, indeed ! " said Tiny. " Then I should like
to know what Mrs. Austin says of me I "

As far as I know she doesn't say anything,"
he answered coolly.

Tiny was pained at Frank's manner, but she
looked him in the face and smiled only the more
resolutely. " No," she said, " of course she
doesn't. That's just what I say. She's awfully
stuck up and cold. I can quite understand her
jilting Mr. South."

"How do you know she did jilt Mr. South?"
he inquired in an irritating tone.

"Why, Frank, didn't she go and marry that

other man ? Of course she jilted him, and she'd
do it again just as likely as not, only I hope he
won't give her the chance. He's worth fifty of her !
Oh my goodness ! " Tiny exclaimed with a hurst of
defiant laughter, 'what a regiment that would be !"
It was quite right that Tiny should speak up
for Mr. South, since but for him she would have
stood a chance of being somewhat neglected.
Gilbert, however, would not suffer that. Apart
from the fact that he found Tiny very fascinating,
with her great eager eyes, her quick smiles, and
the supreme charm of being still in her teens, he
could never endure to see any one slighted. His
nature was sweet and kindly to the core, and he
was always ready to give the sympathy, which, to
say the truth, he required rather lavishly. He
liked to talk about himself in tones of confidential
melancholy, slightly dashed with bitterness. But
he would talk to you just as readily about yourself,
showing a gentle warmth of interest which
was flattering and agreeable. This kind of thing
was new to Tiny. Frank was not in the habit of

saying much about his inner feelings, and certainly
would not have known what to make of Tiny's if
she had attempted to express them. Perhaps the
girl had been less conscious of having such feelings
to express before Mr. South came. It was new to
her, too, being accustomed to play a subordinate
part, in consequence of youth and inexperience, to
meet with some one who considered youthful
impressions of far greater value than the dull and
blunted opinions of middle age. The squires and
rectors about Culverdale did not express such
views, nor did their wives and daughters set such
value on the artless ideas of a girl who had been
nowhere and known nobody. Tiny in a simple
unthinking way had loved the country lanes and
meadows among which she had been brought up,
but with Mr. South's arrival came a quickened
consciousness of their beauty and of her feelings
about them. She was already a little less simple
in consequence of his worship of simplicity, and
her great brown eyes were more eager, and sometimes
more thoughtful.

The time passed on till Mrs. Austin's visit was
within three days of its close. She was to leave
Culverdale on the Thursday, and this was the
Monday evening, when a garden-party at the
house of some friends of the Leicesterss ended in
an impromptu dance. Gilbert came up to her as
she sat fanning herself, and watching the revolving
couples. She shook her head in answer to his
request. "Don't ask me," she said. "I haven't
danced for years." And she glanced, not without
a touch of amusement, at Frank, who had already
been rejected, and who stood a little way off, very
erect and melancholy.

"Why not?" said Gilbert.

My dancing days are over," she replied simply.
Go and dance with some of these young people.
I see plenty of pretty girls who will be quite ready
for a new partner."

He neither moved nor answered, and she turned
her head and looked up at him from her low chair.
He stood by her side with downcast eyes, pulling
his moustache with what would have looked

MRS. AUSTIN 15

almost like an air of irritation, if she had not
known that he was never really out of temper.
His expression and attitude reminded her of old
days, when he was apt to be offended for a moment
because some one had laughed at him, and he
never liked to be laughed at. But after a brief
pause she looked at him more attentively. Old
use had taught her to read Gilbert's face like an
open book, more readily than any other face on
earth, yet there was something perplexing in it
now. Did he care so much to dance with her ?
She leaned back and waited, knowing that he was
sure to speak before long.

It is always the same thing," he said presently.
"This is over, and that is over. And when I
remember you everything was just beginning."

But that was a long while ago  as I think we
have frequently remarked."

Gilbert's eyes were fixed on a bit of scarlet
geranium which had fallen on the floor. " Yes,"
he said, " I have missed everything somehow."

One would think you were a second Eip van

Winkle, you seem to find it so hard to realise the
lapse of time. You haven't by chance been asleep
for a dozen years or so, have you?"

Upon my word I don't know. I think
perhaps I may have been." He moved the bit of
red blossom with his foot, and studied it under its
new aspect. " Asleep and dreaming perhaps," he
said in a low voice.

Well," Mrs. Austin replied, " as far as I am
concerned there is no great difficulty. Since you
know the year in which I was born, you have
only to buy an almanac, or to look at the top of
a newspaper, and I think you will be able to
calculate that I am thirty-seven."

Oh, I know that very well. You will not let
me forget it."

Will not let you forget it ? Could you forget
it if I would let you ?"

Sto," said South, lowering his voice still more.
I don't suppose I could. I have learnt my lesson,
I think. But I can swear to you that I never
remembered it till you taught me."

MRS. AUSTIN 17

The music stopped abruptly as he spoke, and
seemed to make a sudden vacancy in the air, into
which there poured a confused murmur of voices
and sweeping of dresses as the dancers strolled by.
Among them, with a carmine flush on her soft
brown cheek, went Tiny Vivian, and raised her
long lashes for one brilliant glance as she passed.
"Miss Vivian looks especially well to-night,"
Mrs. Austin remarked, looking after her, and
Gilbert murmured some reply, but the expression
which had perplexed his companion deepened on
his face. Her attention was distracted for a
moment by the arrival of the master of the
house, a stout white whiskered old gentleman, who
benignantly expressed the opinion that it was a
pleasant sight to see the young people enjoying
themselves. When she had agreed with him as
completely as he could wish, she looked quickly
round, but the tall figure had vanished from her
side.

He had gone away to follow once more a useless
round of thought which had grown drearily

VOL. II. c

III

familiar to him of late. He was haunted by the
memories which he had called up. He had tried
to bring them to life again, and instead they flitted
round him like mocking ghosts, to be seen but
never to be touched. Those happy days in
Cornwall were like the opening of a poem, but it
had ended in the flattest and feeblest prose. At
twenty he was to have been a hero, at thirty-nine
he was nothing, and he knew that he never
would be anything. The experience was not remarkable,
but in most cases the contrast is
rendered endurable by the gentle influence of
time. We become accustomed to it before it is
so terribly defined, and half forget the splendour
of the starting-point before we reach the pitiful
goaL But South was not so fortunate. He saw
them both, and saw them always, in Mildred's
eyes.

As he stood by the door gazing idly round, his
glance suddenly encountered Tiny Vivian's. She
looked at him as if she dimly divined his trouble,
but turned away her head the moment he noticed

her, and yet that swift glance, with its vague
proffer of sympathy, came like a ray of light into
his dull perplexity. Tiny's eyes, at least, had no
reflection of a mocking past in them, and never
told him that he was a failure.

It happens occasionally that an unexpected chill
will suddenly depress us, an undefinable blight
which seems to come from nowhere in particular
and to be everywhere. The weather may have
something to do with it, but the chill is within us
as well as without, and the outward aspect of
things can only emphasise its dreariness.

Something of the kind befell the inhabitants of
the Manor House on the Tuesday morning. Everyone
was dull, the sky was clouded, and the world
seemed to have grown old. Gilbert South had a
harassed and weary expression, Tiny owned to a
headache, Mrs. Leicester was worried by the
knowledge that fifteen people were coming to
dinner, and that she must keep awake all the

MKS. AUSTIN 21

evening, and Frank was conscious of nothing but
the shadow of Mrs. Austin's approaching departure.
Mrs. Austin herself was inclined to think that she
had had more than enough of Culverdale. She
had never known a place which depended so much
on the sunshine for what beauty it possessed, and, in
the uniformly diffused shadow, the low-lying park
and the meadows with their lines of hedge and ditch
oppressed her with a sense of unendurable
monotony. There was really nothing to distinguish
one enclosure from another, unless it were the
presence of cows or sheep. One would have said
that the soil of Frank's inheritance was heavy
with the dulness of many generations, which rose
on sunless days like an exhalation, not precisely
poisonous, since good family feelings and respectable
virtues would take no harm in it, but far too
dense for winged and delicate fancies. Consequently
there was no chance of escaping from it
even in thought. In truth there seemed no limit
to its influence. Mrs. Austin, while she dressed,
looked across the river to the village, and saw how

the church stood solidly planted among its white
gravestones, and pointed with a sharp little spire
to a gray and dreary region on high. It was
hardly an encouraging prospect.

Frank, poor fellow, suffered from her depression.
He was too closely connected with his surroundings
to be a congenial companion on such a
day ; his acres burdened him and dragged him
down, and he found her not unkind, but languid
and cold. Gilbert South might perhaps have
called up other scenes and times by the mere
sound of his voice, but he was silent at breakfast-time,
and disappeared almost immediately afterwards.
It was vaguely understood that he had
important letters to write. And, after all, Mrs.
Austin was not very sure that she needed any
company. As she sat in the drawing-room, turning
the pages of a novel as an excuse for silence,
she half-unconsciously followed a thread of thought
which stretched backward to her girlish days
and onward to her future. She was still pursuing
it in the afternoon when she drove with Tiny

Vivian to the neighbouring town to make some
purchases for Mrs. Leicester.

The little town remained in her memory as a
picture, as places sometimes do, which, being seen
but once, in one mood and under one aspect, are
not blurred and confused by conflicting impressions.
The sullen clouds were as much a part of it as
the foot-worn pavement, and a man with an organ*
grinding a tune which had been popular a season
or two before, was just as important as the vicar
who went by with a bundle of little tracts and
bowed to Miss Vivian. The carriage stopped and
went on as Tiny dh'ectecl, the tradesmen started
out of their shops as if somebody had pulled a
string, and stood bareheaded and smiling at the
door while she consulted Mrs. Leicester's list of
commissions. At one place she went in, and Mrs
Austin was left alone in a little square. The Town
Hall was there, erected mdcccxliii., and there
also was a drinking-fountain with an inscription
which she could not read. The great clock overhead
struck four like a knell, and startled her just

as she was thinking that Gilbert South certainly

was not a hero, and yet And a moment later

Tiny came out and said " Home " to the coachman.

They did not talk much as they drove back.
When the lodge-keeper swung the gate open at
the sound of their approach, it occurred to Mrs.
Austin to wonder what Tiny had been thinking
about so intently all the time.

That evening, after dinner, South came to her,
and stood for a few minutes turning over some
photographs which lay at her elbow. One of
them was of a place which he knew and she did
not, and in answer to a question of hers he described
it. He pressed his hand on the table ashe
spoke, and a white scar across one of his fingers
stood out more prominently and caught Mrs.
Austin's eye.

That cut of yours left a mark," she said, when
he had finished. "How frightened I was  do
you remember ?"

Gilbert looked first at his hand and then at her
with a strange, startled expression, almost as if he

felt a throb of pain in his old wound. " Yes," he
said, " I remember." And all at once the colour
came into his face as if he were a boy again.
I was cutting a stick for your brother Jack," he
added hurriedly, "and the knife slipped. Your
mother tied it up for me."

Yes, we found her in her storeroom. I think
Jack thought you were going to die." Mrs
Austin, for a moment, instead of seeing seven or
eight country gentlemen, most of them bald, and
as many ladies, grouped in the Culverdale drawing-room,
saw a sunshiny room, full of shelves and
cupboards and boxes, where, her mother, with
capable hands, was bandaging that finger of
Gilbert's, while Jack (poor fellow ! he died at
school) stood looking on, scared at first, and then,
when he found that mother could set it all right,
a little aggrieved because after all he hadn't got
his stick. Oh, how long ago it all was, and how
sadly the old home was broken up ! She would
have liked to take Gilbert's left hand in hers and
hold it, just for the sake of that little scar and the

dear people who were dead. And how deeply the
memory of that time touched him ! Why did he
colour up so suddenly at her question and turn
away? Was there something special about this
one incident ? All at once it struck her that
hitherto it had been Gilbert, and not she, who had
said "Do you remember?" Was he so pleased
that she should say it ? She recollected, too, that
it was while he still had his hand bandaged that
he spoke to her one evening by the white roses.
and she promised to wait for him till he should
come back to the old home. Perhaps that remembrance
had called up his blush. Poor Gilbert,
could he never forget his boyish inconstancy ?

Mrs. Leicester heaved a deep sigh of relief when
her guests were gone. "Dear me!" she said
suddenly to Mrs. Austin, "is tomorrow really
your last day with us ? What are you all going
to do tomorrow ? "

There was a pause. " Are not we going to row
down the river to some farmhouse ? " Mrs. Austin
inquired, looking round.

To old Green's," said Frank.

"Speak for yourself, my dear," said Mrs.
Leicester, laughing and nodding. " You don't
catch me rowing' down rivers. I shall have to die
some day, I suppose, but there are plenty of ways
of doing it without being drowned."

"Drowned?" Mrs. Austin repeated, with a
glance at Frank.

My mother wouldn't venture on a ditch in a
lifeboat without making her will and saying goodbye
to me," he answered.

"No," Mrs. Leicester replied, in a tone of
cheerful assent. " I'm a coward about the water.
It's a very good thing everybody isn't like me.
I'm sure I should never have found America or
Australia or any of those places."

"No," said Frank, "nor the Isle of Wight.
You might have seen it was there, like the
moon."

I thought you said you must go to the Carle-tons
tomorrow," said Tiny in a low voice to
Mrs. Leicester.

"Good gracious, so I must. I forgot. And
you must go there with me, you know."

"I won't drown you, if you'll trust me," said
Frank to Mrs. Austin.

I'm not afraid," she smiled. " But you see it
seems as if nobody would be able to go."

You said you should like it," Frank persisted,
turning his back to the others, and looking fixedly
at her.

It would be very pleasant if it is a fine day,"
she replied quietly. " But I don't want you to go
entirely for me. I thought we were all going."

I am going anyhow," he said, " tomorrow or
the next day. I want to speak to Green. Of
course you will do what you like best. I thought
you said you would like it."

I am so sorry I must take Tiny," said Mrs.
Leicester. " Old Mrs. Carleton is her godmother,
and she wants to see her, so I really must. What
will you do ? "Will you come with us, or will you
go with Frank ? I'm sure he is always very careful,
and of course there isn't any danger really."

MRS. AUSTIN 29

Mrs. Austin had no desire to make Frank
miserable on the last day of her stay. " Oh, I
should like the row very much 'if it is fine," she
said.

"That's settled then," said Mrs. Leicester
cheerfully. "Mr. South, if there's nothing you
want to do tomorrow, I'm sure we shall either of
us be very pleased if you'll join us."

Frank scowled. But Gilbert, while he professed
his delighted readiness to go anywhere or do anything,
had not the slightest intention of proposing
to make one of the water party. He was convinced
that it would be fraught with peril  for him.
That hot-headed boy would certainly do his best
to upset me into the river if I interfered with his
arrangements," he said to himself. " If he could
contrive to give me a ducking, without splashing
her, it would fill his soul with pure delight."
Gilbert thought he would cal on old Mrs. Carleton,
who was unlikely to indulge in any such pranks.

Mrs. Leicester was really sorry that she was
obliged to break up the party on this last day.

She could not see for her part why Mildred and
Mr. South had not settled matters a week ago,
and enjoyed themselves comfortably as an engaged
couple, taking their share of privileges and joking
remarks. But she supposed it was to be put off
till the end of Mildred's visit, and she was anxious
to give Gilbert a chance of coming to the point.
She had noticed that Frank seemed to prefer Mrs.
Austin to Mr. South, and was inclined to bestow
the attention which should have been divided
between his guests entirely on her. Frank was
inconsiderate at times, but she would give him a
quiet hint to leave the two to themselves when
they came back from their respective expeditions.
Gilbert South, unconscious of her beneficent
schemes, woke the next morning to a dreary
certainty that his visit to Culverdale had been a
mistake from first to last. For years he had
remembered Mildred Fairfax as the truest, the
most loving, the most beautiful of womankind.
He had dreamed of seeing her again, their meeting
had been the one desirable possibility of his life.

At last it had come ; and he had found her no
longer young, beautiful still in her widowhood, but
pale, calm, clear-sighted, self-possessed, putting
aside his attempt to utter his repentance with
gentle words about friendship. Frank might well
worship her in his boyish fashion ; he was quite
right, he had never seen Mildred Fairfax. But
for his own part, Gilbert, had he known her
intentions, instead of gratefully blessing good
Mrs. Leicester, would rather have been inclined
to complain to her, very ungratefully and unjustly,
" You have

Unsettled the pure picture in my mind ;
A girl, she was so perfect, so distinct.
. . I detest all change,
And most a change in aught I loved long since."

That was the worst of it. He could not even go
back to his dream. Call them up as he would
with anxious efforts, his memories of his old love
had been slowly dying, day by day, ever since he
came to Culverdale. The actual recollections remained
cold, dead facts, but nothing more. There

were moments when Tiny Vivian, just because of
her youth and hopefulness, seemed nearer the true
spirit of his former love than Mrs. Austin. It
was not unnatural. If we idealise the past, and
most of us do, there is an interval after which old
books should not be reopened, old haunts should
not be revisited, nor old loves sought out, except
with a deliberate dew to disenchantment. We
expect too much. No sjnnpathy is so perfect as
that which we imagine. And Gilbert South had

o

been especially fanciful and dreamy in his recollections.
He had had, as it were, just a glimpse
of Mildred's pure, girlish love, and then he had been
drawn away by a woman older than himself who
wanted a little amusement. He had been made a
fool of, coarsely, by a practised flirt. Afterwards
he attempted to go back ; he wrote a dozen letters
of explanation and repentance, and of course sent
off the worst. It was a failure, and partly in
pique, partly in real disgust at himself, for he had
a delicate taste, and his first faithlessness left an
unpleasant flavour in his mouth, he swore constancy

to Mildred's memory as he supposed, but in
reality to himself as he would have had himself.
It was that former self as well as his former love
he had hoped to find again when he met Mrs.
Austin.

With her it was different. She had trusted
him and he had failed her; the pain had been
keen, but with a touch of scorn in it. And later,
when the wound was healed and all bitterness
gone, she thought of him, not unkindly, but as
one whose nature was light and fickle. When
she discovered how constantly he had looked back
to that old love which she supposed was utterly
forgotten, her memory awoke like the autumn
blossoming of spring flowers.

On that last day all the interest seemed to be
concentrated on the water expedition, as if it were
indeed a voyage of vast importance. Nobody
thought about the people who meant to call on
old Mrs. Carleton, but one would have said that
Frank and Mrs. Austin were going to discover a
new island at least, and indeed the young fellow

VOL. II. D

had such an impression concerning it as, if it
happens to be verified, we call a presentiment.
Mr. South and Tiny came down to the river to see
them off, but, owing to some little delay in Frank's
arrangements, they were obliged to go back, lest
they should keep Mrs. Leicester waiting, and leave
Mrs. Austin where she stood, a slim dark figure at
the water's edge. The dull gray surface, with its
floating leaves and its grasses drawn by the silent
current, was shaded by great groups of trees,
whose dusky greenness was lighted here and thereby
gleams of autumn yellow. Mrs. Austin did
not move, no breath of wind stirred the dark
masses of foliage overhead ; it was like a picture
with something of melancholy stateliness about it.
When Frank was ready the solitary figure disappeared
from the bank, and they went gliding
from under the shadow of the trees out into the
wide, sunless fields.

Honestly, it was not a very beautiful scene.
To Frank, who had known it all his life, the question
of its beauty or ugliness did not occur ; it

was simply the river, and as such it had moulded
his conception of all rivers. On its dull waters
such childish dreams as he had known had embarked
and set sail. As a boy he had fished there,
just as four or five urchins were fishing now.
They stared, open-mouthed and silent, at younger.
Leicester and his boat, but took no notice of
the lady who looked with a musing smile at
the little rustic group as she went by. Presently
came a curve in the stream, where a clump of
alders grew, and bushes leaned despondently over
the water which was eating the earth away from
their roots. The more distant prospect showed a
monotonous variety of ploughed land and pasture,
with lines of trees following the hedges, and here
and there a cottage or two and a bit of road. Mrs.
Austin and Frank talked as they went. He told
her how one bitter winter the river was frozen,
and he skated to the farm where they were going
now. He pointed out a lonely house, and spoke
of the people who lived there. He showed her
how far the floods had reached in a wet season,

a muddy expanse in which little files of cropped
willows seemed to wade knee-deep, and the water
washed through the gates of lost meadows. And
he broke off suddenly in the midst of what he was
saying to ask, "Where shall you be this time tomorrow?"


"Half-way to London, I should think," she
answered ; " I don't know how long the journey
takes."

Frank looked at her and was silent. He
wondered whether he should speak as they came
back.

The Greens' house stood by the roadside a little
way from the river. The farm-buildings and
some big stacks had a pleasant prosperous air, but
the house itself was an ugly little plastered box,
with a bit of treeless garden in front, blossoming
with prim sulphur coloured dahlias. Frank did
not seem to have much to say to old Green after
all. The two exchanged a few words and then
came to the little parlour, where ]airs. Austin
sat on a horsehair sofa giving the latest news of

MRS. AUSTIN 37

Mrs. Leicester and Miss Vivian to the farmer's
wife. Frank was on very pleasant terms with his
tenants, who evidently thought their young landlord
a most important personage. Other people
were "high," but vaguely "high," and a duke
would not have impressed Mrs. Green as much as
Mr. Leicester from the Manor House. The Prince of
Wales, perhaps, as a young man residing in palaces,
and holding a well-defined position as the Queen's
son, might have eclipsed Frank, but it would have
taken a prince to do it. Mrs. Austin perceived,
with a slight smile, how unimportant she was
compared with her companion, but she was not ina
mood to be amused by that or anything else
that afternoon. She was glad to leave the house,
to escape from hospitable offers of cake and homemade
wine, and to find herself once more upon the
road. Even then, however, the old farmer insisted
that Frank should look at a shed which was not
satisfactory, and she had to wait while the matter
was discussed.

There was a little pond with neat white railings

just opposite the house, and she strolled across
and stood by it with a mysterious sense of loneliness
and desolation upon her. Still as the afternoon
was, she fancied that there was a mournful little
rustling in the boughs of a stunted oak which grew
a few yards away. The little pool mirrored a
vacant gray sky. It was absurd, and yet she felt
as if she would have given anything to see Gilbert
South coming towards her, instead of which it was
Frank, who tore himself away from the farmer
and darted across the road.

"I've kept you waiting," he said; "I'm so
sorry ! Oh, and you are tired, aren't you ?"

A little," she allowed. " Nothing to matter."

"It's too bad of me! What can I do?" he
exclaimed with anxious solicitude. " Come in
again and let Mrs. Green make you some tea."

Oh no, no," she said. " I would rather go
back."

Frank was in despair. He reproached himself.
"What a brute I am!"

Mrs. Austin fairly laughed at the intensity of

his remorse. " What would you do if I were very
tired?" she said.

He hardly dared to speak to her as they went
back, and perhaps it was owing to that enforced
silence that later he recalled with especial vividness
the plash of his oars on their quietly winding
way, the little ripples dying among the dry
autumnal reeds on either bank, and the light from
the west, where a pale sun struggled feebly
through the clouds, falling coldly on the beautiful
face before him. For Mrs. Austin, meanwhile, a
soft current of thought flowed with the river,
setting ever more strongly towards a final resolution.
If it rested with her to make Gilbert South
happy, why should she not do it ? He was not
what she had once imagined him, yet he was truer
and better than she had believed him during the
years they had been parted. There was no man
living whose thoughts and memories, nay, whose
little tricks of speech and gesture, were bound up
with her past life as Gilbert's were; and the
recollection of his troubled face haunted her like

a reproach. "Why not?" she said to herself over
and over again, to the measured sound of Frank's
oars. " Why not ?  why not ?  if it would make
him happy."

I don't know why it is," she said to young
Leicester when they had landed, and were walking
slowly up to the house, " but I have had a feeling
all this afternoon as if something were going to
happen."

That's funny," said Frank ; " so have I."

Have you really ? If I had known that I
might have wondered whether you were really
going to drown me. But here we are, safely
landed, in spite of our forebodings."

He surveyed the sullen sky. " Perhaps there's
thunder in the air," he suggested.

Perhaps. That might account for my feeling
tired. I've been a dull companion, I fear."

"Xo," Frank was beginning to say, when he
stopped short. They had just come in sight of
the house, and he stared at a farmer's chaise,
driven by a labouring man, which was going away

from the front door. " That's old Clayton's trap,"
he said ; " what on earth has that come here for ?
And  why, surely that's my mother coming to
meet us  they can't possibly have been there and
got back by this time !"

There has been an accident !" said Mrs.
Austin with sudden certainty. "Go and see
what has happened. Your mother is safe,
but "

Frank ran forward. It was his mother hurrying
down the drive. " What is it ? " he said.

"Oh, Frank!" she cried. "Oh, my dear boy!
Those dreadful horses ! "

What's the matter ? The new horses ?"

"Yes. We went by Upton Lane because I
wanted to inquire about Barker's wife  by the
railway cutting, you know. She likes to see one
if it's only for a minute  at least she did like,
poor thing 1"

Frank stamped impatiently. " Barker's

wife !" he said. "Is anybody hurt? Is anybody
dead?"

"She's dead  she died yesterday  nobody
else."

Oh, go on ! go on ! What happened ?"

Why, I went in just to speak to poor Barker

Barker's final destiny was so nearly settled

that Mrs. Leicester gasped and hurried on  " and
the express rushed by, at least I think it was the
express  they shouldn't make them scream so,
Frank, it isn't whistling, it's a downright scream
and the horses bolted down the lane to the left
and he couldn't hold them "

"The lane to the gravel-pit!" said Frank, in a
horror-struck voice.

Yes ! And Tiny and Mr. South 1 But they
dashed against a bit of wall at the turning, and
were thrown out."

"Are they hurt? Much?"

"No, nobody is hurt, only shaken. But oh,
Frank!"

The horses ?" said Frank, greatly relieved.

"Nothing much. Robinson says it's quite
wonderful. There's no harm done."

"What then?" Frank grasped his mother's
arm. " There's something more. Tiny is hurt 
I know she is. Why don't you say so ?"

No, she isn't ; she isn't indeed, nor Mr. South
either."

"Well?"

"They are not hurt," said Mrs. Leicester
desperately, "but they're engaged to be married !"

She looked as if she expected an explosion,
but none followed. Frank's hand unclosed and
dropped by his side, and he stood for a moment
staring dumbly at her. " Are you sure you didn't
fall out too, and pitch on your head ? " he said at
last.

"No, indeed; I was in the cottage when the
train came. Oh, it's quite true, Frank. You
know I really couldn't help it. Are you angry ?"

"Angry?" he repeated, "why should I be
angry ? Fm dreaming I think. It isn't a joke?"
he said suddenly with a threatening frown.

No ! oh no ! Is it wrong, do you think ?
What could I do ?"

"Tiny and South?" said Frank. "Tiny!
Well  if she likes him ! I don't see why it should
be wrong," he went on, bewildered, yet beginning
to perceive how in some ways it might be marvellously
right. " That's for her own people to decide.
If they haven't any objection  but Tiny and
South !"

You are not angry then ? You don't mind ? "

No, why should I ? If Tiny is happy it's all
right. But I don't seem able to believe it yet."

"Well, here is Mr. South," said Mrs. Leicester
more cheerfully. " Perhaps you'll believe him."

Frank looked up and saw South coming across
the grass. He was pale, but there was a peculiar
brightness about his face. His eyes were shining,
he smiled a little defiantly. Surprise is not the
easiest thing in the world to encounter, especially
if one is a little surprised at oneself. Gilbert had
only just found himself out. Before Frank could
take a step to meet him, Mrs. Austin, who had
come up during the explanation, went forward
swiftly and held out her hand.

Gilbert, is this true ?" she said. " I may
congratulate you, not only on your fortunate
escape, but on your engagement too ?"

(Mrs. Leicester in the background arched her
eyebrows and looked at Frank. " I had forgotten
her!" she whispered.)

South ceased to smile, but he met her questioning
eyes honestly enough. " Yes," he said slowly,
"it's quite true." He looked at her as if he
would have said more.

Then I wish you all happiness  I wish it
with all my heart," she replied. There was no
tremor in her soft clear voice. " I think our old
friendship gives me the right to be one of the first
to congratulate you."

Thank you," Gilbert replied confusedly. He
still held her hand, and looked anxiously at her
as if he feared some hidden meaning in her words.
'mildred!" he said, and there was a world of

pleading in his tone. " Tell me " he stopped

short. What was he going to say ?

Believe me," she said, and he felt her fingers

tighten on his in a kindly clasp as she spoke, " I
have always wished your happiness  always.
And I am glad to think that you have found it."
And with that she nodded a smiling little farewell
and walked towards the house.

Gilbert gazed after her with a throb of regretful
pain. He had known that it was impossible
to go back to the old days, Mildred had taught
him that. And yet as he looked over his shoulder
at her retreating figure, he had a strange fancy
that it was the very past itself, the past which he
had so long worshipped and from which he had
so suddenly awakened, which was at that moment
leaving him for ever, a stately shape passing
silently away and never looking back. He would
not have recalled her, since he could not recall the
Mildred who believed in him and looked at him
with happy hope in her eyes. It was Tiny who
believed in him now. Mildred had no need of
him. Tiny had called to him, " Gilbert'' in their
peril that afternoon, and his heart had answered
the innocently appealing cry, the name by which

she had never called him, uttered as her one word
then. Tiny had no need to grudge his old love
that one backward glance. It was all over in a
moment, and Gilbert drew a long breath, and
went forward to receive Frank's congratulations.

They were rather briefly and bluntly given.
Frank was eager to be gone ; the picture which
for Gilbert personified a softly sentimental regret
was for him a vision of hope which beckoned him
to follow. He uttered such good wishes as came
readily to his lips, and were suitable to anybody
who was going to be married. He realised the
accident by the gravel-pit more clearly than the
engagement, but he was too impatient and preoccupied
to talk much even about that. " It's a
mercy you weren't killed !" he said shortly.

Well, I suppose it was a narrow escape," Gilbert
answered with a smile.

*'A narrow escape  yes, I should think so. It
couldn't very well have been much narrower, as
far as I can see. However, a miss is as good asa
mile, I suppose."

So they say," Gilbert replied ; " but, for my
own part, I should prefer the mile next time.
And so would your cousin, I fancy."

All, Tiny knew what you were coming to !
It's no wonder if she was scared, poor child !" said
Frank. "There isn't a nastier place about here.
By the way, I haven't seen Tiny yet." And he
brushed past Gilbert and departed, as if to congratulate
Tiny were the one object of life.

He went by the stable-yard, where he speedily
ascertained that the amount of damage done was
so absurdly small that there was nothing serious
about the whole business, except what might
have been. He cut Robinson's explanations short,
and hurried to the house, where, as luck would
have it, he met Tiny in the hall. She looked a
little like Gilbert South, pale with agitation, and
yet radiant. Her great brovn eyes were shining,
and her lips quivered with excitement which
might end either in sobs or smiles. "Oh, Frank,"
she exclaimed ; and she too looked up anxiously
to see how the young master received the news.

"Well," said he, taking her hands in his;
"this is a pretty afternoon's work! What will
your people at home say, do yon suppose ? "

Oh, my people at home ! They'll say what I
say," Tiny answered, with a tremulous laugh. " I
shall make them."

"And what do you say ?"

Oh, Frank ! isn't it strange ? I'm so glad, but
I want you to say you are glad too. Frank, you
do like him now, don't you ? You are not vexed ?"

No, I'm not vexed if you are happy. Oh, I
like him well enough. But I think you ought to
have had somebody younger," he said doubtfully.

Oh no, Frank," Tiny replied, with great
decision. "It doesn't matter the least bit when
it's the man. If it were the woman, now, it
would matter ; but not when it's the man."

Well, you know best." And Frank released
one of his hands. " I'm sure I wish you all happiness.
It comes rather suddenly," he said, with a
laugh.

So it did to me," Tiny replied ; " and I'm not

VOL. II. E

sure he would have told everybody directly, but
we were in the Barkers' garden ; we couldn't go
in because poor Mrs. Barker is dead, you know?
and we were waiting till they got something to
bring us home "

"Oh, that's where it was settled?"

Yes," Tiny answered, with a conscious little
laugh. " Xo ; I think it was settled as we
tumbled out, but that was where he said it properly.
And your mother came round the corner
upon us "

I see," said Frank.

"They do grow such a lot of southernwood
there," Tiny went on, as the colour rushed to her
cheeks. " He leant against the palings, and there
was a great bush of it. He smelt like a Sunday-school
nosegay as we were coming back ; but he
says he shall always like it now."

The sight of Tiny, alive, laughing, and talking
nonsense with quivering lips, suddenly brought the
thought of her peril vividly before Frank. " Oh,
Tiny !" he said, "you might have been killed !"

Don't," she said ; " I saw it all  the gravel-pit,
you know, just as we went down into it one
day ; do you remember ? Ever so long ago, almost
the first time I stayed here. I saw it all, as if
there were a terrible light in it, and I said to myself,
'I shall die there!' And then I called to
Gilbert, and I remember his face for one moment,
and we got to the turning, and before we could
jump out it was all over; and there we were,
picking ourselves up, and none the worse !"

"Thank God!" said Frank.

Only so dusty ; and somehow I felt very small
when I found it had all ended in nothing at all."

Frank laughed. "Never mind; it was better
than being a smashed heroine."

"And it has ended in something, only a
different sort of thing, hasn't it ? " said Tiny.
"Where is everybody, Frank? In the drawing-room
?"

Everybody ? No ; I left him with my mother
on the lawn."

Tiny made a face at him. " Oh, by the way, I

\i''''\n Of Vl!''

know Mrs. Austin isn't there. I met her a minute
ago on the stairs, and she kissed me and congratulated
me. I say, who told her?"

She heard my mother telling me, I believe."

Oh, I wondered if Gilbert had. Do you
suppose she minds much ? "

I don't believe she minds at all," said Frank.
'' Why should she ? She told him she was very
glad."

I believe she does mind, though," Tiny nodded.
She was very fond of talking about old times."

"Rubbish !" Frank exclaimed ; "you're as bad
as my mother ! " and he walked off, leaving Tiny
happily convinced that it was impossible Mrs.
Austin should not envy her the possession of
Gilbert's love.

Now or never !" he said to himself as he went
slowly up the stairs. His life hung in the balance,
his heart was beating fast, and every throb brought
him nearer the decisive moment. He turned into
a little room where Mrs. Leicester and Tiny sometimes
sat. He would lie in wait for Mrs. Austin

there, she must pass the door as she went
down.

Frank leant against the window, looking at the
dim undulations of the landscape, and vaguely
recognising familiar points. It was strange to
stand in that little room which he had known all
his life  he could remember learning his lessons
there at his mother's knee  waiting for his fate to
come to him. At any moment it might come,
with a quiet step, and the soft sweeping of her
dress in the passage. Before a dozen more of
those strong heart-throbs were over her eyes
might be meeting his. She would look him in the
face he knew, but what would she say. to him ?
Frank had never thought less of himself than he
did at that moment, and yet beneath all his anxiety
he had an unreasoning faith in his good luck.
Fortune had always been kind to him ; people had
always done what he wanted them to do. Yes,
but Mrs. Austin was different. He dared not hope,
and yet the mere thought that success was possible
flushed him like a draught of wine. Then she

would not be Mrs. Austin but  Mildred ; he would
not have to count days and nights as steps towards
parting, they would all be his, other people would
come and go, but she would stay. When she said
horae " she would mean Culverdale. On that last
thought he dwelt with exquisite delight, as if he
could hear her uttering the word. It was the
wildest dream, yet in a few minutes that dream
might be his actual life ; that was the wonder of
it. And was not fortune smiling on him already ?
He had been afraid of Gilbert South, he had had
misgivings about Tiny's troubled eyes, and now
just at the right moment all his doubts and fears
had vanished away, he was free to go to his love,
and she was free to come to him. There could
be no shadow of reproach or regret between
them.

He heard her footfall in the passage, he called
Mrs. Austin ! " it paused, and she appeared on
the threshold of the open door. He had been
expecting her and watching for her, and yet when
she came in answer to his call he felt as if he

were taken by surprise and had not a word to say.
She stood in the doorway waiting for him to speak,
and on her delicate lips was that faint half-smile
which seemed to Frank to be the sum of all the
poetry in the world. '' What is it ? " she said.
Did you want me ? "

"Don't go down for a few minutes," he
entreated. " I have something to say to you."

She looked unsuspectingly at him. " Some
other time," she said ; " I really must go to your
mother."

My mother ? Oh, she will wait a few minutes
for me ! " And, before she could speak another
word, Frank, with eager eyes and stammering
speech, was telling the story of his love. Even ashe
looked at her pale, startled face, before she had
opened her lips to answer him, he knew that he
had failed. And yet failure, now that it had
actually come, seemed so incredible that Frank
tried to avert it by repeating what he had already
said, as if every second which elapsed before she
spoke was something gained. But all at once he

stopped short, with a sense of the utter uselessness
of any words.

Oh, I am sorry ! " said Mrs. Austin, meeting
his eyes with a simple, tender sorrow in hers.
She might have looked something the same if she
had inadvertently hurt some dumb creature in the
Culverdale woods.

'don't!" said Frank.

I never dreamed of this  never ! I'm more
sorry than words can say if anything I have said
or done "

No ! " Frank exclaimed. " You have done
nothing wrong. If I'm a fool I don't know that
it's my fault, but I'm sure it isn't yours ! "

She could not help smiling, so gentle a smile
that it could not wound him. "You must not
think of this," she said. " It can't be. For one
thing, you must remember that you are a young
man and I am an old woman. You will choose
better one of these days  you have your life before
you." She added after a moment, " Mine is behind
me, at least the best of it."

"Don't talk like that!" said Frank. "What
do a few years matter one way or the other ? I
would be older if I could, of course." (He could
wish to be changed, but he could desire no change
in her.) " But I shall grow older," he said, trying
to laugh.

She shook her head. " And so shall I ! "

If that is all," he exclaimed hotly, " it would
be cruel "

"But it isn't all. Believe me, Mr. Leicester,
what you ask is impossible."

I know I'm not good enough, but isn't there
anything I could do ? If I tried to get into
Parliament  should you like me to do that?"
said Frank desperately. His hurried thought
sought any possible advancement that might make
him more worthy in her eyes. " I'm not clever,
of course, but surely a man must be good for
something if he tries with all his heart. Tel me
what you would like me to do, and I'll doit!"


He stood opposite her : his face was pale and

keen with excitement : he looked so roused, so
manly, so earnest, that for one moment the thought
crossed Mrs. Austin's mind that if fate had but
sent Frank instead of Gilbert into that earlier life
of which she had spoken, he might have become
such a hero as she had dreamed. But it was only
a passing thought. Something told her that
Frank, as he spoke, touched the highest point of
which he was capable. It might be that he too
felt that at that moment the flood of passion and
resolution reached its limit, but he believed that
the wave, if not repulsed, would have force enough
to carry him onward through the lower waters of
his later life.

"I think you are good for a great deal," she
said, "but that isn't the question. You must
believe me when I tell you that I am very
sorry, but what you ask me can't be."

You are quite sure ? There is no chance forme?"


She paused for a moment, looking at him.
Then, as if it pained her to speak that last word,

she answered with a little negative movement of
her head.

The eager expression died out of his eyes and
his face relaxed. " Very well," he said. " Then I
suppose there's nothing to do but to say good-bye."
He seemed to be making an effort to master himself,
and Mrs. Austin looked aside at the window
and waited till he should speak again.

"See here," he said, after a brief silence, "I
shall tell my mother I have to go up to town on
business this evening, but that I'm coming down
tomorrow morning. I shall get away so without
any fuss, and tomorrow I shall telegraph that I'm
detained, and I shan't come back for a day or two."

Yes, I understand," she answered. " This is
good-bye. And when we meet again, I hope "

Frank had taken up a pencil which happened
to be lying on the table, dropped it, and stooped
to find it on the floor. He rose with a slight
flush on his cheek. " People don't always meet,"
he said. "Sometimes it's years first. Perhaps
we never shall meet again."

"Perhaps not. That is possible of course."
Mrs. Austin was a little puzzled by his manner.

The colour deepened on his face. " Well," he
said, " why should we ? If it must be all over,
let it be all over!" He looked at her, crimsoning
with the consciousness that he was saying something
altogether unlike his ordinary everyday talk.
I would rather we didn't meet. I would rather
say good-bye now. You understand, don't you ?
Eemember me a little as I am to-day."

I shall always remember you," she answered.

And let me remember you as you are. If we
chance to meet, why we must. But why should
we ? We never met till now. If it depends on
me, I think we never will meet again."

Mrs. Austin looked at him with an expression
which was at once startled and thoughtful, and a
faint tinge of rose on her pale face made answer
to Frank's blush. The entreaty, " Let me remember
you as you are," touched her strangely. She
knew that she was beautiful, but she knew also
that her beauty was on the wane, and there was

a melancholy pleasure in the thought that, though
for the world she might grow old, for this one
man she should always remain such as she was at
that moment of farewell. She could not marry
him, she did not love him, but womanlike she did
desire to be always young for her young lover.
She desired it too for her own sake. Otherwise
it seemed to her that the mere lapse of a few
years might turn Frank's passionate devotion and
her answering pity into a ridiculous joke. If she
were a faded elderly woman and he a heavy respectable
squire, would it be possible to remember
without laughter that they had ever felt and
spoken as they were feeling and speaking then ?
Why should not Frank have his way, foolish and
boyish though it might be ?

Let it be so, then," she said. " If you like it
best, we will say ' Good-bye ' here and now." She
looked at him very sadly. " I wish I had never
come here."

"No, no!" cried Frank, with sudden passion,
almost as if he thought that her wish could really

take her sweet unapproachable presence out of
his memory. " No ; I can part with you  I must
part with you  but I couldn't part with the time
I have had."

I feel as if I had done nothing but harm, and
yet I can't help it," she went on, half to herder.

How have you done any harm ? " Frank
demanded. " Because I love you, and you won't
have me ? Do you think "  this with an uncertain
laugh  " that I shall take to drinking, perhaps
 go to the dogs ? After loving you ?"

No, I don't think that ; but I'm sorry you
should have wasted your love on me."

"It isn't wasted," said Frank, after a pause,
gazing intently at the floor. "Look here, Mrs.
Austin, I shall never, as long as I live, love any
woman as I love you now. It can't be. One
must have one best love of all in one's life, and
I've given mine to you. But it isn't wasted for
all that. If ever I marry, and you hear of it,
you'll know that my love was better worth having
than it could have been if I had never seen you.

That isn't being wasted, is it ? And you have
done good instead of harm  no harm at all."

He looked up quickly, and saw that her eyes
were full of tears. " I think she will be a happy
woman who loves you and whom you love," she
said, half turning from him. " And now, goodbye."


Stay one moment more," he entreated. " Let
me have one last look. Eemember, I'm never
going to see you again ; I want to recollect you as
you are now."

She paused with perfect simplicity, and faced
him where he stood. He looked at her, turned
his eyes away for a moment, and then looked
back.

It's no good," he said. " When I look away
1 see you as I saw you that first night, when they
were playing, and you walked past me and were
not thinking of me. I can see you so any moment
I like. Or in the boat this afternoon  you were
not thinking of me then either. Perhaps afterwards
this will come back to me too," said Frank,

still gazing at her as if he would learn her face
with its far-off compassion by heart. "Well,
good-bye," he ended, with something of rough
abruptness in his tone. But even as he said it,
in the bitter wrench of parting, the sound of his
own voice jarred upon him with a sense of unfitness.
" Good-bye," he repeated, with the gentleness
he had learnt from her.

"Good-bye," said Mrs. Austin, and held out
her hand, white and with a ring sparkling in the
evening light.

He clasped it with the tender reverence which
that last touch demanded. " I should like you to
say ' Good-bye, Frank,' just for once, if you would,"
he entreated.

With a faint smile of assent she said it very
sweetly, drew her hand out of his, and went
away.

Frank stood where she had left him, at first
with feelings too exalted to be conscious of anything
but her beautiful sorrowful face, and the
sudden blank of her departure. But as his excitement

subsided, the gray light, which always finds
its way from the outer world into a passionate
sorrow, crept into his heart. There is nothing so
dreary as the realisation of loss under its commonplace
aspect, no longer as a blow, but as a lasting
absence of beauty and joy in dull days to come,
the foreshadowing of life's inevitable routine at
the moment when it is unendurable even to remember
that the days of the week will follow
each other in their accustomed order. Frank
hated Culverdale as he stood gazing out of the
window. There were streaks of yellow and sullen
red in the cloudy west, and it seemed to him that
never since the world began had there been so
ugly and cheerless a sunset. The wind was getting
up, and there was something inexpressibly mournful
in the shivering of the trees ; and yet he
stood there, looking and listening till the slow
striking of a distant clock startled him from his
reverie, and reminded him that he had no time to
lose.

As he went down he paused for a moment on

VOL. II. F

the stairs to make sure of his calmness, and, looking
into the shadowy hall below, he saw the door
of the drawing-room open, and Tiny come out.
When she passed, a slim dusky figure, before a
gray window, Frank could not have put the
thought into words ; but it was his turn to feel,
as Gilbert South had felt, as if he saw his old life
passing away with bowed head and lingering steps.
Tiny !" he called, and came flying down the stairs
in his impetuous fashion.

Yes," she said, and stopped short. She could
hardly see his face in the twilight.

"Tiny," said Frank breathlessly, "I'm going
away  I've had a letter. It's only till tomorrow
it's nothing. But I don't think I congratulated
you properly just now "

Oh yes, Frank, you did," said Tiny, who felt
that he must have congratulated her properly,
since he had thought enough about it to accuse
himself like this.

Iso, I didn't, not as I meant to. I hope you'll
be very happy, very happy, always."

Oh yes' said Tiny promptly, as if her uninterrupted
bliss were the simplest matter of
course.

"Look here," Frank continued, "this is a
sort of good-bye, because it won't be the same
thing now. You'll have South to think
of "

Oh, Frank, but I'm not going to forget
you !"

Xo, no," said Frank ; " we've been something
like brother and sister, haven't we ? " He held
her hand tightly in his, and looked at her through
the dusk. " I don't think I ever kissed you. Tiny,
even when you were little ; and after all we are
cousins, you know." She put up her face and
kissed him silently. The remembrance of all their
pleasant days at Culverdale was about them as
their lips met  it was like a shadowy little world
of meadow and copse and cornfield, garden and
river, bounded by the far horizon of childhood.
Both were conscious of that dim background
though Tiny's consciousness was only a half-sweet.

half-sad regret in the midst of new-found joy. As
for Frank, he felt that if South didn't make Tiny
very happy  always  he should like to horsewhip
him. And he would do it too ! For Tiny
must and should be happy, though he couldn't
be.

And I had a letter from Tiny this morning,"
she said. "The child seems quite absurdly happy."

It's a good thing for you that she is happy,"
said Frank. "You are responsible for that
marriage, you know."

How can you say so ? I'm sure I had
nothing to do with it. I never dreamt of such a
thing!"

Frank shook his head. " Oh, you're a terrible
matchmaker; there's no escaping you. If you
miss one you make another. Where is Tiny
now?"

"Some. Would you like to see the letter?"

He took the flimsy sheets, and deciphered
Tiny's dashing raptures rather laboriously. It
was the same Tiny; yet not quite the same.
There were pretty little airs of authority, and
turns of expression which showed that Tiny, who
had never been very important before, felt herself
something of a queen in her new life. There was
wonder at novel sights and experiences  he
seemed to see her wide brown eyes as he read 
and a profound belief in her husband's perfection.
Frank folded the letter and gave it back. He

perceived that there was no need for him to start
off to Some with a horsewhip to secure Tiny's
happiness. It was taken out of his hands altogether.


Having told her news, Mrs. Leicester began to
make inquiries. Had Frank seen anything of the
Stauntonss as he came through town ?

He had called there, and afterwards had been
asked to dine.

Well, then, what is this about Mrs. Austin ?
I had a note from Mrs. Staunton a day or two
ago, and she said she thought I should soon hear
some news about her that would surprise me.
What does she mean ?"

Frank looked vaguely in the direction of the
piano. " It means that other people can try their
hands at matchmaking as well as you."

Oh ! is she going to be married ? I thought
perhaps it was a sisterhood or something of that
sort. Is she really going to be married?"

Can't say. People don't always succeed with
their matches, you know. But there's a man

who admires her very iimch, it seems, and Mrs.
Staunton is always trying to bring them together.
It's a nice little amusement for her, I suppose;
she doesn't seem to have much else to do, except
drink afternoon tea."

'did you see Mrs. Austin?"

No," said Frank, still staring into space ; " she
was out of town."

And who is this man ? What is his name ? "

She was informed that his name was Rowland.

"But who is he? Tell me something about
him."

Oh ! I don't know. He's a middle-aged man
Fred Staunton pointed him out to me  getting
a little gray."

But you must know more about him than
that. What does he do?"

Breaks stones, I believe," Frank replied.

Mrs. Leicester looked so utterly astounded and
aghast that he began to laugh. " Oh, don't be
frightened!" he said. "It's all right. It all
depends on what you do it with. He breaks 'em

with a little hammer, and that's very respectable."


Oh, you mean that he's something  what do
you call it?  something geological?" she exclaimed,
and was much relieved.

That's about it," said Frank. He threw his
shoulders back and stretched his long arms.
Upon my word I think I'd sooner do an honest
day's work on the roads than go knocking off
little chips of stone and writing papers about 'em.
But I suppose he likes it."

'dear me!" Mrs. Leicester mused. "I
should really think it would be a very nice thing
for Mildred."

"I should leave her to decide that if I were

you."

It must be very lonely for her as she is. I
wonder when the wedding wil be. Last time
we gave her a pair of pink and gold candlesticks
"

"Did you?" said Frank. 'then don't do it
airain."

Why, no, of course not. Well, I inst think
about it."

If I were you, I'd wait till I knew there was
something to think about," said Frank drily, and
there was a silence, broken after a time by Mrs.
Leicester. "I've got an idea!" she announced.

Frank looked round rather impatiently, expecting
to hear of a wedding present. "I've been
thinking," said his mother, "wouldn't you like
me to ask her to come down again before her
marriage ? You would  wouldn't you ? "

He started. "1" he said.

"jSTo really?"

No," he repeated. " Why should she come ?
It was all very well for once, when you were
matchmaking, but I don't want to see Mrs. Austin
again."

"Eeally?" said Mrs. Leicester. "Well, you
surprise me  there's no making you out, Frank.
I knew you didn't like her at first, but at the end
of the time I thought you were just a little taken
with her "

Frank's answer was an impatient movement of
his shoulders,

Oh, I was wrong, I suppose," Mrs. Leicester
continued cheerfully, "but it was so. First I
thought you didn't like her, and then I didn't
know, and then I thought you did."

Well, you were right once," said Frank.

"Yes ; but it was very funny  I really thought
you did. I don't mean anything serious, of course,
but I thought, now, that if she had been a little

younger Or that you would take a fancy

one of these days to somebody younger, but that
style, you know."

Did you ? " he answered, with a laugh. " Then
you were wrong  quite wrong. I shall marry
some time or other, but my wife won't be the
least bit like Mrs. Austin."

Well, then, my dear boy, I'm sure it was very
nice of you to be so attentive just because she was
your mother's old friend. I hadn't the least idea
you disliked her as much as all that."

Disliked her  rubbish !" said Frank. "You're

always going from one extreme to the other." He
turned round and stood with his hands in his
pockets, and his head bent, staring so absently at
the fire that his mother said smilingly 

A penny for your thoughts ! Come, they
must be worth hearing ! "

Oh, I don't know," he began, rather sulkily ;
but all at once he laughed and looked up. " Here,
hand over that penny," he said ; " I was wondering
how long it took to get over the measles."

Mrs. Leicester was much amused at the absurd
idea, and gave him very precise information as
to the time which had elapsed in his own case
before his recovery was quite complete. "But
I don't know that it is the same with everybody,"
she said.

No, I daresay not," he replied a little vaguely.
"But I suppose a fellow always does get over
them some time or other, doesn't he ?"

There is a house in Lesborougli High Street, a
sketchy lath-and-plaster tenement, which looks
squeezed and uncomfortable between its more
substantial neighbours, like a bashful acquaintance
entangled in the rapturous greetings of two
old friends. It belongs to the Misses Fletcher,
who consider it a very desirable residence. They
ought to know it thoroughly, from the stuffy
parlour to the cheerless attics, for they have spent
all their lives in it, and they are no longer young.
But to outsiders it has a starved and dreary look ;
affording matter for curious speculation in the
likeness between the tall colourless building and

its owners. It hardly seems a fitting stage for any
drama. It is too undignified for tragedy, too unlovely
for brighter scenes. Yet within the last
thirty years it has held, perhaps, more than an
average share of doubt and despair, of hopes,
dreams, and surprises, not much better understood
by the Misses Fletcher than by the unconscious
walls.

One January afternoon, seven and twenty
years ago, the little parlour had two occupants.
Near the fireside sat a woman, who, reckoning by
years, should have been young, but who was
faded, hopeless, and worn out. Her hands lay
idly in her lap, and her eyes watched the slow
dropping of cinders on the hearth, or wandered
over the coloured vases and the elaborate arrangements
of shells which stood on the chimney-piece.
Once they lingered on an oil-painting of Mr.
Fletcher, Selina and Caroline's father, which hung
on the opposite wall, and, for that moment, something
of expression awoke within them. The
picture was too big for the room, and the worthy

ironmonger, for such lie had been during his lifetime,
seemed to prop the low ceiling with his
head, while he leaned forward as if to look into
his daughter-in-law's face. She stared defiantly
at his regular features, florid complexion, and
bland eternal smile, traced a likeness in brow and
eyes to his son, her husband, and her lip curled.
But her very hatred looked like querulous distaste.


Two years earlier she had run away from her
home with Henry Fletcher. She was an empty-headed
girl whose life had been made dreary by
poverty and family pride. The Vaughanss had
great relations but the smallest of incomes, and
Fanny's life was as rigidly ruled as if she were a
princess, and as narrow as if she were a nun. She
fancied herself in love with young Fletcher, and
she escaped from the tyranny of her mother and
brother to marry him. She had a vague idea that
her handsome Henry was in trade, but she thought
of something lucrative and general, of commerce
and merchant princes. She made so little attempt

VOL. XL G

to hide her disgust when she saw the Flamborough
shop, that there were bitter words between bridegroom
and bride within a week of their marriage.
And she had not been a month in her new home
before she learned that the death of her cousin
had made her brother a wealthy man, and that,
had she waited but those few weeks longer, her
brightest hopes might have been realised. She
bemoaned her impatient folly with lamentations
as foolish, which goaded her husband to outbursts
of fury.

It is needless to say that Fletcher never became
a merchant prince. He was extravagant; he
neglected his business, his foreman cheated him,
he took to billiards at the Red Lion, and went
headlong to bankruptcy. His wife sat at home,
crushed and listless, rousing herself only from
time to time to write letters to her brother Ernest.
She tried to make them eloquent and pathetic.
She felt that she failed, and said so with heavily-dropping
tears, which were in truth her nearest
approach to eloquence. But it made no difference.

The tear-blistered pleadings were returned unopened.
The crash had come, and while Henry
Fletcher went to London to seek employment, his
sisters took in Fanny and her year-old boy.
They did all they could to embitter this kindness
by their spiteful and miserly ways, and Fanny,
drooping by their fireside, irritated them by dull
indifference. She took no heed, though Selina
and Caroline were busy about the house, that
January afternoon. Once only she leaned forward
a little and listened, with a frown of vexation.
There was a faint sound like a far-off cry.

'Isn't your baby  it's a child in the street,"
said a rough boyish voice. And a repetition of
the sound proved the speaker to be right.

He was a lad of sixteen, who was at work with
books and papers near the window. Mr. Fletcher
had been twice married, and Theophilus was his
son by his second wife. He was a clumsy, broad-shouldered,
silent youth, who pored with lowering
brows over his arithmetic, and when he half-blundered,
half-swaggered into the room, seemed

to take an unaccountably large share of it. Thorpe,
as they called him, was always in the way.
Thorpe's elbows filled the table, and there was no
moving a step without falling over his legs. But
he seldom took any notice. When he did talk it
was in a loud voice, and he liked to impress upon
his hearers how much he despised gentlefolks,
what rubbish Greek and Latin were, and what a
good commercial education the boys got at Ms
school. He would have his mother's portion,
about eleven hundred pounds ; and, standing on
the rug with his legs well apart and his hands
thrust into his pockets, this big independent orphan
would sometimes discourse of the fortune he intended
to make. But as a rule he did his work,
and kept his day-dreams to himself.

It had not seemed probable that there would
be much sympathy between Thorpe and his sister-in-law.
But it soon became evident that in his
rough fashion he took a queer pitiful interest in
her, though she hardly appeared to heed it. She
made no answer when he spoke that afternoon,

but threw herself back in her chair, while he
resumed his work. Presently, however, she took a
paper from her pocket, read it through, and
turning a little as she sat, looked intently at the
lad's bent head. He raised it and their eyes met.
She rose, and moving with something of a pliant
grace, she crossed the room to where he sat.
Are you not going away tomorrow morning ? "
she said.

He nodded.

She laid the paper down. "Will you copy
this for me ? My brother is angry with me, and
when he sees my writing he won't open the letter.
But if you copy it he will begin it at any rate.
And then perhaps he will go on. And if he does
go on, I think  I hope "

Thorpe frowned, and pushed out a scornful
lower lip ; but he took a sheet of blue paper, and
with muttering of " What bosh ! " and " Pack of
rubbish ! " he copied the entreaties for a reconciliation
in a fine commercial hand. She wrote a
trembling " Fanny " at the end, folded the letter

as if her very soil were between the pages, and
slipped it into the lad's pocket with a beseeching-smile.
" Keep it till tomorrow," she said ; " he'll
not know the postmark then."

"All right. I'll post it."

"Don't forget it," she persisted, standing over
him while he twirled his pen in his big solid
fingers. She had one hand on his shoulder, and
the other lingered where she had put her treasure.
It's my last hope you have there by your
heart, Thorpe. Don't forget it."

/ won't forget it," he growled, shrugging up
his shoulder under her fingers. " Can't you trust
me?"

"Yes," she whispered, and stooping with sad
humility, the poor lady kissed his cheek. The
blood rushed to his forehead, but he put up his
hand and rubbed the place her lips had touched.

I say," he remonstrated, " I msh you'd leave
me alone. You make a fellow feel such a fool,
you know." And he blundered out of the room.

When he came again to Lesborough, Fanny's

hopes and fears were over. The big blue sheet of
paper had come back sealed with Ernest Vaughan's
signet-ring, and from that time she sank rapidly,
and seemed to have no desire to live. She took
no heed of her boy, and when her husband wished
for some kind of deathbed reconciliation, she turned
her face to the wall in petulant weariness, and
refused to make the slightest sign. Her brief life
was soon over, and her gravestone described her
as Henry Fletcher's beloved wife.

He did not long survive her. He lost his
situation, resolved to emigrate, and was drowned
on his voyage to Australia.

Selina and Caroline were left with the unwelcome
burden of their brother's child. Theophilus,
making his way in the world, ceased to come to
Lesborough. Time slipped away, and little Ernest
grew from baby to boy, from boy to youth, from
youth to man, till he was within three or four
months of his twenty-first birthday  a tall young
fellow, with beautiful eyes and a querulous mouth.
His life had been pent within that dreary house

and the attenuated strip of ground behind it.
This playground of his was a dull pathway leading
nowhere. Like Ernest himself, it seemed pent
and prisoned to the utmost limit of endurance ;
indeed almost beyond it, for at the end it bulged
out suddenly to the right, as if it had made a
desperate attempt to get away to the green fields.
But it had been thwarted ; cut off by a dusty
lane, shouldered aside by a neighbouring stable,
and the only result of the effort was an excrescence,
holding two stunted lime-trees and some feeble
boughs of lilac. A few wallflowers and Canterbury
bells forced their way through the hardened soil,
and at intervals down the narrow borders were
dotted dreary little bushes, sprinkled every autumn
with minute and melancholy Michaelmas daisies.
This strip of ground was called "the garden," a
comprehensive word, since it could designate Eden
and this.

As a child Ernest had played in the corner
which was safe from prying eyes. As a youth he
haunted it still. He was sullen and shy, but

there was something of grace about the lad,
slender and eager-eyed, who dreamed over books
and papers in his garret, or went with swift strides
along the garden path. Most of all was that grace
about him, when, reaching the lime-trees, he leant
against the wall with folded arms and lifted face.
For then at a window high in a roof across the

lane would be seen ISTo matter, Ernest knew,

and the Misses Fletcher did not, and perhaps there
might be a touch of Eden about the grim little
enclosure after all.

Time had awakened no kindlier feelings in the
sisters' hearts. Miss Fletcher was fifty-eight,
Miss Caroline was fifty-five. Their days were
spent in the practice of small economies, enlivened
by spiteful gossip. Year after year dawned on
them in their unlovely existence, and left them
exactly as it found them, except that they were
the older by its age, leading such a life, so gray,
so cramped, so unutterably mean, that the mere
thought of it would overshadow young hearts with
a horror worse than the horror of the grave.

What had they to do with the dream which made
that garden corner so fair to Ernest's eyes ?

Just at this time he had leisure enough to lean
and look, for his work in life was not yet found.
He had been educated at the Lesborough Grammar
School, and ]mr. Markham, the master  a dreamy
man, clever in a whimsical way, but curiously
unfitted for the post he held  took a fancy to him,
and kept him at a small salary to teach the younger
boys. Ernest had no aptitude for the work, but
he liked to be with Mr. Markham. So he drifted
on till the master's sudden death left him stranded
and helpless. What could he do ? The Misses
Fletcher made inquiries, and offered him a place
in a draper's shop. He said he would starve
sooner. They persisted, partly because they
thought it really suitable, and partly because
they found something spitefully charming in the
idea of Fanny's boy behind a counter, when Fanny
herself had so loathed her husband's shop. Sure
of the triumph  for what could Ernest do but
yield?  they gave him a fortnight to think it

over, and see what he could find for himself; but
the fortnight was slipping away, and he had done
nothing. The thought of enlisting crossed his
mind, but the remembrance of Lizzie Grey held
him back  Lizzie whom he loved ; beautiful
Lizzie who loved him.

Day after day, as she came from teaching the
children of a Lesborough grocer, she opened the
little window, by which a poplar flickered, and
saw her lover's lifted face as he watched for herby
the lac-bush below. Young as they were, it
seemed to them that they had loved for a lifetime,
since neither could say when it began, and neither
had so much as dreamed of any other.

Lizzie was very pretty. She was a tall, sight
girl, with a wide forehead, wavy brown hair, soft
red lips that were ready to smile, and eyes that
were clear and true. It was easy to see that she was
quick and self-reliant ; in fact, Ernest leant on her
rather than she on him. She was gently tolerant
of his wayward melancholy and his jealous follies,
but his day-dreams pained her a little sometimes.

She could help him when he was despondent, but
she felt as if she hardly understood the castles in
the air which he would build on a hopeful day.
Perhaps in her frank humility she thought his
ambition nobler than it was. As for Ernest, he
did not doubt for a moment that her desires were
the same as his own.

It had been easy to deceive Selina and Caroline
in the matter of his love. They would often ask
Lizzie to tea, because she was a capital amateur
dressmaker, and had ingenious ideas which would
make their frayed and faded garments look as
good as new. On these occasions Ernest would
wear a lowering face, for he hated to see his love
stooping over Selina's dingy finery, planning and
turning, with pins in her mouth. But his aunts
misunderstood his ill temper, and chose to imagine
that he despised Lizzie Grey, because her father,
dead some three years earlier, had been only a
superintendent of police. They lectured him on
his sinful pride, and he heard them in sullen
scorn. Consequently they would summon him to

render her small services, to hold a candle, or
bring a footstool, or take her cup. He obeyed in
silence, and while they exchanged triumphant
glances, he rejoiced in the exquisite moments
when his eyes or hands met Lizzie's.

Ernest's final decision was to be made on the
fifth of February. The weather had been very
mild, but it changed on the night of the first, and
a black and bitter frost turned the earth to
adamant beneath a leaden sky. The intolerable
cold drove him from his garret, and he was
miserable for himself and for his one pet. This
pet was an old and hideous sandy cat, toothless,
lame, and a very miracle of leanness, such a cat as
one might see in a nightmare, but hardly anywhere
else. Ernest loved it because one day he
rescued it from some boys, who were stoning the
helpless vindictive beast in a corner. The poor
brute would follow him trustfully, rubbing itself
against him as he walked in the garden. He
never spoke of it, but he pilfered bits of meat for
it; he crept downstairs and stole the milk, preserving

a guilty silence when the milkman's
character was aspersed in consequence. He was
absolutely sick with fear lest Dorcas, the surface
maid, should catch him thieving. But
what could he do ? Even had he had money to
spare he could not have bought meat and milk
for Sandy without exciting suspicion. Already
his aunts wondered why " that horrid cat " was so
often about the place, and Miss Selina or Miss
Caroline, perceiving it, would fly out with " Sh 
you nasty beast  you!" or Dorcas would pursue
it with a shower of small stones, and the hunted
wretch would scramble over the wall, turning at a
safe distance to spit and growl in venomous
impotence like a decrepit fiend. Ernest meanwhile
stood by, fully aware of his favourite's
repulsive appearance, but with disgust swallowed
up in pity for its bleak and starved existence.
Still he was sore, not because Sandy was ugly and
malignant, but because he fancied it was ridiculous
to protect an old cat. " It was his usual luck,"
he grumbled to himself. Had it been a dog there

would have been nothing laughable about it, but
he was ashamed of pussy scuttling over the tiles.
Yet he was very true to Sandy. Spending the
evening with Mr. Markham, in his happier days,
he had more than once refused to stay the night,
only because the weather was wild and cold, and
he could not bear to think of Sandy mewing the
long hours through, and rubbing its lean body
against the window of his empty room.

And what was Sandy doing in this bitter frost ?
Ernest wondered as he sat in the parlour with the
local paper in his hand. He wondered, too, why
his Aunt Selina's thimble and needle clicked at
every stitch she took, while his Aunt Caroline's
didn't. Only Aunt Caroline had a trick of sniffing
at irregular intervals, and Ernest was not quite
certain whether the regular click of thimble and
needle, though it worried him almost to distraction,
was worse than the horrible suspense caused by
the irregularity of Aunt Caroline's sniffing. The
two combined were maddening, Last time he
counted nineteen clicks and then a sniff; this

time lie had got to seven and twenty  ah ! thank
goodness, there it was ! Yet why thank goodness ?
For one, two, three, four, when would the next be ?
He muttered something under his breath, and
felt that a man might do murder for less cause.

"What did you say?" Aunt Caroline inquired.


I didn't speak," said Ernest, staring at a string
of dreary little paragraphs.

Oh 1 I leg your pardon ! Singular that my
ears should have so deceived me." And Aunt
Caroline resumed her stitching with a sniff. The
young man leapt to his feet and crumpled up the
paper. He felt that he could not endure the stuffy
little room, the stale Lesborough news, and Selina
and Caroline, one moment longer, and he hurried
away to face the rough east wind. He battled
against it with angry pleasure till he was tired
out, and the gathering dusk drove him home, to
take up all his burdens again at the first glimpse
of that white house which he hated. But no
sooner had he crossed the threshold than he was

conscious of an unwonted presence within. A
small portmanteau lay at the foot of the stairs,
and an overcoat, which smelt of smoke, was tossed
across a chair. The Misses Fletcher abhorred
smokers. From the parlour came a voice, masculine
in depth and power, and pleasant after the
sisters' shrillness.

Ernest's eyes were bright with a scarcely
acknowledged hope as he pushed the door open
and went in. A big fair man stood on the rug,
his head thrown back with a defiant air. His
hands were thrust into his pockets, perhaps as a
judicious economy of space in the little room.
Selina and Caroline, surely leaner and more
wizened than when Ernest went out that afternoon,
sat squeezed against opposite walls, with their
heads on one side, like mediaeval saints in a stained
window, and gazed admiringly at the stranger.
There was a pause, while young Fletcher stared
at the queer group, till the broad-shouldered
central figure stepped forward. '' So this is the
boy ?" he said, with a glance right and left. And

VOL. II. H

the pair of meagre supporters exclaimed in a
breath, "Your Uncle Theophilus !"

The light died out of Ernest's eyes when he
perceived that the newcomer was not a Vaughan.
He drew himself up to his full height, and bowed
in silence. But Theophilus with a laugh ignored
the stately bow and held out his hand, while his
quick gray-blue eyes scanned the lad's face. " So
you are Ernest ? " he said. " You were baby when
I saw you last  you show one how the time has
slipped away."

"Yes, I'm Ernest," and the young man gave
his hand an impatient little twist. His uncle
dropped it with an amused smile, and turning to
Selina said, " He's Eke poor Harry."

Oh, do you think so ? " she replied with
charming candour. "Why, Henry was so good-looking?"
Thorpe laughed again as he looked at
Ms nephew.

Ernest felt that he hated this man. Yet Theophilus
Fletcher was far from ill-looking. He had
lost the awkwardness of old days, he carried

himself well, and his face, though not distinguished
for refinement, might be called handsome. There
was perhaps something stubborn and heavy about
the lower part of it, but his smile was pleasant,
and frequent too, for his former sullenness had
been not so much ill-temper as an uncouth manner.
Except that Mr. Fletcher was a little inclined to
be stout, and that the strong auburn hair was
slightly wearing off his broad forehead, the change
in him was one of unmixed improvement. Yet
to Ernest a fiend in human shape could hardly
have been so distasteful as this sleek, shrewd, self-satisfied
man. For Theophilus Fletcher had
attained his boyish ideal ; he was eminently
commercial.

The little maidservant who helped Dorcas
came in with a note. Miss Selina read it with
an air of mystery, nodded to Miss Caroline, and
went out. Ernest, going wearily upstairs, met
her, and was informed that Miss Grey was coming
to tea. He stopped short, and his angry scowl
might well confirm her in the idea that he disliked

Lizzie. " Have you any objection, pray ?"
she inquired.

"What does it matter?" he said in a half-choked
voice. He brushed past her, and raced
upstairs, furious at the thought that Lizzie  his
Lizzie  should have been sent for to amuse a
vulgar tradesman. He dashed into his room,
scaring poor Sandy, who had crept in at the window
and was crouching in a corner. His frenzy
was over in a moment, and he caught up his
favourite, fondling it with a patient tenderness.
Lizzie would have liked to see the smile which
lighted his dark face, and glanced, like sunshine
on sullen waters, from his melancholy eyes. He
was unwilling to put Sandy down. And why
should he ? He was not going to take any trouble
to do honour to Theophilus Fletcher. So when
at last he saw fit to go downstairs he had done
little to improve his personal appearance.

Not so the other. Whether on account of the
coming visitor, or merely from his habit of
neglecting no advantage which he might possess,

Mr. Theophilus Fletcher had dressed very carefully
indeed. Ernest, lounging in in his shabby
morning coat, found his uncle looking very new
and resplendent, and occupying his favourite position
on the rug, while Miss Selina, in her Sunday
cap, chattered about Lizzie Grey.

A really charming girl, Theophilus ; so pretty,
and so unaffected  oh, you needn't look at Ernest
Ernest doesn't like her  her father was only a
superintendent of police  very well for lis, but
not nearly grand enough for him, is she, Ernest ?
A duchess might do perhaps  he! he!  but a
superintendent of police's daughter !  oh clear no ! "

"No?" said Thorpe. "What, won't she have
anything to say to you, my boy? When it's a
question of a pretty girl nobody looks so savage
for nothing, let her father be what he may. What
has this pretty Miss Lizzie done to you ?"

Ernest's frown grew darker. " I don't know
what you mean, sir, and I don't know what
my aunt means. I don't find fault with Miss
Grey."

The bell rang, and Selina flew out to welcome
her guest.

"Nonsense, man, I was only in joke," said
Thorpe. " You've lived with these solemn sisters
of mine till you don't know what a joke is  and
till you've taken to nursing their cats, I declare !"

His strong hand was on his nephew's shoulder,
and he turned him round as he spoke. Ernest
looked down and saw poor pussy's sandy hairs
sprinkled thickly on his coat. "You are just the
young man to live with a couple of spinsters,
aren't you?" said Thorpe.

A step was heard in the passage, and for the
first time Ernest voluntarily met his uncle's eyes.

"Don't say anything, sir  they hate the poor
brute. They'd hunt it "

"Then be off and brush your coat," said the
other. " Their eyes mayn't be as sharp as mine 
Caroline ought to wear spectacles, / know  but
never count on a woman's not seeing what she
isn't meant to see  mind that."

Thorpe, left to himself, wondered why his

nephew should dislike Lizzie Grey. " Cooped up
here with Selina and Caroline, he ought to be
ready to like anybody. And what should a pretty
girl come here for unless she likes the boy ? No,
no, either she is fearfully plain, in which case
the women will swear she is charming, as a matter
of course, or  which I strongly suspect  Master
Ernest and Miss Lizzie are a pair of sly young
hypocrites, and have hoodwinked the old ladies.
We'll see."

And he did see how, when the young folks
greeted each other with unmoved faces, their
hands lingered for a moment as if unwilling to
part. " Sly fellow," said Thorpe to himself. " He
doesn't find fault with her  no, I daresay not. I
wouldn't find fault with Miss Lizzie if she held
my hand like that!"

The tea-party was a very cheerful one to all
but Ernest. Even the sisters contributed what
little they could, though it was of a feeble and
acidulated kind, to the merriment. Thorpe tried
to draw his nephew into the conversation, but,

being peevishly repulsed, he turned away with a
smile, and devoted himself to Miss Grey. Ernest
looked on in angry astonishment. If it were
intolerable that Lizzie should be sent for to amuse
a bullying overdressed tradesman, how infinitely
worse to find her unconscious of her degradation !
Poor Lizzie ! She liked Mr. Fletcher, and had
no idea that she ought to feel humiliated. She
glanced at her lover from time to time as he sat
apart, and thought that he looked like a prince in
disguise; but she was forced to own that her
prince was slovenly, out at elbows, moody, and
deficient in princely courtesy. Why did he
repulse his uncle ? Why should not his life be
brightened by the broad glow of Mr. Fletcher's
prosperity? And on Ernest's behalf she paid
her innocent court to Theophilus.

Miss Caroline's spirits rose to such an unusual
height that, when the table was cleared, she proposed
to play cribbage with her brother, as she
used to do with the schoolboy of twenty years
earlier. Thorpe assented, but when the cards

were produced, he could not refrain from a startled
aside  " Same pack, by Jove !"  and for a moment
his brow was drawn down, and his under lip pushed
out as of old. This man had no reverence for
antiquity, and took no interest in the memorials
of bygone centuries. But he was strangely impressed
by the accidental permanence of so
perishable a thing as a pack of cards, and he casta
pitying glance at his sisters. His views of
woman's rights and woman's needs were narrow
enough. A woman should have a husband who
would never loose his temper nor his authority,
and who should provide her with a comfortable
home, plenty to eat and drink, and a sufficiency
of finery. But, as he shuffled the old cards, he
woke to a sudden comprehension of the stagnant
dreariness of his sisters' lives. Twenty years
earlier he had left that house to work his way to
fortune. He had known many changes and many
men. He had thrown himself, rejoicing in his
strength, into the world's swift current, and was
hurrying onward to success. And when he came

back to his old home he found no change there,
except that of inevitable decay, and no idea of
amusement for the man except the pack of cards
with which the boy had played. But Caroline
was waiting for him to begin, and he had no time
for further thought.

Apparently he had not become more skilful
since their former encounters, and he soon leant
back to show his cards to Miss Grey, as she sat
by the fireside. While he dexterously balanced
himself so as to bring his bold face and mirthful
eyes very close to Lizzie, that she might give her
counsel in a whisper, Ernest felt that he would
cheerfully give all that he possessed  not much,
poor fellow!  to see the tilted chair slip, and
tumble the self-possessed gentleman into the
fender among the fire-irons. But it was not
to be. And as Mr. Fletcher made outrageous
blunders if left to himself for a moment, and Miss
Caroline said, in a tone which was meant to be
playful, " I looncUr you don't look after your
pupil better than that, Lizzie, I do indeed," the

girl, after a little while, drew her chair to the
table, laid aside her work, and gave herself up to
the genie. She had enough to do, for Theophilus
cheated unblushingly before his adversary's very
eyes, and looked so coolly at Lizzie herself when
he had rattled off, and was about to score, some
astonishing miscalculation of his hand, that she
could only reply with a glance of incredulous
doubt, and, taking the cards from him, endeavour
to point out his mistakes. But once in the midst
of the demonstration she was suddenly aware of
laughter lurking in his eyes, and, flinging down
the cards she exclaimed, " I won't say another
word  you know it all better than I do, and you
cheat most abominably, Mr. Fletcher." But
Thorpe explained how the truth had just dawned
upon him, and he could not help laughing at his
own stupidity. Lizzie shook her head, but at last
she relented, and looked at the hand which had
just been dealt to him.

Presently Miss Selina hunted a black bottle of
currant wine out of the cupboard, and called for a

corkscrew. Thorpe begged her not to open it on
his account, as brandy and water would do for
him. She however persisted, and hospitably
poured it out. Even then, though he was assured
that, being opened, it might as well be drunk, he
steadily declined it, declaring that when he said a
thing he meant it, and that brandy and water
would be quite good enough for him.

Shall I see you home. Miss Grey ?" he asked,
when Lizzie, having finished her glass of wine,
was folding up her work. " I don't know the way
of course, but if it isn't very difficult, we might
walk it two or three times, and I daresay I could
learn it."

Oh, Ernest shall go with Lizzie," Miss
Caroline exclaimed. "It's only a step  don't
you remember the white house across the
lane ? "

Thorpe did remember.

I wouldn't have your escort for the world,"
said Lizzie gaily, as she bade him good-night. " I
should be afraid that you might forget after all.

and wander about Lesborough all night, and be
found dead of cold."

Like a Babe in the Wood ? " he suggested.

Worse  no leaves this time of year ! "

Take a good many to cover me at the best of
times, wouldn't it?" said Theophilus. As he
spoke Selina appeared with the brandy bottle,
inquiring if Lizzie was ready, and as Ernest was
visible, gloomily waiting in the background, the
girl went off in haste.

She had but a moody companion. He abused
Thorpe Fletcher's appearance, manners, coat, ring,
and Albert chain, until they reached her door.
"How we have wasted our time!" said Lizzie
sadly, " and I have so little time with you,
Ernest."

"Let us go a little farther," he pleaded in
sudden penitence.

She shook her head. " They will notice how
long you are. We mustn't run any risks."

He hesitated, but he knew that she was right.
Glancing along the deserted lane, he took her

hands in his. "Forgive me," he said. She
smiled in answer, and, stooping, he kissed her
fondly. Lizzie will remember that kiss to her
dying day  the eager beautiful eyes which looked
down into hers, the lips and hands which clung
as if they would never part, and overhead the
keen stars twinkling through the frosty air.

Theophilus briefly informed his sisters that he
had come on a matter of business, and should stay
some little time. He did not inform them that it
was very possible that Lesborough might once
more become his home. There was a large
foundry about a mile and a half from the town,
and he had learned that its owner was anxious to
retire from business. He thought that he saw a
much-desired opportunity for carrying out some
improvements in thrashing-machines and steam-ploughs
; and though he would not have suffered
any foolish sentiment to affect his plans, he was
glad that his opening should be at Lesborough.
Nowhere else could he so accurately measure the
height which he had reached.

As the days went by his prolonged stay became
a source of perplexity to Lizzie Grey. She knew
nothing about the business which detained him,
but even had all the negotiations about the
foundry been fully explained to her, she might
not have understood why it was needful for Mr.
Fletcher to haunt the High Street, day after day,
just when she went to and from her teaching.
Why did he watch her with such keen curiosity ?
And why did he try to conceal this curiosity
under an affectation of carelessness, which apparently
deceived others, though it could not
deceive her ? She was absolutely certain that he
listened intently to every syllable she uttered,
still with that same assumption of indifference.
At times he would be moody and preoccupied, but
Lizzie knew that he was preoccupied with thoughts
of her. Before he had been in Lesborough ten
days she was thoroughly alarmed and confused.
The High Street was full of Theophilus Fletcher,
and she fled through it with the hurried steps and
throbbing pulses of a hunted creature.

It was her solution of the mystery which
frightened her. There are some girls who fancy
that every man they meet is dying for them.
Lizzie was not one of these, but she did believe
that Mr. Fletcher was in love with her. The very
idea was terrible, and sent a flood of crimson to
her cheeks ; yet what else could she think ? How
otherwise could she account for his pursuit of her,
for the questioning glances which sought an answer
in her face ? More than once speech seemed so
imminent that Lizzie held her breath in terror,
and thought it miraculous that Ernest's suspicion
had not as yet been aroused. Any moment might
open his eyes, and concentrate his hatred on the
man she had fondly hoped would be his benefactor.
In fact his eyes must be opened before long, for
even while she tried to keep Theophilus at arm's
length, to avoid his glance, the touch of his hand, or
to escape when she saw him coming, she felt as if
she were knotting cobweb fetters to restrain some
great thick-skinned animal, who would be unconscious
of any bond. Not for one moment could

VOL. II. I

she hold him in check when he should decide that
the time had come. And when she had rejected
him everything would come out, and Ernest's
prospects would be rained.

It was quite true that Mr. Fletcher had an
interest in Lesborough besides the foundry. He
had come to see what he could do for poor Fanny's
boy. He said nothing of this to his sisters, who
would never have understood his feelings towards
Ms brother's wife. He hardly understood them
himself. He had thought her a limp, faded,
foolish woman ; he had seen no beauty in her, and
yet she had awakened in his heart a pity in which
scorn and kindness were curiously mixed ; a contemptuous
fidelity which lived when she was
dead. Prosperous and practical though he was,
there were times when he could almost have
fancied that he felt those fingers, cold and dead a
score of years, fluttering again at his heart, where
once her letter lay. He scorned idle sentiment,
which achieved nothing, but spent itself in vain
regrets. Yet he, of all men, was guilty of this

contemptible folly, since he could not forget his
useless pity. But might not its existence be justified
to himself, if, for its sake, he helped Ernest ?
He owned grimly that he did not think Fanny
had cared much about her boy, but he supposed
she might be different in Heaven. (Thorpe
inclined to the belief that all women went to
Heaven unless they were absolutely lad.) Let
that be as it might, it was his only chance of
doing anything for Fanny, and he took possession
of the young fellow with a benignantly despotic
smile. His determination was only strengthened
by the scowling glances and sullen words with
which his advances were met. But he had not to
deal with Ernest alone. On the threshold of
every scheme for his nephew's good, he encountered
an unlooked-for difficulty. How should he attack
it? He waited awhile, and tried to understand
Lizzie Grey. Then swiftly his mind was made up,
he snatched the earliest opportunity of action, and
Lizzie found herself face to face with the moment
she had dreaded.

It happened thus. She arrived early one
afternoon at Mrs. Croft's, flushed with the
excitement of having caught but a distant
glimpse of Mr. Fletcher on her way. She was
received with the news of a holiday for her little
scholars, their grand mamma having come unexpectedly
and taken them out. Mrs. Croft, however,
had no idea of losing Lizzie's services, and
asked her if she would mind walking to a farmhouse
about three miles off to give a message
about some butter. ~No one could be spared to go,
and if Miss Grey had no objection, as there were
no lessons

Miss Grey agreed at once, delighted to exchange
the little schoolroom, which smelt of cheese, for
the lonely road to Firewood Grange. In less than
five minutes she was on her way.

She grows prettier every day," said Mrs.
Croft, looking after her.

"No need," said the grocer from behind his
counter. " Prettiest girl in Lesborough now."

Mrs. Croft was right. Lizzie's face had been

almost too placid, and the anxiety which might
have made another look harassed and worn had
only given her the charm of swift glances and
varying expression. The prettiest girl in Les-borough
had never looked prettier than when she
started on her walk that afternoon.

It was an hour and a half later, and the
February day, losing its brief gleam of mid-day
gold, had grown chill and pale. Lizzie had successfully
accomplished her errand, and was just
starting on her homeward walk. She looked back
as she closed the little garden-gate, nodded a
bright farewell to the farmer's wife, and turned
into the road by a little plantation of stunted firs,
duskily green amid the general leaflessness. She
had a half-smile on her lips, for she was thinking
how pleasant it would be if by a happy chance
she should meet Ernest on her way, when a
man who was lounging by a roadside gate, cigar
in mouth, stepped forward and confronted her.
With a sudden throb she recognised Theophilus
Fletcher, and for a moment she halted ; but escape

was impossible, and she greeted him as calmly as
she could.

"How d'ye do?" he said, removing his cigar.
"Did I startle you?"

A little," said Lizzie, trying to smile.

I'm very sorry. But what a time you have
been ! I began almost to think you had gone by
the fields."

Lizzie, thunderstruck, devoutly wished she had.
"How did you know I was coming at all?" she
asked.

He laughed. " Oh, I pick up some bits of
useful knowledge about the town now and then.
Croft told me."

Lizzie, quickening her pace, kept silence, with
a desperate glance right and left, and ever the
same consciousness of his eyes upon her.

In a hurry ?" said Thorpe.

Oh yes ! Yes, I mean, I am rather in a
hurry."

"We'll walk a little faster, if you like," he
replied, with thoughtful consideration. "You

can't tire me." But Lizzie felt a despairing
conviction of the truth of his words, and knew
that any increase of speed was out of the
question.

"Why, you're out of breath already!" he said
after a moment. "I say, what's the good of
racing like that ? I want to talk to you."

"You want to talk to me?" she repeated
faintly.

Yes, I've something to say to you. What on
earth do you think I came all this way for ? "

It was coming, then ! For one horrible moment
the ground seemed to slip from under her feet,
and the leafless trees to reel and sway. " I'm sure
I don't know," she said.

Thorpe suddenly turned upon her. " What is
the matter with you, Miss Grey ?"

Nothing," was the almost inaudible reply.

I suppose you think I haven't got any eyes ?"
he said. It was the last thing Lizzie could think
when she could hardly endure them upon her.
I know better. Something is the matter. Anybody

been bullying you ? Governesses always
are bullied  aren't they ?"

No," said Lizzie. " Never mind me. Nothing
is the matter."

That means that something is wrong, but it's
no business of mine. Well, you're about right
there, I suppose. Only, you see, I came because
I wanted a quiet talk, and how am I to have it if
you can't look at me, and won't speak to me ?"

Lizzie, nerved with the courage of despair,
suddenly stopped, lifted her eyes, and looked him
steadily in the face.

I don't know what you can possibly have to
talk to me about, Mr. Fletcher, but I'll listen if
you'll say it."

And take myself off as soon as I've done, eh ?
That's what you mean, isn't it ? I say, I'm mismanaging
this frightfully somehow. I never know
how to make women understand things. I wanted
you to be particularly good-tempered, and here
I've half-offended you to begin with, and I haven't
a notion how, upon my word I haven't."

I am not offended," said Lizzie impatiently.
If there is anything you must say, say it."

He jerked the end of his cigar over the hedge,
and pushed out his lower lip. "It's a difficult
subject," he began, after a pause. " I lay awake
half last night, trying to see what was best to do,
and I made up my mind to have it out with you.
I thought you were a sensible sort of girl, and I
hoped you would take it as I meant it, though I
am rather a stranger."

"Well?" said Lizzie desperately.

It's about Ernest," said Mr. Fletcher.

She started. " About Ernest ! What about
him?"

"Why, you young people have hoodwinked
my sisters, but I can put two and two together 
at least," with a knowing twinkle in his eyes, " it's
enough to put one and one together in this case,
isn't it, Miss Grey ? and I can see pretty well how
the land lies, can't I ? You needn't be afraid  I
don't tell tales c?iY I?"

Lizzie laughed and blushed, hanging her head.

"I suppose you cau," she said at last, speaking
naturally and sweetly for the first time

I say," Thorpe exclaimed, with a sudden light
of amused intelligence dawning on his face, " what
did you think I was going to say that made you
so fierce and cold just now  eh ? Didn't think I
wanted to poach a little on Ernest's manor on my
own account, did you?"

Don't, please ! I don't know what I did
think," said Lizzie, crimsoning in her intense
anxiety not to blush.

He looked at her, and then laughed, not unkindly,
except so far as any laughter was unkind.
A way out of the difficulty which didn't occur tome,"
he said to himself, and smiled a little as he
walked.

They went a few steps in silence. " Look
here," said Theophilus suddenly. The tone was
so abrupt and imperious that Lizzie obeyed him
literally, looked up, and instantly forgot her
burning cheeks. The Thorpe of a moment earlier,
who had chuckled to himself over her confusion,

was all at once transformed, and it flashed upon
Lizzie as she looked at him that he could be very
hard.

Look here," he said. " I came here to do a
disagreeable thing, and I'm going to do it, and get
it over. I don't like it, you understand. It was
a good deal pleasant talking nonsense to you a
minute ago." Lizzie, though puzzled and a little
frightened, wondered what could be less pleasant
than the ordeal through which she had just
passed. " But of course that makes no difference,"
he added, " and the sooner it's said the better."

I haven't the slightest idea of your meaning,"
said Lizzie.

"Did you expect to guess it beforehand?" he
demanded. " Now, Miss Grey, you and that boy
have been making love over there"  (a nod
indicated Lesborough in the distance). " I don't
blame you, mind, it's natural enough. And I
don't blame him, he had nothing else to do. In
fact," he went on, gliding into a sort of monologue,
I could hardly have blamed him if he had done

much worse. I ought to have looked after him
long ago."

Lizzie objected to this view of her life's
romance, and was opening her lips to speak some
rather vehement words, but Theophilus came
suddenly to the point. "I don't blame you, I
say," he repeated, raising his voice, and looking
directly in her face. 'but I want you to give
him up."

Give him up 1" cried Lizzie, wonder and scorn
in her wide clear eyes. " Give him up ! " She
glanced incredulously at Fletcher, and laughed
aloud ; she could not help it.

There was not the faintest movement of his
face, not the least change in his look. One would
have said he had not so much as heard that involuntary
defiance. Lizzie stopped abruptly,
with a hurried glance over her shoulder, as if
some ghostly echo of her own laughter rang in
the air and mocked her.

"I want you to give him up," Theophilus
repeated in precisely the same tone. " Twenty

years ago I saw a woman die of a broken heart in
the house where I met you first."

His mother ?" said Lizzie.

Thorpe nodded. His eyes wandered from her
face across the desolate fields. " She used to sit
by the fire where you sat that night. She didn't
talk much, but she had a look in her eyes that
would make your heart ache. My sisters don't
mean to be unkind, I suppose, but if there were a
prize for aggravation they'd get it, you know.
(Not if they knew I'd backed them, though.
Then they wouldn't unless somebody found them
out.) They used to worry poor Fanny, and I
couldn't help her, but I said to myself that if ever
I could help the boy I would. For her sake, not
for his  wretched little baby he was, to be sure !"

Lizzie looked gratitude, defiance, and disgust.

I did not forget him, though I put off coming,"
Thorpe went on. "I ought to have been here
before this. The lad is getting his mother's
horrible, hopeless look ; he'll go mad, or cut his
throat, among the lot of you before all's done."

Lizzie shuddered. " No ! no ! " she cried,
He is very unhappy, I know, but it is not so bad
as that!"

You mean to take care of him, eh ? Well, I
daresay you could reconcile him to a good deal.
But how about the pounds, shillings, and pence,
Miss Grey ? When will Ernest earn enough for
you to live on?"

I don't know," was her reluctant admission.

Nor I. Chances don't always come to those
who are ready to seize them, and Ernest would
stand and hesitate ever so long before he could
make up his fastidious mind. But say he gets
something to do  what then ? Would he be
happy, drudging all his life for mere bread, even
with you by his side ?"

He touched the painful doubt which lurked,
almost unacknowledged, in the girl's heart.
Ernest's love was enough for her, but was hers
enough for Ernest ?

He'll never make his fortune," said Theophilus.
Strange how different men are, isn't it ? If anyone

came to me and said, ' You'll never make a
fortune, you are only fit to spend one,' I should feel
insulted. Ernest would take it as a compliment."

Very well," said Lizzie. " Suppose lie doesn't
make his fortune. I'm not afraid of being poor."

"Just as I thought," in a tone of patronage.
You are a couple of foolish young people, benton
ruining each other. Now I won't be a party
to it. I might help him up the ladder by himself.
That would be quite enough to do, for I couldn't
know less what to say to him or make of him if
he were a  a  a bishop in lawn sleeves ! But as
to helping him with a wife "

"Mr. Fletcher," this very fiercely, "I don't
want any of your help !"

But, my good girl, how can I help him without
helping you if this is to go on ? Say I make
him a clerk at the foundry. Won't he want to
marry as soon as he has a hundred a year?"

Ernest had many a time talked of that sum.

Say that I send him to college, and make a
parson of him "

Oh, if you would ! " she cried.

Won't he ask you to starve with him as soon
as he has a curacy ? And won't he be in difficulties
to the day of his death ? I won't have it. Where
should I have been if I had married at his
age?"

Why don't you speak to him, Mr. Fletcher ?
I'll set him free in a minute if he likes."

"Speak to the Man in the Moon !" said Theophilus.
" Now isn't that like a woman's speech 
sounds all right and fair, and not a grain of sense
when you come to look at it. Speak to him ! 
why, of course, instead of marrying on a hundred
a year, he'd want to do it tomorrow on nothing,
just to defy me. Speak to him if you like  you
know as well as I do what will be the end of
that. You will be very noble and self-sacrificing,
he will be devoted and indignant, and I shall get
my answer. The boy's as proud as Lucifer, and
thinks me a vulgar tradesman. I don't see," said
Thorpe, in a studiously mild voice, fixing his eyes
as he spoke on a clump of brambles a little farther

on, "I really don't see that I am bound to ash
him to throw my own money in my face."

This was unanswerable, especially as Lizzie
knew that every syllable was perfectly true. She
could imagine the defiant scorn with which Ernest
would receive his kinsman. They came to the
brambles at which Thorpe had been looking, and
he struck out suddenly and savagely at them with
his stick.

"But," cried the girl, looking up at the
stubborn features which contrasted strangely with
her blanched and quivering face, " do you know
what you are asking me to do ? ISTot only to give
him up  to give Ernest up !  but to let him think
me false,  to cast him off now that he is poor, for
he must not know that the good fortune is coming,
and that I am paying the price, or he will not take
it. Oh, you cannot know what you are doing !"

Thorpe just opened his lips, let out " I know,"
and shut them closer than ever.

Then I can't," cried Lizzie desperately. " It's
too much. I can't. Mr. Fletcher, I can't !"

VOL. II. K

'every well," lie said. "That's settled then.
You aren't angry with me for having asked you,
I hope?"

His promptitude dismayed her. " ISTo  stop ! "
she exclaimed. "Did I say I couldn't? But I
can't ruin Ernest  let me try to think a moment !
Mr. Fletcher, you must give me time ! "

As long as you please." He did not like his
task ; but his pity only pained him, it could not
change his resolution. He had an unforeseen
feeling that he was behaving like a brute to the
girl at his side. What then ? He was conscious
at the same time of a certain brute-strength and
tenacity which showed no symptom of failing
him.

They were slowly ascending some rising
ground, and the wintry landscape widened round
them. Theophilus scarcely saw it, but Lizzie's
eyes swept the sad horizon, and something of its
hopeless calm rose in her soul as she looked on
the dying of that gray and bitter day. Still the
lips which so short a time before knew Ernest's

good-night kiss were forced, by virtue of that
touch, to plead for the love of which it was the
sign. Yet there was a melancholy patience in her
voice which made the very struggle a surrender.

Mr. Fletcher."

He nodded.

Must it be for always ? If we waited a long,
long time  years and years "

Theophilus trod out the little spark of hope.
Have those appealing eyes to ha ant him for ever?
Lengthen this painful half hour to a lifetime?
"No!" he said aloud. "Do you think Ernest
would agree to wait for my consent? Besides,"
he added after a pause, " I have a fancy that perhaps
one day the Vaughanss may acknowledge the
lad, and give him a helping hand. I hate his
uncle myself, a fellow who could let his sister
pine away for want of a kind word ! But these
Vaughanss  for Ernest is one  are not happy with
us, and we had better part company. Only for
such a flight as that the boy must go free."

Another silence. "No offence to you," said

Theophilus. "You're a good girl, I'm sure, and
you're clever and pretty  uncommonly pretty.
I will say that for you "  (he had the grace to say
it in a sort of aside)  " and the Vaughan would
turn up their noses at you, as if you were dirt
under their feet. If you waited for years it must
come to the same end. Ernest must quarrel with
them, or part with you. Believe me, he belongs
to them  let him go."

"And does he not belong to me?" cried Lizzie
in her despair.

Ah, that you know best," said he. " If you
really believe he does, keep him."

But Lizzie felt, even as she spoke, that Ernest
aspired to something different from what a life
with her could ever be. How could she endure
hereafter to see him a discontented spiritless
drudge, and to know that she alone, of all people
in the world, had stood between him and wealth ?
The sweet dream of life and love with Ernest
would be marred if she held this secret for ever
in her heart. Yet if it were told, would it not

slowly sap, if it did not suddenly kill, his love for
her ? She looked up once more at Thorpe. He
stood, tapping his boot with his stick, not looking
at her, waiting for her decision, the incarnation of
cruel common sense, immovable as a rock. She
gave way all at once.

Mr. Fletcher, you are right, and I will set him
free. I will indeed! Only, can't you spare me
one thing  must he think me false? Don't let
him believe me so vile as to say over and over
again that I'd be true to him till death, and then
desert him like this !"

Show me how, and I'll do it," said Theophilus
doggedly: but he added under his breath, "if I
walk a thousand miles for it !"

Oh ! I can't." She moved on a little farther,
walking like one in a dream. Then, "It's allover,"
she said ; " I'll do it  let him think what
he likes. I promise  Mr. Fletcher, do you hear ?
I promise."

I hear," he said. But when he looked at her
something in her face startled him. " I say," he

hesitated. " You aren't going to  cry or  or anything,
are yon ? Don't, there's a good girl, if yon
can help it. You've behaved so uncommonly
well, you know."

Cry !" said Lizzie, with intense scorn. "Cry !
Mr. Fletcher, you don't understand. Girls cry for
little things. Perhaps "

"Yes, they do!" he assented with a sigh.
Even in her agony Lizzie noted it with bitter
amusement. Had ever girls been fools enough to
try to soften Thorpe Fletcher's heart with weeping?
" But you needn't be frightened. I shan't
cry now," she went on fiercely. " Tears wouldn't
be any good, unless one could shed them of
one's heart's blood, and die ! "

Don't ! " said Thorpe anxiously. He had
been like iron in the battle, but he felt feeble and
ashamed now that his triumph had come.

Suppose I break down," said Lizzie. " Suppose
when I try to deceive Ernest I find I can't !
What shall you say if I break faith with you so ?"

This was business, and he answered promptly,

'nothing at all. Our bargain will be off, of
course. You won't try to deceive me, not to
mention that I am rather too wide-awake to betaken
in by you."

We shan't try," she cried hotly.

"I know you won't. I said so. But don't
you think you run a greater risk? You've
nothing but my word. Can you trust me ?"

"Yes," she said, "I trust you." This man
had been cruel to her, had coolly swept her out of
his path ; she knew little of him, and yet she felt
that she could trust him utterly. And she was
right.

But what do you promise ? " she asked, after
a brief silence. "If Ernest refuses your help 
what then?"

Theophilus deliberated before he made answer.
I can manage Master Ernest somehow, perhaps
without his knowing anything about it. I won't
consider myself free so long as I am  well 
fairly well off, and he is poor. Will that do?
Only let us make it clear what I do undertake.

I don't promise that Ernest shall be my heir.
He may be, I can't say. I may marry, you
see."

Of course," she assented impatiently. What
did she care whether Thorpe Fletcher married or
remained single? She supposed there might be
women in the world who woidd care to have him
as a suitor. As to any property he might leave,
she did not give it a thought. Waiting for dead
men's shoes is a miserable occupation at the best
of times, but he would need a rare gift of patience
who should set himself to wait for the shoes of
this man of seven or eight and thirty, who stood,
strong, sleek, and healthy, by her side.

But whether I do marry or whether I don't,"
said Theophilus, " I'll do my best to provide for
him. I can't keep him in idleness, but if he
chooses to take his chance with me we'll grow
rich together. And if I'm not good enough for
my gentleman, which is most likely, he can go
into the Church. I suppose that will be good
enough  even for his mother's son."

They were close to Lesboroiigli, so close that,
not wishing to conclude their conversation in the
street, they halted on the old redbrick bridge,
just outside the town.

"That is settled, then," said Lizzie, with a
calmness which startled and almost deceived her
companion. "Now, good-bye, Mr. Fletcher, and
thank you."

Don't see that you've got much to thank me
for," was his reply. " But I won't forget you. If
ever there's anything I can do, if you'll just let
me know "

"Thank you," said Lizzie, again with an intensity
of scorn which he quite failed to comprehend.
" Whe7i I let you know."

I'm sure you deserve something," he went on,
fancying that his offers of service were accepted.
You've been so uncommonly good and sensible
about it  seen things in just the right light.
There aren't many girls "

Thanks, but never mind the rest. I'm cold
and tired, and I must hurry home."

Shake hands on our bargain' he said, holding
out his great hand with the ring on it.

"What need?" \Yas her answer, eyeing it
doubtfully. She felt a queer repugnance at the
idea of touching his hand, as if it had literally
thrust her away from Ernest. But he obstinately
held it out, and she ended by allowing her own to
be grasped and cordially shaken.

One moment," said Fletcher, still holding the
unwilling fingers, and bending down to look
through the gathering dusk at the yet more unwilling
face. "You are so quiet, I can't make
you out. Look at me, will you ? Are you going
to break your heart about it ? I daresay, after all,
you know best  why don't you stick to him and
throw me over, eh?"

I hold you to your bargain," she replied.

"You do? Well  only take a moment to
think it over, won't you?"

Do you want to back out of it, Mr. Fletcher?"

Oh, if that's how you put it, of course I
don't," he began.

She tried to wrench her hand away. "Who is
that  Ernest V she exclaimed.

His eyes followed her frightened glance, and
rested on an indistinct figure in the meadow below
standing by the water-side, almost in the shadow
of the bridge. It moved swiftly away as she
spoke. " I don't know," said Theophilus. " Are
you afraid of his seeing us ? A little bit of
jealousy might not be such a bad beginning,
eh?"

Lizzie stared blankly at him for a moment.
Then she crimsoned, tore her hand out of his
grasp, and fled.

Theophilus Fletcher was left on the old bridge.
It may fairly be supposed that he was triumphant ;
at any rate he was in possession of the battlefield,
for through the wintry twilight was dimly visible
a slim, graceful figure, flying in haste towards the
twinkling Lesborough lights, while another figure,
also with his back towards the conquering hero,
strode along the frozen river bank. The triumphant
man stood musing a little while. Then,

coming to himself with a shiver, he went home to
the house in the High Street, had tea with Selina
and Caroline, declined the cribbage with which
the younger of the sisters seemed disposed to
indulge him, and finished the evening with a
double allowance of brandy and water.

Events sometimes plod so wearily along that one
grows heartsick between them, but there are days
when they rush to meet one another. So at least
Lizzie thought when she had nerved herself to
encounter Ernest.

He was very unhappy. His uncle's coming
had driven him almost to despair. It was bad
enough before with Selina and Caroline, but his
home life had not altogether unfitted him to wage
a womanish war of words, and they had no advantage
over him, except the possession of their small
income, and the melancholy little house. But
Theophilus took his stand upon the solid ground
of his success, and was not to be conquered with
words. In that feminine household it had seemed

no disgrace to live from day to day in idleness ;
but his uncle's presence reminded Ernest that he
too was a man, with a man's inheritance of toil.
Since the first night he had felt that heavy hand
ever on his shoulder, impelling him towards the
destiny he hated.

Lizzie, timidly doubting what she could say to
him, was assailed with a storm of reproaches. As
in bodily pain Ernest might have bitten his lip,
or clenched his hand, till the self-inflicted torment
partially deadened the other, so his sombre irritation
found some relief in making Lizzie a sharer
of his suffering. Eor in his eyes she was one with
himself, and he never dreamed that anything
could part them. His attack was not altogether
without cause, for Lizzie's apparent friendliness
with the man he hated most on earth made his
burden heavier to bear. But, angry as he was, he
did not really believe the insinuations he made.
He could not seriously think that Lizzie was false
to him. He had a show of right on his side, and,
goaded to madness, he used the weapon which was

ready to his hand. Did he not know that she
would refute the accusation, and promise to have
no more to do with the hated Theophilus ?

Ten minutes later the pair stood with averted
eyes, aghast and incredulous. Neither had ever
realised the horror of the blow which had fallen
upon them; they felt as two children might, if,
being at play, they chanced to put out the sun in
heaven. Ernest, instead of being caressed and
soothed, had met with a swift and terrible reply,
If you think so meanly of me, we had better
part." Even then he could not think she meant
what she said. He shifted his ground a little.
Had he no cause for thinking so ? " he demanded.
Cause ! " she replied indignantly, while she
struggled with the great lump which would come
up in her throat at the thought of the pain she
was inflicting. " If you are capable of suspecting
me  and it seems you are capable  it is enough,
and more than enough ! " As she uttered the
words she felt that fortune had favoured her
marvellously. She was getting on nicely, she

thoiiglit, and her heart was breaking. And Ernest
remarked to himself, with a stab of despair, the
intensity of the anger which almost choked her
voice. " I have offended her for ever," he thought,
and he answered in a mood as desperate as her
own.

Not ten minutes and it was accomplished, this
e\T.l which could never be undone. No fullest
expression of penitence, no passionate kisses of
reconciliation, could efface the memory of this
moment when they were two, when, though their
bitter wounds were aching, they stood apart in
their divided lives. If Lizzie had not understood
this, she must have thrown herself at Ernest's feet
to ask for pardon. " But it would never be the
same again ! " she cried to herself " It would be
worse than if I had never listened to Thorpe
Fletcher. It is too late  too late  but why did
God ever let him come ! " Too late  she drew
herself up, and stood with lips compressed and
downcast eyes.

Too late for Ernest also. He had gone so far

that he did not know how to draw back. He
would have given anything in reason  say all his
life but just a quarter of an hour  to have undone
the work of those few minutes and taken his love
to his heart again. But he could not sacrifice his
pride; so he too stood in gloomy silence, stunned, and
vaguely thinking what a merciful thing an earthquake
would be, or any peril that might give him
a chance of springing to Lizzie's side to die with
her. But the lane at the bottom of the Misses
Fletcher's garden, with a bit of orange peel and a
little wisp of straw lying in the dust, and its dead
walls garnished with broken bottles, hardly seemed
the place in which to hope for any startling deliverance.
None came, indeed. Only a boy appeared,
wheeling a barrow, and whistling "Beautiful Star."
As he went by he looked up sideways, with impudent
curiosity, at the lady and gentleman who stood
so silently, a little way apart, and was so much
amused that he trundled his barrow as slowly as
possible, while Ernest scowled at him.

But at last the urchin's red woollen comforter,

VOL. II.  L

fluttering in the bitter wind, disappeared round
the corner; "Beautiful Star," very much out of
tune, died away in the distance, and the young
man advanced a step and spoke.

There's no use in standing here to be stared
at, is there ? And as I daresay we shan't meet
for a long time, we might as well say good-bye."

Startled, she raised her eyes, and never saw
the tremulous hand which was almost ready to beheld
out. " What do you mean ? Ernest, are you
going away?" And her heart beat with sudden
fear, lest the lad should rush from the net which
she and Theophilus had so benevolently woven
for him.

Very probably," he replied, with a faint flush
of gratification at the idea of playing the part of
superior coolness. " I have not, as you know, had
time to make any plans, but I shan't trouble you
long."

"Don't do anything rash!" she cried, "Ernest
don't!"

He looked at her in wonder, for he could not

mistake the tone of passionate entreaty. Then,
since she did care what became of him, why had
she cast him off? Was it for Thorpe Fletcher ?

I don't quite understand," he said. " I'm not
going to cut my throat or be found in the river 
do you mean that ? "

(The latter assurance especially was not hard
to give. It might have been different on a sultry
August afternoon, when the current was strong
and cool between its reedy banks, with the eternal
blue above it, and the burnished dragon-flies darting
over the little pools. Ernest might have
fancied then that he had strength enough to
end his troubles, where it was smooth and deep
beneath the old red bridge. But to push away
the leafless bushes, to break the thin crust of ice,
and to plunge, with numb fingers and chattering
teeth, into the black stream which slid below 
he knew well that he had not courage for that,
nor indeed for any violent end just then. His
chilly, languid frame shrank from the thought of
blood, or poison, or half-frozen water.)

"10, no, no!" cried Lizzie; "don't speak as if
such things were possible ! And don't be hasty 
take time to think before you decide on anything.
It's your whole life, you know  oh, take time !"

You are very kind," said Ernest, striving hard
to preserve his lofty coolness. " I daresay I shall
manage very well, thanks."

God grant you may ! Ernest, try not to be
angry with me !"

"My anger can't matter much to you now;
and I hope other people will be pleased with you
as no doubt they will. What more can I say ?"

You mistake me," she said. " You are unjust
to me 1 "

Was he unjust? He turned upon her with
sudden passion. "Prove it !" he said. His voice
was changed, his very features were transformed ;
he towered above her, prouder and manlier than
ever before. "Prove it, and I will ask your
pardon on my knees 1" But he took her swift
change of colour for the pallor of conscious guilt,
and before she could even stammer "ISTo, no, I

lizzie's bargain 149

can't' in deadly fear at having so nearly betrayed
herself, his face had relaxed, and wore its former
look.

I beg your pardon," he said ; " I forgot we
had settled that it was all over. I needn't stop
any longer, I think. Good-bye." He lifted his
hat to her with stately courtesy, as if he were
the proudest of the Vaughanss, instead of young
Fletcher, the bankrupt ironmonger's son, and
before she could answer his good-bye he was
gone.

Lizzie never knew how she got home, though
she had a dim recollection of climbing the stairs
to her room, and feeling as if the steps were
multiplied by tens and twenties. Then she was
lying on the floor, wondering why God would not
let people die outright, when they did not want
to go to heaven or anywhere. What was the
good of dying if one could not sleep even then,
but must wake and live again ! Oh, what a
sham a quiet churchyard was, and what a mockery
a corpse's face ! If she were dead her face would

be still and full of rest, and all the time she
would be alive somewhere, and if alive, then
thinking of Ernest; and if thinking of Ernest,
then, although dead, still crying out for death.
So she moaned in her first misery, lying on the
boards.

But after a time she sat up, pushed back the
dark cloud of her hair which had fallen down,
clasped her hands round her knees, and thought
of Thorpe Fletcher. She had done her part, and
he must do his ; and he would do it, she was well
assured, for he was true as steel. Her only fear
was lest Ernest should decide on anything rash
before Theophilus could interpose, and she would
not suffer herself to think of this possibility.
Her weakness left her no choice but to trust this
man utterly. She told herself that she hated
him ; yet, as she sat on the garret floor, her only
comfort was to dwell on his name, "Thorpe
Fletcher," as if it were a tower of strength.

Her mother, calling from below, " Lizzie, are
you ready ? Do you know that it is nearly two

o'clock?" brought her suddenly back to the world
of fixed hours and afternoon lessons. She sprang
to her feet and put up her hair with trembling
fingers. The face which looked out of the dusky
little glass was white, but very brave. The great
clear eyes looked straight into the future, and saw
a hopeless life of poverty. From first to last her
one thought must be to pinch and save. She
would grow thin and faded in her dreary round
of teaching ; she could never marry because she
could not love again ; her gladness was over, and
all her bright days were gone. She would work
for her mother ; but in due time her mother
would die, and she would be left alone. And
after awhile there would be no Lizzie any longer,
but a Miss Grey, with a prim cap and formal
manners, trying to save a little for herself, and to
keep her old age out of the workhouse, by imparting
her small stock of knowledge and feeble old-fashioned
accomplishments to the children of her
former scholars. Perhaps, when she should be
altogether past work, if she were very fortunate.

her little savings, with a little charity, might
suffice for the needs of her frugal existence,
and lay her in the ground when it was over.
Hurrying to Mrs. Croft's that afternoon, she took
the first step towards this life from which she so
recoiled. If it had been only for a little while 
but she felt so young as she ran down the street !
So young that she was sure she could escape no
portion of this dreaded fate. She would have
time and strength to sound its every depth. She
would Hve long years with it, till she gradually
assumed the hideous likeness of her destiny. It
was not the poverty she feared, but the Lizzie
Grey who would remain when all was done.

As the town clock struck three that afternoon,
Ernest knocked at the door of a cottage where a
jobbing gardener lived, who was employed at rare
intervals by the Misses Fletcher. " Can your
husband lend me a pickaxe ? " he asked the woman
who opened it.

The abrupt question confused her. "I don't
know, sir, I'm sure," she said. " Won't you step
in and speak to Clark? He's had a kind of a
chill on him this last week, and to-day says I,
Clark,' I says, ' you just stay at home and Til get
you some stuff from the doctor's, or you'll be
regular ill.' "

Ernest strode past her to where Clark cowered
over a black kettle, which indicated the spot

where a fire was supposed to be, and repeated his
request.

"Can I lend you a pick?" said Clark, laboriously
turning the idea over in his mind. " I don't
know as how I can. Bill, you leave that poker
alone." (Bill, who was thumping a saucepan-lid,
kindly desisted for a moment, and sat on the floor,
staring up at Ernest.) " Leastways I must have
it back afore night. I've got a job to do tomorrow.
Us poor men can't afford holidays same
as you gentlefolks can."

I'll bring it by six," said Ernest impatiently.
"Will that do?"

I don't know but that'd do well enough. But
whatever do you want a pick for, Mr. Ernest?
The ground, it's like iron with the frost."

That's why I want the pick, of course," said
Ernest quickly. He turned to Mrs. Clark, who
had dusted a chair for him. " No, thank you ; I
won't sit down. I'll take it if you'll give it me,
please. ISTo, I won't have one of the boys bring it.
I'd rather carry it myself, and I want it noisy

He drew a long breath of relief when he stood
once more under the leafless limes, where there
was small fear of any intruder. The little maid
had gone on an errand, Dorcas would not leave
her warm kitchen, Aunt Caroline, too, would have
hesitated for an hour before she ventured out in
such bitter weather, Aunt Selina was nursing a
swelled face over the parlour fire, and, most important
fact of all, Theophilus had been summoned
to town by a telegram, and would not return till
the next day. Ernest might go fearlessly to work.
A spade lay where he had flung it in anger at its
uselessness, and pussy blinked sleepily in the most
sheltered corner. Ernest began his task with
vigorous, if unskilful strokes. Cold as it was, he
was soon glad to strip off his coat, which made a
nest for Sandy, while he resumed his work with
redoubled energy, striking fiercely at the hard
earth. Since he parted with Lizzie he had
weighed every word she had uttered. When she
answered him indignantly, he had been sure of
his own injustice. When she betrayed her sudden

confusion, he had doubted. Since he had
been left to himself he was sure of her guilt.
She saw I should never do any good, and she's
right  I never shall. There he was, paying her
attentions ; a rich man, who could make her
mother and her safe and comfortable for life ; and,
naturally enough, she is ready to take him."
Ernest stopped aghast. Was he thinking thus of
Lizzie ? " I'd have killed any fellow who hinted
half as much a week ago !" he thought.

He judged Theophilus and acquitted him. " He
acts after his kind  that's all. He doesn't know
what she was to me, and he's just the man to
amuse himself with a pretty girl. He's busy now ;
but he'll remember her as he comes from town tomorrow,
and smile his sleek smile, and cross his
legs, and think how well he sees through her, and
how pretty she is, and  oh, Lizzie, Lizzie, why
weren't you true to me ! I was a poor sulky
brute, and I was rough to you often, but in my
heart of hearts I worshipped you ! Poor girl, she
is sorry for me, I know. Perhaps she thinks that

one of these days she will sit on Thorpe Fletcher's
knee, and put her arm round his neck, and coax
him to do something for poor Ernest. And poor
Ernest will take whatever is given him, of course !
No ; I think we're neither of us quite so poor  are
we, Sandy ?  as to take anything from Lizzie Grey.
I know a better way than that  don't I ? "

He had planned his own future easily enough.
Never again, if he could help it, would he see
Lizzie or Thorpe. He would leave Lesborough
that night, and enlist on the morrow. But he had
not forgotten his poor old favourite. It should
not be starved and stoned when he was gone ; it
should not even, in some groping way, miss the
little kindness its dreary life had known. The air
resounded with his ringing strokes as he toiled at
his final provision for Sandy. It might be absurd
to spend so much thought on his cat, just when he
had lost his love and all his hope ; but Ernest
looked as tragic as if the grave were for Lizzie
herself instead of the wretched animal which sat
licking its paws and washing its ugly face. And

in truth he meant to lay something of the past in
it. He had always been sure that his cat would
be petted for his sake, and the grave was to be a
token for ever that he would rather trust aught
that he loved to its keeping than to Lizzie's.

Presently Sandy drew himself up into a hideous
arch and mewed.

You're hungry, poor old fellow ! " said Ernest,
rubbing softly under the skinny chin outstretched
to court his caresses. " And I've nothing for you
nothing, Sandy ! but very soon it won't matter ;
and I rather think you'll be the best off, after all.
Only I don't like this murderous sort of mercy.
If you could only understand ' But to be in the
dark, and to be helped so  oh, Sandy, poor old
Sandy ! I do hope I shall manage to do it so
quickly that you won't have time to know that it
is I!"

A snowflake fell upon his hand, the herald of
a multitude flickering slowly down. He looked
up, saw the lilac-boughs stirring uneasily against a
threatening sky, and accomplished the brief remainder

of his task in haste, while the storm
whirled round him. It was all over, the deed
was done, and the young fellow, feeling very
like a murderer, was stamping the earth down
again, and trying to efface the traces of his work,
when through the eddying flakes came a peevish
cry, " Ernest ! Ernest ! Are you out there,
Ernest ? "

"Coming!" he cried with unwonted alacrity,
for he did not want any one to come to him.
Coming directly ! " He gave a final touch to the
ground, thrust his tools aside, and catching up his
coat, he struggled into it as he ran.

Miss Caroline eyed him with sour curiosity.
What's the matter with you ? " she said.
"Here's a letter come by the second post, who
on earth is it from ? "

Letters were not plentiful with Ernest. He
opened this one, read it, and uttering a curious
inarticulate cry, he caught at the doorpost to
steady himself For a moment all things vanished
in a sudden haze. Then he seemed to see Aunt

IV

Caroline, with open mouth and startled eyes,
swimming in the mist, and clutching feebly at
him.

Dorcas ! Selina ! 'VMiat has come to the
boy?"

The tone brought them both  Dorcas wiping
her hands on her apron, and Miss Selina muffling
her swelled face in a shawl. Ernest had recovered
himself a little, and stood up in the midst of the
wondering group.

It is good news ! " he began. " At least 
no ! " drawing a hasty veil of propriety over the
bare selfishness. " I mean it is good for me,
though it is very sad. My uncle, Mr. Vaughan,
has been drowned yachting in the Mediterranean,
with his only son."

And you'll have some money ? " cried Miss
Selina.

The estate  Southdale. At least so I understand
it."

Southdale ! " The sisters looked at each
other in awe ; they had heard of the glories of

Southdale. " Let me look ! " said Aunt Selina,
gasping for breath. Ernest resigned the letter,
and the spinsters' faded faces jostled each other
over the wonderful tidings. Sudden transformations
are not confined to fairy tales and pantomimes,
as we are prosaically wont to believe.
When the Misses Fletcher looked up from that
magical page, there stood before them, where their
sullen slouching nephew had been but a moment
earlier, a tall aristocratic young man, carelessly
and even meanly dressed, it is true, but betraying
his rank in look, and word, and distinguished ease
of manner. " Oh, Ernest, my dear boy, what a
happy day this is ! " cried Miss Selina, and
offered him her best cheek to kiss ; while
Miss Caroline fondled one of his hands in her
skinny fingers. "Oh, what a happy day!" she
echoed.

Isn't it ? " said Ernest. He drew himself up
and away from Miss Selina's caress, and she could
only fasten herself on his other hand. " Isn't it a
happy day ? Does any one know whether there

VOL. II. M

is a Mrs. Vaughan ? What do you suppose she
thinks of it ? "

Since Providence has ordained it, we will
hope she sees that it is her duty to be resigned,"
said Miss Selina.

And I daresay she is well provided for," Miss
Caroline interposed.

That would make resignation easier, no
doubt " said Ernest. " Do you think a good example
would help her at all? Because I feel
quite resigned to my fate, and shall be happy to
set her one. You would be sure of the wisdom of
Providence if you were in my place, wouldn't you,
Aunt Selina ? I must show myself worthy of
being your nephew."

"That I am sure you will do," she said
warmly.

Are you really ? Quite sure ? And Aunt
Caroline too?" (She was testifying delight by
rapturously worrying his hand.) " How should I
begin?" He looked from one to the other with a
sneer. " By being grateful to Providence, that

lizzie's bargain 163

when the yacht went down my uncle was onboard
? Oh ! and do I add a special thanksgiving
because my cousin went down with him ? "

"My dear Ernest!" she hesitated, "I am
not sure that I would put it so, exactly."

Ernest is a little excited and can't be expected
to X3ick his words just now' exclaimed Miss Caroline.
She turned to Dorcas. " Of course Mr.
Ernest is a little excited, it's only natural, isn't it,
Dorcas ? "

Dorcas had rapidly decided that she had
nothing to hope from Ernest. The bitter dislike
between them had been the growth of years.
No use my trying to smooth him down now, he
won't stand it," she thought, so she answered
sourly. " Well, Miss Caroline, that sort of talk
may come natural to Mr. Ernest  seemingly it
does  but I call it downright wicked  so there ! "

Ernest wrenched himself away from his aunts,
and grasped her hand. "And you call it just
what it is," he said ; " it's the truest word you
ever spoke, old Dorcas, and God knows I'm

sorry for the poor lady ! " (As it happened Mr.
Vaughan had been five years a widower.) Dorcas
stood utterly confounded, having merely followed
the instinct which led her to say the most disagreeable
thing she could. Golden possibilities
flashed before her eyes, but she had no idea how
she had pleased Mr. Ernest, nor what she ought
to do for the future.

"Now mind," said the young master sharply,
"not a word about this till tomorrow  not a
syllable to any one. My affairs shan't be chattered
about in this gossiping hole till I am well out of
it."

Oh no ! Of course not !" said the sisters, with
blank disappointment on their faces. And Selina
added, "You mean to go tomorrow then?"

"First train. Don't you see this man says
they'll meet me ? If it weren't for that I'd go tonight."


''Oh, Ernest!" moaned Aunt Caroline, "is it
too much to spend one more evening in your old
home before you leave it for your splendour?"

"You will go before Thorpe gets back!" cried
Selina in dismay.

'well, you don't suppose I should stop for
him'' said Ernest. "If I were going to start as
an ironmonger he might be some good. He
wouldn't exactly help me in starting as a gentleman!"


The sisters quite agreed with him in this estimate
of Thorpe, and Selina felt rather ashamed
of having mentioned him at all.

Ernest's remembrance of that evening is like
the remembrance of a dream, where vivid clearness
wars with as vivid a sense of unreality. He had
that dreamlike feeling of central loneliness with
which the sleeper sees a stream of fantastic changes
eddying round him, while he is himself unchanged.
The spinsters' fond caresses were grotesque and
hateful as a nightmare. But the time came at last
when he could escape from their tearful enumeration
of his many virtues, and take refuge yet once
more in his garret. He had to pack, he said.

His packing did not take him long. He put a

few clothes into a little portmanteau, adding to
them one or two trifles which had belonged to his
mother, and a couple of books which Mr. Markham
had given him. Then he stood looking at a faded
rose, some morsels of coloured sewing silk, and a
torn scrap of paper with fragments of words
pencilled on it in a dashing hand. Gifts from
Lizzie he had none. Once, in the first bloom of
his passion, he had declared that true love had no
need of such tokens, and Lizzie had reverenced the
chance utterance as a sacred law. But later
Ernest himself had felt a natural longing for some
remembrance of her, and had hoarded these things
for her sake. He eyed them a moment, crushed
them in his hand so that the dry rose crumbled
into innumerable fragments, and openings fingers,
let them drift to the floor and lie there. The act
was emphatic. There is a certain tenderness in
burning such things. You will treasure them no
longer, but at least they shall be safe from insult.
Though love may be dead, no unkindly hand shall
be laid upon the corpse. But Ernest left the

memorials of his first dream to Dorcas and the
dust-hole.

He flung himself on his bed, and tried to realise
his altered fortunes. But it was too bewildering.
A gulf had suddenly opened to part him from his
former life, and Selina, Caroline, Theophilus, nay,
Lizzie herself, stood on the farther side. The idea
of her faithlessness glided past him in the strange
procession of events, and seemed natural enough
in the universal change. So, between sleeping and
waking, the night wore away, till the Lesborough
clock struck five, slowly as if it were a knell.
Ernest suddenly remembered that Clark was going
to work that morning and would want his tools.
It was a curious fact that nothing was changed for
Clark, and that he was still doomed to toil with
the pickaxe which Ernest had borrowed in a
previous existence, and omitted to return. It set
bounds to the stupendous transformation which
had absorbed the young man's thoughts. He perceived
that he was not the centre of the universe,
and was somewhat sobered and saddened in consequence.

And lie also perceived that he had
broken his word. After lying for a few minutes,
meditating on these things, he sprang up and
hurried on his clothes in the dark, for his candle
had long since died in the socket. " He can't goto
work before six," he said to himself. ''I have
time yet," and he felt his way downstairs, unbolted
the door, and stepped into the garden.

It was cold but very still. There was no breath
of wind nor any sound of life. After a minute,
when his eyes became accustomed to the darkness,
he distinguished the line of the wall, and guided
himself by that till he turned the corner, trod on
a roughened spot, and knew that he had reached
Sandy's grave. He knelt on one knee to feel for
his tools, and having found them, he lingered,
laying his hand on the cold earth, as if he caressed
his dead favourite. "Good-bye, old Sandy," he
said softly; "if I had only known, you should
have feasted like a king, old fellow ; but it's too
late. Only last night, Sandy, you came to me,
mewing to be let in " As Ernest spoke he

chanced to look up, and the words died on his lips.
Overhead a lamp in a garret window burned like a
great star in the blackness, girding a leafless poplar
with a band of yellow light. The world slept, but
Lizzie shared his vigil. He knelt for a moment,
gazing upward. Then he started to his feet and
spoke under his breath, lifting his hand towards
the far-off brightness.

If I have judged wrongly  if I have misunderstood
 I dare not think it, but if I have 
God give me a chance to make amends ! If she
marries Thorpe Fletcher I shall know that I was
not mistaken. If not, I will come back some day,
we will stand face to face, and this miserable
mystery shall be cleared up. Till then, good-bye,
my Lizzie, if by any wonderful chance my Lizzie
still lives." He stamped in sudden anger on the
hardened ground. "As if I didn't know it is
impossible ! Shall I come back and ask to be
fooled a second time ? " He turned to go, but
memories of the moments he had spent there, of
the beauty which was his life's one charm, of the

love wliicli never failed him till that fatal day,
conspired to hold him back. He looked over his
shoulder at the window, across which a shadow
moved. " I will wait three years ! " he vowed.
"I will not speak for three years. But then 
then  Lizzie ! " He made his vain resolve with
the fervour of boyish certainty, he meant every
syllable of it, he was ennobled by his victory over
his bitter pride. How could he realise that the
next three years might be a new lifetime, and
that before they were over, Lizzie, and Lesborough,
and this passionate promise of his, might be but
faded memories of a past to which he could not
return ?

Thorpe dwelt complacently on the thought

that Mr. Vaughan, who disowned his sister because
she married the ironmonger, had got the
ironmonger's boy for his heir. Then he remembered
Lizzie, and smiled to himself. "No need
for her to trouble herself about our bargain now.
He'll be true to her, I think  he ought to be
kicked if he isn't  a girl like that ! She deserves
her luck  she's one in a thousand!" Later in
the afternoon, when he had ended his meditations,
and rested awhile in pleasant drowsiness, he looked
at his watch, sprang up hastily, and went out,
hoping to meet Miss Grey.

He did meet her, and stopped short. This was
not the flushed, excited, triumphant girl he had
expected to see. She was pale and cold, and held
out her hand to him with a quiet smile. " I
wanted to speak to you, Mr. Fletcher," she said.

Is it possible  haven't you heard?" he began.

"About that poor Mr. Vaughan? Yes, Miss
Selina told me this morning."

Selina ! Didn't Ernest tell you himself ?"

She shook her head. " Ernest will never tell

me anything more. We had a difference yesterday.
It is all over."

Thorpe stood aghast. 'you kept your word
then!" He whistled softly, then finding that she
only looked at him in silence, he recovered himself
with a laugh. "Father a complication!" he
said. " We were a little too quick, eh ? But we
must set all that right, you know."

I thought you would say that."

"Of course I say so. That was what you
wanted me for ? "

They were at Lizzie's door. " Please come in
I won't keep you long," she said, and he followed
her into a fireless and only partially-furnished
room. The low ceiling made it oppressively
sad, and it was very cold. Thorpe shuddered in
his thick coat, and felt as if Lizzie had ushered
him into his sepulchre. She glanced at the desolate
hearth. " I'm sorry we have no fire. Won't
you sit down ? "

It doesn't matter  no, I'd rather stand, thank
you." He rested his arm on the chimney-piece ashe

spoke, and looked curiously at her. Why washer
face so white and still ?

How will you set everything right, Mr.
Fletcher?"

Oh, leave that to me  I'll see about it  don't
be afraid," he said with a slight swagger in his
tone. But it ended in a shiver. " Miss Grey, I
hoped you knew me better than to think I'd
leave you in the lurch."

I didn't think it for a moment. I knew you
wouldn't."

He advanced a step. "Well, what on earth
makes you look so miserable then ? "

How will you set everything right ? " she
repeated, fixing her eyes on his as she drew back.

"How? I shall go to Ernest, tell him my
plan, and the bargain I made with you  I'll take
care he understands how uncommonly well you
behaved  and I'll either bring him back, or a
letter saying lie isn't far behind it. That'll do, I
think?"

Thank you. Now listen to me. I forbid you

to say one word about me to Mr. Ernest Fletcher
mind, not one word. If you do, I will never
forgive you as long as I live."

He was not surprised, for he believed it was
the proper thing for girls to be romantic and high
flown. Of course it meant nothing. She was a
nursery governess, and Ernest had thousands a
year. He looked her coolly in the face and
smiled.

"And if I didn't, Miss Grey, I should never
forgive myself. On the whole I fancy that might
be the worst. Don't think I make light of your
anger, it will be very terrible, no doubt, but I
must bear it as I have borne a good many things ;
and as Ernest is not particularly fond of me, I'm
not likely to see much of you in future  am I?"
He spoke in an easy tone, and waited for her
answer. He expected a little more apparent reluctance.
It was very foolish, but he felt that he
owed her a patient hearing.

You will go to him in spite of me then ?" she
said.

He nodded. "Rather well put," he thought.
"I reply 'Yes.' She shrugs her shoulders  the
matter is taken out of her hands. She has not
asked the young man to come back to her, and of
course she is not answerable for what / insist on
doing. I call that neat." But as he looked at
her with smiling decision, it suddenly struck him
that there was a strangely resolute look in Lizzie's
eyes. Could there be some earnest in the sham
fight ? He hurried up an argument.

What do you take me for. Miss Grey, to ruin
your prospects, when I can't fulfil my share of
the bargain? Eemember, I can do nothing for
Ernest now."

She answered swiftly, " AHien we were walking
home that day, you said Ernest would never be
happy here, but that if he went to his own people
he must go alone. You meant it, I suppose ? "

Ah, but that was different. He would have
had his uncle to please. Iow he has only himself."


Isn't he to have any friends then ? Was

Mr. Vaughan the only man in the world who
would have looked down on me ? Say, if you can,
that it would not be better for Ernest to be free.
Ah ! you cannot ! "

Why would she force the unwelcome truth
from him ? " Let Ernest decide that," he
said.

He can't. If you tell him, you mil compel
him to come back. No, for his sake it is
best as it is. We have served him," this with
a dim smile, " though not quite as you
meant."

"But for your sake?"

For my sake you must be silent." She advanced
a step, and looked up into his perplexed
face. " Mr. Fletcher, if I were your sister, would
you go and ask a man to come back to me the
day after he came into a fortune ? You know you
wouldn't, you would be too proud, you would die
sooner. Oh, can't you understand that even I am
too proud for that ! "

You mustn't sacrifice yourself to your pride,"

VOL. II. N

he said, for justice impelled him to take her part
against herself and his nephew. "Ernest could
only love you the better for what you have
done."

"For the first moment  yes. But he would
soon think, ' She could give me up  for my sake,
no doubt  still she could give me up when I
was poor, and she found she could not as soon
as I was rich.' No, I should die of shame.
It is best as it is. I know that I am not fit for
him, and you know it too. You must keep ray
secret."

He stood silent and perplexed. He no longer
questioned her sincerity, but might she not
repent ?

You won't give me your word ? Very well,
then I give you mine, that I won't listen to him
if you bring him back. You will have betrayed
me for no good. You know whether I mean
what I say, and when I gave him up I gave him
up altogether."

If he comes of his own free will ?"

She smiled a little. " We wil talk of that
when it happens, or the day after doomsday, if
you like. He will not come. He used to want
me," her voice quivered as she said it, "but he
will not want me now."

In his heart Theophilus perfectly agreed with
her. Pride and temper would assuredly keep
Ernest away till he had had time to appreciate
his new position, and then there was little chance
of his return. And for that very reason he was
anxious that Lizzie should think well before it
should be too late. "You are sacrificing yourself,"
he said.

"Not now," she answered. "That was done
and finished when we were on the bridge. You
are only asking me to undo it."

Giving up the master of Southdale appeared to
Thorpe widely different from giving up a sulky
lad, who was too fastidious to work for this living.
He stared at the fender, drawing down his brows
in a heavy frown. The engagement would no
doubt be an undesirable one for Ernest, whose

feelings and ideas would naturally alter, and who
would find himself bound to his boyish love when
nothing else of his boyhood remained in him.
Such marriages were seldom happy, people said,
and Ernest was one who would be ashamed of his
wife's lowly origin, and who would live in uneasy
apprehension lest she should betray it by word or
look. It could be a mistake, Thorpe was sure of
it. Lizzie herself said the same, and refused to
call her lover back. Then why should he go out
of his way to injure poor Fanny's boy, and bring
about this perilous marriage ?

But this girl  was she to toil her whole life
through, while young Ernest spent his uncle's
fortune ? She had given up all for his sake  was
he to go away, rejoicing in his escape from the
scheming woman who had outwitted herself in
jilting him ? And Theophilus himself  should
he turn on his heel, not one farthing the poorer
for that bargain of theirs, and leave her despoiled
of all ? God forbid ! Thorpe's sturdy sense of
justice cried out, and deep down in his heart there

Awoke a new and strange feeling of wonder, of
reverence, of something for which he knew no
name. Had he not been so abominably cold that
all energy was chilled out of him, it seemed to
him that he might have risen to the occasion, and
known what to say and do. But though Lizzie
faced him calmly, Theophilus was shivering from
head to foot, and felt helpless and blue. What
could he do but make his escape without having
absolutely pledged himself to silence ?

"If I did promise to keep your secret," he
said, " it would have to be on one condition. You
must let me do what I can to help you, and to
make some amends."

He stopped in the hesitating sentence, for he
encountered her scornful glance. " I don't think
I understand," she said. " Are you offering to 'pay
me for giving up Ernest ? I think we may as
well say good-bye now, I needn't keep you in the
cold any longer." Something in her look made
Theophilus sure that his misery must be very
evident indeed. " Only, Mr. Fletcher, I hope you

quite see that any interference between Ernest
and myself will be worse than useless. You
wished to part us, and you did it. You may as
well be content with that, for you cannot bring us
together again."

Repulsed, scorned, and numb with cold, Thorpe
Fletcher still saw that haunting phantom of
justice, and did his best to follow it. He tried to
say that perhaps  at some future time  if she
should think better of it  aud found himself in
the act of being ceremoniously shown out of the
vault-like room. The sky outside was heavy with
coming snow, and with one glance at it he hurried
home, and called to Dorcas for a big log for the
fire. Long and deeply did he meditate, with eyes
fixed on the crackling blaze, and hands softly
rubbed in the delicious warmth. A great thing
had befallen Thorpe. He  who never doubted
his ability to rule the world in the best possible
way, if people would only listen to him and to
common sense  was not absolutely certain that
he had improved matters by meddling with Ernest

and Lizzie. And as he still thought that commonsense
was on his side, he sat wondering whether,
by any possibility, there could be something in
life not to be ruled by common sense, as he understood
it.

Two years and a half of the life, to which Lizzie
looked forward so despairingly, had passed away,
and Lesborough lay broiling in the August sun.
The Misses Fletcher panted and fanned themselves,
opened windows which had long been closed, and
would almost have proposed to sit in the garden,
had it not been as parched and shadeless as the
desert. The poplar beyond the wall quivered in
the haze of heat. To Lizzie, toiling wearily
through the dust, the hot sunshine seemed very
pitiless ; and she wanted pity, for things were not
going well with her. The little Crofts were
supposed to have grown beyond her teaching, and
had been sent to a boarding-school ; and though
the grocer's wife loudly proclaimed that she could

speak very 'iglily of Miss Grey, the recommendation
was of little service. Lizzie gave a few
lessons here and there, and imparted a smattering
of French to the baker's daughter ; but that was
all she did, for it really seemed as if no one in
Lesborough had any little children needing a daily
governess, except Mrs. Bradley, of Park Villa.
She had three charming little girls, and, only a
few weeks earlier she had asked  almost entreated
Miss Grey to take charge of them, offering a
singularly liberal salary. But Lizzie, for no
apparent reason, had declined the situation 
civilly, but rather coldly. It was incomprehensible,
but it was not so easy to understand
Lizzie in these later days. She was altered in
face and manner ; her great gray eyes looked even
larger than of old, and seemed to have grown
darker since the happy light had died out of them.
Some people said she had gone off very much, and
looked old for her age; but others thought her
handsomer than ever, as she went by with a look
on her face that was at once haughty and patient.

The years that had passed had been even drearier
than she had feared, but her resolution was unchanged.
She had a curious liking for the old
redbrick bridge. Now that she had so much
leisure she would often walk that way, and if she
found herself alone there, she would lay her hand
almost caressingly on the low wall.

Theophilus Fletcher had prospered greatly
during these two years. The Lesborough foundry
was far more important than his predecessor ever
dreamed of making it. Trade received a new
impulse from the throng of grimy workmen, who
apparently looked on wages as manna, and thought
it would be impious distrust to save a farthing.
Fletcher's patent harrows and thrashing-machines
were widely advertised; and as the big man
shouldered his way through the crowd on market
days, people made room for him with ever-increasing
respect. He interested himself in local
reforms, he gave liberally to local charities, and
the grounds of his handsome house were always
open for flower-shows or school treats. The Rector

found him a valuable ally, and he gradually began
to make his way into the most exclusive circle of
Lesborough society. Mr. Staunton, the Member,
whose estates were encumbered, whose family was
large, and whose manners were consequently
bland, saw that Fletcher might be a power in the
coming election, and paid court to him accordingly.
Mrs. Staunton was lavish of her smiles; Miss
Staunton was very gracious. She had taken rank
as the beauty of the family ten or twelve years
earlier, and had been so hard to please that at
twenty-nine she found herself still Miss Staunton
of Lesborough Park, with five half-sisters, who
had passed from the nursery to the schoolroom,
threatening a speedy termination to her reign.
She tried her well-worn fascinations on the commercial
millionaire, partly from habit, but with a
hesitating idea that something might come of it.
She shrank from the possibility, and yet it fascinated
her with its mixture of splendour and degradation.
Theophilus never suspected this, but
he met her half-way. It was not his nature to be

reserved or frigid with a pretty girl who amused
him, and who, in his opinion, was very well able
to take care of herself. He was flattered by the
Stations' civility, and so heart-whole that he
could enjoy Elinor's little attentions. He meant
nothing at all, and she was not sure that she
meant anything, but nevertheless the Lesborough
gossips began to talk.

Lizzie Grey heard the reports as she went on
her way, but she took no apparent heed of them.
What was Mr. Fletcher to her ? It was true that
she saw him occasionally at his sisters' house.
She went there as of old, and heard the Misses
Fletcher boast about Ernest, who was at Oxford,
they said, and intimate with the nobility. She
used to listen with a faint smile. He had taken
his uncle's name on succeeding to the property,
and was Ernest Vaughan now. This small fact
seemed to part the present time from the bygone
days when Ernest Fletcher loved her. The little
parlour seemed shadowy and strange, even when
Theophilus came in, with jovial laugh and keen

blue eyes, straight from the open air of his busy
everyday world. He was good-humoured and
cordial, though he did not say much to her, and
never alluded to their useless compact. But one
night Lizzie was weary and depressed. She
listened helplessly to Selina and Caroline as they
retailed the latest scandal, but through it all she
was conscious that her life had come to a dreary
pause, and that hope, energy, and courage had all
ebbed together. Suddenly there was a loud knock
at the door ; Selina stopped short in the middle
of a spiteful comment, and Mr. Fletcher came
in.

"At tea?" he said, as he threw himself into
the easy-chair. " Well, yes, you may give me a
cup."

Lizzie, who was cutting bread and butter, knew
that he had looked at her when they shook hands,
and she valiantly endeavoured to meet his glance
as gaily as of old. But she was startled when he
turned, fixed his eyes on her face, and remarked
abruptly : " I saw you to-day, Miss Grey."

"Did you?" she said, beginning to cut another
slice. " I didn't see you."

"No, I know you didn't." A guilty colour
mounted to her cheek, but she made no answer.
I saw you on the old red bridge  I say, take
care!"

The warning came too late ; the knife had
slipped and cut her hand. She muffled it quickly
in her handkerchief, and looked up defiantly.
It's nothing !" she said, angry with herself for
the mischance.

But the cut, thought not serious, was deep,
and the blood was flowing. Miss Selina ran aimlessly
about, proposing sugar, cold water, rag, lily
leaves. "No, no!" Miss Caroline exclaimed, "a
door-key down her back ! I know that's the best
thing. I've always heard that a door-key  or is
that when your nose bleeds ? "

"Rubbish!" said Thorpe, "a bit of plaster!"
And before Lizzie knew what he was doing he
had thrust his sisters aside, had taken possession
of her wounded hand, and was unfolding the

lizzie's bargain 191

handkerchief. A glance sent Selina and Caroline
flying in different directions for plaster, and for a
moment the two were left alone, and face to face.
No word was said, but Lizzie was strangely conscious
of the firm pressure of his fingers, and was
conscious of nothing else. How long was it before
the sisters rushed in with their respective plaster-cases
?

"I can manage it now, thank you!" she said
hastily.

So you think," he replied. " I suppose you
thought you could cut bread and butter. I'll do
both for you to-night."

As Lizzie sat in enforced idleness, and drank
the tea which he brought, it seemed to her as if a
measure of new strength and defiant courage had
come back to her. She laughed and talked more
like her old self, though she would not encounter
those watchful eyes. The hands of the little
clock on the chimney-piece went hurrying round,
till Mr. Fletcher glanced at it, started, compared
it with his great gold watch, and said he must go.

Lizzie perceived that it was the time at which she
usually left, but she felt that it would be like
asking for his escort if she announced her departure
when he had just spoken ; so she waited, wondering
why on earth he waited. At last, after leaning
back some time in frowning silence, he stretched
himself, said, "Well, I suppose I must be off,"
and did not stir. Lizzie, determined to outstay
him, talked on, till Miss Caroline yawned openly,
and so compelled her to give way. But when she
would have said " Good-night " to Mr. Fletcher,
he stood up. " Why, I'm going too," he said, " I'll
see you home." She tried to refuse, but Selina
hurried her off that she might not keep him
waiting. Gentlemen didn't like to be kept waiting,
she explained to Lizzie as they went upstairs.
Lizzie was soon ready, and a minute later she
found herself in the moonlit street with Thorpe.

The pair went a few steps in silence, till a
sudden impulse made the girl look up. The light
fell on her companion's face, and showed her that
he was looking at her, from under his heavy

brows, with a direct intensity which sent a shock

through her from head to foot.
Take my arm," he said.
She shook her head, and walked more quickly.
Miss Grey, what is amiss ? Are you well ?"
She was astonished. " Yes, I'm very well."
"You mean it ? You are not ill, really?"
Of course I mean it ! Thank you for your

kind inquiries, Mr. Fletcher, but I am perfectly

well."

Then something else is the matter ; you are

unhappy." She took no notice, and after a moment

he went on, in low tones which were even more

imperious for their self-restraint : " Answer me,

Miss Grey ; are you unhappy ? "

They had reached her door as he spoke. She

was silent still, but not with the silence which

would have been an admission of unhappiness.

She gathered all her strength, and met his eyes

with a look of inquiry and defiance.

No answer ?" he said. " Xo concern of mine,

of course. Oh, you are quite right. Miss Grey

and doubtless rejoiced at the success of his
scheme.

It so happened that Lizzie saw no more of him
till the beginning of August, when a bazaar was
held for the Lesborough Church Schools. She
had a glimpse of him then, as she passed the Town
Hall late in the afternoon. The Stauntonss'
carriage waited outside, and, as she walked, she
looked at the beautiful, impatient, chestnut horses,
sleek and shining in the sun, and listened to the
music of the military band within. Xot till her
shabby gown almost brushed the splendour of silk
did she perceive the great Mrs. Staunton, with
her electioneering smile, escorted by Theophilus
in all his glory. Her primrose fingers rested on
his sleeve, and his face was radiant. Lizzie
remembers him to this day, as he stood on the
lowest step, the thick gold chain, which Ernest
hated, glistening in the hot sunshine, the pale
gray gloves, the crimson rosebud in his coat.
Had she not been taken by surprise she would
have turned away, but he had seen her, their eyes

had met, and instead of the good-humoured nod,
which he often bestowed upon her, he lifted his
hat with a ceremonious yet eager politeness which
challenged Mrs. Staunton's attention. She looked
after Lizzie with lofty wonder, and a faint involuntary
admiration, lost the thread of what she was
saying, bade Mr. Fletcher farewell a little absently,
and drove off, sighing at the idea that a wealthy
man should have such threadbare acquaintances.

Mrs. Staunton rather liked him than otherwise
in fact, she liked him well enough to say
Eeally ! I'm very sorry," when a few days latera
rumour ran through the town that he was mixed
up in some foreign speculation and had lost money.
People hardly knew what to think, but looked
doubtfully at one another. It was so unlikely that
they could not believe any one could have
invented it. And when Mrs. Staunton expressed
her languid sympathy, her husband merely replied,
I should say it wasn't true ; but if it is, the man
must be a fool. Literally coining money at that
place of his, I'm told."

Well, I daresay we shall hear more soon," she
said. "Didn't you say we must give another
dinner?" and she passed easily to the more
interesting topic.

Lizzie Grey heard nothing of the report. Perhaps
she was hardly in the mood to listen to
Lesborough talk just then, for her prospects were
darkening from day to day. The baker's daughter,
having discovered that she knew French enough
to give her a fine sense of superiority to her friends,
had discontinued her lessons, and her teacher was
left more hopeless than before. While Mrs.
Staunton was arching her brows over the tidings
of Thorpe Fletcher's losses, Lizzie sat by her
mother's bedside, trying to impart a courage she
could not feel. "I shall die in the workhouse,"
moaned Mrs. Grey.

"ISTo, no!" said Lizzie. "It cannot come to
that." But she trembled as she said it, and lay
awake half the night, tormented with visions of
sombre possibilities. It was in no sanguine frame
of mind that she prepared to go out the next

morning. She was just starting when the little
girl, who waited on the invalid during her absence,
came to her with a breathless message, "Please,
Miss, Missis wants to speak to you. And, please,
Miss, will you come at once, Missis says."

Why, what on earth " Lizzie began, as she

dashed past the child into her mother's room.
"What is the matter, mamma ?"

Mrs. Grey was sitting up in bed, with shining
eyes, and a faint tinge of colour in her cheeks.
"I was prapng to God last night, and He has
heard me. Lizzie, look!" And she held out a
blue envelope, at the sight of which Lizzie stood
rooted to the ground.

A man left it at the door, Sarah says ; a
young man she does not know. Who could it be ?
Oh, Lizzie, do you see what it is ?"

"Yes," said the girl slowly. "But we can't
keep it, mamma."

Xot keep it ? It is meant for us  look at
the envelope  it is directed to me ! " ]airs. Grey's
words came in startled gasps.

VI

I know it is sent to you," said Lizzie. " But
you must let me take it back."

Back !  who sent it then ?"

"Mr. Fletcher." The name came out with a
painful effort. " He has sent me money before 
more than once  and I have sent it back."

Mrs. Grey stared blankly. "What, Ernest
Fletcher  no, he's Vaughan now, isn't he? Do
you mean him ? "

No. Mr. Theophilus Fletcher at the foundry.
Miss Fletcher's half-brother."

Why does he send it ? I suppose he wants
to make you some return for your attentions
to his sisters. Oh, Lizzie, we can't send it
back!"

"Listen, mamma!" cried Lizzie in despair.
Two years ago I happened to serve Mr. Fletcher
you must not ask me how, because it is not my
secret only  at least he will have it that I served
him, and ever since then he has been trying to
pay me in some way. And because I would not
have his money he has sent it to you. He is good,

he means it kindly, but I can't take his money.
Don't ask me why, mamma, but let me give it
back  I can't take it !"

But it is mine !" cried the poor weak woman.
He sent it to me !" And a dangerous look came
into her eyes, as if she would do battle for her
treasure with her shaking hands. Lizzie drew
back a step and looked sadly at her.

"It is mine!" Mrs. Grey repeated, in her thin
voice. " I shall keep it for your sake. You shall
not have to work yourself to death for me."

Then, mother, you will not keep me. I cannot
share it. I have no claim on hun. He thinks
I lost something through him, but I know it wasn't
so. T can be paid for that day," she added, half
to herself. " Oh, mamma, we have never had a
quarrel before !"

But Mrs. Grey was not easily conquered. The
poor woman clung to her prize as if she were
in the agony of drowning, and this a saving rope.
"Mammal" cried Lizzie, with streaming eyes, "I
can work ! I vill work ! You shall not want ! It

'' I know it is sent to yon," said Lizzie. " Bnt
yon inst let me take it back."

Back ! who sent it then ?"

"Mr. Fletcher." The name came ont with a
painful effort. " He has sent me money before 
more than once  and I have sent it back."

Mrs. Grey stared blankly. "What, Ernest
Fletcher  no, he's Vaughan now, isn't he? Do
you mean him ? "

No. Mr. Theophilus Fletcher at the foundry.
Miss Fletcher's half-brother."

Why does he send it ? I suppose he wants
to make you some return for your attentions
to his sisters. Oh, Lizzie, we can't send it
back !"

"Listen, mamma!" cried Lizzie in despair.
Two years ago I happened to serve Mr. Fletcher
you must not ask me how, because it is not my
secret only  at least he will have it that I served
him, and ever since then he has been trying to
pay me in some way. And because I would not
have his money he has sent it to you. He is good,

he means it kindly, but I can't take his money.
Don't ask me why, mamma, but let me give it
back  I can't take it !"

"But it is mine !" cried the poor weak woman.
He sent it to me !" And a dangerous look came
into her eyes, as if she would do battle for her
treasure with her shaking hands. Lizzie drew
back a step and looked sadly at her.

It is mine ! " Mrs. Grey repeated, in her thin
voice. " I shall keep it for your sake. You shall
not Ive to work yourself to death for me."

Then, mother, you will not keep me. I cannot
share it. I have no claim on him. He thinks
I lost something through him, but I know it wasn't
so. I can't be paid for that day," she added, half
to herself. " Oh, mamma, we have never had a
quarrel before!"

But Mrs. Grey was not easily conquered. The
poor woman clung to her prize as if she were
in the agony of drowning, and this a saving rope.
"Mamma!" cried Lizzie, with streaming eyes, "I
can work ! I will work ! You shall not want ! It

would kill me if I had to live on Mr. Fletcher's
charity !"

It was a hard struggle. On Mrs. Grey's side
were feeble arguments, and strong entreaties and
tears, and in answer the patient voice pleading,
I can't take it. He owes me nothing at all."
At last it was over, and Lizzie came out. She had
the blue envelope in her hand ; she was going to
return it that afternoon, and her mother had kissed
her as she stooped to say " Good-bye."

"Was I cruel?" she said to herself, when she
was once more in her own room. She went to the
window. The poplar was trembling in the summer
breeze, and below lay the strip of garden down
which Ernest used to come in the days which
seemed so long ago. " I hope I wasn't cruel," she
thought, leaning out to cool her aching eyes. " I
have done nothing for him. He thinks it was a
sacrifice, and I thought so too once. But I can't
make money out of that ; it would be a lie, and I
should die of shame !"

The foundry stood a little way out of Lesborough,
and the way to it led through the ugliest and most
uninteresting part of the neighbourhood. Mr.
Fletcher said it was a good level road, and he
couldn't see anything amiss with it. Still, let him
say what he would, it was not beautiful that
August afternoon. On both sides, parted from it
by low banks and closely-cut hedges, lay meadows,
marshy and wide, coarsely overgrown with
yellowish-green grass, and dotted here and therewith
patches of rank weeds, and tail flower-stalks
whose blossom was gone. Trees there were none,
except a straggling line of alders and willows which
marked the river's languid course. No road is
pleasant when one travels on a disagreeable errand ;

but Lizzie found an especial dreariness in this one,
as she turned into it, and saw it visible in its flat
monotony almost to the foundry-gate. She felt
that she could not risk a repetition of that morning's
conflict, nor the chance that another gift
might arrive, and be accepted without her
knowledge. She must refuse Mr. Fletcher's
money in terms about which there could be no
mistake. She could not wait for a chance meeting,
since it might not occur for weeks, and he would
think all the while that she had taken his bounty-there
was no help for it ; she must go to his
office and find him there. And the road was so cruel,
it kept the end of her journey continually before
her. Every step brought her visibly nearer to that
dreaded interview the mere thought of which made
her heart die within her, yet the way was so wearily
long. She walked as fast as she could, conning
over the words she meant to say, with an uneasy
certainty that Mr. Fletcher's eyes would frighten
every syllable out of her head. If ever she feared
hmi in old days, she feared him ten times more now.

At last she reached her destination. She
wondered at her own calmness as she passed
through the gate : and, following the guidance of
a painted hand, walked straight into the office.
Is Mr. Fletcher here ? " she asked a clerk.
"Will you tell him that I particularly want to
speak to him ? I will not keep him long." It
seemed to her as if, in uttering the words, she had
contrived for a moment to outstrip her own
nervousness, and it overtook her exactly as she
ceased to speak. She felt the hot colour in her
cheeks, and the eager beating of her heart made
it hard to catch the man's reply. But she knew
that she gave her name, and that a white-faced
lad, whom they called Bates, went upstairs to ask
if Mr. Fletcher were disengaged. The civil clerk
gave her a chair, and she sat, looking through the
open window into the busy, grimy yard. A man,
who seemed to be a farmer, came in, and looked
curiously at her as he went by. He leaned on
the desk and spoke, and the clerk glanced at her
over the newcomer's shoulder, and smiled as he

answered. Why had she ever come ? She would
have run away, but she had a wild idea that the
clerks and the farmer would think her mad and
follow her, shouting, till Bates, and Thorpe
Fletcher himself, would come thundering down
the uncarpeted stairs to join in the pursuit.
She waited in an agony of suspense till Bates returned,
and asked her to step upstairs. She
followed him with desperate courage. He ushered
her into Mr. Fletcher's room in silence and closed
the door after her.

It was a small room, bright and sunshiny.
Thorpe had been building extensively at the
foundry, and his office, which was only temporary,
gave a general impression of new boards. Lizzie
advanced a step towards the table, which was
covered with papers, and then saw him standing
at the window. He turned and came towards
her, with a doubtfully inquiring look. " Soothing
the matter, I hope, Miss Grey ? Pray sit down."

There is nothing the matter, only I wanted
to speak to you. I won't keep you a minute."

You are always welcome to as much of my
time as can be of any service to you," said
Fletcher, apparently reassured, and anxious to reassure
her. He resumed his former position by
the window, a position in which the light did not
fall on his face, but whence he could look sideways
at the Lesborough road.

Lizzie pulled out the envelope. " Mr. Fletcher,
you sent that."

He glanced at it, and nodded in the most
matter-of-fact way possible, but his eyes went
quickly back to the ribbon of dusty white which
lay across the level fields.

I have brought it back," she said, puzzled at
his manner. " Pray don't send any more."

"You don't want it?" He tapped the pane
with restless fingers.

No."

You have found a situation which suits you,
perhaps ?" he event on, this time looking straight
out of the window and fairly turning his back
upon her.

Lizzie, perplexed and nervous, had half forgotten
what she meant to say. His question put
the clue into her hands once more.

No, I haven't. I did hear of one, and when
I went to ask about it, I found it was only another
way of living on your alms."

The idiotic woman ! She overdue it, I suppose,"
growled Thorpe, manifestly disconcerted,
but without the faintest attempt at disguise.

I am sure she tried to keep your secret, Mr.
Fletcher. But you have taught me to suspect
any good fortune, I think."

His answer was an inarticulate grunt. He still
kept his back to her. It was very disagreeable
to have to address her remarks to his shoulders
and what she could see of the back of his head,
which he held down doggedly. The one idea
conveyed by the outline of those shoulders was
that of inert and ponderous obstinacy. But she
continued, passionately determined to pierce this
armour in some way or other :

Mr. Fletcher, I am tired of this. Ashen will

you leave off persecuting me ? You sent me
money, I returned it to you. You persisted again
and again. Then you leagued yourself with that
woman to cheat me into taking your charity." (At
this point the big shoulders became a little more
expressive, for they were shrugged.) " What have
I done that I should be paid for it, with a banknote
thrown to me every now and then? And
what business have you to pay me ? I have done
nothing for you. What I did, I did because I
thought it was right. I am quite content, and
you have nothing to do with it. Still you might
have gone on, and it would not have mattered.
/ could have gone on returning your presents.
But why did you send this to my mother?"

She did not pause to hear some muttered
words which sounded remarkably like, " Thought
she might have more sense than you had."

You would have enlisted my own mother on
your side against me ! " said Lizzie, in accents of
bitter reproach ; " when we never had a real
difference in our lives."

VOL. II. p

Oh ! " said Thorpe, " then she had more
sense ? "

"Yes, if you choose to call it so. Yes; she
wanted to take your charity for my sake. But I
told her that she must choose between it and me,
that I wouldn't touch the bread she bought with
it, nor live in the house that was maintained with
your gifts. I told her that I had no claim on you,
that I had done nothing for you, given up nothing
for you, and that I would never be a pensioner of
yours."

So the old lady sent it back ? " Thorpe questioned,
in a curiously gentle voice.

"Yes; here it is," said Lizzie. Having expected
either persuasion or rough words, she did
not know what to make of this calmness. His
face was still obstinately turned to the window.

Put it on the table, anywhere, it doesn't
matter. I shan't offend in that way again."

Thank you," said Lizzie.

Probably not in any way."

Lizzie laid the guilty blue envelope on the

table, and hesitated. He had spoken the last
words with a certain bitterness of emphasis ; what
did he mean? She had wished to make him
understand her inflexible determination, but she
did not want to part in anger. She would have
held out her hand to him and gone her way, but
for an absurd little difficulty. "What was the
good of holding out her hand to that broad graduated
back? And speech had become difficult
again. Now that she had ended the sort of
understanding which had existed between them,
and, no doubt, offended him for ever, she hardly
understood her own confused and warring feelings.
Only she was conscious of a lurking something,
which she would die rather than reveal,
and which a word might betray. Better shake
hands and go. But he still stood at the window,
with his back towards her and his head bowed
down. She had hesitated only for a couple of
minutes, but all at once she started, feeling as if
she had been waiting for ages in the silent sunshiny
room. As if she had known the little office

in some previous existence, and had stood there,
precisely the same, on some occasion, say a
million years before. As if everything else were
a dream, or as if that were a dream, she hardly
knew which. As if  but Thorpe Fletcher drove
all the rest out of her head by turning round
and facing her.

What are you stopping for ? " he demanded,
in his roughest tone. "You want nothing from
me, you would die sooner than let me serve you
in any way ; you hate me  you say so."

She attempted a denial, and held out her hand,
but he ignored it.

"Xo; as you have stayed you shall listen
to me for a moment, since I've had to listen to
you."

Mi Fletcher, are you ill ? Is anything the
matter ? " she exclaimed. As soon as she saw him
in the full sunlight, she perceived that he was
haggard and anxious. She started as she met his
eyes. Though keen and clear, they were small,
and overshadowed by his heavy brows, but that

day there was a fierce spark of fire burning in their
grayish blue.

111 ? " he repeated. Lizzie Grey could not
know it, but the Thorpe of twenty years earlier
had come to the surface again, and confronted her
that day. "Am I ill? Is anything wrong?
What the devil is it to you, Miss Grey, whether
there is or not? It's good manners to ask, I
suppose ; but you know well enough you don't
care. However, you shall hear, since you have
asked." He took a turn or two up and down the
little room, with the old effect that there seemed
to be no place for any one else in it. Lizzie drew
back a step to let him pass. He halted instantly.
Why don't you sit down ? What's the good of
tiring yourself after your walk ? "

Thank you, I'd rather stand," said Lizzie.

Stand, then 1" was the rough rejoinder. "Look
here. Miss Grey ; I'd give my right hand to have
been miles away two years ago, instead of coming
here to meddle with your affairs. I can't see now
what I did wrong ; it seems to me that no one

with any sense could have clone otherwise. But
everything went crooked; I'd better have let it
alone altogether."

Oh, don't let us have all the old story over
again ! " said Lizzie. " Mr. Fletcher, I don't blame
you, I never blamed you ; pray don't say any more
about it."

Thorpe turned upon her : " But I choose to say
something about it. It's the last time  can't you
have a little patience ? Whether I did right or
wrong, I ruined your prospects ; you can't deny
that. I ruined you  you, of all people in the
world ! I'm not going to talk about love at first
sight, or any of the stuff they put in poetry. When
I came to Lesborough I hadn't thought of marrying,
at least not for a good while; I had other
things to see after. But I soon began to think of
it  I believe it was partly because I was sorry for
what I'd done, and I wanted to do what I could to
make it up to you." Lizzie looked blankly at
him, struck dumb by this singular frankness.
But you were so brave," he went on, " and behaved

so uncommonly well, that I saw the luck
would be on my side instead of yours. Only,
when I'd made up my mind that you were the one
girl in all the world for me, and that if I couldn't
have you I'd have no one, I couldn't tell you so.
I kept thinking, suppose Ernest should come back,
I should never forgive myself if I'd ruined it all
again. (There, don't say anything, let me finish.
Didn't I tell you it was the last time ?) Not that
I thought you would be happy with him ; I never
did. But you had a right to choose for yourself.
So I waited, and worked, and said to myself that
you should be richer as my wife than if you had
married Ernest with his estate. Only, as I knew
things were not going very well with you, I tried to
help you, just to keep your head above water till we
should see what the boy would do. You wouldn't
let me. I tried again, and I found out how it was :
you hadn't forgiven my blundering, you weren't
generous enough to let me do anything for you.
Then I did try to help you without your knowing,
but it seems you were too sharp for me  "

Mr. Fletcher !" cried Lizzie.

Can you have patience for five minutes ? "
he demanded. " I suppose you think I'm a rich
man? I don't know whether I am, or whether
I'm ruined. I've done well enough here, but it
was too slow for me ; so I risked it for you. I
meant to come straight to you if all went well 
of course it would have been no good."

You have failed, then ? " said Lizzie, advancing
a step, with a new light in her eyes.

You needn't be in such a hurry," he replied.
I tell you I don't know. But I heard something
yesterday  what does it matter to you ? Only if
it's true there'll be a smash here  this place shut
up, and all my men out of work. My God ! what
a fool I've been ! " he said, with a quick little
gasp. "Ah, well! you'll read it all in the next
Lesborough paper, I daresay. Young Marshall
promised me a telegram." He glanced at the
road as he spoke. "But what do you care?
Only you see how well you chose your time to
reproach me and fling my money in my face. I

want you to see that. Ernest will never come
back now  never. And if I'm beggared, it would
have been a pity for me to think that I had helped
you a little till I could make a fresh start 
wouldn't it ? No ! I'd better begin the world
again at forty, knowing that I've lost all for
nothing ; that I've ruined you and myself too ;
that you hate me, that you would rather starve 
and it will come to that, I daresay  than touch a
coin of mine, rather oo to the workhouse than let
me help you. Very well, be it so." He turned
to the window again. "I'm sick of it all!" he
said in a low voice ; " I can do no more  I give
up."

Quick as thought Lizzie sprang to the table
and caught up the blue envelope. " Mr. Fletcher !
I've taken it ! "

He looked round. " Taken what ?"
"This!" and holding it up, she went on in a
voice which wavered wildly between laughing and
crying : " Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher, and thank you !
I'm going to spend it  may I ?"

"Wliat do you mean?" said Thorpe. "Take
it  only  are you in earnest ? Do you see that
it isn't quite the same ? No, no ! don't say anything
! Take it, in God's name ! without conditions.
When the news comes "

She pointed to the window : " Is that your
messenger ? " she said, growing suddenly calm.

Yes !" said Fletcher. " Three minutes, and I
shall know. If I escape this time, I'U run no
more risks ; and you'll let me come and say what
I can for myself, won't you ?"

"No !" and Lizzie looked straight into his eyes.
If you do come I shall refuse to see you."

His face fell. " You will not see me ? " he
stammered, in utter bewilderment.

No ! If you want to say anything to me, you
may say it here, and now."

"Now?"

Before that message comes ; after that you
needn't trouble yourself. I mean what I say."

But, noir .? " said Thorpe. " I tell you I maybe
a beggar."

"A good thing too!" she exclaimed. "You
think of nothing but money. You are always
harping on the money I should have had if I'd
married Ernest; then you begin hoarding yours
for me  I hate it ! and now you insult me, yes,
insult me ! by promising to come  if all goes
well ! I suppose I'm a toy you will like to buy
if you are rich? and if you are poor, perhaps
some one else "

There was a noise as of an arrival below.

Lizzie, don't tempt me. Suppose the worst 
I'm not so young as I was, I'm twice your age,
child ; there's not much chance for me  I should
do you a cruel wrong."

I don't tempt you. Here comes your message.
I mean what I say  but you know that of old."

She drew back a little and watched him ; her
face was grave, defiant, intent. Theophilus turned
on his heel, and took a step or two irresolutely.
Bates appeared, laid a telegram on the table, and
vanished discreetly.

Fletcher came forward, but Lizzie's hand was

on it. She looked up at him, he was white to his
lips. "Will you have it ?" she said.

How much more harm am I to do ?" he asked.
If you would only let me help you ! " Their
eyes met : " Lizzie, I'm a selfish brute, but will
you share it, good or bad?"

Ten minutes later she was saying, a little
regretfully, "I almost wish you had been poor
for a few years at first."

"Thanks!" he said, passing his hand over his
forehead, and looking down at her with a smile.
Only by the sense of present relief could he realise
what his fear had been. " A few years ! You
can afford to talk like that. How old are you ?
Twenty? Twenty-one?"

Twenty-two  at least I soon shall be."

Thorpe smiled. " Well, I didn't mind talking
in that style when I was one and twenty; but,
now that more than half my life is gone, I'm
willing enough to work, but not to fight my way
through the crowd to get my foot on the lowest
round of the ladder again. I like to look forward

to the end ; I like to feel that I needn't pinch and
save. I like good wine and good dinners ; I
didn't care what I had at one and twenty."

I didn't want you to be poor for very long,"
said Lizzie ; "just a little while. You might have
had plenty of good dinners "  this very scornfully
" afterwards."

"You're very kind, but as I can't dine more
than once a day I don't see how I could make up
for lost time. No, no, Lizzie ! you must take meas
I am. I daresay it might be very nice to live
in a cottage with you to cook for me, but I shan't
be easy till things are made safe, and I know that
there isn't a chance of this bargain of ours turning
out as badly for you as the one we made two years
and a half ago."

But Lizzie Grey did not seem to think that
bargain had turned out badly for her. Something
was lost with that first dream, no doubt, something
of springtime had vanished, but there was
no shadow of regret in her happy eyes that
day.

It was easy to tell the great news to Mrs. Grey,
but Thorpe and Lizzie went together, a day or two
later, to communicate it to Selina and Caroline.
Thorpe tried to make a neat little speech, and
to present Lizzie as a new  hut he broke down
when he realised that the sentence ought to end
with " sister." It was too absurd, so he coughed,
and finished rather lamely  " a new relation, you
know." The Misses Fletcher were astounded and
displeased, and said they were delighted, and had
foreseen it from the first. They fondled Lizzie,
and kissed her tenderly, while Thorpe sat on the
sill of the open window, and looked on with twinkling
eyes. He did not like it so well when his own
turn came.

Come into the garden for five minutes, Lizzie,"
he said a little later. But his sisters detained her,
to ask if she wouldn't put something more on, and
to hang about her, as if she were going on an
expedition of some difficulty and possible danger,
and they could hardly bear to risk their treasure.
At last she escaped, and ran out, to find Thorpe

leaning against the door which led into the garden,
and talking to Dorcas.

Ah, here you are !" lie said. They went down
the path together, and paused when they came to
the little space at the end. Lizzie pointed upwards.
" That is my window."

Ah ! " said Thorpe. " I see. Very handy."

He leaned against the wall, and looked up at
the little window with its glittering panes. The
steep red roof which caught the western glow, the
two or three pigeons perched upon its ridge, the
poplar, hardly stirring in the still au', all stood
keenly out against the pale blue sky, and Fletcher
studied them as if he were learning them by heart,
I'm going to ask you a question," he said at last,
and I want you to tell me the truth."

She answered with a happy smile, "Do you
know, Thorpe, I hope it won't be very inconvenient,
but I'm afraid I shall never be able to
tell you anything else. I might, perhaps, if you
would shut your eyes, but not when you look at
me so."

Hm ! I think you managed to keep me in the
dark pretty well," he rejoined. " If I'd known, I
might have come and looked after you a little
sooner."

Instead of my having to come to you ! But
what is your question ? "

Isn't this where Ernest used to come ?"

She nodded, growing suddenly grave.

I know you care for me now," said Thorpe ;
I shan't ask you that. But suppose I had never
come to Lesborough at all, never interfered with
you and Ernest, you might have been very happy."

Perhaps," looking at the ground as she spoke.

Thorpe laid his great hand on her shoulder.
If everything had gone well, don't you think in
your heart that that would have been best of all ?
Your first love, nearer your own age, and I know
how you cared for him. Tell me, child," this very
gently  " I can't be happy unless I can get to the
bottom of things  tell me the truth, don't you
think that might have been the best ? You
needn't be afraid. Don't think I shall be angry.

I shall only want to do more to make you some
amends for what I can't give you now."

"Then," said Lizzie, still without looking up,
I'm afraid you won't take so much trouble about
me, for oh, Thorpe, I am very glad you came ! "

MITCHELHURST PLACE:

A NOVEL.

The Times says : " ' Mitchell-burst Place ' is interesting quite as much for what
it discloses of the poetic fancy of the authoress astor its study of character. Embedded
in these pages are scraps of verse which show considerable talent ; and even
the contemplation of the moon struggling in a stormy sky is not too hackneyed a
theme to evoke an imaginary flight, free from either bombast or pathos."

The .Sjiectoor says :  "A really good novel. . . . Now it is obvious, we think,
that the literary skill evinced in the above extracts would suffice for the production
of a very good novel indeed, provided that their writer had a good story to tell and
could tell that story well. Miss Veley and here we may notice a marked improvement
on her ' For Percival 'sis very strong on both points. ' Mitchelhurst
Place' is a story which rivets the attention from the first page to the last, and the
writer's management of her plot is perfect."

The Saturday Review says : "Miss Veley writes in excellent English and with
abundant cleverness and insight of one of Nature's step-children, of a man marked
down for misfortune to the extent of being himself his curse and his executioner."

The Guardian says : " An exceeding good novel."

A NEW NOVEL.

NE/ERA: a Tale of Ancient Rome.

By JOHN W. GRAHAM.

2 Vols. 8vo. 24s.

** Though the scene is laid in Ancient Rome, and the surroundings
are correctly given, it must not he supposed that this story, the first effort
of a nev writer, is of merely antiquarian interest. The opinions quoted
below sufficiently shoiu that the hook appeals to all readers echo care fora
well-told tale, full of thrilling incident and striking situations, skilfully
worked, out to a satisfactory denouement.

In a letter to a friend, published in the Atheniviim on December 4, Mr. Gladstone
says :  "Having finished 'Nesera,' I cannot refrain from saying that it seems
to me a really remarkable book, with great uprightness of aim, signal power of
drawing characterised a great faculty of Writing. . . . Several of the scenes are in
my judgment of singular power. The writer is unknown to me, but he ought to
make his mark."

The Edinburgh Review says : "It is given to us as a picture of Roman life,
under an Emperor as infamous as the Antoninus were honourable ; and the picture
is, we think, carefully drawn, and in its general features trustworthy. . . . Mr.
Gi-adam has at the least given us a story of sustained interest, which lie has done
well in connecting with the little island rock of Capri. On this island Tiberius has
left a lasting mark, and the remains of his work bear out the old stories told about
him. . . . We may take leave of Mr. Graham's interesting and powerful tale with a
few words in which he speaks of the palaces and prisons which rose here at the
despot's command."

Blackwood' s Magazine says : 
In the present work Mr. James forsakes entirely his usual levels. . . . He has
stepped aside into a very different field. London, but not the London he has
hitherto known . is the strange and novel scene which he has undertaken to
unfold before us ; London of the outlying-wastes, far from fame, purlieus of
Islington and Haddington and Camberwell  widely spread in point of distance, but
equally mean and grimy and poverty stricken. . . . This book is Mr. James's first
illustration of purely English life. It is remarkable both in its perceptions and its
mistakes  a most careful elaborate panorama, full of the finest observation."
