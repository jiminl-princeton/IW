CHAPTER I.

THE Lessees OP OAKBY.
Young barbarians all at play."

Some few years ago Mr. Gerald Lester was
the head of a family of good blood and
position, and the owner of Oakby Hall,
the great house of a village of the same
name in the county of "Westmoreland. The
border line between Westmoreland and
Yorkshire crossed his property; but his
house and park were in the former county,
for which he was a deputy sheriff' and justice
of the peace.

He was not a man of very large fortune,
and Oakby Hall was not a show place,
bat a well-built mansion of the last cenis
2

tiirj, with some architectural pretensions,
and standing in the midst o that sort of
wild and romantic scenery which, perhaps
more than any other, fixes the affections
of its inhabitants. Oakby, at any rate,
was very dear to its owner.

The great sweeps of heather-clad moor,
the fell sides, with their short green turf,
the fertile valleys, had a character of their
own, inferior as they were to the better-known
parts of westmoreland.

Oakby village was situated in one of the
largest of these valleys, and the Hall lay
low on the side of a hill over which the
well-planted park stretched on either side.
The house could be seen all the way up
the long carriage drive, for it was only
shut off from the iark by an iron railing,
within which the turf was mown close and
fine, instead of being left to be cropped by
sheep and cattle. The gardens were at the
side, and there were uo trees in front of
the house but one oak of great size and
beauty. There was a wide carriage sweep,
and the space between this and the house

was paved, and on either side of the
front door was a stone wolf of somewhat
forbidding aspect  the crest of the
Lesters.

The grey stone house thus exposed to
view was stately enough, and though too
open and free to be exactly gloomy, this
northern front was bleak and cold, especially
on a frosty winter twilight, when the
light was dying away in the distance, and
the piece of ornamental water and the
pleasant bits of woodland beyond were not
distinctly visible. No such thought ever
crossed the minds of the young Lesters,
who came back to it from school and college
as to the dearest of homes ; but to a
stranger, a little doubtful of a welcome,
it might perhaps look formidable.

Within doors a blazing fire and abundance
of rugs and skins made the hall the most
attractive place in the house, both for dogs
and men; especially between the lights,
when there was little to do anywhere else,
and all were tired with their day's work,
or ready to discuss their day's amusement.

Just before Christmas play was legitimate
; and the young Lesters, skates in
hand, had just returned from the lake, and
were grouped together round the fire,
noisily praising and criticizing each other's
recent performances.

I never should have had a tumble all
day if Bob hadn't come up against me like
a steam engine," cried the one girl, a tall
creature of sixteen, big, fair, and rosy.

' I came against you ! That's a good
one. Who could keep out of your way?"
ejaculated the aggrieved twin brother.
You can no more guide yourself than  "

"A balloon," put in the more softly
accented voice of the eldest brother present,
as he unfastened his skates from the
neck of his great St. Bernard, who had
dutifully carried them home for him.

Now, Cherry, that's not true ! " cried
the girl in loud indignation. " Of course
I can't be expected to do figures of eight
and spread-eagles like you and Jack."

*' I saw an American fellow the other day
who skated twice as well as either of us."

No ? All ! I don't believe that ! " from
the girl.

"But then they've ice all the year
round," from Bob.

"I daresay they can't do anything else,"
from Jack.

Jack always is so liberal ! " from
Cheriton; and then, 'hush! here's the
squire."

It was sometimes said that no one of
the young Lesters would be so fine a man
as his father; and certainly Mr. Lester
was a splendid specimen of an English
gentleman, though the big Jack rivalled
him in inches, and promised equal size and
strength, while Cheriton, who was of a
slighter build, inherited his blue eyes and
brilliant colouring. But they were his
own children  every one fair, and tall, and
healthy; and their characteristic differences
did not destroy their strong resemblance
to each other and to their handsome
father, who now stood in the midst of
them with a foreign letter in his hand, at
which the children glanced curiously.

He Tf as not much above fifty ; his hair
and beard, which had once deserved to be
called golden, had rather faded than grizzled,
his skin was still fresh and healthy,
and his eyes bright in colour and full of
expression ; the level brows janet over
them. His children, as has been said,
were curiously like him  Annette, or Islets
as she was commonly called, perhaps
the most so. Although she was big and
unformed, she had the promise of great
beauty in her straight sulky brows and
large sky-blue eyes, resplendent colouring
which defied sunburn, and abundant yellow
hair. Her nose was straight and fine, like
her father's, but her full red lips were a
trifle sullen ; the contour of her face was
heavy, and though she looked well born
and well bred, she lacked the refinement
of intelligent expression. But if her great
blue eyes looked stupid and rather cross,
they were as honest as the day ; and at
sixteen there was still time for thoughts
and feelings to come and print themselves
on this beautiful piece of flesh and blood.

She was very untidily though handsomely
dressed, and had the awkwardness of a
girl too big for her age ; but as she stood
leaning back against the oak table, there
was such vigour and life in her strong
young limbs as to give them a kind of
grace. She had a low voice of refined
quality, but she spoke with a strong north-country
accent, as did her father. In the
brothers it was much modified by their
southern schooling. The twin brother,
Robert, retained, however, a good deal of
it. He was a heavier, less handsome likeness
of her, and might have been described
as a fine lad or a great lout, according to
the prepossessions of the speaker. The
next brother, John, or, as he was usually
called. Jack, had, at nineteen, hardly yet
outgrown the same ungainliness of manner ;
but his height, and the strength trained by
many an athletic struggle, could not fail to
be striking ; and though he had something
of the same sullen straightness of brow,
the eyes beneath were thoughtful and
keen. There was no lack of mental power

in Jack's grave young face, and he was a
formidable opponent to this schoolfellows
in contests of brain as well as of muscle.

Cheriton, except that his brows arched a
little, so that he could not attain to the
perfection of the family frown, and that he
was an inch or two shorter and much
slighter, was so like Jack that when he was
a:rave and silent his brighter colouring; and
the moustaches to which he had attained
were, at first sight, the chief joints of
difference between them. But then Jack's
face to-day would be his face tomorrow,
while Cheriton' s expression varied with
almost every word he spoke, so that he was
sometimes said to be the image of his
father, sometimes to be the one Lester who
was like nobody but himself; while, now
and then old friends wondered how this
handsome young man came to have such a
look of the mother, who had been no
beauty, but only a high-minded and cultivated
woman. He was his father's favourite,
and somehow his brothers were not
jealous of the preference. " Cherry," as

they called him, was the family oracle,
though he risked his place now and then
when his utterances were not in accordance
with the prevailing sentiment.

Mr. Lester's expression was now dark
enough to indicate annoyance of no common
kind ; but it did not take much to make
him look cross, and if his sons and daughter
had not known that there was an unusual
speck on the family horizon, they would
have surmised that the keepers were in
disgrace, the newspaper late in arriving,
or that they themselves had unwittingly
transgressed.

As it was they were all silent, though
Cheriton looked up with a question in
his eyes, and the twins glanced at each
other.

I have had a letter from  your brother
; he has started on his journey, and
will be here in a day or two."

Sto one spoke for a moment, and then
Cheriton said, 

Well, father, I shall be very glad to
see him. It's a good time for him to come,

and I hope wc shall be able to make it
pleasant for him."

Pleasant for Mm'' growled Bob.

*' It won't be at all pleasant for us'' said
his sister. " Fancy a foreign fellow interfering
in all our concerns. And Granny
says he's sure to set us a bad example."

*' Ay," said the father, " you lads needn't
be in too great a hurry to get up an
intimacy."

There's not much fear of that," said
Cheriton.

Ah, my boy," said Mr. Lester, turning
to him, " you take it very well ; but it's hard
on you ; no one knows better than I do."

As for me," said Cheriton, with a shade
of the characteristic family gruffness in
his much pleasant voice, '' you know it
has always been my wish that he should
come, and why should we set ourselves
against it ? "

He ought to have come sooner," said
Jack.

That's no affair of yours, Jack," said
his father sharply. "Don't be so ready

with your comments. He is coming
now, and  and I'll hear no more grumbling.
I'm hanged if I know what we are
all to make of him, though," he muttered
as he left the halL

He'd better not interfere with me,"
said Bob. '' I shall take no notice of him."

'' Poor fellow ! " said Cheriton satirically.

I won't kiss him, I declare," cried his
sister.

Now you boys, and Nettie, look here,"
said Cheriton seriously. " Alvar is our
father's son and our brother. He is the
eldest, and has his rights. That's the
fact ; and his having lived all his life in
Spain doesn't alter it. And if his coming
is strange to us, what will it be for him ?
Isn't it an awful shame to set our backs up
before we see him ? Is it his fault ? "

Cheriton's influence in the family was
considerable, and the younger ones had no
answer to his arguments ; but influence and
arguments are weak compared to prejudice;
and no one answered till Jack grumbled
out, 

'' Of course we must do our duty by
him, and perhaps he'll improve."

On acquaintance," suggested Cheriton,
with half-suppressed fun. " Suppose he's
a finer fellow than any of us, and a better
sort altogether. What shall we do then ? "

'' Oh, but he's a foreigner, you know,"
said Nettie, as if this settled the question.
Come, Bob, let's go and see the puppies
fed."

*' What I say is," said Jack, as the twins
went away and left their elders to a freer
discussion, " that the thing has been left
too late. Here is Alvar,  twenty-five,
isn't he ? "

Yes ; he is only two years older than
I am."

"-How can he turn into an Englishman?
It's all very well for you to chaff about it,
and lecture the young ones ; but the squire
won't stand him with patience for a day ;
there'll be one continual row. Everything
will be turned topsy-turvy. He'll go back
to Seville in a month."

Cheriton was silent. He was older than
Jack by nearly four years, and perhaps should

not have attributed so much importance to
the grumbling of this juniors; but this wider
out-look only enabled him to see that their
feelings were one-sided, it did not prevent
him from sharing them; and the gift of
a more sympathetic nature did but make
him more conscious of how far these feelings
were justifiable. Home life at Oakby had
its difficulties, its roughnesses, audits daily
trials; but what did this signify to the
careless boys who had no dignity to lose,
and by whom a harsh word from their
father, or a rough one from each other,
was forgotten and repeated twenty times a
day ? He himself had hardly grown into
that independent existence which would
make an unkindness from a brother an
insult, an injustice from a father a thing to
be resented beyond the day. It was still
all among themselves, they knew each other,
and suited each other, and stood up for
each other against the world. They were
still the children of their father's house,
and that tie was much too close and real
for surface quarrels and disputes to slacken
it. But this stranger, who must be the

very first among them all, yet who did not
know them, and whom they did not know,
who had a right to this same identity
of interest, and yet who would assuredly
neither feel nor win it !

Jack accused his father of having acted
unjustly to them all ; the younger ones
rebelled with a blind prejudice which they
did not themselves understand. Cheriton
was vividly conscious of the stranger's
rights, yet shrank from all they claimed
from him ; to the father he recalled resentment,
weakness of purpose, and a youthful
impulse, from the consequences of which
he could not escape. The grandmother
upstairs, no inconsiderable power in the
Oakby household, formulated the vague
distaste of her descendants, and strongly
expressed her belief that a foreign heir
would grieve his father, corrupt his
brothers, and ruin his inheritance.

And now who was this foreign heir,
this unknown brother, and what was the
explanation oE his existence ?

CHAPTER II.

THE SON AND Here.

Love should ride the wind
With Spain's dark-glancing daughters.

Some six or seven and twenty years before
the date when his sons were thus discussing
their elder brother's arrival, Gerald
Lester, then a young man fresh from
college, had been sent abroad by his
father to separate him from a girl, somewhat
his inferior in rank, for whom he had
formed an attachment. He was not then
his father's heir, as he had an elder brother
living, and he was supposed to be going to
make his way at the bar ; but though well
conducted and brilliantly handsome, his
talents and tastes were not of an order to
make success rapid or certain, and such a
VOL. I. c

marriage as he liacl contemplated would
have been, though he had a small independence,
peculiarly inexpedient. Though at
times passionate and defiant, he was not a
person of much strength of will; and he
yielded to the pressure put on him, partly
from sense of duty  for he was by no
means wanting in principle  and partly
because it was too much trouble to resist. .
The affair, however, left him in an unsettled
state of mind, and increased his
dislike to his profession. While wandering
about in the south of Spain, he became
acquainted, through some letters of introduction
with which he had been provided,
with a family of position of the
name of De la Rosa. "While staying with
them he met with an accident which
disabled him from travelling, and afforded
him time and opportunity to flirt and
sentimental with the beautiful Maria de
la Rosa, who fell passionately in love with
the handsome Englishman. Gerald's feelings
were more on the surface, but he was
much carried away by the circumstances ;

he felt that he would make a poor return
for the hospitality that had been shown
him if he only " loved and rode away."

He was enough irritated by the compulsion
that his father had put upon him
to feel glad to act independently; while
the natural opposition of Don Guzman de
la Rosa to his daughter's marriage with a
foreigner, stirred Gerald to more ardour
than Maria's dark eyes had already
awakened. Her birth, at any rate, was all
that could be desired, her religion ought
not to be an objection in one so good and
pious, and the nationality of his younger
son's wife could be of no consequence to
old Mr. Lester. Don Guzman was not a
zealous Catholic, and he yielded at length
to his daughter's entreaties ; the young
Englishman's small independence seeming,
in the eyes of the frugal Spaniard, a
sufficient fortune.

Gerald Lester and Maria de la Rosa

were married at Gibraltar, the difficulties

of a legal marriage between a Protestant

and a Roman Catholic being almost inc

2

surmountable on Spanisli territory. In
Gibraltar they lived for some time ; but
the marriage was not a happy one. Maria
was a mere ignorant child, with all her
notions irreconcilably at war with her
husband's ; and Gerald, who had his ideals,
was very unhappy.

After some months, the sudden illness
of his elder brother summoned him home,
and while he was absent his child was
born unexpectedly, and his young wife
died. He learnt almost at once that he
was his father's heir, and that a son
was born to him. It seemed no moment
for making such a disclosure. His grief
for his brother sheltered the shock and
surprise of the death of the poor young
wife, and he satisfied his conscience by
writing to the English clergyman who
had solemnized his marriage, and desiring
that he should baptize the boy
according to the rites of the English
Church. As this stipulation had been
made at the marriage, Don Guzman allowed
the order to be carried into effect. But as

no desire was expressed by the father as to
a name, it was christened Alvaro Guzman
the Spanish grandfather omitting* the
Gerald, which he felt had been an ill-omened
name to his daughter.

Gerald himself, meanwhile, was almost
ready to forget the little Alvar's existence.
He was ashamed of his foolish marriage,
and remorseful at its secrecy and disobedience
; the new life opened to him
by his brother's death was exceedingly
congenial. Why could not those unhappy
months be as if they had never been !
The child was of course an unfamiliar idea
to him, and except with an occasional
pang he hardly realized its existence ;
when the thought was forced on him, he
regarded it with aversion.

Three months had not, however, passed
since his wife's death, when he became
acquainted with a Miss Cheriton, a young
lady of good family and some fortune.
She was not very pretty ; but she was full
of intelligence and refinement, and she was
very good. Perhaps the force of contrast

was half the attraction. When his father
urged him to pay his addresses to Miss
Cheriton, he felt how willingly he would
have done so, but an awkward disclosure
lay between them. With all his faults he
could not be so dishonourable as to marry
her, without telling her that his heir was
already born.

But the friendship between them, so
different from anything that he had ever
known before, grew and strengthened, till
at last one evening he told her all the
story. He had married foolishly and
secretly, as far as his relations were concerned
; his wife was dead and had left a
little son. That was the story. Must it
be for ever a bar between them ? Fanny
Cheriton listened, though she was a merry,
quick-tongued girl, in silence. Then she
said that he must tell his father the whole
truth, and must acknowledge the child;
he ought to come home and be brought upas
an Englishman.

Who is to bring it up ? " asked
Gerald.

I will," said Fanny simply, amid fierce
blushes, as she saw what her answer
implied.

Thus supported, Gerald would indeed
have been a coward had he shrunk from
the communication ; but it was a great
blow to his father, who, however, was a
stronger man than his son ; and having
been satisfied that all was fair and legal,
and that Alvaro Guzman Lester was really
his lawful heir, and next to Gerald in
the entail, said shortly, 

"Fetch him home, and make an Englishman
of him if you can. What's done can't
be undone."

But when Gerald arrived at Seville,
where Don Guzman lived, and where little
Alvar had been taken, he found that by a
strange coincidence the child had at once
become of importance to his relations on
both sides. By the death of Don Guz-
man's son, Alvar had become his heir, and
when Gerald expressed a desire to take
him home, he was met by great reluctance,
and by a declaration that the child was so

delicate that a removal to a northern
climate would certainly kill him. Perhaps
Gerald's consciousness that he would not
regard the poor little fellow's death as a
misfortune, made him afraid to insist in
the face of this argument. At any rate
he returned without the child. Don Truman's
indifferentism in religion allowed
him to consent that Alvar should, when he
grew old enough, be taught the English
language and the Anglican faith, and even
showed how this might be managed by
means of an English clergyman residing at
Seville for his health ; so that he was left
with a sort of understanding that his
mother's family were to have the charge of
him for the present.

Miss Cheriton was much disappointed.

Every year will make it harder," she
said, and she resolved to use all her influence
on Alvar' s behalf. But her father-in-law's
death soon after - her marriage
deprived her of his powerful aid, and,
though his will carefully assured the succession
to his son's eldest son, she could

not contend with lier husband's distaste and
the Spanish relations' determination not to
give np the child. She had no other
troubles. Her husband shared her views
as to the duties and responsibilities of his
station, and they did much for the good of
those around them.

In spite of some harshness, Gerald was
a good landlord and a good magistrate,
and the most loving of fathers to the fair
rosy boy who was now born to them. He
never cared quite so much for the 37'ounger
ones, but 'cherry" was his delight and
pride, so pretty, so clever, and so apt at
riding his little pony, or learning to fire a
gun, and so fond of his father ! If Alvar
could but have been forgotten !

But Mrs. Lester was wise and far-seeing,
and she would not allow Cheriton to forget.
She talked to him about Alvar ; she made
him say his prayers for " my eldest brother
away in Spain ;" and she even caused him
once to write a little letter expressing his
wish to see his big brother, and to show him
his pony and his dogs. Perhaps Alvar's

education was less advanced, for there only
arrived a message of love from him in one
of the rare letters that Don Guzman indited
to Mr. Lester.

Cherry Yas rather a thoughtful child ;
his mother had succeeded in impressing
his imagination, and he thought and talked
a good deal about Alvar. One attempt
was made to bring the child to England ;
but, when he reached France, he fell ill, and
his grandfather hurried him back again,
assuring his father that it was impossible
he could live in a northern climate. Mr.
Lester was too ready to believe this.

Soon after Cheriton went to school, Mrs.
Lester died suddenly, and her loss was
greater than even Cheriton in his passion of
childish grief could guess. Grief sharpened
Mr. Lester's temper, and the loss of his
wife's influence narrowed his mind and
character. His mother, who lived with
him, and took care of the four children, did
not urge on him the need for Alvar' s return.
It ceased to be under discussion, and the
intercourse grew less and less.

Cherry, in this school life, naturally
forgot for the time to think much about
him, and at home he had a thousand
interests, some shared with his father,
some of his own. For Cheriton and Jack
inherited their mother's talent, and as they
grew up, had their minds full of many
things out of their father's ken. When
Cherry was twenty-one, his birthday was
celebrated with various festivities. He
was very popular, and the tenants drank
his health. Nature had given him a ready
tongue, and the speech he made was much
beyond the usual run of boyish eloquence.
And as he concluded, thanking them for
their kindness, he paused, and with a deep
flush, added, " And I wish my eldest
brother, who is now in Spain, was here too,
that we might know him, and that you
miofht drink his health as well as mine."

Cheriton, why did you say that ? "
said his father afterwards.

Father, I thought they would forget
Alvar's existence, and  I was afraid of
forgetting it myself."

As Clieriton spoke, it occurred to Mr.
Lester With new distinctness that he was
really doing his second son a wrong, by
allowing him to take for the time a place
which could not be his permanently. This
boy, with his ready tongue, his bright wit,
and the look in his face that his father
loved, was not his heir; was it well for
him to act as if he were so ? With a
sudden resolution he wrote his eldest son
a letter, requesting him to pay him a visit,
and make his brothers' acquaintance.

Alvar, perhaps hurt at the long neglect,
refused to do so, giving as a reason his
grandmother's serious illness, and his
father gladly let the matter drop. Cheriton
was disappointed, and asked to be
allowed to spend his next long vacation in
Spain, and to see his brother. Mr. Lester,
mindful of his own experiences, refused
decidedly ; and two years more had passed
without any serious renewal of the subject
(though Alvar' s grandmother died in a
few months), when Mr. Lester, while hunting,
had a dangerous accident, and though

he escaped comparatively iinburt, the
thought would obtrude itself, " A little
more, and my boys must have welcomed
as the head of the family an absolutely
unknown foreigner." Under the influence
of this feeling he wrote again to Alvar ina
different strain, and received a different
answer. Alvar agreed to come, and
pledged himself to remain in England fora
year, so as to have ample opportunity
of becoming acquainted with his relations,
and with the sort of life to which he was
born as an English gentleman.

CHAPTER III.

A MOTHER OF HEROES.

*' And the old grandmother sat in the chimney corner
and spun."

Alvar Lester was coming home ; but his
image was so complete a blank to his
brothers, that they could form no idea as
to how it would become them to receive
him. Jack, after lingering a little longer
by the hall fir-e, observed that he could
get nearly two hours' reading before
dinner, and went off to his usual occupations.
Cheriton's studies were, to say the
least, equally important, as he was to take
his degree in the ensuing summer; but
now he shook his head.

I can't fiddle while Some is burnings.
There's too much to think of, and I'm

tired with skating. I shall go and see
what granny has to say about it."

But when he was left alone, he still
stood leaning against the mantelpiece.
The Lesters were not a family who took
things easily, and perhaps there was not
one of them who shrank from the thought
of the strange brother as much as he who
had so persistently urged his return. Not
all his excellent arguments could cure his
own distaste to the foreigner. He was
shy too, and could not tell how to be
affectionate to a stranger, and yet he
valued the tie of relationship highly, and
could not carelessly ignore it. And he
knew that he was jealous of the very rights
of eldership on which he had just been
insisting. Which of those things that he
most valued were his own, and which
belonged to the eldest son and heir of
Oakby ? What duties and pleasures must
he give up to the new-comer ? He did not
think that any of their friends would cease
to wish to see him at their houses, even if
they included Alvar in their invitations.

Certainly lie lead a much, more powerful
voice than his brothers in the management
of the stable, and indeed of all the estate ;
but he held this privilege only by his
father's will; and probably Alvar would
ride very badly, if at all. No  that sentiment
was worthy of Bob himself ! Certainly
he could not understand English
farming, if he were only half as ignorant
of foreign countries as the clever English
undergraduate, who did not feel quite sure
if he had ever heard of any animals in
Spain but bulls and goats, and could have
sworn to nothing but grapes as a vegetable
product of the peninsula. Nor could any
stranger enter into the wants and welfare
of his father's tenants, nor be expected to
understand the schemes for the amusement
and improvement of the neighbourhood,
with which Cheriton was in the
habit of concerning himself.

How could Alvar be secretary of a
cricket club, or captain of a volunteer
corps ? No more than he could know
each volunteer and cricketer, or be known

by them, with the experience and interest
of a ife-time. " They wouldn't hear of
him," thought Cherry. He was too
young, and his father was too young, for
his thoughts to move easily forward to the
time when Alvar was to be the master ;
it was simply as elder brother that he regarded
him. " He ought to carve, and
sit at the bottom of the table when my
father's away!" And having come to
this magnificent result of so much meditation,
he laughed and shook himself, the
ludicrous side of his perplexities striking
him like a gleam of sunlight as he came to
the wise resolution of letting things settle
themselves as they came, and ran upstairs
to his grandmother.

The ground-floor of Oakby Hall consisted
of the hall, before mentioned, on
one side of which opened a billiard-room,
and on the other a large, long library, containing
a number of old books in old
editions, in which Mr. Lester took a kind
of pride, though he rarely disturbed them
in their places. There were some pictures,

VOL. I. D

dark, dingy, but bearing honoured names,
and much respected by the family as '' old
masters," though Cheriton had once got
into a great scrape by declaring that he
had lived all his life in doubt as to whether
a certain one in a corner was a portrait ora
landscape, until, one exceptionally sunny
day, he discovered it to be a fruit and
flower piece.

The room was panelled with dark oak
and fitted up with heavy carved furniture,
and curtains, which, whatever their original
tint, were now " harmonious " with
the fading of more than one generation.
Three small, deeply-recessed windows
looked out to the front, and at the end of
the long room opposite the door was a
large one facing westward, with thick
mullions and a broad, low-cushioned
window seat. This window gave its
character to the room, for through its
narrow casements miles and miles of moor
and fell were visible; a wide, wild landscape,
marked by no conspicuous peaks,
and brightened by no expanse of water.

yet with infinite variety in its cold, dark
northern colouring, and grandeur and
freedom in its apparently limitless extent.

Here was the place to watch sunset and
moonrise, or to see the storms coming up
or drifting away, and to hear them, too,
howling and whistling round the house or
dashing against the window-panes. The
west window was one of the strong influences
that moulded life at Oakby. This
library was the Lesters' ordinary living
room ; but behind it was a smaller and more
sheltered one, called Mr. Lester's study,
which he kept pretty much to himself.

The dining-room was at the other side
of the house, behind the billiard-room,
and had a view of a hill-side and fir-trees.
It contained all the modern works of art
in the house  a large picture of Mr.
Lester and his second wife, their children,
horses, and dogs, all assembled at the
front-door ; and a very stiff pink and
white, blue-eyed likeness of Cheriton in
hunting costume, which had been taken
when he came of age.
D 2



There was a fine old staircase with
wooden wolves of inferior size, but equal
ferocity, to their stone brethren without,
adorning the corners of the balustrade, and
above the library was the drawing-room,
whither Cheriton now betook himself. It
was a stiff, uninteresting room, but with
an unmistakable air of stateliness and position,
and though, like all the house, it
lacked the living charm of living taste and
arrangement, it possessed what even that
cannot always givCj and what is quite impossible
to a new home without it  a
certain air of rightness and appropriateness,
as if the furniture had grown into
its place. Still, the room, handsome as it
was, and full of things which were choicer
and more valuable than their owners knew,
was uncomfortable, the chairs were high
and the sofas were hard, and the yellow
damask, with which they were covered,
slippery ; no one had a place of his own
in it ; the wild western view gave it an
unlovely dreariness, hardly redeemed by
an extra window looking south over the

flower-garden, which in that bleak climate
would have needed more fostering care
than it ever obtained, to be very gay, even
in summer. Now of course it was snowy
and desolate.

Only in this winter weather would Mrs.
Lester have been found in her arm-chair
in the drawing-room; but an attack of
rheumatism had recently reminded her of
her seventy years, and obliged her to remain
in the house, at any rate till the frost
was over. She had lived with her son
ever since his second wife's death, and
had kept his house, and in a manner presided
over the education of his children ;
but though she was the only woman of
the family, and an old woman and a grandmother,
it was not from her that the boys
looked for spoiling tenderness, nor were
the softer and sweeter elements of the
family life, few as they were, fostered by
her influence.

She had handed down to lier children,
and still exhibited herself, their height
and vigorous strength, and perhaps something

of their beauty, though she was a
darker and more aquiline-featured person
than her son, who resembled his father.
Whether the grandchildren inherited her
clear, but narrow vision, her upright, but
prejudiced mind, and her will, that went
its way subject to no side lights or
shadows, perhaps it was early days to tell.
she was an entirely unintellectual, unimaginative
person ; but within her experience,
which was extremely limited  as
she could hardly realize, the existence,
inch less the merits of natures unlike her
own  she had a good deal of shrewd
sense, and it was much easier to feel her
strictures unjust than to prove them so.

She had a thorough knowledge of, and
had all her life been accustomed to share
m, the out-door sports and occupations of
country life, and very recently had been
able to ride and drive with the skill of
long practice. These had been the pleasures
of her youth ; but though she was
rather an unfeminine woman, she had
never been in any sense a fast one. She

was altogether devoid of coquettish instincts,
and though she had been a handsome
girl, who had passed her life almost
entirely among sporting men, and whose
tongue was in consequence somewhat free,
she had hardly left through the countryside
the memory even of an old flirtation.

Within doors she had few occupations ;
but when her daughter-in-law's death
rendered her presence at Oakby again
necessary, she had taken the command of
the children, and ruled them vigorously
according to her lights. She wished to see
them grow up after her ideal, and would
have despised them utterly if they had
gambled, drunk, or dissipated their property
by extravagance. She would have
thought very slightingly of them if their
taste had been exclusively for an indoor
or studious life, or if they had been
awkward riders or bad shots, though she
recognized the duty of " attention to their
studies " in moderation, particularly on
wet days.

She was tolerably satisfied with her

grandsons, who had imbibed this view
of life with the smell of the heather
and the pines, but she was a little suspicious
of the Cheriton blood, and of the
talents of which she had succeeded in
making Cherry and Jack half ashamed.
Perhaps her granddaughter was her favourite,
and she rejoiced in the girl's love
for an out-door life, and certainly did not
discourage the outrageous idleness with
which Nettie neglected the lessons she was
supposed to learn of the governess at
Oakby Rectory.

On the present occasion Cheriton found
her in an unusually thoughtful mood. Her
bright dark eyes were still so strong that
she rarely used glasses; nor did she often
give in to wearing a shawl ; but her dress,
which was scrupulously appropriate to her
age and circumstances  handsome black
silk, and soft white cap fastened under her
chin  had an oddly inappropriate air on
her tall, upright figure, and strong, marked
features.

Well, granny, so he's really coming,"

said Clieriton cheerfully, as lie sat down
opposite to her.

"Oh, your father's been here," said Mrs.
Lester. '* We'll have to do with him for a
year, I suppose."

Oh, we'll get on with him somehow.
I mean to strike up a friendship," returned
Cherry boldly.

You'll be very soft if you do. Your
father and I, remember, know what these
Spaniards are like ; they're a bad lot  a
bad lot."

'' Well, my father ought to know  certainly
! But you see he has told us so
little about them."

I have told my son that 1 think he
couldn't have chosen a worse time to have
him home  just when you lads are all
growing up, and ready to learn all the
tricks he can teach you."

"What tricks ?" said Cheriton, feeling
much insulted by the suggestion.

D'ye think I'm going to teach you
beforehand ? "

I assure you, granny," said Cheriton

impressively, " that the tricks I see at Oxford
are such that it would be impossible
for Alvar to beat them."

And what have you been up to now ? '*
said his grandmother sharply.

'' Why, granny, I really shouldn't like
to tell you the half of them. But I'm
quite accustomed to 'tricks,' a monkey
couldn't be more used to them. There
was that affair with the chapel door  "

Oh, don't tell me your monkey tricks,"
said his grandmother, with half-humorous
indignation. " 1 know what they lead to ;
they're bad enough. But your half-brother
will smoke like a chimney and drink like
a fish, and gamble before the lads on
a Sunday. If those are your Oxford
manners  "

Really," said Cheriton seriously, '' we
have no reason to suppose that he will do
anything of the kind ; and if he did, the boys
are very little in the mood to imitate him.
I only hope they'll be decently civil to him."

Mrs. Lester was herself a much cooler and
more imperturbable person than any of her

descendants ; but she was often the cause
of irritation in others, from a calm persistency
that ignored all arguments and
refutation ; and she was especially apt to
come across Cheriton, whom she did not
regard with the admiration due from a
loving grandmother to a dutiful, handsome
grandson.

"It's a great misfortune, as I always
told my son it would be. You, Cherry, are
fond of strangers and outlandish ways, so
maybe he'll suit you."

Well, granny, I hope he may, and
we'll get you to come and light our pipes
for us," said Cherry, keeping his temper.
But the coaxing sweetness that made him
the one non-conductor of quarrels in a sufficiently
stormy household, was apparently
lost, for Mrs. Lester went on, 

'' He'll suit the Seytons better than he'll
suit us."

There's nothing to say against the
Seytons noio,'' said Cheriton hotly; muttering
under his breath, " I hate prejudice."

Mr. Lester's entrance interrupted the

discussion, though a long story of a
broken fence between his property and
Mr. Sey ton's did not give it a smoother
turn.

As Mr. Sey ton's fences had been in a
disgraceful condition for at least as long
as Cheriton could remember, he was well
aware that the present grievance was only
an outlet for a deeper seated one, but his
grandmother struck in, 

Ah, Cheriton may see what it is to
take to bad ways and bad connexions.
I've been telling him his half-brother is
likely enough to make friends with the
Seytons, and bring their doings over
here."

With a couple of boys younger than
Jack," cried Cheriton. " Any one would
think, granny, that we had a deadly feud
with the Seytons."

'* I'll not hear the matter discussed,"
loudly interposed Mr. Lester. " Hold
your tongue, Cherry. Alvar will have
to mind what he is about. I'm sick
of the sound of this name. If lie had a

good English one of his own it would be
something."

Why hasn't he, then ? " was on the
tip of Cherry's tongue, but he suppressed
it ; and as his grandmother walked away,
saying that it was time to dress for dinner,
he got up and stood near his father.

'* I say, dad, never mind ; we'll get
along somehow," he said.
 The expression of passionate irritation
passed out of Mr. Lester's face, and was
succeeded by a look of regretful affection
as he put his hand on his favourite son's
shoulder.

"I'd give half I'm worth, my boy, to
undo it. It's a wrong to you. Cherry a
wrong. It gives me no pleasure to think
of the place in his hands after I'm gone."

*' Father," interposed Cheriton firmly,
'* the only wrong is in speaking of it so.
It is no wrong to any of us. And you
know," he added shyly and under his
breath, " mamma would never let us think
so."

Mr. Lester was a person who would not

endure a touch on his tenderest feelings.
He had never mentioned the young wife,
whose word had been his law, to the son
whom he adored for her sake, and who
influenced his violent yet impressionable
nature by the inheritance of hers. That influence
led him to listen to the words which
he could not controvert ; but he did not love
his unknown son the better for the pain
which this defence of him had cost him.
Clieriton felt that he had ventured almost
too far, and he turned off the subject after
a pause, by saying quaintly, 

'' I wonder what the fox thinks of it
all."

What d'ye mean ? "

Don't you remember that old lady who
came to see granny once, and when Jack
and I raved about a day's hunting, would
say nothing but 'I wonder what the fox
thinks of it all ? ' That was making the
other side much too important, wasn't
it?"

'' Ah, you're ready with your jokes,"
said his father, not wishing to follow out

the little fable, but with a daily sense of
liking for the voice and smile with which
it was uttered. " Come, I'll have a pipe
with you before dinner."

CHAPTER IV.

STRANGERS YET !

'* My mother came from Spain . . .
And I am Spanish in myself
And in my likings."

It was late on the afternoon of Christmas
Eve. The hall at Oakby was full of
branches of holly and ivy. Nettie, perched
on the top of an oak cabinet, was sticking
sprays into the frame of her grandfather's
picture, and Jack and Bob were arranging,
according to time-honoured custom, a
great bunch of bright-berried holly over
the mantelpiece, to do which in safety was
a work unattainable by feminine petticoats.

"It's a great shame of Cherry not to
come in time to help," said Nettie.

They'll have got hold of him down at

the cliurcli," said Jack. " There, that's
first-rate."

''I say, Jack, do you know Virginia
Seyton came home yesterday ? Isn't it
finny that they should have one too ?"

"One what?"

 Why, a relation, a sister, when we've
got a brother. I wonder  "

Suddenly Nettie stopped, as a crash of
wheels sounded on the frosty gravel, and
the front door bell pealed loudly.

Oh, Jack ! " and Nettie jumped off the
cabinet at one bound, six feet high though
it was, and caught hold of the end of
Jack's coat in a perfect agony of shyness.
Oh, let's run away ! "

Let go. I can't get down. Stand still
and don't be silly," said Jack, gruffly, ashe
got off the steps, while the butler hurried
forward and threw open the door. Nettie
stood in the fire-light, her golden hair
flying in the gust of wind, her hands together,
like a wild thing at bay. Bob remained
perched, half way up the ladder,
and Jack made a step or two forward.

VOL. I. E

A tall figure in a dark cloak, with bright
crimson lining, and a large felt list, stood
in the doorway.

Are you Cheriton ? " he said eagerly,
and with a strong foreign accent.

No ; he's out. I'm Jack. How d'ye
do ? We didn't know when you were
coming," said Jack, in a tone from which
embarrassment took every shade of cordiality.
He put out his hand quickly,
however, as the stranger made a movement
as if possibly intending a more tender
salutation. Alvar took it, then removed
his list, and advancing towards the speechless
Jettie said, 

'' This is my sister ? May I not salute
her?" and lightly touched her cheek with
his lips. "I have thought of you, my
sister," he said.

Have you?" stammered Nettie, hanging
down her head like a child. Bob
remained motionless on his ladder, and
Jack said, 

'* Here's my father," as Mr. Lester came
hurriedly into the hall, nearly as much

embarrassed as his children, and pale with
an agitation which they did not share.
Alvar turned round, and bowed low with a
respectful grace that his brothers certainly
could not have imitated.

Mr. Lester came forward and held out
his hand. It needed all his innate sense of
good breeding to overcome the repulsion
which the very idea of his strange son
caused him. The sense of owing him
amends for long-neglected duty, the knowledge
how utterly out of place this foreigner
must be as heir of Oakby, the feeling that
by so recognizing him he was wronging
alike his forefathers and his other children,
while he yet knew how much his whole life
through he had wronged Alvar himself,
came upon him with renewed force. Then
as he heard such tones, and saw such a face
as he had not seen for years, what rush of
long past sentiment, what dead and buried
love and hate came rushing over him
with such agitating force, that in the
effort to avoid a scene, and a display
of feeling which, yielded to, might have
E 2

UBRARV

smoothed the relations between them forever,
his greeting to his son was as cold
as ice !

How do you do, Alvar ? I am glad to
see sou. We did not expect you so soon.
You must have found your journey very
cold."

'' I did not delay. It was my wish to
see my father," said Alvar, a little wistfully.
My father, I trust, will find me a dutiful
son."

Here Bob giggled, and Jack nearly
knocked him off the ladder with the
nudge evoked by his greater sense of
propriety.

No doubt  no doubt," said Mr. Lester.
I hope we shall understand each other,
soon. Where's Cheriton ? Jack, suppose
you show  him  your brother, his room.
Dinner at seven, you know. I daresay
you're hungry."

I did take a cup of coffee, but it was
not good," said Alvar, as he followed Jack
upstairs ; and the latter, mortally afraid of
a Ute-tete, shut him into the bedroom

prepared for him, and rushed downstairs
to encounter Cheriton, who came hurrying
in, thinking himself late for dinner.

Cherry, he's come ! "

Oh, Cherry, he's so queer ! He makes
pretty speeches, and he bows ! "

He's a regular nigger, he's so black ! "

Oh, Cherry, it's aivfull "

'' What have you done with him ?
Where's the squire ? " said Cherry, as soon
as he could make himself heard.

*' Oh, papa has seen him, and Jack's
taken him into his room," said Nettie.

*' He thought 1 was you," said Jack.

Cheriton stood still for a moment, as
shy as the rest, then, with an effort, he ran
upstairs.

'rit's only kind to go and say how d'ye
do to a fellow," he thought, as he tapped
at the bedroom door, and entered with
outstretched hand, and blushing to the
tips of his ears. " Oh, how d'ye do? I'm
so sorry I was out of the way ; they kept
me to nail up the wreaths. I'm very glad
to see you. Aren't you very cold? "

Probably the foreigner understood about
half of this lucid and connected greeting ;
but something in the warmth of the tone
made him come forward eagerly.

You are then really my brother Cheriton
? I thought it was again the other
one."

'' What, Jack ? Yes, we're thought alike,
I believe."

I do not see that," said Alvar, contemplating
him gravely; "but I have
known you in my thoughts  always."

"I'm sure  we've all thought a great
deal about you. But there's no one to
help you. Have you got your things ? I'll
ring," nearly pulling down the bell-rope.
And, look here, I'll just dress and come
back, and go down with you  shall I ? "

Cheriton's summons was rapidly answered,
as curiosity inspired the servants
as well as their masters ; and leaving Alvar
to make his toilet, he hastened upstairs.
The three brothers slept in a long passage
at the top of the house, over the drawing-room.
As Cherry's step sounded, both

his brothers' doors burst open simultaneously,
and Jack and Bob, in various
stages of dressing, at once ejaculated, 
"Well!"

How can I tell ? It's awfully late. I
shall never be ready," and Cherry banged
his own door, too much astounded by the
new brother to stand a discussion on him.
As soon as he was ready he went downstairs,
and found Alvar, rather to his
relief, attired in correct evening costume.


I suppose you haven't seen my grandmother
yet ? " he said.

Your grandmother ? I did not know
there was a grandmother," said Alvar, ina
much puzzled voice, which, together with
the sense of how much his brother had to
learn, nearly upset Cherry's gravity.

'' My father's mother, you know. She
lives with us," he said. " She is your
grandmother too."

Ah ! " said Alvar, " I loved my grandmother
much. This other one, she will be
most venerable, I am sure."

Come along then," said Cherry, unable
to stand more conversation at present.

Mrs. Lester, whatever her private opinions
might be, had too much respect for
the heir, for herself, and for the house of
Lester, not to attire herself with unusual
dignity, and to rise and advance to receive
her grandson.

'how do you do, Alvar?" she said.
You have been a long time in coming to
see us."

Alvar, after a moment's pause, as if
doubtful what sort of salutation would be
acceptable, bowed low and kissed her
hand. Nettie laughed; but her grandmother
drew herself up as if the act of
homage was not altogether displeasing to
her, and then looked keenly at the new
grandson, who, as far as looks went,
was no unworthy scion of the handsome
Lesters.

He was as tall as his father, though of
a different and slighter make, and stood
with a sort of graceful stiffness, unlike the
easy loose-limbed air of most young English

gentlemen. He had a dark olive skin,
and oval face ; but his features were not
unlike the prevailing family type; and
though his hair was raven black, it grew
and curled in the picturesque fashion of
his father's, which Cheriton alone of the
other sons inherited. But he had the
splendid black liquid eyes, with blue whites,
and slender arched eyebrows of his Spanish
mother, and possessed a picturesque foreign
beauty that seemed to group the fair-haired
brothers into a common-place herd.
He had a grave, impassive face, and held
his head up with an air suggestive of
Spanish grandees.

It was very difficult to make conversation
when they went in to dinner, the more
so as Alvar evidently did not easily follow
rapid English, and either he was bewildered
by new impressions, or not very
open to them, for he had not much to say
about his journey. Cheriton, as he tried
to talk as if there was no perplexing
stranger present, could not help wondering
whether all that was so strange to himself

came with any familiarity to his father.
Had he known what his son would belike
? Could he touch any chord to which
Alvar could find a response ? Had eyes
like those great rolling black ones ever
looked love into his own ? And if so, was
it all forgotten, or was the remembrance
distasteful ?

He was older than I am nov," thought
Cherry. " Surely the thoughts of to-day
could never fade away entirely."

Mr. Lester uttered no word that betrayed
any knowledge of his son's country. He
spoke less than usual, and after due inquiries
for Alvar' s relations, entirely on
local matters ; Alvar volunteered few
remarks, but as the dessert appeared, he
turned to Cherry, who sat beside him, and
said, 

"Is it not now the custom to smoke ? "

Not at dinner," said Cherry hurriedly,
as his father replied, 

Certainly not," and all the bright
blue eyes round the table stared at Alvar,
who for the first time coloured, and said,  

Pardon, I have transgressed."

We'll go and have a pipe presently,"
said Cherry ; and oh ! how ardently he
longed for that terrible evening to be over.

It was a liorricl Christmas Eve," muttered
Nettie to Bob ; and perhaps her
father thought so too, for he rang the bell
early for prayers.

"What is this?" said Alvar, looking
puzzled, as a prayer-book was placed before
him.

< We're going to have prayers," said
Nettie, rather pertly. " Don't you ? "

Ah, it is a custom," said Alvar, and he
took the book, and stood and knelt as they
did, evidently watching for his cue.

When this ceremony was over. Bob and
Nettie rushed off, evidently to escape saying
good-night, and Cheriton invited the
stranger to come and smoke with him,
conducting him to a little smoking-room
downstairs, which was only used for
visitors, as the boys generally smoked ina
room at the top of the house, into
which Cherry knew Bob and Jack would

greatly resent any intrusion. Mr. Lester
walked off with a general good-night.
Alvar watched Cherry kiss his grandmother,
but contented himself with a bow.
Jack discreetly retired, and when Cheriton
had ascertained that Alvar never smoked
a pipe, but only a cigar or a cigarette, and
had made him sit down by the fire, Alvar
said; 

"My father is then a member of the
clerical party ? "

I don't think I quite understand you,"
said Cherry.

Your prayers  she is religious ? "

Oh, most people have prayers  I don't
think we're more particular than others.
My father and Mr. Ellesmere, our rector,
are friends, naturally," said Cherry, feeling
it very difficult to explain himself.

My grandfather," said Alvar, " is
indifferent."

But  you're a Protestant, aren't you ? "

Oh, yes. I have been so instructed.
But I do not interest myself in the
subject."

Cheriton had heard many odd things
at Oxford said about religion, but never anything
to equal the naivete of this avowal.
He was quite unprepared with a reply,
and Alvar went on, 

I shall of course conform. I am not
an infidel; but I leave those things to
your  clergy, do you not call them ? "

'' Well, some people would say you were
right," said Cherry, thankful that Jack
was not present to assert the inalienable
right of private judgment.

And politics ? " said Alvar ; " I know
about your Tories and your Whigs. On
which side do you range yourself ? "

*' Well, my father's a Tory and High
Churchman, which I suppose is what you
mean by belonging to the clerical party ;
and I  if all places were like this  I'd like
things very well as they are. Jack, however,
vNTOuld tell you we were going fast to
destruction."

There are then dissensions among
you?"

Oh, he'll come round to something, I

dare sap. But our English politics must
seem mere child's play to you."

'' I have taken no dart," said Alvar.
 My grandfather would conform to anything
for peace, and I, you know, my
brother, am in Spain an Englishman 
though a Spaniard here."

"" I hope you'll be an Englishman soon."

'rit is the same with marriage," said
Alvar ; "I have never betrothed myself,
nor has my grandfather sought to marry
me. He said I must see English ladies
also. One does nob always follow the
heart in these matters," he concluded
rather sentimentally.

No one would ever dream of your
following anything else," said Cherry,
beginning gruffly, but half choked with
amusement as he spoke.

No ? And you, you have not decided ?
Ah, you blush, my brother; I am indiscreet."


I didn't blush  at least that's nothing.
Turkey-cock was my nickname at school
always," said Cherry hastily.

I do not understand," said Alvar; and
after Cherry had explained the nature and
character of turkey-cocks, he said, '' But I
think that was not civil."

Civil ! It wasn't meant to be. English
boys don't stand much upon civility. But,"
he added, as he knocked the ashes out of
his joie, " if we are rough, I hope you
won't mind ; the boys don't mean any
harm by it. You'll soon get used to our
ways, and  and we'll do our best to make
you feel at home with us."

A sudden sense of pity for the lonely
brother, a stranger in his father's house,
softened Cheriton's face and voice as he
spoke, though he felt himself to be promising
a good deal.

Alvar looked at him with the curious,
impassive, unembarrassed air that distinguished
him. *' You are not ' rough ! ' "
he said ! '' you are my brother. I am told
that here you do not embrace each other.
I am an Englishman, I give you my
hand."

Cheriton took the slender, oval-shaped

hand, which yet closed on his more angular
one, with a firm, vigorous grasp.

"All right," he said; "you'd better ask
me if you don't know what to do. And
now I think you must be tired. I'll
show you sour room. I hope you won't
mind the cold much ; I am sorry it's so
frosty."

Oh, the cold is absolutely detestable,
but I am not tired," said Alvar briskly.

It was more than Cheriton could say, ashe
shut this perplexing brother into the
best bedroom, which he could not associate
with anything but a state visit. He
felt oppressed with a sense of past and
future responsibility, of distaste which he
knew was mild compared to what every
other member of his family would experience,
of contempt, and kindliness and pity,
and, running through all, the exceeding
ludicrousness, from an Oakby point of
view, of some of Alvar's remarks.

This latter ingredient in his perplexity
was strengthened, when he got upstairs,
by Jack, who, detecting his dispirited look,

proceeded to encourage him by remarking
solemnly, 

'' Well, I consider it a great family misfortune.
Dispositions and habits that are
entirely incongruous can't be expected to
agree."

Do shut up, Jack ; you're not writing
an essay. Now I see where Alvar's turn
for speechifying comes from ; you get it
somehow from the same stock ! All I
know is, it's too bad to be down on a
fellow when he's cast on our hands like
this. Now I am going to bed, I'm tired to
death ; and if we're late on Christmas
morning, we shall never hear the last
of it."

While the young brothers thus discussed
this strange disturber of their accustomed
life, their father's thoughts were still more
perplexing. He had so long put aside the
unwelcome thought of his eldest son that
he felt inclined to regard his presence
with incredulity. Surely this dark, stately
stranger could have no concern with his
beloved homestead with its surrounding

VOL. I. r

moors and fells. This boy had never
ridden by his side, nor taken his first shots
from his gun, nor differed from him about
the management of his estate.

Oakby, with all its duties and pleasures,
had no connexion with him; and with
Oakby Mr. Lester had for many years felt
himself to be wholly identified. But those
dark eyes, those slow, soft accents, that air
so strange to his sons, awoke memories of
another self. He saw Cher ton's puzzled
attempt at understanding the strange
brother. But this strange son was not
strange to him. He knew the very turns
of expression that Alvar's imperfect English
suggested. For the first time for
years the Spanish idioms and Spanish
words came back to his memory. He
could have so talked as to set his son in
accordance with his surroundings, he understood,
to his own surprise, exactly
where this very new shoe would pinch.

But these memories, though fresh and
living, were utterly distasteful, and nothing
that cost him pain awoke in Mr. Lester's

mind any answering tenderness. He was
a man with a weak will, a careful conscience,
and imperfectly controlled temper
and affections.

He much preferred to do right than todo
wrong, and he generally did do right ;
in this one crucial instance he had neglected
and slurred over the right thing for years,
and now he was not sufficiently accustomed
to question himself to realize how
far he could have made amends for past
neglect, how far he could now make his
son fit for the heirship of which he neither
could nor would deprive him. No, Alvar
was a painful sight to him, therefore he
would continue to ignore him as far as
possible. He stood in the beloved Cheriton's
light, and therefore all the small
difficulties that his incongruous presence
caused would be left to Cheriton to set to
rights, or not be set to rights at all.

It was pleasant, and it was not very

difficult to Mr. Lester, as he woke in the

light of the Christmas dawn, to turn his

mind from Alvar's presence to the many

F 2

duties that the season demanded of him.
The children all woke up curious and half-unfriendly.
Cheriton wondered what Alvar
was thinking of. But they none of them
knew to what thoughts or feelings the
pealing, crashing Christmas bells awoke
the unknown heir.

Nay, you'll know no more what he's
after than if he was yonder picture,"
said the grandmother in answer to some
remarks, and as Cheriton heard him coming
down stairs he felt that this was exactly
the state of the case.

CHAPTER V.

THE Seasons OF ELDEKTHWArTB.

"All things here are out of joint."

In the midst of a waste of unwept snow
across the bill behind Oakby Hall, there
was a large old house, originally of something
the same square and substantial
type, but of more ambitious architecture,
for there were turrets at the four corners,
overgrown and almost borne down by
enormous bushes of ancestral ivy ; while
the great gates leading to the stables were
of fanciful and beautiful ironwork, now
broken and falling into decay. Great tree-trunks
lay here and there on undulating
slopes, the shrubberies flung wild branches
over the low stone wall dividing them
from the park, where a gate swung weakly

on its hinges. There were few tall trees,
but here and there along the drive a solitary
beech of great size and beauty suggested
the course of an avenue once without
its equal in the country round. An
old man was feebly sweeping away the
snow in front of the house, and a gentleman
stood smoking a cigar on the steps 
a slenderly-made man, with a delicate,
melancholy face, and a pointed grey beard,
dressed in a shabby shooting-coat. His
eyes turned from the slow old sweeper,
past the relics of the avenue, to a ruinous-looking
lodge, the chimneys of which sent
no smoke into the frosty air.

Mr. Seyton of Elderthwaite was used to
these signs of adversity, but to-day he
was struck by them anew, for he was wondering
how they would look in the eyes of
a stranger. Oakby, with its strict laws,
its rough humours, its ready-made life,
would be a strange experience to its foreign
heir. What would Elderthwaite, with
ruined fortunes and blighted reputation be
to a petted and prosperous girl, brought

up by gentle, religious women, in all the
proprieties and liabilities of well-to-do
country villa life ? What would his
daughter say to the home she had left as a
child, and had never seen since ?

The Seytons were a family of older
standing in the county than the Lesters,
and had once been of superior fortune.
At present their condition was, and rightly,
very different. The Lesters, with many
shortcomings, had been men who, on the
whole, had endeavoured to do their duty
in their station, and had governed their
tenants, brought up their children, attended
to public business, and managed their own
affairs in an honest and right-minded, if not
always in a very enlightened fashion.

But the Seytons had had a bad name
for generations. It is true that no tales
of wild and picturesque wickedness were
told of the present head of the house, such
as had made his father's name a bye-word
for harshness and violence, and for all
manner of evil living; but the family
traditions were strong against him ; he

inherited debt and a dishonoured name,
and, alas ! with them the tendencies and
temptations that had brought them about.
He had looked with bitter, injured eyes
at the timber that was sold for his father's
gaming debts; but many a noble tree fell
to pay his own, before he married a girl,
innocent, high-minded, and passionate-tempered.


It was a very unhappy marriage, and
Mr. Seyton never forgave his wife for her
broken heart, nor himself for breaking it.
When she died, her relations took away
her daughter, pledging themselves to provide
for her, if she were left undisturbed
in their hands. The father had enough todo
with his sons. The eldest, Roland,
was a fine, handsome fellow, and began
life with the sad disadvantage of being expected
to go wrong. He got a commission,
but during the short intervals that he
spent at home, was personally unpopular.

In one of these he took a great fancy to
Cheriton Lester during an interval between
the latter's school and college life, and

Cheriton being warned against bim as a
bad companion, stuck to him with equal
perverseness and generosity. Roland was
much the elder of the two, but Cherry's
vigorous youth took the lead in the friendship,
and gave it his own impress. It was
ended by such a scandal in Elderthwaite
village as those which had made the name
of Roland Sey ton's grandfather hated by
all the country round, as one by whom no
man's hearth was respected, and with
whom no man's daughter was safe.

The discovery shocked Cheriton unspeakably
; all the parties concerned were
well known to him, and he felt that of
such sins he could never think or speak
lightly. But he would not join in loud or
careless blame of his friend, who perhaps
felt his truest pang of repentance at the
boy's confused miserable face in the one
parting interview allowed by Mr. Lester
before Roland joined his regiment, about
to sail for India.

You need not have been afraid, sir,"
Roland said, when accused of having set

him a bad example; "I knew low to
choose my confidant."

After Roland's departure, other tales to
his discredit, and debts which it was impossible
to pay, came to his father's ears,
and these additional troubles helped to
strengthen habits of self-indulgence already
formed, which had made Mr. Seyton a
man old before his time, melancholy-faced
and gentle-mannered, whom nobody respected
and nobody disliked. But the
two younger boys had a bad start in life,
and seemed little likely to redeem the
family fortunes.

It was not often that Mr. Seyton thought
of anything but the immediate dulness and
discomfort of the hour, or of its small
alleviations ; but to-day these recollections
pressed on him. He thought, too, of his
shabby furniture, and his ill-conducted
household ; how unfit a home for his well-towered
daughter ; how unlike both her
aunt's house and the pleasant foreign tour
which, since her aunt's death, she had
been enjoying.

'papa, papa!" cried a bright voice
behind him, " Good morning," then as he
timed round, the newly-arrived daughter
exclaimed, throwing her arms round his
neck, " Oh, how nice it is to say ' Good
morning, papa ! ' "

She was a fair creature enough, a true
Seyton, with slender frame and pointed
chin, creamy complexion and rich brown
hair, but the large, round eyes, tender,
intense, and full of life, were her mother's,
though clear and untroubled as the mother's
had never been.

So you are glad to come home,
Virginia ? " said her father, rather sadly.

Yes, papa, 1 am just delighted. I
always made stories about home when I
was at Littleton. I was very happy, you
know, with dear Aunt Mary and all my
friends ; but it was so uninteresting not to
know more of my very nearest relations."

You will find it very different, my
dear, from what you are accustomed to.
This is a dull place."

Oh, papa, I think it is so silly to be

dull ! I shall be quite ready to like anything
you wish," said Virginia warmly.

My dear, you shall take your own way.
It would be hard at least if I could not
give you that," said Mr. Seyton, looking
at her as if he did not quite know what todo
with this gaily-dressed, frank-spoken
daughter. '' Now let us come to breakfast."


"I am afraid I am late," said Virginia;
but it is never easy to be in time after a
journey."

You are punctual for this house, my
dear ; we take such things easy. But
your aunt is down, you see, in your
honour." As Mr. Seyton spoke they came
into the dining-room, a long, low room,
with treasures of curious carving round
its oak panels, hardly visible in its imperfect
light.

A lady sat pouring out the tea. She
had the delicate features and peculiar complexion
of her family, but her eyes, instead
of being like Mr. Seyton's, vague and sad,
were sharp and sarcastic ; she had more

play of feature, and, though she looked fully
her age, had the air of having been a beauty.

Miss Seyton had once been engaged to
be married, but her engagement had been
broken off in one of the storms of discreditable
trouble that had overwhelmed
her father and brothers, no one knew
exactly how or why. She had never
married, and had lived ever since With her
brother, not always without scandal and
remark. Still her presence had kept
Elderthwaite on the visiting-list of the
county, and made it possible for her niece
to live there.

In spite of her sharp, eager eyes, she
had an indescribable laziness and nonchalance
of manner, and poured out the
tea as if it was an effort beyond her. The
boys' places remained vacant. There was
a little talk at breakfast-time, but it did
not flow easily. Virginia would have had
plenty to say, but she had a sense that what
she did say caused her aunt inward surprise
or amusement, and she began to feel shy.

When the meal was over, Mr. Seyton

sauntered away slowly, and Virginia said,
Do we sit in the drawing-room in the
morning. Aunt Julia ? "

Yes, as often as not," said Miss Seton.
" You are welcome to arrange all
such matters for yourself. Girls have
ways of their own."

'' I don't want to have any strange or
uncomfortable ways, auntie," said Virginia
; " I want to feel quite at home, and
to be useful."

'' Useful ! " said Miss Seyton. " What's
your notion of being useful ? "

She did not speak unkindly, but with a
curious sort of inward amusement, as if
the notions of the bright-eyed girl were an
odd study to her.

I'm afraid I haven't very clear notions.
I want to make it cheerful for papa  Aunt
Mary always said he wasn't strong or welland
perhaps the boys want things done for
them ; my friends' brothers always did,"
said Virginia a little pathetically.

There's one thing, my dear, I wish you
to understand at once. I shall never interfere

with you ; but I don't mean to
abdicate in your favour. I keep house 
whatever house is kept  and you'd better
shut your eyes and ears to it. It isn't
work for you."

Oh, Aunt Julia ! " said Virginia distressed,
*' I would not think of such a
thing. It is your place."

No, my dear, it's not ; but I mean to
stick to it," interposed Miss Seyton.

"And I know nothing about housekeeping,
I'm afraid. I should be very
extravagant."

Like a true Seyton. So much for
that, then. And now another thins.
Don't you ever give your brothers so much
as a half-sovereign secretly. You have
money, and they know it, and it's scarce
here. Mind what I say."

A kind of puzzled sense of something
that she did not understand crossed Virginia's
face.

I would rather give them things than
money," she said. " Of course papa lets
them have what is right."

'' Of course," said Miss Seyton, with the
same perplexing expression of indescribable
amusement.

A good joke had for years been the
solace, a bitter sarcasm the natural outlet,
of a life which certainly had been neither
prosperous nor happy in itself, nor glorified
by any martyrdom of self-denial.

Miss Seyton was full ol malice, both in
the French and English acceptations of
the word. She loved fun, and she could
not see without bitterness the young, unworn
creature beside her. To astonish
Virginia offered an almost irresistible
temptation to both these tendencies. Her
evident unconsciousness of the life that
lay before her, was at once so funny, and
such a cruel satire on them all.

"So you built castles in the air about
your relations ? " she said, with an odd
longing to knock some of these castles
down.

Sometimes," said Virginia ; 'then Ruth
told mo about you ; and two years ago she
and I met Cberiton Lester and his cousin

Rupert in London, and I used to talk to
them, Clieriton made me wish to come
home very much."

*' Why ? " said Miss Seyton shortly.

He used to tell her about the place,
and he made me remember much better
what it was like."

Heritor will have to play second
fiddle. The eldest brother is coming back
from Spain."

Ah, I remember, he told us how much
he wished it. Oh, and he told me Uncle
James ' wasn't half a bad fellow.' I suppose
that was a boy's way of saying he
was very nice indeed. Perhaps I can help
him, too, in the village. I like school-teaching,
and I suppose there aren't many
young ladies in Elderthwaite ? "

You little innocent ! " exclaimed Miss
Seyton. Then, moving away, she said, in
the same wicked undertone, '* Well, you
had better ask him."

Virginia remained standing by the fire.
She felt ruffled, for she knew herself to be
laughed at, and not having the clue to her

VOL. 1. (i

aunt's meaning, she fancied that her free
and easy mention of Cheriton had excited
the remark ; and being a young lady of
decided opinions and somewhat warm
temper, made up her mind silently, but
with energy, that she would never like her
Aunt Julia, never ! She had been taken
away from home when only eleven years
old, and since then had only occasionally
seen her father and her brothers. Her
cousin Ruth, who had frequently stayed at
Elderthwaite, had never bestowed on her
much definite information; and perhaps
the season in London and the renewal of
her childish acquaintance with Cheriton
Lester had done more than anything else
to revive old impressions.

She had been most carefully brought
up by her aunt. Lady Hampton, with
every advantage of education and influence.
Companions and books were all carefully
chosen, and her aunt hoped to see her
married before there was any chance of
her returning to Elderthwaite. But such
was the dread of the reckless, defiant.

Seyton nature, that her very precautions
defeated their wishes.

Virginia never was allowed to be intimate
with any young man but Cheriton,
who at the time of their meeting was a
mere boy, and with thoughts turned in
another direction ; and though Virginia
was sufficiently susceptible, with a nature
at once impetuous and dependent, she
came home at one-and-twenty, never yet
having seen her ideal in flesh and blood.

"Duties enough, and little cares," had
filled her girlhood, and delightful girl
friendships and girl reverences had occupied
her heart ; while her time had
been filled by her studies, the cheerful
gaieties of a lively neighbourhood, and by
the innumerable claims of a church and
parish completely organized and vigorously
worked.

Lady Hampton was one of the Ladies
Bountiful of Littleton ; and Virginia had
taught in the schools, made tea at the
treats, worked at church decorations, and
made herself useful and important in all
G 2

the ways usual to a clever, warm-hearted
girl under such influences. And with the
same passionate fervour of nature, and the
same necessity to her life of an approving
conscience, which had made her mother's
heart beat itself to death against the bars
of her unsatisfying home, Virginia's nature
had flowed on in perfect tune with her
surroundings ; till, when she was nearly
twenty, came the great grief of her kind
aunt's death, leaving her heiress to a
moderate fortune. By the terms of the
will she was to travel under carefully
selected guardianship till she was of age,
and then to choose whether she would go
home to her father, or have a home made
for her at Littleton.

Virginia chose promptly, and then, in
the delicate, indefinite language of those
who fear to do harm by every word, was
warned of difficulties. Much would be
painful to her, much would be strange ;
her home was not like anything she had
been used to. She listened and looked
sad, and understood nothing of what they

meant to imply ; and thus ready to admire,
but with only one type in her mind of
what was admirable ; full of love, but with
none of the blinding softening memories
that make love easy, she came to a home
where admiration was impossible, and love
would demand either ignorant indifference
to any high ideal, or a rare and perfect
charity, alike unknown to a high-minded
iD tolerant girl.

CHAPTER A.

VIRGINIA.
A sense of mystery her spirit daunted."

The vicar of Eldertliwaite was Mr. Seyton's
youngest brother. There had been one
between them, the father of the Ruth
mentioned in the last chapter, but he had
married well, and died early, leaving this
one girl, who lived with her grandmother,
and paid occasional visits to Elderthwaite.
James Seyton had been the wildest of
the three, and had taken orders to pay his
debts by means of the family living, the
revenues of which he had never fully
enjoyed. He had never married, and his
life  though just kept in bounds by the
times in which he lived, so that he did not
get tipsy in the Seyton Arms, nor openly

scandalize a parish with so low a standard
of right as Elderthwaite  was a thoroughly
self-indulgent one. He read the service
once on Sundays, and administered the
Communion three times a year, while the
delay and neglect of funerals, marriages,
and baptisms were the scandal of every
parish round. He rarely visited his flock ;
and yet the vicar was not wholly an unpopular
man. He was good-natured, and
though he drank freely and sometimes
swore loudly, he had a certain amount of
secular intercourse with his parishioners
of a not unneighbourly kind.

The pressure of poverty made Mr.
Seyton a hard landlord, and between
oppression and neglect the inhabitants of
the picturesque tumbledown village were
a bad lot, and neither squire nor parson
did much to make them better. But their
vicar now and then did put before the
worst offenders the consequences of an
evil life in language plain enough to reach
their understanding ; and he had a word
and a laugh for most of them.

Mr. Lester was frequently heard to
inveigle against Parson Seton's shortcomings,
and seriously, as well he might,
regretted the state of Elderthwaite parish ;
but Mr. Seyton doctored all his horses and
dogs when they were ill, and was, " after
all, an old neighbour and a gentleman."
He taught Cherry to catch rats, and took
him out otter-hunting, and there was the
oddest friendship between them, which
Cherry, when a boy, had once exemplified
in the following manner : 

The Bishop had paid an unexpected visit
at Oakby, and Cheriton following in the
wake, while his father and Mr. Ellesmere
were showing off their new schools, heard
him express his intention of going on to
Elderthwaite ; upon which (Cherry ran full
speed across the fields, found Parson Seyton
shooting rabbits, decidedly in shooting
costume, gave him timely warning, and,
with his own hands so tidied, dusted, and
furbished up the wretched old church, that
its vicar, entering into the spirit of the
thing, fell to with a will, astonished the

lazy blind old sexton, and produced such a
result as might pass muster in a necessarily
lenient north country diocese.

Cherry then diffidently produced one of
his father's white ties which he had put in
his pocket, '' thinking you oughtn't have
one clean," and as the old vicar, with a
shout of laughter, arrayed himself in it, he
said, 

"Ay, ay, my lad, between this and the
glass of port I'll give his lordship (he won't
better that in any parish), we'll push
through."

and so they did.

Parson Seyton was a man, if an erring
one ; but the mischief with his young
nephews was that they seemed to have no
force or energy even for being naughty,
and as they grew up their scrapes were all
those of idle self-indulgence, save when the
hereditary pas-sion for gambling broke
out in Dick, the elder of the two, as had
been the case lately, causing his removal
from the tutor with whom he had been
placed. Like their father, they had not

strong health, and the had little taste for
field sports, and none for books ; they lay
in bed half the day, lounged about the
stables, and quarrelled with each other.
But then their father had nothing to do,
read little but the paper, and drank a
great deal more wine than was good for
him.

Their uncle had conferred on them in
his time the inestimable advantage of one
or two good thrashing, and had scant
patience with a kind of evil to which his
burly figure, jolly red face, and hearty
reckless temper had never been inclined.

Virginia had thought a good deal about
her uncle, and was not unprepared to find
him very far removed from the clerical
ideal to which she was accustomed. Perhaps
the notion of bringing a little enlightenment
to so " old-fashioned '* a place
was neither absent nor unwelcome, as she
thought of offering to teach the choir, and
wondered who was feminine head of the
parish.

** I daresay Uncle James has some nice

old housekeeper," lie thought, " who trots
after the poor people, and takes them jelly,
and perhaps teaches the children sewing.
There must be a great many people here
who remember mamma. I hope they will
like me. It will be a much more real
thing trying to be helpful here than at
Littleton, where there were six people for
each bit of work."

Virginia, finding that her brothers did
not appear, began to revive her childish
recollections by going over the house. It
was very large and rambling, with long
unused passages, with all the rooms shut
up. Windows overgrown with interlacing
ivy, panels from which the paint dropped
at a touch, queer little turret chambers,
with rickety staircases leading up to them,
seemed hardly objectionable to Virginia,
who liked the romance of the old forlorn
house, and had not yet tried living in it.
Yet it was not romantic, for Elderthwaite
was not ruinous, only very dirty and out of
repair ; and perhaps the untidy housemaid,
whom Virginia had encountered, was really

more in accordance with its condition than
the white lady or armed spectre that she
gaily thought ought to walk those lonely
passages. Her own young smiling face,
and warm ruby-coloured dress, was in
more startling contrast than either. 80
apparently thought her brother Dick as he
ran up against her on the stairs.

Hallo, Virginia ! " he exclaimed in
astonished accents. "What are you
doing up here P "

Trying to remember my way about.
Don't we keep any ghosts, Dick ? I'm sure
they would find these dark corners exactly
suited to them."

Better ask old Kitty ; she'll tell you all
about them. Good-bye, I'm off," and Dick
clattered downstairs, rather to Virginia's
disappointment, for she had thought the
night before that his delicate, handsome
face was more prepossessing than the
pale stout one of Harry who now joined
her.

*' Where is Dick going ? " she asked.

'' Don't know, I'm sure," said Harry.

*' Do you want to know all the old
stories P "

Yes ! can you tell me ? "

''Do you see that room there?" said
Harry, with eyes that twinkled like his
aunt's; "old grandfather Seyton was an
old rip, you know, if ever there was one,
and he and his friends used to make such a
row you heard them over at Oakby. His
brother was parson then, and bless you !
Uncle Jem's a bishop to him. Well, he'd
got a dozen men dining here, and they all
got as drunk as owls, dead drunk everyone
of them, and the servants put them to
bed up in this gallery. One of them was
in the room next grandfather's, that room
there, and he was found dead the next
morning. Fact, I assure you."

What a horrid story ! " said Virginia,
looking shocked.

"I'll tell you another. Grandfather and
his brother played awfully high, that's how
the avenue was cut down ; and when they
could get no one else they played with each
other, and one night they quarrelled and

seized each other by the throats, and they
both would have been strangled, only grand-mamma
rushed in in her nightgown screaming,
and parted them ; but the parson had
the marks on his throat for ever."

Harry ! you naughty boy ! " exclaimed
Virginia, laughing. " You are inventing
all these frightful stories. I don't believe
them."

They're as true as gospel," said Harry,
looking at her bright, incredulous eyes.
*' There's another about the parson  how
he came through the park at sunrise.
That's not a pretty story to tell you,
though."

I had much rather hear something
about the parson, as you call him, nowadays.
Come downstairs, it's so cold here,
and answer all my questions."

Oh, the parson's a jolly old card," said
Harry, following her. " He's just mad
with Dick because he won't hunt. He's
been in at the death at every meet round,
and don't he swear when any one rides
over the dogs, that's all ! "

Virginia began to think Elderthwaite
must be very old-fashioned indeed.

Doesn't Dick like hunting ? " she said.

No, Dick takes after the governor.
It's cards that'll send him to the devil, and
the first Seyton he'll be that's not worth
having, says Uncle James."

Harry talked in a low, solemn voice, with
the same odd twinkle in his eyes, and it
was very difficult to say whether it was
wicked mischief, or a sort of shameless
naivete, that made him so communicative.

Virginia still strongly suspected him of
a desire to astonish her ; but his last speech
gave her a strange new pang, and she
turned away to safer subjects.

1 suppose the Lester boys are friends
of yours ? "

Well, that's as may be. We're such a
bad lot, you see, that Bob's never allowed
to come here. There was a row once, and
old Lester, a humbugging chap, just
interfered. Jack's such a confounded prig
he wouldn't touch us with a pair of
tongs."

And Cberiton, of course, is too old for

yon."

Clierry ! oli, he isn't a bad fellow. I
go over to Oakby sometimes when he's
there. But it's a slow place, and old
Lester keeps them very tight. And then
he's always humbugging after his schools
and things. Writing to my father about
the state of the village. As if it was his
affair ! " said Harry, in a tone of virtuous
indignation.

Doesn't papa approve of education ? "
said Virginia.

"Bless you, he don't trouble his head
about it. Why should he ? Teach a lot
of poaching vagabonds to read and
write!"

But Uncle James"

Oh, Uncle James," said Harry, with a
spice of mimicry, " he likes his glass of
grog and his ferrets too well to put himself
out of the way. By Jove, here's Aunt
Julia ! I shall be off before I'm asked what
has become of Dick."

Virginia sat still where he had left her.

She oiil} half believed him, and strange to
say there was something so comical in his
manner that she was rather attracted by
its cool sauciness. But she was frightened
and perplexed. What sort of a world was
this into which she had come ? Those
stories, even if true, happened a longtime
ago ; Harry must be in joke about
Dick, and everything was different nowadays.


It was true. The golden age, if such
an expression can be permitted, of Seyton
wickedness had passed away ; and these
were smaller times, times of neglect, mismanagement,
and low poor living, the
dreary dregs of a cup long since drained.
Nobody could quote Mr. Seyton as a
monster of wickedness, because he dawdled
away his time over his sherry,
and knew no excitement but an occasional
game of cards at not very high stakes.
There was many another youth in Westmoreland
who gambled and played billiards
in low company like Dick, and some ladies
perhaps who found all their excitement in

VOL. I. H

the memory of other times, and troubled
themselves as little over any question of
conscience as Miss Seyton.

But it was not all at once that this absence
of all that makes life worth living
could be apparent, and Virginia found her
first confirmation of Harry's words as she
walked through the village on Christmas
morning, and noted the wild, untidy look
of the people, and the wretched state of
their houses, and observed the sullen look
of their faces as her father passed. Dick
did not appear at all ; Harry audibly
supposed the governor was going to
church because Virginia was there," and
certainly church-going did not appear to
be a fashion of the village.

Neither her childish recollections, nor
Harry's remarks, had prepared her, as they
came into the small, ivy-grown church, for
broken floors, cracked windows, and damp
business ; still less for the very scantiest
of congregations, and a rustling silence
where responses should have been. Her
uncle read the service rapidly, with the

broad northern accent now strange to
Iter ears. The old clerk trotted about
whenever Lis services were not required,
and did a little sweeping. Her uncle
paused as lie began the Litany, and called
to him in a loud and cheerful voice to slit
the door.

Virginia peeped out between the faded
green-baize curtains that, hanging round
the great square pew, represented to her
every Church principle she had been taught
to condemn; and found her view obstructed
by a large cobweb. Harry poked at
the spider, and Virginia recalling her own
attention from her despairing visions of
having no better church than this, perceived
that her father was leaning idly back in
his corner. All her standards of right
and wrong seemed confused and shocked ;
so much so that, at the moment, she
hardly distinguished the pain of finding
herself left alone after the sermon, and
seeing her father turn away, from her
horror at her uncle's dirty surplice, and
the dreary degradation of the whole

place. When the parson came after her
after service, and loudly told lier she was
the prettiest lass he'd seen for long
enough, kissing her under the church
porch, she still felt as if the typical bad
parish priest of her imagination had
come to life, and behold he was her own
uncle !

Since this comprehensible form of evil
was so plain to her eyes, what terrible
secrets might not lurk behind it ! Virginia
felt as if she would never be light-hearted
again.

CHAPTER Iii.

riRE AND SNOW.

A northern Christmas, such as painters love.
* # # *

Red sun, blue sky, white snow, and pealed ice,
Keen ringing air which sets the blood on fire."

Christmas is no doubt, theoretically, the
right season for relations who have been
long parted to meet, and there was an
ideal appropriateness in the long absent
heir appearing at Oakby for the first time
on Christmas Day. But practically it
would have been better for Alvar if he
had come home at any other time of the
year. In the first place the frost continued
with unabated severity, and precluded
every out-door amusement but
skating, in which Alvar of course had no

skill, and wliicli lie did not seem at all
willing to learn. Besides, the season
brought an amount of local and parish
business which Mr. Lester attended to
vigorously in person, but the existence of
which Alvar never seemed to realize. His
grandmother's charities he understood, and
was rather amused at seeing the old
women come to fetch their blankets and
cloaks ; but what could he have to do
with any of these people ?

Tenants' dinners and choir-suppers
might form a good opportunity for introducing
him to his neighbours ; and Cheriton,
who was the life and soul of such
festivities, tried to put him forward ; but
he only made magnificent silent bows, and
comported himself much as his brother
Jack had done, when in an access of gruff
shyness and democratic ardour he had
called the Christmas feasts 'relics of
feudalism," and had shown his advanced
notions of the union of classes by never
speaking a word to any one.

Between the new comer and his father

there was an impassable distance. Alvar
never failed in courtesy ; but Clieriton's
quick eyes soon perceived that he resented
deeply the long neglect ; saw too that the
sight of him was a pain and distress to
his father, sharpened his temper, and produced
constant rubs ; though he was careful
to do everything that the proper introduction
of his son demanded of him. A
grand ball was organized in his honour,
and also a stiff and ponderous dinner-party
at which Alvar was to be introduced
to the county magnates.

Special invitations were also sent to
him by their various neighbours, and he
created quite an excitement in the dull
country neighbourhood. Mr. Lester only
half liked being congratulated on his son's
charming foreign manners ; but still, as a
novelty, Alvar had great attractions, and
in society never seemed shy or at a loss.
Mr. Lester's brother-in-law. Judge Cheriton,
invited the stranger to pay him a
visit when the season had a little advanced,
and to let him see a little London society;

for wliicli attention Mr. Lester, who hated
London, was very grateful, as Alvar's
grandfather had Spanish friends there,
and it would have been too intolerable for
the heir of Oakby to have appeared thereunder
auspices which, however distinguished,
Mr. Lester thought suitable only
to a political refugee or a music master.

He had, when he had ceased to pay for
Alvar's English tutor, made him an allowance
which had been magnificent in Spam,
and greatly added to Alvar's consideration
there, and he now increased this to what
he considered a sufficient sum for his
eldest son's dignity. Li short he did
everything but overcome his personal distaste
to him ; he never willingly spoke to
him, and the very sight of him was an
irritation to him. He got less too than
usual of Cheriton's company ; their walks,
and talks, and consultations were curtailed
by Alvar's requirements. Indeed Cherry
was pulled in many different directions,
and he ended by sacrificing all the reading
that was to have been got through during

the vacation. For the home life was very
difficult, and the more they saw of the
stranger the less they liked him.

He's not of our sort," said Bob, as if
that settled the matter, not perceiving
that his slowness to receive impressions,
and difficulty in accommodating himself to
a new life, might spring as much from his
Lester blood as from his Spanish breeding.

'' He might try and look like an Englishman,"
growled Jack.

When you go to Spain, we shall see
you in a sofnhrero dancing under the
orange-trees to a pair of castanets," retorted
Cheriton. " We should all be so
ready at foreign languages and so accommodating,
shouldn't we ?"

Alvar's individuality was not to be
ignored, though unfortunately it was very
distasteful to his kindred. He was so
dignified, so terribly polite they were half
afraid of him, and as the awe wore off,
they wanted to quarrel with him. He
announced that he loved riding, and
seemed to know something of horses ; he

played billiards much too well to be a
pleasant opponent to this father, he sang
much too quaintly and prettily for his
family to appreciate, and he played the
guitar ! Even Cheriton wished it had
been a fiddle. He hated going to walk,
smoked incessantly, and was indifferent
to every one except Cheriton, to whom he
deferred in everything.

Poor Cheriton ! " Among the blind, the
one-eyed is king," and his sentiments were
amazingly liberal for Oakby ; but he was
very young and deeply attached to his
home and his surroundings, too tenderhearted
not to be touched at Alvar's preference,
imaginative enough to realize his
position, and yet repelled and put out of
countenance by his peculiarities. To be
tenderly addressed as " my brother," '' mi
Caro," ' mi Clierifo?," '' Cherito mio," to
be deferred to on all occasions, and even
told in the hearing of Jack and Bob " that
his eyes wien he laughed were the colour
of the ]mediterranean on a sunny day,"
was, as he said, ''so out-facing, that it

made him feel a perfect fool," especially
when his brothers echoed it at every turn.

Yet he put up with it. It was so hard
on the poor fellow if no one was kind to
him ! So hard, he added to himself, to bean
unloved and unloving son.

Perhaps, after all, Alvar's essential
strangeness prevented Cheriton from feeling
himself put aside.

Cheriton was very popular at school and
at college. He had strong intellectual
ambitions, and though of less powerful
mind than Jack, had attained to much
graceful scholarship and possessed much
command of language. He hoped to take
honours, to go to the bar, and distinguish
himself there under his uncle. Judge
Cheriton's, auspices. He had too a further
and a sweeter hope, hitherto confided to
no one.

But it was a certain "genius for loving"
that really distinguished him from his
fellows  really made him every one's
friend. He did not seek out his poorer
neighbours so much from a sense of duty,

as because this heart went out to every one
belonging to Oakby, nay, every animal,
every bit of ground  nothing was a trouble
that conduced to the welfare of the place.
This loving-kindness was a natural gift;
but Cheriton made good use of it. He
had high principles, and deep within his
soul, struggling with the temptations of
this ardent nature, were the pure aspirations
and the capability of fervent piety
which have made saints  responsibilities
with which he was born.

But all this fire and force did not make
tolerance easy ; he was full of instinctive
prejudices, and perhaps his greatest aids
in his dealings with his new brother were
his joyous unchecked spirits and the keen
sense of the ludicrous that enabled him to
laugh at himself as well as at other people.

Some little time after Alvar's arrival
there was a deep fall of snow, and while
the pond was being swept for skating, the
yoimg Lesters, with Harry Seyton and the
children from the rectory, who had come
up for the purpose, proceeded to erect a

snow man of gigantic proportions in front
of the house.

What a fright you have made of him ! "
said Cheriton, coming up with Alvar as
they finished; ''he has no nose and no
expression."

Well, come and do his nose, then ;
it keeps on coming off," said Nettie, who
was standing on a bench to put the finishing
touches.

Cherry was nothing loath, and was soon
engaged in moulding the snowy countenance
with the skill of long practice, while
Alvar, with his great crimson-lined cloak
wrapped about him, stood looking on.

Give him a good ktmjpy nose, that
won't melt," said Cherry. " There, he's
lovely ! got an old pipe for him ? "

As he spoke a great snow-ball came
stinging against his face, and in a moment,
to the astonishment of Alvar, the whole
party set on Cherry, and a wild bout of
snow-balling ensued.

"No, no, that's not fair ! I can't fight
you all," shouted Cherry ; " and you've

got all your snow-balls ready made. Give
me the girls, and then  Come on."

'' Oil, yes, yes ; we'll be on Cherry's
side," cried Nettie.

It was a picturesque scene enough  the
pale blue sky overhead, the dazzling snow
under foot, the little girls in their scarlet
cloaks or petticoats, their long hair flying
as they darted in and out, the great boys
struggling, wrestling, knocking each
other about with small mercy No one
threw a snowball at Alvar ; perhaps they
had forgotten him, as he stood silently
watching them as if they were a troop of
Deserters, till the contest terminated in a
tremendous struggle between Cheriton and
Jack, who were, of course, much the
biggest of the party. Cherry was getting
decidedly the worst of it, and either
tripped in the rough snow or was thrown
down into it by Jack, when suddenly
Alvar threw off his cloak, stepped forward,
and seizing Jack by the shoulders, pulled
him back with sudden irresistible force.

"By Jove ! " was all that Jack could utter.

'* What on earth did you do that for ? "
ejaculated Cherry as soon as he gained his
breath and his feet.

He might have hurt you, my brother,"
said Alvar, who looked flushed, and for
once excited. " And besides, I am stronger
than either of you. I could struggle with
you both."

'' Hurt me ? Suppose he had ? " said
Cherry disdainfully. " But, Jack  Jack,
I do believe you're getting too many forme
at last."

'' That is what you call athletics," said
Alvar, who looked unusually bright.

Yes ; wrestling is a regular north
country game, and the fellows about here
have taught us all the tricks of it. Come,
Jack, let us show him a bout"'

The two brothers pulled ofl" their coats,
and set to with a will; and after a long
struggle, and with considerable difficulty,
Cheriton succeeded in throwing Jack.

*' There, I've done it once more ! " he
said breathlessly, "and I don't suppose I
shall ever do it again. You're getting

much stronger than I am, and of course
you're heavier."

'' Let me try to throw you clown," said
Alvar eagerly.

Nay, Jack may have first turn ; but
it's fair to tell you there's a great deal of
knack in it."

Alvar, however, was man instead of boy;
he was quite as tall as Jack, and however
he might have learnt to exercise his
muscles, his grasp was like steel ; and
though Jack's superior skill triumphed in
the end, Alvar rose up cool and smiling,
and Jack panted out, in half-unwilling
admiration, 

You'd beat us all with a little
training."

Ah yes ; that is because I am an
Englishman," said Alvar complacently.
But I bear no malice, Jack. It is in
sport."

*' Of course," said Jack. "Now, Cherry,
you try."

*' It's hardly fair in a biting frost," said
Cherry ; " nobody can have any wind.

However, here's for the honour of Westmoreland."


The younger ones gathered round in an
admunng circle, and Cheriton, who did not
like to be beaten, put forth all the strength
and skill of which he was master. But he
was the more slightly made, and had met
his match, and to the extreme chagrin of
his brothers and Nettie, sustained an entire
defeat.

Well, I never thought you would throw
him'' said Jack, in a tone of deep disappointment.


Ah," said Alvar, " they always called
me the strong Englishman."

'' Papa was the strongest man in Westmoreland,"
said Nettie.

Then," said Alvar, '' so far I have
proved myself his son, and your brother.
I would not skate with you, for I should
look like a fool ; but I knew you could not
easily throw me down, since that is your
sport. But, my brother, I have hurt
you."

No," said Cheriton getting up, " only

VOL. I. I

knocked all the wind out of me, and made
me look like a fool ! Never mind, we shall
understand each other all the better.
Come upstairs, and we will show you some
of the cups and things we have won in
boat-races and athletics."

This was a clever stroke of Cheriton's ;
he wanted to make Alvar free of the premises,
and had not yet found a good
excuse. So, leaving the younger one s
to finish their snow-balling, he and Jack
conducted Alvar up to the top of the
house, where, at the end of the passage
where they slept, was a curious low room,
with a long, low Window, looking west,
above the west window of the drawing-room,
and occupying nearly one side of
the room, almost like the windows of the
hand-loom weavers in the West Riding.

There was a low seat underneath, broad
enough to lie on, but furnished with very
dilapidated cushions. There was a 
in the room, and a cupboard for
guns, and sundry cases of stuffed birds,
one table covered with tools, glue-pots,

and messes of all descriptions ; and
another, it is but justice to add, supplied
with ink, pens, and paper, and various
formidable-looking books, for here the boys
did their reading. There was a great, old-fashioned
grate with a blazing fire in it,
and very incongruous ornaments above ita
stuffed dormouse, ISTettie's property 
she maintained a footing in the room by
favour  various pipes, two china dogs,
white, with brown spots on them, presented
to Cherry in infancy by his nurse,
and a wooden owl carved by their cousin
Eupert  a cousin in the second degree,
who had been much with them owing
to his father's early death. On one
side of the room were arranged on a
sort of sideboard the cups and tankards
which were the trophies of the brothers'
prowess, and these were now each
pointed out to Alvar, and the circumstances
of their acquisition described.
Cheriton's were fewer in proportion, and
chiefly for leaping and hurdle-racing; and
Jack explained that Cherry's forte was
I 2

cricket, and that, since he lead once
knocked himself up at school by a tremendous
flat-race, their father had greatly
objected to his going into training.

*'0h, it's not that," said Cherry; ''he
would not care now ; but I really haven't
time. I must grind pretty hard from now
to midsummer."

'' There is one thing I have read of,"
said Alvar, 'ein English newspapers. It
is a race of boats on the Thames between
Oxford and Cambridge."

Oh, yes, you must go and see it.
That's Jack's ambition  to be one of the
crew."

"Ah, but you see there's no river at

E. , and that's so unlucky," said Jack

seriously.

And so what with explanations and
questions the ice melted a little. Alvar
looked smiling and beneficent ; he did not
seem at all ashamed of his own ignorance ;
and Jack evidently regarded him with a
new respect.

Cheriton also contrived that the Seytons,

with the vicar of Oakby, Mr. Ellesmere and
his wife, should be asked to dinner ; and
as the vicar had some general conversation,
some information about Spain was elicited
from Alvar, who, moreover, was pleased
to find himself in ladies' society, and was
evidently at ease in it ; while Virginia, in
exchange for the pleasant talk that seemed
to come out of her old life, could tell
Cheriton that her cousin Ruth was coming
to stay with her, and could confide in him
that home was still a little strange.

'' Well, strangers are strange," said
Cherry. '* We are shaking down, but the
number of tempers lost in the process
might be advertised for * as of no value
except to the owners,' if to them. Only
the home-made article, you understand  "

'' Dear me," said Virginia, '' I should as
soon think of losing my temper with the
Cid. Aren't you afraid of him ? "

Cheriton made an irresistibly ludicrous
face.

"Don't tell," he said, 'but I think weare
; and yet, you know, we think ' yon

southern chap,' as old Bates called him,
must be ' a bit of a softy ' after all."

Oil, Cherry, that is how you talked
yourself when we were children," exclaimed
Yirginia impulsively. " Do you
know I feel I was born here, when I
hear the broad Westmoreland. I never
forgot it."

Nay, I'm glad you don't say I talk so
now," said Cherry. '' They tell me at Oxford
that my tongue always betrays me
when I am excited. But here comes
Alvar ; now make him fall in love with
Westmoreland. Alvar, Miss Seyton has
been abroad, so67/eis not quite a benighted
savage."

My brother Cheriton is not a savage,"
said Alvar, smiling, as Cherry moved
away. " He is the kindest and most beautiful
person I have ever seen."

*' Yes, he is very kind. But I hope, Mr.
Lester, that you do not think us all
savages, with that one exception."

'' In future I can never think so," said
Alvar, with a bow. " These boys are

savage certainly  very savage, but I do
not care."

'' It is strange, is it not," said Virginia,
rather timidly, " to have to make acquaintance
with one's own* father?"

Of my father I say nothing," said
Alvar, with a sudden air of hauteur, that
made the impulsive Virginia blush, and
feel as if she had taken a liberty with him,
till he added, with a smile, " Miss Seyton,
too, I hear, is a stranger."

Yes, I have been away ever since I
was a little girl, and  and I had forgotten
my relations."

'' I have not known mine," said Alvar ;
Cheriton wrote to me once a little letter.
I have it now, and since then I have loved
him. I do not know the rest, and they
wish I was not here."

'' But don't you think," said Virginia
earnestly, " that we  that you wall soon
feel more at home with them ?"

Oh, I do not know," said Alvar, with
a shrug. " It is cold, and I am so dull
that I could die. They understand noticing.

And in Spain I was the chief ; I
could do what I wished. Here I must
follow and obey. My name even is different.
1 do not know '' Mr. Lester." I am
'* Don Alvar." Will you not call me so ?"

But that would be so very strange tome,"
said Virginia, parrying this request.
Every one will call you Mr. Lester. How
tall Nettie is grown. Do you not think
her very pretty ? "

'' Oh, she is pink, and white, and blue,
and yellow ; but she is like a little boy.
There is not in her eyes the attraction,
the coquetry, which I admire," said Alvar,
pointing his remark with a glance at his
companion's lucid, beaming, interested
eyes, in which however there was little
conscious coquetry.

I am sorry to hear you admire coquettes,"
was too obvious an answer to be
resisted.

Nay, it is the privilege of beauty,"
said Alvar.

Virginia, like many impulsive people,
was apt to recollect with a cold chill conversations

by wMcli at the time she had
been entirely carried away. But on looking
back at this one she liked it. Alvar's
dignity and grace of manner made his
trifling compliments both flattering and
respectful. His feelings, too, she thought,
were evidently deep and tender ; and how
she pitied him for his solitary condition
!

CHAPTER VIII.

A DAT OF Best.

"Gaily the troubadour touched his guitar."

On the third Sunday morning after Alvar's
arrival, Mr. Lester came down as usual at
the sound of the gong, and as he glanced
round the dining-room missed his two
elder sons.

Prayers were over and breakfast had
begun before Alvar entered.

Ah pardon," he said, bowing to his
grandmother; " I did not know it was late'*

I make a point of being punctual on
Sunday," said Mr. Lester, in a tone of
incipient displeasure.

*' Cheriton is late too," said Alvar.

No," said Jack, '' he's gone to
Church."

'' Ah, then lue clo not go to-day," said
Alvar, with an air of relief so comical
that even the solemn Jack could hardly
stand it.

'' Oh, yes, we do," he said, 'this is
extra."

Cheriton," said Mr. Lester, " is very
attentive to his religious duties."

"I suppose he'll have breakfast at the
Vicarage," said Nettie, as Alvar raised his
eyebrows and gave a little shrug.

It was a gesture habitual to him, and
was not intended to express contempt
either for religion or for Cheriton,' but
only a want of comprehension of the affair ;
but it annoyed Mr. Lester and called his
attention to the fact that Alvar had
appeared in a black velvet coat of a peculiar
foreign cut, the sight of which he
disliked on a week-day, and considered intolerable
when it was contrasted with the
spruce neatness of the rest of the party.
He could not very well attack Alvar on
the subject, but he sharply reproved Bob
for cutting hunches of bread when no one

wanted them, and found fault with the
coffee. And then, apparently a ijrojjos of
nothing, he began to make a little speech
about the importance of example in a
country place, and the influence of trifles.

And I can assure every one present,"
he concluded emphatically, " that there is
no need to look far for an example of the
evil effects of neglect in these particulars."

"Elderthwaite ?" whispered Nettie to
Jack.

*' Ay," said Mrs. Lester, '' young people
should show respect to Sunday morning.
It is what in my father's house was always
insisted on. Your grandfather, too, used
to say that he liked his dogs even to know
Sunday."

It is strange to me," said Alvar coolly.

It will be well that you should give
yourself the pains to become accustomed
to it," said his father curtly.

It was the first time that the stately
stranger had been addressed in such a
tone, and he looked up with a flash of the
eye that startled the younger ones.

Sir, it is by your will I am a stranger
here," he said, with evident displeasure.

Stranger or no, my regulations must
be respected," said Mr. Lester, his colour
rising.

Alvar rose from his seat and proved his
claim at any rate to the family temper by
bowing to his grandmother and marching
out of the room.

'eighty mighty ! " said the grandmother.
' Here's a spirt of temper for you ! "

'' Intolerable insolence ! " exclaimed Mr.
Lester. " Under my roof he must submit
to what I please to say to him."

"It's just what I told ye, Gerald; a
foreigner's ways are what we cannot do
with," said Mrs. Lester.

Of course," blurted out Jack, with the
laudable desire of mending matters ; '' of
course he is a foreigner. How can you
expect him to be anything else ? And
father never said it was his coat."

'' His coat?" said Mr. Lester. " It is
his temper to which I object. When
he came I told him that I expected

Sunday to be observed in mj house, and
lie agreed."

But lie did not understand that you
thought that coat improper on Sunday,"
said Jack with persevering justice.

I am not in the habit of being obscure,"
said Mr. Lester, as he rose from
the table, while Jack thought he would
give Alvar a little good advice.

Clierry was too soft ; he was equally
impartial, and would be more plain
spoken. But as he approached the library
he heard an ominous tinkling, and entering,
beheld Alvar, still in the objectionable
coat, beginning to play on the still
more objectionable guitar, an air which
Jack did not think sounded like a hymn
tune.

Jack really intended to mend matters,
but his manner was unfortunate, and in
the tone he would have used to a disobedient
fag he remarked, as he stood bolt
upright beside his brother, 

'' I say, Alvar, 1 think you'd better not
play on that thing this morning."

There is no reason for you to tell me
what to do," said Alvar quietly.

It's not, you know," said Jack, " that
I think there's any harm in it. My views
are very liberal. I only think it's a frivolous
and unmanly sort of instrument ; but
the governor won't like it, and there'll be
no end of a row."

"You have not a musical soul," said
Alvar loftily, for he had had time to cool
down somewhat.

Certainly not," said the liberal Jack,
with unnecessary energy and a tone of
disgust; "but that's not the question.
It's not the custom here to play that sort of
thing on a thing like that on a Sunday
morning. Ask Cherry."

"Would it vex my brother?" asked
Alvar.

If you mean Cheriton, it certainly
would. He hates a row."

A row ? " said the puzzled Alvar, " that
is a noise  my guitar ? "

Oh, hang it ! no, a quarrel," began
Jack, when suddenly 

'' Sir, I consider this an act of defiance;
1 beg I may see that instrument put away
at once," and Mr. Lester's voice took the
threatening sound that made his anger
always appear so much worse than it really
was. '' I will have the proprieties of my
house observed, and no example of this
kind set to your younger brothers."

Alvar had taken Jack's interference with
cool contempt, but now he started up with
a look of such passion as fairly subdued
Jack into a hasty 

Oh come, come, I say, now  don't ! "

Alvar controlled himself suddenly and
entirely.

Sir, I obey my father's commands. I
will say good morning," and taking up his
guitar went up to his own room, from
which he did not emerge at church time,
and as no one ventured to call him they set
off without him. Among themselves they
might quarrel and make it up again many
times a day, but Alvar' s feelings were
evidently more serious.

It was occasionally Cheriton's practice

to sing in the choir, more for the popularity
of his example than for his voice, which
was indifferent. Alvar had been greatly
puzzled at his doing so, and had then told
him that "in that white robe he looked like
the picture of an angel," a remark which
so discomfited Cherry that he had further
perplexed his unlucky brother by saying, 

Fray don't say such a thing to the
others, I should never hear the last of it.
You'd better say I look like an ass at
once."

He did not therefore see anything of his
family till he met them after the service,
when Jack attacked him.

What induced you to go out this morning?
Everything has gone utterly wrong,
and I shouldn't wonder if we should find
Alvar gone back to Spain."

Why, what's the matter ? "

Alvar came down late in that ridiculous
coat and then played the guitar. And if
ever you saw a fellow in a passion ! He
likes his own way."

Was father angry ? "

VOL. I. K

I should just think so, I don't expect
they'll speak."

This was a pleasant prospect. Cheriton
saw that his father's brow was cloudy, and
as he went upstairs his grandmother called
him into her room.

Cheriton," she said mysteriously, as
she sat down and untied her bonnet, " Jack
has told you of your brother's behaviour,
and it's my belief there's a clue to it, and I
hope you'll take warning, for I sometimes
think ye're a hankering after that way
yourself."

What way, grand mamma ? I never
play the guitar on a Sunday morning."

'' Nay, but there's more behind. It's
well known how Sunday is profaned in
Popish countries. I've heard they keep
the shops open in France. Your brother
has been brought up among Papists, and
it would be a sad thing for your father's
son to give all this property into the hands
of the priests."

Dear me, granny, what a frightful
suggestion. But I'm sure Alvar has no

Romish sympathies. He has no turn for
anything of the kind, and I should think
the Roman Church was very unattractive
in Spain."

"Ay, but they're very deep."

"Well," said Cherry, "if Alvar is a
Jesuit in disguise, as you say, and rather
a dissipated person, as my father seems to
think, and has such an appalling temper
as Jack describes, we're in a bad way. I
think I'll go and see for myself."

When Cherry entered Alvar' s room he
found this alarming compound of qualities
sitting by the fire looking forlorn and lonely.

Why, Alvar, what's all this about ? "

Ah, my brother," said Alvar, " you
were absent and all has been wrong. My
father is offended with me. I know not
why. He insulted me."

Oh, nonsense ! we never talk about
being insulted. My father's a little hasty,
but he means nothing by it. What did
you do that annoyed him ? "

"I played my guitar and Jack scolded
me. No one shall do so but you."
K 2

I daresay Jack made an ass of himself
lie often does ; but lie is a thorough
good fellow at bottom. You know we do
get up in our best clothes on Sunday."

'' I can do that," said Alvar, " but your
Sunday I do not understand. You tell
me I may not play at cards or at billiards ;
you do not dance nor go to the theatre.
What good does it do ? T would go to
church, though it is tiresome, and I
shudder at the singing. It is a mark,
doubtless, of my father's politics; but at
home  well, I can smoke, if that is
better ? "

Driven back to first principles, Cheriton
hardly knew what to say. '' Of course,"
he answered. " I have often heard the
matter discussed, and I don't pretend to
say that at Oxford the best of us are as
particular as we might be. But in a
country place like this, carelessness would
do infinite harm. And, on the whole, I
shouldn't like the rule to be otherwise."

Alvar sighed, and made no answer.
*' But," continued Cherry, ** I think no

one has a right to impose rules on you. I
wouldn't bring out the guitar in the morning
 it looks rather odd, you know  nor
wear that coat. But we're not so very
strict; there are always newspapers about,
and novels, and, as you say, you can smoke
or talk, or play the piano I'm sure no
one would know what the tune was  or
write letters. Really, it might be worse,
you know."

Perhaps Cherry's coaxing voice and eyes
were more effectual than his arguments ;
any way, Alvar said, '' Well, I will offer
my hand to my father, if he will take
it."

Oh, no ; pray don't make a scene
about it. There's the gong. Put on your
other coat, and come down. We do eat
our dinner on Sunday, and I'm awfully
hungry."

Whether Mr. Lester accepted the coat
as a flag of truce, or whether he did not
wish to provoke a contest with an unknown
adversary, nothing more was said ; but
Alvar' s evil star was in the ascendant, and

he was destined to run counter to his
family in a more unpardonable way.

He had no sympathy whatever with the
love for animals, which was perhaps the
softest side of his rough kindred. All the
English Lesters were imbued with that
devotion to live creatures which is ingrain
with some natures. No trouble was too
great to take for them. Bob and Nettie
got up in the morning and went out in all
weathers to feed their ferrets, or their
jackdaws, or whatever pet was' young, sick,
or troublesome. Heritor's great St.
Bernard, Rolla, ranked somewhere very
near Jack in his affections, and had been
taught, trained, beaten, and petted, till he
loved his master with untiring devotion.
Mrs. Lester had her chickens and turkeys,
Mr. Lester his prize cattle and his horses,
some of the latter old and well-tried
friends.

It must be admitted that Oakby was a
trying place for people devoid of this sentiment.
Every one had a dog, more or less
valuable, and jackdaws and magpies have

their drawbacks as members of a family.
Alvar openly said that he had never seen
anybody make pets of dumb animals, and
that he could not understand doing so;
and though he took no notice of them,
Rolla and an old pointer of Mr. Lester's,
called Rose, had already been thrashed for
growling at him.

On this particular Sunday afternoon,
the bright cold weather clouded over and
promised a thaw. Alvar preferred dulness
to the weather out-of-doors, and Cheriton
accompanied his father on the Sunday
stroll, which included all the beasts on
the premises, and generally ended in visits
to the old keeper and coachman, who
thought it the height of religious advantage
to hear the squire read a chapter.

Mr. Lester was aware that he had been
impatient with his son, and that Alvar
could not be expected to be imbued with
an instinctive knowledge of those forms of
religion with which his father had been
inspired by his young brilliant wife, when
Fanny " had taught him to restore his

church and build his schools in a fuller
fashion than had satisfied his father, and
made him believe that his position demanded
of himself and his family a
personal participation in all good works
some control of them he naturally
desired.

He was, as Mr. Ellesmere said, with a
little shrug, when forced to yield a point,
a model squire," conscientious and openhanded,
but unpersuadable. Perhaps the
clear-eyed, wide-souled Fanny might have
allowed more readily for the necessary
changes of twenty years. Certainly she
would better have appreciated a newcomer's
difficulties ; while poor Mr. Lester
felt that Fanny's ideal was invaded, and
not by Fanny's son. It spoilt his walk with
Cheriton, and made him reply sharply to
the latter's attempts at agreeable conversation.
Cheriton at length left him at the
old gamekeeper's ; and while Mr. Lester's
irritable accents were softened into kindly
inquiries for the old father, now pensioned
off, he chatted to the son, at present in

command, who had been taking care of a
terrier puppy for him.

Finding that Buffer, so called from his
prevailing colour, was looking strong and
lively, Cheriton thought it would be as
well to accustom him to society, and took
him back to the house. He could not help
wondering what would become of Alvar
when he was left alone at Oakby. Another
fortnight would hardly be sufficient to give
him any comfortable, independent habits ;
how could he endure such deadly dulness
as the life there would bring him ? That
fortnight would be lively enough, and there
would be his cousin, Rupert Lester, for an
additional companion, and another Miss
Seyton, more attractive than Virginia, for
an occasional excitement. If Alvar was
so fascinating a person to young ladies,
would he  would she  ? An indefinite
haze of questions pervaded Cheriton' s mind,
and as he reckoned over the county beauties
whom he could introduce to Alvar,
and whom he would surely admire more
than just the one particular beauty who

had first occurred to his thoughts, he
reached the house. He found his brothers
and Nettie alone in the library, Alvar sitting
apart in the window, and looking out
at the stormy sky.

Hallo ! " said Jack, " so you have
brought Buffer up. Well, he has grown
a nice little chap."

'' Yes, I thought it was time he should
begin his education. Nice head, hasn't he ?
He is just like old Peggy."

Yes, he'll be a very good dog some
day."

'' Set him down," said Bob ; " let's have
a look at him."

"Little darling!" said Nettie, enthusiastically.


Buffer was duly examined, and then, as
Cherry turned to the fire to warm himself,
observing that it was colder than ever,
began to play about the room, while they
entered on a discussion of the merits of
all his relations up to their dim recollection
of his great-grandmother.

Buffer made himself much at home,

poked about the room, and at last crossed
over to Alvar, who had sat on, unheeding
his entrance. Buffer gave his trousers a
gentle pull. Alvar shook him off. Here
was another tiresome little beast ; then,
just as Cherry crossed over to the window
in search of him, he made a dart at Alvar's
foot and bit it sharply. Alvar sprang up
with a few vehement Spanish words, gave
the little dog a rough kick, and then dashed
it away from him with a gesture of fierce
annoyance. Buffer uttered a howl of
pain.

I say, that's too rough," exclaimed
Cherry, snatching up the puppy, which
cried and moaned.

'' But it bit me ! " said Alvar, angrily.

I believe you have killed him," said
Cheriton.

You cruel coward," cried Nettie, bursting
into a storm of tears.

Alvar stood facing all the four, their
blue eyes flashing scorn and indignation ;
but, angry as they were, they were too
practical to waste time in reproaches.

Jack brought a light, and Bob, whose skill
in such matters equalled his literary incapacity,
felt Buffer's limbs scientifically.

No ribs broken," he said ; " he's
bruised, though, poor little beggar ! Ah !
he has put his shoulder out. Now, Cherry,
if your hand's going to shake, give him to
Jack. I'll pull it in again."

I can hold him steady," said Alvar, ina
low voice.

No, thank you," said Cherry, curtly,
as Jack put a hand to steady his hold, and
the operation was performed amid piteous
shrieks from Buffer. Alvar had the sense
to watch them in silence. What had he
done ? A kick and a blow to any domestic
animal was common enough in Spain.
And now he had roused all this righteous
indignation, and, far worse, offended
Cherry, and seen his distress at the little
animal's suffering, and at its cause. Buffer
was no sooner laid in Nettie's arms to be
consented and comforted, than he seized
Cherry's hand.

Ah, my brother ! I did not know the

little clog was yours. I would not touch
him"

"What difference does that make?" said
Cherry, shaking him off and walking away

I shall keep my dog out of his way,'
said Bob, contemptuously.

I suppose Spaniards are savages,'
said Jack, in a tone of deadly indignation

He'd better play a thousand guitars
than hurt a poor little innocent puppy ! "
said Nettie, half sobbing.

Alvar stood looking mournfully before
him ; his anger had died out ; he looked
almost ready to cry with perplexity.

Cheriton turned round. " I won't have
a fuss made," he said. ' Take Buffer upstairs
to my room, and don't say a word to
any one. It can't be helped."

I know ivho I shall never say a word
to," said Nettie ; but she obeyed, followed
by Jack and Bob. Alvar detained Cheriton.


Oh, my brother, forgive me. I would
have broken my own arm sooner than see
your eyes look at me thus. It is with usa

word and a blow. I will never strike
any little beast again  never."

He looked so wretched that Cheriton
answered reluctantly, " I don't mean to say
any more about it."

But you are angry still ? "

No, I'm not angry. I suppose you feel
differently. I hate to see anything suffer."

"And I to see you suffer, my brother."

I ? nonsense ! I tell you that's nothing
to do with it. There, let it drop. I shall
say no more."

He escaped, unable further to satisfy his
brother, and went upstairs, where Buffer
had been put to bed comfortably.

Did you ever know such a nasty trick
in your life ? " said Jack, as they left the
twins to watch the invalid's slumbers.

"Oh!" said Ch-merry, turning into his
room, " it's all hopeless and miserable.
We shall never come to any good  never ! "

*' Oh, come, come now. Cherry," said
Jack, for once assuming the office of consoler.
" Buffer '11 do well enough; don't
be so despairing."

Cheriton lead much the brighter and
serene nature of the two ; but he was subject
to fits of reaction, when Jack's cooler
temperament held its own.

'at's not Buffer," he said, "it's Alvar !
How can one ever have any brotherly
feeling for a fellow like that ? He's as
different as a Red Indian ! "

'* It vvould be very odd and unnatural if
you had much brotherly feeling for him,"
said Jack. " Why do you trouble yourself
about him ? "

But he does seem to have taken a sort
of fancy to me, and the poor fellow's a
stranger ! "

"You're a great deal too soft about
him. Of course he likes you, when
you're always looking him up. Don't be
superstitious about it  he's only our
half-brother ; and don't go down to tea
looking like that, or you'll have the
governor asking what's the matter with
you."

Remember, I'll not have a word said
about it," said Cheriton emphatically.

Nothing was said publicly about it, but
Alvar was made to feel himself in disgrace,
and endeavoured to re-ingratiate himself
with Cherry with a simplicity that was
irresistible. He asked humbly after Buffer's
health, and finally presented him with
a silver chain for a collar.

When Buffer began to limp about on
three legs, his tawny countenance looking
out above the silver engraved heart that
clasped the collar with the sentimental leer
peculiar to puppyhood, the effect was sufficiently
ludicrous ; but he forgave Alvar
sooner than his brothers did, and perhaps
grateful for his finery, became rather fond
of him.

CHAPTER IX.

RUTH.
'' She has two eyes so soft and brown."

There was a little oak-panelled bedroom
at Elderthwaite, which had been called
Ruth's ever since, as a curly-haired, brown-skinned
child, the little orphan cousin had
come from her grandmother's in London
and paid a long visit in the North some
five or six years before the winter's day on
which she now occupied it, when she came
to be present at the Lesters' ball. She
was a nut-brown maid still, with rough,
curly hair and great dark eyes, with curly,
upturned lashes  eyes that were like Virginia's
in shape, colour, and fervour, but
which glanced and gleamed and melted

VOL. I. L

after a fashion wholly their own. She was
slender and small, and though with no
wonderful beauty of feature or perfection
of form, whether she sat or stood she made
a picture ; all colours that she wore became
her, all scenes set off her peculiar grace.
"Now, her brown velvet dress, her rusty
hair against the dark oak shutter, as she
sat crouched up in the window-seat, were
a perfect '' symphony in brown."

Ruth Seyton was an orphan, and lived
with her grandmother, Lady Charlton, a
gentle, worldly old lady, whose great object
was to see her well married, and to steer
her course safely through all the dangers
that might affect the course of a well-endowed
and very attractive girl. The
scorn which Ruth felt for the shallow
feelings and worldly notions with which
she was expected to enter on the question
of her own future was justifiable enough,
and led to a violent reaction and to a fervour
of false romance. Ruth had found
her hero and formulated her view of life,
and the hero was Rupert Lester, whom she

was about to meet at the ball given in
Alvar's honour, and between whom and
herself lay the memory of something more
than a flirtation.

The theory was, that the hero once found,
the grand passion once experienced, was
its own justification, itself the proof of
depth of character and worth of heart. A
girl who paused to consider her lover's
character or her friends' disapproval, when
she had once given her heart away, was a
weak and cold-natured creature in her
opinion. She knew that many difficulties
lay between her and Rupert Lester, and
she gloried in the thought of how they
should be overcome, rejoiced in her own
discrimination, which could see the difference
between this real passion and the
worldly motives of some of her other admirers,
or the boyish fancy of Cheriton
Lester, who talked to her about his brothers
and his occupations, and had room in his
heart, so it seemed to her, for a thousand
lesser loves. Ruth believed that she despised
flirtation; but there could be no

harm in being pleasant to a boy sbe bad
known all ber life and whose attentions just
now were so convenient. Besides, Cberiton
was really very like bis cousin Rupert,
very like the photograph wbicb sbe
now bid away as Virginia came in search
of ber.

Tbe two cousins bad been a great deal
together at intervals and were fond of each
other, and Virginia knew something about
Rupert ; but Ruth knew better than to
give ber full confidence on the subject.

Well," sbe said, as her cousin entered,
and how does the world go with you ?
Do you see much of the Lester s ? "

Yes ; while the frost lasted I used to
go down to the ice with the boys, and we
met there. Cberiton comes over here
sometimes, and once he brought his
brother."

'* What, the Spaniard ? How do they
manage ? Is he very queer ? "

'* Ob, no ! Of course he is very unlike
the others. Cherry gets on very well with
him. I bebeve Mr. Lester does not wish

the boys to come here much," added Virginia,
abruptly.

Well, it wasn't approved of in Roland's
time," said Ruth.

"Were we always bad company?" said
Virginia. " I have had a great deal to
learn. Why did you never make me understand
better what Elderthwaite was like ?"

But, Queenie," said Ruth cautiously,
using a pet name of Virginia's girlhood,
*' surely you iveie told how tumbledown
the place was, and how stupid and behindhand
everything would be. Poor dear
uncle James ought to have lived fifty years
since*'

I don't believe that parish priests
taught their people nothing but to catch
rats fifty years since," said Virginia, with
a touch of the family bitterness in her
voice. "Is it because papa is poor that
the men-servants get tipsy, and Dick and
Harry are always after them? Oh, Ruth'*
suddenly softening, '' I ought not to have
said it, but the boys aren't brought upwell
; and if you said how wretched the

people in the village are  and they look so
wicked."

'eyes," said Ruth, as Virginia's tears
silenced her, 'but you know we Seton
are a bad lot. We're born, they say,
with a drop of bad blood in us. Look at
Aunt Julia, she was driven desperate and
ran away  small blame to her  when her
lover's father forbade the match; but they
caught and stopped her. After that she
never cared what she did, and just lived
bj making fun of things."

Virginia shuddered. Could her lazy,
sarcastic aunt have ever known the thrilling
and yearnings which were beating in
her own heart now ?

There is not much fun in it," she said.

"No. As for Dick, I don't think much
of 1dm. Poor old Roland was worth a
dozen of him. I don't care what people
do as long as they are something. But
Dick has no fine feelings."

Ruth," said Virginia, " I think I was
not taught better for nothing. I am sure
papa is very unhappy; he thinks how

wrong every tiling is. Poor papa ! Grand-papa
was such a bad father for him. I
cannot make friends with Dick, and Harry
will go back to school. Indoors I have
nothing to do ; but I am going to ask
Uncle James, and then if I go to the
cottages and get the children together a
little, perhaps it may be better than nothing.
Old nurse says they all grow up bad.
Poor things, how can they help it ! "

"Well, Queene," said Ruth dubiously,
I don't think the people are very fit for
you to go to. I don't think Uncle Seyton
would like it."

"I should not be afraid of them," said
Virginia. " It would be doing something
for papa, and doing good besides."

To think of her father as an involuntary
victim to the faults of others was the one
refuge of Virginia's heart; his graceful,
melancholy gentleness had caught her fancy,
and she was filled with a pity which, however
strange from a child to a father, vibrated
in every tender string of her nature.
On the other hand, all her notions of right

were outraged by the more obvious evils
prevailing at Elderthwaite, and she went
through in those first weeks a variety of
emotions, for which action seemed the only
cure. She felt as if the sins of generations
lay 'on her father's shoulders, and she
wanted to pull them on to her own 
wanted to stand in the deadly breach with
the little weapon that her small experience
had put into her hand. She wanted to
teach a few poor children, a thing that
might only be a pleasant occupation or the
most commonplace of duties. But it was
turning her face right round on the smooth
slope the Seytons were treading, and trying
to make a step up hill.

Ruth did not think that first step would
be easy, and would have liked to see
Virginia go downstairs in a somewhat
less desperate humour, to find her uncle
chatting to Miss Seyton in the drawing-room.


Ha, ha. Miss Ruth ! Come North justin
time to make a conquest of the fine
Frenchman at Oakby."

'' I thought he was a Spaniard, uncle,"
said E/Uth.

Eh, pretty much of a muchness, aren't
they ? I've got a card for a grand ball to
go and see him. Ha, ha ! I'd sooner see
him with a red coat on at Ashrigg meet
next Thursday."

But you must go to the ball, uncle,
and dance with me," said Hath.

'* That's a bargain," said the jolly
parson, striking his hands together.
'' Any dance I like ? "

'' To be sure."

Ah, mind you look out, then. When
you're sitting quiet with the Frenchman
you'll see your old uncle round the
corner."

I never dance with any one who doesn't
know the trois tones, uncle."

'' Bless my soul ! My favourite dance
is the hornpipe, or old Sir Roger  kiss
the girls as you pop under. That's an old
parson's privilege, you know."

All this time Virginia had been standing
apart, working up her courage, and now.

regardless of the unities of conversation,
and with a now-or-never feeling, she
began, her fresh young voice trembling
and her colour rising high .

'uncle James, if you please. I wanted
to tell you I shall be very glad to do
anything to help you, if you will allow
me."

"Help me, my dear? Teach me the
troy tong, or whatever Ruth calls it ? "

To help you in the parish, uncle."

'' Parish ? Ha, ha ! Do they have the
pretty girls to read prayers in the grand
Ritualistic places nowadays ? "

I thought I might perhaps teach some
of the children," faltered poor Virginia
through her uncle's peal of laughter.

Teach ? We don't have many newfangled
notions here, my dear. Do your
wool-work, and dance your trois long, and
mind your own business."

'' I have always been accustomed to do
something useful," said Virginia, gaining
courage from indignation.

Now look here, Virginia," said Parson

Seyton emphatically. *' Don't yon go
putting your finger into a pie you know
nothing of. There's not a cottage in the
place fit for a young lady to set her foot
in. There's a vast deal too much of young
women's meddling in these days ; and as
for Elderthwaite, there's an old Method,
as they call him, who groans away to the
soberer folks, and comforts their hearts
in his own fashion. What could a chit of
a lass like you do for them ? Go and
captivate the Frenchman with your round
eyes  you've a grand pair of them  and
give me a kiss."

Parson Seyton put out his hand and
drew her towards him.

"But, uncle," she stammered, yielding to
the kiss in such utter confusion of mind
that she hardly knew what she was doing
'' But, uncle, do you lie that Methodist
to  to attract the people ? "

Bless your heart, child, people must
have their religion their own way. They'd
stare to hear me convicting them of
their sins. ' What's the parson done with

his own ? ' they'd ask. But it comforts
them Hke blankets and broth, and it's
little they get of either," with a side
glance at his sister ; " so I take good care
to keep out of the way. I told Cherry
Lester I should go and hear him some
Sunday afternoon. ' Hope it would do
you good, parson,' says he, coolly. Eh,
he's a fine lad. What a confounded fool
old Lester must think himself to have this
foreign fellow ready to step into his place."

Are you and Cheriton as great friends
as ever, uncle?" asked Ruth.

Friends ! Oh, he's like Virginia here.
Wants to teach me a lesson now and then.
Got me over last year to their grand meeting
of clergy and laity for educational
purposes, and there I was up on the platform
with the best of them."

Did you make a speech, uncle ? " asked
Ruth.

I did, my lass, I did ! When they had
quarrelled and disputed, and couldn't by
any means agree, some one asked my
opinion, and I said, ' My lord,'  Lord 

was there, sou know,  ' and my reverend
brethren, having no knowledge whatever
of the subject, I have no opinion to give.'
And old Harold  he comes from the
other side of the county, mind you, 
remarked that ' Mr. Sey ton's old-fashioned
wisdom might find followers with advantage.'
Ha  ha  you should have seen
Cherry's blue eyes down below on the
benches when I gave him a wink ! ' Old-fashioned
wisdom,' Miss Virginia; don't
you despise it."

Hallo, uncle ! shouted Harry, putting
his head in, '' here's a fellow come tearing"
up to say the wedding's waited an hour,
and if the parson isn't quick they'll do
without him."

Bless my soul, I forgot all about 'em;
Coming  coming  and I'll give 'em a
couple of rabbits for the wedding dinner.
Virginia '11 never ask me to marry her,
that's certain." And off strode the parson,
while poor Virginia, scandalized and
perplexed as she was, was fain, like everyone
else, to laugh at him.

CHAPTER X.

THE OLD Parson.

He gave not of that text a pulled hen
That saith that hunters ben not holy men."

Perhaps no amount of angry opposition to
lier wishes could so have perplexed Virginia
as her uncle's nonchalance, which,
whether cynical or genial, seemed to remove
him from the ranks of responsible
beings, and to make him a law unto himself.
When we read of young high-souled
martyrs, we are apt to fancy that their
way was plain before them ; that however
hard to their flesh, it was at least clear to
their spirit; that Agnes or Cecilia, however
much afflicted by the wickedness of
their adversaries, were never perplexed by
anything in them that was perhaps not

wicked. Virginia Seyton was full of desires
as pure, wishes as warm to lead the
higher life, was capable of as much ' enthusiasm
of humanity" as any maiden who
defied torture and death ; but she was
confronted by a kind of difficulty that
made her feel like a naughty girl ; the
means to fulfil her purpose were open to
so much objection that she could hardly
hold firmly to the end in view. It may
seem a very old difficulty, but it came upon
her as a startling surprise that so much
evil could be permitted by those who were
not altogether devoid of good. For she
was inclined to be sorry for this jolly,
genial uncle, and not to wish to vex him ;
while yet his every practice and sentiment
was such as she had been rightly taught to
disapprove.

Anxious for a chance of settling her
confused ideas, she slipped away by herself,
and went out into the muddy lanes,
heedless of a fast-falling shower.

The thaw had set in rapidly, and rich
tints of brown, green, and yellow succeeded

to the cold whiteness of the snow
on moor and hill-side. A thaw, when the
snow has fairly gone, even in the depth of
winter, has a certain likeness to spring;
the violent, buffeting wind was warm and
soft, and the sky, instead of one pale sheet
of blue, showed every variety of wild rain-cloud
and driven mist.

Virginia plunged on through the mud
with a perplexity in her soul as blinding
as the tears that rose and confused the
landscape already half-blotted out by
wreaths of mountain mist. Suddenly, as
she turned a corner, something bounced
up against her, nearly knocking her down,
and a voice exclaimed, 

Down, Ella ! How dare you, sir !
Oh, dear me, how sorry I am ! that great
brute has covered you with mud;" and
Cheriton Lester, very muddy himself, and
holding by the neck an object hardly recognizable
as Buffer, appeared before her.

*' I was very muddy before," said Virginia.
" Why, what has happened to the
puppy?"

''He fell into the ditch. Nettie will
wash him ; it's her favourite amusement.
I was coming up here to ask after a young
fellow I knovsj who works at this farm;
he hasn't been going on very well lately."

I suppose you know every one in
Oakby," said Virginia, abruptly.

Pretty well," answered Cherry. " I
couldn't help doing so."

I should like to know the people in
Elderthwaite," said Virginia.

It would be a very good thing for some
of them if you did."

Ah ! " she said, suddenly, " but Uncle
James will not let me do so."

Ah ! " said Cherry, with an inflection
in his voice that Virginia did not understand.
Then he added quickly, " What
did you want to do ? "

I wanted," said Virginia, moved, she
hardly knew why, to confidence as they
walked on side by side, " to go to the cottages
sometimes, and perhaps teach some
of the children. Don't you think it would
be right? "

VOL. I. M

I think it would hardly do for you to go
about at haphazard among the cottagers."

'' But why ? I am used to poor people,"
said Virginia.

Her sentences were short, because she
was afraid of letting her voice tremble ; but
she looked at him earnestly, and how could
he tell her that many of the people whom
she wished to benefit owed her family
grudges deep enough to make her unwelcome
within their walls, how betray to her
that the revelations they might make to
her would affect her relations to her own
family more than she could hope to affect
their lives in return. But Cheriton was
never deaf to other people's troubles, and
lie answered with great gentleness 

*' Because we're a rough set up here in
the North, and they would scarcely understand
your kind motives. But the children
  I wish you could get hold of them ! I
do wish something could be done for them.
What did the old parson say to you ? "

"He said he didn't approve of education."

Oh, that's no matter at all ! I declare

I think I see how you might do it, and we'll
make the parson hunt up a class for sou
himself ! What ! you don't believe me ?
You will see. Could you go down to the
vicarage on Sunday mornings ? "

Oh, yes ! but Uncle James  "

Oh, I'll make him come round. They
might send over some benches from Oakland
the children would do very well in the
vicarage hall."

But, Cheriton," exclaimed the astonished
Virginia, " you can't hioio what my
uncle said about it ! "

He said, ' Eh, they're a bad lot. No
use meddling with them,' didn't he ? "
said Cheriton, in the very tone of the old
parson.

'' Something like it."

Never mind. He would like to see
them a better lot in his heart, as well as
you or I would."

Ruth says he is really very kind," said
Virginia; *' and I think he means to be."

Ah, yes, your cousin knows all our odd
ways, you know. She is with you ? "

M 2

Yes, she came yesterday."

*' All I lie knows that he is a very kind
old boy. He loves every stone in Elder-thwart,
and you would be surprised to find
how fond some of the people are of him.
Now I'll go and see him, and come and tell
you what he says. May I ? "

To be sure' said Virginia, ' and perhaps
then Aunt Julia will not object."

'' Oh, no, not to this plan'* said Cherry.

He called Rolla, and went in search of
the parson.

Cherry liked management ; it was partly
the inheritance of his father's desire for
influence, and partly his tender and genial
nature, which made him take so much
interest in people as to enjoy having a
finger in every pie. As he walked along,
he contrived every detail of his plan.

Jack was wont to observe that Elder-thwart
was a blot on the face of the earth,
and a disgrace to any system, ecclesiastical
or political, that rendered it possible. But
then Jack was much devoted to his young
house-master, and wrote essays for his

benefit, one of wliicli was entitled, '' On
the Evils inherent in every existing Form
of Government," so that he felt it consistent
to be critical. Cheriton had a soft
spot in his heart for a long existing form
of anything.

He soon arrived at the vicarage, a picturesque
old house, built half of stone and
half of black and white plaster. It was
large, with great overgrown stables and
farm-buildings, all much out of repair.
Cheriton found the parson sitting in the
old oak dining-room before a blazing fire,
smoking his pipe. Some remains of luncheon
were on the table, and the parson
was evidently enjoying a glass of something
hot after it. Cheriton entered with
little ceremony.

How d'ye do. Parson ? " he said.

Ha, Cherry ! how d'ye do, my lad ? Sit
down and have some lunch. What d'ye take?
there's a glass of port in the sideboard."

Thanks, I'd rather have a glass of beer
and some Stilton," said Cherry, seating
himself.

As lie spoke, a little bit of an old woman
came in with some cold pheasant and a jug
of beer, wliicli lie placed before him. She
was wrinkled up almost to nothing, but
her steps were active enough, and she had
lived with Parson Seyton all his life.

Ay, Deborah knows your tastes. And
what do you want of me ? "

I want to give you a lecture. Parson,"
said Cherry coolly.

'' The deuce you do ? Out with it, then."

' Virginia has been telling me that you
will not let her teach the little kids on a
Sunday."

Bless my soul, Cheriton ! d'ye think
I'm going to let the girl run all over the
place and hear tales of her father and
brothers, and may be of myself into the
bargain? "

No," said Cherry; " but you ought to
be very much obliged to her. Parson. Ita
shame to see those little ruffians. Now
you're going to call on half-a-dozen
decentish people and tell them to send
their children down here of a Sunday

morning at ten o'clock. Yirginia will
teach them in the hall. 1*11 get them to
send over a couple of forms from Oakby.
Don't let her begin with above a dozen,
and don't have any big boys at first.
Deborah might give them a bit of cake
now and again to make the lessons go
down. What do you say ? "

I say you're the coolest hand in
"Westmoreland, and enough to wile the
flounders out of the frith ! " said the old
parson, as Cherry peeped at him over his
shoulder to see the effect of his words.

What are we coming to ? "

''A model school, perhaps."

"And a model parson. Eh, Cherry,
these enlightened days can't do with the
old lot much longer."

Oh, you're moving with the times,"
said Cherry, as he came and stood with
his back to the fire, looking down at the
parson as he filled his pipe, and smiling at
him. Perhaps no other being in the world
could have got Parson Seyton to consent
to such an innovation, but he loved

Cheriton Lester, who little knew low
much self-respect the allegiance of his
high-principled promising youth was worth
to the queer old sporting parson. One
atom of pretence or of priggishness in a
well-conducted correct young man would
have been of all things odious to him, but
the shrewd old man believed in Cheriton
to the backbone, and of all the admiration
and affection that the popular young man
had won perhaps none did him so much
credit as the love that made him a sort of
good angel to rough Parson Seyton.

You got my best dog out of me when
I gave you Rolla," he said, " so I suppose
you'll have your own way now."

And it'll turn out quite as well as
Rolla," said Cherry rather illogically.

Parson Seyton set about fulfilling his
promise after a manner of his own.

He rapped with his dog-whip at a
cottage door and thus addressed the
mother : 

'* Eh, Betty, there's a grand new start
in Elderthwaite. Here's Miss Virginia

going to turn all the children into first-rate
scholars. Wash them up and send them
over to my house on Sunday morning, and
I'll give a penny to the cleanest, and a
licking to any one that doesn't mind his
manners."

If Parson Seyton had been a school-board
visitor he could hardly have put the
matter more plainly, and on the whole
could hardly have adopted language more
likely to be effectual.

CHAPTER XI.

Alva CONFIDENTIAL.

'' He talked of daggers and of darts,
Of passions and of pains."

The rain had ceased, and long pale rays of
sunshine were streaming through the mist
as Cheriton made his way through a very
dilapidated turnstile and across a footpath
much in need of drainage towards Elder-thwart
House. As he came up through
the overgrown shrubberies he saw in front
of him a small fur clothed figure, and his
colour deepened and his heart beat faster
as he recognized Ruth. He had been
thinking that he should see her ever since
his promise to Virginia, but he had not
expected to meet her out-of-doors on so

wet a day, and lie had hardly a word to
say as he lifted his hat and came up to her.
She was less discomposed, perhaps less
astonished.

'' Ah! how do you do ? " she said. '* Do
you know when I saw some one coming I
hoped it might be your new brother. I
am so curious to see him."

He is not a bit like any of us," said
Cherry.

*' No ? That would be a change, for all
you Lesters are so exactly alike."

E-uth had a way of saying saucy things
in a soft serious voice, with grave eyes
just ready to laugh. Cheriton and she
had had many a passage of arms together,
and now he rallied his forces and
answered, 

Being new, of course he'll be charming.
Rupert and Jack and I will know all our
partners are longing for him. But as he
can only dance with one young lady at a
time, in the intervals I shall hope  I am
much improved in my waltzing  just to
get a turn,"

"Really improved  at last?" said Ruth;
then suddenly changing to sympathy 
"But isn't it very strange for you all?
How do you get on ? How do you like
him?"

Oh, he isn't half a bad fellow, and we're
excellent friends."

That's very good of you. Now I have
such a bad disposition that if I were in
your place I should be half mad with
jealousy."

Cheriton laughed incredulously.

*' I daresay you would stroke us all
down the right way. Eupert says he feels
as if he were lighting his cigar in a powder-magazine.
But they get on verj'- well, and
Grace and Mary Cheriton think him perfectly
charming."

I think I shall come to the ball in a
mantilla. But have you done anything
for poor Virginia ? "

*' Oh, yes; the old parson only wanted a
little explanation," said Cherry, quite carelessly
enough to encourage Ruth in adding
earnestly, 

'rit is SO good of lier to want to help
these poor people. Queenie is like a girl
in a book. I really think lie likes disagreeable
duties."

I am sure you, who can sympathize
with Virginia and yet know all the troubles,
will be able to make it smooth for her. T
wish you would."

Ah, but I am not nearly so good as
Virginia," said Ruth  a perfectly true
statement, which she herself believed.
Whether she expected Cheriton to believe
it was a different matter.

Alvar had no excuse now for finding
Oakby dull ; the house was full of people,
Lady Cheriton and her daughters were
enchanted with his music, and he brightened
up considerably and was off Cheriton's
mind, so that nothing spoilt the radiance
of enjoyment that transfigured all the
commonplace gaiety into a fairy dream.
The younger ones found the times less
good. Jack was shy and bored by fine
people, Bob hated his dress clothes, Nettie
was teased by Rupert, who varied between

treating her as a Tomboy and flattering her
as an incipient beauty, and thought her
grandmother's restrictions to white muslin
and hie ribbons hard. But Mrs. Lester
had no notion of letting her forestall her
career as a county beauty.

When Cheriton came back from Elder-thwart
he found the whole party by the
hall fire in the full tide of discussion and
chatter, Nettie on the rug with Buffer
in her arms complaining of the white
muslin.

Shan't I look horrid, Eupert ?"

'frightful; but as you'll be sure to
bring Buffer into the ball-room he'd tear
anything more magnificent."

I shan't bring in Buffer ! Rupert,
what an idea ! He'll be shut up, poor
darling ! But at least I may turn up my
hair, and I shall. I'm quite tall enough."

Turn your hair up ? Don't you do
anything of the sort, Nettie. Little girls
are fashionable, and yellow manes and
muslin frocks will carry the day against
wreaths and silk dresses. You let your

hair alone, and then people will know it's
all real by-and-by."

Well, I'd much rather turn it up,"
said Nettie simply.

'' Well, perhaps I would," said Eupert.
Fellows might say you let it down on
purpose."

Rupert conveyed a great deal of admiration
of the golden locks in his tone, but
Nettie, though vain enough, was insensible
to veiled flattery.

"Plait it up, Nettie," said Cherry
briefly.

If anybody thought I did such a nasty,
mean, affected thing as that I'd never
speak to him again. Never ! I'd cut it
all ofl* sooner," cried Nettie.

'' Young ladies' hair does come down
sometimes," said Rupert ; '* when it's long
enough."

Mine never shall," said Nettie emphatically.


Don't do it yourself, then," said
Cherry.

'' If Nettie ever takes to horrid, affected,

flirting ways," said Jack, who had joined
the party, '' I for one shall have nothing
more to say to her."

'you don't admire flirts. Jack?" said
Expert.

I don't approve of them," said Jack
crossly.

Oh, come, come, now. Jack, that's
very severe."

Poor Jack ! " said Cherry ; ''he speaks
from personal experience. There was that
heartless girl last summer, who, after hours
of serious conversation with him, went off*
to play croquet with Tom Hubbard, and
gave him a moss-rosebud. Poor Jack !
it was a blow ; he can't recover from it !
It has affected all his views of life, you see."

"Poor fellow!" said Eupert, as Jack
forcibly stopped Cherry's mouth; "I'd no
notion it was a personal matter. Will she
be at the ball?"

No; you see, we avoided asking her."

Cherry ! " interposed the disgusted
Jack, " how can you go on in this way !
It's all his humbug, Rupert."

This serious denial produced, of course,
shouts of laughter  in the midst of
which Alvar entered and joined himself
to the group round the fire as they
waited for the arrival of some friends of
Cheriton's.

'rand what have you been about?"
asked Cherry.

'' I have been singing with your cousins.
Ah, it is pleasant when there are those
who like music ! "

You found all these fellows awful
savages, didn't you?" said Rupert.

Alvar turned his great dark eyes on
Cheriton with the same sort of expression
with which Rolla was wont to watch him.

Ah, no," he said; '' my brother is nota
savage. But I do like young ladies."

'' But I thought," said Rupert, '' that in
Spain young ladies were always under a
duenna, so that there was no chance of an
afternoon over the piano ?"

But I assure you Miladi Cheriton was
present," said Alvar seriously.

Oh, that alters the question ! " said

VOL. I. N

Rupert. " But come, now, we have been
hearing Jack's views  let us have your
confessions. Is the duenna akvays there,
Alvar ? "

Here is my sister," said Alvar, with
the oddest sort of simplicity, and yet with
a tone that conveyed a sort of reproach to
Rupert and  for the first time  of proprietorship
in Nettie.

Rupert burst into a shout of laughter :
'' My dear fellow, what are you going to
tell us?"

'' She is a young girl ; surely even here
you do not say everything to her ? " said
Alvar, looking perplexed.

'' By Jove, no ! " said Rupert ; '' not
exactly."

Since Nettie is here, we should not
have asked you to tell us anything we did
not wish her to hear," said Cheriton, wdtli
a sense of annoyance that Alvar should be
laughed at.

You did not ask me," said Alvar
quietly.

At this moment Bob called Nettie so

emphatically, that she was obliged unwillingly
to go away.

Now then, Alvar," said Rupert, '' now
for it. We won't be shocked. Tell us
how you work the duennas."

It would not have been well to explain
that to Nettie," said Alvar seriously.

'why not?" said Jack, suddenly boiling
up. " Do you think she would ever
cheat or want a duenna? Enghsli girls
can always be trusted !"

Can they ? " said Rupert. " Shut up,
Jack; you don't understand. We only
want you to tell us how you do in Spain.
Affaires du coeur  you know, Alvar."

Alvar looked round with an air lialf-
shrewd, half sentimental ; while Cheriton
listened a little seriously. He knew very
Httle of Alvar's former life; perhaps because
he had been too reticent to ask him
questions; perhaps because Alvar found
himself in the presence of a standard
higher than he was accustomed to. Anyway,
Nettie might have heard his present
revelations.

N 2

There was a time," he said, sighing,
*' when I did not intend to come to England
 when I had sworn to be for ever a
Spaniard. Ah, my cousin, if you had seen
my Luisa, you would not have wondered.
I sang under her window ; I went to mass
that I might gaze on her."

'did you now? Foreign customs!"
interposed Rupert ; while Cherry laughed,
though he felt they were hardly treating
Alvar fairly.

I knew not how to speak to her. She
was never alone ; and it was whispered
that she was already betrothed. But one
day she dropped her fan."

''No, no  surely ? " said Cherry.

I seized it, I kissed it, I held it to my
heart," said Alvar, evidently enjoying the
narration, " and I returned it. There were
looks between us  then words. Ah, I
lived in her smiles. We met, we exchanged
vows, and I was happy ! "

Rupert listened to this speech with
amusement, which he could hardly stifle.
It was inexpressibly ludicrous to Cheriton ;

but the fun was lost in the wonder whether
Alvar meant what he said. This was
neither like the joking sentiment nor the
pretended indifference of an Englishman's
reference to such passages in his Hfe ; jet
the memory evidently cost Alvar no pain.
Jack sat, looking totally disgusted.

'' At last," Alvar went on, " we were
discovered. Ah, and then my grandfather
was enraged, and her parents, they refused
their consent, since she was betrothed
already. I am an Englishman, and T do
not weep when T am grieved, but my heart
was a stone. I despaired."

She must have been a horrid little flirt
not to tell you she was engaged," said Jack.

'' She did not know it till we had met,"
said Alvar.

What awful tyranny ! "

'' Ah, and she was your only love ! "
sighed Rupert.

No," said Alvar simply, '* I have loved
others; but she was the most beautiful.
But I submitted, and now I forget her ! "

Hm  the truest wisdom," said Rupert.

Cherry was growing angry. He did not
think that Rupert had any business to
make fun of Alvar, and he was in a rage
with Alvar for making himself ridiculous.
That Alvar should tell a true love-tale with
sentimental satisfaction to an admiring
audience, or sigh over a flirtation which
ought to have been a good joke, was
equally distasteful to him. He burst out
suddenly, with all his Lester bluntness,
and in a tone which Alvar had hitherto
heard only from Jack, 

If you fellows are not all tired of talking
such intolerable nonsense, I am. It's
too bad of you, with a sharp look at
Eupert. '' I don't see that it's any affair
of ours."

'' You're not sympathetic," said Eupert,
as he moved away ; for he was quite familiar
enough with his cousins for such giving
and taking.

CHAPTER XII.

THE OAKBT BALL.

She went to the ball, and she danced with the handsome
prince."

That week of gaiety, so unusual to Oakbj,
was fraught with great results. The dim
and beautiful dream of the future which
had grown with Cheriton Lester's growth
became a definite purpose. Ruth Seyton
was his first love, almost his first fancy.
Whatever other sentiments and flirtations
had come across him, had been as light as
air ; he had loved Ruth ever since he had
taught her to ride, and since she had tried
to teach him to dance. He had always
found her ready to talk to him of the
thoughts and aspirations which found no

sympathy at home, and still more ready to
tease him about them. She was part of
the dear and sacred home affections, the
long accustomed life which held so powerful
a sway over him, and she was besides a
wonderful and beautiful thing, peculiar to
himself, and belonging to none of the
others.

He had not seen her since the season
when he had met her in town with Virginia
; he did not know very much really
about her, but she was kind and gracious
to him, and he walked about in a dream of
bliss which made every commonplace duty
and gaiety delightful. Ruth was mixed up
in it all, it was all in her honour; and
though Cheriton's memory at this time
was not to be depended on, he had spirits
for any amount of the hard work of preparation,
and a laugh for every disagreeable.


He regarded his tongue as tied till after
he had taken his degree in the summer 
he hoped with credit ; after which his prospects
at the bar with Judge Cheriton's

interest, were somewhat less obscure than
those of most young men. He had inherited
some small fortune from his
mother, and though he could not consider
himself a brilliant match for Miss Seyton,
he would then feel himself justified in putting
his claims forward. Many spoke with
admiration of the entire absence of jealousy
which made him take the second place so
easily; but Cheriton hardly deserved the
praise, he had no room in his mind to
think of himself at all.

His cousin Rupert was a more recent
acquaintance of Ruth's, though matters
had gone much further between them.
His attentions had not been encouraged
by her grandmother, as, though his fortune
was far superior to anything Cheriton
possessed, his affairs were supposed to be
considerably involved, and this was so far
true, that it would have been very inconvenient
to him to lay them open to inquiry
at present. He hoped, however, in the
course of a few months to be able so to
arrange them, as to make it possible to

apply to Ruth Sey ton's guardians for their
consent.

Rupert was a lively, pleasant fellow, with
a considerable regard for his Oakby
cousins, though he had never considered it
necessary to regulate his life by the Oakby
standard, or concerned himself greatly
with its main principles. His life in the
army had of course been quite apart from
Cheriton's at school and college, and the
latter did not care to realize how far the
elder cousin, once a model in his eyes, had
grown away from him. Nor did he regard
him as a rival.

Ruth gave smiles and dances to himself,
and he little guessed that while he did his
duty joyously in other directions, looking
forward to his next word with her, she
had given his cousin a distinct promise, and
engaged to keep it secret till such time ashe
chose to ask for her openly. Perhaps
Rupert could not be expected to scruple at
such a step, when he knew how entirely
Ruth had managed her affairs for herself in
all her intercourse with him.

And as for Ruth she rejoiced in the
chance of making a sacrifice to prove her
love ; and whether the sacrifice was of
other people's feelings, her own ease and
comfort, or of any little trifling scruples of
conscience, ought, she considered, to be
equally unimportant. " Love must still be
lord of all," but the love that loves honour
more was in her eyes weak and unworthy.
Faults in the hero only proved the strength
of his manhood ; faults in herself were all
condoned by her love.

E/uth was clever enough to pitt into
words the inspiring principles of a great
many books that she read, and a great deal
of talk that she heard, and vehement
enough to act up to it. Rupert, who had
no desire to be at all unlike other people,
had little notion of the glamour of enthusiasm
with which Ruth plighted him her
troth at Oakby.

The Lesters had expended much abuse
on the morning of their ball on the
blackness of the oak-panels, which no
amount of wax candles would overcome

but what was lost in gaiety was gained in
picturesque ness, and the Oakby ball, with
its handsome hosts and its distinguished
company, was long quoted as the prettiest
in the neighbourhood. Perhaps it owed
no little of its charm to the one in whose
honour it was given. Alvar in society was
neither silent nor languid ; he was a splendid
dancer, and played the host with a
foreign grace that enchanted the ladies, old
and young. At the dinner-party the night
before he had been silent and stately, evidently
fearing to commit himself before the
country gentlemen and county grandees,
who were such strange specimens of humanity
to him ; but with their daughters
it was different, and those were happy
maidens who danced with the stranger.
He was of course duly instructed whom he
was thus to honour, but he found time
to exercise his own choice, and Virginia
was conscious that he paid her marked
attention.

Why waste more words ? She had found
her fate, and softened with home troubles,

attracted by the superiority of the Lesters,
and dazzled with the charm of a manner
and appearance never seen before, yet
suiting all her girlish dreams of heroic
perfection, she was giving her heart away
to the last man whose previous training
or present character was likely really to
accord with her own.

Though she had never been an acknowledged
beauty, she could often look beautiful,
and the subtle excitement of half-conscious
triumph was not wanting to
complete the charm.

'' There never had been such a pleasant
ball," said Cheriton the next morning,
as he was forced to hurry away to Oxford
without a chance of discussing its
delights.

*' It is indeed possible to dance in
England," said Alvar.

I think we made it out very well,"
said Rupert, with a smile under his moustaches.


'' There are balls  and balls," said Ruth
to her cousin. " You don't always have

black oak, or black Spanisli eyes, eb,
Queeiiie ? or some other tidings ? "

And Virginia blusliecl and said nothing.

Nettie, after all, bad rejoiced in the
partners of wbicli ber white frock and
plaited air bad not defrauded ber (whenever
should forgive ber air for coming
down in Rupert's very sight in the last
waltz). Jack bad not been so miserable as
be expected ; and Alvar found that it was
possible to enjoy life in England, and that
the position awaiting bim there was not to
be despised, even in the face of parting
from bis beloved Cberiton.

Rupert by no means considered Alvar
as an amusing companion, nor Oakby in
the dull season an amusing place, but it
suited bim now to spend bis leave there,
and suited bim also to be intimate at
Eldertbwaite. Consequently be encouraged
Alvar to make excuses for going
there, and certainly in finding some interests
to supply Cberiton's place. He
cultivated Dick Seyton, wbo was of an
age to appreciate a grown-up man's attentions,

SO that altogether there was more
intercourse between the two houses than
had taken place since the clays of Roland.

Ruth was paying a long visit at Elder-thwart.
One of her aunts  her grandmother's
youngest and favourite child 
was in bad health, and Lady Charlton was
glad to spend some time with her and to
be free from the necessity of chaperoning
her granddaughter. The arrangement
suited Ruth exactly. She could make
Elderthwaite her head-quarters, pay several
visits among friends in the north, and find
opportunities of meeting Rupert, whose
regiment was stationed at York, and who
was consequently within reach of many
north country gaieties.

For the present no gaieties were needed
by either to enliven the wintry woods of
Elderthwaite; they were as fairy land to
the little brown maiden who, among their
bare stems and withered ferns found, as
she believed, the very flower of life, and
had no memory for the bewitching smiles,
the soft, half-sentimental laughter, the

many dances, and the preference hardly
disguised wliicli were the food of Cheriton's
memory, and gave him an object
wliicli lightened every uncongenial task.
These little wiles had effectually prevented
every one from guessing the real state of
the case. Eupert's difficulty was that he
never could be sure how far Alvar was
unsuspicious. There was a certain blankness
in his way of receiving remarks, calculated
to prevent suspicion, which might
proceed from entire innocence, or from
secret observation which he did not choose
to betray. But he was always willing to
accompany Rupert to Elderthwaite, and in
Cheriton's absence found Virginia by far
his most congenial companion.

The amount of confidence already existing
between Ruth and her cousin really
rendered the latter unsuspicious, and ready
to further intercourse with Rupert, believing
Ruth to be in a doubtful state of mind,
half encouraging, and half avoiding his
attentions. And Ruth was very cautious ;
she never allowed Rupert to monopolize

her during this ostensible visits, and i
any one at Elderthwaite guessed at their
stolen interviews, it was certainly not
Virginia.

The scheme of the Sunday class had
answered pretty well. Virginia knew how
to teach, and though her pupils were rough,
the novelty of her grace and gentleness
made some impression on them.

The parson did not interfere with her,
and it never occurred to her that he was
within hearing, till one Sunday, as she
tried to tell them the simplest facts in language
sufficiently plain to be understood,
and sufficiently striking to be interesting,
and felt, by the noise on the back benches,
that she was entirely failing to do so, a
head appeared at the dining-room door,
and a stentorian voice exclaimed, 

Bless my soul, you young ruffians ; is
this the way to behave to Miss Seyton ?
If any lad can't show respect to a lady in
my house, out he'll go, and, by George
he won't come in again."

This unwonted address produced an as-vol.

1.

finished silence ; but it frightened the
teacher so much' more than her class, that
her only resource was to call on the more
advanced ones with great solemnity " to
say their hymn to the vicar."

Parson Seyton straightened himself up,
and Hastened in silence to 

There is a green hill far away,"

stumbled through in the broadest Westmoreland
; and when it was over, remarked,


Very pretty verses. Lads and lasses,
keep your feet still and attend to Miss
Seyton, and  mind  I can hear ye," a
piece of information with which Virginia
at any rate could well have dispensed.

But she was getting used to her rough
uncle, and was grateful to Cheriton for the
advice that he had given her, and so she
told'Alvar one day when they were all
walking down to the vicarage, with the
ostensible purpose of showing Nettie some
enormous mastiff puppies, the pride of the
vicar's heart.

In the absence of her own brothers
Nettie found Dick Seyton an amusing
companion, *' soft " though he might be ;
she began by daring him to jump over
ditches as well as she could, and ended by
finding that he roused in her unsuspected
powers of repartee. Nettie found the Miss
Ellesmeress dull companions ; they were a
great deal cleverer than she was, and
expected her to read story books, and care
about the people in them. Rupert and Dick
found that her ignorance made her none the
less amusing, and took care to tell her so.

So everything combined to make intercourse
easy ; and this was not the first
walk that the six young people had taken
together.

Your brother," said Virginia to Alvar,
was very kind to me. I should never
have got on so well but for his advice.

My brother is always kind," said
Alvar, his eyes fighting up. "I cannot
tell you how well I love him."

I am sure you do," said Virginia
heartily, though unable to help smiling


But in what was it that he helped
you ? " asked Alvar.

Virginia explained how he had persuaded
her uncle to agree to her wishes about
teaching the children.

*' To teach the ignorant?" said Alvar,
Ah, that is the work of a saint ! "

Oh, no ! I like doing it. It is nothing
but what many girls can do much
better."

Ah, this country is strange. In Spain
the young ladies remain at home. They
go nowhere but to mass. If my sister
were in Spain she would not jump over
the ditches, nor run after the dogs,"
glancing at Nettie, who was inciting
Holly to run for a piece of stick.

Do you think us very shocking ? " said
Virginia demurely.

Nay," said Alvar. " These are your
customs, and I am happy since they permit
me the honour of walking by your side,
and talking with you. You, like my
brother, are kind to the stranger."

But you must leave off calling yourself

a stranger. You too are English ; can you
not feel yourself so ? "

Yes, 1 am an Englishman," said Alvar.
See, if I stay here, I have money and
honour. My father speaks to me of a
position in the county.' That is to be a
great man as I understand it. Nor are
there parties here to throw down one
person, and then another. In Spain,
though not less noble, we are poor,
and all things change quickly, and I
shall not stay always here in Oakby. I
am going to London, and I see that I
can make for myself a life that pleases
me."

Yet you love Spain best ? "

I love Spain," said Alvar, " the sunshine
and the country; but I am no
Spaniard. No, I stayed away from England
because it was my belief that my
father did not love me. I was wrong. I
have a right to be here ; it was my right
to come here long ago, and my right I will
not give up ! "

He drew himself up with an indescribable

air of hauteur for a moment, then with
sudden softness, 

And who was it that saw that right
and longed for me to come, who opened
his heart to me ? It was Cheriton, my
brother. He has explained much to me,
and says if I learn to love England it will
make him happy. And I will love it for
his sake."

"I hope so ; soon you will not find it so
dull."

Nay, it is not now so dull. Have I
not the happiness of your sympathy ?
Could I be dull to-day ? " said Alvar, with
his winning grace.

Virginia blushed, and her great eyes
drooped, unready with a reply.

And there is your cousin," she said,
shyly ; * Hie is a companion ; don't you
think him like Cheriton ? "

Yes, a little ; but Cheriton is like an
angel, though he will not have me say so ;
but Rupert, he has the devil in his face.
But I like him  he is a nice fellow 
very nice," said Alvar, the bit of English

idiom sounding oddly in his foreign
tones.

Virginia laughed, spite of herself.

Ah, I make you laugh," said Alvar.
I wish I had attended more to my English
lessons ; but there was a time when it
was not my intention to come to England,
and I did not study. I am not like
Cheriton and Jack, I do not love to study.
It is very pleasant to smoke, and to do
nothing ; but I see it is not the custom
here, and it is better, I think, to be like
my brother."

Some people are rather fond of
smoking and doing nothing even in
England."

It is a different sort of doing nothing.
I hear my father or Cheriton rebuke Bob
for doing nothing ; but then he is out of
doors with some little animal in a bag 
his ferret, I think it is called  to catch the
rats ; or he runs and gets hot ; that is
what he calls doing nothing."

There was a sort of bonhommie in Alvar' s
way of describing himself and his surroundings,

and a charm in his manner which,
added to a pair of eyes full of fire and
expression, and a great deal of implied
admiration for herself, produced no small
effect on Virginia.

She saw that he was affectionate and
ready to recognize the good in his brothers,
and she knew that he had been deprived
of his due share of home affection. She
did not doubt that he was willing himself
to do and to be all that he admired ; and
then he was not boyish and blunt like
his brothers, nor so full of mischief as
Cheriton, nor with that indescribable want
of something that made her wonder at
Rupert's charm in the eyes of Eutli ; she
had never seen any one like him.

She glanced up in his face with eyes that
all unconsciously expressed her thoughts,
and as he turned to her with a smile they
came up to the vicarage garden, at the
gate of which stood Parson Seyton talking
to Mr. Lester, who was on horseback
beside him.

Ha, squire," said the parson, " Monsieur

Alvar is a dangerous fellow among
the lasses. Black eyes and foreign ways
have made havoc with hearts all the world
over."

Mr. Lester looked towards the approaching
group. Virginia's delicate face, shy
and eager under drooping feathers, and the
tall, slender Alvar, wearing his now scrupulously
English morning suit with a grace
that gave it a picturesque appropriateness,
were in front. Ruth and Rupert lingered
a little, and Nettie came running up from
behind, with Rolla after her, and Dick
Seyton lazily calling on her to stop. Mr.
Lester looked at his son, and a new idea
struck him.

I wish Alvar to make acquaintances'*
he said. '* Nothing but English society
can accustom him to his new life."

Here Alvar saw them, and raised his hat
as he came up.

Have you had a pleasant walk,
Alvar?" said his father, less stiffly than
usual.

'' It has been altogether pleasant, sir,"

said Alvar, " since Miss Seyton has been
mj companion."

Virginia blushed, and went up to lier
uncle with a hasty question about the
puppies that Nettie was to see, and no one
exchanged a remark on the subject; but
that night as they were smoking, Rupert
rallied Alvar a little on the impression he
was making.

Alvar did not misunderstand him ; he
looked at him straight.

I had thought," he said, " that it was
here the custom to talk with freedom to
young ladies. 1 see it is your practice, my
cousin."

Yes, yes. Besides, I'm an old friend,
you see. Of course it is the custom ; but
consequences sometimes result from it 
pity if they didn't."

But it may be," said Alvar, " that as
my father's son, it is expected that I
should marry if it should be agreeable to
my father ?"

'' Possibly," said Rupert, unable to
resist trying experiments. '' Fellows with

expectations have to be careful, you
know."

I thank you," said Alvar. " But I do
not mistake a lady who has been kind tome,
or I should be a coxcomb. Goodnight,
my cousin."

Good night," said Rupert, feeling
somewhat baffled, and a little angry ; for,
after all, he had been perfectly right.

CHAPTER Xiii.

TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION.
Love me and leave me not."

The hill that lay between Oakby and
Eldertliwaite was partly covered by a
thick plantation of larches, through which
passed a narrow foot-path. In the summer,
when the short turf under the trees
was dry and sweet, when the blue sky
peeped through the wide - spreading
branches, and rare green ferns and blue
harebells nestled in the low stone walls,
the larch wood was a favourite resort;
but in the winter, when the moorland
winds were bleak and cold rather than
fresh and free, when the fir-trees moaned
and howled dismally instead of responding

like harps to the breezes, before, in that
northern region, one " rosy pkimelet tufted
the larch," or one lamb was seen out on
the fell side, it was a dreary spot enough.

All the more undisturbed had it been,
and therefore all the more suitable for
the secret meetings of Rupert and Ruth.
Matters had not always run smooth between
them. An unacknowledged tie
needs faith and self-restraint if it is to
sit easily ; and at their very last parting
Rupert expressed enough jealousy at the
remembrance of Cheriton's attentions to
make Ruth furious at the implied doubt of
her faith, forgetting that she was miserable
if he played with Nettie, or talked for ten
minutes to Virginia.

Rupert insisted that " Cherry meant
mischief'* Ruth vehemently asserted
that it wasn't in him to mean ; " and
after something that came perilously near
a quarrel, she broke into a flood of tears,
and they parted with renewed protestations
of inviolable constancy, and amid hopes of
chance meetings in the course of the spring.

Ruth fled away through the copses to
Elderthwaite feeling as if life would be
utterly blank and dark till their next
meeting; and Rupert strolled homeward,
thinking much of Ruth, and not best
pleased to meet his uncle coming back
from one of his farms, and evidently
inclined to be sociable ; for Rupert, as
compared with Alvar, had an agreeable
familiarity.

Mr. Lester, though he had held as little
personal intercourse with Alvar as the circumstances
of the case permitted, had
hardly ceased, since he came home, to
think of his future, and that with a conscientious
effort at justice and kindness.
He still felt a personal distaste to Alvar,
which ruffled his temper, and often made
him less than civil to him ; but none the
less did he wish his eldest son's career to
be creditable and fortunate, nor desire to
see him adapt himself to the pursuits likely
to be required of him. He made a few
attempts to instruct him and interest him
in the county politics, the requirements of

the estate, and the necessities of the parish ;
but Alvar, it must be confessed, was very
provoking. He was always courteous, but
he never exerted his mind to take in anything
that was strange to him, and would
say, with a shrug of his shoulders and a
smile, " Ah, these are the things that I do
not understand; '' or, as he picked up the
current expressions, " It is not in my line
to interest myself for the people," with a
naivete that refused to recognize any duty
one way or the other. In short, he was
quite as impervious as his brothers to anything
"out of his line," and, like Mr.
Lester himself, thought that what he did
not understand was immaterial.

Mr. Lester was in despair ; but when he
saw Alvar and Virginia together, and
noticed their mutual attraction, it occurred
to him that an English wife would be the one
remedy for Alvar' s shortcomings ; and he
also reflected, with some pride in his knowledge
of foreign customs, that Alvar would
probably require parental sanction before
presuming to pay his addresses to any lady.

As for Virginia, tliougli lie was of
Seyton blood, all lier training had been
away from lier family ; her fortune was not
inconsiderable, and she herself, enthusiastic,
refined, and high-minded, was exactly the
type of woman in which Mr. Lester
believed. Besides, since he could not
make Alvar other than the heir of Oakby,
his one wish was that his grandchildren at
least should be English. He was very
reluctant that Alvar should return to Spain,
and at the same time hardly wished him to
be a permanent inmate of Oakby. It had
been arranged that Alvar should pay a
short visit to the Cheritons before Easter,
when he would see what London was like,
go to see Cherry at Oxford, and having
thus enlarged his experiences, would return
to Oakby for Easter and the early part of
the summer.

After Cheriton had taken his degree, he
too would enjoy a taste of the season, and
Alvar might go to town again if he liked ;
while in August Alvar must be introduced
to the grouse, and might also see the fine

scenery of the Scotch and English lakes.
These were plans in wliicli Alvar could
find nothing to complain of ; but they
would be greatly improved in his father's
eyes if they could end in a suitable and
happy marriage ; for he saw that Alvar
could not remain idle at Oakby for long,
and had the firmest conviction that he
would get into mischief, if he set up for
himself in London. His mind, when he
met Rupert, was full of the subject, and
with a view to obtaining a side light or
two if possible, he asked him casually what
he thought of his cousin Alvar, and how
they got on together.

I don't think he is half a bad fellow,"
said Rupert, '' a little stiff* and foreign,
of course, but a very good sort in my
opinion."

This was well meant on Rupert's part,
for he did not personally lice Alvar, but he
had tact enough to see the necessity of
harmony, and family feeling enough to
wish to produce it.

Of course," said Mr. Lester, '' you can
VOL. I. p

understand that I have been anxious about
his coming here among the boys''

I don't think he'll do them any harm,
sir."

No ; and except Cherry, they don't
take to him very warmly ; but I hope we
may see him settle into an Englishman intime.
A good wife now  "

Is a very good tiling, uncle," said
Rupert, with a conscious laugh.

Yes, Rupert, in a year or two's time
you'll be looking out for yourself."

Rupert liked his uncle, as he had always
called him, and, for a moment, was half-inclined
to confide in him ; but he knew
that Mr. Lester's good offices would be so
exceedingly energetic, and would involve
such thorough openness on his own part,
that though his marriage to Ruth might
possibly be expedited by them, he could
not face the reproofs by which they would
be accompanied.

So he laughed, and shook his head,
saying, "Excellent advice for Alvar, sir;
and see, there he comes."

Alvar approached his father with a bow ;
but was about to join Rupert, as he turned
off by another path, when Mr. Lester
detained him.

I should like a word or two with you,"
he said, as they walked on. " I think 
it appears to me that you are beginning
to feel more at home with us than at
first."

Yes, sir, I know better how to suit
myself to you."

I am uncommonly glad of it. But
what I meant to say was  you don't find
yourself so dull as at first?" said Mr.
Lester rather awkwardly.

'' It is a little call," said Alvar, 'but I
can well endure it."

This was not precisely the answer which
Mr. Lester had expected; but after a
pause, he went on, 

'* It would be hard to blame you because
you do not take kindly to interests
and occupations that are so new to you.
I do not feel, Alvar, that I have the same
right to dictate your way of life as I should
p 2

have, if I lead earlier assumed the charge of
you; but I would remind sou that since
one day you must be master here, it will
be for your own happiness to  to accustom
yourself to the life required of you."

My brother ought to be the squire'*
said Alvar.

That is impossible. It is not a matter
of choice ; but it would cause me great
unhappiness if I thought my successor
would either be constantly absent or  or
indifferent to the welfare of the people
about him."

You would wish me," said Alvar, '' to
live in England, and to marry an English
lady."

Why, yes  yes. Not of course that I
would wish to put any restraint on your
inclinations, or even to suggest any line of
conduct; but it had occurred to me that
in short, that you find Elderthwaite
attractive, and I wished to tell you that
such a choice would have my entire approval."


Mr. Lester's florid face coloured with a
sense of embarrassment ; he was never at

his ease with his son, whereas Alvar only
looked considerate, and said thoughtfully, 

'' Miss Seyton is a charming young
lady."

 Very much so, indeed," said the
squire ; '' and a very good girl."

Alvar walked on in silence. Probably
the idea was not strange to him ; but his
father could not trace the workings of his
mind, and a sense of intense impatience
possessed him with this strange creature
whose interests he was bound to consult,
but whose nature he could not fathom.

Suddenly Ivar stopped.

"My father, I have chosen. This is
my country, and Miss Seyton  if she will
shall be my wife."

Well, Alvar, I'm very glad to hear it,"
said his father, '' very glad indeed, and
I'm sure Cheriton will be delighted. Don't,
however, act in a hurry ; I'll leave you to
think it over. I see James Wilson, and
I want to speak to him."

sand Mr. Lester called to one of the
keepers who was coming across the park,
while Alvar went on towards the house.

CHAPTER XIV,

Virginia's choice.

Things that I know not of, belike to thee are dear."

There was the shadow of such a thought
on the blushing face of Virginia Seyton as
she sat in a great chair in the old drawing-room
at Elderthwaite and listened to the
wooing of Alvar Lester. She held a bouquet
on her lap, and he stood, bending forward,
and addressing her in language that was
checked by no embarrassment, and with a
simplicity of purpose which had sought
no disguise. Alvar had reflected on his
father's hints over many a cigarette, he
had thought to himself that he was resolved
to be an Englishman, that Miss Seyton
was charming and attractive beyond all

other ladies, it was well that lie should
marry, and he would be faithful, courteous,
and kind.

Assuredly he was prepared to love her,
she made England pleasant to him, and he
had no strong ties to the turbulent life of
Spain, from which his peculiar circumstances
and his natural indolence had alike
held him aloof. He had no thought of
giving less than was Virginia's due, it was
a simple matter to him enough, and he
had come away that morning, with no
false shame as to his intentions, with a
flower in his coat and flowers in his hand,
and had demanded Miss Seyton's permission
to see her niece, heedless how far
both households might guess at the matter
in hand.

With his dark, manly grace, and tender
accents, he was the picture of a lover, as
she, with her creamy skin rose-tinted, and
her fervent eyes cast down, seemed the
very type of a maiden wooed, and by a
favoured suitor. But if the hearts of this
graceful and well-matched pair beat to the

same tune, the notes for each had very
different force, and the experiences and
the requirements of each had been, and
must be, utterly unlike those of the other.

Alvar recognized this, in its obvious
outer fact, when he began 

I have a great disadvantage," he said,
since I do not know how best to please
an English lady when I pay her my
addresses. Yet I am bold, for I come
to-day to ask you to forget I am a stranger,
and to help me to become truly an Englishman.
Of all ladies, you are to me the
most beautiful, the most beloved. Can
you grant my wish  my prayer ? Can I
have the happiness to please you  Virginia
? "

Virginia's heart beat so fast that she
could not speak, the large eyes flashed up
for a moment into his, then dropped as the
tears dimmed them.

Ah ! do I make you shed tears ? "
cried Alvar. '' How shall I tell you how I
will be your slave ? Mi doria, mi regna !
nay, I must find English words to say

you are the queen of my life! " and he knelt
on one knee beside her, and took her hand.

Perhaps it was all the more enchanting
that it was unlike a modern English girl's
ideal of a likely lover.

"Please don't do that," said Virginia,
controlling her emotion with a great effort.
'' I want to say something, if you would
sit down."

With ready tact Alvar rose at once, and
drew a chair near her.

'' It is my privilege to listen," he said.

It is that I am afraid I must be very
different from the girls whom you have
known. My ways, my thoughts, you
might not like them ; you might wish me
to be different from myself  or I might
not understand you," she added very
timidly.

In asking a lady to be my wife, I think
of no other woman," said Alvar. " In my
eyes you are all that is charming."

This would not have occurred to me,"
said Virginia ; '* but since I came home I
have not been very happy, because it is so

hard to accommodate oneself to people
who think of everything differently from
oneself. If that was so with us  with

your

My thoughts shall be your thoughts,"
said Alvar. '' You shall teach me to be
what you wish  what my brother is. I
know well," and he rose to his feet again
and stood before her, " I am not clever, I
do not know how to do those things the
English admire ; my face, my speech, is
strange. Is that my fault ; is it my fault
that my father has hated and shunned his
son? Miss Seyton, I can but offer you
myself. If I displease you  "

Alvar paused. Virginia had been pleading
against herself, and before his powerful
attraction her misgivings] melted away.
She rose too, and came a step towards
him.

I will trust you," she said ; and Alvar,
more moved than he could himself have
anticipated, poured forth a torrent of
loving words and vows to be, and to do all
she could wish. But he did not know, he

did not understand, what she asked of
him, or what he promised.

*' But we must be our true selves to
each other," she said afterwards, as they
stood together, when he had won her to
tell him that his foreign face and tones
were not displeasing to her  not at all.
Sto, she did not wish that he was more
like his brothers.

*' I will be always your true lover and
your slave," said Alvar, kissing the hand
that she had laid on his. " And now must
I not present myself to your father ? He
will not, I hope, think the foreigner too
presuming."

There is papa," said Virginia, glancing
out of the window ; ''he is walking on the
terrace. Look, you can go out by this
glass door." And leaving Alvar to encounter
this far from formidable interview,
she ran away up to the little oak room in
search of her cousin.

There were tears in Ruth's great velvety
eyes as she turned to meet her, but she
was smiling, too, and even while she held

out lier arms to Virginia, she thought 
'' What, jealous of the smooth course of
her Httle childish love ! I would not give
up one atom of what I feel for all the easy
consent and prosperity in the world."
But none the less was she interested and
sympathetic as she listened to the outpourings
of Virginia's first excitement, and
to the recital of feelings that were like,
and yet unlike, her own.

You see, Ruthie, I could not help
caring about him, he was so gentle and
kind, and he never seemed angry with the
others for misunderstanding him. But
then I thought that our lives had been so
wide apart that he might be quite different
from what he seemed; and one
has always heard, too, that foreigners pay
compliments, and don't mean what they
say."

'' I should have despised you, Queenie, if
you had thrown over the man you love
because he was half a foreigner."

'' Oh, no, not for that. But I didn't I
hadn't begun to  like him very much then,

you see, Ruth. And if he lead not been
good  '

"And low have you satisfied yourself
that he is what you call ' good ' now ? "
said Ruth curiously.

"Of course," replied Virginia, " it is not
as if he had been brought up in England. He
cannot have the same notions. But then he
cannot talk enough of Cherry's goodness,
and seemed so grateful because he was kind
to him. Cherry is a very good, kind sort
of fellow of course ; but don't you think
there is something beautiful in the humility
that makes so much of a little kindness,
and recognizes good qualities so ungrudgingly
? "

Ruth laughed a little. Perhaps she
thought Alvar's " bonny black eyes " had
something to do with the force of these
arguments.

Since you love each other," she said,
that is a proof that you are intended for
each other. What does it matter ' what he
is like,' as you say ? "

"But 'what he is like' made all the

difference in the first instance, I suppose ? "
said Virginia.

Perhaps," said Ruth, with a Httle shrug.
But now you have once chosen, Virginia,
nothing ought to make you change, not if
he were ever so wicked  not if he were a
murderer ! "

Ruth," exclaimed Virginia, " how can
you be so absurd ! A murderer ! "

*' A murderer, a gambler, or a  well, I'm
not quite sure about a thief," said Ruth,
cooling down a little ; and then the girls
both laughed, and Virginia sank into a
dreamy silence. She did not even yet
know the story of her mother's married life,
or she could not have laughed at the thought
of a gambler for her husband ; but she did
know enough of her family history to give
definiteness to the natural desire of a high-principled
girl to find perfection in her lover.
Virginia's nature inclined to hero-worship;
reverence was a necessary part to her of
a happy love. She had thought often to
herself that she would never marry a man of
whose good principles she was not satisfied.

And since Alvar's offer had not entirely
taken her by surprise  his gallantry haying
been tenderer than he knew  she had considered
the point with an effort at impartiality,
and had justified the conclusion
to which her heart pointed by Alvar's
admiration for the brother, whom, in
Virginia's opinion, he idealized considerably.
Of course, if she had chosen wisely, it was
instinct, and not knowledge, that led her
aright. She knew absolutely nothing of
Alvar ; and just as from insufficient grounds
she now gave him credit for many virtues,
it might be that, when the differing natures
jarred, a little failure, a little defectiveness,
might make her judgment cruelly hard, at
whatever cost to her own happiness.

It might come to a struggle between the
girl's ideal and the woman's love  and in
such a struggle compromises and forgiveness
and new knowledge on either side
Avould lead to final comprehension and
peace. But it comes sometimes to a fight
between heart and soul, between the higher
self and the love that seems stronger than

self. To this extremity Alvar Lester was
not likely to drive any woman; but impatience
and inexperience sometimes mistake
the one contest for the other. Virginia
would have something to bear, he
much to learn, before mutual criticism
ceased, as they became indeed part of each
other's existence, before Virginia's flutter
of startled joy subsided into unquestioning
content.

You talk, Ruthie," exclaimed Virginia,
after a little more confidential chatter, '' but
you cannot make up your own mind. You
cannot decide whether you will have poor
Captain Lester."

Hark ! hark ! " cried Ruth, '' they are
calling you ! Every one is not so lucky as
you." And as Virginia obeyed her father's
summons, and she was left alone, she pulled
out the locket that contained Rupert's
portrait, kissed it passionately, and exclaimed,
half-aloud, 

'' Not make up my mind ! Do / doubt
and hesitate ? What do I care ' what you
are like,' my darling ? I love you with all

my heart and soul ! I love yon  I love
you ! What would life be without love? "

The congratulations of Virginia's family
on the occasion were characteristic. Her
father had but a nominal consent to give.
Virginia was of age, and besides, the trustees
of her fortune could not of course take
any exception to such an engagement ; but
he rejoiced exceedingly, as at the first good
and happy thing that had happened in his
family for long enough.

*' And so you have got a husband, though
you are a Seyton ? " said her aunt. '' Well,
Roland's a long way off, and I don't suppose
Dick and Harry can create scandal enough
to put an end to it before next October."

But you'll give me a kiss, auntie ? " said
Virginia ; and in the warmth of her embrace
she tried to show the sympathy for that
long past wrong which she never would have
dared to utter.

Miss Seyton was silent for a moment, and
patted her soft hair; then suddenly, with
an expression indescribably malin and
elfish, she said, 'rand all those poor little

VOL. I. Q

neglected children, whose souls yon were
going to save, what will become of them
when yon are married ? Do yon think your
uncle will teach them himself ? "

And I shouldn't be surprised if he
did, Aunt Julia," interposed Ruth briskly,
now Virginia has shown him the way."

Parson Seyton's remark was somewhat
to the same effect, though made in a more
genial spirit.

'well, my lass, so you've caught the
Frenchman? Why didn't you set your
cap at Cherry ? He's worth a dozen of
him."

Cherry didn't set his cap at me, uncle,"
said Virginia, laughing.

And all the little lads and lasses ? Ha,
ha, I must set about learning the catechism
myself. What's to be done, my
queen ?  what's to be done ? Send away
Monsieur Alvar ; we can't do without you."

Virginia had not forgotten the children ;
but as her marriage was not to take place
till the late autumn, there was no immediate
question of her leaving them.

Mr. Lester thought that it would be
far better that Alvar should see something
of England before his marriage, and Alvar
acquiesced readily in his father's wish;
and he very shortly left Oakby for London,
after receiving congratulations from his
brothers, in which astonishment was the
prevailing ingredient, though Cheriton softened
his surprise with many expressions of
satisfaction.

He was glad that Alvar had chosen an
English wife ; still more glad that he had
no disposition to choose Ruth.

CHAPTER XV.

A BIT OF THE BLARNEY.

With him there rode his sone, a younge squire,
A lover and a lusty bachelor."

In that year Easter fell very late, and it
was nearly the end of April before the
Lesters gathered together once more at
Oakby. Alvar and Virginia had hardly
had time to grow accustomed to their new
relations to each other before the former
went to London, where he perhaps adapted
himself more easily to his surroundings
than he would have done in the presence
of his father and brothers. He found that
all English people did not regard life precisely
from the Oakby point of view ; that
Lady C her i ton greatly regretted that Net-tie
was such a tomboy, and almost feared

that Bob would never be fit for polite
society.

He was introduced to people who thought
this music enchanting and his foreign manners
charming; he was allowed to be on
cousinly terms with the Miss Cheritons,
and was an object of exciting interest to
every young lady who met him. Under
these circumstances he was very well content,
and despatched graceful and tender
letters to Virginia, which often had an
amusing naivete in their details of his impressions
of English life. He also sent
her various offerings, ornaments, sweetmeats,
and flowers, always prettily chosen,
and commended to her notice by some
pleasant bit of tender flattery. His engagement
was of course generally known,
but his soft words and softer looks, though
too universal to be delusive, were doubtless
none the less attractive from the fact that
his foreign breeding offered a constant
cause and excuse for them.

Virginia, on her side, it need hardly
be said, wrote him many letters, full of

thoughts, feelings, and hopes, and sometimes
requests for his opinion on any subject
that interested lier. Alvar's replies
were so charming, so flattering, and so
tender, that she hardly found out that
they were in no sense answers to her
own.

He made a very great point of going to
Oxford, and was full of excitement at the
prospect of meeting '' my brother " again.
Cheriton, however, had lost some time by
his idle Christmas vacation, and was forced
to work very hard to make up for it. He
had always too many interests in life to
make it easy to concentrate all his efforts
in one direction ; but now the ambition and
love of distinction that were a constant
stimulus to the idle Lester nature in himself
and Jack were fairly alight.

Cheriton cared for success in itself ; he
was too sweet-natured to resent failure,
and conscientious enough to know that
his love of triumph might be a snare to
him, but each object in its turn seemed to
him intensely desirable. He could not feel,

and even prevailing fashion made it difficult
for him to affect, indifference. Besides,
he wanted to appear in the light of a young
man likely to succeed in life before Ruth's
relations. So he wrote that he hoped
Alvar would not think it unkind if he
asked him to pay him only a short visit ;
and Alvar was half consoled by hearing the
Judge speak in high terms of his nephew
as a brilliant young man and likely to do
them all credit.

Ah," said Alvar, '' I fear I should have
done my name no credit if I, like my
brother, had gone to Oxford."

You are an eldest son, my dear fellow,
and I don't doubt that you would have
kept up the family traditions," said Judge
Cheriton drily.

So Alvar went for one day to Oxford,
where he showed an overpowering delight
at seeing Cherry again, and a reprehensible
preference for pouring out to him his
various experiences, to inspecting chapels
and halls. He greeted Buffer respectfully,
nd taxed Cheriton with overworking himself.

He looked pale, lie said, and thin 
not as lie did at Oakby.

Cherry only laughed at him, but insisted
emphatically that he should say no word at
home of any such impression, as perhaps
he should stay up and read during the
Easter vacation.

'but what shall I do," said Alvar,
when the boys, who do not like me, come
home, and you are not there ? "

You  why, you will be all day at
Elderthwaite."

I shall never forget my brother who
was kind to me first," said Alvar earnestly.

Alvar finished up his London career by
going to see the Boat Race, where he was
exceedingly particular to appear in Oxford
colours, and felt as if the triumph of the
dark blue was Cherry's own.

Easter week brought unwontedly soft
airs and blue skies to Oakby, and, after all,
Cheriton himself for a few days' holiday.
Every one rejoiced at the sight of him,
though Jack promptly told him that he was
very foolish to waste time by coming, and

when Cherry owned that he wanted a Httle
rest, grudgingly admitted that he might be
wise to take it ; then seized upon him, first
to discuss with him the work he himself
was doing with a view to a scholarship for
which he meant to compete at Midsummer;
then demanded an immediate settlement,
from Cherry's point of view, of several
important and obscure philosophical questions
; and finally confided to him a long
history of Bob's scrapes and deficiencies
during the past term.

He was so low in the school  he got in
with such a bad lot  he ought to leave
school and go to a tutor's. He, Jack, had
told him he was going straight to the bad,
but had done no good. AYould Cherry
give him a good blowing-up ? Then Mr.
Lester, having had a letter from the headmaster,
wanted to consult him on this very
point, as well as to tell him all the story
of Alvar's courtship and his own diplomatic
behaviour. Also to regret that Alvar
would not take the trouble to understand
the details of English law as applied to

local matters ; could not see why Mr.
Lester, as a magistrate, was prevented
from transporting a poacher for life, or
why, as an owner of land, he thought it
necessary to be so particular as to the
character of his tenants. Then an attempt
at peacemaking with and for Bob, which
resulted in little more than a persistent
growl " that Jack was an awful duffer."

Altogether the family did not seem in a
restful state. Mrs. Lester was very indignant
because Mrs. Ellesmere had
observed that ISTettie was growing too tall
a girl to go about so much by herself.
Who was there that did not know Nettie
in all the country-side P " While Bob and
Nettie themselves, who usually hung together
in everything, especially when either
was in trouble, had an inexplicable quarrel,
which made neither of them pleasant company
for their elders.

Then Mr. Lester's affairs came forward
again in the shape of a dispute with one
of his chief farmers about a certain gate
which had been planted in the wrong place,

involving a question of boundaries and
rights of way, and engaging Mr. Lester ina
difference of opinion with a new neighbour,
'' a Radical fellow from Sheffield,"
whom Mr. Lester would neither have
injured nor been intimate with for the
world. Alvar had the misfortune to
observe that " he thought it was not worth
while to be so distressed about the post of
a gate," an indifference even more provoking
than the misplaced ardour of Jack,
who had taken upon himself to examine
the matter, and believing his father mistaken,
thought it necessary to say so, which
might have been passed over as a piece of
youthful folly, if there had not been a
frightful suspicion that Mr. Ellesmere was
of the same opinion.

Cherry had heard enough of the '' post
of a gate" by the time he had read half-a-dozen
letters of polite indignation, and
listened to an hour's explanation from
his father of the grounds of the dispute,
after which he was requested to form an
independent opinion on the subject.

Well, father," lie said, looking askance
at a plan of the scene of action wliicli Mr.
Lester had drawn for this benefit, '' it seems
that the removal of this gate has mixed up
Ashrigg, Oakby, and Elder th wait e to such
a degree that we shan't know who is living
in which. Of course Alvar can see any
boundaries between Oakby and Elder-thwart
just now. How should he ? His
imagination leaps over them at once. But
I dont think it will ' precipitate the downfall
of the landed gentry,' Jack, whichever
way it is settled." And having thus
succeeded in making his father and Alvar
laugh, and Jack remark " that he never
could see the use of making a joke of everything,"
he asked Mr. Lester to come and
show him the fatal spot. Couldn't they
ride over and look at it ?

'' And I have never seen you yet," said
Alvar reproachfully, when Mr. Lester had
acceded to this arrangement.

' But you are going to Elderthwaite ?
I will come and meet you there. And,
look here, the weather is so fine I am sure

we might all join forces and make an
excursion somewhere. Wouldn't that be
blissful?"

"Ah, you make sport of me!" said
Alvar ; but he promised to propose the
plan at Elderthwaite.

So Cheriton and his father rode through
the bright spring lanes together, like
Chaucer's knight and squire, with the
larks singing in the furrows, and the blue
sky overhead, the sunshine full of promise
and joy, even in the wild, bleak country,
whose time of perfection never came till
the purple heather clothed the bare moorlands
and the summer months had had
time to chase away all thought of the long,
dreary winter. Every breath of the air of
the hill-side was like new life to Cherry.

"It is so delightful to be at home," he
said; "it's impossible to be very angry
about ' the post of a gate.' "

Perhaps this happy humour contributed
no small share towards the harmonious
ending, of the scene which Cherry described
quaintly enough when he presented

himself at Elderthwaite in the afternoon.
How on arriving* at the scene of action
the had found Farmer Fleming and the
fellow from Sheffield both eno-aged in discussing
the point; how Mr. Wilson had
expressed his readiness to put up two gates
if that would settle the matter, but he
could not be dictated to on his own land ;
how Mr. Fleming's view of the matter
seemed to consist in a constant statement
of the fact that he had been the squire's
tenant all his life, and his father before
him ; how the squire had remarked that
Mr. Fleming's father, he was sure, would
have known well that those four feet of
land were common land, and half in Oakland
half in Ashrigg parish, Elderthwaite
bordering them on the south, and that he,
as Lord of the Manor, could not allow
them to be enclosed; Mr. Wilson had
purchased certain manorial rights in
Ashrigg parish; they certainly extended
over the two feet on his own side of
the lane.

Then Cherry had remembered Mr.

Wilson's son at Oxford, and knew that
last year he had taken a first. He had met
him at breakfast ; was he coming down
soon ? This had created a diversion ; and
while the squire and his tenant were at it
hammer and tongs, Cherry had received
several invitations, had warmly applauded
Mr. Wilson's remark that he did not wish
to be unpleasant to old inhabitants on first
coming into the county, and the squire,
having got his own way with the farmer,
an amicable arrangement was arrived at;
while Cherry went to see Mrs. Fleming's
dairy, " because he remembered how she
used to give him such beautiful new milk."

Oh, Cherry, you have more than a bit
of the blarney," said Ruth. '' Haven't you
a drop of Irish blood somewhere ? "

No more than Jack," said Cherry, who
was perhaps a little pleased at his diplomacy.
" I like to smooth things down,
unless, to be sure, one is angry oneself."

'you are always the peacemaker," said
Alvar.

Ah, not always, I am afraid ! But now

I want all the blarney I can muster to persuade
you that it is warm enough to go and
spend the day at Black Tarn. We might
go by train from Hazelbyby to Blacking;
have lunch at the inn there, and go up to
Black Tarn by the Otter's Glen. I asked
Mr. and Mrs. Ellesmere, and they will come
with us"  to Virginia  " I assure you Alvar
agrees."

'' You are wasting your blarney," said
Virginia smiling, 'for we had agreed to
go before you came. It will be very cold
up at Black Tarn, but that will not signify
if we take plenty of wraps."

Such a genuine piece of natural and innocent
amusement was quite a novelty at
Elderthwaite, and the boys were delighted.
The party agreed to meet at Hazelbyby
station, and go by train some ten or twelve
miles towards the mountains on the outskirts
of which Black Tarn lay. There
was a train in the evening by which they
could return, and no one left at home was
to be anxious about them until they saw
them coming back.

CHAPTER Xii.

THE otter's glen.

*' An empty sky, a world of heather,
Purple of foxglove, yellow of broom,
We two among them, wading together,
Stepping out honey, treading perfume."

TiiERK was hardly a lonelier spot in all the
country round than the little Black Tarn.
The hill in which it lay possessed neither
the rocky grandeur nor the fertile beauty
of the neighbouring mountains ; it was
covered with grass and bog, not a tree
relieved its desolateness, no grey rocks
pushed their picturesque heads through
the soil and gave variety to its shape.
The approach to the little lake was defended
by great beds of reeds and rushes, its
waters were shallow, and later in the year

VOL. I. E

full of weeds and water-lilies. But there
was a fine view of the leathery backs of
some of the more important mountains, and
the stream that rushed down the Otter's
Glen was broad and clear, and had been the
scene of many an exciting chase in grey
misty mornings.

To-day the sun was bright and strong,
the fresh mountain wind intensely exhilarating,
and the whole party were in the
highest spirits and ready to enjoy every
incident of their excursion. They had had
their lunch, as proposed, at the Httle wayside
inn, where the Lesters were well
known and always welcome, and had then
set off on their three-miles walk to the tarn
in scattered groups, all at their own pace
and with different views of the distances
they meant to effect.

A large division, headed by Mr. Ellesmere,
had started off at a brisk pace,
intending to get to the to]) of the hill and
see half over the country, but stragglers
began to drop behind.

Mrs. Ellesmere thought the tarn would

be enoiigli for herself and lier younger
children ; every one dropped off from Alvar
and Virginia, and left them to their own
devices, while Cherry set himself to persuade
E/uth that the best thing to do was
to follow the stream, step by step, along
its winding course, heedless of the end.

He could hardly believe in his own good
luck as the voices of the others died away
in the distance, and Ruth put her hand into
his to be helped along the slippery steppingstones
planted here and there on the marshy
path-way.

Whatever was missing for Ruth in the
perfection of the day's pleasure, her great
dark eyes were bright and soft, and a little
flush on her brown cheeks gave her an
additional beauty. She wore a small
closely-fitting hat with a red plume in it,
and a tight dark dress ; and thus, with her
hand in his, and her bewitching eyes raised
to his face, her image recurred to him in
after days.

He had been laughing, and talking, and
managing the expedition, but now alone
R 2

with lier lie fell silent, and there was
that in his face as he looked down at her
that frightened Ruth a little.

During these past months he had grown
less *' boyish," and it crossed Ruth's mind
to wonder if he had had any special purpose
in getting her to himself.

' And have you been working very
hard ? " she said, smiling at him.

*' Pretty well," answered Cherry. ' I
shall be glad when it's all over."

'won't they ring all the bells at
Oakby?"

Cherry laughed.

I hope they won't have occasion to toll
them," he said ; " it seems sometimes much
more likely."

Ah ! that is because you get out of
spirits. And after all, who cares except a
lot of stupid old tutors ? "

I don't suppose you  any one, would
care much."

'why," said Ruth dexterously; "who
judges a man by the result of an examination
? that would be very unfair."

Then," said Cherry shyly, " if I come
to grief I shall go to you for  for consolation.
You won't despise me ? "

Oh, Cherry ! I am sure when one
knows life one sees that after all those
tests are rather childish. I should not
think less of you if you made a mistake."

Perhaps it was characteristic of Cheriton
that he felt more than ever resolved to
attain success, and he answered, 

You ought to think less of me if I did
not do my best to avoid mistakes."

Now that is worthy of Jack, of whom
I am becoming quite afraid. I care for my
friends because  well, because I care for
them, and what they do makes no difference."

That," said Cherry, '' is the sort of
backing up that would make a man able
to endure failure till success came. But
still one must wish to bring home the
spoils ! "

There was a dangerous intensity in
Cheriton' s accent, and Ruth laughed gaily.

'' Of course, men are always so ambitious.
Well, I believe in your spoils,

Cherry, but don't work too hard for them.
Don Alvar told Virginia you would knock
yourself up."

Oh, Alvar ! Hard work is a great
puzzle to him. No fear of my working too
hard, I get stupefied too quickly, otherwise
I should not be here now; but I can't
grudge what is so  so delightful. Take
care, that is a very slippery stone. Won't
you give me your hand ? There, that's a
safe one."

Ruth was not a great adept at scrambling
independently, but she knew how to
be helped with wonderful grace and gratitude.
Nor was a solitary ramble with
Cheriton at all an unnatural thing. He
had helped her up in many a difficult place
in their boy-and-girl days, and teased herby
pretending that he would not help her
down; but now she felt that in more
senses than one she was treading on slippery
ground, and guided the conversation
on to the safer topic of Alvar and Virginia.

*' Weren't you very much surprised,"
said Cheriton, '' when that came about ? "

"Well, you know," said Edith, "Virginia
is rather transparent. I couldn't
help guessing that she was interested in
your brother. She is so romantic, too,
and he is such a cavalier."

I suppose you always study commonsense,"
said Cherry, who preferred greatly
to talk about Ruth herself than to discuss
Virginia.

I have my own ideas of romance,"
said Ruth ; " but I think I have out-grown
the notion that every one ought to look like
a hero."

And what is your idea of romance ? "
asked Cherry, gratified by this remark.

Self-devotion," said Ruth briefly, giving
up everything for the one object. " That's
true romance."

Self-sacrifice ? " said Cherry. " That
is too hard work to be romantic about."

Not for any one  anything one loved,"
said Ruth very low, but with flushing
cheeks.

Then," said Cheriton, " there would
be no other self left to sacrifice."

Eutli was startled. Eupert liacl never
so answered lier thoughts, had never given
her quite such a look.

Cherry paused and turned round towards
her with a desperate impulse urging him
to speak, her face shining with enthusiasm
giving him sudden courage.

''Ah ! " exclaimed Ruth, springing across
on to a very unsteady stone, '' you are
getting too serious ! I declare, there's a
white butterfly, the first for the year.
And look  oh, look, Cherry, isn't that bit
of gorse pretty against the sky? It's too
bad to discuss abstract questions at a
picnic on a spring day."

Cheriton stood still for a moment. He
heard the rush of the water, he saw the
shine of the sun, his eyes followed the
butterfly as it fluttered up to the bit of
yellow gorse, he could see Eutli smiling
and graceful, beckoning to him to follow
her; the glamour and dazzle had passed,
and the day was like any other fine day now.

I did not mean to discuss abstract
questions," he said, with a touch of offence.

All ! but you were getting very deep !
Come, don't be cross, Cherry; you look
exactly like Jack at this minute, and you
can't make your eyebrows meet, so don't
try."

*' Poor Jack, you are very hard on him,"
said Cherry, recovering himself. " Will
you have a bit of the gorse for your hat,
if I cut all the prickles off ? "

If you cut all the prickles off, what
will you leave ? " said Ruth.

They had a very charming walk after
this, and were much more merry and talkative
than at first. There was a sense of
being baffled deep down in Cherry's heart,
but if the rest was surface work it was
very enchanting, and they dawdled and
chattered till the time slipped away, and
they saw their party in the distance coming
back from the tarn.

Oh, let us run," said Ruth, " and get
into the road before them."

Come," said Cherry, holding out his
hand, and they ran across the short turf,
the sweet, keen air blowing in their faces.

a sort of excitement urging E/utli, who was
a lazy little thing usually, to this childish
proceeding.

They came running down into the road
just as the whole party came back from
the tarn, crying out on them for their
laziness.

We have been looking for you," said
Virginia, whose hat was daintily wreathed
with stag moss. '' Alvar and I tried to
j&nd you."

Oh, yes, you were miserable without
us of course," said Cherry. "Hallo,
Rupert ! where on earth did you spring
from?"

I came over for a ball at the 
; they have taken Blackrigg Hall,
you know. I must get back by the first
thing tomorrow. I heard of your picnic
from some of the people about, and came
to see if I could fall in with you."

"You are just in time to come back
with us to the inn," said Mr. Ellesmere;
we shall have no more than time to get
a cup of tea and be off for the train."

*' I thought yon would not come,"
whispered Ruth to Rupert as they all
walked back together.

"So it seemed; what were you doing
with Cherry ? " said Rupert sharply.

Ruth looked at him with reproach in
her eyes, but they had no chance then of
obtaining private words. Rupert looked
savage, but directed his efforts to sitting
next her in the omnibus which was to
convey most of the party to the station.

Don't spoil these few minutes," whispered
Ruth imploringly as she looked up
in his displeased face. " Could I let
people guess how I was longing for you ?
I thought you would have been here
sooner."

Cherry is always to the fore," said
Rupert with an amount of ill-temper for
which Ruth could not quite account. She
felt profoundly miserable, so wretched that
she could hardly keep the tears out of her
eyes. She had looked forward for the last
day or two to this poor little meeting as
such a light in the darkness, and now

some one spoke to Rupert and some one
else to herself. There was no chance of
making it up  if they were to part so !
Oh, it was hard ! Virginia could say as
much as she liked to her lover. Then
Ruth saw that Alvar was not in the omnibus,
nor Cheriton either, and hoped that
the latter fact might assuage Rupert's
jealousy. Perhaps he felt ashamed of it,
for as they neared Blackrigg she felt his
hand clasp hers, and he whispered, " Forgive
me."

In the meanwhile Cheriton, having lingered
a moment to make payments and
final arrangements, was left for the '' trap,"
a very nondescript vehicle, which had
brought Bob and Jack from the station. To
his surprise he found that Alvar instead of
one of the younger ones was his companion.

Why, how's this ? " he said.

'' I thought that I would wait for you.
Is it not my turn ? " said Alvar, who sometimes
liked to claim an equality with the
others.

** I'm afraid you'll get wet," said Cherry ;

they've all the plaids, and it is going to
rain. These mountain showers come up
so quickly."

** I do not mind the rain," said Alvar.

Cheriton, however, mindful of Alvar' s
short experience of the cold, driving rain
of the country, made him put a dilapidated
rug that was in the carriage over his
shoulders, and drove on as fast as he
could, through mist and wind, till about
half-way to Blackrigg there was a great
jolt,  off came the wheel of the trap, which
turned over, and they were both thrown
out on to the high bank beside the road.

Cherry felt Alvar' s arm round him
before he had time to get up, and heard
him speaking fast in Spanish, and then,
*' You are not hurt, my brother ? "

'' Oh, no  no. Nor you ? That's all
right ; but we're in a nice fix. No getting
to Blackrigg to-night. Here's the wheel
off."

The bank was soft and muddy ; and they
were quite unhurt, and after a minute,
Cherry hailed a man passing by, and

asked him to take the horse back to the
inn, proposing to Alvar to try to catch the
train at Stonybeach, an intermediate station,
to which he knew a short cut.

Can you make a run for it ? " he said.

Yes  oh, yes, I can run," said Alvar.
This is an adventure."

It was such a run across country as
reminded Cheriton of his days of purchases,
and was probably a new experience
to Alvar, who remarked breathlessly, as
they neared the station, 

"I can run  when it is necessary; but
I do not understand your races for amusement."


Cheriton made no answer, as they entered
the station and found that after all a
neighbouring market had delayed the train,
and that they had still some minutes to
wait.

"That's" too bad,"- said Cherry, as
strength and breath fairly failed him, and
he sat hastily down on a bench, to his
own surprise and annoyance, completely
exhausted.

\

"All! you are too tired!" exclaimed
Alvar, coming to him; and with a kindness
and presence of mind for which few
had given him credit, he made Cherry
rest, and got the porter to fetch some
water for him (the little roadside station
afforded nothing else), till after a few
minutes of dizzy faintness and breathlessness.
Cherry began to revive into a state
of indignation with himself, and gratitude
to his brother, the expression of which
sentiments Alvar silenced.

Hush ! I will not have you talk yet 1
You must rest till the train comes. Lean
back against me. No  you have not made
a confounded fool of yourself, when you
could not help it."

'' I suppose the fall shook me," said
Cherry, presently. " Hark ! there is the
train. Now, Alvar, don't you say a word
of this. I am all right now."

He stood up as the train came creeping
and groaning into the station, and Jack
made signs to them out of the window.
The train was crowded, and the rest of the

party were farther back. Jack exclaimed
at their appearance, and while they were
explaining their adventure, Alvar got some
wine for Cheriton out of a hamper that
had been brought for the luncheon.

Why, Alvar, you are more than half a
doctor," said Cherry, as he took it. " I'm
all right again now''

Jack scanned him a little anxiously.
'' You had no business to be knocked up,"
he said briefly. " You should not have
tried to run when you were so out of condition."


If I am a doctor. Jack," said Alvar,
''I will. not have my patient scolded. He
is better now, are you not, Cherito mio ?
And we are not fit to see the ladies. See,
I am covered with mud," and Alvar endeavoured
to brush the mud off his hat,
and to make his wet clothes look a little
less disreputable.

Cherry put a great coat on, as a measure
both of prudence and respectability.
He had been desperately desirous of catching
the train for the sake of a few more

words with Ruth ; for on the next day he
was obliged to return to Oxford. They
were all to part at Hazelbyby, where their
respective carriages awaited them.

Ruth had forgotten his very existence
as he hurried up to her in the crowded
station ; for Rupert had been forced to goon
by the train. She remembered now
that her walk with him had made Rupert
angry, and hardly able to control her voice
to speak at all, she wished him a cold,
hasty good-night, and sprang into the carriage
without giving him time for a word.

Cheriton was both angry and miserable ;
he stood back silently, while Alvar put
Virginia into the carriage, and excused
himself gaily for his muddy coat. Dick
Seyton ran up at the last minute, and the
Lesters set out on their six-miles drive in
an open break, under waterproofs and
umbrellas, through the pouring rain. The
twins disputed under their breath, and
Jack lectured Cheriton on the amount of
exercise necessary during a period of hard
reading.

VOL. I. s

Cherry, for once, answered him sharply,
and Alvar, as was usually the case
when his Geschtvistern quarrelled, wondered
silently, both how they could be so uncourteous
to each other, and how they could
excite themselves so much about nothing.
But there had been something in the manner
of his kindness and attention that dwelt
pleasantly in Cheriton's memory of a day
which for many reasons he had afterwards
cause to look back upon with pain.

CHAPTER XVII.

Gifts.
It is the little rift within the lover's lute."

In the June following the expedition to
Black Tarn, some great festivities were
held in honour of the coming of age of a
young nobleman, who possessed a large
property about fifteen miles from Oakby.

His father, the late Lord Milford, had
been a friend of Mr. Lester, and the young
man himself was at school for a time with
his sons. The event being also of importance
in the county, old Mrs. Lester
broke through her usual home-staying
habits, and took Ruth and Virginia Seyton
for a three days' visit to Milford Hall.

It was right for Virginia to be seen in
her own county before her marriage ; it
S 2

was years since her father and aunt had
been present at such a gathering, and
Alvar and his father were of course among
the guests. Cheriton was passing, or had
passed, his examination; but he had decided
not to come home until he knew his fate ;
and in studying the papers every morning,
in the hope of seeing the Class Lists long
before they could possibly be printed, Mr.
Lester and Alvar found at last a subject
on which they could thoroughly sympathize,
though Mr. Lester frequently remarked
that there was never any knowing how
those matters would be managed ; he did
not expect much, while Alvar suffered
from no misgivings at all.

Rupert and some of his brother officers
were among the guests; the entertainments
were of the most brilliant description, and
the weather perfect.

Ruth was well known and popular.
True, she distinguished herself neither in
archery nor any other outdoor sport ; she
was not even a very great dancer ; but she
could talk, and look, and smile as if her

companion's words were the one thing
interesting to her ; hence her success.
And Rupert was there, and in the dark
alleys and lonely shrubberies of the great
gardens at Milford, opportunities for 
were not wanting. Ruth, conscious
of her becoming dress of the soft, warm
maize that suited her brown skin, with
amusement and admiration to froth her
cup of pleasure, and Rupert's exciting presence
to spice it and make it worth the
drinking, might seem to be enjoying the
most brilliant outcome of young-lady life.
Sparkle and colour, feeling and passion,
she would have chosen as her greatest
good. Theoretically she would have willingly
embraced the pains and penalties
which they might bring in their train.
Yet Ruth on the sunny lawns and stately
paths of Milford was profoundly and
violently miserable, full of anger and
despair.

The terms on which she stood with
Rupert were such as could only be endurable
with the most perfect trust on

both sides. Where it was necessary to
feign neglect, it was sometimes a strain
to believe in the real devotion. Neither
Ruth nor Rupert were people whose
manners precluded the possibility of a
mistake, and, as has been seen, Rupert
was not proof against jealousy. The
strength of Ruth's own passion made
her more trustful of his, but at the same
time she demanded more from him, and
he failed to fulfil her ideal of an ardent
lover. He appeared to her to be too
cautious, to miss opportunities, and be his
necessity for secrecy what it might, she
could not bear to see him attentive to
others  to another, rather.

There was a young Lady Alice, in her
first season, a charming childish beauty,
after whom it was the fashion to run, and
who found it agreeable enough to torment
her many admirers, and provoke the aunt
who chaperoned her, by flirting with the
handsome Captain Lester, who, on his side,
knew well enough that she meant nothing
serious ; and, while he was true in his

heart to Ruth, was vain enough to be
flattered by the preference of a beauty, and
of a lady, moreover, of rank and distinction.
It showed every one that he was a
man of the world, and a very agreeable
fellow.

Perhaps matters might have mended if
Mrs. Lester, who thought modern manners
much too free, and drew a sharp distinction
between the simplicity of her own
straightforward, unwatched girlhood and
the coquetries of a ball-room, and who, moreover,
disapproved of Ruth, had not looked
so very sharply after her, that private interviews
were rendered difficult, and Ruth
was growing too angry to seek one.

She had not sat by him at dinner ; they
were separated at the great concert that
had been given on the day of their arrival ;
and on the next, which was one long fete,
ending in a ball, they only caught a few
hasty words with each other ; and it appeared
to her excited fancy that he was forever
at Lady Alice's side. In the evening
she would not dance with him, crowding

her card with names, laughed, talked,
flirted, and was wretched. It was not till
after supper that he pursued her into the
last of a long vista of conservatories, where
a very youthful partner had conducted her
to smell the stephanotis, and claim the
next dance as his own.

The warm, scented air, the distant
music, the soft, dim mingling of lamp and
moonlight, through which strange, rare
flowers gleamed out from their dark
foliage, formed such a background as
E/uth's vivid fancy, fed by many a tale and
poem, had often painted, to scenes that
should satisfy her in their tenderness and
intensity. Among the Tvdld fir-woods of
Oakby, here and there, at odd times and
by unexpected chances, she had known
blissful moments, every one of which was
before her now as she set her mouth hard,
and looked at Rupert with eyes full both
of love and anger.

Rupert was excited and eager, conscious
of having given cause of offence, and a
little off his head with the flattery he had

received. He failed to read the meaning
of her face, and turned to lier eagerly.

'' At last, my child ! Mrs. Lester is a
perfect dragon ! "

I don't think it has been Mrs. Lester's
fault."

'' It has been none of mine," said Rupert.
"" Your fine, yellow dress escaped me at
every turn, and I could not get away from
the people. I have had to work hard for
my fun, and arrange dozens of things."

I daresay it is very pleasant to be so
popular," said Ruth, detecting the little
boast, which in a cooler moment would
have passed unnoticed. There was a sort
of airiness in Rupert's manner, inexpressibly
irritating when she wanted every
assurance of the passion which she was so
often obliged to take upon trust.

*' Come, Ruthie, that's not fair. What
is a poor fellow to do ? I have been
horribly down in the mouth since we
parted ; it takes so long to get one's affairs
to rights. Your guardians would bow me
out of the house pretty quickly if I applied

to them now. Can you trust me a little
longer, my darling ? I'm living on twopence
a day to bring things round."

'* And did the gloves Lady Alice won
from you, come out of the twopence ." said
Ruth, unable to control her anger, sarcastic
because such a storm of tears was pending.

Eupert's quick temper took fire in a
moment.

If you have so little confidence in me,
Ruth, as to be angry at such a trifle," he
said hotly, "it is impossible  You make
me feel that I ask more of you than you
can give."

Yes," said Ruth, '* I cannot give such
confidence. When it is months since I
have seen you  weeks since I heard from
you. I cannot see you devoted to  to
another, when you cannot find a moment
for me. If you can bear it  "

You are very unreasonable, Ruth. I
thought that you were generous before all
other women, and patient. You speak as
if you doubted my honour."

*' If it comes to talking of honour'' cried

Eutli, " if you need tlioi to bind you, you
are free. I will not hold you one hour by
your honour ! "

Nor I you to a trial of generosity,
which it seems you cannot bear."

If Rupert had not been first Ute monte,
and then very angry, he would not have
made this remark.

Generosity ! " cried Ruth. " No. If
honour and generosity are required between
us, I'll make no claim on them. Let it all
be over  we'll part. Yes, we'll part, and
then you need deny yourself nothing 
nothing for my sake."

'' It might be best  if you look on it in
tins way."

There was a silence. Rupert pulled
his moustaches sharply; his face vas
pale ; in that hot moment he felt he
might be well quit of Ruth's unreasonable
jealousy and suspicion. Ruth sat quite
still ; she would have yielded at a word,
perhaps  in a minute more she might even
have made the first advance to a reconciliation.
But as the dance ended the conservators

filled with people. They were
joined by two or three couples, and a young
lady, an old acquaintance of Rupert's, exclaimed,
with sufficient forwardness, 

Oh, Captain Lester, what do you think
we were discussing ? People say that you
are engaged to be married. Is it true  do
tell me ? "

No," said Rupert shortly. " I am not
engaged to be married, nor likely to be."

He laughed bitterly as he spoke, and
perhaps under the circumstances could
hardly have avoided some sort of denial ;
but the directness of this one, and the tone
in which it was spoken, seemed to seal
Ruth's fate. She said afterwards that she
went mad at that moment, and certainly
she lost the soft self-possession that was
one of her chief charms, grew daring
and defiant, and said and did things that
others remembered long after she had
recovered from the wild excitement that
prompted them. The sacredness of ungovernable
feeling was an article of her
faith, and she was quite as miserable as

she ever tlioiight true love would defiant
of any one. But the poor child, as she sat
on the floor in her own room that night,
with her face hidden on a chair, did not
think at all that she was " having an experience,"
nor going through the second
volume of the story, in the beginning of
which she had so gloried; she only felt
that she was utterly and inconceivably
wretched, and angry beyond expression.
Rupert did not care for her, or only cared
in a commonplace fashion. There was
nothing left in life for her. Evidently he
had been glad to find in the quarrel an
excuse for an escape.

Ruth's hot displeasure culminated when
she came down to breakfast the next
morning, and found that every one was
regretting the departure of the officers
from York, who had been obliged to take
leave early that morning. They would bea
great loss at the tenants' ball that night.

Father, my father," suddenly exclaimed
Alvar Lester, coming into the room with a
newspaper in his hand. '' See, it is here,

Gerald Oheriton Lester.' And he is first.
I said so. Ah ! I rejoice ! "

Alvar's eager voice and excited face
attracted general attention, as he put the
paper into his father's hand, and pointed
over his shoulder. There was a chorus
of congratulation, while Mr. Lester's blue
eyes looked as bright as his son's black
ones, as he hummed and hard, coughed
two or three times, and said, with as little
exultation as he could manage to show,
' That he was glad Cheriton had worked
hard and done'his best. He was a good lad,
and had never given any trouble. Now,
they could have him at home for a bit."

''Ah! that will be jolly'' said Alvar.
But he will have come home, through last
night, and we shall not be there."

'' Send a telegram to meet him, and ask
him to come over," said young Lord Milford.
'* He always was a capital fellow, and
I shall be delighted to see him."

'' And I hope, Milford," said the young
lord's mother, " that you will take example
by your friend."

Don't you bnilcl on any such hopes,
mother, but I'll go and see about getting
him over here at once."

Mrs. Lester was moved to encomiums
on Cherry's studies and steadiness ; and
more than one of those present remarked
with admiration the unselfish pleasure taken
by the elder brother in the success of his
universally popular junior.

Virginia Seyton watched her betrothed a
little wistfully. Ruth's was not the only
love story that was running its course
through these early summer months, and
Virginia's heart was not quite at ease. If
'' what Rupert was like," had come upon
Huth with a sudden blow, " what Alvar was
like," was still something of a problem to
Virginia. He was attractive to her beyond
measure, he occupied every corner of her
heart; it was joy to her to be near him;
his gentle, chivalrous courtship gave her
unimaginable delight. She could remember
every glance of his eyes, every touch of his
hand ; but  But what ? Alvar was at
once too obtuse and too proud ever to

assume a character that did not sidelong to
him. He did not think it worth while to
acquire or profess new sentiments ; perhaps
he never even perceived that the were
desired. He was, spite of his courteous
tongue, as absolutely candid a person as his
brother Jack. He was not a bit worse
than he seemed, neither was he much
better. He behaved very well in his
difficult life, and regulated his conduct by
certain maxims of honour and courtesy;
but, in the sense in which Virginia understood
the word, he had no principles at all.
It was with a curious mixture of sensations
that, when, a propos of some scrape of
Dick's, she had timidly alluded to the
gambling that had brought such distress
on her family, Virginia heard him answer, 

'' Ah, they have had much ill-fortune,"
without a spark apparently of righteous
indignation.

Nor could she help perceiving that he
scarcely ever occupied himself with anything
more useful than a cigar. '* My father
is always busy," he would say complacently,

as he sat idle ; but lie did not point any
popular moral ; for idleness made him
neither ill-humoured nor mischievous.

Virginia loved him well enough to set all
her will on the side of making allowances.
When he saw her scrupulous and earnest in
fulfilling her religious duties, he would kiss
her hand and say, ** My queen is as holy asa
saint," and he conformed sufficiently to the
Oakby standard to satisfy her conscience,
if not his own, never uttering a word that
could offend her. But, as he had told
Cheriton, ''he did not interest himself in
these matters," and she knew it.

Perhaps Virginia, diffident as to her
knowledge of masculine standards and
modes of expression, might never have
realized even thus much to herself, but for
the instinctive sense of another shortcoming
in her lover, which she would not
admit, and which she hated herself for even
imagining. It came, by a strange turn of
fate, both to her and to Ruth, to feel that
the love they gave was not returned in its
fulness. With what a passion of despair

VOL. I. T

and jealousy Ruth had resented the discovery
has been seen.

To Virginia it brought a disheartening
sense of her own demerit, a doubt of the
truth of her own impressions, vexation at
her own want of trustfulness, shame and
self-blame, because she could not help
knowing that Alvar missed sometimes the
chance of a word or an interview when she
would have secured it, because she felt that
he did not care as she cared. But then,
temperaments differ; some people were
reserved; perhaps she was exacting, and
her cheek had blushed and her eyes sparkled
with joy when Alvar praised the dresses
she had taken such pains to choose for
the Milford fetes, and when he paid her
all the attention due from an affianced
lover.

She had no cause to feel neglected, while
Ruth was chafing at the sight of Rupert's
flirtations. And when the news came of
Cheriton's success, was she not proud of
Alvar's generous delight? Yes, but she
had never stirred his passive content to

such pleasure ; lie had never been in such
high spirits for her ! Ah ! how hatefully
selfish she was to think of it !

The two girls exchanged no confidences.
Ruth's heart was too sore, and Virginia's
too loyal for a word; but as they consulted
over their dresses, and speculated whether
Cheriton would arrive in time for the
tenants' dance that night, each wondered
what the other would say to the secret
thoughts of her heart.

CHAPTER XVIII

RED SUNRISE.

happy world !" thought Pellets, 'all me seems
Are happy  I the happiest of them all."

On that same lot summer night, when
Eutli and Rupert were first making each
other miserable, and then finding out
separately that they were very miserable
themselves, Cheriton, with hope and joy in
his heart, was speeding home to Oakby.
With hope and joy, for Ruth had made up
for her cold farewell, by making some little
excuse for writing to him, and asking him
to get her a picture of the Arms of the
Colleges, a commission which, it is needless
to say, he found time to execute.

This pleasure had helped him through
his hard work, for he was excitable enough

to have felt the last few weeks of effort
and suspense a severe strain, and had not
brought quite his usual health and strength
to bear on them ; for he had caught a bad
cold with the race in the rain at Black
Tarn, and had never given himself a
chance of getting rid of it. However, it
was all over now, he thought, his mind
was relieved, and the prospect of home
with its leisure and its occupations had
never seemed so delightful to him. For
his love for Ruth did not shut out the
thought of all other affections, it rather
cast a radiance over them, and made him
more conscious of their sweetness.

It was a lovely summer morning, as the
train came in to Ashrigg station, the wide
landscape showed clear and fresh against
the cloudless skj, the peculiar northern
sharpness was in the air. It was sweet to
Cherry's senses, and finding no conveyance
so early at Ashrigg, he set off to walk
home across the dewy fields. Buffer,
enchanted at his release from durance vile,
trotting and barking at his heels.

By various short cuts the walk was
under three miles, and Clieriton soon found
himself at the house, where he had time to
get some breakfast, and to feel somewhat
disappointed that no one was at home to
hear his good news, for he felt too tired to
go and seek for congratulations at the
Vicarage, where Nettie was staying, or
where he would have been at least equally
certain of them, to the Lodge to which the
old family nurse had migrated.

So he contented himself with greeting
all the dogs, and with the delightful consciousness
that he had no need to exert
himself, till Lord Milford's telegram arrived,
and the thought of so quickly
greeting Ruth, and of finding her belonging
as it were to his own party, and thus
making a thousand opportunities for paying
her attention, roused him from his fit
of languor and fatigue, and he eagerly
made his preparations, and started off in
the middle of the bright June day, on his
further travels.

The midsummer weather in that northern

country had still miicli of the freshness
and the delicacy of the spring. The trees
were in their first bright green, the bluebells
lingered in the woods, the birds sang
songs of hopefulness to him. Milford was
in a softer, more richly-wooded landscape
than Oakby, and the gardens were splendid
with early roses and flowering shrubs, the
park still here and there white with hawthorn.


This was the children's day, a great
school feast for all the parishes round, to
be followed by a children's dance in the
evening. Cheriton arrived in the midst of
a grand tea in the park, and pausing to
detect his relations, perceived Alvar looking
even unusually tall, stately, and graceful,
as he walked along a row of the very
tiniest children, and' filled their mugs with
milk and water from a huge can. He
looked up as he came to the end, and saw
Cheriton' s laughing eyes fixed full upon him.

*' Ah ! Cheriton ! " he exclaimed, *' you
are here, and with all your honours !
Welcome."

Thanks ; I knew you would be pleased.
So you are making yourself useful. Where's
my father? "

In the tent with Lady Milford. I will
show you."

Cheriton was inclined to think it a great
bore to find his own people surrounded by
strangers, and was ashamed of the congratulations
which the circumstances of his
arrival and the warm-heartiness of his
hosts called forth. So he and his father
hardly said a word to each other, though
they experienced a great content in being
together ; perhaps a more uncommon ending
to a university career than Cherry's
honours, even had they been doubled.

Come, Lester," said Lord Milford,
and make yourself useful. I know you
are great at sack-races, and three-legged
races, and such diversions."

'' After being up all night ? Well, as
long as I am not expected to jump in a
sack myself  " said Cheriton. " Come,
Alvar, don't you want another can of milk
and water?"

'' All ! you laugh at me," said Alvar
contentedly. " I am too glad to see you
to care. This fete is very pleasant. I am
glad you came back in time for it."

Yes ; but I wish we were all at home,"
said Cheriton absently, and looking anxiously
round him. He soon discovered
Virginia, much in her element among a
crowd of school-girls ; and at length his
eyes found the object of their search. A
little apart on a bench sat Ruth in the
most delicate of white muslins, gloves, fan,
and ribbons, all in first-rate order, looking,
with the fantastic fashion, and brilliant
dashes of colour in her dress, like a figure
on a fan. She gave a little start as she saw
Cheriton' s figure in the distance, and her
flush of disappointment as he came nearer
was at once noted by him, and  misinterpreted.


"So you have got your laurels ? " she
said softly, as she held out her hand, and
looked up in his face. " I am glad."

Then they are worth having ? " said
Cheriton.

It might have been a mere jesting
answer, but Eutli did not so take it, nor
did he intend that she should do so. He
would have altered nothing in her greeting
to him, it was a better meeting than he
could have imagined. Afterwards, if Ruth
had wished to discourage him, she would
not have found it easy ; he had but one
purpose, and he set himself to fulfil it ;
hopeful through the charm of present bliss.
It was not often that Cheriton's native
skies were so cloudless, nor were these hot,
full summer days at all typical of the home
that he loved so well. But it was in such
blue unclouded weather," in such smiling
midsummer beauty, that he pictured afterwards
the wind-swept moors and hardy
fir-woods of his north-country home. Nor
did the memory of hot, glaring sunshine,
of dust, and noise, and fatigue, cease to
haunt Ruth for many a day to come.

She was one of those to whom excitement
gives another and an intense self.
Of til is she was dimly conscious, and when
she had said that she could die for Rupert,

she had perhaps not been far wrong. That
extreme anger would urge her to a course
almost equally desperate she had never
guessed, but to give Rupert pain, to cause
him chagrin and remorse, in short, to make
him jealous and miserable as he had made
her, she would have endured tortures.

When people are thus minded, in other
words, when they are in a passion, life
always helps them on. Whether by accident
or by malice, she had heard plenty of
gossip about Rupert ; he had written no
word of repentance ; she knew that Lady
Alice would shortly meet him again. Well,
if lier conduct was discussed between them,
he should hear enough, both to hurt his
provoking self-love, and to show thatch e
did not suffer. And Cheriton offered the
sort of strange counter-attraction often felt
on such occasions to any one else than the
object of anger.

She had always liked to " talk to Cherry,"
his love was flattering, and she instinctively
knew that it was true. He was also a
singularly attractive and lovable person,

and in Ruth's sore-hearted rage she felt his
charm. " It was nice to be with him  he
did her good;" and if she could wound
Rupert and please herself, the possible disappointment
to Cheriton was not worth
considering. But Ruth reckoned without
her host. She neither allowed for Cheriton' s
ardour, nor for the effect that it would
have on her ; she did not know how definite
her choice must be.

Cherry was not nearly so useful as his
friend had expected ; he was too tired to
play games, and dancing, he said, gave him
a pain in his side and made him cough,
which was true, and would have been an
equally good reason against wandering
about in the shrubberies and distant paths
with Ruth, where he incurred other dangers
than night air and dewy grass. He
was too happy to heed any of them. She
listened, as Ruth knew how to listen, to
his account of his Oxford life  his hopes
and fears  his future prospects  and she
was carried away, spite of herself, by the
single-minded earnestness with which he

spoke. He interested her, and lie forgot
herself for the moment as they strolled
along ; the yellow sunset dying in the
distance, the first star shining over the
great house behind them. Suddenly
Cheriton turned and took her hand.

Ruth," he said, *' I have told you all
this because it is so sweet to see you listen.
I have something more to tell you now. I
have a great many aims and ambitions 
there's one dearer than the rest. I love
my own people  my home  very much. I
love you best, infinitely best. I always
have loved you. Can you love me ? "

Oh, Cherry ! " cried Ruth, in desperate
self-defence, " don't say so ! That sort
of love is all a mistake. Keep to the
other sort  it is a great deal better for
you."

Better ! " exclaimed Cheriton. " One
thing is best for me  to have you for my
wife. Oh, Ruth, my darling ! ever since I
was a boy I have loved you. Can't you
care a little for me ? I think you can  I
hope you can. You have always listened

to me and understood me. I think you
know me better than any one does ! "

'' I know  you do care," said Ruth, half
to herself.

It is my very life," he said, and as she,
trembling, hardly able to stand, made a
half movement towards  not away from
him  he threw his arms round her and
drew her close. " My darling !  oh, my
darling 1 am I so happy ?  ah ! thank Grod !
Thank God ! "

Ruth burst into a passion of tears.
Retreat was growing impossible ; she
hardly knew what she wished; anger, a
sort of wild triumph, the difficulty of
resisting this passionate pleading, the inconceivable
joy of Cheriton's face and
voice, added to the overstrained excitement
of her previous feelings, completely
overpowered her, till her sobs were uncontrollable,
and with them came the
strangest impulse to tell him all, the most
incongruous confidence in the justice and
sympathy of this passionate lover for
the love and sorrows that would have

wrecked his hopes. Ah ! if she had but
done so !

Oh, what a fool I have been ! " cried
Cheriton, exceedingly distressed. " Oh,
Ruth, my darling ! I have frightened
you. I'll be patient ; I'll not say another
word. See, here's a seat  sit down. I
deserve that you should never speak tome
again."

Ruth let him lead her to the bench, and
endeavoured to collect her senses.

I am not half good enough for you.
You don't know what you want," she
faltered.

Oh, yes, I do. I know just what I
want," said Cheriton softly and gently ;
but venturing to sit down beside her, and
trying to reassure her by a little playfulness
; " but I don't know how to ask for
it. Alvar might have shown me the
way."

Oh, you know well enough," said Ruth,
in a more natural tone, and in the few
moments, while he sat watching her, her
excitement cooled down, or rather hardened

itself into shape. Her tears dried up, and
she said, 

What would your father say ? "

He will think me too happy ! Will
you forgive me for startling you, and give
me my answer now ? "

He was half smiling, as he timidly put
out his hand again. She had given reason
enough to hope for the answer he wanted,
and suddenly there darted into her mind
as an excuse, a reason, an explanation of
all this conflict of impulses, of the wish
to pique Rupert to avenge herself on the
one side  to snatch something from life
if she could not have all on the other 
a thought  " When Rupert knows he has
such a rival, if. he loves me, he will not
give me np." She yielded her hand to
Cheriton's, and said quickly, 

Only promise me one thing. I did
not think of this  it is so sudden. I am
going away tomorrow, to Mrs. Grey's, fora
fortnight. Promise not to tell any one 
your father, your brothers, till I come back.
Give me time to  to get used to it first."

'' Of course," said Clieriton reluctantly,
that must be as you please. But I
long to tell them of my great happiness.
And my father will care so much about it.
But of course I promise. But I may write
to you ? "

No  no  then every one will find it
out ! " said Ruth, with recurring agitation.
You  you don't know how I feel about
it."

"" Well, T have gained too much to complain,"
said Clieriton, too loyal-hearted,
and too inexperienced, for a single doubt.
*' But Ruth, my Ruth, one thing  give me
one kiss to remember ! "

*' Go then  go ! some one will find us ! "
cried Ruth, and startled by approaching
footsteps, she rushed away from him ; but
the treacherous kiss was given, though she
felt in a moment that she would almost
have died to recall it. She had revenged
herself ; she hated herself ; she already
began to try to excuse herself.

A little later, while troops of gaily-dressed
children were dancing in the

VOL. I. u

lighted hall, and the outdoor guests were
rapidly departing, Alvar was standing on
the terrace, wondering what could have
become of his brother. More than one
person had remarked that he looked delicate
and overworked; and Alvar felt
anxious as he saw him come slowly up
from the grounds towards him.

Where have you been. Cherry ? " he
said. '' Are you not well ? "

Cheriton smiled rather dreamily.

Oh, yes, quite well," he said. There
was a far-away look of blissful, peaceful
content in his eyes, as if it were indeed
well with him; an expression of perfect,
thankful happiness, as far removed from
the ordinary state of this tolerably comfortable
work-a-day world as one of great
wretchedness and misery ; and as remarkable.
As Alvar looked at him, they heard
the cry of a little child. Cheriton turned
and saw trotting along the terrace in the
dusk a very little boy, left behind by some
of the schools now trooping out of the
park. Cherry lifted him up in his arms

and smiled kindly at him, trying to make
out whom he belonged to, and the child
clung to him, quite at ease with him.
'milford School; ah! I see their flag.
Come, my lad, we'll go and find them.
There, don't cry, nobody must cry tonight,
of all nights in the year."

'' When Lady Milford has been so kind,"
said Alvar, for the child's benefit.

'' Ah ! every one is kind ! " said Cherry,
with a little laugh, as he carried away the
child, '' and we must  say thank you."

CHAPTER XIX.

LIFE AND DEATH.

As we descended, following hope,
There sat the shadow feared of man."

Perhaps it was well for the permanence
of Cheriton's new-born happiness that lie
had but a very short glimpse of Ruth.
The next morning, the Oakby party
started early, that Mr. Lester might
arrive in time to attend a magistrate's
meeting at Hazelbyby, while Ruth remained
for the later train that was to take her on
her separate visit. She would not give him
a chance of seeing her alone, and one look,
one clasp of the hand, and  " Remember
your promise " was all the satisfaction he
B 2

obtained from her. Yet be could bardlj
collect bis thoughts to answer bis father's
many questions on their journey borne,
and trying to shout through the noise of
the train made bim cough so much that
bis grandmother scolded bim for catching
such a bad cold.

Young men are so foolish," she said;
but she did not look at all uneasy. Her
grandchildren's illnesses were never
serious ; and all the Lesters thought any
amount of discomfort preferable to " having
a fuss made." Cherry hardly knew
himself how ill he was feeling, as they
reached home and the day went on ; but
he was so weary with bad nights and
fatigue that it was a perpetual effort to
remember that all his suspense of every
sort was over, that the examination was
passed, and that Ruth was bis. He lay
on the sofa trying to rest ; but the cough
disturbed him, and by dinner-time he was
obliged to own himself beaten and to goto
bed, saying that a night's rest would
quite set him up again.

Boys have no moderation," said Mr.
Lester, in a tone of annoyance. "It is
well it is all over now. Clieriton might
have taken quite as good a place without
overworking himself in this way."

Alvar, not understanding that peculiarly
English form of anxiety that shows
itself in shortness of temper, thought this
remark very unfeeling. Mrs. Lester suggested
some simple remedy for the cough ;
Cherry promised to try it, and was left
to his "night's rest."

He woke in the early morning from a
short, feverish sleep, to such pain and
breathlessness and such a sense of serious
illness as he had never experienced in his
life, and, thoroughly frightened and bewildered,
was trying to think how he
could call any one, when his door was
softly opened, and Alvar came in. -

'* I heard you cough so much," he
said. " You cannot sleep. I am afraid
you are ill."

Very ill," said Cherry. '' You must
send some one for the doctor."

He was but just able to tell Alvar
where to find the young groom who could
ride into Hazelbyby to fetch him ; and soon
there was terrible alarm through all
the prosperous household, as, roused one
after another, they came to see what was
amiss. Nettie fled, with her hands up to
her ears, right out into the dewy garden,
away from the house, afraid to hear what
the doctor said of Cherry. Mr. Lester
gave vent to one outburst of rage with
examiners, examination, and Oxford generally,
then braced himself to wait in
silence for tidings ; as he had waited once
before when his wife lay in mortal danger
would the verdict be the same now ?
Mrs. Lester preserved her self-possession,
sent for the keeper's wife, who was the
best nurse at hand, and though sadly at
a loss what remedies to suggest, sat
down to watch her grandson, because it
was her place to do so.

They were all too thankful for any help
in the crisis to wonder that it was Alvar
who held Cherry in an easier position,
and soothed him with quiet tenderness.

When the doctor at length arrived, lie
pronounced that Cheriton was suffering
from a violent attack of inflammation of
the lungs. He was very ill ; but his youth
and previous good health were in his
favour. Overwork and the neglected cold
would doubtless account for it.

Will it be over  in a fortnight ? " said
Cherry, suddenly.

We'll hope so  we'll hope so," said the
doctor. " You have only to do as you are
told, you know. Now, have you a good
nurse? " turning to Mrs. Lester.

Yes, we think Mrs. Thornton very
trustworthy  she was nursery-maid here
before she married."

There must be as few people about
him as possible. No talking and no excitement."


"But  Alvar will stay ? " said Cherry,
wistfully. '' Father, he came in the night
I want him."

Hush, hush, my boy  yes, of course
he will stay with you if you like," said
Mr. Lester, hastily.

*' Of course," said Alvar, with a curious

accent, half proud, half tender, as he laid
his hand on Cheriton's.

The foreign brother was the last person
whom Mr. Adamson expected to see in
such a capacity ; but if he was inefficient,
both he and his patient would probably
soon discover it ; he looked the most self-possessed
of the party, and his manner
soothed Cheriton. Mrs. Thornton had
plenty of practical experience to supply
his inevitable ignorance. Cheriton was
exceedingly ill ; his strength did not hold
out against the remedies as well as had
been hoped, and he suffered so much as
to be hardly ever clearly conscious.

I was so happy ! " he said several
times with a sort of wonder, and his father
felt that the words gave him another
pang.

Mr. Lester was threatened with the most
terrible sorrow that could befall him, and
no mitigation of the agony was possible
to him. He thought that his best-loved
son would die, and made up his mind to
the worst, feeling hope impossible ; but he

made a conscientious effort at endurance,
an effort sadly unsuccessful.

Ell ! mj son," said this old mother,
he is a good lad, take that comfort."

And this reserved hint at the one real
consolation was almost the only attempt
at comforting each other that any of
them made. No one tried to " make the
bet of it," to look at the hopeful side, or
to find in any mutual tenderness a little
lightening of the burden. They held
apart from each other with a curious shyness,
and as far as possible pursued their
several businesses. Nettie went to her
lessons, and refused to hear a word of
sympathy from her friends, and when at
last she could endure the agony no longer,
ran away by herself into the woods and
hid herself all day. Why should they kiss
her and give her flowers  it did not cure
Cherry, or make it less dreadful that
another doctor was coming from Edinburgh,
because Mr. Adamson thought him
so ill. But she did not want to see him,
and had no instinct whatever to do anything

for him. Speech was no relief to
any of them ; it was easier to conceal than
to indulge their feelings ; and Mr. Lester
went about silent and stern ; Nettie attempted
to comfort no one but the dogs ;
and her grandmother found no relief butin
talking of Cherry's " folly in overworking
himself" to Virginia, who came
hurriedly at the first report that reached
Eld earth wait e. She was a rare visitor ; it
was characteristic of her relations with
Alvar that a sort of shyness kept her
away. She forgot to be shy, however,
when Alvar came to speak to her for a
moment, and sprang towards him.

' Oh ! dear Alvar, this is terrible. I
am so sorry for you. But you think he
will be better."

Yes, surely," said Alvar, as if no other
view had occurred to him. " Mi dona,
this is wrong that I should let yon seek
me ; but I cannot leave him  he suffers so
much  that cough is frightful."

"But he likes to have you with him ? '

Yes, I can lift him best, and I do not

ask him how he is when he cannot speak,"
said Alvar, with the simplicity that was so
like sarcasm. " Ah ! it is not right tolet
you go back alone, mi Beijna  but I
dare not stay."

"That does not matter; only take care
of yourself," said Virginia, as Alvar kissed
her hand and opened the door for her, and
promised to let her have news every day.

But she went away tearful for more than
Cheriton's danger. Alvar had never told
her that it comforted him to see her ; he
did not care whether she came or not.

Eh ! my lass, what news have you ? "
said an anxious voice, and looking up,
Virginia saw her uncle, looking unusually
clerical for a week day, hanging about the
path in front of her.

Alvar thinks he will be better, he is
very ill now," said Virginia; "they have
sent for another doctor."

Ah ! that's bad ! There's never been
such another in all the country. Queenie,
did I ever tell you how he kept up our
credit with the bishop ? "

And Parson Seyton, whose nature was
very different from his neighbour's, spent
a long hour in teUiug tales of Cherry's
boyhood to his willing listener. " Eh ! "
he concluded, '' and I meant to fetch him
over to hear our fine singing, and see how
spick and span we are now-a-days  new
surplice and all ! Eh ! he wrote me a sermon
once  when he was a little lad not
twelve years old  and I'll swear it might
have been preached with the best."

Although Virginia had said nothing and
done little to mend matters at Elderthwaite,
there had been a certain revival of the
elements of respectability. A drunken old
farmer had been succeeded by his son, who
had been brought up and had married
elsewhere. This young couple came to
church, and Virginia had by chance made
acquaintance with the bride. Her husband
got himself made churchwarden  Elder-thwart
was not enlightened enough for
parochial contests, and Virginia having
shyly intimated that want of means need
not stand in the way, the windows were

mended, and some yards of cocoa-nut matting
appeared in the aisle. There had
always been a little forlorn singing ; young
Mr. and Mrs. Clement were musical, and
the Sunday children were collected in the
week and taught to sing. The parson had
been presented with the surplice, and as by
this time he would have done most things
to please his pretty niece, accepted it with
some pride. Whether from the effect of
these splendours, or from consideration for
the fair attentive face that he never failed
to see before him, the parson himself began
to conduct the service with a slight regard
to decency and order ; and being with his
Seyton sense of humour fully conscious of
the improvement, and, with the simplicity
that was like a grain of salt in his character,
rather proud of it, had looked forward
to Cherry's approbation.

Eh ! " he said, " I'd like to see him
I'd like to see him."

" He mustn't see any one," said Virginia
; " they will hardly let his father go
in."

Well, it's a pity it's not the Frenchman.
Eh! bless my soul, my darling, I
forgot."

Alvar is almost ready to think so too,
uncle," said Virginia, hardly able to help
laughing.

*' If I could do anything that he would
like  catch him some trout  " suggested
the parson.

"Uncle," said Virginia timidly, "in
church, when any one is sick or in trouble,
they pray for them. They will mention
Cherry's name at Oakby tomorrow. Could
not we  "

Ay, my lass, it would show a very proper
respect," said the parson ; " and the
lad would like it too."

And of all the many hearty prayers that
were sent up on that Sunday for Cheriton
Lester's recovery, none were more sincere
than rough Parson Seyton's.

The Edinburgh doctor could only tell
them what they knew before, that though
there was very great danger, the case was
not hopeless. A few days must decide it.

In the meantime lie must not talk  he must
not see any one who would cause the
slightest agitation; and poor Mr. Lester,
whose self-control had suddenly broken
down before the interview, was about to
be peremptorily banished ; but Cherry put
out his hand and caught his father's, looking
up in his face.

*' Send for the boys," he said.

Yes, but you know you mustn't see
them, my boy  my dear boy."

But Cherry will like to know they are
here," said Altar, in the steady voice that
always seemed like a support.

They shall come. What else what is
it. Cherry ? " said Mr. Lester, as his son
still gazed at him wistfully.

Nothing  not ye," whispered Cheriton.
" Oh ! I want to say so much, father !
I am so glad Alvar came home ! "

The words and the sort of smile with which

they were spoken completely overpowered

Mr. Lester ; but the doctor, who was still

present, would not permit another word.

You destroy his only chance," he

said ; and after that nothing would have
induced Mr. Lester to let Cberiton speak
to him. That evening, however, when he
was alone with Alvar, Cherry's confused
thoughts cleared themselves a little. He
lead been told to be hopeful, and he did not
feel himself to be dying ! while with his
whole heart he wished for life  the young
bright life that was so full of love and joy,
of which no outward trouble, no wearing
anxiety, and no cold and selfish discontent
had rendered him weary. Home and
friends, the long lines of moorland that
were shining in the sunset light, the hardwork
in the world behind and before him,
the answering love of the woman whom he
had chosen, were all beautiful and good to
him ; he felt no need of rest, no lack of

joyce
prayed for his life, not because he

was afraid to die, but because he wished

to live ; and when, with a sort of awful,

solemn curiosity, he tried to realize that

death might be his portion, his thoughts,

not quite under his own control, turned

forcibly to those near to him. If lie was
to die, there were things he must say to
his father, to Jack, to Alvar, a hundred
messages to his friends in the village 
they would let him see Mr. Ellesmere then
when it did not matter how much he
hurt himself by speaking ; but one thing
could not wait 

Alvar, I must say something."

Yes, I can hear," said Alvar, seeing
the necessity, and leaning towards him.

*' When there is no chance, you will tell
me?"

Yes."

But I must tell you about  her  a
secret."

I will keep it. Some one you love ? "

"It is Huth; we are engaged. Does
she know  this ? "

Alvar' s surprise was intense; but he
answered quietly, 

I suppose that Virginia will have told
her."

Let her know ; it would be worse later.
Write to her  you  when it is hopeless."

VOL. II. c

Yes," said Altar.

''My love  ny 0113 love ! And say she
must come and see me once more. She
will  I would go anywhere."

Hush, hush ! my brother ; I understand
you. I am to find out if Virginia
has written to her cousin ; and if you are
worse, I write and ask her if she will
come. I will do it."

Thanks. I can't thank you. Grod
knows how I love her."

'' Not one more word," said Alvar,
steadily. " Now you must rest."

'' I shall get better," said Cherry.

But as the pain grew fiercer, and his
strength grew less, this security failed ;
and then it was well indeed for Cheriton
that, be his desires what they might, he
believed with all his warm heart that it
was a loving Hand that had given him
life both here and hereafter.

Time passed on, and Cheriton still lay
in great danger and suffering. It was a
sorrowful Sunday in Oakby when his name
headed the list of sick persons who were

prayed for in church. Every one could
tell of some boyish prank, some merry
saying, some act of kindness that he had
done ; and now that he was believed to be
dying, be the facts what they might, there
was a sort of sense that he had been
deprived of his rights by his foreign
brother.

It had a deal better a' been yon black-bearded
chap. What's he to us?" many
a one muttered.

Alas ! that the thought would intrude
itself into the father's mind, spite of the
gratitude he could not but feel !

But Alvar went on with his anxious
watching, heeding no one but bis brother.
That Sunday was a day of great suffering
and suspense, and all through the afternoon
came lads from the outlying farms,
children from the village, messengers from
half the neighbourhood to hear the last
report. Silence and quiet were still so
forcibly insisted on, that even Mr. Lester
was advised by the doctor to keep out of
his son's room; but Mr. Ellesmere came
c 2

up to the house at his request and waited,
for all thought that the useless prohibition
would soon be taken away ; and in the
meantime his presence was a support to
the father and grandmother, the latter of
whom, at least, could bear to hear Cheriton
praised.

Towards evening, Alvar, who had scarcely
stirred all day, was sent downstairs by
Mr. Adamson to get some food, and ashe
came into the dining-room, where the
customary Sunday tea was laid on the
table, he was greeted with a start of
alarm. The two poor boys, tired, hungry,
and frightened, had arrived but a few
minutes before, and were standing about
silent and awestruck.

Jack leant on the mantelpiece, with his
lips shut as if they would never unclose
again ; Bob was staring out of the window ;
Nettie sat forlorn on one of a long row of
chairs. Not one of them made an attempt
to comfort or to speak to the others ; they
were almost as inaccessible in the sullen
intensity of their grief as the two dogs.

who, poor things ! shared it, as they sat
staring at Nettie, as dogs will when they
do not comprehend the situation.

Alvar, with his olive face and grave
dark eyes, looked, after all his fatigue, less
changed than Jack, who was deadly pale,
and hardly able to control his trembling.

Ah ! Jack," said Alvar, in his soft,
slow tones, " he will be glad to hear that
you are come ! "

Jack did not speak at first, and Alvar,
as silent as the rest, went up to the table
aLi poured out some claret and took some
bread.

It's quite hopeless, I suppose ? " said
Jack, suddenly.

No, do not say so ! " said Alvar, half
fiercely. 'rit is not so ; but, oh, we fear
it ! " he added, in a voice of inexpressible
melancholy.

Jack could not utter another word  he
was half choking; but Nettie, unable to
restrain herself any longer, began to cry
piteously.

Don't Nettie," said Bob, savagely.

"Ah!" said Alvar, *' poor child, she is
breaking her heart ! " he went over to her,
and took her in his arms and kissed her.
Poor Httle sister \ " he said. " Ah ! how
we love him ! "

The simple expression of the thought
that was aching in the minds of all of them
seemed to give a sort of relief. Nettie
submitted to be caressed and soothed, and
the boys came a little closer, and gave
themselves the comfort of looking as
wretched as they felt.

Now I must eat some supper, for I
dare not stay," said Alvar; 'rand you 
you have been travelling  come and take
some."

The poor boys began to find out how
hungry they were, and Bob began to eat
heartily ; while the force of example made
Jack take a few mouthfuls, till the vicar
came into the room.

Jack," he said quietly, " Cherry is so
very anxious to see you that Mr. Adamson
gives leave for you to go for one moment.
Not the twins  they must wait a little.
Can you stand it ? "

Yes, sir," said Jack, tliougli, great
strong fellow as he was, his knees trembled.


Then, Alvar, are you ready ? Have
you really eaten and rested ? You had
better take him in."

Jack stood for a moment beside the bed,
without attempting a word, hardly able to
see that Cherry smiled at him, till he felt
the hot fingers clasp his with more strength
than he had looked for, and his hand was
put into Alvar' s, while Cheriton held them
both, and whispered, '' Jack, you ivill  "

Yes, Cherry, I will," said Jack, understanding
him. '' I will, always."

There, that must be enough," said
Alvar. '' Jack is very good  he shall come
again."

Oh ! don't send me quite away," whispered
Jack, as they moved a little. " Let
me stay outside. I could go errands  I'll
not stir."

Alvar nodded, and Jack went out into
the deserted gallery, where, of course, he
and Bob were not to sleep at present. The
old sitting-room was full of things required

by the nurses, and Jack sat down on a
little window-seat in the passage, which
looked out towards the stables. He saw
Bob and Nettie arm-in-arm, trying to distract
their minds by visiting their pets,
and his grandmother, too, coming slowly
and heavily to look at her poultry. He
had not seen his father, and dreaded the
thought of the meeting. Idly he watched
the ordinary movement of the servants, the
inquirers coming and going, and he thought
of the brother, best loved of all and most
loving  oh ! if he could but hear Cherry
laugh at him again !

Upstairs all was silent, save for poor
Cheriton's painful cough and difficult
breathing ; and presently it seemed to Jack
that the cough was less frequent, till, after
an interval of stillness, the doctor came
out. Jack's heart stood still. Was this
the fatal summons ?

'' Your brother is asleep," said Mr.
Adamson. " I feel more hopeful. I am
obliged to go, but I shall be here early.
Every one who is not wanted had better goto
bed."

He went downstairs as lie spoke, but
Jack remained where he was, thinking he
might be at least useful in taking messages
or calling people. He had never sat up all
night before, and, anxious as he was, the
hours were woefully long.

Once or twice his grandmother came to
the head of the stairs, and Jack signalled
that all was quiet. At last, over the stable
clock, the dawn came creeping up ; there
was the solitary note of a bird, then a
great twitter and the cawing of the rooks.

Jack put his head out of the window, and
felt the fresh, sharp air blowing in his face.
A cock crowed  would it wake Cherry?
Some one touched him on the shoulder;
he drew his head in, and Alvar stood by his
side.

He is much better," he said. *' He has
been so long asleep, and now the pain is less,
and he can breathe  he is much better."

Jack was afraid to speak, but he gave
Alvar' s hand a great squeeze.

Now, will you go and tell my father

this ? Ah, how he will rejoice ! But do
not let him come."

Jack sped downstairs and to Lis father's
door, which opened at the sound of a footstep.


Papa, he is better. Alvar says he will
get well."

Half a dozen hasty questions and answers,
then Mr. Lester put Jack away from
him and shut his door.

They could hardly believe that the relief
was more than a respite, but the gleam of
hope brightened as the day advanced.
Cherry slept again, and woke, able to speak
and say that he was better.

And I must tell you, sir," said Mr.
Adam son, afterwards, " that it is in a great
measure owing to your son's good nursing."


Mr. Lester turned round to Alvar, who
was beside him.

I owe you a debt nothing can repay.
I can never thank you for my boy's life,"
he said, warmly.

Ah, do you than me ? You insult
me ! " cried Alvar, suddenly and fiercely.
*' Is he more to you than to me  my one

friend  my brother  Cherito mio ! " And ,
completely overcome, Alvar clasped his
hands over his face and dashed out of the
room.

Jack followed ; but his admiration of
Alvar's self-control was somewhat shaken
by the sort of fury of indignation and emotion
that seemed to stifle him, as he poured
out a torrent of words, half Spanish, half
English, walking about the room and shedding
tears of excitement.

I say," said Jack, " they won't let you
go in to Cherry next, and then what will
he do?"

Alvar subsided after a few moments, and
said, simply and rather sadly, 

It is that my father does not understand
me. But no matter  Cherry is
better  all is right now."

CHAPTER XX.

FACE TO FACE.

And with such words  a lie !  a lie !
She broke my heart and flung it by."

In the early days of August, after as long
a delay as she could find excuse for, Ruth
Seyton returned to Elderthwaite, knowing
that Rupert was to come next week to
Oakby for the grouse shooting, and that
Cheriton was ready to claim her promise ;
for as she came on the very day of her
arrival to a garden-party at Mrs. EUes-mere's,
she held in her pocket a letter
written in defiance of her prohibition, urging
her to let him speak to her again, and
full of love and longing for her presence.

She knew that Rupert was coming, for
the quarrel between them was at an end.
Ruth had been very dull and desolate during

her quiet visit to some old friends of her
mother's, very much shocked at hearing
from Virginia of Cherry's illness, and more
self-reproachful for having let him linger
in the damp shrubberies by her side than
for the greater injury she had done him.

She wrote on the spur of the moment,
and sent Alvar a kind message of sympathy;
but every day her promise to Cheriton
seemed more unreal, and when at last
Rupert came, ashamed of the foolish dispute,
and only wanting to laugh at and
forget it, she yielded to his first word, and,
though a little hurt to find how lightly he
could regard a lover's quarrel, was too
happy to forgive and be forgiven. But
one thing she knew that he would not
have forgiven, and that was her reception
of Cheriton' s offer, and though it had
never entered into her theories of life to
deceive the real lover, she let it pass unconfessed
 nay, let Eupert suppose, though
she did not put it in words, that she had
discovered " Cheriton' s folly " in time to
put it aside.

That she must shortly meet them both,
and in each other's presence, was the one
thought hi her mind, even while she heard
from Virginia that Cherry was almost well
again, and detected a touch of chagrin in
her eager account of Alvar's clever and constant
care. *' No, she had not seen him yesterday,
but they would all meet to-day."

Still it was startling, when the two girls
came out into the garden of the rectory,
to see in the sunshine Cheriton Lester with
a mallet in his hand, looking tall and delicate,
but with a face of eager greeting
turned full on her own.

In another moment he held her hand ina
close, tight grasp, as she dropped her
eyes and hoped that he was better.

Quite well now," said Cheriton, in a
tone that Ruth fancied every one must
interpret truly.

That is, when he obeys orders," said
another voice ; and Ruth felt her heart
stand still, for Rupert came up to Cheriton' s
side and held out his hand to her.

For the first time in her life she was

sorry to see him. Lie could have screamed
with the surprise, and her face betrayed
an agitation that made Cheriton's heart
leap, as he attributed it to her meeting
with him after his dangerous illness.

''I am quite well," he repeated. " I
am not going to give any more trouble, I
hope, now."

Rupert looked unusually full of spirits.
'good news," he whispered to Ruth, with
a smile of triumph. She could hardly
smile back at him. Alvar now came up
and spoke to them. He looked very grave;
as Ruth fancied, reproachful.

Some one asked Ruth to play croquet,
and she declined ; then felt as if the game
would have been a refuge. But she took
what seemed the lesser risk, and walked
away with Rupert ; and Cheriton tried in
vain for the opportunity of a word with
her  she eluded him, he hardly knew how.
The sense of suspicion and suspense which
had been growing all through the later
weeks of his recovery was coming to a
point.

Ruth seemed like a mocking fairy, like
some unreliable vision, as he saw her smiling
and gracious  nay, answered occasional
remarks from her  but could never meet
her eyes, nor obtain from her one real
response.

These perpetual, impalpable rebuffs
raised such a tumult in Cheriton's mind
that he restrained himself with a forcible
effort from some desperate measure which
should oblige her to listen to him, while
all his native reticence and pride could
hardly afford him self-control enough to
play his part without discovery.

An equal sense of baffled discomfort
pressed on Virginia. She had very seldom
seen a cloud on Alvar's brow; he never
committed such an act of discourtesy as
to be out of temper in her presence ; but
to-day he looked so stern as to prompt her
to say, timidly, '' Has anything vexed you,
Alvar ? "

How could I be vexed when you are
here, queen of my heart?" said Alvar,
turning to her with a smile. *' See, will

you come to get some strawberries  it is
hot?"

'' I would rather you told me when
things trouble you," said Virginia.

It is not for you, mi dona, to hear of
things that are troubling," said Alvar, still
rather abstractedly.

'rare you still anxious about Cherry? "
she persisted.

Ay de mi, yes ; I am anxious about
him," said Alvar, sharply ; then changing,
"but I am ungallant to show you my
anxiety. That is not for you."

"Ah, how you misunderstand what I
want ! " she cried. " If I only knew what
you feel, if you would talk to me about
yourself ! But it is like giving an Eastern
lady fine dresses and sugar-plums."

The gentle Virginia was angry and
agitated. All through Cheriton's illness
she had felt herself kept at a distance by
Alvar, known herself unable to comfort
him, had suffered pangs that were like
enough to jealousy, to intensify themselves
by self-reproach. Yet she gloried in Alvar's

VOL. II. D

devotion to his brother, in his skill and
tenderness. Altar did not perceive what
she wanted, and, moreover, was of course
unable to tell her the present cause of his
annoyance, at the existence of which he
did not wish her to guess.

See now," he said, taking her hands
and kissing them,. " how I am discourteous ;
I am sulky, and I let you see it. Forgive
me, forgive me, it shall be so no more.
You shed tears ; ah, my queen, they reproach
me ! "

Virginia yielded to his caresses and his
kindness, and blamed herself. Some day,
perhaps, in a quieter moment, she could
show him that she wanted to share his
troubles and not be protected from them.
In the meantime his presence was almost
enough.

Altar, like some others of his name, was
a person of slow perceptions, and was apt
to be absorbed in one idea at a time. He
did not guess that while he paid Virginia
all the courtesy that he thought her due
she longed for a far closer union of spirits.

He was proud of being Cheriton's chief
dependence during the tedious recovery
that none of the others could bear to think
incomplete, and to find that his tact and
consideration made him a welcome companion
when Jack's ponderous discussions
were too great a fatigue. But he would
not endure thanks, and after the outburst
with which he had received his father's
nobody proffered them. Not one of the
others, full of anger with Ruth and of
anxiety for Cheriton, could have abstained
from fretting him with one word on the
subject, as Alvar did all that afternoon
and evening. But his mind was free to
think of nothing else.

As for Ruth, the moment that should
have been full of unalloyed bliss for
her, the moment when Rupert told her
that concealment was no longer necessary,
was distracted 'by the terror of discovery.


Rupert had to tell her that the sale of a
farm, effected on unusually advantageous
terms, had made the declaration of his

wishes possible to him, and lie was now
ready to present himself before lier guardians
and ask their consent to a regular
engagement. Ruth was about to go back
to her grandmother, and all might now
be well. Ruth did not know how to be
glad ; she could not tell how deeply the
Lesters might blame her. Her one hope
was in Cheriton's generosity, and to him
at least she must tell the whole truth.

To-morrow I shall come and see you,"
he said gravely, as he wished her goodnight,
and she managed to give him an
assenting glance, but he knew that she
was treating him ill, and tormented himself
with a thousand fancies  that his illness
had changed him, that something during
their separation had changed her. He
said nothing, but the next day started
alone for Elderthwaite.

It was a bright morning, with a clear
blue sky. Cheriton passed into the wood
and through the flickering shadows of the
larches. He did not spend the time of his
walk in forming any plans as to how he

should meet Ruth ; he set his mind on throne
fact that a meeting was certain. But
perhaps the brightness of the morning influenced
his mood, for as he came out onto
the bit of bare hill-side that divided the
wood from the Elderthwaite property, a
certain happiness of anticipation possessed
him  circumstances might account for the
discomfort of the preceding day, Ruth's
eyes might once more meet his own, her
voice once more tell him that she loved
him.

The bit of fell was divided from Mr.
Seyton's plantation [by a low stone wall,
mossy, and overgrown with clumps of harebells
and parsley fern, and half smothered
by the tall brackens and brambles that
grew on either side of it. Beyond were a
few stunted, ill-grown oak-trees, with a
wild undergrowth of hazel.

As Cheriton came across the soft, smooth
turf of the hill side, he became aware that
some one was sitting on the wall beside the
wide gap that led into the plantation, and
he quickened his steps with a thrill of hope

as he recognized Ruth. She stood up ashe
approached and waited for him, as he
exclaimed eagerly, 

This is too good of you ! "

Oh, no ! " said Ruth, and began to
cry.

Her eyes were red already, and with her
curly hair less deftly arranged than usual,
and her little black hat pushed back from
her face, she had an air indescribably
childish and forlorn.

Every thought of resentment passed
from Cheriton's mind, he was by her side
in a moment, entreating to be told of her
trouble, and in his presence the telling of
her story was so dreadful to her that
perhaps nothing but the knowledge of
Rupert's neighbourhood could have induced
her to do it. Ruth hated to be in disgrace,
and genuine as were her tears, she was not
without a thought of prepossessing him in
her favour. But she could not run the
risk of Rupert's suddenly coming through
the fir-wood.

Please come this way," she said, breaking

from him and skirting along inside the
wall till they were out of sight of the pathway.
Then she began, averting her face
and plucking at the fern-leaves in the
wall.

'' I  I don't know how to tell you, but
you are so good and kind and generous, so
much  much better than I am  you won't
be hard on me."

It doesn't take much goodness to make
me feel for your trouble," said Cheriton,
tenderly. " Tell me, my love, and see if I
am hard."

Every one is hard on a girl who has
been as foolish as I have."

Cheriton began to think that she was
going to tell him of some undue encouragement
given to some other lover in his
absence or before her promise to him, and
to believe that here was the explanation of
all that had perplexed him.

I shall never be offended when you tell
me that I have no cause for offence," he said,
putting his hand down on hers as she
fingered the fern-leaves.

'' Indeed, I would not have deceived
you so long, but for your illness," said
Ruth, a little more firmly.

Deceived me ! Dearest, don't use such
hard words of yourself. Tell me what all
this means. What fancy is this ? "

' Will you promise  promise me to be
generous and to forgive me ? Oh, you may
ruin all my life if you will," said Ruth,
passionately.

'' I ruin your life ! ah, you little know !
When my life was given back to me, I was
glad because it belonged to you," said
Cheriton, faltering in his earnestness.

Then oh! Cherry, Cherry," cried Ruth,
suddenly turning on him and clasping her
hands, " then give me back my foolish
promise  forget it altogether  let us befriends
as we were when I was a little girl.
Oh, Cherry, forgive me  I cannot  cannot
do it ! "

'' What can you mean ? " said Cheriton,
slowly, and with so little evidence of surprise
that Ruth took courage to go on.

Cherry ! " she repeated, as if clinging

to the name that marked her old relation
to him ; " Cherry, a long time ago  last
spring, I was engaged to some one else 
to your cousin ; but it suited him  us 
to say nothing of it at first. And oh ! I
was jealous and foolish, and we quarrelled,
and I was in a passion, and thought to
show him I didn't care. And you came
that day at Milford, and I knew how good
you were, and you begged so hard I
couldn't resist you  you gave me no time.
And then very soon he came back, and I
knew I had made a mistake. I would have
told you at once, indeed I would, but for
your illness. How could I then ? "

Cheriton stood looking at her, and while
she spoke, his astonished gaze grew stern
and piercing, till she shrank from him and
turned away. Then he said, with a sort
of incredulous amazement, with which
rising anger contended, 

'' Then you never meant what you said?
When you told me that you loved me, it
was false  you did not mean to give yourself
to me ? You kissed me to deceive me ?"

Oh, Cheriton ! " sobbed Ruth, covering
her face, " don't  don't put it like that.
I was very  very foolish  very wicked,
but it was not all plain in that way. Won't
you forgive me ? I was so very unhappy !
I thought you were always kind  "

Kind ! " ejaculated Cheriton. '' There
is only one way of putting it ! Which is
your lover, to which of us are you promised,
to Rupert or to me ? "

Anger, scorn, and a pain as yet hardly
felt, intensified Cheriton' s accent. She
had expected him to plead for himself, to
bemoan his loss, and instead she shrank
and quailed before his judgment of her
deceit. His last words awoke a spark of
defiance, and suddenly, desperately, she
faced him and said, clearly, 

"To Rupert."

Cheriton put his hand back and leant
against the wall. He was beginning to
feel the force of the blow. After a moment
he raised his head, and looked at her
again, with a face now pale and mournful.


Oh, Ruth, is it indeed so ? Have I
nothing to hope  nothing even to remember
T' Did you never mean it  never? "

I was so angry  so miserable that I
was mad," faltered Ruth. " I thought he
was false to me."

So you took me in to make up for it ? "
said Cheriton roughly, his indignation
again gaining ground. '* "Well, I should
thank you for at last undeceiving me ! "

He turned as if to go ; but Ruth sobbed
out, '' I know it was very wrong, indeed
I am sorry for you. I can never, never
be happy, if you don't forgive me."

"What can you mean by forgiving?"
said Cheriton bitterly. '* I wish I had
died before I knew this ! You have deceived
me and made a fool of me, while I
thought you  I thought you  "

*' Then," cried Ruth, stung by the change
of feeling his words implied, *' you can
tell them all about it if you will, and ruin
me!"

What ! " exclaimed Cheriton, starting
upright. " Is that what you can think

possible ? Is that wlij you are crying ?
You may be perfectly happy! The promise
you lead the prudence to exact lias
been unbroken. 'No I when I thought that
I was dying, I told Alvar that yoio might
be spared any shock. Neither he nor I
are likely to speak of it further. I had
better wish you good-morning."

It was Cheriton whose love had been
scorned, whose hopes had all been dashed
to the ground in the last half-hour, and
who had received a blow that had changed
the world for him ; but it had come in
such a, form that the injured self-respect
struggled for self-preservation. The first
effect on his clear, upright nature was incredulous
anger, a sense of resistance, of
shame and scorn, that, all-contending and
half suppressed, made him terrible to Ruth,
whose self-deceit had expected quite another
reception of her words. She had shrunk
from the idea of giving him pain, had
dreaded the confession of her own misdeeds;
but she had indemnified her conscience
to herself for ill-treating Cheriton

by a sort of unnatural and unreal admiration
of what she called his goodness ;
which seemed to her to render self-abnegation
natural, if not easy, to him.

She, with her passionate feelings, her
warm heart, might be forgiven for error ;
but he, since he was high-principled and religious,
would surely make it easier for her,
would stand in an ideal relation to her and
tellherthat "her happiness was dearer than
his own." 'good" people were capable
of that sort of self-sacrificing devotion. She
thought, as many do, that Cheriton's battle
was less hard to fight, because he had hitherto
had the strength to win it. Poor boy,
it had come to the forlorn hope now ! He
only knew that he must not turn and fly.

As Kuth looked up at him all tear-stained
and deprecatory, his mood changed.

Oh, Ruth, Ruth Ruth ! " he cried, ashe
turned away, " and I loved you so ! "

But he left her without a touch of the
hand ; without a parting, without a pardon.
No other relations could replace for him
those she had destroyed. Ruth watched

him liurrj across the fell and into the fir-wood,
and then, as she sank down among
the ferns and gave way to a final burst of
misery, she thought to herself, ''Oh, Rupert,
Rupert, what I have endured for your
sake ! "

CHAPTER XXI.

IN THE THICK OF THE FIGHT.

Oh, that 'twere I had been false  not she ! "

In the meantime the unconscious Rupert
was strolling up and down in front of the
house waiting for his uncle to come out,
and intending to take him into his confidence
and ask for his good offices with
Ruth's guardians. It was well for her that
he had no suspicion of what was passing ;
for little as she guessed it, he would have
greatly resented her treachery towards
Cheriton as well as towards himself. But
Rupert was in high spirits, and when Mr.
Lester joined him, he told his tale with
the best grace that he could. His uncle
was pleased with the news, and questioned
him pretty closely upon all its details,

shook this head over the previous difficulties
which Rupert admitted, told him that he
was quite right to be open with him, congratulated
him when he owned to having
met with success with the lady herself,
and, pleased with being consulted, threw
himself heart and soul into the matter.

As they came up towards the back of the
house, they met Alvar, who, rather hastily,
asked if they had seen Cheriton.

''He went to take a walk. I am afraid
he will be tired," he explained.

"Eh, Alvar, you're too fidgety," said
his father good-humouredly. " There's
Cheriton, looking at the puppies."

Alvar looked, and beheld a group
gathered in the doorway of a great barn,
the figures standing out clear in the sunshine
against the dark shadow behind.
Nettie was standing in the centre with her
arms apparently full of whining little
puppies ; the mother, a handsome retriever,
was yelping and whining near. Buffer
was barking and dancing in a state of
frantic jealousy beside her. Bob and Jack

were disputing over the merits of the
puppies. Dick Seyton, with a cigar in his
mouth, was leaning lazily against the barn
door, while Cheriton, looking, to Alvar's
anxious eyes, startlingly pale, was standing
near.

*' But say. Cherry, say," urged Nettie,
*' which of them are to be kept ? Don't
you think this is the best of all ? "

That," interrupted Bob, " that one
will never be worth anything. Look,
Cherry, this one's head  "

"Bob, what are you about here at this
time in the morning ? " said his father.
I told you I must have some work done
these holidays. Be off with you at once."

Cherry said yesterday he would come
and help me," growled Bob.

I want him," said Mr. Lester. '' Got
a piece of news for you. Cherry. No
secret, Rupert, I suppose ? "

I'll tell Cherry presently," said Rupert,
thinking the audience large and embarrassing.


Cheriton started, and the unseeing look

VOL. II. E

went out of his eyes, and for one moment
lie looked at Rupert as if lie could have
knocked him down. Then the reflection
of his own look on Alvar's face brought
back the instinct of concealment, the self-respect
that held its own, while all their
voices sounded strange and confused, and
he could not tell how often his father had
spoken to him or how long ago.

I think I can guess your news," he
said. " But I must go in. Come back to
the house with me, Rupert."

He spoke rather slowly, but much in his
usual manner. Rupert was aware that the
news might not be altogether pleasant to
him; but he had the tact to turn away
with him at once ; while Alvar watched
them in utter surprise, the wildest surmises
floating through his mind. But what Cherry
wanted was to hear whether Rupert would
confirm what Ruth had told him ; somehow
he could not feel sure if it were true.

How long have you been engaged ? "
he said ; " that was what you were going
to tell me, wasn't it ? "

"My uncle is frightfully indiscreet,"
said Eupert, with a conscious laugh.
Nothing has been settled yet with the
authorities ; but we have understood each
other for some time. She  she's one ina
thousand, and I don't deserve my
luck."

Rupert was very nervous ; he had always
thought that Cheriton had a boyish fancy
for Ruth, though he was far from imagining
its extent, and he was divided between
a sense of triumph over him and a most
real desire not to let the triumph be apparent,
or to give him unnecessary pain. Being
successful, he could afford to be generous,
and talked on fast lest Cherry should say
something for which he might afterwards
be sorry.

I suppose we haven't kept our secret
so well as we thought," he said, laughing,
as you guessed it so quickly. All last
spring I was afraid of Alvar's observations."


Did Alvar know ? He might have 
he might  ? " Cheriton stopped abruptly,
E 2

Oe-iT

conscious only of passion hitherto unknown.
He never marvelled afterwards at
tales of sudden wild revenge. In that first
hour of bitter wrong he could have killed
Rupert, had a weapon been in his hand,
have challenged him to a deadly duel, had
such a thought been instinctive to his
generation. Eupert did not look at him,
or the wrath in his eyes must have betrayed
him. He longed to revenge himself,
to tell Rupert all ; even his sense of honour
shook and faltered in the storm. " She
promised me ! She kissed me I " The
words seemed to sound in his ears, something
within held them back from his lips.
Another moment, and Alvar touched his
arm.

Come in, Cherito, the wind is cold," he
said. " Come in with me."

Rupert, glad to close the interview, little
as he guessed how it might have ended,
turned away, saying, with a hae-laugh, " I
must go and check Uncle Gerald's communications
; they are too premature."

Then Cheriton felt himself tremble from

head to foot ; lie knew that Alvar was
talking, uttering words of vehement sympathy,
but he could not tell what they
were.

*' You came in time  you came in time
to save me ! " said Cheriton wildly, as his
senses began to recover their balance. He
turned away his face for a few moments,
then spoke collectedly.

Thank you. That is all over now !
You see I'm not strong yet. You will not
see me like this again. The one thing is
to prevent any one from guessing, above
all my father."

But, my brother, how can you  you
cannot conceal from all that you suffer ? "
said Alvar, dismayed.

Cannot I ? I will'' said Cheriton,
with his mouth set, while his hands still
trembled.

"Why? You have done no wrong,"
said Alvar. '' Are you the first who has
been deceived by a faithless woman ? She
is but a woman, my brother; there are
others. You feel now that you could stab

your rival to revenge yourself. Ah, that
will pass ; she's only a woman. Heavens !
I tore my hair. I wept. I told all my
friends of my despair ; it was the sooner
over. , You will find others."

We usually keep our disappointments
to ourselves," said Cheriton coldly. "1
could not forgive any betrayal. Now I'll
go in by myself. I'll come down to lunch.
As you say, I'm not the first fellow who
has been made a fool of."

What will he do ? " thought Alvar ashe
reluctantly left him. ''He would forgive
his rival sooner than himself. They
pretend to feel nothing, my brothers, that
gives them much trouble. If I were to
tell a falsehood to please them, they would
despise me ; but Cherito will tell many
falsehoods to hide that he grieves."

Cheriton gathered himself up enough to
hide his rage and grief, hardly enough in
any way to struggle with them, and the
suffering was as uncontrollable and as
exhausting as the pain and fever of his
late illness. It shut out even more completely

the remembrance of anything but
his own sensations. And it was all so
bitter  he felt the injury so keenly  he had
not yet power to feel the loss. He kept
up well, however, and during the next two
or three days his father saw nothing amiss ;
while Altar, though anxious about his
health, regarded the misery as a phase
that must have its way. But Nettie
declared that Cherry was cross, and Jack,
who had lately acquired the habit of
noticing him, felt that he was not himself.
It was difficult to define ; but it seemed to
him as if his brother never looked, spoke
or acted exactly as might have been
expected. Things seemed to pass him

by.

The twelfth of August proving hopelessly
wet and wild, even Mr. Lester could
not think his joining the shooting party
allowable, and Cheriton expressed a
proper amount of disappointment; but
Jack recollected that when they had all
been speculating on the weather the night
before, Cherry had hardly turned his head

to look at it. He would not let Alvar stay
at home with him, and felt glad to be free
from observation.

In the meantime matters bad not gone
much more pleasantly at Eldertliwaite.
Rntli was in such dread of discovery that
even in Rupert's presence she could not beat
ease. Her conscience reproached her,
and she was by no means sure that
Rupert was quite unsuspicious, for he
talked a good deal about his cousin, and
once said that he thought him much
changed by his illness. Neither was she
happy with Virginia, towards whom a certain
amount of confidence was necessary,
as she could not lead her to suppose that
all had been freshly settled with Rupert ;
and Virginia, who was usually reticent
and shy, questioned her closely as to
Rupert's behaviour and modes of action.
Indeed she marvelled at her cousin's
ignorance, for Alvar seemed to her to imply
displeasure in every look. He came seldom
to Eldertliwaite, and, when there, scarcely
spoke of Cherry. Ruth could only hurry

lier return to her grandmother, which was
to take place in a few days ; but an Oakby
dinner-party, in honour of the engagement,
could not be avoided. Ruth dared
not have a head ache or a cold, and in a
tremor most unlike her usual self she prepared
to meet her two lovers face to face.
If Cheriton had any mercy for her, or any
feeling for himself, he would avoid her.
How little she had once thought ever to be
afraid of Cherry ! But he was there, with
a flower in his coat, and plenty of conversation,
apparently on very good terms
with Rupert, and facing the greeting with
entire composure. He even ate his dinner ;
he sat, not opposite Ruth, but low down
on the other side of the table, while she
had Alvar for her neighbour  a very silent
one, as Virginia, on his other side,
remarked with a sigh. It would have
been natural for her to talk to Rupert,
who sat on the other side of her, but she
felt Cheriton' s eyes on her in all their
peculiar intenseness of expression. Ruth
was very sensitive, and they seemed to

mesmerize lier ; she grew absolutely pale,
and lie knew that Rupert saw it. How
could Cheriton be so cruel !

Her white face and drooping lip flashed
the same thought to Cheriton himself.
What a coward he was thus to revenge
himself ! He turned his head away with a
sudden rush of softening feeling. Disappointed
love and jealousy had, she told
him, driven her mad  what were they
making of him? At least it was more
manly to let her alone.

Cheriton, I want a word with you,"
said Rupert, turning into the smoking-room
when the party was over. " Of
course, you have a right to refuse to
answer me, but  I can't but observe your
manner. Do you consider yourself in anyway
aggrieved by my engagement ? "

It did not occur to Cheriton that, if
Rupert had had full trust in Ruth, he
would never have put such a question.
He was conscious of such unusual feelings
that he knew not how far he stood self-betrayed
in manner. Rupert was his

cousin, almost as intimate as a brother,
and lie could not resent the question quite
as if it lead come from a stranger. It
could have been answered by a short
negative, leaving the sting that had
prompted it where it had been before.
Full of passion and resentment as Cheriton
still was, he could not now have broken
his word and deliberately betrayed the girl
who had betrayed him.

He was silent for a minute ; still another
part was open. At last he looked up at
E-upert and said, 

'' I made her an offer  she has refused
me. Don't mind my way  there's an end
of it."

Cherry, you're a good fellow, a real
good fellow  thank you ! " said Rupert
warmly. "I'm sorry, with all my heart."

'' Don't think about me," repeated
Cheriton rather stiffly. "But I'll say
good-night."

He was so obviously putting a great
force on himself that Rupert, feeling that
he could not be the one to offer sympathy,

would not detain him; but as lie gave
his hand a hearty squeeze, Cherry, with
another great effort, said, 

*' I cZo wish her  happiness," then turned
away and hurried upstairs.

CHAPTER XXII.

Struggling.

And my faith is torn to a thousand scraps,
And my heart feels ice while my words breathe flame."

It was a wild, wet morning, some days
after the Oakby dinner-party. Summer
weather was apt in those regions to be invaded
in August by something very like
autumn ; bits of brown and yellow appeared
here and there among the green,
and fires became essential. To-day the
mist was driving past the windows of the
boys' sitting-room, blotting out the view,
till the wind rent it apart and showed dim
sweeps of distant moor.

Bob Lester was sitting at the table,
with his eyes fixed, not on the exceedingly
inky copy of Virgil before him, but on the
window, as he remarked dolefully, 

Birds are wild enough already, without
all this wind to make them worse."

Jack was writing at the other end of
the table ; Nettie, with an old waterproof
cloak on, was kneeling on the window-seat,
watching the weather, with Buffer, apparently
similarly occupied, by her side ;
and Cheriton, with considerable sharpness
of manner, was endeavouring to drive the
Latin lesson into Bob's head.

For Bob was under discipline. Such a
bad report of him had come from school
as to idleness, troublesomeness, and general
misbehaviour, that his father, after a private
interview, the nature of which Bob
did not disclose, had ordered a certain
amount of work to be done every day, to
be taken back to school, and had forbidden
a gun or a fishing-rod to be touched till
this was accomplished. Cherry in the
early days of his convalescence, had received
Bob's growls on the subject, and
had offered to help him, as Jack's efforts
as a tutor were not found to answer, and
had actually coaxed a certain amount of

information into him. Lately, however,
the lessons had not gone off so well.
Cheriton had made a great point of them,
and held Bob as if in a vice by the force
of his will ; bnt he was sarcastic instead
of playful, and contemptuous instead of
encouraging, and now lost patience, laying
down his book and speaking in a cutting,
incisive tone that made Bob start and
stare.

We have all got aims in life, I suppose ;
I wish we were all as likely to succeed in
them as you are, Bob."

I haven't got an aim in life," said Bob,
turning round as if affronted.

*' No ? I thought your aim was to bethe
greatest dunce in the county. It's
well to know one's own line, and do a thing
ivell while one's about it. A low aim's a
mistake in all things."

Jack laid down his pen, and stared hard
at Cheriton. Bob waited unconscious,
expecting the smile and twinkle that took
the sting out of all Cherry's mischief, but
none came.

*' Come now, you needn't be down on
a fellow in that way," lie said, angrily.
My line mayn't be yours, but I'll  I'll
stick to it one day."

I just observed that you were sticking
to it now, heart and soul. Let all your
wits lie fallow ; with the skill and energy
you are showing at present, you may get
to the level of a ploughboy in time."

I say. Cherry," said Jack, *' that's a
little strong."

Bob shut the book with a bang and
stood up.

"I'm not going to stand that," he said ;
and Cheriton recollected himself and
coloured. " I beg your pardon, Bob," he
said. " It was too bad. I  I was only
joking. Will you go on now ? "

No," said Bob. '' I won't be made
game of."

'' You tire Cherry to death," said Jack.
'* No wonder he loses patience."

*' I didn't ask him to do it," said Bob.
*' Nettie, where are you going? "

*' Out," said Nettie, briefly.

'' Then I'm going too," said Bob, following
her ; while Cheriton wearily threw
himself down on the cushions in the
window-seat and in his turn stared out at
the mist. Jack sat and watched him. He
had never uttered a word even to Alvar,
but he was full of anxiety. What was the
matter with Cherry ?

He was lively enough at meal-times
and with his father and grandmother ; he
had resumed all his usual habits, except
that the bad weather had prevented him
from going out shooting. He had laughed
at Alvar for being over-anxious about
him, and had taken a great deal of unnecessary
trouble about sundry village
matters and affairs at home. He had
talked what Alvar called 'philosophy"
to Jack with unusual seriousness ; and
yet Jack, with whom perhaps he was least
on his guard, missed something. And
then Mrs. Ellesmere had remarked that
she did not like to see Cheriton with such
a pink colour and such black circles round
his eyes, and had warned her husband not

VOL. II. P

to let him fatigue himself on some walk
they were taking. Surely Cherry coughed
oftener, and was more easily tired, than
he had been ten days ago.

Jack could bear it no longer, and began,
severely 

Cherry, you shouldn't worry yourself
with Bob. It's too much for you."

JSTot generally," said Cheriton. " I'm
tired to-day."

'' What's the matter with you. Cherry ? "
said Jack, coming nearer.

'the matter?" said Cherry, sitting up,
and laughing more in his usual way.
What should be the matter ? Are you
taking a leaf out of Alvar's book ? Of
course, one isn't very strong after such
an illness, and I don't sleep always. I
shall go away, I think, soon, and then I
shall be right enough."

'* Where will you go to ? Let me go
with you. Or must it be Altar ? "

Oh, I shall be best alone. Don't
worry. Jack. I'm no worse, really."

Poor Cheriton ! His efforts at concealment,

made half in pride, and half
in consideration, were not very successful.


As he lay awake through the long-nights,
Ruth's woeful look and appealing
eyes haunted him, and as he remembered
their parting, his own bitter scorn came
back on him with a pang, partly, no doubt,
because she was still irresistible to him,
but partly, also, because he knew that he
had felt the temptation under Which she
had fallen. She had treated him shamefully
; and she declared that her excuse
was, if excuse it could be called, that she
had been driven so frantic by her misjudgment
of Rupert, that anything seemed
legitimate that would give him pain. She
had transgressed every code of womanly
honour, and had cost Cheriton pain beyond
expression by obeying a sudden impulse of
mortified passion. Any sort of revenge on
her by Cheriton was at least as incompatible
with any standard of social obligation,
no extra high principle was needed
to condemn it ; to take such a blow and
r 2

be silent over it seemed a mere matter
of course. Cheriton was very higli-prin-
cipher, lie lead conquered in this time strong
temptations ; moreover, lie was more than
commonly loving and tender, and yet he
felt that there had been more than one
moment when he might have committed
this utter baseness. He forgot for a
moment that he had conquered, that
strength, however unconscious, had come
to him from his former struggles, and had
held him back ; he felt that if this were
possible to him, he was safe from nothing.
He shuddered as he thought of his interview
with Rupert, and his first prayer
since the blow turned into a thanksgiving.


But any thought of his own conduct
was soon swept away by the rush of regret
and pain. She had failed him, however
unworthy he might be to judge her ; and
as he remembered the many sweet and enchanting
moments that had led up to his
final disappointment, he could not but feel
that she had deliberately deceived him.

And yet  and yet  as he recalled her face
at the dinner-table, he knew that he would
have come back to her at a word ; he felt
as if life was worth nothing without
her, as if father and brothers, home, interests,
and ambitions had all lost their
charm. Cheriton retained enough command
over himself to resolve to make head
against this state of mingled regret and
bitterness ; he could not yet bring himself
to accept it with any sort of submission
; his feelings of gratitude and joy at
his returning strength seemed almost as
if they had been sent in mockery to
make disappointment more cruel. But
this thought brought its own remedy.
His life had been given back to him, not
surely only that he might endure this
fierce trial  something would come out of
the furnace. And when he remembered
what his well-being was to his father, the
resolution of self-conquest was made in
something else than pride. "God help
me. I'll learn my lesson ! " he thought ;
and he dimly felt that that lesson meant

more than putting a bold face on things,
or even than a surface recovery of spirits,
of the probability of which last he was of
course then no judge. It meant whether
this bitter trial was to leave him more or
less of a man than it found him  more of
a Christian if he would not be less of a
man.

It must not be supposed that Cheriton
at this time attained with any permanence
to such convictions  he worked his way
to them at intervals ; but, after all, most
of his sleepless hours were spent in a hopeless
involuntary recall of his past happiness.
Ruth haunted him as if she had
been a spirit, and of course the overfatigue
produced by the effort to force his
mind into its usual channels affected his
health, and made him still less able to
fight against his troubles.

He was very reluctant to confess himself
beaten, and began to talk to Jack with
would-be eagerness about going to London
and beginning his reading for the bar. His
name had been entered at the Temple,

most of his ** dinners " were eaten, and he
had never intended his time of waiting fora
brief to be an idle one. Presently his
father called him, and he started up and
went downstairs, while Jack went back to
his writing with divided attention, and dim
suspicions of the truth gaining ground.

Meanwhile Cheriton found himself called
to a conference in the study.

All the arrangements for Alvar's marriage
had been deferred through Cheriton' s
illness, and Mr. Lester felt it somewhat
strange that he should be the first person
who saw the need of recommencing them.
He told Alvar that he wished to speak to
him, and made a sort of apology to him
for Cheriton' s presence by saying that he
wished him to hear the money arrangements
which he thought fit to make.

*' I am sure, Alvar," said Mr. Lester, formally,
" you have shown great unselfishness
in putting your own affairs so completely
on one side during your brother's illness;
but now there is no longer any reason for
deferring the consideration of your marriage,

and I should be glad to know what
plans you may have formed for the
future."

'rit is your wish, sir, that I should be
married  soon ? " said Alvar, coolly and
deferentially.

'' Why  October was mentioned from
the first, wasn't it ? " said Mr. Lester, with
a sort of taken-aback manner that made
Cheriton smile.

*' Yes," said Alvar. " If that is your
desire, and Mr. Seyton approves, I- should
wish it."

Why  why  haven't you settled it all
with Virginia ? "

I did not think one should trouble a
lady with those matters, nor did I wish to
marry while my brother might need me."

That was very good of you ; but I hope
by that time to be in London,' ' said Cherry,
decidedly, and with a look, conveying caution.


Alvar was silent for a moment, and then
said, with what Cheriton called his princely
air, 

*' I shall then marry in October, and I
will take my wife to visit my friends and
my  other country."

** Why, yes \ that would be very proper,
no doubt ; and I think you once told me
that you wished to take a house in London."


That would be good luck for me," said
Cherry, by way of encouragement.

Yes," said Alvar, " I wish it to be
so."

Mr. Lester then entered into an explanation
of the means which he was prepared
to place at Alvar's disposal, talked of
house rent and of Virginia's fortune, and
said a few words on the amount of his own
means, and what he meant to do for the
younger ones. Nettie was provided for by
her mother's fortune, a smaller proportion
of which would be inherited by the sons
also at their father's death. " But," as
Mr. Lester concluded, *' of course they all
know that in the main they must look to
their own exertions."

'' Of course," said Cheriton.

Alvar looked yere miicli surprised.

*' The boys," he said, 'eyes; but 1
thought, my father, you would wish that
Cheriton should be rich."

"Alvar," said Mr. Lester, rising and
speaking with real dignity, " you misunderstand
me. In such matters I can make
no distinctions between my sons. Cheriton
and his brothers stand exactly on the same
footing. As for you, you will have to represent
the old name, and keep the old
place on its proper level. I shall not stint
you of the means of doing so with ease and
dignity."

Alvar cast down his eyes, and a curious
look as of a sort of oppression passed over
his face.

That will be an obligation to me," he
said, gravely. " You are most  honourable
to me, my father."

'not at all," said Mr. Lester. ** I
should not think of acting otherwise. Well
now you had better be off to Elder-thwart
and settle all. your affairs."

Alvar left the room, and Mr. Lester
burst out, 

I declare, there's something about that
fellow that makes me feel as if I were a
schoolboy ! " Then, a little ashamed of
the admission, he went on, " I like to see
more ardour in a lad when his marriage is
in question. Why, Rupert lived at Elder-thwart,
while he was here ! "

We must make allowance for the difference
of manners," said Cherry. '' Alvar
is very good to me. But, father, I don't
think I shall be strong enough to shoot
this month ; it would be foolish to catch
another cold ; so I thought I should like a
little trip somewhere soon  just a change
before I settle down to work again."

"Wliy, yes," said Mr. Lester; 'concourse
if you wish, though we haven't had
much good of you since you came home,
my boy. Where do you want to go ? "

I don't know  to Paris, perhaps," said
Cherry, on the spur of the moment.
Huntingdon and Donaldson both asked
me to join them this summer ; so I
shouldn't interfere with Alvar. Then,
afterwards I can make all my arrangements
for London."

"Well, yes," said Mr. Lester, reluctantly
; "if you can't shoot, there's no use,
of course, in your going to Milford or
Aspiring."

Jack can go ; it's time lie went about
a little, and he will be a better shot than I
am soon. And when I come back, I'll be
ready for anything."

Cherry's energy was quite natural enough
to deceive his father, especially as he kept
out of sight during this interview; but
when he went away from the study, his
heart suddenly failed him, and he felt as if
he never should have the courage to set
about carrying out the plans on which he
had just been insisting.

CHAPTER XXIII.

MISGIVINGS.
I looked for that which is not, nor can be."

A FEW days before Altar's interview with
his father, Rupert had left Oakby to make
his personal application to Ruth Seyton's
guardians, backed up by a letter from Mr.
Lester, and by her own communication
to her grandmother. Of course, nothing
could be said of the six months of mutual
understanding, and this concealment
weighed lightly enough on Ruth's conscience.
She vexed Virginia by her reserve
on all the details of her engagement,
but what really troubled her was her parting
interview with Rupert, as they were
alone together in the garden at Elder-thwart.


This had once been laid out in the Italian

style, with fountains, statues, and vases,
stiff, neat patris, and little beds cut in the
smooth turf and full of gay colour. Of all
kinds of gardening, this kind can least bear
neglect, and at Elderthwaite a few occasional
turns with the scythe and a sprinkling
of weedy-looking flowers did not suffice
to make it a pleasant resort.

Ruth sat on the pedestal of a broken
nymph by the side of a dried-up fountain.
This garden was supposed to be " kept
up," so some flaring yellow nasturtiums
and other inexpensive flowers filled the
little beds round. It was a dull day, and
the weather was chilly, and Ruth in her
crimson shawl looked by far the most
cheerful object in the garden. Rupert had
stuck some of the nasturtiums in her hat,
and they suited her dark hair and warm,
clear skin. After a great deal of talk,
entirely satisfactory to both, Rupert said,
lightly,

By the way, I thought I would take
Master Cherry to task for his manner to
you the other night."

** Cherry  his manner  what do you
mean ? " stammered Ruth, with changing
colour.

Well, I was rather sorry I had said
anything about it, but he was very frank,
poor boy, and told me you had refused him."

*' I  I did not think you would have
asked him such a question," said Ruth,
hardly knowing what she said in the agony
of fear, relief, and shame.

Oh, well, we're almost like brothers,
you know, and I was not going to have him
make such great eyes at you for nothing.
"What had he to reproach you with ? "

The words were more an exclamation
than a question, but they terrified Ruth,
and she pressed coaxingly up to Rupert,
and said with a good deal of agitation, 

Oh, I am very sorry  very ; but  but
of course I couldn't tell of him  could I ?
And he is so impetuous and so set on his
own way ! But I don't want you to be
angry with him, poor boy, or  or with me,
for, oh ! my darling, we mustn't quarrel
again, or it would kill me ! "

Is lie afraid I shall find out how much
encouragement she gave him ?" said Rupert
in his teasing was.

"Oh! he didn't want much encouragements''
said Ruth. " But there, never
mind, he'll soon forget all about me.
Did you think no one ever liked me but
you?"

Rupert's rejoinder was cut short by
the appearance of Virginia, and Ruth ran
towards her, for once glad to leave Rupert.
She tried to persuade herself that she had
told him no direct falsehood, but the
memory of her two interviews with Cheriton
lay heavy on her soul.

She knew that she had sinned against
her own article of faith, her love for
Rupert ; and her perfect pride and glory in
its perfection was marred. She had fallen
below her own standard; she could no
longer feel that she acted out her own
ideal. Ruth was a girl capable of an
ideal, though she had not set up a lofty
one. Perhaps every one has some standard,
however poor, and the crucial test of

character may be whether we pull it down
to suit our failures, or no. Ruth at this
time was earnestly endeavouring to do so,
but it did not come easy to her, and byway
of set-off she occupied herself with
being exceedingly kind to Virginia, whom
she was beginning to consider injured, and
in whom she recognized an unexpected
warmth of resentment. Not that Virginia
ever uttered a complaint of Alvar, but she
avoided his name in so marked a manner,
and looked so unhappy, that she was self-betrayed.


They were sitting together in the 
on the day of Alvar' s interview
with Mr. Lester. It was a dreary, 
room on that wet, cloudy
day, but Ruth, spite of misgivings, had a
bright prosperous air as she sat writing to
Rupert, curls, ribbons, and ornaments all
in order, the deep red bands on her summer
dress giving it a cheerful air even on a wet
day.

Virginia was sitting in the window doing
nothing; she was pale, and her white

VOL. II. G

dress with its elaborate flouncing had
seen more than one wearing. She did not
look expectant of a lover. Ruth watched
her for a little while, and then said,

slyly.

He cometh not, she said,

She said I am aweary, aweary ;

I would that I were dead !"

Ruth ! how can you ? " exclaimed
Virginia, indignantly. " Who would expect
anybody on such a wet day as this ?
Of course I don't ? "

'' Queenie ! " said Ruth, springing up
and kneeling down beside her, " I don't
like to see you look so miserable. If Don
Alvar is a lukewarm lover, he's not good
enough for my Queenie, and he shan't have
her. There ! "

'' You have no right to say such a
thing, Ruth. I may be silly and foolish,
but I won't hear any one find fault with
him, not even you ! "

Bravo, Queenie ! but I wasn't going
to find fault with him exactly. I daresay
he thinks it is all right enough, only  only
that's not mis idea of a lover ! Grive him

a little pall up, Queenie ; scold him  if sou
can."

Virginia coloured, trembled, and scarcely
refrained from tears.

'' You make me reproach myself, Ruth,"
she said, " for being so silly and exacting.
It ought to please me that Alvar is so good
and kind, and that at last his people have
found him out. It does  "

Look ! " exclaimed Ruth, pointing out
of window. "Who comes there? And
your gown is crumpled, and your necktie
is faded, and you're not fit to be seen !
Run  run and adorn yourself ! "

But Virginia hardly heard her, she was
too eager to see Alvar for any delay, and,
hurrying to the garden-door, she opened
it, while Ruth recollected the awkwardness
of an interview with Alvar and fled.
But he was far too punctilious to come
into the drawing-room with his wet coat,
hat, and umbrella, and he waved his hand
to Virginia and went round to the front
door, where, in the hall, he met Ruth,
and acknowledged her as he passed
G 2

with a stately bow that nearly annihilated
her.

Virginia had meant to be distant and
reproachful, but her resolutions always
melted in Alvar's presence; he was so
delightful to her that she forgot all her
previous vexations. Demonstrative she
never could be to him, but she contrived
to say, 

It is a long time since you were here,
dear Alvar."

Ah, yes," he said, " mi dona, too long
indeed; but we have had people in the
house, and Cherry is not strong enough to
entertain them,"

"How is he?" asked Virginia, feeling,
as she always did, as if rebuked for selfishness.


Pretty well ; this rain is bad for him ;
he may not go out," said Alvar, who did
not wish to represent Cheriton as specially
unwell just then. " But see, mi querida
I have been talking to my father, and he
gives me courage to speak of the future."

And then in the most deferential manner

Alvar unfolded his plans, ending by saying,


** And will you come with me to Seville
that I may show my English bride to my
countrymen, and teach them what flowers
grow in England ? "

I would rather go to Spain than anywhere
else," said Virginia, all misgivings
gone. " I hope they will  like me."

Ah," said Alvar, smiling, " there is
no fear. They would not like those boys
but you  they would worship ! "

Virginia laughed gaily, and he continued
presently, touching the bow on her dress, 

But this ribbon  it is not a pretty
colour. I am rude, but I do not like it."

Oh, Alvar, I am very sorry. Ruth
said I ought to change it. I thought you
would not come, and I didn't care for my
ribbons. I do not care  except when you
see me."

There was a break in her voice as she
looked at Alvar with eyes full of pathetic
appeal for a response to the love she gave
him.

Alvar smiled tenderly.

We will soon cliaoge it," lie said, and,
opening the glass door again, he picked
two crimson roses that climbed over it,
shook the rain-drops carefully from their
petals, and then fastened them into Virginia's
hair and dress. " There ! " he
said, "that is the royal colour, the colour
for my queen. See, I must have a share
of it. Grive me the rosebud."

Virginia stood for a moment with her eyes
cast down. She could have thrown herself
into Alvar' s arms, and poured forth her
feelings with a fervour of expression that
might have startled him, but the doubt and
timidity which she had never lost towards
him restrained her ; she put the rose into
his coat and was happy. The sun came
out through the clouds, they strolled
through the garden together, and Alvar
talked to her about Spain, his stately old
grandfather, his many cousins, and all the
surroundings of his old life.

When he left her at length, and she ran
indoors to Ruth, she was another creature

from the pale, lifeless girl who had watched
the rain-clouds in the morning.

Alvar, too, went home well pleased with
his morning, and ready to make himself
agreeable, and as he came through the
larch wood into the park, he suddenly encountered
the twins.

Nettie was standing with her back to a
tree, a very shabby-looking book under
her arm. She was scarlet, and almost
sobbing with indignation. Bob was opposite
to her, evidently having got the upper
hand in their dispute. He was talking ina
downright decisive voice, and ended
with, 

'' And so I tell you, I won't have it."

'' I don't care."

If you do it again, I'll tell Cherry."

Well, tell him, then ! I'll tell him myself.
He would do just the same, I know
he would."

Then why do you get up in the morning
and go out  ?"

Here Bob caught sight of Alvar and
stopped short.

** What is the matter with you two ?
Whj do you dispute ?" said Alvar, good-naturedly.


*' Nothing," said Bob, shortly; " I was
only talking to Nettie."

"We were only talking," said Nettie;
and they walked away together, with a
manifest determination to exclude Alvar
from a share even in their quarrels. Interfering
between the twins, Cheriton had
once said, was like interfering between
husband and wife ; the peacemaker got the
worst of it.

Apparently Cheriton was experiencing
this truth, for when Alvar came in, he
heard sounds of lively discussion in the
library. His father was speaking inaloud
clear voice, and with his Westmoreland
tones strongly marked, a sure sign that he
was in a passion. Jack was standing very
upright, looking impatient and important.
Cherry sat listening, but with an irritated
movement of the fingers, and a flush of
annoyance on his face. It had been a
rough time lately at Oakby, and Mr. Lester

was just anxious enough about Cheriton to
be ready to find fault with him.

*' No, Cheriton," he was saying, as Alvar
entered, " I'll not hear a word of the kind.
It's a fine result of your influence over the
lads if it's to lead to this sort of mischief.
Warn them ! 1 forbid it positively. You
have made too much of these boys, letting
them write to you at Oxford. Much good
their writing does them, and lending them
books beyond them. No, I'll do my duty
by my tenants in every way  education
and all; but there's a limit."

"But, father," said Cherry, "I can't
make it out. Of course, if Wilson has seen
the young Flemings in the copses, I'm very
sorry ; but anyhow, it would be better to
try to talk to them."

No, I'll not have it done. Wilson has
orders to watch to-night, and if they're
caught, over to Hazelbyby they shall go, and
no begging off for them."

Oh, father," said Cherry, starting up;
do let me go and see them this afternoon.
I haven't been near them since I

was ill, and I'm sure I can find out the
truth of it. It's ruin to a lad to get into a
row with the keepers, and they are capital
fellows. Just let me try."

What is the matter? " asked Alvar.

' Why," said his father, " some young
fellows that Cheriton has a special fancy
for, have been poaching in my copses ! "

"Why, they deserve hanging for it ! "
said Alvar.

Hanging ! " cried Jack. '' The evils
of the Game Laws  "

Oh, nonsense. Jack. Put that in your
Essay on the Evils of all Sorts of Governments,'
" said Cherry; then turning to the
squire, " But they are not poachers,
father."

I will not be interfered with. You
take too much on yourself," said Mr.
Lester; then, seeing Cheriton look first
blankly amazed, then angry, and finally
hurt beyond measure, he suddenly softened.


Well, you can go and see them if you
wish. Don't vex yourself, my lad; you

make too mncli of it. But you're looking
better than you did yesterday."

"Oh, my head ached yesterday," said
Cherry brightly ; but he looked up at his
father with a sudden pang and sense of ingratitude.
Wliy could he care so little for
anything, so little for the Flemings, even
while he argued in their behalf ? He lingered
a little, talking to his father, while
Jack returned to his essay " On the Evils
Inherent in every Existing Form of Government;"
and then set off on his walk to the
Flemings' farm. He ought to care for
lads to whom he had taught their cricket
and their catechism, and who were much
of an age with himself and his brothers,
and often thought to resemble them,
being equally big, fair, and strong. He
talked and sympathized till the story of
certain wrongs was confided to him by
the younger one  how a certain " she "
had nearly driven him to bad courses,
but " she wasn't worth going to the
bad for."

Cherry looked at the lad's serene and

ruddy face, and felt as if he might get a
lesson.

Did all his culture and his principle and
refinement only sap his powers of endurance
?

You're a brave fellow, Willie," he said,
putting out his hand. "I wish  well,
don't let me hear of your getting into
trouble, or going with those poaching
fellows."

No, sir, not for her, nor for any lass.
But  there's the old parson."

Cherry got up from the wall of the field
where he had been sitting, and went to
meet him.

Ha, Cherry, my lad, glad to see you
out again," said Parson Seyton, coming
cheerily oyer the furrows. '* Good-day d'ye,
Willie ; turnips look well."

Young Fleming touched his hat, and
after a word or two, Cheriton asked Mr.
Seyton if he were going Oakby way, as
they might walk together; and, with a
farewell to Fleming, they started down the
hill.

If I hadn't found you here, I should
have been inclined to poach on Ellesmere's
manor, and give young Willie a word of
advice," said Mr. Seyton.

** I know. He has been getting in with
the Ryder s and Fowlers, and my father
heard an exaggerated story about" him and
Ned being seen in our copses at night. I
think that the Flemings are above taking
to poaching ; but Willie has been in a bad
way."

Hope your father '11 catch some of my
fellows ; do 'em good," said the parson.
''If he caught my nephew Dick, and shut
him up for a bit, the place might be all the
better. Hangs about all day, just like his
father. He's after something, and I can't
make out what."

Sometimes I see him about with Bob."

With Bob ? Ha ! you look about you.
Cherry," said the parson, mysteriously.
** My eyes are sharp. I knew when Miss
Ruth and Captain Rupert had their little
meetings; but then, I knew better than
spoil sport."

You knew more than most," said
Clierry.

Ay, and look here. Cherry," said the
parson, stopping and looking full at him.
There's another thing I can see, and that
is, when a man's in earnest and when he
isn't; and when all's smooth and sweet to
a girl, and when she looks this way and
that for something that's wanting."

I have nothing to do with my cousin's
engagement," said Cherry, bewildered.

Nay  nay, it's not your cousin. I
don't believe in foreigners. Cherry ; and
Master Alvar isn't what I call a lover for a
pretty girl that worships the ground he
treads on. If he wants her money, why,
a gentleman should keep up appearances at
least."

Cheriton looked very much affronted.

I don't know if you are aware," he
said, " that my brother's marriage has just
been fixed to take place in October ; he was
at Elderthwaite to-day. And for the rest,
Alvar is very unselfish, and I have taken
up a great deal of his time."

The parson looked at him with an odd sort
of twinkle. " Ay, ay ; I know all about
that," he said ; " but we old fellows know
what we're about. Well, I turn off here ;
so good day to you, and mind my words."

Cheriton walked on, somewhat ruffled
and disturbed. He knew the old parson
would not have spoken as he had without
some reason ; and it crossed his mind that
Bob must be engaged in some undesirable
amusements with Dick; but if so,, what
could he do ? It was instinctive with
Cheriton to try to do something when any
difficulty was brought before him. Unselfish,
loving, and, like all influential people,
fond of influence, he had surrounded himself
by calls on his energies and his interest.
And now these surroundings were
all unchanged, while he was changed
utterly. The relations of son, brother,
neighbour, friend, which he had filled so
thoroughly, remained; and the feelings
due to each seemed to have all died away,
killed by the blow that had come upon
him. He had never lived to himself, nor

realized his life apart from the other lives
ill which it was bound up, or from his
school, his college, and, most of all, his
home ; and now, with this great loss and
pain, he suddenly found that he had a self
behind it all  a self, fearfully strong,
utterly absorbing; all the proportions of
life were changed to him. Nothing seemed
to matter but the chance of rest and
relief. The plans he made had no heart in
them; he felt as if the labour necessary
for success in life was impossible, the success
itself indifferent. His tastes were
pure; the many temptations of life had
been fairly met and conquered by him;
but each one now seemed to look him in
the face from a new point of view, and
with new force. Soul as well as heart is
risked in such an injury as Ruth had done
him, and the more finely balanced perhaps
the more easily overthrown. He did not
cease to resist; but it was chiefly
against the increasing weakness and languor
which were sure in the end to prove
irresistible to him.

CHAPTER XXIV.

A CRISIS.
I will take a year out of my life and story."

One chilly morning, a week or so after
these events, Virginia was sitting in the
drawing-room, with a heap of patterns in
her lap. She was choosing her wedding
gown, and as she laid the glistening bits of
silk and satin on the table before her, she
sighed at the thought that there was no
one to help her, no one to take an interest
in her choice. Ruth was gone, and
Virginia missed her sorely, feeling as if
the loneliness, the uncongeniality of her
home would be intolerable but for the
thought of the release so soon coming.
She felt that, though her little efforts in
the village had had some reward, within
VOL. II. H

doors lie had never felt naturalized, never
been able to produce any impression.
Her father never showed her nearly as
much affection as her uncle did, and she
could not know how much this was owing
to a sense of his own deficiencies towards
her. He was exceedingly irritable, too,
and difficult to deal with, discontented
wholly with life ; while Miss Seyton's sarcastic
tongue always seemed to pierce the
weak places in Virginia's armour, and
when she was inclined to be cheerful, her
talk implied such alien views of life and
duty that she made Virginia wretched.

Dick had been offered some appointment
in London, provided that he could
pass a decent examination next spring,
but his sister could not perceive that he
made much preparation for it. She also
began to suspect that he and Nettie
Lester were more together than was good,
and to wish for an opportunity of hinting
as much to Cheriton, whom she instinctively
felt to be the best depositary of such
a vague suspicion.

But Cheriton was much less well again ;
lie had been obliged to give up going to
Paris, and the whole family were suffering
anxiety on his account, more trying,
perhaps, though less openly acknowledged,
than that caused by his actual illness.
Virginia was not quite the girl to deal
successfully with her home troubles.
Ruth, who did not care a bit whether she
could respect her relations or not, had
made herself more agreeable to them;
while Virginia was timid and miserable,
afraid of being unfilial, and yet perpetually
conscious of defects. Of course, if she
could have felt that Altar had really comprehended
her troubles, they would have
weighed more lightly ; but though his tenderness
always made her forget them fora
time, she never had the sense of taking
counsel with him.

Now, as she turned over her patterns, her
first thought was which he would prefer,
and as her aunt came in and with irresistible
feminine attraction began to examine
them, Virginia said, 
H 2

'' I shall wait till Alvar comes, and ask
him whether he would like me to have silk
or satin."

He will tell you that you look enchanting
in either. That will be a pretty compliment,
and save the trouble of a choice."

'' Oh, no," said Virginia, '' Alvar has a
great deal of taste, and he likes some of
my dresses much better than others. I
wonder if Cherry is better to-day."

'' Probably, as 1 see his most devoted
brother coming up the garden."

Virginia's face flushed into ecstasy in a
moment. She sprang to the garden door,
scattering her patterns on the floor ; while
her aunt looked after her, and muttered
more softly than usual as she left the room,
*poor little thing!"

Alvar looked very grave as he came
towards her, as if he hardly saw the slender
figure in its fluttering delicate dress, or
noticed the eager eyes and smiling lips ;
but, as usual, he smiled when he came up
the steps, and seemed to put aside his
previous thoughts, and to adopt the courteous

manner wliicli made Yirginia feel
herself held at a distance.

For once, lie was more full of her own
affairs than of his. '' Look," she said,
picking up her silks, "do you see these ?
Which do you like best ? "

Alvar twisted the patterns over his
fingers as he stood in the window and did
not at once answer.

'how is Cherry?" she said. "Is he
better to-day?"

Perhaps a little," said Alvar. " But
the doctors have seen him again, and they
say that he must not stay here  that he
must go abroad for all the winter."

Do they ? " said Virginia ; " that looks
very serious*'

Ah yes," said Alvar a little impatiently,
" but my father  they all talk as
if it would kill him to go ; he will get well
away from these bitter winds and  and
the businesses that are too much for
him."

Yes," said Yirginia slowly, perceiving
that Alvar did not quite understand how

startling a sound being ordered abroad
had to English ears after such an illness
as Cheriton's. " What does he say himself
about it? "

'' He dreads it very much; but we will
go to Seville, and then he must find it
pleasant."

Virginia started ; she changed colour,
and her heart began to beat very fast.

'' Mi queries ! " said Alvar, taking her
hand. '' I feel that I  affront you  I do
not know how to ask you to let me go ;
but how can I send my brother away
without me ? For his sake I expose
myself perhaps to blame from your
father "

' I don't quite understand," said Virginia,
withdrawing a little, and speaking
with unusual clearness. '' Did Cherry ask
you to go with him ? "

Ah, no. He refused and said it must
not be. But he told Jack that he hated
the thought of going to Mentone or any
such place alone. My father is too
unhappy about him to be his companion,

and Jack must go to Oxford. So, when I
told him how the wish of my heart was to
show him my Spanish home, he owned
that he should like to see it. The climate
will not cure him if he is dull and miserable."


Certainly you must go with him," said
Virginia steadily, though she felt half
suffocated.

*' Ah, oni reijna I " cried Alvar, his brow
clearing ; *' you see my trouble. Without
your approval 1 could not go ! "

Virginia turned round and fixed her eyes
on Alvar with a look never seen before
under their soft fringes. The sharp
agony of personal loss and disappointment,
the feeling, horrible to the gentle modest
girl, that the loss and the disappointment
reserved all their sting for her, the outward
necessity of the proposal, and the inward
knowledge that Alvar wronged her by his
feeling, though not by his act, drove her to
bay at last. She would have shared in any
sacrifice, but she instinctively knew that
Alvar was making none. The vague dissatisfactions,

the dim misunderstandings,
the unacknowledged jealousies of many
months, all rushed at once into the light.
Her love was too passionate to be patient,
and her self-control broke down at last.

"Yes," she said, "of course you must
go with your brother. I see that. I
admit it quite. But  Alvar  that's not
all. I have seen for a long time that
our engagement was a tie to you  it
was a mistake. I don't blame you 
you did not understand  but it is better
to end it. I release you  you are
free! "

Senorita ! " cried Alvar, flashing up,
I have given no one the right to
doubt my honour. You mistake me."

No," said Virginia, " I do not mistake.
I know  I know you mean rightly  I
ought not to wonder if you don't  if you

don't " she broke off faltering and

trembling, humiliated by the sense that
she had not been able to win him.

But Alvar' s pride had taken fire. " I
am at your service," he said proudly,
since you mistake my request."

I will not hold yon back one day," she
answered. " Nor do I blame you. Don't
mistake me. You laye done all for me
that you could ; but our ideas are different,
and I feel convinced we should only go on
making each other unhappy. It is better
to part."

Since it is your wish to have it so,"
said Altar in a tone of deep offence, but
with a curious pang at his heart. " I was
your true lover, and I would never have
caused you grief. But since I did not
satisfy you, I withdraw. I force myself
on no lady."

Indeed  indeed," faltered Virginia,
*' I do not blame you ; it is perhaps my
fault, that  that we have so often mistaken
each other."

*' It is that to you  as to my father I
am a stranger," said Alvar. '' I will go 
it is as you wish."

He took up his hat, paused, made her a
formal bow, and went out. Virginia
sprang after him; but he did not look
back. She felt herself cruel, exacting,
selfish, and yet she knew that her causes

of complaint were just. She had sent him
away from her, and she would never see
him again. As he passed out of sight,
she ran down the steps, whether after him
or away from the house, she hardly knew.
The trailing overgrown roses caught in her
dress and held her back. She turned, and
all the desolation of the untrimmed garden
and unpainted house seemed to overwhelm
her spirit. The wind came up in long,
dismal rustles, the sky was grey and cold.
As she paused, she saw her aunt's still
graceful figure in its shabby dress cross
the lawn, her face with its fair outline and
hard, bitter look turned towards her.

She lost her lover ! " thought Yirginia,
and her own future flashed upon her like a
dreadful vision. She turned and fled up to
her own room, where every other thought
was destroyed by the sense of loss and
misery. It was in the middle of the
afternoon that she was startled out of
her trance of wretchedness by a call in
her aunt's voice, '' Yirginia, Yirginia !
Come here, I want you particularly."

Virginia obeyed passively. She might
as well tell her aunt of the morning's interview
then as put it off longer. As she
came into the drawing-room, Miss Seyton
left it by another door, and she found herself
alone with Cheriton Lester.

*' Thank yon for coming down," he said,
eagerly. '' I want to explain ; I think there
has been a great mistake."

No, I think not," said Virginia, rather
faintly.

*' But let me tell you. It is all my fault
indeed. Alvar must not be punished for
my selfishness. You know, I got a fresh
cold somehow, and my cough was bad
again, so my father was frightened and
sent for the doctors, and they ordered me
away for the winter. I must not go to
London now, they say  "

Indeed, Cherry, I am very sorry," faltered
Virginia, as the cough stopped him.

Into, but let me tell you. This was a
great shock to me. I want to get to work
and then  my poor father ! It seemed
to knock me down altogether, and foolishly.

I let Jack see it, and said that I bated the
notion of any of those regular invalid
places, and that going there would do meno
good. And then Alvar came and asked
me if I should not like to see his friends
and Seville, and I said, ' Yes, if I must go
anywhere,' and he tried in his kind way to
make the idea seem pleasant to me, and
my father caught at it because he thought
I might like it. I shall never forgive myself
for making such a fuss ! But of
course to-day  now I am in my right
senses  I should not think of such a thing.
If Alvar goes with me, even to Seville, and
stays for a few weeks, then, if I am better,
he can come home, and I shall not mind
staying there alone, and at Christmas Jack
might come to me, or my father  it can
easily be managed. In short, Virginia,"
he added, with an attempt at his usual
playfulness, "I want you to understand
that I made a complete fool of myself
yesterday, and that that's the whole of it."
' Did Alvar ask you to come and tell
me this ? "

"No," said Clieriton, *' lie was hurt by
your misunderstanding him, he does not
know I am here. Jack drove me over.
But I shall not agree to any other arrangement
than what I have told you, unless,"
he added slowly, '' things should go
badly, and then I hioio you would have
patience."

*' Oh, Cherry," said Virginia, struggling
with her tears, " I hope you don't think me
so selfish as to wish to prevent Alvar from
going with you. It is not that.'''

'' But what is it, then ? Can you tell
me ? " said Cherry gently, and sitting down
by her side.

I have no one to ask," she said ; *' but
you will think me wrong, and yet  "

*' I know too well how difficult it is
to be right in matters of feeling, if you
once begin to analyze them," said Cherry
sadly.

The gentleness of his voice and the kind
look of his eyes gave her courage, and she
said, very low, 

'' I think I should not make Alvar happy,

because lie does not care for me. Please
understand that he has done all he could ;
he is very hind to me, but he does not
care for me.'

You know, Ynginia," said Cherry
eagerly, "Alvar has different ways from
ours. Indeed, he is loving  "

He loves you, said Virginia quickly ;
then, blushing scarlet, she added, " oh,
Cherry, I think it is beautiful the way he
is grateful to you, and thinks so much of
you. Please, please, don't think I would
have it otherwise."

I have far more cause to be grateful
to him."

"Yes! I like to think that. But
Cherry, when you were ill, he didn't care
for me to comfort him, it was no rest to
him to come and see me. He never tells
me his troubles. It isn't as Huth and
Rupert love each other. If I say anything,
he turns it aside. It will not make him
unhappy to give me up."

It made him exceedingly angry," said
Cher it on, too clear-sighted not to acquiesce

in the truth of Virginia's words, though he
was unwilling to own as much.

I don't think," said Virginia, " that I
should bear that feeling patiently. Things
are very miserable any way, but I think
Alvar will be happier without me. It has
not turned out well."

She spoke in a low tone of complete
depression, evidently uttering convictions
that had been long formed, gently and
humbly, but with an undercurrent of
firmness.

I will tell Alvar what you say," he
said. " I quite see what you mean, but
perhaps he will be able to show you that
you have misinterpreted him."

No," said Virginia, with decision, " do
not let him try."

As she spoke, there was a tap at the
door, and Jack opened it.

"Cherry," he said, "it is so late; are
you ready?"

One minute, Jack," said Cheriton, " I
am coming. Virginia," he added, taking
her hands in his with sudden earnestness,

"Alvar will love you enough some day.
I am sure of it."

Cheriton hardly knew what put the
words into his mouth ; but they chimed in
Virginia's heart for many a weary day,
lighted up by the bright, brave smile which
had accompanied them.

CHAPTER XXV.

FAREWELL.

near ones, dear ones ! you in whose right hands
Our own rests cain, whose faithful hearts all day,
Wide open, wait till hack from distant lands

Thought, the tired traveller, wends his homeward
way."

*' Of course, since Miss Seyton insists, and
you say you wish it, I come home for my
marriage in October," said Alvar.

'' You don't understand," replied Clieri-
ton vehemently, " and you are unfair to
Virginia. She is as kind as she can be.
Go and show her that you really care for
her as she deserves, and it will all come
right. If anything could make matters
worse for me, it would be to think I had
been the excuse for a break between

you!"

VOL. II. I

Alvar was standing in the library window,
leaning back against the shutter.
He looked perfectly unmoved and impervious
to argument, this mouth shut firm
and his eyebrows a little contracted.
Cheriton, on the other hand, half lying on
the window seat, was flushed and eager as
if he had been pleading for himself, not for
another.

''No," said Alvar obstinately. "Miss
Seyton has dismissed me. She tells me
that I do not content her. "Well, then, I
will go."

Why make yourself wretched for a
mere misunderstanding ? "

I ? I shall not be wretched. I hope
I can take my dismissal from a lady. She
finds that I do not suit her, so I withdraw,"
said Alvar in a tone of indescribable
haughtiness.

Perhaps she knows best," said Cherry,
and is right in thinking you indifferent to
her."

Into  but I will be so soon," said
Alvar coolly.

It is no good to say so," said Cherry ;
then, starting up, he came and pnt his hand
on Altar's arm. " Don't do this thing,"
he said imploringly, " you don't know
what it will cost you."

The two faces clear against the sky were
a contrast for a painter ; Alvar's with its
rich dark colouring, and calm impassive
look just a little sullen, and Cheriton's
delicate, sharpened outlines, the eyes all on
fire and the colour varying with excitement.


Perhaps the two natures sympathized
as little as the faces. Alvar's look softened,
however, as he put Cherry back on
the cushions.

Lie still," he said ; '' why do you care
so much ? You will be as ill as you were
yesterday. If I had known it, you should
not have gone to Elderthwaite."

"But," said Cherry, more quietly, "I
felt sure that there had been a misunderstanding.
It was my fault. Of course I
like best to have you with me ; but I could
not consent to any indefinite putting off of
I 2

your marriage. My father would not agree
to it either. And that is not quite the
point. Show Virginia that she is your first
thought, and everything can be put
right."

Alvar stood silent for a minute, then said
suddenly and emphatically, 

'' 'No. I have not the honour of pleasing
her as I am. I can change for no one.
Do not grieve, Cherito mio, I shall forget
all when I show you Seville, and I will
teach you to forget too. I take the best
of my English home with me when I take
my brother."

He took Cheriton's hands in his as he
spoke, with a gesture, half playful, half
tender. The response was cruelly disappointing.
Cherry withdrew a little and
said, in a tone of extreme coldness, 

'' In that case Virginia is perfectly right.
I quite understand her meaning. But it
will be a great vexation to my father that
your engagement should be broken for such
a cause."

'* My father cannot complain. I have

obeyed him," said Alvar. "But I shall
go and tell him that the proposals he so
honourably made me will be unnecessary'*

He went away as he spoke, and Jack,
who had been listening silently, exclaimed,


By Jove ! he doesn't know what hein
for now?"

Oh," cried Cherry, '' it is intolerable !
If they had married, she would never have
found out his coolness ! It is most unlucky."


"Well," said Jack, "I don't know.
Alvar worships you, and has ways that suit
you, yet you can't understand each other.
Alvar is altogether different from us. He
is outside our planetary system, and always
will be. I'd like my wife to belong to the
same species as myself."

But the occasion is so annoying," said
Cherry. " Whj must they order me off in
this way  or why couldn't I have held my
tongue about it ? Oh, Alvar is the wiseman
after all."

You'll get well," said Jack gruffly.

"Well, ril try. But," lie paused;
but the thought in his mind was that the
home ties had regained their power now
that he believed himself likely to leave them
for ever.

Cherry," said Jack, turning his back,
and hunting in a bookshelf, " I know all
about it."

"Do you, Jack?"

"Yes. You ought to-go away; but do
you mind going alone with Alvar ? Let

me come."

Well, Jack," said Cheriton, after a
pause, " if you know, I can tell you how it
is. I've had a hard time, and I think I
should like to be quiet. But it is right to
give oneself a chance, and as for Alvar, I
am not at all afraid of going alone with
him. You know what a good nurse he is.
If I want you, you will come to me."

Yes," muttered Jack.

But I don't want father to guess at
what the doctors call ' mental anxiety,' nor
to talk hopelessly to him. You must comfort
him. I'm afraid a great deal will be
thrown on you, my boy."

Jack did not answer ; and Cheriton,
divining this feelings, made an effort, and
said cheerfully, 

'' Of course, one is no judge oneself in
such cases. I am quite willing to go now,
and I shall look forward to seeing you at
Christmas. You must write and give me
your impressions of Oxford."

'* Oh yes," said Jack, consoled; "and
perhaps Alvar will pick up a Spanish lady,
and then we should be all right again."

Cherry smiled and shook his head, feeling
that he could not wish to dispose of
Altar in so unceremonious a fashion. He
was angry with him now, and felt how
wide a gulf lay between their points of
view; yet he had grown to be very dependent
on him, and was keenly conscious
of all his unselfish devotion. He saw, too,
that it would not do to talk freely even to
Jack, since it frightened him and made him
miserable, and resolved to keep all his confusing
feelings to himself  feelings that
seemed to tear him to pieces while he was
utterly weary of them all.

He was afraid that he had been hard on

Alvar, and still more afraid of how his
father would take the revelation ; but he
had long to wait before the study door was
flung open, and Alvar walked in, with his
head up, and his face crimson. He was passing
through without heeding his brothers,
but Cherry's call checked him, and he
came up to the window.

Mi queries, this will do you harm," he
said gently; "you excite yourself too much."

But tell me"

Yes, I will tell you. But we will go
upstairs; you must rest."

But as he spoke, his father came out of
the study, and coming up to them, said, ina
tone of strong indignation, 

I wish to know, Cheriton, how long
you have been aware of a state of feeling
on your brother's part which places me ina
situation of which I am thoroughly
ashamed ; whether you were aware that,
as appears from his own confession, my
son has done Miss Seyton the disrespect of
engaging himself to her as a matter of
expediency, and not of affection."

*' Sir," said Alvar firmly, '' your displeasure
is for me alone. I will not allow
my brother to be questioned ; lie is not
strong enough to bear it."

No, Alvar, it won't hurt me. Father,
I don't think you understand. If they
find that they cannot satisfy each other, it
is better to part. Neither would act dishonourably
by the other."

'' There is no use in talking," said Alvar
hotly. " At my father's wish I gave myself
to Miss Seyton as I am. Well, she
rejects me; there is an end of it. lean
change for no one. I am myself. Well,
I do not please any of you, but I do not
ask you to change yourselves, nor will I."

His words sounded like a mere defiance
to his father, but as Cheriton heard them,
he felt their force. Why should they all
expect Alvar to conform to their standard
instead of trying to understand his ?

"Be that as it may," said Mr. Lester,
*' you have found an unworthy pretext. I
am far from ungrateful for all your kindness
to Cheriton, but it was fair on none

of US to take the opportunity of this going
abroad to put off your marriage. If you
had had the manliness to say at once that
your engagement was distasteful to you,
we should have known how to act'*

**I will not stay  I will not hear myself
so insulted ! " cried Alvar, with a sudden
fury of passion, that flared high above his
father's angry displeasure, startling both
the brothers into an attempt to interfere.

Father is mistaken," cried Jack ; while
Cheriton began to say, 

*' Come into the study, father ; I think
I can explain  " when his words were
stopped by a violent fit of coughing.
Agitated and over-fatigued as he was, he
could not check it, and the alarm was
more effectual than any explanations could
have been in silencing the quarrel.

Alvar sprang to his side in a moment,
and sent Jack for remedies ; while Mr
Lester forgot everything but the one great
anxiety and distress. The doctors had
given a strong enough warning against the
possible consequences of such excitement

to make them all feel self-reproachful at
having caused it; and the next words
exchanged between the disputants were an
entreaty from Mr. Lester to know if Alvar
was alarmed, a gentle reassurance on
Alvar's part, and a request, at once complied
with, that his father would move
out of sight, lest Cherry should attempt
to renew the discussion.

It never was renewed. When Cherry
recovered, he was too much exhausted to
try to speak, or to think of Alvar in any
light but of the one who knew best what
was comfortable to him, and once more
everything seemed indifferent to Mr.
Lester beside the approaching parting.
But though a quarrel was averted, there
was much discomfort. Mrs. Lester took
her son's view decidedly, and treated
Alvar like a culprit, the only voice raised
in his favour being Bob's, who observed
unexpectedly '' that he thought Alvar was
quite right to do as he chose." Mr.
Lester had an interview with Mr. Seyton,
and probably made more than the amende

expected from him, for the next day lie
received a note from Virginia : 

'' Dear Me. Lester,  As I find from
my father that you do not entirely understand
the circumstances which have led to
the breach of my engagement, I think it
is due to your son to tell you that it was
entirely my own doing, and that I have no
cause of complaint against him. We
parted, because I believe we are unsuited
to each other, not because he in any way
displeased me ; certainly not because he
very rightly wished to go abroad with
Cheriton. I hope you will forgive me for
saying this, and believe me,

' Yours very sincerely,

"Virginia Seyton."

Well meant as poor Virginia's letter
was, it may be doubted whether it much
enlightened Mr. Lester as to the point in
question ; but he showed it to Alvar, who
read it with a deep blush, and said, 

'' She is, as ever, generous  but  I ama
stranger to her still."

Meanwhile, all the arrangements for the
journey were being made. Clieriton received
a warm invitation from Seville, and
it was agreed, at this earnest request, that
his father should remain behind at Oakby,
but that Jack should go with him to
Southampton, whence they were to go to
Gibraltar by P. and 0. steamer, the easiest
way, it was thought, of making the journey.
In London, Cheriton was to see a
celebrated physician.

He went bravely and considerately
through all the trying leave-takings and arrangements,
taxing his strength to the
uttermost, in the desire to leave nothing
undone for any one. He put aside with a
strong hand, that inner self which yet he
could not conquer, with its passionate
yearning, its bitter disappointment, its
abiding sense of wrong ; but it was there
still, and gave at times the strangest sense
of unreality, even to the pain of the partings,
which was true pain nevertheless
though he seemed to feel it through the
others, rather than through himself. Perhaps

the vehement Lester temperament
was not a very sanguine one, for though
they were told to be hopeful, they were all
full of fear, and Cheriton himself hardly
looked forward to a return, or, indeed, to
anything but possible rest from the strain of
making the best of himself, for he suffered
very much, while all the vivid and appropriate
sensations with which he had once
looked out on life and death had died away.

He could hardly have borne it all but
for Alvar's constant care and watchfulness,
and for the ease given by his apparent
absence of feeling, and for the soothing of
his tender gentle ways, and yet though he
clung to him with ever-increasing gratitude
and affection, there was a curious
sense of being apart from him.

Alvar, though he had too much tact to
fret Cherry by opposition, had no sympathy
with the innumerable interests, for
each one of which he wished to provide,
and thought his parting interviews with
the young Flemings and with many another
waste of strength and spirits. Cherry had

also to go through a trying conversation
with old Parson Seyton, who, between
anger on Virginia's account and grief on
Cheriton's, was difficult to deal with, entirely
refusing to see Altar, and more than
disposed to quarrel with Cherry for going
abroad with him. Even Mr. Ellesmere regarded
Alvar's conduct with considerable
disapproval, though he would not mar his
relations with Cherry by a word.

Alvar said nothing and made no explanations,
but he was exceedingly impatient
of the strain on Cherry's fortitude
and cheerfulness, not seeing what the
memory of this sad time might one day be
to them all, and least of all appreciating
the value of that last Sunday's church-going
and Communion, which, much as it
tried both their feelings and their shy reserve,
not one of the others, even Bob,
would for worlds have omitted. Yet, when
many an old servant and neighbour made
a point that day of following the example
of the squire and his children, Mr. EUes-mere
thought the scene no small testimony

to the value of the lives, which, however
faulty and imperfect, had been led, though
at different levels, with a constant sense of
responsibility towards man and of looking
upwards to Grod. Yes, and as something to
give thanks for, even while his heart swelled
at the thought that the best loved of those
tall fair-faced youths might never kneel in
Oakby Church again.

That same Sunday evening, Mr. Lester
was sitting alone in the library in the dusk,
sad enough at heart, when Cherry came
slowly in behind him, and leaned over
the back of his chair.

Father," he said, "I've been thinking,
and I want to tell you something before I go."

"What is it, my boy?  don't stand 
here, sit here."

He pulled another chair towards his
own as he spoke, and Cherry sat down,
and said, 

'' Father, I think I had rather you knew
as much as I ought to tell you; I don't
want to have any secret between us."

'well, my boy?"

And, besides, I heard yon say that, if
yon could have found any reason for my
being worse, yon would be less anxious
about me. Well, it is not a reason exactly,
bnt I suppose it made me careless. I  IVe
had a great trouble lately  a  a disappointment.
It's over now  but it cost mea
good deal at the time. I can't tell you
any more about it ; but I thought  after
all  I had rather you knew  now ! "

Mr. Lester did not ask a single question.


'' I never guessed this," he said, in a
tone of surprise ; then, after a pause,
Well, my dear boy, it's a great relief to
my mind."

Cherry nearly laughed, though his heart
was full enough.

"You need never imagine that it will
turn up again," he said, decidedly.

Ah, well. Cherry, we've all had disappointments,"
said Mr. Lester, more cheerfully
than he had spoken for some time ;
*' and I'm glad there's something to account
for your looks lately. You weren't strong

VOL. II. K

enougH for vexations. You'll shake them
off with the change of scene. But, my
lad, don't go and make a fool of yourself
in the reaction."

Cherry was sufficiently acquainted with
his father's history to guess at the drift of
this warning; but he only shookhis head and
smiled, and then there was a long silence.
Cherry leaned against the arm of his father's
chair, and, after a long-forgotten childish
fashion, began to finger the seals on his
watch-chain.

These are the first things I remember,"
he said.

Mr. Lester passed his arm round him, as
when he had been a slim boy, standing by
his side ; and though no other word was
spoken, and in the darkness there were
tears on both their faces, Cherry felt that
after such a drawing together, this worst of
all the partings was easier to bear.

CHAPTER Xxii.

FIGHTING THE Deacon.

Does the road wind uphill all the way 1
Yes, to the very end."

** So, papa, here we are, off at last ! I can
hardly believe it, and nothing left behind !
Isn't it delightful ? Such lovely weather
and so many people ! I wish we were
going to India right away ! I wonder
how many of those people are good
sailors."

A very small proportion, my dear, in
all probability."

How I do like to look at people and
imagine histories for them ! And yon cannot
start for India without a sort of story ;
can you ? As for you and me, were just
going to enjoy ourselves ! "

The speaker looked capable of enjoying

herself and all around her. She was a girl
of eighteen or nineteen, dressed in a
tightly-fitting dark blue dress with a little
black felt hat, very becoming to her small,
slender shape, and dark glowing complexion.
She had pretty features and very
white teeth, which showed a little in her frequent
smiles ; dark hazel eyes, bright, clear,
and penetrating ; and curly wavy hair, as
black as an English girl's can be. She
had quick, decided movements, a clear, firm
voice, and the sweetest laugh possible.

Among all the anxious, hurried, fidgety
people on the deck she looked perfectly
happy and at her ease  not careless, fora
variety of small packages were neatly piled
up beside her, but entirely content ; for was
not the desire of her heart in process of fulfilment?
Ever since Elizabeth Stanford,
always appropriately called Gipsy, had
been a little girl, she had delighted in
sharing her father's expeditions when the
great London artist sought new ideas, new
models, or a cessation from ideas and
models, in the enjoyment of natural beauty.

These expeditions had not hitherto been
long or frequent, for Gipsy was the eldest
of seven, and holiday trips away from the
old house at Kensington were generally
made in company with her mother and the
children, with occasional divergences of
Mr. Stanford's. Gipsy, too, was but newly
released from the thraldom of lessons and
classes, though a week once at the Lakes,
and another in Cornwall, had shown
Mr. Stanford that she possessed various
requisites for a good traveller  a great
capacity for enjoyment and a great incapacity
for being bored, good health, a
good appetite, and a good temper.

Therefore, when a long-cherished wish of
Mr. Stanford's own was put in practice,
and he set out for a three months' tour in
search of the picturesque in Southern Spain,
he took Gipsy with him, and this warm,
sunshiny September morning found them
on the deck of a P. and 0. steamer, just
about to leave Southampton on its way to
Gibraltar.

They had arrived on board early, and

were now watching the approach of their
fellow-passengers, the farewells and last
words passing between them and their
friends : Gripsy simply delighted with the
novelty of the scene, and her father watching
it with a peculiarly acute and kindly
gaze of accurate observation.

Mr. Stanford, with his slender figure
and dark beard, looked young enough to
be sometimes mistaken for his daughter's
elder brother ; she resembled him in colouring
and feature, but keen and sweet as her
bright eyes were, they had not looked out
long enough on life to have acquired the
thoughtful sympathetic expression that
gave to her father's face an unusual charm
a look that seemed to tell of an insight
that reached beyond the artist's observation
of form and colour, or even of obvious
character, and penetrated the very thoughts
of the heart, not merely to note but to
understand them. Perhaps this was why
Mr. Stanford' s portraits were thought such
good likenesses, and why his original
designs never wanted for character and
expression.

He was not thinking purposely of anything
but his hoHclay and his daughter, but
the blue sky and bright sunshine of this
unusually summer-like September helped
his sense of enjoyment, and every face as
it passed before him interested . or amused
him from the bright, fresh-faced schoolgirl
just " finished," and looking forward
through a few parting tears to incalculable
possibilities in her unknown life, to the
climate-worn official who had been bored
during his leave at home, yet was far from
regarding India as a paradise. Brides
blushing and smiling, mothers with eyes
and hearts sad for the children left at
home, young lads with the world before
them  the deck offered specimens of all
these. Some were surrounded by groups
of friends, but most of the sadder partings
had been got over elsewhere, and the
passengers were coming on board with a
sense of relief, and minds chiefly full of
their luggage and their state-rooms, their
places at the table, and their chairs for the
deck.

As Mr. Stanford's eye travelled over

the various groups he observed two young
men sitting close together on one of the
benches at a little distance. The one
nearest to him sat with his face turned
away towards his companion, a tall, powerful
lad, with fair hair, and features of an
unusually fine and regular type, now pale
and half sullen with a pain evidently
almost beyond endurance. The other's
hand lay on his knee, and he seemed to bespeaking,
for the boy nodded and murmured
a word or two occasionally. " That's
a bad parting," thought the artist ; "I
wonder which is the traveller."

Look, papa," said Gipsy, " there's a
model for you ! Isn't that an uncommon
face ? " She pointed out to him a tall, dark
young man, with a peculiar oval face of
olive tinting, who stood close to them
making inquiries of some officials.
There's a distinguished foreigner for
you," she said.

"Yes, a foreigner of course ; a very fine
fellow."

Something restrained the kindly-natured

artist from drawing his daughter's attention
to the parting moments that were evidently
so painful ; but the '' distinguished foreigner,"
as the last minutes approached, drew
near to the pair and touched the lad on the
shoulder. He started up ; the other rose
also and turned round, showing a face like
enough in type to suggest the closest kinship,
but white, thin, telling a tale of sickness
as well as of present suffering. They
grasped each other's hands. Mr. Stanford
involuntarily turned his eyes away, and in a
moment the lad pushed through the crowd,
evidently unseeing and unheeding, passed
close by them and knocked over all Gripsy's
bags, shawls, and bundles, pushed on, never
knowing what he had done, and turning,
gave one last look at his brother, who met
it with a beaming, resolute smile, and a
wave of the hand.

The oh ve-faced foreigner who had followed,
saw the accident, and made a gesture
of apology, then bid the boy farewell
with clasped hands and some rapidly-uttered
sentences, watching him over the side, and.

comme back to the Stanfortlis, hastily replaced
the fallen articles.

Pardon'* he said, '' my brother could
not see."

"Don't mention it; no harm done,"
said Mr. Stanford kindly, as the young
man moved away, other groups came up
and separated them, and he was seen no
more till dinner time, when he appeared,
but without his companion.

In the intervals of making acquaintance
with her fellow passengers and of beginning
the letter which was to tell her mother of
every event of their tour, Gripsy Stanford
speculated as to how the " distinguished
foreigner " came to call such an unmistakable
Englishman his brother.

The three days that the Lesters had
spent in London had been trying and
fatiguing. Judge Oheriton and his wife
had come up from the country to their townhouse
on purpose to receive them, but the
very kindness and interest which had
prompted them to inquire into all the
causes of Cheriton's illness, and to question

the prudence of some of the home measures
had fretted both Oheriton and Jack, the
latter being a little disposed to resent any
interference. But the right of the Cherish
to a share in their nephews' affairs
had always been admitted, and Mr. Lester,
little as he felt himself able to bear the
further strain, would hardly have let them
go to London without him, but for his
brother-in-law's assurance that they should
not start till every arrangement had been
made. The judge was surprised at the
confidence reposed in Alvar, and though
he had too much sense to try to shake it,
had caused Mr. Lester to insist that they
should be accompanied by a servant experienced
in travelling and in illness,
instead of the Oakby lad at first chosen 
an arrangement which Cheriton secretly
much disliked, though he acquiesced in it
as sparing his father anxiety.

Judge Cheriton also undertook to give
Mr. Lester a full report of the physician's
opinion, which was not, on the whole, discouraging.
He said that though the illness

had left manifest .traces, and that he considered
Cheriton in a critical state, there
was nothing to prevent entire recovery, of
which the winter abroad offered the best
chance ; and if he wished to go to Southern
Spain, Spain it might be, as rest and change
were as much needed as climate. There
was no use in thinking of any profession
or occupation till the next summer. Some
overstrain had resulted in a complete
break-down, and the cough was part of the
mischief. Fatigue, cold, and anxiety were
all equally to be avoided, but as there was
no predisposition to any form of chest
disease in the family, they might look forward
hopefully.

This verdict entirely consoled Alvar,
who, indeed, had never looked much beyond
the present, and brightened the anxious
hearts at Oakby, especially when accompanied
by a note from Cherry himself,
which he had made Jack read to " see if it
was cheerful enough."

He and Jack clung to each other closely
during those last few days, and till they

parted, Cheriton never ceased to be the
one to uphold and to cheer ; but when Jack
was out of sight, he broke down utterly,
and while Alvar was beginning to make
acquaintance with the Stans oaths, Cheriton
lay fighting hard with all the suffering
which he had so long held at bay. He
was not passive, though Alvar thought
him so, as he lay still and silent, unwilling
to speak or be spoken to. He was
struggling actively, strenuously, with all
the force of a strong will against a passionate
and rebellious nature. He was sufficiently
experienced in self-control, and unselfish
enough to have succeeded in behaving welland
courageously under his various troubles.
But Cherry's notions of self-conquest aimed
higher and went deeper. He would be
master of his own inmost soul, as well as
of his outward actions. His eyes were pure
enough to see as in a vision what was implied
in saying honestly, " Thy Will be
done," and clear enough to know that he
could not say it ; while, on the other hand,
there was scarcely any form of wrath and

bitterness to which memory did not tempt
him. Why must he suffer in so many
ways ? Perhaps the moments of softer
yearning for the lost love of his boyhood,
sad as they were, were the least painful
part of his suffering. The loss of health
and strength, and of the power of substituting
some other aim in life for those
earlier and sweeter hopes, came as a separate,
but to so active a person, an exceeding
trial, while he was separated from all
the lesser interests which had the power
of custom over him, a power in his case
unusually strong ; yet in these he felt lay
the hope of salvation, at least from those
intermittent waves of utter despondency
which made all alike worthless and blank.
Cheriton had all his life tried to choose
the better part, to follow his own higher
nature, and seek what was lovely and of
good report, had all his life looked upward.
Had he not done so, these present
temptations would have attacked him on a
far lower level, or, set apart as he was just
now from all outward action, he would

more probably not have recognized that
lie had a battle to fight at all. But to
Cheriton it was given to see the issues
of the battle that has been fought by all
true saints, and perhaps by some sinners ;
and his chief mistake now was that he was
young enough to think that, like the typical
dragon fights of the old world, it could be
won by one great struggle. This was his
inner life, of which no one knew anything,
save perhaps Jack, who was like-minded
enough to guess something of it.

Alvar only saw that he was weak and
weary, and suffering from a great reaction
of mind and body. He was a very judicious
companion, however, and after a day
or two of repose succeeded in coaxing
Cherry on to the deck; where the fresh
air sent him to sleep on the cushions that
Alvar had arranged for him, more quietly
than for some time past.

When he opened his eyes, and began
to look about him, it was with a refreshing
sense of Uf e and circumstances apart from
himself and his perplexities. The blue sky,

VOL. II. L

the dancing waves, the groups of people
moving about, the unfamiliar sights and
sounds amused him. He looked round
for his brother, and presently discovered
him sitting at a little distance, smoking his
unfailing cigarette, and looking both comfortable
and picturesque in the soft felt
hat, which, though not especially unlike
other people's, always had on him the
effect of a costume. He was talking to
a young lady, with an air of considerable
animation and intimacy. She was knitting
a gay-striped sock, the bright pins twinkling
with the rapid movement of her
fingers, and she laughed often, a particularly
gay, musical laugh.

Alvar glanced round, and seeing that
Cherry was awake, sprang up and came
over to him.

'' Ah, you have had quite a long sleep,"
he said.

Have I ? I feel all the better for it.
This is very comfortable. And pray who
is the young lady with the knitting-needles
? "

Why, that is Miss Stanford. Did I
not tell you how kind they have been ?
You see, Jack nearly knocked her down,
and so we made acquaintance; and just
now I was teaching her some Spanish."

Did Jack create a favourable impression
by that mode of introduction ? "

Why, yes," said Alvar, delighted at
hearing the shadow of a joke from Cherry ;
for I explained how it was that he was
in trouble, and they were interested at
hearing of you. Now you must have some
breakfast, and then perhaps you would
like to see them."

'' Oh, no," said Cherry, " I don't feel upto
talking ; but I am glad you have someone
to amuse you."

However, Cherry began to be amused
himself by watching this brother. He felt
the relief of having nothing to do and no
one to think of, and as he lay looking on,
was surprised at perceiving how sociable
the stiff, reserved Alvar appeared to be,
how many little politeness he performed,
and how gay and light-hearted he looked.
L 2

Evidently Mr. and Miss Stanford were
the most attractive party, tliougli Alvar
seemed on speaking terms with every one ;
and at last Cherry, seeing that he wished
it, begged that Mr. Stanford would
come and speak to him, and their new
acquaintance, having the tact to see that
he was shy in his character of invalid,
came and sat down beside him, and talked
cheerfully on indifferent topics.

And where are you bound for," he
asked presently, " when you reach Gibraltar?"


'Tor Seville," said Cheriton; "Don
Gruzman de la Rosa, my brother's grandfather,
lives there at this time of the
year. He has a country place, too, I believe,
for the summer. But Alvar thinks
the journey would be too much for me
yet. I hope not ; he must want to be with
his friends."

"My daughter and I," said Mr. Stan-forth,
" have some friends at Gibraltar,
and they have recommended us to join
them at a place on the coast, San Jose, I

think they called it. Afterwards our
dream has been to spend some weeks at
Seville. Can you tell us anything of ways
and means there, for we are trusting
entirely to fate and a guide-book ? "

I'm afraid," said Cherry, smiling,
that I am trusting with equally implicit
faith in Alvar. I haven't asked many
questions. Alvar, can you tell Mr. Stan-forth
what he must do, and how he must
manage in Seville ? "

All I know is at his service," said
Alvar, sitting down at Cherry's feet ;
but he will, I hope, visit my grandfather,
who will be honoured by his coming. My
aunt, too, and my cousins would be proud
to show Miss Stanford Seville."

"Oh, papa," exclaimed Gipsy impetuously,
catching these words as she approached,
" to know some Spaniards.
Then we should really see the country."

She broke off, blushing; and Alvar,
springing up, offered her a seat, and introduced
her to his brother, while Mr.
Stanford said, 

Thank you, we could not refuse such
a kind offer ; but I want to make Seville
my head quarters, and make excursions
from thence. What sort of inns have
you ? Are they pleasant for ladies ? "

Papa, you know we settled that I was
not going to be a lady."

Did we, my dear ? I was not a party
to that arrangement. You are not quite
a gipsy yet, you know."

'' There are inns," said Alvar, " but the
best plan is to take a flat in what we calla
' Casa de pupils,' a pension, I suppose.
I know one. Dona Catalina, who keeps
it, is an excellent lady, most devout, and
she once received an English family, so
she knows better how you like to eat and
drink."

I don't mean to eat and drink anything
that is not Spanish," said Gipsy, laughing.

Indeed," said Alvar, ** you will not
often find anything that is English. I
sometimes fear that my brother will not
like that."

*' You have a lively remembrance of being

asked to eat oat-cake and porridge, and
drink what we call sherry," said Cheriton.

But I will not expect that you shall
like things that are strange to you, querido,'
said Alvar, a speech that revealed a little
of the family history to Mr. Stan forth' s
sharp eyes ; while Gripsy said earnestly, 

Oh, the strangeness is what I expect
to enjoy."

A good deal more information of different
kinds followed, and Cherry wondered
at this own ignorance of Alvar' s former
surroundings.

* Why, I did not know that your
cousins lived with you," he said.

I did not speak much of Seville to
you'' said Alvar, with ever so slight an
emphasis, the first reminder he had ever
given that there had been one to whom
he could talk freely.

'' We were all too much occupied with
teaching you about Westmoreland, and
lately I think I have been too stupid to
care. But you must give me some
Spanish lessons soon."

Have you been long in England ? "
said Mr. Stanford to Alvar.

I came at Christina. Ah, how cold
it was ! The boys and Nettie laughed at
me because I did not like it. They ran out
into the snow without their hats that I
might feel ashamed of sitting by the fire,"
said Alvar quaintly.

'' Ah, we were a set of terrible young
Philistines ! " said Cheriton. " Do you remember
the snow man and the wrestling ?"

I wish you could wrestle with me
now, my brother," said Alvar affectionately.

That must be the effect of Spanish
sunshine, instead of Westmoreland snow;
and in the meantime we must not tire
you with talking," said Mr. Stanford,
perceiving that Cherry hardly liked the
allusion. " Come, Gipsy, isn't it time for
one of the innumerable meals we have onboard
ship ? "

Oh, papa, I am sure you are always
ready for them," said Gipsy, following him.

Mr. Stanford, on discovering more
clearly the whereabouts of Oakby, recollected

liaviiig visited Ashrigg some years
ago, when engaged on a portrait of some
member of Sir John Hubbard's family.
He perceived with some amusement that
Alvar attached no ideas to his name or to
his profession ; and Cherry had scarcely
realized either, so that when the next
morning Mr. Stanford came up to speak
to him, with a sketch-book in his hand, he
said, quite simply, 

I see you have been drawing ; may I
look?"

If you will not think I have taken a
great liberty," said Mr. Stanford, giving
him the book.

Cheriton laughed and exclaimed at one
or two exquisitely outlined likenesses of
their fellow-passengers, hitting off their
peculiarities with a touch, then admired a
little bit of blue sky and dancing wave,
with a pair of sea-gulls hanging white and
soft in the midst, while under were written
the lines, 

As though life's only call and care
Were graceful motion."

"How lovely!" he said; '' low wonderfully
well you do it ! Ah, that is
Alvar  yes, you have caught that grave,
graceful look exactly. Alvar is just like a
walking picture ; he can't be awkward."

'' I am afraid I have not been so successful
with Alvar' s brother ; but the contrast
was irresistible," said Mr. Stanford,
as Cherry turned another page, and saw a
sketch of himself lying on the deck, and
Alvar, leaning over him, and pointing out
something in the distance.

That is just Alvar's look."

You are a much more difficult subject
than your brother," said Mr. Stanford.

'' I? I don't think I'm fit to sit for my
picture. We tried in London to get a
photograph taken ; but it made me look
worse than I am, so we did not send it
home."

You must let me try again. As an
artist I may be forgiven for rejoicing in
the chance of studying such a likeness beneath
such a contrast as there is between
you two. See, your faces are in the same

mould ; it is the colour, and still more the
character, that differs."

I think that may be true of more than
our faces," said Cherry thoughtfully ;
but I see what you mean, at least when
I think of Jack, and we were alike when I
was well. I will show you."

Here Cheriton caught sight of the name
on the first page of the book, " Raymond
Stanford," looked at the drawings, and
then at his new friend's face with a rush
of comprehension.

How stupid I have been ! " he exclaimed,
colouring. '' I beg your pardon.
Of course I ought to have guessed who it
was at once. Pray don't think I am so
ignorant as not to know your pictures.
And I have been presuming to praise your
sketches."

Mr. Stanford laughed kindly.

'' You must not leave oE doing so now
we have found each other out. Don't
imagine that appreciation is not always
pleasant."

*' You have a great many admirers at

Oxford," said Cheriton, a little stiffly and
shyly. " Some of the fellows prided themselves
immensely on their appreciation of
all sorts of modern art ; but I'm afraid I
don't know very much about it."

You employed your time, your brother
tells me, to better purpose ? "

'' I don't know. I thought so then,
jnd it seemed more worth while to get a
ride or pull on the river. I don't see what
a fellow wants in his room but an armchair
and a place for his books, and a good
fire. One had better be out of doors when
one isn't working. I don't care to have
my rooms like a lady's drawing-room. But
of course," he added apologetically, " 1
always like to go to the Academy and seethe
pictures."

Mr. Stanford looked very much amused,
but he was interested too. It is not uncommon
in youth that considerable powers
of mind may be exercised so entirely in one
line, as to leave many fields of intelligence
completely blank, and there were many
points on which Cheriton simply accepted

the code of his home, which, put into plain
language, was, that study was study, and
recreation out-of-door exercise of different
kinds, intellectual amusements being regarded
with suspicion. But there was
much more than the boyish " Philistinism "
of this last speech written on the face of
the speaker, and Mr. Stans orth felt inclined
to draw it out.

What did you say you were going to
show me ? " he said.

'* I wanted you to see the rest of us ! "
said Cherry. " Where is Alvar ? He
would get my photograph case."

Alvar was near at hand, talking to Gipsy
Stanford and to some other ladies, and he
soon brought Cheriton a little leather case
which contained a long row of handsome
Lester s, and ended with the favourite dogs
and horses, and a view of the front door at
Oakby, with Nettie holding Buffer on the
back of one of the stone wolves.

There is a ready-made picture," said
Mr. Stanford.

*' My brother loves that little animal,"

said Alvar smiling, '' lie would like his
picture better than that of any of us."

'' I am sure some of our dogs are worth
painting," said Cherry, "but Alvar does
not appreciate Buffer's style."

And so, brightened by the fresh companionship
and new scenes, the days slipped
by, till Cheriton wished their sameness
could continue for ever.

CHAPTER XXVII.

SAN JOSE.

The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,
Rests like a shadow, and the cicala sleeps,
The purple flowers droop."

At Gribraltar the new acquaintances parted,
and Mr. Stanford and his daughter went
at once to join their friends at San Jose,
with many hopes expressed of soon meeting
at Seville ; whither Cheriton, unwilling
to detain Alvar from his friends, wished to'
go immediately. Mr. Stanford' s holiday
was not an idle one. Every walk he took,
every change of light and shade was a feast
of new colour and form for him, to be perpetuated
by sketches more or less elaborate,
and the enjoyment of which was intense.
But the pair of dissimilar brothers
had afforded him interest of another kind,
and it was with real pleasure that he

thought of a renewal of the intercourse
with them, which came about sooner than
he had expected.

His friends, the Weston, were a brother
and two sisters, lively people approaching
middle age. Mr. Weston had a government
appointment in Gribraltar, and his
sisters lived with him. They were enterprising,
cultivated women, and very fond
of Gripsy Stanford; who possessed that
power of quick sympathetic interest which
of all things makes a delightful companion.
She was always finding " bits " and
"effects" for her father, or suggesting
subjects for his pencil ; and she was almost
equally pleased to hunt for flowers for
the botanical Miss Weston, and to lookout
words in the dictionary for the literary
one, who was translating a set of
Spanish tales.

A propos of these, she related with
much interest their acquaintance on board
ship, describing the two Lesters with a
naivete that amused her friends, and
prompted Miss Weston to say, 

You seem to have been very fortunate
in your travelling companions,
Gipsy."

Yes, we were. And it will be such
an advantage to know a native family at
Seville. That sounds as if they were

heathens ; but 1 declare that is Don

Alvar, buying oranges ! Oh, I am so glad
to see you ! So you have come hereafter
all."

Yes. Cheriton was so ill at Gribraltar
that it was plain that he could not bear
the journey to Seville. It is cooler here,
and he is a little better; but he can do
nothing yet, and I am very unhappy. I
do not know what to write to my father
about him."

Oh, I am sorry," said Gipsy warmly.
He seemed better on board. And this
place is so lovely."

*' Yes," said Alvar simply. " I could
feel as if I was in heaven in the sunshine,
and when I hear the voices of my
home ; but when he suffers, it darkens all.
But I must go back to him."

VOL. II. M

'papa will come and see you," said
Gipsy ; " and this is Miss Weston, with
whom we are staying. Good-bye. I
think your brother will be better when he
has had a rest."

Gripsy's cheerful sympathy brightened
Alvar, who had expected that Spanish
sunshine would make a miraculous cure ;
but Cherry's cough had been worse since
they came on shore, and his spirits had
failed unaccountably just when Alvar had
expected him to recover them.

Alvar had all along declared that it would
be better to go by a Cadiz packet and
thence by rail to Seville ; but Mr. Lester believed
in Peninsular and Oriental steamers,
and in the English doctors and hotels of
Gibraltar. But there the heat and glare
were hateful to Cheriton, the servant they
had brought proved more of a hindrance
than a help, and Alvar thought himself
fortunate in obtaining leave from some
Gribraltar acquaintances to use their house
at San Jose for a month, after which Cheriton
might be better able to encounter the

strangers whom lie really dreaded more
than the travelling. Certainly if change
was what Cherry had needed he had obtained
it thoroughly. Nothing could well
have been more unlike Oakby than San
Jose, and when Cheriton had had a little
rest, had been teased by Mr. Stanford for
comparing the marble-paved jpatio of the
house to the Alhambra at the Crystal
Palace, and, moved by the fortunate sympathy
that had enabled him to " take a
fancy " to the kindly artist, had confided
to him that he was very homesick, and
longed for Jack, though he did not like
Alvar to know it, he brightened up and
grew rather stronger. He was soon able to
sit on the beach and try to learn Spanish,
insisting on understanding the construction
of the language, and asking questions
sometimes rather puzzling to his tutor;
while Gipsy set up a rivalry with him as
to the number of words and phrases to be
acquired in a day, in which she generally
beat him hollow. Nor had he any real
want of appreciation of the new and beauty
2

fill world around him, and Mr. Stanford
helped him to enjoy it. Life would be
very dull but for the involuntary inclinations
to acquaintance and friendship that
brighten its ordinary course, and "fancies "
are more often things to be thankful for
than to put aside. This one roused Cheriton
from the dulness that accompanies
sorrow and sickness, and enabled him to
turn at any rate the surface of his mind
to fresh interests.

Mr. Stanford, on the other hand, whose
sympathy had been quickened by the
practice of a most kindly life, found much
to interest him in the bright, tender nature,
evidently struggling under so heavy a
cloud, and did not wonder at the affection
with which the young man was obviously
regarded  an affection made pathetic by
the sad possibilities that were but too apparent.


Gipsy was on very friendly terms with
both the brothers, and was a new specimen
of girlhood for them. She was quite
as clever and as well educated as either

Hath or Virginia, and had been in the
habit of living with much more widely
cultivated people  people who talked, and
had something to talk about, so that she
had a great deal to say ; while there was
a quaint matter-of-factness about her too,
and she talked art as simply as she would
have talked dress ; and while she was very
much interested in the two young men,
she never troubled herself at all about
her relations towards them. She scolded
Cherry for walking too far, and discoursed
on the suitability of his appearance for
artistic purposes with equal simplicity;
fetched and carried for him, and triumphed
over his deficiencies in Spanish. She received
Alvar's courtesies and compliments
with the greatest delight, and proceeded to
return them in kind, till she actually rendered
him almost free and easy, and he
talked so much of her that Cheriton grew
half-frightened, unknowing that his own
remark, that he wished Nettie could know
so nice a girl as Miss Stanford, had inspired
Alvar with the notion that Ruth

might find a successor in La Niagara, as
lie called her. But Gipsy was perfectly
unconscious, and was moreover carefully
watched over by lier father and her friends.
By the end of the month Cheriton was
able to undertake the journey to Seville,
and the Stanforths proposed to start at
the same time, but to go by a different
route, which enabled them to see more of
the country.

But," said Gripsy, one evening when
they were all together on the beach, *' we
must get to Seville in time for a bull-fight,
and Don Alvar says there are none in the
winter."

*but, Miss Stanford," said Cherry,
 you surely would not go to a bull-fight?"

"Wouldn't you?" said Gipsy mischievously.


Well, yes  for once I think I should."

"You would not like it, Cherito," said
Alvar.

Don't you ? " echoed Cherry, with a
glance at Gipsy.

Oh, yes ; it is grand ! When the

bull makes a rush one holds the breath,
and then  it is a shout ! "

'' I suppose it is a wonderful spectacle,"
said Mr. Stanford. *' I hope to have a
chance, but I think Gipsy will have to take
it on trust."

*' Jack desired me not to encourage
them," said Cherry, '' but I must own to
a great curiosity about it."

'' But I shall not let you go," said Alvar ;
'rit would tire you far too much; and
besides you are too tender-hearted. My
brothers," he added to Mr. Stanford, 'cannot
bear to see anything hurt, unless they
hurt it themselves; then they do not mind."

'' Of course," said Cherry, "there is an
essential difference between incurring
danger, or at least fatigue and exertion
yourself, and sitting by to see other people
incur it. I have no doubt it is a barbarous
sort of thing, and there is something dreadful
in the idea of a lady being present at
it ; but it would be stupid, I think, to come
away without seeing anything so characteristic."


*' The Spanisli ladies do not mind it, nor
I," said Alvar, " any more than you mind
kilHng sour foxes, or your fish ; but it is
different for foreigners. They do not Hke
to see the horses, though they are mostly
worthless ones, torn in pieces. You would
be ill, queries, you might faint."

*' Nonsense," said Cherry. '' I might
hate it, but I should not be so soft as that."

"You do not know," said Alvar, evidently
not disposed to yield. " Some
day," with a glance at Gipsy, " I will tell
you. You shot the old horse yourself for
fear the coachman should hurt him  but
it made you cry ; and if a dog whines it
grieves you."

Old Star that I learnt to ride on ! " said
Cherry indignantly. '' What has that todo
with it?"

'rand besides," resumed Alvar, perhaps
a little wickedly, " bull fights are usually
on Sunday, and are quite as bad as billiards
or the guitar, which you say in England
are vnong.*'

These are frightful imputations on you,

Cheriton," said Mr. Stanford : ''a tender
heart and too strict a sense of duty. No
wonder you are obstinate. But if what I
have read be true, a bull-fight is a hard
pull on our insular nerves sometimes, and
I doubt if you are in condition for one."

*' I don't want to see a bull-ring at
Oakby," said Cherry ; " but Alvar is mistaken
if he thinks I should mind it more
than other people do. There is enough of
a sporting element, I suppose, to keep one
from dwelling on the details."

'' I see, Mr. Lester," said Gipsy, " that
you don't believe in the rights of women."

No, Miss Stanford, I certainly don't.
I believe in my right to protect them from
what is unpleasant."

"But not to give them their own way I
Papa, don't look at me like that. I don't
want to go and see horses killed on a Sunday,
if Mr. Lester does. But a bull-fight
the national sport of Spain  and the
matadors who are so courageous  ah ! it
makes such a difference the way things are
put."

You must learn to look at the essentials,
my dear. But now shall we have a
last stroll to the point to see the sunset?"


You need not tell Granny if I do go to
the bull-fight," whispered Cherry, as Alvar
helped him up, and gave him his arm across
the rough shingles.

CHAPTER Xxviii.

SEVILLE.
Golden fruit fresh plucked and ripe."

And now, my brother, jon see Seville.
At last I can show you my beautiful city ! "

Why  why, you never said it was like
this ! "

The Lesters had finally settled to go to
Cadiz by sea, and thence by rail to Seville,
again breaking their journey at Xeres.
The Stanforths were making the journey
across country ; but Cheriton was not equal
to long days on horseback, nor to risking the
accommodations or no accommodations of
the ventas and posadas (taverns and inns)
where they might have to stop. He was
quite ready, however, to be excited and
patriotic as they passed through the famous

waters of Trafalgar, and curious to taste
sherry at Xeres, where it proved exceedingly
bad. They arrived at Seville in the
afternoon, and were driving from the station
when Alvar interrupted Cherry's astonished
contemplation of the scene with
the foregoing remark.

Ah, it pleases you ! " he said in a tone
of satisfaction, as they passed under the
Alcazar, the Moorish palace, with its wonderful
relics of a bygone faith and power
the great cathedral, said to be "a religion
in itself"  and saw the gay tints
of the painted buildings, the picturesque
turn of the streets, the infinite variety of
colour and costume, and over all the pure
blue of the sky and the glorious intensity
of Southern sunlight.

Cheriton had no words to express his
admiration, and only repeated, 

"You never told me that it was like this."

You did not understand," said Alvar ;
*' and perhaps I did not know."

He did not show any emotion, but his
face smoothed out into an expression of

satisfaction and well-being, and lie smiled
with a little air of triumph at Cherry's
ecstasies. This was what he had belonging
to himself in the background all the
time, when his relations had thought him
so ignorant and inexperienced, and Alvar,
like all the Lesters, valued himself on his
own belongings.

They drove up to the door of a large
house, painted in various colours, and with
gaily-striped blinds and balconies ; while
through the ornamental iron gates they
caught glimpses of the jjatio, gay with
flowers.

Cheriton thought of the winter's night,
the blazing fire, the shy, stiff greetings that
had formed Alvar's first glimpse of Oakby.
The great gates were opened, and as they
came in a tall old man came forward, into
whose arms Alvar threw himself with some
vehement Spanish words of greeting ; then,
in a moment, he turned and drew Cheriton
forward, saying, still in Spanish, 

My grandfather, this is my dear
brother."

Don Gruzman de la Rosa bowed profoundly,
and then shook hands with Cheriton,
who contrived to understand his greeting
and inquiry after his health, and to
utter a few words in reply, feeling more
shy than he had ever done in his life ; but
then he was at fault.

My grandfather says you are like what
our father was when he came here ; that
is true, is it not? And now come in."

Don Guzman showed the way into an
inner room, which seemed dark after the
brilliant jmtio, and was furnished much like
an ordinary drawing-room ; and here
Cheriton was introduced to Dona Luisa
Aviego, a middle-aged lady, Don Gruzman's
niece, and to two exceedingly pretty young
girls, and a little girl, her daughters. He
felt surprised at seeing them all in French
fashions. Here also was their brother, Don
Manoel, a tall, dark, solemn-looking young
man, who exactly fulfilled Cheriton' s idea of
a Spaniard, and enabled him to understand
Dona Luisa' s remark that Alvar had
grown into an Englishman. The old

grandfather was like a picture of Don
Quixote, a very ideal of chivalry, which
character a life of prudent, careful indifferentism
entirely belied.

Alvar would not let Cherry stay to talk,
telling him that he must rest before dinner,
which was at five, and soon took him upstairs
into a very comfortable bedroom,
looking out on a pretty garden, and
opening into another belonging to himself.

Cheriton laughed and submitted, but the
novelty and beauty had taken his impressionable
nature by storm and carried him quite
out of himself. When left alone, he had
leisure for the surprising thought that his
father had gone through all these experiences
without their apparently leaving any trace
except one of distaste and aversion ; next,
to wonder whether it was Alvar' s fault or
their own that they had remained so ignorant
of Alvar' s country ; and lastly, that
spite of the similarity of colouring to his
Spanish kindred and something in the carriage,
Alvar did look like a Lester and an
Englishman after all.

Cherry had got used by this time in
some degree to the Spanish eatables, and
as he liked the universal chocolate and was
as little fanciful as any one so much out of
health could be, he got on as well as his
bad appetite would let him, with the ollas
and gazpachos spite of their garlic, and at
any rate he liked omelettes and the bread,
which was excellent. Their servant,
Robertson, had, however, regarded everything
Spanish with such horror, and had
proved of so little use and so disagreeable,
that Cheriton finally cut the knot by sending
him back to Gibraltar, where he hoped
to find a homeward-bound family, Alvar
being certain that there would be sufficient
attendance at his grandfather's.

Conversation at dinner was difficult.
They all understood a little English, which
was rather more available than Cheriton' s
Spanish, and Don Manoel spoke tolerably
fluent French, to which, as Cheriton had in
his time earned several French prizes, he
ought to have been able to respond more
readily than was perhaps the case. Cheriton

did not mind seeing grapes and melons
eaten after son, though he thought the
taste an odd one, but he coukl not quite
reconcile himself to the universal smoking
after the first course in the presence of the
ladies. The young ones were very silent,
though they cast speaking glances at him
with their great languishing eyes ; till after
dinner the little girl, whom Cherry thought
the softest and prettiest thing he had ever
seen, produced a great blushing and tittering
by whispering a question, which, while
apparently reproving. Dona Carmen was
evidently encouraging her to repeat to
Alvar, who sat on her other side.

Alvar laughed and shook his head.

*' No, Dolores ; I think there is not one
like him," he said, adding to Cherry 
'' She wants to know if all Englishmen are
like you  white and golden like the saints
in the cathedral. It is true, she means the
painted statues."

T am pale, because I have been ill," said
Cherry, in his best Spanish, and holding
out his hand. " Little one, will you make

VOL. II. N

friends ? What shall I say to lier,
Alvar ? "

But Dolores, with an ineffable expression
of demure coquetry, retreated upon her
sister, and would not accept his attentions,
though she peeped at him under her long
eye-lashes directly he turned away.

The family met at eleven for a sort of
dejeuner a la fourchette, but every one had
chocolate in their own rooms at any hour
they pleased, with bread or sponge-cake,
which they called ;pan del Bey. Alvar
brought some on the next morning to
Cheriton and while he was drinking it proceeded
to enlighten him a little on the
family affairs and habits.

I perceive that the prayer-bell does
not ring at half-past eight," said Cherry
smiling.

*' No, the ladies all go to church every
morning. In the country my grandfather
is up early, and Manoel too, but here I
cannot say  we meet at eleven. It is usual
to write letters or transact business in the
morning on account of the heat."

'does Don Manoel  is tliafc what I ought
to call him ?  live here ? Has he anything
to do ? "

Alvar then explained that Manoel had
no regular occupation, having a little money
of his own. He smoked and played cards,
and went to the casino, '' that is what you
call a club." Moreover he was a very good
Catholic, and though he had not openly
joined the Carlist party  the Royalists as
Alvar called them  he was thought to have
a leaning towards them : but Don Guzman
never allowed politics to be discussed in
his house  neither politics nor religion.

Is he a ' good Catholic,' too ? " asked
Cherry.

Alvar shrugged his shoulders.

He conforms," he said. " You understand
that I am English. I have no
part in these matters, otherwise at times
my grandfather might have suffered
for allowing me to be brought up as a
Protestant ; but I was taught to see that
they did not concern me. But, queries,
you must not talk and ' discuss ' as you

N 2

do with Jack at lionel or you might make
a quarrel."

'' No, I understand that. But if I were
you I should not like to be supposed to bean
outsider."

'' In both countries ?" said Alvar. " No ;
but you see I had been taught that I was
an Englishman."

Yet your grandfather would not let
you come to England when you. were a
boy."

'' My grandfather," said Alvar, '' hates
the priests. He would rather have me for
his heir, though I am a heretic, than
Manoel. That is true, though he would
not say so. Look, he has seen many
changes in this country, one is as bad as
the other ; he would rather be quiet and
let things pass. So would I."

The Vicar of Bray," murmured Cherry.
** That creed is born of despair," he said
aloud. '' I should be miserable to think
so of any country."

"Yes?" said Alvar, with a sort of
unmoved inquiry in his tone. " You have

convictions. In England the are not
difficult. But, besides, my grandmother
loved me very much, and not only was she
religious like all women, she was what you
call good. She would not part with me,
and I loved her''

Alvar paused and put his hand across
his eyes, with more emotion than he often
showed*

*' She thought," he continued, " that I
should perhaps become a Catholic if I
married a Sevillana, and that my father's
neglect would make me altogether a De la
Rosa. Forgive me, Cherito, it is not quite
to be forgotten."

I think it was very likely to be the
case," said Cheriton.

"No, it was not the part for my father's
son, nor for an Englishman, nor did my
grandfather wish it. I am no Catholic 
never ! "

I suppose your tutor was  was a strong
Protestant ? " said Cheriton, rather surprised
at the first religious conviction he
had ever heard from Alvar' s lips.

'' Well, I do not think you would have
approved of him nor my father if he had
known. He, what is it you say ?  did no
duty  and I do not think he was much
like your Mr. Ellesmere. He told me that
he was paid ' to put the English doctrines
into me and teach me to speak English ; '
and he would say, 'Remember it is your
part to be a Protestant because you are an
English gentleman.' "

But," said Cherry, " when you came to
England you must surely have seen that
we did not look on it in that way ? "

'' I did not much attend to your words
on it," said Alvar. '' As you know, what
my father required of me I did, and I saw
that English gentlemen thought much of
their churches and their priests  or at
least, that my father did so. I conformed,
but I had not expected that in England,
too, I should be a foreigner  a stranger.
And I would not be other than my real
self."

'i'm afraid we were very unkind to

you."

"You? Never'' said Alvar.

But wliy did you never tell me all this
before ? I should have understood you so
much better."

I did not think of it till I considered
what would seem strange to you here
what you would not comprehend
easily."

Cheriton remained silent. That Alvar
had all his life considered himself so
entirely as a Lester and an Englishman
was a new light to him, and he could fully
appreciate the check of finding himself
regarded by the Lesters as an alien, for he
knew that even he himself had never
ceased so to look upon Alvar.

"We understand each other now," he
said affectionately. " I am glad you
have told me this. But, Alvar, though
convictions ' may seem to you easy in
England, you would make a great mistake
if you imagined that the religion of such a
man as my father was for the sake of what
you call conformity, and that it did not
influence his life."

'' 'No' said Alvar, " I did not think so
of my father and you. I did not comprehend
at first, but I see now that  it interests
you."

'' Never doubt that," said Cheriton
earnestly. *you have seen all my
failures, but never doubt that is the one
thing ' interesting,' the one thing to  to
give one another chance."

He paused as a look of unspeakable
enthusiastic conviction passed over his
face; then blushed intensely, and was
silent. Like most young men, whatever
their views, he was in the habit of talking
a good deal of '' theology," and could have
rectified Alvar's hazy notions with ease;
but personal experiences in such discussions
were generally left on one side.

Alvar did not follow him ; but perhaps
that look made more impression than a
great many arguments on the status of
religion in England.

Don't imagine I underrate your difficulties,
or my own, or any one's," Cherry
added hurriedly.

*' I have no difficulties," said Alvar
simply ; " I believe you  always  Now,
do not talk any longer  rest before you
get up'*

Clieriton now perceived that the sort of
separation that had been pursued with
regard to Alvar accounted for much of his
indolence and indifference. He recognized
how deeply his pride had been wounded
by his kindred's cold reception, and he ina
measure understood the sort of loyalty,
half-proud, half-faithful, that held him to
his own. He found that Alvar had never
written a word of complaint of his family
home to Seville ; he perceived that as time
went on he dropped nothing that he had
acquired in England, either of dress or
speech, attended the English service at
the Consulate regularly, even if Cheriton
was unable to go, and preferred to be
called Mr. Lester. Cheriton saw that he
intended no one to think that his English
residence had been a failure.

But there was one phase of this feclhig
of which even Cheriton had no suspicion.

Alvar did not forget that one tiling had
belonged to him in England, to wliicli
Spain offered no parallel. He refused to
answer any questions from this grandfather
as to his engagement or its breach. He
had not been brought up to think that
romantic passion was a necessary accompaniment
of a marriage engagement, but
rather as a thing to be got through j&rst ;
and it had been with a very quiet appreciation
that he had given his hand away at
his father's request. And when Virginia
was once his, he was thoroughly contented
with her, her rejection had wounded him
exceedingly, and now he missed her confiding
sweetness increasingly, he felt that
a good thing was gone from him, and he
would not now have attempted to console
Cheriton as he had done at Oakby. But
he never spoke of his feelings, and as
Cheriton could not think that he had acted
rightly by Virginia, the subject was never
mentioned between them.

CHAPTER XXIX.

EL Too.

The ungentle sport that oft invites
The Spanish maid and cheers the Spanish swain."

One of Alvar's first occupations was to
find a lodging for the Stanforttis, and for
one of the Miss Weston, whom the
brought with them, and he succeeded in
obtaining a flat in a casa de imjpillos or
"pension, not far from the De la Rosa's, ina
picturesque street, with a pleasant shady
sitting-room, where Mr. Stanford could
paint. There was a delightful landlady,
Senora Catalina, who went to mass with
the greatest regularity every morning, but
afterwards was ready to spend any part of
the day in escorting the ladies wherever
they wished to go, only objecting to

Gipsy's dislike to allow lier dress to trail
on the pavement, a point on which neither
could convince the other, Spanish ladies
considering the looping of the dress
improper, and Gipsy not being able to
reconcile herself to the normal condition of
the pavements of Seville. Mr. Stanford,
however, frequently accompanied them,
and they did a vast amount of sight-seeing,
in which they were joined by the two
Lesters so far as Cheriton's strength would
permit ; and as sketching often made Mr.
Stanford stationary, Cherry liked to sit
by him, enjoying a great deal of discursive
talk on things in general, and entering
with vivid interest into the novelty and
beauty around. Cherry asked a great
many more questions about Moorish
remains, and ecclesiastical customs, than
Alvar was at all able to answer ; and as his
Spanish improved, endeavoured to pick
the brains of every one with whom he
came in contact ; was so intelligent and so
inquisitive about the arrangement of the
different churches, that old Padre Tome,

the ladies' confessor, looked upon him as a
possible convert, and tliougli solemnly
warned bj Alvar never to talk politics
with any one, could not always resist teasing
him by hovering round the subject.
He got on very well with Don Guzman,
and listened to a great deal of prosing
about the best way of breeding young
bulls for the ring, and about all the
varieties of game to be found on the old
gentleman's country estate, and soon perceived
that he had considerably underrated
the sporting capacities of the peninsula.
He was not a favourite with Don Manoel,
who suspected himself of being laughed at ;
and though Dona Luisa was very kind to
him, he was hardly allowed to exchange a
word with the young ladies, and to his
great amusement perceived that he was
considered likely to follow his father's
example, and make love to them. Little
Dolores, however, was less in bondage to
propriety, and became very fond of him,
making vain endeavours to pronounce
Cherry," and teaching him a great deal

of Spanisli. Miss "Weston, who was a
hearty enthusiastic woman, with rather an
overpowering amount of conversation,
approved of what she called his spirit of
inquiry, and was possibly not insensible to
his good looks and winning manners. He
did not now shrink from home letters, and
indeed spent more time than Alvar thought
good for him in replying to Jack's voluminous
disquisitions on his first weeks of
Oxford. Alvar thought that he had
entirely recovered his spirits, and indeed
Cheriton was one whose "mind had a
thousand eyes," and they let in a good
deal of surface light, though he was himself
well aware of colder, darker depths whose
sun had set for ever, and which could only
be reached by the slowly penetrating rays of
a far intense light. Though no word of
direct confidence ever passed between him
and Mr. Stans orth, the latter knew perfectly
well that mental as well as physical change
had been sought in the sunny south. His
health improved considerably, though with
many ups and downs, he felt fairly welland

did not attempt to try the extent of
bis powers.

He was very anxious not to be a
restraint on Alvar's intercourse with his
friends or on his natural occupations ; but
except that he sometimes went to evening
parties which Cheriton avoided, Alvar
generally preferred escorting Gipsy and
Miss Weston to the tops of all the buildings
which Mr. Stanford sketched from
below, or into every corner of the Alcazar,
and every chapel of the cathedral, both of
which places had a wonderful charm for
Cheriton.

Miss Stanford was allowed to make
friends with Alvar' s cousins. Carmen and
Isabel. She had once gone to a fancy
ball, dressed in a mantilla, and had been
told that she looked " very Spanish," with
her dark eyes and hair; a delusion from
which she awoke the first time she saw
her new friends dressed for church (they
did not wear mantillas often on secular
occasions) ; and great was their amusement
at Gipsy's vain endeavour to give

exactly the becoming twist to the black
lace, and to flirt her fan in the approved
style. Gripsy was a bit of a mimic, but she
could not satisfy herself or them.

'' It is of no use. Miss Stanford," said
Oheriton, when she complained to him of
her difficulties. *' Alvar does not like
walking out with me in an ' Ulster ' when
the wind is cold, so he endeavoured to
teach me to wear one of those marvellous
cloaks which they all throw about their
shoulders ; but I can only get it over my
head, and under my feet, and everywhere
that it ought not to be."

'well," said Alvar, "you would not
let me go to Hazelbyby in my cloak; you
said that the little boys would laugh at
me."

"But a great coat," said Cherry, "is a
rational kind of garment that can't look
odd anywhere."

"That is as you think," said Alvar;
"but I do not care what you wear,
if you like it. You will not certainly
look like a Spaniard even in the cloak."

A great coat," said Mr. Stanford,
"is one of those graceful garments which
have commended themselves to all ages.
I do not know what early tradition was
followed by the inventors of Noah's Arks
in the case of that patriarch  "

Now, Mr. Stanford, that is too hard,"
interrupted Cherry. " At least it has
pockets."

"So many," said Alvar, " that what
you want is always in another one."

Alvar, that cloak is your one weakness.
You clung to it in England, and you
put it on the moment you landed in Spain."

Cheriton thinks it is a seal-skin," said
Mr. Stanford smiling.

"Seal-skin," said Alvar. "No, it is
cloth and silk."

Did you never hear of the fisherman
who married a mermaid, and she lived
happily on shore till she fell in with a sealskin
; when she put it on, and, forgetting
her husband and children, jumped into the
sea, and never came up any more ? "

"Ah, no!" said Alvar. "It is only
VOL. II.

that 1 want Cherry to be comfortable while
he is down among the fishes."

'' I will take to it some day, for the sake
of astonishing Jack," said Cherry. " But,
Alvar, those friends of yours last night
were very much interested in my travelling
coat, and asked me if it was a Paris
fashion. They put it on, and I tried to
get Don Manoel into it ; but he thought it
was a heretical sort of affair."

*' Cherry if you laugh at Manoel, he
will think you insult him. He hates
Englishmen, and our father especially.
He was angry because you gave the jessamine
to Isabel  and  we are polite here to
each other ; but if there is what you calla
row, it is worse than when every one is
sulky all at once at Oakby."

Cherry looked as if the temptation to
provoke this new experience was nearly
irresistible ; but Alvar continued to Mr.
Stanford, 

I am glad that Cherito should laugh
once more as he used to do ; but my cousin
does not understand."

My dear Alvar, I will content myself
with laughing at you ; you always understand
a joke, don't you? "

"I do not care if I understand or no.
"When I see you laughing," said Alvar
simply, " that is good."

Something in this speech so touched
Cheriton that his laughter softened away
into a very doubtful smile, and he changed
the subject; but he tried afterwards to
propitiate Don Manoel by the most courteous
treatment. The Spaniard did not
respond, and he perceived that contending
elements were discordant in Seville as well
as in England.

Carmen and Isabel found novelty less
distasteful. It is true that they thought
Gipsy's free intercourse with their cousin
Alvar and with the English stranger
shocking ; but they preferred them to any
other subject of conversation, and Isabel
in particular made quite a romance of the
incident of the Cape Jessamine, and how
Don Cherito had looked at her when he
gave it to her.



"But why shouldn't lie pick a bit of
jessamine for you, if you couldn't reach it
for yourself ? " asked Gipsy.

Oh, Manoel said it was an attention."

Oh dear no," said Gipsy, rather
cruelly, " we shouldn't think anything of
it in England. Don Manoel needn't be
afraid."

"Oh, but Manoel is terrible. He swore
before Don Thereto came that he would
poniard us if we, like our Aunt Maria,
listened to a heretic, a stranger. For Don
Gerald was a wild wicked Englishman,
but beautiful in the extreme ; they have no
religion, and no morals."

Isabel ! "

Ah, I tell you what Manoel says. He
came, he pretended an accident, and then
Dona Maria married him. Now, he says
it is the same with Don Thereto. An illness
 "

Any one can see that Cheriton Lester
is really ill, at any rate."

Well  Manoel was angry with my
grandfather for letting him come, and he

has told Alvar that it should be death
before such a marriage. Alvar told him
he knew nothing of his English brother,
who loved an English lady. But Manoel
says that what happened once might again
happen."

Isabel," said her sister, " it is wrong
to talk of this. If Niagara repeats it, there
will be a quarrel."

"I shall not repeat it," said Gipsy;
but it is all nonsense, I assure you."

Ah," said Isabel, " Manoel knows not.
He knows not that Hove one whom I have
seen at mass, though I know not his name.
But with my fan I can show him  "

Isabel ! " again said the grave Carmen
; while Gipsy, who was far too well
bred and well brought up to have made
signs in church with anything, thought
that " mass " and " a signal with a fan "
sounded interesting, and that what would
have been highly unladylike at home was
rather romantic in Seville.

On their side. Carmen and Isabel thought
Gipsy hardly used in being kept away from

the bull fights, though she was too loyal to
her nationality to express any wish to see
them.

Don Manoel was a great lover of the
ring, and as certain young bulls from Don
Guzman's estate were to be brought forward
at the last corsica of the season, there
was a great desire that the Englishmen
should be present. Mr. Stanford intended
to avail himself of the chance of seeing
such a spectacle, and Cheriton, Don Guz-
man said, might see one contest, and go
away before the other bulls were brought
forward, if he found the fatigue too much
for him. They would get seats on the
shady side of the bull-ring, the great amphitheatre
said to be capable of holding ten
thousand spectators.

Cheriton, who went against Alvar's wish,
did not stay for the end, and Mr. Stan-forth
went to see if he had repented of the
rather perverse desire to prove himself
capable of enduring the spectacle. He
found him, still full of excitement, resting
on a sofa in the patio; while Alvar sat

near him, smoking, and looking cool and
bored, as if the bull-fight had been a croquet
party.

Mr. Stanford's entrance was rather
inopportune, for Cherry was still too full
of his impressions not to talk of them,
and, in answer to Mr. Stanford's question,
said eagerly,

Oh, the heat has tired me  that is nothing.
But it made one feel like a fiend.
I felt all the fascination of it  even the
horror had a dreadful sort of attraction.
I could not have come away if Alvar had
not pulled me out when I was too dizzy to
resist him."

Very unwholesome fascination," said
Mr. Stanford.

Unwholesome ! I should think so ! It
is abominable that such things should be.
I tell Alvar that in bis place I never would
encourage an appeal to the worst passions
of human nature!'

Well, you would go, mi caro. I told
you you woidd not like it," said Alvar
coolly.

You should set an example of indignation
! "

I ? I do not care what they do to
amuse themselves. It does not interest
me, as much, I think, as it did you, my
brother."

No," said Cherry slowly, " I understand
a good many things by this. I
should be as bad as any of them. But
when a country encourages and allows such
amusements,' when women look on and
like it, one cannot wonder at Spanish
cruelties. It appeals to everything that is
bad in one."

You insult my country and your hosts !
Don Cherito, such language is unpardonable
! " exclaimed an unexpected voice ;
and Don Manoel came suddenly forward
from one of the curtained doorways, close
at hand. " What right have you, senor,
to speak of our ancient customs in terms
like these?"

I beg your pardon," said Cheriton,
after a moment's pause of amazement, '' if
I have said anything to annoy you; but 

I was not aware that you were present.
I was speaking to my brother."

Would you insinuate that I disguised
my presence ? " cried the Spaniard, with
real rage in his tones, and a 'determination
to show it.

Then Alvar fired up with the sudden
passion that had always startled his English
kindred.

How dare you so address my brother !
He shall say what he chooses ! "

'' He shall not  nor you either! You
call yourself Spaniard  Andaluz  you
claim rights in Seville, and listen with complacence
to the cowardly scruples  "

Here Alvar broke in with much too
rapid Spanish for the Englishmen to follow,
interrupted as it was by Manoel's rejoinder,
and by furious gestures as if the
disputants were going to fly at each other's
throats, while Mr. Stanford's mild attempts
at interposing with  " Come  come
now ; what nonsense ! What is all this
about?" were entirely unheard.

Meanwhile, Cheriton's previous excitement

cooled clown completely. He got up
from the sofa, and stepped between them,
laying his hand on Alvar's arm.

'' Excuse me, Alvar," he said, in his slow,
'careful Spanish, "this seems to be my
affair. Sen or Don Manoel, will you have
the goodness to tell me why you are
offended with me ? "

He called you a coward  you, my
brother ! "

''My dear fellow, be quiet, don't be an
ass." (This in English for Alvar's benefit.)
" Would you tell me what has provoked
you ?"

Senor Don Cherito," said Manoel,
forced to answer civilly by Cheriton's coolness
 " first, did you mean to insinuate
that I listened to your conversation with
my cousin ? "

By no means," said Cherry. '' I merely
meant to say that I had not seen you."

Then I ask you, senor, to repeat or to
withdraw the remarks you made about the
bull fight," said Don Manoel, with the air
of delivering an ultimatum.

He will not withdraw them ! " cried
Alvar. '' He is no coward ! "

I hope," said Cheriton, '' I did nothing
to offend. Were I in Don Manoel's place
I should feel, I am sure, as he does. I,-
too, am attached to the customs of my
country. It is no doubt difficult for a
stranger to judge. If I said the sport was
cruel, I did not for a moment mean to imply
that  that  those who see it must be cruel.
Excuse my bad Spanish. I cannot express
myself, but  pray let us shake hands."

He smiled, and held out his hand.

Well, senor, you are Don Guzman de
la Rosa's guest. If this is meant for an
apology"

For having offended you  yes. Being
Don Guzman's guest, I could not quarrel
with his nephew."

''I accept the apology," said Don Manoel,
with much solemnity, aud accepting
Cherry's hand.

But," said Alvar, " you applied an
expression to my brother."

Oh, nonsense, Alvar : you kiiow we

never think of ' expressions ' when we are
angry; and I'm not aware of having
had any opportunity ol showing either
cowardice or courage."

Hem," said Mr. Stanford, in English,
a tolerably cool head, I think."

Don Manoel, who appeared to have made
up his mind to be magnanimous, remarked
that his expression had been used too
hastily to a stranger; but that a true
Spaniard would look on any scene with equanimity.
Cherry's lip curved a little, as if he
thought this a doubtful advantage ; but he
answered with a laugh, 

I am a stranger, senor ; and besides,
I was fatigued."

Ah," said Manoel, " that amounts to
an entire excuse. The expression is withdrawn."


And with a profound bow to Cheriton, he
went away, and Cherry burst out laughing.

What in the world did all that mean?"
he said. " Did I really offend his national
pride by turning sick at the dying
horses ? "

That is not all," said Alvar hurriedly ;
he hates the English and us all ; he
would like to kill me."

Ah, ha, Alvar, it is my turn to talk
about ' excitement ' now."

"Well, T do not understand you. When
you came home you could not be still;
you seemed crazy. And now, when any
gentleman would be enraged, you laugh."

"Oh, I hate quarrels. And besides,"
shrugging his shoulders, " why in the
world should I care for such mock-heroics
as that ? "

"Ah, Cherry," said Mr. Stanford,
"there spoke the very essence of English
scorn."

Cheriton coloured.

True," he said, candidly, " Don
Manoel had a right to be angry with
me, after all. But I don't mean it. I
dare say he isn't half a bad fellow."

"Ah, you are coughing. You will be
tired out ; and I am sure that you will not
sleep," said Alvar. " Come, you shall not
talk any more about anything."

Very wise advice," said Mr. Stanford,
especially as Gipsy has persuaded the
whole party to cone tomorrow to see my
sketches, and drink English ' afternoon
tea.' So rest now in preparation."

Cheriton paid for his day's work by a
bad night and much weariness. Don
Manoel made very polite inquiries after
him ; but there was something in the
atmosphere that, to quote Alvar, Cherry
did not understand."

CHAPTER XXX.

Nettle AT BAY.
A child, and vain."

After the departure of the travellers, a
period of exceeding flatness and dulness
settled down on Oakby and its neighbourhood.
The weather was dismal, one or
two other neighbouring families were
away, and no one thought it worth while
to do anything. Jack had refused a congenial
invitation, and conscientiously
stayed at home " to make it cheerful,"
until he went up to Oxford ; but, though
he was too well conducted and successful
not to be a satisfactory son, he and his
father were not congenial, and never could
think of anything to say to each other.
He had outgrown companionship with

Bob, and did not now get on very well
with him ; while Nettie was never sociable
with any one but her twin. Mrs. Lester,
though very attentive to her son's dinners
and other comforts, did not trouble herself
much about the boys, and moreover did
not possess the comfortable characteristic
common to most elderly ladies  of being
often to be found in one place. As Jack
expressed it to himself, "no one was ever
anywhere ; " and prone as he was to look
on the dark side of things, the thought
that this was what home would be without
Cherry, was perpetually before his mind.
He did not like to go to Elderthwaite, and
saw nothing of its inhabitants till one
misty day early in October, as he was
walking through the lanes with Rota and
Buffer at his heels, he came suddenly upon
Virginia, leaning over a stile, and looking,
not at the view, for there was none, but at
the mist and the distant rain. Her figure,
in its long waterproof cloak, under an arch
of brown and yellow hazel boughs, had an
indescribably forlorn aspect ; but Jack,

awkward fellow, was conscious of nothing
but a sense of embarrassment and doubt
what to say. She started and coloured
up, but with greater self-possession spoke
to him, and held out her hand.

How d'ye do ? " said Jack. '' Down,
Buffer, you're all over mud."

Oh, never mind, I don't care, dear
little fellow ! " exclaimed Virginia, who
would have hugged Buffer, mud and all,
but for very shame. " I did not know you
were at home. Jack."

Yes, but I'm going to Oxford next
week."

And  and you have good accounts of
Cherry ? "

*' Yes, pretty good, better than at first.
He says that he looks better, and does not
cough so much, and he likes it,  so he
says, at least," replied Jack, who, conceiving
that propriety precluded the mention
of Alvar's name, found his personal pronouns
puzzling.

I am very glad," said Virginia softly.

Yes, I suppose they are at Seville by

VOL. II. p

this time ; they stayed at San Jose till
Cherry vas stronger. Al  he  they
thought it best."

Your eldest brother would be very
careful of him, I am sure," said Virginia,
with a gentle dignity that reassured Jack,
though she blushed deeply.

'* Yes," he said more freely, " and they
have made some friends ; Mr. Stanford,
the artist, you know, and his daughter ;
they're very nice people, and they have
been learning Spanish together. He
writes in very good spirits," concluded
Jack viciously, and referring to Cherry,
though poor Virginia's imagination supplied
another antecedent.

I am glad to hear it," she said. " I
met that Miss Stanford once. She was a
pretty, dark-eyed child then. Good-bye,
Jack, I am going soon to stay with my
cousin Ruth."

Good-bye," said Jack, with a scowl
which she could not account for. " I
hope you'll enjoy yourself."

'' Good-bye ; good-bye, Buffer."

Jack took his way home through the
wet shrubberies. He felt sorry for Virginia,
whom he regarded as injured by
Alvar, but he thought that she ought to be
angry with Ruth, never supposing that the
latter' s delinquencies were unknown to her.

As he walked on he passed by a cart
shed belonging to a small farm of his
father's above which was a hay loft,
reached by a step ladder, to the foot of
which Buffer and Rolla both rushed, barking
rapturously, and trying to get up the
ladder.

Hullo ! what's up ?  rats, I suppose,"
thought Jack; and mounting two or
three steps of the very rickety ladder, he
looked into the loft, his chin on a level
with the floor. Suddenly a blinding heap
of hay was flung over his head ; there was
a scuffle and a rush, and Jack freed himself
from the hay to find his head in
Nettie's very vigorous embrace ; and to
see Dick Seyton swing himself down from
the window of the loft and run away.

Stop, I say. Nettie, let go, what are
p 2

you doing here ? Dick, stop, I say,"
cried Jack, scrambling up the ladder and
rushing to the window ; but Dick had
vanished.

Don't stamp, Jack, you'll come
through ; you should have run after him,"
said Nettie saucily.

Jack turned, but caught his foot in a
hole and fell headlong into the hay, while
Nettie sat and laughed at him, and the
dogs howled at the foot of the ladder.

Jack picked himself up cautiously, and
sitting down on the hay, for there was
hardly room for him to stand upright, said
severely, 

'now, Nettie, what is the meaning of
this ? "

*' The meaning of what ? "

Of your being here with Dick. I
told you in the summer that I didn't
approve of your being so friendly with
him, and now I insist on knowing at
once what you were doing with him."

'well, then, I shan't tell you," said
Nettie coolly.

I say you shall. I couldn't have believed
that my sister would be so unladylike.
Just tell me how often you have
met him, and what you were doing here?"

"It's no business of yours," said
Nettie, making a sudden rush at the
ladder ; but Jack caught her, and a
struggle ensued, in which of course he
had the upper hand, though she was
strong enough to make a considerable
resistance; and he felt the absurdity of
fighting with her as if she were a naughty
child, when her offence was of such a nature.

Now, Nettie," he said, in a tone that
she could not resist. " Stop this nonsense.
I mean to have an answer. What
has induced you to meet Dick Seyton in
secret, and how often have you done so ?
You can't deny that you have."

No," said Nettie, " I have, often, and
I shall ever so many times more."

I couldn't have believed it of you,
Nettie," said Jack, so seriously and so
mildly that Nettie looked quite frightened,
and then exclaimed, 

Jack, if you dare to venture to think
that I meet Dick that we may make love
to each other, or any nonsense of that
kind, I'll  I'll kill you  I'll never speak to
you again, never I "

Why  why what else can I think ? "
said Jack, blushing, and by far the more
shamefaced of the two.

'' Well, then, it's abominable and shameful
of you. Do you think I would be so
horrid ? As if I ever meant to marry
any one. I shall live with Bob."

'' Don't be so violent, Nettie. You have
acted very deceitfully."

'' Deceitfully ! Do you think I'd tell you
a story?"

As Nettie had never been known to tell
a story " in her life. Jack could not say that
he thought she would; but he replied, 

*' You have acted deceitfully. You have
run after Dick when we all thought you
were somewhere else, and  there's no use
in being in a passion  but what do you
suppose any one would think of a girl who
behaved in such a manner ? "

Nettie blushed, but answered, 

'' I can't help what any one thinks. Jack.
Know I'm right, and I must go on doing it."

*' Indeed you won't," said Jack angrily;
'' for unless you promise never to meet
him any more, I shall tell father at once
that I found you here. What do you
think Cherry would say to you ? "

Cherry would say I was perfectly right,
and would do exactly the same thing himself,"
said Nettie, triumphantly. " I am
not doing any harm ; and I must go on.
I can't tell you why I am doing it, because
I promised not, and I'll do it nearer home
if you like it better. Bob and I quarrelled
about it many a time, he knows."

'' Oh, he knows, does he ? What a fool
he must have been to let you do it."

'' He won't tell of me," said Nettie,
and he never did let me when he was at
home. But I am not a silly, horrid girl,
Jack, whatever you think ; and I'm not
flirting with Dick, nor  nor  engaged to
him; and when  when  it's right, I don't
mind people thinking so ! "

But this speech ended in a flood of tears,
as poor Nettie's latent maidenliness began
to assert itself.

'rand pray," said Jack, 'does Dick
come after you because it's right ? "

No  no," sobbed Nettie ; " because I
make him."

And how can you make him, I should
like to know?"

Nettie made no answer but renewed
tears. At last she sobbed out " Oh, Jack,
Jack, I wish you were Cherry ! "

I wish I were with all my heart,"
s-aid Jack. " Would you tell me if I were
Cherry ? "

No ; but I know lie would be kind,
and not think me horrid."

Well, Nettie, I'll try to be kind ; but
you frighten me by all this. Now just
listen. I believe I ought to tell father
directly."

Oh, Jack ! dear Jack ! Don't, [don't
  it would be dreadful ! Don't you believe
me?"

Yes," said Jack, " I believe you ; but

how do I know about a young scamp like
Dick ? You tell me the whole truth, and
then I can judge, or I shall tell my father
this moment. You're my sister, and I
shall take care of you. You've done a
thing that may be told against you all your
life, and nothing can make it right, say
what you will."

But I cant tell you, Jack ; I've promised."


Well, then, I shall have it out first
with Dick."

Oh, Jack, everything will be undone
then ! "

And pray, if you don't care about him,
why does it matter to you so much about
him?"

Indeed  indeed, Jack, I'm not in love
with him in the least. I never was with
anybody, and I never mean to be," said
Nettie, fixing her great blue eyes full on
Jack, and speaking with convincing eagerness.


'* And how about him ? " said Jack
crossly.

'' No, it's nothing to do with it," said
Nettie ; but the tone of her voice altered
a little, and Jack had a sort of feeling
that there was more in the matter than
she herself knew, for he never thought of
disbelieving her.

Will you tell, and will you promise ? "
he said.

*' No, I won't," said Nettie.

'' Then you are a very naughty, disobedient
girl, and you shall come home
with me this minute."

I hate you. Jack. I'll never forgive
you," said Nettie passionately, as she
followed him ; and all the way home she
sobbed and pouted, with an intolerable
sense of shame, while Jack, utterly puzzled,
walked by her side, a desire to horsewhip
Dick Seyton contending in his mind with
a dread of making a row.

They came in by the back-door, and
Nettie rushed upstairs at once ; while Jack,
virtuous and resolute, went into the study.

Resolute as the girl was, she listened
trembling, till her father's loud call of

Nettie, Nettie, come here this moment ! "
brought her down to the study, where were
her father, her grandmother, and Jack.

Eh, what's all this, Nettie ? " said Mr.
Lester. " I can't have you running about
the country with young Seyton. What's
the meaning of it ? "

"Papa," said Nettie, ''I haven't run
about the country. Dick and I have got
a secret ; it's a very good secret."

*' Well, what is it, then ? " said her
father.

I don't mean to tell. I never tell
secrets," said Nettie, with determination.
** We have had it a long time."

My dear," said Mr. Lester, much more
mildly than he would have spoken to any
of his boys, " I must put an end to it.
You have been running wild with your
brothers till you forget how big a girl you
are getting. Never go out with Dick
again by yourself  do you hear ? "

Nettie made no answer, and her father
continued, more sternly, 

1 am sorry, Nettie, that you did not

know better how to believe. Never let
me hear of such a thing again."

Still silence ; and Jack said, 

Lie won't promise. I shall see what
Dick says about it."

Then you'll just do nothing of the
sort, Jack," said his grandmother, " making
mountains out of mole-hills. Nettie is
going to London to stay with her aunt
Cheriton, and have some music and French
lessons with Dolly and Kate. I'd settled
it all this morning. She doesn't attend
enough to her studies here. You'll
take her up when you go to Oxford, and
there'll be an end of the matter."

Yes, yes," said Mr. Lester. *' Grand-mamma
and I were talking it over just
now."

Not that it is on account of your remarks.
Jack," said Mrs. Lester. " That
would be making far too much of her
foolish behaviour ; but in London she'll
learn better."

To be sure," said Mr. Lester, who had
been stopped on his way out riding by

Jack's appeal, and was now glad to escape
from an unpleasant discussion. " Nettie
will come back at Christmas, and we shall
hear no more of such childish tricks."

Nettie looked like a statue, and never
spoke a word ; but there was a look of
fright through all her sullenness. Jack
was not accustomed to think much of her
appearance, but he knew as a matter of
fact that she was handsome, and it struck
him forcibly that she looked " grownup."


You've done more harm than you
know," she said; " but I will not tell, and
I will not promise." And with a sort of
dignity in her air, she walked out of the
room.

What does she mean ? " said Jack.

Never you mind," said his grandmother,
" and don't you raise the countryside
on her by saying a word to Dick or
any one. Hold your tongue, and be thankful.
The Seytons are the plague of the
place, and we'll ask them all to dinner
before Nettie goes, Dick included."

*' Ask them to dinner?" said Jack.

Yes ; we'll have no talk of a quarrel.
And besides, your father finds that people
are apt to think that it was Virginia's fault
that your half-brother left her in the lurch ;
and that's not so, though she is a
Seyton."

' No, indeed ! "

"So my son means to have a dinner-party,
and to show that we are all good
friends, and pay them proper attention. A
bad lot they are ; there's not one of them
to be trusted."

But, Granny," said Jack anxiously,
*' what do you think about Nettie ? What
secret can she have ? "

"Eh, I can't tell. He may be getting
her a puppy or a creature of some kind ;
but Nettie's secret may be one and Dick's
another. T always blamed Cherry for
encouraging the Seytons about the place."

Poor Cherry ! " muttered Jack to
himself, with a great longing to throw
the burden of his difficulty on to Cherry's
shoulders.

Nettie remained sullen and impenetrable.
She treated Jack with an intense resentment
that vexed him more than he could
have supposed. Neither her father nor her
grandmother asked her any questions ; but
she was watched, though not palpably in
disgrace, and she suffered from an agony
of shame and of self-reproach which contended
strangely with the motive that in
her view justified the stolen meetings.
Whether her womanly instincts, roughly
awakened, justified the warnings given
her, or whether, she merely resented the
unjust suspicion, she herself scarcely knew,
and not for worlds would she have explained
her feelings. The dread of giving
an advantage, the intense sulky self-respect
that leads to an exaggeration of
reserve and false shame, was in her nature
as in that of all the Lesters, and if Cheriton
had been present she could not probably
have uttered a word to him. Being
absent, she could venture to soften at the
thought of him, and cried for him many a
time in secret.

CHAPTER XXXI.

Broken LINES.
Love is made a vague regret."

YiEGiNiA, when lie parted from Jack,
walked slowly homewards through the
mist and the falling leaves, and thought
of the bloom and the brightness of that
fair Seville which she had so often pictured
to herself. How happy the two
brothers would be there together, among
all the surroundings which she had heard
described so often ! Alvar would never
think of her. " At least, I should have
had letters from him if I had not sent him
away," she thought ; and though she did
not regret the parting in the sense of
blaming herself for it, she felt in her utter
desolation as if she had rather have had

her lover cold and indifferent than not have
him at all.

For life was so dreary, home so wretched,
and Virginia could not mend it. Indeed
in many ways a less high-minded girl
with stronger spirits and more tact might
have been far more useful there. Virginia
held her tongue resolutely ; but she
could not shut her eyes. She had lost
her bearings, and could not possibly understand
the proportion of things. Thus even
in her inmost soul she never blamed her
father for his life-long extravagance, for
the vague stories of his dissipated youth 
these things were not for her to judge ;
but the conversation, which he intended
to be perfectly fit for her ears, was full of
small prejudices, small injustices, and
trifles taken for granted that grated on her
every hour. She tried very hard to be
gentle and pleasant to her aunt ; but she
could not bring herself, as Ruth could, to
laugh at scandalous stories, old or new,
or even to think herself right in listening
to them. And though her father and aunt

VOL. II. Q

SO far as they Jcnew how, respected lier innocence,
the latter only laughed at the
ignorance that thought one thing as bad
as another. For there were virtues, or at
least self-denials in their lives, for which,
with all her love and with all her charity,
she could not possibly credit them. It
was something that Mr. Seyton had pulled
through without utterly succumbing to
debt and difficulty, it was something that
when writhing under an injury which she
never forgot or forgave, his sister stuck
to him and kept things as straight as they
were. It was a godless, idle, aimless household,
above stairs and below ; but it was
not a scandalous one, and, with all the
antecedents, it easily might have been.
But the obvious outcome of this hard narrow
life was a deadness to all outer or
higher interests, an ignorance of the ordinary
views of society, and of modern, forms
of thought never attained save by selfish
people, an absence of restraint of tempera
delight in utter littleness, which were
intensely wearying. Higher principles

would have made life more interesting if
nothing more. The narrowest form of
belief in religion and goodness would have
given a wider outlook. Virginia was sick to
death of tales of little local incidents spiced
with ill-nature, or incessant complaints
of sonne one's ill-behaviour about a fence ora
cow. If she had lived at Oakbj she
would have heard a good deal of the same
sort of thing ; but there there would have
been something else to fall back on, and
she would not have heard small triumphs
over small overreaching, which Mr. Seyton
did not mix enough with his kind to hear
commented on.

Virginia used to wonder if she would
grow like her aunt, her life was so empty.
All her young-lady interests, the essay and
drawing clubs, the correspondence and the
art needlework, with which like other girls
she had amused herself, had languished
entirely during her engagement, and she
did not care to resume them. She would
have liked to be a resource to Dick ; but
she was not used to boys, and had not
Q 2

much faculty for amusing them, and Dick
did not care for her. Her Sunday class
tired her, and were naughty because her
teaching was languid ; the children by no
means offering the consolations to her depression
which they are sometimes represented
as doing in fiction. The Ellesmeress, who
were always kind to her, were away for
their annual holiday, and the library books
for which she subscribed, and which might
have amused her, could never, by any
chance be fetched from the station when
she wanted them.

Her uncle showed his sympathy by
scolding her roundly for fretting for a
black-eyed foreigner, till she was almost
too angry to speak to him.

Under all these circumstances Ruth's
urgent invitation had been welcome, and
as she received others from her friends at
Littleton, she resolved to go and try topick
up the threads that Alvar had broken.
Soon after she parted with Jack she met the
Parson, and told him what she knew would
be welcome news, that Cherry was better.

'ray," said Mr. Seyton, " Jack brought
me a message from him that he would
write me an account of a bull-fight.
Wonder he's not ashamed to go near one.
Cruel, unmanly sport  disgraceful ! "

"Well, uncle," said Virginia, "I think
you ought to be pleased that Cherry is well
enough to go."

Eh ? I'll ask him if he'll come and
see a cock-fight when he comes home.
Plenty of 'em here  round the corner. So
you're going to London to get a little
colour in your cheeks, I think it's time."

Yes, uncle ; Mrs. Clement will teach
the children while I'm away."

Very well, and tell Miss Ruth she was
blind of one eye when she made her choice,
but I can see out of both."

Uncle, I shouldn't think of telling her
such a thing. What do you mean ? "

Never mind, she'll understand me.
Good-bye, my dear, and never mind the
Frenchman."

Virginia smiled, but she could not turn
her thoughts away, not merely from Alvar,

but from her life without him. Fain would
she have refused the invitation which soon
arrived to a solemn dinner party at Oakby;
but it had been accompanied by a hint from
Mr. Lester to her aunt which caused the
latter to insist on accepting it, and they
went accordingly to meet Sir John and
Lady Hubbard, and one or two other neighbours.
Mr. Lester was markedly polite
to Virginia. Mrs. Lester wore her best
black velvet, and a certain diamond brooch,
only produced on occasions of state. Jack
looked proper, silent, and bored. Everyone
wished to ask after the universally
popular Cheriton, but felt that Alvar was
an awkward subject of conversation, so
that the adventures of the travellers could
not be used to enliven the dulness. Nettie
did not of course appear at dinner, and
afterwards sat in a corner of the drawing-room
in her white muslin, apparently determined
not to open her mouth. Dick
strolled up to her when the gentlemen
came in, and was instantly followed by
Jack, who stood by her silent and frowning.

Nettie looked up under lier eyebrows, and
said, " Dick, I am going to London."

So I hear," said Dick, with a smile and
a slight shrug.

*' I hate it, but I can't help it. You go
orlick

smiled again and nodded, and then
looked at Jack with an air of secret amusement,
indescribably provoking. *' All
right," he said, but he turned away and
made no further demonstration ; and Mrs.
Lester desired Nettie to show Miss Hubbard
" Views on the Thine," a very handsome
book reserved for occasions of unusual
dulness.

Altogether the evening did not raise
Virginia's spirits, and she was half inclined
to resent the special kindness shown to herby
Mr. Lester, as implying blame to his
absent son.

It was a wonderful change of scene and
circumstance, when she found herself, some
few days later, sitting in Lady Charlton's
pleasant London drawing-room, full of
books, work, plants, and pretty things.

with Ruth, bright-eyed and blooming, sitting
on the rug at her feet, ready for a confidential
chatter.

She was to be married directly after
Christmas, she told Virginia. Rupert did
not mean to sell out of the army ; she did
not at all dislike the notion of moving
about for a few years, and now the regiment
was at Aldershot she could see Rupert
often while she remained in London to get
her things.

'rand, Queenie, you must choose the
dresses for the bridesmaids. Grandmamma
will have a gay wedding. I think it will
be a great bore."

"Your bridesmaids ought to wear something
warm and gay and bright, like yourself,
Ruthie. Are you going to ask Nettie
Lester ? "

'' Oh, no ! " said Ruth hurriedly. '' Why
should I ? "

'' She is Rupert's cousin, and she is so
handsome."

I never thought of her ! I am angry
with them all since Don Alvar has made

you miserable. My darling Queenie, I
should like to stamp on him ! Now, don't
be angry; but tell me how it all came
about ? ''

I don't think I could ever make you
understand it, Ruth. He did nothing
wrong. It was only that  that I did not
suit him, and I found it out," said Virginia,
with a sort of ache in her voice, as she
turned her head away.

The more  well, I won't finish the
sentence. Any way, he has spoiled your
life for you ; for I am afraid he is your
love if you are not his," said Ruth, scanning
her sad face curiously. " Queenie,
weren't you ready to kill him and Cherry,
too, when they went off comfortably
together ? "

*' No," said Virginia, "he could not
help going  that was not it. And as for
Cherry, he was the only person who understood
anything about it  he was so kind !
Oh, I hope he is really better ! "

*' I dare say he is, by this time," said
Ruth, rather oddly; 'but they are all so

easily frightened about him  they spoil
him. I wonder what they would all say if
lie fell in love with a naughty, wicked
siren  a female villain, who broke his heart
for him -just for fun''

She would break something worth
having," said Virginia indignantly. " But,
do you know anything about Cherry,
Ruth ? "

I ? I don't believe in sirens who break
hearts just for fun and vanity.  .And as
for Cherry, if he did meet with a little
trouble, he'd mend up again, heart and
lungs and all. There's something 
about him  don't you think so ? "

I think Cherry is too many-sided to be
left without an object in life, if that is what
you mean," said Virginia. *' Besides, it is
so different for a man, they can always
do something."

Then Ruth put aside the little uneasy
feeling of self-reproach and doubt that had
prompted her to talk about Cherry, and
put her arms round Virginia, kissing her
tenderly.

My darling Queenie ! You have been
fretting all by yourself at Elderthwaite till
things seem worse than they are."

No," said Virginia ; ' but my life has
all gone wrong. When I found that he
did not love me everything seemed over
for me."

Ruth interposed a question, and at last acquired
a clearer knowledge of the circumstances
under which Alvar and her cousin
had parted. She had a good deal of knowledge
of the world, and some judgment,
though she did not always use it for her
own benefit, and she did not think that the
case sounded hopeless. She tried an experiment.


If you gave him up, Queenie, because
you discovered that he did not come up to
your notions of what he ought to be, why
there's an end of it, for he never will;
but it looks to me much more like a very
commonplace lovers' quarrel aggravated
by circumstances. He isn't a bad sort of
fellow in his own way; but it's not the
way that you think perfection."

*' I did not quarrel with him, and T think
the failure was in myself. Wliy should
lie love me ?  it does not seem as if I was
very lovable."

There crossed Virginia's yt)ung gentle
face a look that was like a foretaste of the
bitterness and self-weariness that had seized
on so many of her race  a sort of self-scorn
that was not wholesome.

' Why should you think so ? " said
Ruth.

' I think I should have got on better
at home if I had been."

She spoke humbly enough, but there
was utter discouragement in every line of
her face and figure.

'' Nonsense ! " said Ruth briskly. " Nobody
would get on, in your sense, at
Elderthwaite. I don't think you ought to
stay there. You know it is quite in your
power to arrange differently. You might
make them long visits and  come fresh to
every one."

I'll never have it said that I could
not live there," said Virginia, colouring

deeply. *' And if I was away  1 could not
I would not  "

Gro back into the neighbourhood ?
Well, at any rate you are going to have
a holiday now, and see something besides
moors and mud."

The change of scene could not fail todo
Virginia good, though there might be
something in the courtship of Ruth and
Rupert to remind her, with a difference,
of her own. It was sometimes breezy, for
Rupert loved to tease his betrothed, and
having got his will, was a free-and-easy
and contented lover, not much liking to be
put out of his way, and not quite coming
up to Ruth's requirements.

Ruth, though very kind to her cousin,
believed that she had lost her lover in
great measure through a feminine scrupulosity
and desire to bring him up to her
own standard. Ruth would never be so
narrow and unsympathetic, she would be
prepared to understand all the story of her
hero's life ; and being young, and much
more simple than she believed herself to

be, thought that her indiscriminate reading
of somewhat free-spoken novels, gave her
the necessary experience. But Rupert took
quite another view. He was not aware of
having any particular story to tell, and had
no intention whatever of telling it. He
did not in the least desire Ruth's sympathy
with his past, which was quite commonplace.
He was not in a state of repentance,
desirous of making a confession ; nor had
his heart ever been withered up, by any
frightful experiences. No doubt he could
remember much that was not particularly
creditable, and which he rightly thought
unfit for discussion with his betrothed.
Moreover, he did not care at all for poetry,
and very little for novels, and at last
actually told her that one she mentioned
was unfit for her to read.

Ruth was very angry, and had a sense
of being put aside. Had Rupert  like herself
 a secret, or was she going to be
'only a little dearer than his horse " ? as
she expressed it to herself, and with tears
to him. Rupert laughed, and then grew a

little angry, and then they made it up again ;
but he teased her for her romance, laughed
at her most muscular and strong souled
heroes, and never would put himself in a
heroic attitude. Ruth quarrelled with him,
made it up with him, was vexed by him,
and sometimes was vexatious ; but all the
while she never told him about Cheriton.

CHAPTER XXXII.

DON JUAN.

I wonder if the spring tide of this year
Will bring another spring both lost and dear ;
If heart and spirit will find out their spring,
Or if the world alone will bud and sing."

It was a bright sunny day in December,
fresh enough to make the Villanous pull
their picturesque cloaks over their shoulders
out of doors, and light scraps of
wood-fire in their sitting-rooms, but with
the sun pouring down in unveiled splendour
over quaint painted relics of a bygone
world, when the Moor employed his rich
fancy in decorating the city, and over dark
Gothic arches and towers that seemed to
tell of a life almost equally remote from
nineteenth century England. It was a
very new sort of Christmas weather for
Jack Lester as he tried to find his way

from the railway station to Dou Guzman
de la Rosa's house. He soon discovered
that he had lost it, and stopped by a fruit-stall
piled with grapes, oranges, and melons
to ask the brown, skinny old woman in a
gay handkerchief who kept it, for some
directions, hoping that she would at least
understand the name of the street. So
she did, but it seemed to him that she
pointed in every direction at once, and
Jack stared round bewildered as a young
lady stepped across the street towards the
fruit-stall. Jack looked at her and she
looked full at him from under her straw
hat, with a pair of eyes dark as any in
Andalusia, but direct and clear, level and
fearless, as her face broke into a smile just
saved from a laugh.

*' If you are looking for Don Guzman de
la Rosa's," she said in distinct and comprehensible
English, "I can direct you;
but your brothers, Mr. Lester, are much
nearer, at my father's, Mr. Stanford's.
Will you come there with me when I have
bought some fruit ? "

VOL. II. E

Oh, thank you immensely ! I  I
thought I would walk up, and I couldn't
find the way. Thank you," said Jack,
colouring and looking rather foolish.

They did not expect you to be here till
tomorrow. What have you done with
your things ? "

I've lost them. Miss Stanford," said
Jack; "I can't think how. You see no
one understands anything, and the stations
coming from Madrid are so odd."

Oh, I think you will get them ; we
had one box detained for ages. Thank
you," as he took her basket of fruit.
Shall we come ? " and then, looking up at
him, *' Your brother is so much better."

'' I  -I am very glad of that," said Jack,
in a sort of inadequate way.

He was nervous about the meeting, and
felt conscious that he was dusty with his
journey, and sure that he must have looked
foolish staring at the old woman.

Gipsy took him down the street, and into
a house with a balcony covered with gay-striped
blinds and led him upstairs till she

came to a door, or rather curtain, which
she lifted, putting her finger on her

lip.

It was a long, low room, with the lights
carefully arranged and shaded, containing
drawing-boards and unframed sketches, a
wonderful heap of " art treasures," in one
corner, Algerine scarves and stuffs, great,
rough, green pitchers, and odds and ends
of colour. Some one sat with his back to
the door drawing, but Jack only beheld his
brothers who were together at the further
end of the room, and did not immediately
see him, for they were looking at each
other and appeared to the puzzled Jack
oddly still and silent.

Miss Stanford gave a little [laugh, and
Alvar looked round and exclaimed. Cheriton
sprang up, and with a cry of delight
seized on Jack, with an outburst of greetings
and inquiries, in which all the surroundings
were forgotten. Gipsy laughingly
described her encounter to Alvar ;
while " father," and " granny," " the old
parson," " no good in having a Christmas
R 2

at all at home without you," passed rapidly
between the other two.

Come, Jack, that's strong ! But,
indeed, I think you have brought Christmas
here. How rude we are ! You have never
spoken to Mr. Stanford. Mr. Stanford,
let him see the picture. Jack, do you
think father will Hke it ? "

Yes. You look much jollier than in the
photograph'* said Jack, as Mr. Stanford
turned the picture round for his inspection.


It was a small half-length in tinted chalk
showing Cherry seated and looking up, with
a bright interested face, at Alvar, who was
showing him a branch of pomegranates.
The execution was of the slightest, but the
likenesses were good, and the strong contrast
of colouring and resemblance of form
was brought out well. " Br others,  was
written underneath, and Jack looked at
them as if the idea of any one wishing to
make studies of them was strange to him.

Jack is bewildered  lost, in more
senses than one," said Cherry, smiling.

'' Come, it is time we went home, and then
for news of every one ! Mr. Stanford, we
shall see you to-night."

Jack's arrival was an intense pleasure to
Cheriton, whose reviving faculties were
beginning to long for their old interests.
He had recovered his natural spirits, and
though he still looked delicate, and
had no strength to spare, was quite well
enough to look forward to his return to England
and to beginning life there. Indeed
the ardent hopes and ambitions, so cruelly
checked in their first outlet, turned  with
a difference indeed, but with considerable
force  to the desire of distinction and
success ; and in return for Jack's endless
talk of home and Oxford, he planned the
course of study to begin at Easter, and the
hard work which he felt sure with patience
must ensure good fortune. Cheriton was
very sanguine, and since he had felt so
much bettered no doubt of entire recovery;
and Jack was accustomed to follow his
lead, and was much relieved both by his
liveliness and by his resolute mention of

Eupert. and inquiry as to the arrangements
for his marriage.

If Cheriton had not won the battle, he
was at least holding his own in it bravely
the bitter pain was first submitted to,
and then held down with a strong hand.
But surely, he thought, there was something
in store for him, if not the sweetness
of happy love, yet the ardour of the struggle
of life.

He could not say enough of Alvar's care
for him, and Jack found Alvar much more
easy of access than at home, and more
interested than he had expected in the
details of the home life ; and in the course
of conversation the dinner-party to the
Seytons, and its motive, came out.

Alvar coloured deeply; he was silent
then, but as soon as he was alone with
Cheriton he said with some hurry of
manner, 

' My brother, I am ashamed. What
can I do ? It is not endurable to me that
any one should blame Miss Seyton."

'' I suppose my. father did the only thing

there was to be done. When an engagement
is broken people generally say that
they were faults on both sides."

"That is not so," said Alvar. '' She is
as blameless as a lily. Can I do nothing ?
I am ashamed," he repeated vehemently.

'* Perhaps when you go home you will be
able to show the world that you are of a
different opinion," said Cherry very quietly,
but with difficulty suppressing a smile.

You do not understand," said Alvar ina
tone of displeasure, turning away, and
thinking that he had never before known
Cheriton so unsympathetic.

Jack did not make much way with the
de la Rosas, he did not like committing
himself to foreign languages, and was shy,
but they were very polite to " Don Juan,"
a name that so tickled Cheriton's fancy
that he adopted it at once.

Jack began by somewhat resenting his
brother's intimacy with the Stanforths asa
strange and unnecessary novelty, but he
soon fell under the charm, and pursued
Mr. Stanford with theories of art which

were received with plenty of good-humoured
banter. Gipsy, too, set to work to enlighten
him on Spanish customs ; and
having rescued him from one difficulty,
made it her business to show him the way
he should go, so that they became very
friendly, and the strange Christmas in this
foreign country drew the little party of
English closer together. There was
enough to interest them in the curious and
picturesque customs of Andalusia, but the
carols which Gipsy insisted on getting up
gave Cherry a fit of home-sickness ; and a
great longing for Oakby, and the holly and
the snow, the familiar occupations, the
dogs, and the skating came over him. It
had been a long absence ; he thought how
his father would be wishing for him, and
he experienced that sudden doubt of the
future which people call presentiment.
Would he ever spend Christmas at home
again ? He was beginning to weary a little
of the wonder and admiration that had
stood him in such good stead, and to want
the time-honoured landmarks which showed

themselves unchanged as the flood-tide of
passion subsided.

He was quite ready, however, to enter
into the plans for a tour through some of
the neighbouring towns before the Stan-fortis
should return home at the end of
January. Jack's time was still shorter ;
and as Cheriton himself had hitherto seen
nothing but Seville, a joint expedition was
proposed, with liberty to separate whenever
it was convenient, as Alvar would consent
to nothing that involved Cherry in long
days on horseback lasting after sundown,
or in extra rough living; and Mr. Stan-forth
backed up his prudent counsels.

But Cordova, Granada, and Malaga
could be managed without any extreme
fatigue, and E-onda could be reached easily
from the latter place. So in the first week
in the new year the three Lester s, Mr.
Stanford and his daughter, and Miss
Weston set off together for a fortnight's
trip. Afterwards they would all separate,
and Alvar and Cheriton, after returning fora
few weeks to Seville, were to make their

way gradually northwards, stopping in
France and Italy till the spring was further
advanced.

The tour prospered, and in due time
they found themselves at Ronda, and strolling
out together in the lovely afternoon
sunshine, reached the new bridge across
the river ; Jack and Gipsy engaged in an
endless discussion on the expulsion of the
Moors, lingering while they talked, and
looking down into the deep volcanic chasm
that divides the old town of Eonda from
the new, while nearly three hundred feet
below them roared, dashed, and sparkled
the silvery waters of the Gruadalvin. On
either side were the picturesque buildings
of the two towns, fringed with wood  in
front, miles of orchards, and beyond, the
magnificent snow-crowned mountains of the
Sierra; while over all was the sapphire
blue, and sun, which, though the year was
but a fortnight old, covered the ground
with jonquils, and hung the woods with
lovely flowers hardly known to our hothouses.


They had marvelled at the Alhambra,
and Cheriton had disclaimed all sense of
feeling himself in the Crystal Palace. They
had noticed and admired the mixture of
Moorish and Christian art) in Granada and
Cordova, and had discussed ardently all
the difficult questions of the Moorish occupation
and expulsion  discussions in which
Gipsy's fresh school knowledge, and Jack's
ponderous theories, had met in many a
hearty conflict. They had sketched, made
notes, collected curiosities, or simply enjoyed
the beauty according to their several
idiosyncrasies, and had remained good
friends through all the ups and downs of
travel ; while Cheriton had stood the fatigue
so well that he had set his heart on riding
with the others across country to Seville,
and could afford to laugh at the discomforts
incidental to eating and sleeping at Ronda.
There was much to see there, and they did
not mean to hurry away. Cherry remarked
to Alvar that Jack had improved, and was
less sententious than he used to be ; but
the cause of this increased geniality had

struck no one. Every one laughed when
Gipsy reminded him of things that he had
forgotten, talked Spanish for him because
he was too shy to commit himself to an
unknown tongue, and stoutly contradicted
many of his favourite sentiments. Writing
an essay, was he ? on the evil of regarding
everything from a ludicrous point of view.
There were a great many cases in which
that was the best point of view to look at
things, and Gipsy wrote a counter essay
which afforded great amusement. But no
one perceived when Gipsy's sense of the
ludicrous fell a little into abeyance ; and
when she ceased to contradict Jack flatly,
and began to think that she received new
ideas from him, still less did his brothers
dream of the new thoughts and aspirations
that were rushing confusedly through the
boy's mind ; he was hardly conscious of
them himself.

The pair were a little ahead of their companions,
who now came up and joined them.

Well, Jack," said Alvar, " I have been
making inquiries, and I find that we can

take the excursion among the mountains
that you wished for. Mr. Stanford prefers
making sketches here, and it would be too
rough for the ladies, or for Cherry'*

*'I suppose the mountains are very fine?"
said Jack, not very energetically.

Jack found the four hundred Moorish
steps too much for him. He has grown
lazy," said Cherry. " For my part, I think
the fruit market is the nicest place here ;
it has such a splendid view. I shall go
there tomorrow and eat melons while you
are away."

Miss Weston and I are going to buy
scarves and curiosities in the market," said
Gipsy ; " but they say we should have come
here in May to see the great fair ; that is
the time to buy beautiful things."

Yes," said Alvar, " and Mr. Stanford
might have studied all the costumes of
Andalusia. But, I think, since we ordered
our dinner two hours ago, it is likely now
to be ready. I hope the ladies are not tired
of fried pork, for I do not think we shall
get anything better."

Oh ! " said Gipsy, " I mean to get

mamma to introduce it at home ; it is so

good."

Do you, my dear ? " said her father.

I am inclined to think that with the
ordinary accompaniments of clean tablecloths
and silver forks it might be disappointing."


Without a table-cloth and with the very
primitive implements of Eonda, the fried
pork was very welcome ; and when their
dinner was over, as it was too dark to go
out any more, they went down into the
great, public room on the ground floor of
the inn, where round a bright wood fire
were gathered muleteers, other travellers
and natives, both men and women.

It was a wonderful picturesque scene in
the light of the fire, and Mr. Stanford's
sketching so delighted his subjects that
they crowded round him, only anxious that
he should draw them all, while the " English
hidalgos " were objects of the greatest
curiosity. The men came up to Jack and
Cheriton, examining their clothes, their

tobacco pouches and pipes ; and one great
fellow in a high hat, and brilliant-coloured
shirt, looking so much like an ideal brigand
that it was difficult to believe that he was
only an olive-grower, after looking at Cheriton
for some time, put out a very dirty
hand, and touched his hair and cheek as if
to assure himself that they were of the
same substance as his own. Gipsy's dress
and demeanour interested them greatly,
and one or two of them made her write her
name on a bit of paper for them to keep.

The next day's ride was fully discussed,
and much information given as to route and
destination. Then, at Cherry's request,
some of the muleteers sang to them wild
half-melancholy airs, and one of the men
danced a species of comic dance for their
edification, and then the chief musician
diffidently requested them to give a specimen
of their national music. Gripsy laughed
and looked shy ; but her father laid down
his pencil, and in a fine voice, and with
feeling that told even in an unknown
language, sang " Tom Bowling," and then,

as this gave great satisfaction, began
"D'ye ken John Peel," in the chorus of
which his companions joined him.

*' That," he explained, '' was a hunting
song. Now he would give them a really
national air;" and in the midst of this
strange audience, he struck up the familiar
notes of '' Grod save the Queen."

The English rose to their feet ; the men
lifted their hats, and all joined in and
sang the old words with more patriotic
fervour than at home they might have
thought themselves capable of ; and the
Spaniards, with quick wit and ready
courtesy, uncovered also, and when they
had finished the musician picked out the
notes on his guitar.

The weather next morning proving all
that could be wished, Alvar and Jack, with
a couple of guides, set off before daybreak
on their ride into the mountains, intending
to ascend on foot a certain peak from which
the view was very fine, and which was
accessible in the winter. The expedition
had been entirely planned for Jack's benefit,

and perhaps he was not quite so grateful
as he might have been. The others had
no lack of occupation. They went down
to the *' Nereid's Grotto, " a cave filled with
clear emerald water, near which stand an
old Moorish mill, built on rocks, fringed
with masses of maidenhair fern. Mr. Stan-forth
remained there sketching the building,
white with a sort of dazzling eastern
whiteness, the strange forms of cactus and
aloe crowning the cliffs, and the washerwomen
in gay handkerchiefs and scarlet
petticoats kneeling on the flat stones by
the river. Cheriton, with the ladies, went
on their shopping expedition to find presents
that might be sent home by Jack, and
having found some silk handkerchiefs for
his father, a wonderful sash for Nettie, and
a striped rug for his grandmother, to whom
Alvar intended to despatch some Spanish
lace already bought in Seville, he helped
Gipsy to choose a present for each of her
numerous brothers and sisters, and himself
hunted up smaller offerings for his friends
of all degrees.

VOL. II. s

This occupied a long time, especially as
the children followed them wherever they
went, " as if one was the pied piper," said
Cherry ; and afterwards they bought bread
and fruit, and ate it for luncheon, and
Gipsy reflected that in three weeks' time
she would be back in Kensington, very busy
and rather gay, and would probably never
buy pomegranates and melons in Ronda
again in all her life.

Cheriton employed himself in the evening
in writing to his father, while the
Stanforths went down again to the mixed
company below. He did not expect his
brothers till late, and was not giving much
heed to the time, when he looked up and
saw Gipsy cross the room.

Have they come back ? " he said.

'' No," said Gipsy. " Don't you think
they ought to be here soon ? "

Cherry glanced at his watch.

'* Nine o'clock ? Yes, I suppose they
will be here directly, for the guides told
us eight. People never get off mountains
as soon as they expect they will.

111 come down. I have finished my
letter."

Some time longer passed without any
sign of an arrival, and the landlord of the
inn, and some of the muleteers, began to
say that either the Anglesey must have
changed their route, or that something
must have detained them till it was too
dark to get down the mountains, so that
they must be waiting till daylight to
descend. Cheriton did not take alarm
quickly ; he knew that a very trifling
change of path or weather would make this
possible, and he was the first to say that
they had better go to bed, and expect to
see the wanderers in the morning; and
Mr. Stanford, very anxious to avoid
frightening him, chimed in with a cheerful
augury to the same effect. But
when Cheriton had left them he said,
anxiously, 

'' I don't like it ; I am sure Alvar would
not delay if he could help it  he would not
cause so much anxiety."

'' But some very trifling matter mights
2

have detained them till after dark," said
Miss Weston.

Oh, yes ; I trust it may be so."
Gipsy said nothing ; but before her
mind's eye there rose a vision of more
than one little wayside cross which she
had been shown on their ride to Ronda,
with the inscription, '' Here died Don Luis
or Don Pedro," and the date.

These were erected, she was told, where
travellers had been killed by saltiadores or
brigands ; but there were very few of such
breakers of the law in Andalusia now.
Still, their party had thought it right to
carry arms. What if they had been driven
to use them ?  what if  ? Even to herself
Gripsy could not finish the sentence ;
but she lay awake all night listening for
an arrival, till her ears ached and burnt
with the strain ; till she heard in the nighttime,
that had hitherto seemed to her so
silent, sounds innumerable ; till she felt as
if she could have heard their footsteps on
the mountain side. And all the time the worst
of it was that she heard nothing. And for

fear that Miss Weston would guess at her
terror, for speaking of it seemed to remove
it from the vague regions of her imagination
and give it new force, and also for
fear of missing a sound, she lay as still asa
mouse, till, spite of an occasional doze,
the night seemed endless, and the most
welcome thing in the world was the long-delayed
winter dawn.

Gripsy was thankful to get up and dress
and find out what was going on, and as
soon as possible she ran downstairs and
went out to the front of the inn. Her
father was just before her, and Cheriton
was standing talking to a group of guides
and muleteers. He turned round and
came up to them saying, 

I have been making inquiries, and they
say that if they kept to their intended
route  and I feel sure that they would not
change it  there is no reason to fear any
dangerous accident such as one hears of on
Swiss mountains. And the men all laugh
at the notion of any brigandage nowadays.
What I think is, that one of them may

have got some slight hurt, twisted his
foot, for instance, and been unable to get
on ; and if they don't turn up in an hour
or so I think we ought to go after them."

Cherry looked anxiously at Mr. Stan-forth
as he spoke, as if, having worked up
this view for his own benefit, he wanted to
see others convinced by it also.

'eyes," said Mr. Stanford, ''I have
been thinking of the possibility of strained
ankles too."

'' You see," said Cherry, " they must
have left their mules somewhere ; at least
we shall fall in with them."

'' Ah  ah ! they are coming," cried
Gipsy, with a scream of joy, as the sound
of hoofs were heard along the street.

Cherry dashed forward, but as the party
came into sight he stopped suddenly, then
hurried on to meet them ; for only Pedro,
one of the mule-drivers who had accompanied
them, appeared, riding one mule
and leading the other.

In the sudden downfall. Gipsy's very
senses seemed to fail her ; as she saw

Cherry lay his hand on the mule as if to
support himself, and look up, unable to
frame a question ; she could hardly hear
the confusion of voices that followed.

Soon, however, she gathered that no
terrible news had come  no news at all.
Don Alvar and Don Juan had ascended
the mountain with their guide Jose, and
had never returned; and, after waiting
for their descent in the early morning,
Pedro had come back without them.
What could have happened ? Their might
have gone a long way round, in fact a
three days' route  there was no other, or
they might have fallen from a precipice.
'' In short, you know nothing about
them. We must go and see," interrupted
Cherry, briefly ; " at least, 1 wilL What
mules have you ? Who is the best guide
now in Ronda? "

''My dear boy," said Mr. Stanford
gently and reluctantly, " you must not try
the mountain yourself. You know it must
be done on foot, and the fatigue  "

How can I. think of that now ? What

does it matter?" said Cherry, with the
roughness of excessive pain. '* It is far
worse to wait."

Yes, but depend upon it, they are as
anxious as you are. Certainly I shall go,
and the guides ; but, you see, speed is an
object."

'' Oh, I shouldn't cough and lose my
breath now ! " said Cherry. *' Indeed, I
can walk up hill."

Mr. Stanford could hardly answer him,
and he went on vehemently, 

You know Alvar is much too fidgety ;
he thinks I can do nothing. But, at
least, let us all ride to the foot of the
mountain; perhaps we shall meet them
yet."

'eyes, that at any rate we will do. Grive
your orders, and then come and get some
chocolate."

Miss Weston had taken care that this
was ready, and Cherry sat down and ate
and drank, trying to put a good face on
the matter before the ladies.

After they started on their ride he was

very silent, and hardly spoke a word till
they came to the little inn where the
mules had been left the day before. Then
he said very quietly to Mr. Stanford, 

Perhaps I had better wait  I might
hinder you."

"I think it would be best," said Mr.
Stanford, with merciful absence of comment,
for he knew what the sense of incapacity
must have been to Cherry then.

The kindest thing was to start on the
steep ascent at once. Miss Weston, in
what Gipsy thought a cold-blooded manner,
took out her drawing materials, and sat
down to sketch the mountain peaks,
Cheriton started from his silent watch of
the ascending party, and asked Gipsy to take
a little walk with him : and as she gladly
came, they gathered plants and talked a
little about the view, showing their
terror by their utter silence on the real
object of their thoughts. Then he exerted
himself to get some lunch for them; so
that the first hours of the day passed pretty
well. But as the afternoon wore on, he

sat down under a great walnut-tree, and
watched the mountain  the great pitiless
creature with its steep bare sides and
snow J summits. He gave no outward
sign of impatience, only watched as if he
could not turn his eyes away ; and Miss
Weston, almost as anxious for him as for
the missing ones, thought it best to leave
him to follow his own bent.

No one was anxious about poor Gipsy,
who wandered about, running out of sight
in the vain hope of seeing something on
the bare hill-side on her return.

At last, just as the wonderful violet and
rose tints of the sunset began to colour
the white peaks, Cheriton sprang to his
feet, and pointed to the hill-side, where,
far in the distance, were moving figures.

"How many?" he said, for, in the
hurry of their start, they had left the
field-glasses, which would have brought
certainty a little sooner, behind.

"Oh, there are surely a great manj,"
said Gipsy.

Cheriton watched with the keen sig-sit

trained on his native moorlands ; while
the ladies counted and miscounted, and
thought they saw Jack's white surgery.

Neo," said Cherry, '' there are only Mr.
Stanford and the two guides. I cannot
wait." he added, impetuously, and began
to hurry up the hill, till he stopped perforce
for want of breath.

'' There can have been no accident ; we
have found no one  nothing whatever,"
cried Mr. Stanford, as soon as he came
within speaking distance. '* They must
have gone the other way ; there is no
trace."

He spoke in a tone of would-be congratulation,
but an ominous whisper passed
among the guides, haiididas, and the utter
blank was almost more terrifying than
direct ill news.

'' We must go back to Ronda, and see
what can be done tomorrow."

But," said Cherry, rather incoherently,
I don't know  you see, I must take
care of Jack."

"Yes," said Mr. Stanford, ' but any

little detention would not hurt either of
them, and they must not find that you are
knocked up. We can consult the authorities
at Ronda."

"Yes, thank you; I hope you are not
over-tired," said Cherry, half dreamily.
'' I ? oh, no; I am quite well; but I can't
help being anxious."

''No, it is very perplexing; but I feel
quite hopeful of good news myself," said
Mr. Stanford.

But somehow the necessity of this assurance
struck a sharper pang to Cherry's
heart than his own vague forebodings.

CIVIS ROM ANUS SUM.

The mightiest of all peoples under Heaven ! "

'* I TELL you, you stupid, blundering blockheads,
that he is my brother ; and we are
Englishmen, and we know nothing whatever
of your Carlist brigands, or whoever they are !
We are British subjects, and you had better
let us go, or the British Government will
know the reason why," thundered Jack
Lester, in exceedingly bad Spanish, interspersed
with English epithets, at the top of
his voice.

*' Gentlemen, it is true ; our passports are

VOL. Til. B

deronda; conduct us thither, if you will.
We are travelling for pleasure only, and have
no concern with any political matters at all,"
said Alvar, in far more courteous accents.

The scene was the mountain side, the time
evening, and Alvar and Jack were just beginning
their descent, when they were confronted
by an official, and surrounded by a
small troop of soldiers in the government
uniform. They had been suddenly encountered
and stopped, and desired to produce
their passports, and, these not being forthcoming,
their account of themselves was met
with civil incredulity, and they were desired
to consider themselves under arrest.

*but  but don't you see that you're
making an utter fool of yourself," shouted
Jack, in a fury. '' I tell you this gentleman
is my brother, and we are the sons of Mr.
Lester, of Oakby Hall, Westmoreland, and
have nothing to do with your confounded
Casts. I'll knock the first fellow down  "

*hush, Jack! Keep your temper," whispered

Alvar, in English. ** Sen or, I am the
grandson of Senor Don Guzman de la Rosa,
of Seville, well known as a friend to the
government, and this is my half-brother from
England."

' One of the De la Eosas, senor, is exactly
what we know you to be ; but as for this
extraordinary falsehood by which you call
yourself an Englishman  and the brother of
this gentleman  why, you make matters
worse for yourselves for attempting it."

'' Ask the guide," said Alvar.

"Ah, doubtless; the fellow was known as
having been engaged in the late war. Come,
sen ores, you may as well accompany me in
silence."

'* Will you send a message by the direct
route to Eonda, asking for our passports,
and informing our friends of our safety ? "
said Alvar.

No, informing their friends was the last
thing wished for. In the morning they
would see.

B 2

'' Do not resist, Jack," said Alvar ; ' it is
quite useless ; we must come."

'' Don't you hear he is talking English tome
? " said Jack, as a last appeal, and, of
course, a vain one.

I am sure they haven't got a magistrate's
warrant," said Jack, as his alpenstock was
taken away from him, and, closely guarded,
he was made to precede Alvar down the hill,
in a state of offended dignity and incredulous
indignation . He was very angry, hut not at all
frightened ; it was incredible that any Spanish
officials should hurt him. Indeed, as he
cooled down a little, the adventure might
have been a good joke, but for the certainty
that Cherry would be imagining them at the
bottom of a precipice.

After walking for some way along a
different road from the one they had come
by, they stopped at a little wayside tavern,
where they were given to understand that
they were to pass the night.

' But it's impossible; they can't keep us

here," cried Jack. ' Isn't there a parish
priest, or a magistrate, or a policeman, or
some one to appeal to ? "

''No one who could help us," answered
Alvar. " I do not think there is anything
to be afraid of for ourselves ; we can easily
prove that we are English when we get to
some town ; it is of Cherry that I think  he
will be so frightened."

You don't think they'll go and take him
up?"

Oh, no ; I hope they will send to Eonda
for our passports in the morning. But, Jack,
do not fly in a passion. We must be very
civil, and say we are quite willing to be
detained in the service of the government."


"I'm hanged if I say anything of the
sort," muttered Jack, whose prominent sensation
was rage at the idea that he, an
Englishman, a gentleman, a man with an
address, and a card  though he had unluckily
left it at home  should be subjected to such

an indignity, stopped in his proceedings by a
dozen trumpery Spaniards !

Alvar was not so full of a sense of the
liberty of the subject ; he felt sure that he
was mistaken for Manoel, and more than
suspected that the government might have
been justified in detaining his cousin. He
did not, however, wish to confide this to
Jack, of whose prudence he was doubtful,
and knew that if the worst came to the
worst, his grandfather could get them out of
the scrape.

There might be no danger, but it was very
uncomfortable, and provisions being scarce
in the emergency, the captain  who looked
much more like a bandit than an officer 
gave his prisoners no supper but a bit of
bread. Alvar was Spaniard enough to endure
the fasting, but Jack, after his day of mountain
climbing, was ready to eat his fingers
off with hunger; and as the hours wore on,
began really to feel sick, wretched, and low-spirited,
and though he preserved an unmoved

demeanour, to wonder inwardly what
his father would say if he knew where he
was, and to remember that the Spaniards
were a cruel people and invented the Inquisition
! And then he wondered if Gipsy was
thinking of him.

Moreover, it was very cold, and they were
of course tired to begin with, so that, when
at length the morning dawned, Alvar was
startled to see how like Jack looked to
Cheriton after a bad night, and made such
representations to the captain that Englishmen
could not bear cold and hunger, that he
obtained a fair share of bread and a couple
of onionspro visions which " Jack enjoyed
more than he would have done had he
guessed what Alvar had said to procure
them.

' I'm up to anything now," he said. * If
they would only let us put a note in the post
for Cherry, it would be rather a lark after
all."

*'I do not know where you will find a

post-offices' said Alvar disconsolately, as
they were marched off in an opposite direction
to Konda. '' If Cherry only does not climb
that mountain to look for us ! "

I should like to set this country to
rights a little," said Jack.

' That," said Alvar dryly, 'ris what
many have tried to do, but they have not
succeeded."

The prisoners were very well guarded, and
though Alvar made more than one attempt
to converse with the captain, he got scarcely
any answer. Still, from the exceedingly
curious glances with which he regarded them,
Alvar suspected that he was not quite clear
in his own mind as to their identity. After
a long day's march they struck down on a
small Moorish-looking town, called Sahara,
built beside a wide, quick-rushing river.

And now Alvar's hopes rose, as here resided
an acquaintance of his grandfather, a noted
breeder of bulls, who knew him well, and had
once seen Cheriton at Seville. Besides, the

authorities of Sahara might be amenable to
reason.

However, they could get no hearing that
night, and were shut up in what Jack called
the station-house, but which was really a
round Moorish tower with horseshoe arches.
Here Alvar obtained a piece of paper, and
they concocted a full description of themselves,
their travelling companions, and their
destination, which Alvar signed with his full
name, 

"Alvaro Guzman Lester,

Of Westmoreland, England 

and directed to El Senor Don Luis Pavieco,
Sahara, and this he desired might be given
to the local authorities. He also tried
hard, but in vain, to get a note sent to
Eonda.

They hoped that the early morning might
produce Don Luis, but they saw nothing of
any one but the soldier who brought them
their food, which was still of the poorest.

Alvar's patience began to give way at last ;
he walked up and down the room.

"Oh, I am mad when I think of my
brother! " he exclaimed. *' My poor Cheriton.
What he will suffer ! "

"Don't you think they'll let us out
soon ? " said Jack, who had subsided into a
sort of glum despair.

Oh, they will wait  and delay  and
linger. It drives me mad ! " he repeated
vehemently, and throwing himself into a
seat he hid his face in his arms on the table.

"Well," said Jack, " it's dogged as does
it. I wish I hadn't used up all my tobacco
though."

Early the next morning their door was
opened at an unusual hour, and they were
summoned into a sort of hall, where they
found "el Capitan," another officer in a
respectable uniform, and, to Alvar's joy, Don
Luis Pavieco himself.

The thing was ended with ludicrous ease.
Don Luis bowed to Alvar, and turning to the

officer declared that Don Alvar Lester was
perfectly well known to him, and that the
other gentleman was certainly his half-brother
and an Englishman. The officer bowed also,
smiled, hoped that they had not been incommoded;
it was a slight mistake.

 ' Mistake ! ' ' exclaimed Jack ;  ' and pray,
Alvar, what's the Spanish for apology 
damages ?"

Alvar tm-ned a deaf ear, and bowed and
smiled with equal politeness.

' He had been sure that in due time the
slight mistake would be rectified. Were they
now free to go ? "

** Yes ; " and Don Luis interposed, begging
them to come and get some breakfast with
him while their horses could be got ready.
Their guide ?  oh, he was still detained on
suspicion.

*' Well," ejaculated Jack, Hhey are the
coolest hands. Incommoded ! I should
think we have been incommoded indeed ! "

In the meantime no hint of how matters

had really gone reached the anxious hearts
at Ronda. The authorities had scouted the
idea of brigands, and had revealed the
existence of a dangerous ravine, some short
distance from the mountain path. Doubtless
the darkness had overtaken them, and they
had been lost. The guides declared that
nothing was more unlikely, as it was hardly
possible to reach the ravine from the path,
the rocks were so steep. A search was
however made by some of the most active, it
need not be said, in vain. Cheriton, afterwards,
never could bear a reference to those
days and nights of suspense  suspense lasting
long enough to change the hope of good
tidings into the dread of evil tidings, till he
feared rather than longed for the sounds for
which his whole being seemed to watch.

Nothing could exceed Mr. Stanford's
kindness to him, and he held up at first
bravely, and submitted to his friend's care.
On the third morning they resolved that
Don Guzman should be written to, and

Cherry, who had been wandering about in an
access of restless misery, tried to begin the
letter; but he put down the pen, turning
faint and dizzy, and unable to frame a sentence.


**I cannot," he said faintly. I cannot
see.

'you must lie down, my dear boy; you
have had no rest. I will do it'

*' My father, too," Cheriton said, with a
painful effort at self-control. *'I think 
there's no chance. I must try to do it ; but
oh  Jack  Jack ! "

He buried his face on his arms with a sob
that seemed as if it would tear him to
pieces.

*' You must not write yet to your father,"
said Mr. Stanford. ** I do not give up
hope. Courage, my boy ! "

Suddenly a loud scream rang through the
house, and an outburst of voices, and one
raised joyously, 

* My brother  my brother  are you here ?

we are safe ! " and as Cherry started to
his feet Alvar, followed by Jack, rushed into
the room, and clasped him in his arms.

' Safe! yes, the abominable, idiotic brutes
of soldiers ! But we're all right, Cherry.
You mustn't mind now."

' Yes, we are here, and it is over."

'' Thank Heaven for His great mercy ! "
cried Mr. Stanford, almost bursting into
tears as he grasped Alvar' s hand.

*' Bandits, bandits?" cried half-a-dozen
voices.

But Cherry could not speak a word ; he
only put out his hand and caught Jack's, as
if to feel sure of his presence also.

"Mi querido/' said Alvar in his gentle,
natural tones, " all the terror is over  now
you can rest. I think you had better go,
Jack. I will take care of him," he added.

'eyes," said Mr. Stanford;  this has
been far too much. Come, Jack  come and
tell us all that has chanced."

CHAPTER Xxxi.

JACK ON HIS METTLE.

Lat me alone in chasing of my wyf,
That charge upon my bak I wol endure'

CHxVUCER.

That same morning, when Jack and Alvar
had ridden hurriedly up to the hotel, looking
eagerly to catch sight of those who were so
anxiously watching for them, their eyes fell
on Gipsy's solitary figure, standing motionless,
with eyes turned towards the mountain,
and hands dropped listlessly before her.
Jack's heart gave a great bound, and at the
sound of the horses' hoofs, she turned with a
start and scream of joy, and sprang towards
them, while Jack, jumping off, caught both
her hands, crying, 

** Oh, don't be frightened any more, we're
come ! "

** Your brother!" exclaimed Gipsy, as she
flew into the house ; but her cry of ' Papa !
papa ! " was suddenly choked with such an
outburst of blinding, stifling tears and sobs,
that she paused perforce ; and as they ran
upstairs, Mariquita, the pretty Spanish girl
who waited on them, caught her hand and
kissed her fervently.

Ah, senorita, dear senorita ; thanks to
the saints, they have sent her lover back to
her. Sweet senorita, now she will not
cry!"

A sudden access of self-consciousness
seized on Gipsy ; she blushed to her fingertips,
and only anxious to hide the tears she
could not check, she hurried away, round to
the back of the inn, into a sort of orchard,
where grew peach and nectarine trees, apples
and pears already showing buds, and where
the ground was covered with jonquils and
crocuses, while beyond was the rocky precipice,

and, far off, the snowy peaks that still
made Gipsy shudder. Unconscious of the
strain she had been enduring, she was terrified
at the violence of her own emotion, for Gipsy
was not a girl who was given to gusts of
feeling. Probably the air and the solitude
were her best remedies, for she soon began
to recover herself, and sat up among the
jonquils. Oh, how thankful she was that
the danger was over, and the bright, kindly
Cheriton spared from such a terrible sorrow !
But was it for Cheriton 's sake that these last
two days had been Hke a frightful dream,
that her very existence seemed to have been
staked on news of the lost ones ? No
one  no one could help such feelings. Miss
Weston had cried about it, and her father
had never been able to touch a pencil. But
that fooHsh Mariquita ! Here Gipsy sprang
to her feet with a start, for close at her side
stood Jack. At sight of him, strong and
ruddy and safe, her feeling overpowered her
consciousness of it, and she said, earnestly, 

VOL. III. c

* Oh, I am so thankful you are safe ! It
was so dreadful ! "

'' And it was not dreadful at all m reality,
only tiresome and absurd," said Jack.

It was very dreadful here," said Gipsy,
in a low voice, with fresh tears springing.

' Oh, if you felt so!" cried Jack ardently;
'' I wish it could happen to me twenty times
over ! "

 '* Oh, never again ! " she murmured ; and
then Jack, suddenly and impetuously, 

'but I am glad it happened, for I found
out up in that dirty hole how I felt. There
was never any one like you. I  I  could
you ever get to think of me ? Oh, Gipsy, I
mean it. I love you ! " cried the boy, his
stern, thoughtful face radiant with eagerness,
as he seized her hand.

''Oh, no  you don't ! " stammered Gipsy,
not knowing what she said.

"I do!" cried Jack desperately. "I
never was a fellow that did not know his
own mind. Of course I know I'm young

yet ; but I only want to look forward. I
shall work and get on, and  and up there at
school and at Oakby I never thought there
was any one like you. I disliked girls. But
now  oh, Gipsy, won't you begin at the very
beginning with me, and let us Hve our lives
together?"

Boy as he was, there was a strength of
intention in Jack's earnest tones that carried
conviction. Perhaps the mutual attraction
might have remained hidden for long, or
even have passed away, but for the sudden
and intense excitement that had brought it
to the surface.

*' Won't you won't you?" reiterated
Jack; and Gipsy said *eyes."

They stood in the glowing sunshine, and
Jack felt a sort of ecstasy of unknown bliss.
He did not know how long was the pause
before Gipsy, starting, and as if finishing the
sentence, went on, 

** Yes but I don't know. Whatwill they'll
say ? Isn't it wrong when we are so young ? "
c 2

 Wrong! as if a year or two made any
difference to feelings like mine!" cried Jack.
*' If I were twenty-five, if I were thirty, I
couldn't love you better ! "

*eyes  but  " said Gipsy, in her quick,
practical way. ' You '6 young, and  and
papa  If he says  "

'* Of course I shall tell him'' said Jack.
** I am not going to steal you. If you will
wait, I'll work and show your father that I
am a man. For I love you ! "

*' I'll wait ! " said Gipsy softly ; and then
voices sounded near, and she started away
from him, while Jack  but Jack could never
recollect exactly what he did during the next
ten minutes, till the thought of how he was
to tell his story sobered him. Practical life
had not hitherto occupied much of Jack's
mind; he had had no distinct intentions
beyond taking honours, and if possible a
fellowship, till he had been seized upon by
this sudden passion, which in most lads
would probably have been a passing fancy,

but in so earnest and serious a nature took
at once a real and practical shape. But
when Jack thought of facing Mr. Stanford,
and still worse his own father, with his wishes
and his hopes, a fearful embarrassment seized
on him. No, he must first make his cause
good with the only person who was likely to
be listened to  he must find Cherry. However,
the first person he met was Mr.
Stanford, who innocently asked him if he
knew where his daughter was. Jack blushed
and stared, answering incoherently, 

* I was only looking for Cherry."

 There he is. I heard him asking for
you. Perhaps Gipsy is in the orchard."

Jack felt very foolish and cowardly, but
for his very life he could not begin to speak,
and he turned towards the bench where
Cherry sat in the sun, smoking his pipe
comfortably, and conscious of little but a
sense of utter rest and relief.

* Well, Jack, I haven't heard your story
yet," he said, as Jack came and sat do\vn

beside him. '' I don't think you have grown
thin, though Alvar says they nearly starved
you to death."

'' Where is Alvar ? " asked Jack.

*' I got him to go to the mayor, intendant,
whatever the official is called here, and see
if anything could he done for poor Pedro.
His mother was here just now in an agony.
Jack, I think the ' evils of government '
might receive some illustrations."

* Cheriton," said Jack, with unusual solemnity,
'i've got to ask your advice 
that is, your opinion  that is, to tell you
something."

Don't you think I should look at it from
a ludicrous point of view?" said Cherry,
whose spirits were ready for a reaction into
nonsense.

I don't know," said Jack ; " but it is very
serious. I have made up my mind. Cherry,
that I mean to marry Miss Stanford, and I
shall direct all my efforts in life to accomplish
this end. I know that I am younger than is

usual on these occasions; but such things
are not a question of time. Cherry, do help
me; they'll all Hsten to you."

Cheriton sat with his pipe in his hand, so
utterly astonished, that he allowed Jack's
sentences to come to a natural conclusion.
Then he exclaimed, 

Jack ! You ! Oh, impossible ! "

'' I don't see why you should think it
impossible. Anyhow, it's true ! "

*' But it is so sudden. Jack, my dear boy,
you're slightly carried off your head just
now. Don't say a word about it  while
we're all together at least ; it wouldn't be
fair."

'Butl have," answered Jack 'rand 
and  " in a different tone, " Cherry, I don't
know how to believe it myself, but she  it is
too wonderful  she will."

Cherry did not answer. He put his hand
on Jack's with a sudden, quick movement.
.

' I suppose you think I ought to have

waited till I had a better right to ask her,"
said Jack presently.

A look of acute pain passed over
Cheriton's face. He said doubtfully, *rare
you quite sure ? "

assure? Sure of what?"
'' Of your own mind and hers ? "
'' Did I ever not know my own mind ?
I'm not a fool ! " said Jack angrily.
' And, if you could have seen just the way
she looked. Cherry, you wouldn't have any
doubts."

'* I am afraid," said Cherry very gently,
and after a pause, * that you have been very
hasty. I don't think that father, or Mr.
Stanford either, would listen to you now."

"I want you to ask them," said Jack
insinuatingly. ' Father would do anything
for you now ; and, besides, we are young
enough to wait, and I've got the world before
me, and I mean to keep straight and get on.
Why should Mr. Stanford object ? I feel as
if I could do anything. You don't think it

would make me idle ? No, I shall work
twice as hard as I should without it."

'' Yes," said Cherry quietly; **no doubt."

Something in his tone brought recent
facts to Jack's remembrance, as was proved
by his sudden silence. Cherry looked round
at him and smiled.

"You know. Jack, I wasn't prepared to
find the schoolboy stage passed into the
lover's. I'll speak to Mr. Stanford, if that
is what you want, and even if things don't
fit in at once, if you feel as you say, you
won't be much to be pitied with such an aim
before you ! "

'' I'm not at all ashamed of telling my
own story," said Jack, 'but  "

But there is Mr. Stanford coming out of
the house, so if you mean to run away you
had better make haste about it."

Jack rose, but he paused a moment, and
as Mr. Stanford came towards them, said
bluntly, 

Mr. Stanford, I want Cheriton to tell

you about it first ; " then deliberately walked
away.

Poor Mr. Stanford, who had little expected
such an ending to his tour with his favourite
little daughter, was feeling himself in a
worse scrape than the lovers, and though he
had romance enough to sympathize with
them, was disposed to be angry with Jack
for his inconsiderate haste, and to feel that
*' What will your mother say ? " was a more
uncomfortable question to himself than to
his daughter.

Cheriton, on his side, would have been
very glad of a few minutes for reflection, but
Mr. Stanford began at once, 

' I see I have not brought news to you."

*' No," said Cherry. 'Jack has been
talking to me ; I had no idea of such a
thing. But, Mr. Stanford, there is no
doubt that Jack is thoroughly in earnest," asa
half smile twinkled on the artist's perplexed
countenance.

'sin earnest, yes; but what business has

he to be in earnest ? What would your
father say to such a proceeding ? What
can he say at your brother's age, and of
people of whom he knows nothing, and of
a connexion of which, knowing nothing, he
probably would not approve ?"

Cheriton blushed, knowing that this last
assertion contained much truth.

*but he does know," he said, of all
your kindness, and he will know more  and
and wien he knows you, he could not
think"

Excuse me, my dear fellow, but he will
think. He will think I have thrown my
daughter in the way of his sons  for which
I have only my own imprudence, I suppose,
to thank. And he would no doubt dislike a
connexion the advantages of which, whatever
they may be, are not enumerated in Burke's
Landed Gentry.' "

Mr. Stanford smiled, though he spoke
with a certain spirited dignity, and Cheriton
could not contradict him ; for though Mr.

Stanford had not risen out of any romantic
obscurity, he certainly owed his present
position to his own genius and high personal
character. He had himself married welland
all would depend on the way in which it
was put to a man like Mr. Lester, slow to
realize unfamiliar facts. Cheriton could not
take the liberty of saying that he thought
such an objection would be groundless, or at
least easily overcome ; but he was afraid that
his silence might be misconstrued, and said, 

*' But on your side, Mr. Stanford, would
you think it wrong to give Jack a little hope ?
I think he has every prospect of success in
life. And he is a very good fellow. Sudden
as this is, I feel sure that he will stick to it."

*As to that," said Mr. Stanford, '' I like
Jack very well, and for my part I think
young people are all the better for having to
fight their way ; but whatever may take place
in the future I can allow no intercourse till
your father's consent is obtained. That
will give a chance of testing their feelings on

both sides. Gipsy is a mere child, she may
not understand herself."

*I think," said Cheriton, "that if Jack
writes to my father now, or speaks to him
when he gets home, that no one will attend
to him. But if it could wait till we all
go back, I could explain the circumstances
so much better. It is always difficult to
take in what passes at a distance."

"Well," said Mr. Stanford, "all I have
to say is that when Jack applies to me, with
his father's consent, I will hear what he has
to say, not before. Come, Cheriton," he
added, " you know there is no other way of
acting. This foolish boy has broken up our
pleasant party, and upset all our plans."

"Perhaps I ought to have made more
apologies for him," said Cherry, with a smile.
But I want things to go well with Jack.
It would be so bad for him to have a disappointment
of that kind just as he is making
his start in life."

Mr. Stanford noticed the unconscious

emphasis, ''I want things to go well with
Jack," and said kindly, * Jack couldn't have
a letter special pleader, and if he has as
much stuff in him as I think, a few obstacles
won't hurt him."

' Oh, Jack has plenty of good strong stuff
in him, mental, moral  and physical, too,"
added Cherry hurriedly.
 Mr. Stanford was touched by the allusion,
which was evidently intended to combat a
possible latent objection on his part.

'* Jack is excellent  but inconvenient," he
said, thinking it better not to make the
subject too serious. '' The thing is what todo
next." As he spoke. Jack himself came
up to them, and Mr. Stanford prevented his
first words with, ''My dear fellow, I have
said my say to your brother, and I don't
mean to listen to yours just yet."

'' I believe, sir," said Jack, '* that I  I
have not observed sufficient formalities. I
shall go straight home to my father, and I
hope to obtain his full consent. But it is

due to me to let me say that my mind is,
and always will be, quite unalterable. And
I'm not sorry I spoke, sir  I can't be ! "

No," said Mr. Stanford;  but I must
desire that you make no further attempt at
present."

I hope, Mr. Stanford, that you don't
imagine I would attempt anything underhand
! " cried Jack impetuously.

** I shall have every confidence in you,"
said Mr. Stanford gravely ; '' but remember,
I cannot regard you as pledged to my
daughter by anything that has passed to-day."

Jack made no answer, but he closed his
lips with an expression of determination.

When Alvar came back, having succeeded
in instituting an inquiry into the merits of
Pedro's character, there was a discussion of
plans, which ended in the three brothers
agreeing to go by the shortest route to
Seville, whence Jack could at once start for
England ; while the Stanforths followed them
by a longer and more picturesque road, and

after picking up their own property, would
also go home via Madrid some week or two
later. Alvar was not nearly so much
astonished as the others, nor so much
concerned.

'' It was natural," he said, " since Jack's
heart was not preoccupied, and would doubtless
pass away with absence."

Jack was so excessively indignant that he
did not condescend to a reply, only asking
Cherry if he was too tired to start at once.

This proposal, however, was negatived by
Mr. Stanford, who remarked that he did
not want to hear of any more adventures in
the dusk; and it was agreed that both parties
should start early on the following morning.
In the meantime the only rational thing was
to behave as usual. Jack was, however,
speechless and surly with embarrassment,
and stuck to Cheriton as if he was afraid to
lose sight of him ; while Gipsy bore herself
with a transparent affectation of unconsciousness,
and, though she blushed at every look.

coined little remarks at intervals. Miss
Weston kindly professed to be seized with a
desire to inspect the Dominican Convent,
and carried her and Alvar off for that
purpose ; while Jack held by Cherry, who
was glad to rest, though this starting
incident had one good effect, in driving away
all the haunting memories of the late alarm.

The next morning all were up with the
sun, Gipsy busily dispensing the chocolate
and pressing it on Cheriton as he sat at the
table. Suddenly she turned, and, with a
very pretty gesture, half confident, half shy,
she held up a cup to Jack, who stood behind.

'' Won't you have some?" she said, with a
hint of her own mischief in her eyes and
voice. Jack seized the cup, and  upset it
over the deft, quick hands that tendered it to
him.

' Oh, I have burnt you ! " he exclaimed, in
so tragic a voice that all present burst out
laughing.

*'No," said Gipsy, 'nearly morning chocolate

TOL. III. D

is not dangerously hot; but you have spoiled
my cuffs, and spilled it, and I don't think
there's any more of it."

' Jack's first attention!" said Cherry, under
his breath ; but he jumped up and followed
Alvar, who had gone to see about the mount
provided for them. Miss Weston was tying
various little bags on to her saddle.

''I say, Mr. Stanford," called Cherry,
 there's such a picturesque mule here; do
come and see it."

He looked up with eyes full of mischievous
entreaty as Mr. Stanford obeyed his call.
'well," said the latter with a smile, ''I may
ask you to come and see me at Kensington,
for I must get the picture finished."

'' That was a much prettier picture, just
now," said Cheriton ; 'rand I'm sure Jack
would be happy to sit for it any time."

When Gipsy, long afterwards, was pressed
on the subject of that little parting interview,
she declared that Jack had done nothing but
say that he wouldn't make love to her on any

account; but however that might be, she
soon came running out, rosy and bashful ;
while Cheriton put her on her mule and gave
her a friendly hand-squeeze and a look of all
possible encouragement. Mr. Stanford went
into the house and called Jack to bid him
a kind farewell. After the party had set off,
Gipsy looked back and saw the crowd of mule
drivers and peasants, the host and hostess,
with Mariquita kissing her hands, and the
three brothers standing together in the
morning sunshine, waving their farewells.
As they passed out of sight, her father
touched her hand and made her ride up close
to his side.

'My little girl," he said, *this is a serious
thing that has come to you; I do not know
how it may end for you. I am sure that it
will bring you anxiety and delay. Be honest
with yourself, and do not exaggerate the
romance and excitement of these last few
days into a feeling which may demand from
you much sacrifice."

D 2

Gipsy had never heard her father speak in
this tone before  she was awed and silenced.

** Be honest," repeated her father, ** for I
think it is a very honest heart that you have
won."

*' Papa," said Gipsy, * I am honest, and I
think I know what you mean. But I don't
mind waiting if I know he is waiting too.
He said  begin at the beginning' with him."

sewell," said Mr. Stanford with a sigh,
' Che sard sard;" but with a sudden turn,
' He is young, too, you know, and many
things may happen to change his views."

'' I cannot help it now, papa," said Gipsy,
who felt that those days and nights of terror
had developed her feelings more than weeks
of common life. She gave her father's hand
a little squeeze, and looked up in his face
with the tears on her black eyelashes. She
meant to say, *'I love you all the better
because of this new love which has made
everything deeper and warmer for me," but
all she managed to say was  ** There !

There are all the things tumbling out of
your knapsack ! I'm not going to have that
happen again even if  if  whatever should
take place in the future."

** I hope, my dear, that nothing more will
happen, at least till we are at home again,"
said Mr. Stanford meekly ; but Gipsy put
the things into the knapsack, and after a
little silence they fell into a conversation on
the scenery as naturally as possible.

CHAPTER XXXV.

A SUMMONS.

'' Once from high Heaven
Is a father given.
Once  and, oh, never again!"

After Jack returned home, with the understanding
that the disclosure of his hoHday
occupation should await his brother's return,
and after the Stanforths had also left Seville,
Alvar and Cheriton spent several weeks there
without any adventures to disturb their
tranquillity. Alvar was a good deal with his
grandfather, whose health was not at this
time good, but who had evinced great
curiosity as to the details of their detention
on the mountains. He used also to go to

the different clubs and meet acquaintances,
where they talked politics and scandal, and
played at cards, dominoes, and billiards. It
was an aimless existence, and Cheriton
sometimes fancied that Alvar grew restless
under it, and would not be sorry to return to
England. This, however, might have been
owing to Cheriton 's own decided dislike to
the young Villanous, who struck him as
almost justifying his grandmother's preconceived
theory of Alvar' s probable behaviour.


**Ah, they do not suit you, that is not
what you like," Alvar said cheerfully; but he
never said, * It is not good, this sort of life
does not make a nation great or virtuous."

Manoel was of another type, and perhaps
a more respectable one ; but they saw very
little of him. Cheriton liked the ladies, who
were kind, and possessed many domestic
virtues ; and at Don Guzman's country
place there was something exceedingly
pleasant in the cheerfulness and gaiety of

the peasants. He would have Heed to have
found out something of the working of the
Church, of the views of the clergy, and how
far they differed, not only from those of an
Anglican, but of an intelligent Roman priest
in more civilized countries, but on these
subjects no one would talk to him. He
heard muttering of hatred towards the
priests in some quarters, and a good deal of
chatter about processions and ceremonies
from the young ladies, but nothing further.
He did not want for occupation. He could
now read and speak Spanish easily; and
although the Cid, Ferdinand and Isabella,
the Armada, and the Inquisition had been
about the only salient points in his mind
previously, he made a study of Spanish
history, without much increase of his admiration
for the Spaniards. He was able, also,
to do much more sight-seeing than at first,
and of the cathedral he never tired, and
never came to the end of its innumerable
chapels, each with some great picture, which

Mr. Stanford had taught him how to see ;
never ceased to find something new in the
mystery and solemnity of its aisles with their
glory of coloured lights.

These quiet weeks formed a sort of resting-place,
during which he was able to think
both of the past and of the future ; he could
dare now to look away from the immediate
present. Cheriton's eyes were very
clear, his moral sense very keen, and he saw
that he had been under a delusion, that Ruth
and he were as the poles asunder, that her
deliberate deception, her want of any sense
of honour, had marked a nature that never
could have satisfied his. Love in his case
was no longer blind, but it was none the less
passionate, and, whatever else life might
hold for him, the memory of all his first, best
hopes could never bring him anything but
pain. This pain had been as much as he
could bear, but others, he thought, had
suffered as keenly, and had led lives that
were neither ignoble nor unhappy. Because

one great love had gone out of his life was
nothing else worthy or dear?  Nothing"
had been the answer of his first anguish, but
Cheriton's nature was too rich in love for
such an answer to stand. The help for
which he had prayed had been sent to him,
and it came in the sense that home faces
were still dear  homo dear his late alarm had
taught him  home duties still paramount,
that he could be a good son and brother and
friend still. And he thought with a sort of
surprise of the many pleasant and not unhappy
hours he had passed of late ; how
much, after all, he had ' enjoyed himself."
He hardly knew that his quick intelligence
was a gift to be thankful for, or that his
unselfish interest in others brought its own
reward. On another side of his nature, also,
he resisted the aimlessness of his lost hopes.
The thought of Ruth had sweetened his
success at Oxford, but he would not be such
a coward as to give up all his objects in life,
he would make a name for himself still, and

show her that she had not brought him to
utter shipwreck. This motive was strong in
Cheriton, though it ran alongside with much
higher ones.

One picture in the cathedral exercised a
great fascination over Cheriton's mind. It
hangs in the Capella del Consult, over a side
altar, dedicated to the Angel de la Guard,
and is one of the many masterpieces of
Murillo to be found in Seville. It represents
a tall, strong angel with wide-spread wings,
and grave, benevolent face, leading by the
hand a child  a subject which has been of
course repeated in every form of commonplace
prettiness. But in this picture the
figure of the angel conveys a sense of
heavenly might and unearthly guardianship
which no imitation or repetition could give.
It is called the * Guardian Angel;" but
Cheriton had been told by one of the priests
that the name given to it by the painter
himself was 'the Soul and the Church,"
which for some reason or other had been

changed by the monks of the Capuchin Convent,
to whom the picture had originally
belonged. It was a thought and a carrying
out of the thought which, seen among such
surroundings, was full of suggestion, how
and why that Divine Guidance seemed herein
great measure to have gone astray, how
the great angel's finger had not always
pointed upward, and yet how utterly helpless
and rudderless the nation was when it
cast off the Guide of its fathers. Then his
thoughts turned to his own life and to the
Hand that held it, to the Guidance that was
sometimes so hard to recognize, so difficult
to yield to, and yet how the sense of a love
and a wisdom above his own, speaking to
him, whether in the events of his own life,
the better impulses of his own heart, or in
the visible forms of religion, was the one
light in the darkness.

*' O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone."

As he murmured the words half aloud a

hand touched his shoulder. He looked up
and saw Alvar standing beside him.

 Mi qiierido, I have been looking for you.
Will you come home? I want you," he
said.

'' There is something the matter," said
Cheriton quickly, as he looked at him.
' What is it?"

*' Ah, I must tell you ! " said Alvar reluctantly.
' It is bad news, indeed. Sit down
again  here  I have received this." He
took a telegraph paper out of his pocket and
put it into Cherry's hand.

Mrs. Lester to Alvar Lester.

"Your father has met with a dangerous
accident. He wishes to see you. Come
home at once. He desires Cheriton to run
no risk."

Cheriton looked up blankly for a moment,
then started to his feet, crushing up the
paper in his hand.

* Quick," he said, " we must go at once.
When ? By Madrid is the shortest way."

' Yes  I  " said Alvar; 'but see what
he says."

''I must go," said Cheriton. 'don't
waste any words about it. I know he wants
me. I'll be careful enough, only make
haste."

But he paused, and dropping on his knees
on the altar step, covered his face with his
hands, rose, and silently led the way out of
the cathedral.

Alvar, with his usual tact, perceived at
once that it would be impossible to persuade
him to stay behind, and did not fret him by
the attempt, though this hasty journey and
the return to Oakby in the first sharp winds
of March were more on his own mind than
the thought of what news might meet them
at the journey's end.

It was still early in the day, and they
were able to start within a few hours, only
taking a few of their things with them, amid

a confusion of tears, sympathy, and regret ;
Don Guzman evidently parting from Alvar
with reluctance, and bestowing a tremendous
embrace on Cheriton in return for his thanks
for the kindness that had been shown to
him. Manoel, on the other hand, was evidently
relieved at their early departure.

Some days later, on a wild, blustering
morning in the first week of March, Jack
Lester stood on the step of the front door of
Oakby. The trees were still bare, and
scarcely a primrose peeped through the dead
leaves beneath them ; pale rays of sun were
struggling with the quick driven clouds, the
noisy caw of the rooks mingled with the
rustle of the leafless branches. Jack was
pale and heavy-eyed. He looked across the
wide, wild landscape as if its very familiarity
were strange to him, then started, as up the
park from a side entrance came a carriage
and pair as fast as it could be driven, and in
another minute pulled up at the door.

*' Oh, Cherry, we have never dared to

wish for you ! " cried Jack, as Cheriton
sprang out and caught both his hands.
 Come in  come in ! Oh, if you had hut
come last night ! "

' Not too late  not too late altogether ? "

Jack shook his head, his voice choked, but
they knew too well what he would tell them,
and the two brothers stood just within the
door, holding by each other. Jack sobbing
with relief from the strain of responsibility
and loneliness, and Cheriton dazed and
silent, unable to utter a word.

The servants began to gather round them.

* Oh, Mr. Cheriton, it's some comfort to
see you back, sir ! " said the butler ; and 
'thank heaven, sir, you're come to help
your poor grandmother!" cried the old
housekeeper; while Nettie, flying downstairs,
threw herself into Cheriton's arms, as if they
were a refuge from the agony of new and
most forlorn sorrow, while he held her fast
with long speechless kisses.

Alvar stood still. In that instinctive

mutual clinging in the first shock of their
common grief he had no share, and for the
moment he stood as much a stranger among
them as when, more than a year before, he
had come into the midst of their Christmas
merry-making, and had silenced their laughter
by his unwelcome presence.

Jack was the first to awaken to a sense of
present necessity.

'you have been travelling all night," he
said. 'come and sit down  you must be
tired out."

"We had some breakfast at Hazelbyby,
while we waited for the carriage," said
Alvar ; and Cherry, as Nettie released her
hold, unfastened his wraps, and moved over
to the hall fire, sitting down in the great
chair, as they began to exchange question
and answer.

What happened  how was it ? "

*' Didn't you get my telegram ? " said
Jack.

No ; only granny's. Where is she ? "

VOL. III. E

*' Asleep, I hope. The meet was at
Ashrigg, and old Eob fell in taking the
brook, just by Fletcher's farm. And so  so
he was thrown, and it was an injury to the
spine ; but he was quite conscious, and sent
that telegram to Alvar. After that he didn't
often know us  till  till last night. And it
was over before eleven. We did not think
you could possibly get here till to-night, and
we had no news of you, so I telegraphed
again as soon as I got home ; but I suppose
you missed the message."

' We wrote and telegraphed from Madrid,"
said Alvar; 'rit is quite possible that there
should be delay there ; and in Paris and
London we had hardly a moment to catch
the trains. Cherry has been too anxious to
feel the fatigue, but he must rest now."

*' There must be a great many things to
attend to," said Cheriton, standing up, and
passing his hand over his eyes as if he
were rousing himself out of an unnatural
dream.

*not yet," said Jack, *sit is so early.
Mr. Ellesmere will come back by-and-by."



Cherry looked round. He noticed that a
pair of antlers had been removed from one
of the panels, and an impulse came to him
to ask why, and then the oddest sense of the
incongruity of the remark. He rather knew
than felt the truth of the blow that had fallen
on them, and all the different aspects of this
great change, even to remote particulars,
passed over his mind, as over the mind
of a drowning man, but as thoughts,
not as realities. Suddenly there was a
bark and a scutter, and Buffer, in an
ecstasy of incongruous joy, rushed into the
hall, jumped upon him, yelping, licking,
dancing, and writhing with rapture. He
was followed by KoUa, who came slowly in,
and laid his great tawny head on his master's
knee, looking sorrowfully up in his face as
much as to say that he knew well enough
that this was like no other home-coming.
E 2

Cheriton started up and pushed them all
aside. He walked away to the window and
stared out at the park, into the library and
looked round it, evidently hardly knowing
what he was about. Alvar, who had been
standing pale and silent, roused himself too,
and followed him, putting his arm over his
shoulder.

"Come," he said ; "come upstairs. Jack,
where is there a fire ? "

Cheriton yielded - instinctively to Alvar's
hand and voice, and Jack led them upstairs,
saying that granny had insisted on their
rooms being kept ready for them. Nettie
withheld Buffer from following them, and
crouched down on the rug by the hall fire
till Jack returned to her.

They have both gone to bed for a little
while," he said; "even Alvar is tired out.
Nettie, you had better go to granny, as
soon as she is awake, and tell her that
they are here, and that Cherry is pretty
well."

' I suppose Cherry will tell us what todo,"
said Nettie, as she stood up.

Discipline and absence from home had
improved Nettie ; she was less childish and
more considerate, remembering to tell Jack
that he had had no breakfast, and to order
some to be ready when the travellers should
want it.

Bob, who had been sent for a day or two
before, now joined them. He had grown as
tall as Jack, but grief and awe gave him a
heavy, sullen look, and indeed they said very
little to each other. Jack wrote a few
necessary letters, and sent them off by one
of the grooms, and telegraphed to Judge
Cheriton, who was coming that same evening,
the news of what he would find. But their
father had been so completely manager and
master, that Jack felt as if giving an order
himself where unjustifiable, and as soon as he
dared, he went to see if Cherry were able to
talk to him.

'' Come, Jack," said Cherry, as the boy

came uip to him; 'come now, and tell me
everything."

Jack leaned against the foot of the bed,
and in the half darkened room told all the
details of the last few days. There had not
been much suffering, nor long intervals of
consciousness, so far as they knew. Cherry
could have done no good till last night.
Granny had done all the nursing. ' I never
thought," said Jack, ' she loved any one so
much." Mr. Ellesmere had been everything
to them, and had written letters and
told them what to do. 'but last night
father came more to himself, and sent for
Mr. Ellesmere, and presently he fetched me,
and father took hold of my hand, and said tome
quite clearly, ' Remember, your eldest
brother will stand in my place ; let there be
no divisions among you.' And then  then
he told me to try and keep Bob straight, and
that I had been a good lad. But oh. Cherry,
if he had but known about Gipsy ! But I
couldn't say one word then. And then Mr.

Ellesmere said, ' Shall Jack say anything to
Cherry for you ? ' And he smiled, and said,

My love and blessing, for he has been the
light of my eyes.' And then he sent for
Bob and Nettie, and sent messages to old
Wilson and some of the servants. And he
said that he had tried to do his duty in life
by his children and neighbours, but that he
had often failed, especially in one respect,
and also he had not ruled his temper as a
Christian man should ; and he asked everyone
to forgive him, and specially the vicar,
if he had overstepped the bounds his position
gave him ; Mr. Ellesmere said something of

thanks for years of kindness,' And then 
we had the communion. And after a bit he
said very low, ' If my boy should live, I know
he will keep things together.' Then I think
he murmured something about  about your
coming  and the cold weather  and 
and  you were not to fret  it was only
waiting a little longer. And then quite
quite loud he said, * Fear God, and keep His

commandments,' and then just whispered,

Fanny.' That was the last word; but he
lived till eleven. And poor granny, she
broke down into dreadful crying, and said,

The light of my eyes  the light of imp eyes
is darkened.' Nettie was very good with
her ; but at last we all got to bed  and  oh,
Cherry, it isn't quite so bad now we have
you ! " and Jack pressed up to his side.

Cheriton had listened to all this long,
faltering tale leaning on bis elbow, his wide
open eyes fixed on his brother, without interrupting
him by a word. Jack cried, and
he put his arm round his neck, and said,
** Poor boy ! " but no tears came to him.

' I never thought  " said Jack, whose
natural reserve was dispelled by stress of
feeling, ' I never thought what a good man
he was, and how much he cared."

'' Yes, he loved goodness," said Cherry,
with a heavy sigh.

It was true. With some prejudices and
many weaknesses, Gerald Lester had set his

duty first ; he had lived such a Hfe that those
around him were the better for his existence,
he had left a place empty and a work to be
done. Who would fill the place  how would
the work be done ?

Through all the crush of personal grief,
his two sons could not but ask themselves
this question ; but they could not bring
themselves to speak of it to each other ; and
after a few minutes Cheriton said, " I think
I will get up now. We must talk things over
together ; and I want to see granny."

*' If you have rested."

"Oh, yes, as much as is possible. I am
quite well, indeed. Go down, my boy. I
will come directly."

Jack went with a lightened heart. If
Cherry were well and able to take the lead
among them, everything could be borne.
When Cheriton came into the library he
found that Alvar had already appeared, and
was eating some breakfast, for it was still
only twelve o'clock, while Mr. Ellesmerewas

standing by the fire. The vicar greeted him
kindly and quietly, and Alvar poured out
some coffee for him ; and then Mr. Ellesmere
began to explain some of the arrangements
he had been obliged to make, and
that he had sent to their father's solicitor,
Mr. Malcolm, to come in the afternoon.
Cheriton thanked him, and asked a few
questions ; but Alvar did not seem to take
the conversation to himself, till the butler,
having taken away the breakfast things,
paused, and after looking first at Cheriton,
turned to Alvar, and said rather awkwardly, 

''Do you expect the judge by the five
o'clock train, sir, and shall the carriage be
sent to Hazelbyby to meet him ? "

There was a moment's silence, the three
younger brothers coloured to their very hair
roots, and Cheriton made a half step away
from Alvar's side. The sudden pang that
shot through him by its very sharpness
brought its own remedy. He put his hand
on Alvar's arm as if to call his attention.

'* The train comes in at five  we had
better send, hadn't we ? " he said.

'' Oh, yes ! " said Alvar.

He had grown a little pale, and he turned
his large black eyes on Cheriton with a look
half-proud, half appealing, and so sad as to
drown all Cheriton" s momentary shrinking
in self-reproach.

"Alvar," said Mr. Ellesmere, "if you
will come with me, I have a message for you
from your father."

He led the way into Mr. Lester's study,
and Alvar followed him to the room, of
which his last vivid recollection was of the
painful dispute after the breach of his engagement.
He stood by the fire in silence, and
the vicar said, 

Alvar, your father desired me to tell you
that, of all the actions of his life he most
regretted the neglect which for so many
years he showed you. He bid me say that
on his death-bed he desired his son's forgiveness."


'* My father made me every amends in his
power," said Alvar, in a low voice.

*'He commended yom grandmother and
your sister to your protection and kindness ;
your brothers also, and thought thankfully of
all that you and Cherry have become to each
other."

Alvar was much agitated, for some moments
he was unable to speak, then he said
vehemently, 

** This is my inheritance, as it was my
father's; but to my brothers I seem an
interloper. This is the wrong my father
did to me, he made me a stranger in my
own place."

* It was a wrong of which he deeply
repented."

It does not become me to speak of it,"
said Alvar proudly.

*' You must not exaggerate," said Mr.
Ellesmere . * ' It would be hard for Cheriton to
see any one in his father's place ; but you have
won from him, at any rate, a brother's love."

** I am his dear friend," said Alvar ; ' but
it is different with Jack."

* Don't draw these fine distinctions. Bea
worthy successor to your father ; live here
among your people, as he did, in the fear of
God, and doing your duty as an English
gentleman, and be, as you have ever been,
patient and kind to your brothers. Doubtless
it seems a hard task to you, but I earnestly
believe that by God's blessing you may be all
to them that even Cheriton might be in your
place. Nay, the very differences between you
may be,  nay have been the means of good".

** You are very kind to me, sir, and I
thank you," said Alvar courteously; but
Mr. Ellesmere felt as if his words had fallen
a little flat. He felt sorry for Alvar, but he
could not look forward to the future without
uneasiness. He saw that the wrong was
neither forgotten nor forgiven, and that
there was in the young Spaniard's nature a
background of immovable pride that promised
ill for accommodating himself to unfamiliar

duties, and a want of moral insight that
would be slow in recognizing them.

It seemed rather inconsistent when Alvar
said meekly, * Cheriton will tell me in all
things what I should do," and led the way
back to the library.

Here they found the others gathered in a
group by the fire ; Nettie sitting on a stool
at Cheriton' s feet, Jack leaning over the
back of his chair, and Bob close at hand.
How much alike they looked, with their
similar colouring and outline, and faces set
in the same sorrowful stillness and softened
by the same feelings ! Alvar paused and
looked at them for a moment, but Cheriton,
seeing him, rose and came forward.

' We have been waiting for you, Alvar,"
he said. ** I have been to see grandmamma,
but I did not stay  she could not bear it ;
but now  will you come upstairs with us ?"

He gave a look of invitation to Mr.
Ellesmere also, and he followed them silently
into the chamber of death.

There lay their father, all the irritable
marks of human frailty smoothed away, and
the grand outline and long beard giving him
a likeness to some kingly monument. The
twins held by each other, their grief almost
overpowered by shrinking awe. Jack frowned
and set his mouth hard, and wrung Cherry's
hand in his stress of feeling till he almost
crushed it, while Cheriton stood quite still
and calm by Alvar's side.

* Let us pray," said Mr. Ellesmere ; and
as they all knelt down he repeated the
Lord's Prayer, and such other words as came
to him.

When they rose up again Cheriton bent
down and kissed his father's brow, and oneby
one the younger ones followed his example.
Only Alvar stood still, till Cheriton turned
to him, and taking his hand, with a look
that Mr. Ellesmere never forgot, drew him
forward.

Alvar obeyed him, but as his lips touched
his father's face the thought suddenly struck

Cheriton that it must have been for the
first time that never, even in babyhood,
had a caress passed between the father and
son ; and then, in contrast, he thought of
himself, and the grief, hitherto unrefined,
broke forth at last. He hid his face in his
hands, and hurried out of the room into his
own, away from them all.

THE Squire OF OAKBY.

A lord of fat prize oxen and of sheep,
A raiser of huge melons and of pines,
A patron of some thirty charities,
A quarter-sessions chairman."

VOL. III.

CHAPTER Xxxii.

THE Funeral.

AYild March wind, wilt thou never cease thy sighing?"

It was on a wild March morning, when
sudden gleams of radiant sunlight contended
with heavy storm-clouds, that Mr. Lester of
Oakby was buried. There was no rain, but
the violent wind carried the sound of the
knell in fitful gusts over the mourning village,
through the well-cared-for fields and plantations
of Oakby, away to Ashrigg and Elder-thwart,
bringing all the countryside in a great
concourse to the funeral. For it was a real
mourning, a real loss. Long years ago,
Fanny Lester, with her bright smile, and
clear, upward-looking eyes, had said to her
F 2

husband, 'ewe have a piece of work in the
world given to us, Gerald ; let us try and doit."
And under her strong influence the
dutiful and honourable traditions of conduct
to which Gerald Lester was born, widened
and were drawn higher ; the various offices
he held were exercised with conscientious
effort for the benefit of his neighbours ; and
his tenantry, mind, soul and body, were the
better for his life among them. They could
trust him, and if he sometimes made mistakes
from which the wise Fanny might have saved
him, her death had consecrated for him every
simple duty that she had pointed out. Now,
while 'the old Squire" still meant his
father, while he was still in the strength of
his manhood, he was gone ; and at the head
of his grave there stood, not the son they
knew, with his father's fair face and his
mother's fair soul, but the dark, stately
stranger, who  among all those north
country gentlemen, farmers, and labourers
who crowded round, those "neighbours " all

SO well known to each other  looked so
strangely out of place.

So thought another stranger who, when
he had travelled northwards, had little
thought to find himself present at such a
scene.

The Stanforths had long since returned to
London, and Gipsy found herself once more
in the midst of as pleasant a home-circle as
ever a girl grew up in, while her attention
was claimed by numerous interests, social,
intellectual, and domestic. Her mother
shook her head over the story of Jack's
proposal ; but she said very little about the
matter, secretly hoping that Gipsy would
cease to think of it on returning to another
atmosphere. All the advances, she said to
her husband, must now come from the other
side, and she could not but regard the future
as doubtful, and was slightly incredulous of
the charms of the travelling companions
whom she had not herself seen. But Jack,
while he was at Oxford, wrote to Mr.

Stanford, about once a fortnight, rather
formal and sententious epistles, which did
not contain one word about Gipsy, but
which in their regularity and simplicity
impressed her mother favourably. One
long, pleasant letter arrived from Cheriton
during his last weeks at Seville, and of this
Gipsy enjoyed the perusal. She did not
show any symptoms of low spirits, and being
a girl of some resolution of character, held
her tongue and bided her time. Perhaps a
bright and fairly certain expectation was all
she as yet wanted or was ready for. She
was young in feeling, even for her eighteen
years, and in truth they were ' beginning at
the beginning."

Still she wished ardently that her father
should accede to a request from Sir John
Hubbard, that he should come down to
Ashrigg Hall, and paint a companion picture
of his wife to the one that he had taken of
himself long ago. Lady Hubbard was infirm
and could not come to London, or Sir John

would not have made such a demand on Mr.
Stanford's time, now, of course, even more
fully occupied than it had been ten years
before.

Mr. Stanford hesitated; he did not Hke
the notion of any possible meeting with
Mr. Lester, while Jack's views remained a
secret from him ; but Sir John had shown
him a good deal of kindness, and he felt
curious to hear something of his young
friends in their own neighbourhood. So
the first week in March found him at Ash-ring,
in the midst of a large family party,
for the eldest son and his wife were staying
there, and there were several daughters at
home.

'We had hoped to give a few of our
friends the pleasure of meeting you, Mr.
Stanford," said Sir John, after diner,
when the wine was on the table, *but our
neighbourhood has sustained a great loss
in the death of a valued friend of ours,
Mr. Lester, of Oakby."

Mr. Lester of Oakby ! You don't say
so ! Surely that is very sudden," said Mr.
Stanford, infinitely shocked. *' I saw a
great deal of his sons in the south of Spain,"
he added in explanation.

'* Indeed! They are at home now, poor
fellows. They were just too late. I had
this note from Jack  that's the second
son  no, the third  this afternoon."

*' I know Jack, too," said Mr. Stanford,
as he took the note. It was a very brief
one, merely announcing his father's death,
and adding, 

'' My brothers returned from Spain this
morning. We hope that the journey has
done Cheriton no harm."

 Ah, poor Cheriton ! " said Mr. Stanford.
I fear he must have run a great risk. It
will be a terrible blow to him. We formed
something more than a travelling acquaintance."



a

Poor Mr. Lester was here only a
fortnight ago, speaking with delight of

Cheriton's entire recovery," said Lady
Hubbard.

Yes, he was much better," said Mr.
Stanford, a Httle doubtfully, " and full
of enjoyment. But this will be indeed a
startling change."

'eyes," said Sir John; "one does not
know how to think of Alvar in his father's
shoes. It was a sadly mismanaged business
altogether."

There is a great deal to like in Alvar
Lester," said Mr. Stanford ; " but of course
the circumstances are very peculiar."

"Yes. You see while the elder brother,
Robert, was alive, no one thought much of
Gerald, and when this Spanish marriage
came out, it was a great shock. And he
was too ready to listen to all the excuses
about the boy's health. If he had come
home and been sent to school in England he
might have grown up like the rest, and
black eyes instead of blue ones would have
been all the difference."

* I have always thought his long absence
inexplicable."

' Well, Lester hated the thought of his
boyish marriage, and these other boys came,
and Cherry was his darling. His wife did
make an effort once, and Alvar was brought
to France when he was about seven years
old ; but they said he was ill, and took him
back again. Then when old Mrs. Lester
came into power she opposed his coming,
and things slipped on. I don't think he was
expected to live at first, and, poor fellow !
no one wished that he should."

The second Mrs. Lester must have
been a very remarkable person," said Mr.
Stanford.

She was," said Lady Hubbard warmly.
She was a person to raise the tone of a
whole neighbourhood. She made another
man of her husband, and he worshipped her.
She was no beauty, and very small, but with
the brightest of smiles, and eyes that seemed
to look straight up into heaven. No one

could forget Fanny Lester. She influenced
every one."

There was much more talk, and many side
lights were cast on Mr. Stanford's mind
when he heard of Alvar's broken engagement
to Virginia Seyton, and of her pretty cousin
Kuth's recent marriage to Captain Lester,
'though at one time every one thought
that there was something between her and
Cheriton." He could not but think most of
how his own daughter's future might be
affected by this sudden freeing of her young
lover from parental control ; but he was full
of sympathy for them all, and the note that
he wrote to Cheriton was answered by a
request that he would accompany Sir John
Hubbard to the funeral : ' ' They could never
forget all his kindness in another time of.
trouble."

It was a striking group of mourners. Alvar
stood in the midst, dignified and impassive,
and by his side a tall, girlish figure, with
bright hair gleaming through her crape

veil, the three other brothers together, looking
chiefly as if they were trying to preserve
an unmoved demeanour; Rupert's face behind
them, like enough to suggest kindred, and
Judge Cheriton's keen cultivated face ; Mr.
Seyton, pale, worn, and white-haired, and
his brother's tanned, weather-beaten countenance,
ruddy and solemn, above his clerical
dress. Many a fine, powerful form and
handsome outline showed among the men,
whose fathers had served Mr. Lester's ; and
behind, crowds of women, children, and old
people filled the churchyard and the lanes
beyond.

As the service proceeded the heavy clouds
parted, and a sudden gleam of sunlight fell,
lighting up the violet pall and the white
wreaths laid on it, the surplices of the
choristers, and the bent heads of the mourners.
Cheriton looked up at last away from the
open grave, through the break in the clouds,
but with a face strangely white and sad in
the momentary sunlight. Jack, as they

turned away, caught sight of Mr. Stanford,
and the sudden involuntary look of pleasure
that lightened the poor boy's miserable face
was touching to see. When all was over,
and, in common with most of those from a
distance, Mr. Stanford had accompanied
Sir John Hubbard up to the house, Jack
sought him out, hardly having a word to
say ; but evidently finding satisfaction in his
presence.

'soh, we have nothing picturesque at
home, but still I should like to show you
Oakby," Cheriton had said, as they walked
together in the beautiful streets of Seville ;
but the long table in the old oak dining-room,
covered with family plate, the sombre, faded
richness of colouring that told of years of
settled dignified life, were not altogether
commonplace, any more than the pair of
brothers who occupied the two ends of the
table. It was not till there was a general
move that Cheriton came up and put his
hand into his friend's.

'' We all like to think that yoa have been
here", he said. 'you will come again
while you are at Ashrigg ? " 

''I will, indeed. And you,  these cold
winds do not hurt you ? "

''No, I think not. My uncle wishes Sir
John Hubbard to hear some of our arrangements
; you will not mind waiting for a
little."

He spoke very quietly, but as if there were
a great weight upon him, while his attention
was claimed by some parting guest.

Well, Cheriton, good-bye ; this is a
sorrowful day for many. You must try and
teach your poor brother to fill your father's
place. We are all ready to welcome him
among us, and we hope he will take an
interest in everything here."

"You are very kind, Mr. Sutton," said
Cheriton, rather as if he thought the kindness
too outspoken.

Then a-much older face and voice took a
turn.

' Good-bye, my lad. Your grandfather
and I were friends always, and I little thought
to see this day. Keep things going, Cherry,
for the old name's sake.

I shall be in London soon," said Cherry
ungraciously, for the echoes of his own forebodings
were very hard to bear. Then
Rupert came up with a warm hand-shake,

'good-bye, my dear fellow. I hope we
shall see you in London. Don't catch
another bad cold. I hope you'll all get along
together."

I dare say we shall. But thank you, it
was very good of you to come just now."

'* Just off your wedding trip, as I understand
? " said the old gentleman.

' Yes ; we came back from Paris a few
days ago, and I must get back to town tonight,"
said Rupert, as Chert on moved away
to join his uncle for a sort of explanation of
the state of affairs to the younger ones, and
for the reading of the will, though . its chief
provisions were well known to him.

Alvar, as his father had done before him,
inherited the estate free from debt or ,
with such an income as sounded to
his Spanish notions magnificent ; but which
those better versed in English expenditure
knew would find ample employment in all
the calls of such a place as Oakby. It was
quite sufficient for the position, but no more.
The estate, of course, still remained chargeable
with old Mrs. Lester's jointure. Mr.
Lester had enjoyed the interest of his wife's
fortune during her life, the bulk of which had
come to her from an aunt, and was secured
to her daughter ; her three sons succeeding
to five thousand pounds apiece, and for this
money Judge Cheriton, and a certain General
Fleming, a relation of the Cheritons, were
joint trustees. So the will, made almost as
soon as Mr. Lester inherited the property,
had stood, and indeed most of its provisions
had been made by his father. Since his illness,
however, a codicil had been added,
stating that Mr. Lester had intended to leave

the small amount of ready money at his
disposal equally among his three younger
sons, but that now he decided to leave the
whole to Cheriton, ** whose health might
involve him in more expenses, and prevent
him from using the same exertions as his
brothers." He also joined his two elder
sons, with their uncle, Judge Cheriton, in the
personal guardianship of John, Robert, and
Annette. There were a few gifts and legacies
to servants and dependants, and that was
all.

** Nothing," remarked Judge Cheriton,
after a pause,  could be more proper than
this decision with regard to Cheriton, though
wee hope its necessity has passed away ; but
under the very peculiar circumstances everyone
has felt that it would have been well if
a somewhat larger proportion of his mother's
fortune could have come to him."

Of course," said Jack, ' it is all right."
'but my father might have trusted him
to me," said Alvar.

VOL. Ill G

* Such things should always be in black
and white," said the judge. 'your father
has shown marked confidence both in you
and in Cheriton by giving you a share in the
charge of the younger ones, and this desire
will, of course, naturally affect our arrangements
for them. Annette's home at least
must be fixed by her grandmother's."

'but my grandmother will stay here,"
said Alvar, in a tone of surprise. "Why
should she change ? It will be all the same.
And the boys too, and my sister, and Cheriton
of course  we must be together."

He spoke warmly, and crossing over to
Cheriton, took his hand as he spoke.

This is your home, my brother, always."
You are very good to us, Alvar, thank
you," said Cheriton, hardly able to speak.

' Most kind, ' ' said the judge ; ' ' whatever
may be decided on, your offer is suggested
by a most proper feeling, of which I hope
all are sensible."

Alvar is very kind," said Jack shyly.

** Would you not expect that Cheriton
should be  kind ' to you ? Then why not I,
as well ? " said Alvar.

' Such an arrangement," said the judge,
' would not be binding on Cheriton even in
your place. I am rejoiced to see so good an
understanding between you. Alvar has a
great deal of business before him, and it
would be a pity to make any changes at
present. But as for you, Cheriton, is it
wise to remain here so early in the year ?"

''No," said Alvar; ''I think we should
go to the south for a little."

"I think the calls upon your time  "
began the judge, but Cheriton interposed.

I don't think I am any the worse for the
weather," he said, 'rand I should not like
to go away now. We shall all have a great
deal to do."

Sir John Hubbard spoke a few friendly

words and offered any assistance or advice to

Alvar in his power, and then took his leave,

as did Mr. Malcolm. Alvar and Jack, with

G 2

the judge, accompanied them into the hall ;
and no sooner had the door of the study
closed than Nettie, who had been a silent
spectator of the scene, suddenly burst out, 

'I don't care! I will say it! It maybe
very kind of Alvar, but it is horrible,
horrible to think he is master and may do
what he pleases with us. I hate to stay
here if he is to give us leave."

** I told you, Nettie," said Bob, with masculine
prudence, that no one ought to said
those things."

"Nor feel them, I hope," said Cherry.
Nettie, my dear child, you must not make
it worse for us all. We feel our great loss ;
but you know the future will not be easy for
Alvar himself."

*' I know," sobbed Nettie, with increasing
vehemence, * that he will not be like  like
papa. I can't bear to think that the dear
place all belongs to him, and the things, and
the animals even, and the horses. He
doesn't love them, nor the place, and ive do!"

*Be silent, Nettie," said Cheriton, with
unusual sternness; '* I will never listen to one
word like this. There is nothing wrong
about it. Think of all that Alvar has done
for me, and then say if such words are
justifiable."

The severity of the tone silenced Nettie 
it was meant to silence poor Cheriton's
own heart. He was stern to his sister
because he felt severely towards himself; but
Nettie thought him unjust, and only moved
by partiality for Alvar. He saw complications
far beyond her childish jealousy, and
vet he shared it. And above all was the
anguish of a personal loss, a heavy grief that
filled up all the intervals of perplexing anticipations
and business cares.

The twins went away together, and Cherry
sat down in his father's chair and leaned his
head back against the cushion of it. It was
all over, all the love that had had so many
last thoughts for him, and, alas ! no last
words. They had indeed parted for ever in

this life ; but how differently from what he
had expected last year. Over ! and the
future looked difficult and dark. '' He does
not love them, and we do." It was too true.
Cherry was tired out with the long, hasty
journey, the succeeding strain of occupation,
and with the sorrow that weighed him down
a sorrow that only now seemed to come
upon him in all its strength. He was not
conscious of the passing of time till a hand
was laid on his shoulder, and Alvar's voice
said softly, " I have been looking for you,
Thereto mio,'

** Oh, I am very tired," said Cherry.

How strange it was to rouse himself from
thoughts in which Alvar's image brought
such a sense of trouble and perplexity, to
feel the accustomed comfort of his presence !
How strange to shrink so painfully from the
thought of his foreign brother's rule in his
father's place, and yet to feel the fretting
weariness soothed insensibly by the care on
which he had learned to depend. He could

not think this crooked matter straight, he
could not even feel compunction for his own
fears. He was tired and wretched, and Alvar
knew just what was restful and comforting
to him.

Chapter XXXVII.

THE NEW MASTER.

Against each one did each contend,
And all against the heir."

By the next morning Charlton's thoughts
had cleared themselves, and matters began
to take some shape ; he could make up his
mind to a certain line of conduct, or at least
could place a distinct aim before him. He
had often before been forced to acknowledge
that Alvar's character, as well as his position,
had its own rights ; they must take him as
they found him ; neither his faults nor his
excellencies were theirs  and how much
Cherry owed to those very points in Alvar
which had come on them like a surprise !
Was it not the height both of ingratitude
and of conceit to think of him as of one to
be altered and influenced before he could befit
for his new station ? Why would not

Alvar's gentleness, honour, and courtesy, his
undoubted power of setting himself aside,
make him as valuable a member of society
as industry, integrity, and regard for those
about him had made of his father ? It was
his misfortune, not his fault, that he was a
square man in a round hole ; and what could
Cherry do but try to round off a few angles
or poke a few corners for them to stick into ?
Was it prejudice and unworthy jealousy that
made him unable to accept this view, or was
there something in Nettie's vehement disapproval,
however unkindly and arrogantly it
was expressed ? If Alvar chose he could
make a very good Squire Lester. Yes, if 
There was the question. The English
Lesters sometimes did right, and sometimes
some of them very often  did wrong ; but
they one and all recognized that doing right
was the business of their lives, and that if
they did wrong they must repent and suffer.
They certainly behoved that 'conduct is
nine tenths of life," in other words, that
they must '* do their duty in that state of
life to which they were called."

But in Alvar this motive seemed almost
non-existent. He did not care about his
own duty or other people's. Only such a
sense, or the strong influence of the religion
from which in the main it sprang, or a sort
of enthusiasm equally foreign to him, could
have roused an indolent nature to the supreme
effort of altering his whole way of
living, of caring for subjects hitherto indifferent
to him  in short, of changing his
entire self. No doubt Alvar would think
something due to his position, and something
more to please Cheriton, but he would not
regard shortcomings as of any consequence ;
in short, it was not that Alvar's principles
were different from theirs, but that as motives
of action he had not got any ; not that he
had Spanish instead of English notions of
property, poetics, or religion, but that he
did not care to entertain any notions at all.

Cheriton understood enough now of the
shifting scenes of Spanish life to understand
that this might be their effect on an outsider
who saw many different schemes of life all
produce an equally bad effect on society ; but

it was none the less peculiarly ill-adapted to
an owner of English property ; and he took
leave to think that if Spanish gentlemen in
past generations had administered justice in
their own neighbourhoods, mended their own
roads, and seen to the instruction of their
own tenants, a happier state of things
might have prevailed at the present time in
the peninsula. Anyhow, to him, as to his
father, the welfare of Oakby was very dear 
dearer now than ever, for his father's sake.
One thought had troubled Mr. Lester's last
hours, that by his own conduct he had
allowed Alvar to become unfit to succeed
him : all, therefore, that Cheriton could do
to remove that unfitness was so much work
done for his father's sake ; all, too, that
made Alvar happy, was an undoing of the
wrong that he had suffered. There was no
real discord between what was right by Alvar
and by Gaby and by his own sense of right.
To make the best of Alvar, to allow for all
his difficulties, to help him in every possible
way, was not only due to that loving brother,
but was the right way to be loyal to his

father's higher self, and to clear his memory
from those weaknesses and errors which
cling to every one in this mortal life  was,
too, the only way to see his work carried
on.

This lehigh endeavour" came to Cheriton,
indeed, as 'ran inward light" to brighten
the perplexed path before him. Sorrow,
he had already learnt, could be borne,
difficulties might be overcome, now that his
inmost feelings were at peace.

Certainly he had enough on his hands.
Much of the correspondence with old friends
fell naturally to his share. English
'' business " was unintelligible to Alvar
without his explanations, and though the
new Squire showed himself perfectly willing
to receive from Mr. Malcolm an account of
the various sources of his income, and submitted
to go through his father's accounts,
and to hear reports from farmers and bailiffs,
he always insisted on Cheriton's presence at
these interviews ; and though he was too
easily satisfied with the fact that ' ' my
brother understands," no one could have

expected him to find it all quite easy to
understand himself.

Cherry apologized for putting his finger
in every pie.

''Oh," said Alvar cheerfully; ''I could
not make the pie if I put in both my hands."

But Cheriton knew perfectly well that the
parish and the estate believed themselves to
be entering on the reign of King Log. Any
breakers, however, in this direction where
still far ahead ; but within doors difficulties
and incongruities came sooner to a point,
and Alvar was by no means always to blame
for them.

On the day after the funeral, Mrs. Lester
resumed her place in the family ; but her
son's death had aged her much, and to see
Alvar in his place was gall and wormwood
to her. She accepted his offer of a home,
and thanked him for it with dignity and
propriety ; but she did not attempt to
conceal from the young ones that she
grudged him the power to make it.

The household arrangements went on as
usual, and Alvar' s behaviour to her was irreproachable

in its courtesy and consideration,
nor did she ever clash with him, but reserved
her fears and her disapprobation for Cherry's
benefit.

Nettie had come back from London at
Christmas, and nothing more had been heard
of Dick Seyton, who was then absent from
home ; but the recollection of that episode
prompted Mrs. Lester to give a ready consent
to Judge Cheriton's proposal that she should
go at Easter to school for a year. Bob, too,
who had been taken away from school at
Christmas, where his career had not lately
been satisfactory, was at present reading with
a clergyman at Hazelbyby, and was to be sent
to a tutor by-and-by. Li the meantime,
both he and Nettie were as unhappy as
young creatures can be when their world is
all changed for them ; with their hearts
yearning towards what they already called
old times. And all the force of their
natures concentrated into a sort of fierce,
aggressive loyalty to every practice, opinion,
and tradition of the past, and to this code
they viewed Cherry as a traitor. It was a

cruel offence when he happened to say that
he liked to dank chocolate, and when Alvar
made a point of his having some ; when
Alvar now and again used Spanish expressions
in speaking to him, when he pronounced
Spanish names in Spanish fashion, or, worst
of all, regretted Spanish sunshine ; when he
yielded to Alvar' s care for his health, or
seemed to turn to him for sympathy  a
hundred such pin-pricks occurred every day.
And yet the foolish twins scrupulously did
what they thought their duty. That Alvar
owned their father's horses cost Nettie floods
of tears ; but she insisted on Bob asking his
permission before he took one to ride to
Hazelbyby, and she always showed him a kind
of sulky deference.

' How can you be so silly, Nettie ? " said
Jack, in answer to a pettish remark. 'Do
you want Cherry to quarrel with Alvar ? "

* No," said Nettie;  but I didn't think he
would have /z'M Spain, and have talked so
much about the pictures and things. Last
night he asked Alvar to play to him."

I should think you might be glad to see

him pleased with anything ; he looks wretched
enough."

'' Well, I like what I'm used to," said
Nettie, in a choked voice. 'I don't care
to hear about all the stupid people you met
in Spain."

' The friends we made in Spain," said
Jack, in high indignation, '' were people with
whom it was a privilege to associate."

'I daresay," said Nettie; 'but old
acquaintances are good enough for me ; and
old weather and everything. Yes, Buffer,
ril take you out, if it is a nasty cold
morning."

And Nettie went off, with a train of dogs
behind her, angry with all her brothers, for
even Bob had had the sense to grumble out
"that people must do as they pleased, and
she had better let Cherry and Alvar alone,"
and feeling as if she only were faithful to
the dear home standard.

As Jack stood by the hall fire, heavy-hearted
enough himself, in spite of his
rebuke to his sister, there was a ring at the
bell, and the cloud cleared from his brow ashe

started forward to greet Mr. Stanford
with an eagerness unusual with him.

He was too unaffectedly pleased to be
embarrassed, and began almost at once, 

'' My uncle Cheriton comes back to us
to-night. He had to leave us on the day
after we saw you ; Cherry has promised to
speak to him, that we may come to an
understanding before I go back to Oxford."

Mr. Stanford smiled a little.

"When do you come of age. Jack?" he
said.

*'I shall be twenty next week," said Jack,
in a tone of humiliation. " If I take a fair
degree, I shall try for a mastership in one of
the public schools. I should like that, and
and it is suitable to getting married,"
concluded Jack blushing.

' Very well, ' ' said Mr. Stanford.   Then
you shall come and tell me of your intentions
for the future in a year's time from next
week. Wait a bit," as Jack looked exceedingly
blank. '' If circumstances had
not so sadly changed, no other decision
would have been possible for you. I have

VOL. III. H

no objection, in the meantime, to see you
occasionally at my house, as I think you
should both have every opportunity of testing
the permanence of such quick springing
feelings."

Mr. Stanford smiled as he spoke ; but
Jack said after a moment, 

You mean that I must earn her ? Well,
I will."

There was a solemn abruptness in Jack's
manner that provoked a smile ; but his self-confidence
was tempered by a look of such
absolute honesty and sincerity in his bright
blue eyes, he looked such a fine young fellow
in all the freshness and strength of his youth,
that it would have been difficult to doubt
either his purposes or his power of carrying
them out.

'don't you think you might have asked
Mr. Stanford to take off his coat and come
into the library before entering on such an
important subject ? " said Cheriton, joining
them.

*' I beg your pardon," said Jack. *' Please
come in ; I was not thinking  "

'* Of anything but your own affairs ? No,
that's very unfair, for I am sure you have
taken heed to every one else's," said Cherry,
as he led the way into the library, where on
the table was a great accumulation of papers,
looking like the materials for a heavy morning's
work.

Cherry sent Jack to find Alvar, and told
him to order some wine to be brought into
the library, apologizing to Mr. Stanford for
not asking him to lunch, as their grandmother
was unequal to seeing a stranger ;
and then, in Jack's absence, he listened to
Mr. Stanford 's ultimatum, and owned that
it was a great relief not to have to startle
his relations just now with what would seem
an incongruous proposal ; but praising Jack's
sense and consideration in their trouble, and
speaking of him with a kind of tender pride,
unlike the tone of one so nearly on the same
level of age, and whose life also was but
beginning. He said that he should come
to London at Easter, but that in the meanwhile
there was much to be done at home.
English affairs were naturally puzzling to
H 2

Alvar, and a great deal of the business
concerned them all.

'* You must remember that you ought to
be still taking holiday," said Mr. Stanford.

Oh, yes. At least Alvar and Jack never
let me forget it. But, indeed, I am quite
well, and though I feel the cold, I don't think
it means to hurt me. It is better to have
plenty to do."

Cherry's manner was not uncheerful, and
though he looked pale and delicate, there
was no longer the appearance of broken
health and spirits which had marked him
at their first acquaintance ; but the quick,
changeable brightness was gone also. He
vas like one carrying a load which took all
his strength ; but he carried it without
staggering.

Alvar now came in with Jack, looking
bright and cordial.

** My brother is teaching me how to bethe
Squire," he said to Mr. Stanford, with
a smile, as he put aside the papers to make
room for the tray that had been ordered;
*' but I am not a good scholar."

*' You must go regularly to school, then,"
said Mr. Stanford.

*Ah," said Alvar; ' I must know, it
seems, about rents, and tenants, and freeholds
 so many things. But there is
something that we wish to ask of Mr.
Stanford, is there not. Cherry ? "

** Yes  we spoke of it."

 It is that he will try to make a drawing
of our father for us, for there is none that
my brothers like."

*' I will try with pleasure, but I am afraid
likenesses, under the circumstances, are
rarely quite satisfactory. You have h
photograph ? "

Jack produced a very bad daguerreotype,
and a photograph taken for Cheriton before
he left home.

*' This is a good likeness," he said ; '' but
Cherry thinks it wants fire and spirit."

'' I will take both," said Mr. Stanford,
seeing that Cherry had turned aside from
the photograph, and took no part in the
discussion. " I will make a little sketch, and
when you are in London you can tell me

what you wish about it. And now I think I
must be getting back to Ashrigg ; tomorrow
I go home."

Jack eagerly said that tomorrow he was
going to London on his way to Oxford, and
received the longed-for permission to call at
Kensington. Poor boy ! he could not keep
himself from looking ecstatically happy even
while he told Mr. Stanford, as he walked
through the park with him, how sorry he
was to leave Cheriton with so much on his
hands.

Cheriton himself would gladly have kept
Jack beside him. He was capable of seeing
both sides of the difficult question, and was,
moreover, so individual and independent in
his modes of thought, that home matters
were less personal to him. He had, too, his
own hopes, and had chalked out his own
career, so that, young as he was, he was a
support to Cherry's spirits, even while more
than half the reason why his own were less
overpowered was that the brother who was
all in all to him was still left. His presence
did not always conduce to peace with Bob,

for he had grown away from him, and was
disposed to lecture him; but though he
departed with more good advice to his family
than was necessary, he left another gap, and
Cherry, trying to rouse himself from the
added feeling of loneliness, went over to
Elderthwaite to see the old parson. He had
been away so long that every familiar place
brought fresh associations, and he tried to
get the first sight of each one over quickly
and alone.

He could not walk past the stables and
through the farm-buildings without the
image of his father meeting him at every
turn. Here they had planned a new fence
together, in this direction the very last walk
he had had strength for before leaving home
had been taken. How well he remembered
then sitting on that bench under the stable
wall, and watching his father with a sad
wonder if he should ever sit there again.
This was the short way from the station by
which he used to come home from school.
Here his father used to meet him  nay,
suddenly he recollected, with a memory that

started into life after lying asleep for years,
here he had parted for the last time from his
mother, and the long-past grief seemed to
come back in the light of the new one. He
said to himself that he ought to rejoice in
the thought that his parents were once more
together; but in the strangest way he longed
for this long-lost mother to comfort him in
the new grief of his father's death.

And then he walked on through the fir
plantation, across the bit of bare, bleak fell,
into the woods of Elderthwaite. And as he
walked he thought of Jack's bright hopes,
and of that sweet and promising future that
was to make up to him for all that the past
had taken from him. Here, by the broken
stile and ruinous wall, all hope of such a
future had been dashed away from Cheriton's
heart. This memory had no sweetness to
temper its pain ; and he hurried on through
the plantation and down the lane that led to
the vicarage. As he passed the church he
saw that some one was trimming the ivy
round the windows, and it struck him that
they had been cleaned, and that the whole

place had a somewhat improved appearance.
A little girl made him a curtsey ; she wore
a smart red flannel hood, and had a clean
face ; he thought that he had never seen an
Elderthwaite child look so respectable. Nay,
as he passed one of the larger cottages, it
shone upon him resplendent with whitewash,
and looking in at the open door he beheld
a row of desks, and sundry boys and girls
seated thereat, and with curiosity much
excited by this evidence of reform, he hastened
on towards the vicarage.

CHAPTER Xxxviii.

PLANS AND Experiments.

I am sick of the hall and the hill, I am sick of the
moor and the main."

Virginia Seyton had spent her Christmas
at Littleton, and after returning to London
for her cousin Ruth's marriage, had come
home again at the end of January. At
Littleton, more than one old friend had advised
her to reconsider her resolve to live at
Elderthwaite ; but Virginia did not feel
herself tempted by any proposal of cottage,
however charming, or companionship, however
congenial. She had been lonely, unhappy,
and forlorn at Elderthwaite ; but
somehow it pulled at her heart-strings. She
could not rejoice over all the well-ordered
services at Littleton, much as they refreshed

her spirits, as she did over the new hymn
which she and Mrs. Clements drilled into the
Elderthwaite children; and she found herself
believing, when receiving the correct
answers of her former scholars, that there
was after all '' something " in the north-country
intellect, however untrained, that
was superior in quality, if not in quantity,
to that of the south. When she went back
to London, common acquaintances brought
her into contact with the Stanforths. She
and Ruth went to an evening party at their
house, just as Mr. Stanford and Gipsy returned
from Spain, and were invited to come
afterwards and see the Spanish sketches.
Ruth was glad to make all the business that
pressed on her an excuse for refusing ; but
Virginia went, and was happier than she
had been for months in hearing Alvar spoken
of, and spoken of in terms of praise. Neither
girl was conscious of the other's interest in
this meeting  how Gipsy listened to *' someone
who had known Jack all his life," how
Virginia watched Alvar's recent companion ;
but Gipsy's blushes came in the right place,

and in spite of lier extreme amaze at the
idea of Jack in this new capacity, Virginia
guessed where the spark had been Halted,
and so could Hsten fearlessly to the story of
the adventures at Eonda, and could look
with pleasure at the sketches of which Alvar's
figure was a picturesque element. It was a
pleasant peep at a new life linked with her
old one.

Ruth's was a very brilliant wedding. Everything
was arranged by her grandmother, and
bridesmaids, dresses, breakfast, and even
church, were all chosen with exact regard to
the correct fashion of the moment. Ruth
wished it all to be over that she might find
herself away with Rupert ; then perhaps she
would feel at rest. As it was, their rapid,
interrupted surface intercourse tantalized
her almost as much as their occasional interviews
in the days of secrecy and silence.
And when they were alone, Ruth was afraid
to go deep. Often had she said, *' In my
love there shall be perfect confidence ; there
shall be nothing between my soul and his."
And now her past transgression, however

excusable it might seem, erred against this
perfect confidence. And Eupert's '* soul "
was not at all ready to display itself to her,
or to himself either, partly because he was
not serious in his emotions, any more than
in his principles, but partly also because he
not unnaturally considered that when this
deeds were satisfactory to Kuth, it was quite
unnecessary to analyze his feelings. So she
had no encouragement to confidence, and the
perfect union for which she had longed, disappointed
her, partly through her past falsity,
but more from the want of any common aim
or principle to unite them. Ruth was fairly
happy; but she was the same Ruth still,
with a nature that could never be satisfied
without earnestness equalling her own, an
earnestness from the purity and simplicity of
which she had turned aside to seek a sort of
consecration of life luhich only a man of high
principle and strong purpose could recdly have
helped her to find, in a love which she thought
more powerful because it was more regardless
of duty, in which view she did but follow
much teaching and many writers.

Kuth did not make the confession which
would have set her right with herself if not
with Rupert, she had practised too much
self pleasing to find the courage for it. She
married ; and as life went on her aspirations
would either die into the commonplace she
had despised, or she might be driven to
satisfy them elsewhere than with Rupert.

And Virginia, who equally with Ruth
idealized life and its relations, and who also
found her ideal unfulfilled  unfulfilled, but
not destroyed. She had lost her lover, but
the good and holy life which she had thought
to lead with him, though its beauty took a
sterner cast, was possible without him. Life
was not purposeless, though it was very
difficult, and poor Virginia was diffident of
her own powers, and was, moreover, in many
ways ill-fitted to live with those whose views
of life were uncongenial to her.

** If I had more tact I should get on better
at home ; if I had had more patience, more
charity, I should not have quarrelled with
Alvar," she thought, and with some truth.
But when she came back to Elderthwaite it

was coming home. Dick and Harry were glad
to see her ; her father said it looked cheerful
to have her about again ; the little housemaid,
whom she had taught for an hour
on Sundays, was enchanted, and had written
copies and learnt hymns in her absence;
while she could not but be welcome to her
aunt, whom she found suffering from a severe
attack of rheumatism, which confined her to
her room. Virginia had no natural skill in
nursing, and Miss Seyton was not fond of
attentions. But, though she was severely
uncomplaining, Virginia's companionship was
enlivening, and, moreover, while she was
incapacitated, her niece was obliged to
manage the house. She had bought enough
bitter experience now not to be frightened
and startled at the state of things, and she
perceived how much Miss Seyton had done
to keep things straight. But the young,
fresh influence brightened up the old dependents,
and she managed, too, to introduce
some little comfort. But a piece of home
work really within her powers came to her
in an unexpected quarter. Dick's examination

was to take place in about six weeks,
and she found from Harry that he had been
really reading for it, and to her great surprise
and pleasure he did not resent her
interest in it. Her French, and history, and
arithmetic were quite enough in advance of
Dick's to make her aid valuable to him, and
finding how much he was behindhand, spite
of some honest though fitful efforts, she gave
him some lessons with the tutor at Hazelbyby
to whom Bob Lester was sent, and as Dick
always brought his papers to her afterwards,
there was no question that he actually availed
himself of the opportunity.

As for the old parson, he greeted her with
a perfect effusion of delight. He had come
to love her better than anything in the world
except Cheriton, whose illness had been a
real sorrow to him. The little improvements
had not been allowed to languish  indeed
others had been projected. Mr. Clements
had not been idle. A poor widow, whose
continued respectability had certainly been
partly owing to her attachment to Mr.
Seyton's rival or assistant, 'the oldMethody,"

had a niece who had been trained as a pupil-teacher
in a parish belonging to a friend of
Mr. Ellesmere's, and, her health failing, the
girl had come to live with her aunt. Hence
a proposal for a little day-school ; and
actually a subscription set on foot by Mr.
Clements

So sou see, Miss Seyton," he had said,
*' we have not been quite idle in your absence."


** Indeed," said Virginia, smiling, " you
seem to have done better without me."

*' No, Miss Seyton, whatever better things
we may succeed in doing in Elderthwaite in
the future, it is your doing that the wash to
improve had been awakened."

Virginia blushed at this magnificent compliment
; but it was true. High principle,
recommended by gentleness and humility,
must in the end win its way.

These various changes formed a safe subject
of conversation in a meeting that could
not fail on many accounts to be trying, when

This of course took place before the passing of the
Education Act.

VOL. III. I

Cheriton, as he came up to the vicarage, met
Virginia going in there also. He did not
want to talk about his own health or home
difficulties, she could not fail to be conscious ;
but the parson was only restrained, or not
restrained, by her presence from lamentations
over Alvar's succession, and looked
unspeakably wicked when Cherry implied
that they were getting on smoothly. So the
new school came in handy, and Parson Seyton
talked about a ' Government grant," and
winked at Cherry over his shoulder.

*sit's all getting beyond me. Cherry," he
said ;  I'm not the man for these new lights."

* You'll have to get a curate, parson,"
said Cherry.

** Nay nay!" said the parson sharply.
** I'll have no strangers prying into all our
holes and corners, and raking out the dust.
I don't like curates  hate their long coats
and long faces."

* You might put in the advertisement
round and rosy preferred,' " said Cherry.

*nay, nay, my lad; no curates for me,
unless you will apply for the situation."

"Cherry has a very long coat on," said
Virginia, smiling and pointing to his
"ulster."

"And not too round a face nowadays,
eh ? Never mind, if he came here I'd let
him wear  "

"A cassock, perhaps," said Cheriton.
I feel all the force of the compliment. But
I think Queenie is the best curate for Elder-thwart
at present."

Virginia's heart danced at the familiar
brotherly name by which Cheriton had
learned from Ruth to call her in the days of
her engagement, but which had never become
her home appellation, and something in her
face made him whisper under his breath as
she rose to take leave, 

Though Oakby grudges her to you."

Virginia hurried away, but she was presently
overtaken by Cheriton as she paused
at a cottage door, and they walked up the
lane together, and talked of the Stanforths ;
and when Virginia praised Gipsy, neither
could help a smile of implied comprehension
and sympathy.

I 2

It was a bright, pleasant day, the puddles
and ditches of the Elderthwaite hedgerows
sparkled in the spring sunshine, the blackthorn
put out its shy blossoms on each side.
Virginia smiled and looked up gaily, and
Cheriton's voice took its natural lively tone
as he related some of the humours of their
Spanish journey*!

must turn off here," said Cherry, as
they came to a stile. But Virginia did not
answer him, for, leaning against the fence,
stood Alvar, watching them as they approached.
A patrick and tumble-down cart-shed,
and a waggon with its poles turned up
in the air, formed a strangely incongruous
background for his graceful figure, his deep
mourning giving him an additional air of
picturesque dignity.

There was no escape for Virginia. She
turned exceedingly pale, but with a self-command
that, in Cheriton's opinion, did
her infinite credit, she bowed  she had not
courage to put out her hand  and said
timidly, 

' Good morning."

Alvar's olive face coloured all over ;
he bowed, for once utterly and evidently
at a loss, while Cherry plunged into the
breach.

' Hallo, Alvar, have you come to look forme
? I have been to see Parson Seyton. You
have no idea what grand doings there are
now in Elderthwaite."

*I did not come to look for you," said
Alvar, with some emphasis.

*' Well, I was coming home."

Then Alvar turned, and with a sort of
haughty politeness hoped that Mr. and Miss
Seyton were well ; and Virginia, in the sweet
tones unheard for so many months, replied
to him, and after shaking hands withCheriton,
walked away down the sunny lane, from
which she could not turn aside, and which
afforded no shelter from any eyes that might
choose to follow her.

Alvar, however, turned away, and Cherry
following, said, 

'' I think a little light will dawn on Elder-thwart
one day, thanks to Virginia."

Alvar did not make any answer, and

Cheriton was not at all sorry to see how
much the meeting had disturbed him.

He never alluded to it again, but whether
from any feelings connected with it or from
the worries of his new position, he was less
even-tempered than usual.

There was much to try him. So many
matters pressed on him, and he was so very
much at fault as to the way of dealing with
them. Mr. Lester had kept a considerable
portion of his property in his own hands ; he
had also been a most active magistrate, sat
upon innumerable county committees, and had
united in his own person the chief lay offices
of the parish. In all these capacities he had
done a considerable amount of useful work,
and though no one expected Alvar to take
up the whole of it, he ought to have endeavoured
to make himself master of the
more necessary parts.

But the real defect of Alvar's nature the
intense pride, that made the sense of being
at a disadvantage hateful to him  worked at
first in a wrong direction. The great effort
of bending himself to learn to do badly what

those around him could do well, was beyond
one who had never felt the need of repentance,
never acknowledged an error m himself; nor
did the sense of duty to his neighbour, that
counteracted this tendency in others of his
name, appeal to the conscience of one who
inherited the selfish instincts of the Spanish
grandee. After the very first he grew impatient
of the tasks that were so new to him,
and yet resentful of any comment on his
behaviour. He resented the standard to
which he would not conform, all the more
because an unspeakable soreness connected
it with Virginia's rejection of him.

Perhaps this was more hopeful than his
former good-humoured indifference, but it
was with exceeding pain that Cheriton, before
Easter came, began to perceive that though
Alvar would let him please himself in any
special instance, his hopes of exerting any
general influence were vain, and that Alvar
would resent the attempt even from him.

 Did you expect to make the leopard
change his spots by the force of your will,
Cherry ? " said Mr. Ellesmere to him, when

some instance had brought this prominently
forward. "Yon cannot do it, my boy, and
excuse me for saying that I think you should
not try."

'' I only wanted to help the leopard ta
accommodate his coat to our climate," said
Cherry, with rather a difficult smile.

' He must do that himself when stress of
weather shows him the need. If he had
married, such an influence as your mother's
might have come into his life ; but, my dear
boy, even that could not have sufficed, unless
it had appealed to something higher."

* I know," said Cherry slowly. ''I know
what you mean about it. No man ought to
stand dictation as to his duty, and we all lay
down the law to each other. But I cannot
break myself of feeling that matters here are
my own concern."

' I think that is a habit of mind common
to a great many people hereabouts," said
Mr. Ellesmere kindly; 'rand, after all, what
I said was only meant as a warning."

'much needed! But I believe Alvar
will find things out in time ; and we none

of US make half enough allowance for
hin."

Jack came home for a few days at Easter,
and there was a final discussion and arrangement
of plans, which resulted after all in a
general flitting. Alvar declared that Oakby
was too dull without his brother, and that he
should himself go to London for some time.
No one could exactly find fault with this
scheme, and if he had exerted himself hitherto
to get his new duties in train, they would
have welcomed it, as his resolute avoidance
of the Seytons produced social difficulties,
and Jack thought Cheriton's London life so
much of an experiment as to be glad that he
should not have to carry it out entirely alone.
But they both knew that without any difference
that would strike outsiders, there was just
the essential change from good to bad
management, from care to neglect, in every
matter with which the master of Oakby was
concerned.

Nettie was to go to a London boarding-school
for a year. This was the express
desire of Mrs. Lester, who thought this

amount of *' finishing " essential. Lady
Clieriton was choosing the school, and
the brothers of course consented, though
Cheriton felt that it was like caging a
wild bird, and Alvar remarked with much
truth, 

** My sister is a woman; it is foolish to
send her to school."

Nettie wept torrents of tears over Colla,
Buffer, her pony, nay, every living creature
about the place ; but she did not resist, it
was part of the plan of life to which she was
accustomed.

If Mrs. Lester herself had not insisted on
sending Nettie away, the others would have
made no proposal which involved a separation
; but to the surprise of them all, she
proposed spending the ensuing three months
at Whitby. Lady Milford would be there,
and it had always been an occasional resort
of Mrs. Lester's, and with her old favourite
maid, she declared that she should be
perfectly comfortable there ; and if she was
dull, she would ask Virginia Seyton to stay
with her.

One other member of the family remained
to be disposed of, and while Cheriton and
Jack were consulting with each other what
they could say to their uncle with regard to
Bob, he took the matter into his own hands,
and as he walked across the park with
Cheriton to view some drainage operations
which had been begun by their father, and
which Alvar was very glad to let them superintend,
he remarked suddenly, 

Cherry, I wish you would let me go to
Canada, or New Zealand, or some such
place, and take land. It is the only thing
I'm fit for."

Cheriton was taken by surprise, though
the idea had crossed his own mind.

*' Do you really wish it ? " he said.

"Yes," said Bob. "I'm not going to
try my hand in life at things ether fellows
can beat me at."

I'm afraid that rule would limit the
efforts of most of us ! "

"' Well," said Bob, " I hate feeling like a
fool ; and besides, I don't see the good of
Latin and Greek. But I mean to do something

that's some use in the world. I
approve of colonizing."

'really, Bob," said Cherry, ''I don't
think you were ever expected to go in for
more Latin and Greek than would prevent
you from feeling like a fool. There's
a great deal in what you say ; hut have
you thought of a farm in England or
Scotland ? "

** Yes ; but I think that is generally a fine
name for doing nothing. Now, I shall have
some capital, and I'm big and strong, and
can make my way. Cherry, don't you think
I should have been allowed to go ? "

*eyes, Bob, I think you would; but you
are too young to start off at once on your own
resources."

Well, I could go to the agricultural
college for a year, and there are men out
there who take fellows and give them a start.
You can talk it over with Uncle Cheriton,
and if you agree, I don't care for the others."

' Does Nettie know about it ? "

"Yes," said Bob ;  she wouldn't speak
to me for a week, she was so sorry. But

she came round, and says she shall come out
and join me. Of course she won't  she'll
get married."

They had reached a little bridge which
crossed a stream, on either side of which lay
the swampy piece of ground which they had
come to inspect. Looking forward, was the
wide panorama of heathery hills, known to
them with lifelong knowledge ; looking back,
the wide, white house, in its group of fir-trees,
with the park stretching away towards the
lake. All the woods were tinted with light
spring green, and the air was full of the
song of numberless birds, and with that
cawing of the rooks, which Cheriton had
once said at Seville was to him like the
sound of the waves to a person born by the
sea.

**0f course," said Bob, *' if one went a
hundred thousand miles, one would never
forget this old place."

"No," said Cheriton; "nor, I sometimes
fancy, if one went a longer journey
still ! "

But I hate it as it is now, and I shall

come back when you're Lord Chancellor, and
Jack, Head Master of Eton."

* Well, Bob," said Cherry, wherever we
may any of us go, or whatever we may be,
I think we cannot be really parted, while we
remember the old place, and all that belongs
to it."

CHAPTEE XXXIX.

THE DRAGON SLAYER.

Life has more things to dwell on
Than just one useless pain."

There are few places where the charm of a
bright June day is felt more perfectly than ina
London garden. The force of contrast
may partly account for this ; but The
Laurels, as the Stanforths' house was called,
was a lovely place in itself, dating from days
before the villas by which it was now almost
surrounded. Within its old brown sloping
walls flourished white and pink acacias,
magnolias, westerias, and quaint trees only
found in such old gardens ; a cork-tree,
more curious than beautiful ; a catalpa,
which once in Gipsy's memory had put out
its queer brown and white blossoms ; and a

Judas-tree, still purple with its lovely flowers.
The house, like the garden walls, was built
of brown old brick, well draped with creepers ;
and Mr. Stanford's new studio had been so
cunningly devised that it harmonized wonderfully
with the rest. That garden was a very
pleasant place in the estimation of a great
many people, who liked to come and idle
away an hour there, and was famous for
pleasant parties all through the summer ;
while it was a delightful play-place for the
little Stanforths, a large party of picturesque
and lively-minded children, who, in spite of
artistic frocks and hats, and tongues trained
to readiness by plenty of home society, were
very thoroughly educated and carefully
brought up. They were a great amusement
to Cheriton Lester, who was always a
welcome guest at The Laurels, and felt
himself thoroughly at home there.

Cheriton' s London life was in many ways
a pleasant one. He found himself in the
midst of old friends and schoolfellows, he
could have as much society as he wished for,
he was free of his uncle's house and of the

'Stanforths', and he had none of the money
anxieties which troubled many of those who,
like him, were beginning their course of
preparation for a legal life. He saw a good
deal, in and out, of Alvar, who had established
himself in town, and was an exceedingly
popular person in society ; and as the
obligations of his mourning, which he was
careful to observe, diminished, was full of
engagements of all sorts, enjoyed himself
greatly, and thought as little of Oakby as
business letters allowed. Lady Cheriton
thought that he ought to have every opportunity
of settling, '' so much the best thing
for all of them," and arranged her introductions
to him accordingly ; but Alvar walked
through snares and pitfalls, and did not even
get himself talked of in connexion with any
young lady. Cheriton was much less often
to be met with ; he found that he could not
combine late hours and anything like study,
and so kept his strength for his more
immediate object  an object which, however,
was slowly changing into an occupation.
Cheriton soon found out that the pleasures

VOL. HI. K

and pains of hard and successful labour were
no longer for him ; that though he did not
break down in the warm summer weather,
the winter would always be a time of difficulty,
and that his strength would not endure a long
or severe strain  in short, that though
reading for the bar was just as well now as
anything else for him, and might lead the
way to interests and occupations, he could
not even aim at the career of a successful
lawyer. Besides, London air made him
unusually languid and listless.

' Yes, he is a clever fellow, but he is not
strong enough to do much. It is a great
pity, but, after all, he has enough to live on,
and plenty of interests in life," said Judge
Cheriton ; and his wife made her house
pleasant to Cherry, and encouraged him to
come there at all hours, and no one ever
said a word to him about working, or gave
him good advice, except not to catch cold ;
while he himself ceased to talk at all about
his prospects, but went on from day to day
and took the pleasant things that came to
him. And sometimes he felt as if his last

hope in life was gone  and sometimes, again,
wondered why he did not care more for such a
disappointment. But now and then, in these
days that were so silent and self-controlled,
there came to him an indifference of a
nobler kind, an inward courage, a consoling
trust, the reward of much struggling, which
a year ago he could never have brought to
bear on such a trial.

Mr. Stanford's presence always gave him
a sense of sympathy, and he spent so many
hours at The Laurels, that his aunt suspected
him of designs on Gipsy, though Jack's
secret, preserved in his absence, was likely
to ooze out now that the end of the Oxford
term had brought him to London for a few
days, previous to joining a reading party
with some of his friends.

The Laurels, with its pretty garden, might
be a pleasant resting-place for Cheriton, but
it was a very Arcadia, a fairy-land to Jack,
when he found his way there late on one
splendid afternoon, so shy that he had walked
up and down the road twice before he rang
the bell, happy, uncomfortable, and conscious
K 2

all at once, looking at Gipsy, who had just
come home from a garden party, in a most
becoming costume of cream colour and
crimson, but quite unable to say a word to
her, as she sat under the trees, and fanned
herself with a great black fan, appealing to
Alvar, who was there with Cheriton, whether
she had quite forgotten her Spanish skill.
Gipsy was very happy, and not a bit shy as
she peeped at her solemn young lover over
the top of the fan, and laughed behind it at
Jack's look of disgust when Cherry remarked
that he had grown since Easter.

Don't be spiteful. Cherry," said Mr.
Stanford, with a smile. *' Shall we come
and see the picture ?"

Jack and Gipsy were left to the last as
they came up towards the house, and she
made a little mischievous gesture of measuring
herself against him.

'eyes, I think it's true! "

Well," said Jack gruffly, though his
eyes sparkled, '' I shall leave off growing
some time, I suppose. I say, are you going
to dine at my aunt's tomorrow

'* Yes," said Gipsy. *lady Cheriton
has been here, and she brought your sister.
How handsome she is ; but she was so silent.
I. was afraid of her. I wonder if she liked
me'* said Gipsy, blushing in her turn.

** Shy with Nettie ? " exclaimed Jack.
** You might as well be shy of a wild cat.
She doesn't like any one much but Bob and
her pets."

' Ah, young ladies grow as well as young
gentlemen," said Gipsy. " Next year  "

*eyes; next year  " said Jack; but
Gipsy opened the studio door, and ended the
conversation.

Mr. Stanford's studio was arranged .with
a view more to the painting of pictures than
to the display of curtains, carpets, and china;
but it was still a pretty and pleasant place,
with a few rare works of art by other hands
than those of its owner. There were few
finished pictures of Mr. Stanford's there
then ; but one large canvas on which he was
working, and, besides various portraits indifferent
stages, the drawing of Mr. Lester,
which Jack had not hitherto seen. Mr.

Stanford brought it forward, and asked him
to make any comment that occurred to him.
It was a fine drawing of a fine face, and
brought out forcibly the union of size and
strength with beauty which none of the sons
fully equalled, though there might be more
to interest in all their faces. For, after all,
the little imperfections of expression, that
which was wanting as well as that which
was present in the coming out and going in,
the pleasures, the duties, and the failures,
the changes of mood and temper, the smiles
and the frowns of daily life, had made the
individual man, and could not be shown in a
likeness so taken. It was a picture that
would satisfy them better as the years went
by. Indeed Alvar thought it perfect, and
Jack could hardly say that he saw anything
wanting; but Cherry, after many praises
and some hesitation, had said, *eyes, it is
very like, but it is as if one saw him from a
distance. Perhaps that is best."

After this picture had been put away, Jack
began to look round and to relieve the impression
made on him by a little artistic

conversation, evidently carefully studied from
the latest Oxford authorities. He looked at
the pictures on the wall, found fault so
correctly with what would have naturally
been pleasing to him, and admired so much
what a few months before he would have
thought hideous, that Cheriton's eyes sparkled
with fun, and Alvar, for once appreciating
the humour of the situation, said, 

** We must ask Jack to write a book about
the pictures at Oakby ;" while Gipsy, seeing
it all, laughed, spite of herself.

** Ah, Gipsy, he is carrying his lady's
colours, like a true knight," said Cherry
softly, as Jack faced round and inquired, 

What are you laughing at ? "

*' Who lectures on art at Oxford, Jack ? "
said Cherry. ' What a first-rate fellow he
must be ! "

*' Ah, he is indeed a great teacher," said
Alvar, ** who has taught Jack to love
art."

**A mighty teacher's said Cherry, under
his breath.

*' Of course," said Jack, ' as one sees

more of the world, one comes to take an
interest in new fields of thought."

it Why, yes," said Gipsy, recovering from
Cherry's words, and flying to the rescue,
*-we all learned a great deal about art at
Seville."

*'My dear," said Mrs. Stanford, '' aren't
you going to show them the knights ? "

For she thought to herself that if a year
was to pass before Jack's intentions could
meet with an acknowledgment, his visits
had better be few and far between, especially
in the presence of Cherry's mischievous encouragement.
** Mr. Stanford himself being
as bad," as she afterwards remarked to him.

Now, however, Mr. Stanford turned his
easel round and displayed the still unfinished
picture for which he had begun to make
sketches in Spain, when struck with the
contrast of his new acquaintances, and with
the capabilities of their appearance for picturesque
treatment.

The picture was to be called ' One of the
Dragon Slayers," and represented a woodland
glade in the first glory of the earliest summer

blue sky, fresh green, white blossoms, and
springing bluebells and primroses, all in full
and yet delicate sunshine  a scene which
might have stood for many a poetic description
from Chaucer to Tennyson, a very image
of nature, the same now as in the days of
Arthur.

Dimly visible, as if he had crawled away
among the brambles and bracken to die, was
the gigantic form of the slain dragon, while,
newly arrived on the scene, having dismounted
from his horse, which was held by a page in
the distance, was a knight in festal attire 
a vigorous, graceful presentment of Alvar's
dark face and tall figure  who with one hand
drew towards him the delivered maiden, a
fair, slender figure in the first dawn of youth,
who clung to him joyfully, while he laid the
other in eager gratitude on the shoulder of
the dragon slayer, who, manifestly wounded
in the encounter, was leaning against a tree-trunk,
and who, as he seemed to give the
maiden back to her lover, with the other
hand concealed in his breast a knot of the
ribbon on her dress ; thus hinting at the

story, which after all was letter told by the
peculiar beaming smile of congratulation, the
look of victory amid strife, of conquest over
self and suffering  a look of love conquering
pain, which was the real point of the picture.

Jack stood looking in silence, and uttering
none of his newly acquired opinions.

'' Is it right. Jack ? " said Mr. Stanford.

*eyes, I know," said Jack briefly; and
then, '' Every one will know Alvar's portrait.
And who is the lady ? "

She is a little niece of mine  almost a
child," said Mr. Stanford; while Cheriton
interposed, 

** It is not a group of photographs. Jack.
Of course the object was the idea of the
picture, not our faces."

swell, Cherry," said Mr. Stanford
smiling, *your notion of sitting for your
picture partakes of the photographic. You
did not help me by calling up the dragon
slayer's look."

** That was for the artist to supply," said
Cherry; *but it seems to me exactly how
the knight ought to have looked."

*' For my part," said Alvar, I should
not have liked to have been too late."

** It is very beautiful," said Jack ; *' but I
don't think I approve of false mediaevalism.
At that date these fellows would have fought,
and the best man would have had the girl."

*spray, at what date do you fix the
dragon ? " said Cherry.

** Jack is as matter-of-fact as the maiden
herself," said Mrs. Stanford, * who will not
be happy because her uncle will not tell
her if the knight got well and married
somebody else."

*'No  no, mamma," said one of the
Stanford girls, ' he did no such thing ; he
was killed in King Arthur's last battle. We
settled it yesterday  we thought it was
nicer."

* You don't think he gave in to the next
dragon ? " said Cherry, half to tease her.

No, indeed, that knight never gave in.
Did he, papa  did he ?"

'My dear Minnie, I am not prepared
with my knights' history. There they are,
and I leave them to an intelligent public,

wbo can settle whether my object was to
paint sunlight on primroses, or a smile on a
wounded knight's face  very hard matters
both."

 Don't you really like it?" said Gipsy
aside to Jack.

*soh, yes," said Jack uneasily, **I have
seen him look so. I know what your father
means. But I hate it. I'd rather have had
a picture of him as he used to be, all
sunburnt and jolly. Yes, I know, it's the
picture, not Cherry; but I don't like it."

Gipsy demurred a little, and they fell into
a long talk in the twilight garden. Jack
kept his promise, he did not *' make love "
to her, but never, even to Cheriton, had he
talked as he talked then, for if he might not
talk of the future, he could at least make
Gipsy a sharer in all his past. When
Cheriton came out upon them to call Jack
away, they looked at him with half-dazzled
eyes, as if he were calling them back from
fairy-land.

The dinner-party at Lady Cheriton' s
offered no such chances, though it was a

gathering together quite unexpected by some
of the party. Lady Cheriton, when the
question of a school for Nettie had been
discussed, had renewed her offer of having
her to share the studies of her younger
daughters ; and Cheriton, who thought that
Nettie in a London boarding-school would be
very troublesome to others and very unhappy
herself, had succeeded in getting the plan
adopted. So here she was, dignified and
polished, in her long black dress, and bent,
so said her aunt, in asilent and grudging
fashion, on acquiring sufficient knowledge to
hold her own among other girls. She was
wonderfully handsome, and so tall that her
height and presence marked her out as much
as her intensely red-and-white complexion
and yellow hair. There, too, were Virginia
and her brother Dick, Cherry being guilty of
assuring his aunt that theresa no reason
why Alvar should not meet them. For
Dick's examination had at length been
successfully passed, and an arrangement had
been made that he should board with some
friends of Mr. Stanford's, and Virginia had

availed herself of an invitation from Lady
Cheriton to come to London with him.

* You did not tell me she was coming,"
said Alvar angrily to Cheriton.

*' It is impossible that you should avoid so
near a neighbour," replied Cherry.

' I do not like it," said Alvar; and the
effect on him was to shake his graceful
self-possession, make him uncertain of what
he was saying, and watch Virginia as she
talked to Cherry of Dick's prospects, with a
look that was no more indifferent than the
elaborate politeness of Jack's greeting
to Miss Stanford. She was more self-controlled,
but she missed no v/ord or look.
But if Cheriton had played a trick on his
brother, he himself received a startling
surprise when Mr. and Mrs. Eupert Lester
were announced .  ' You cannot avoid meeting
your cousins " was as true as his excuse to
Alvar ; but he could not help feeling himself
watched ; and as for Ruth, her brilliant,
expressive face showed a consciousness which
perhaps she hardly meant to conceal from
him as she looked at him with all the past in

her eyes. Kuth liked excitement, and the
situation was not quite disagreeable to her ;
but while her look thrilled Cheriton through
and through, the fact that she could give it,
broke the last thread of his bondage to her.
She made him feel with a curious revulsion
that Eupei-t was his own cousin, and that
she had tried to make him forget that she
was his cousin's wife ; and as, being a man,
he attributed far too distinct a meaning to the
glance of an excitable, sentimental girl, it
repelled him, though the pain of the repulsion
was perhaps as keen as any that she had
made him suffer. He did not betray himself,
and it was left to Jack to frown like a
thunder cloud.

When Cheriton came out of the diningroom,
Nettie pursued him into a corner, and
began abruptly, 

'* Cherry, I want to speak to you. When
Jack went to Spain did he tell you anything
about me ? "

*' Nothing that I recollect especially,"
said Cherry, sm-prised.

*' Well, I am going to tell you about it.

Mind, I think I was perfectly right, and
Jack ought to have known I should be."

'have you and Jack had a quarrel, then?"

'eyes," said Nettie, standing straight
upright, and making her communication as
she looked down on Cherry, as he sat on a
low chair. "I taught Dick to pass his
examination."

"You!"

Yes. You know he wouldn't work at
anything, and I used to make him come and
say his lessons to me  the kings of England,
you know, and the rivers, and populations,
and French verbs. Well, then, if he didn't
know them, I made him learn them till he
did. But of course he didn't wish any one
to know, so we had to get up early, and sit
in the hay-loft, or down by the bridge. I
could not help the boys knowing that Dick
and I went out together, and at last Jack
found us in Clements' hay-loft. Dick ran
away, but Jack was very angry with me, and
insulted me ; and Cherry  he went and told
papa, and they sent me to London. But I
never told the reasons because I had promised

Dick. Now, Cherry, wouldn't it have
been very Wrong to give up the chance of
doing Dick good because Jack chose to be
ridiculous ? It just made him succeed, and
perhaps he will owe it to me that he is a
respectable person, and earns his living.
Yo2t would have helped him, wouldn't you?"

'why, yes," said Cherry; 'but that is
not quite the same thing."

"Because I am a girl. Cherry, I think
it would be mean to have let that stop me.
But now he is through, I shall never do it
again, of course ; and, Cherry, indeed I
meant it just as if he had been a ploughboy."

Here Nettie hung her tall head, and her
tone grew less defiant.

But, after all, Nettie, you should not
have done what you knew granny and father
would not like," said Cherry, much puzzled
what to say to her.

"It was because papa never knew that I
told you' said Nettie rapidly.

Cheriton asked a few more questions, and
excited that Nettie had, very early in their
intimacy, taken upon herself the reform of

VOL. III. L

Dick, and had domineered over him with all
the force of a strong will over a weak one.
Nettie had acted in perfect good faith, and
had defied her brother's attack on her ; but
as the lessons went on, her instinct had
taught her that Dick found her attractive,
and came to learn to please himself, not her.
The girl had all the self-confidence of her
race, and having set her mind on what she
called '* doing good " to Dick, she defied her
own consciousness of his motives, having
begun in kindness dashed with considerable
contempt. But lazy Dick had powers of his
own, and by the time of her quarrel with
Jack, Nettie had felt herself on dangerous
ground. ' I shan't marry  no one is like
our boys," she said to herself; but there was
just a little traitorous softening and an
indefinite sense of wrong doing which had
made her seek absolution from Cheriton,
and with the peculiar absence of folly, which
was a marked characteristic of the slow-thinking
twins, she gave herself the
protection of his knowledge.

Cheriton's impulse was to take up Jack's

line and give her a good scolding, but he
was touched by her appeal, and had learned
to weigh his words carefully. He said
something rather lame and inadequate about
being more particular in future, but he gave
Nettie's hand a kind little squeeze, and she
felt herself off her own mind. It had been
a curious incident, and had done much to
make Nettie into a woman  too much of a
woman to look on lev protege with favouring
eyes. Dick, too, was likely to find other
interests, but Nettie had helped to give him
a fair stai-t, and her scot of his old faults
could never be quite forgotten.

CHAPTER XL.

A NEW SUGGESTION.

Once remember

You devoted soul and mind
To the welfare of your brethren

And the service of your kind,
Now what sorrow can you comfort ? "

Soon after the scenes recorded in the last
chapter, Alvar received a letter from Mrs.
Lester, in which she thanked him, in a
dignified and cordial manner, for his proposal
that the home at Oakby should go on
as usual, but said she did not consider that
lier residence there would be for the happiness
of any one. During her son's married
life she had lived in a house at Ashrigg,
which was part of the Lester property, and
was called The Ring. This was now again
vacant, and she proposed to take it, making

it a home for Nettie, and for any of her
grandsons who chose so to consider it. The
great sorrow of her dear son's death would
be more endurable to her, she said, anywhere
but at Oakby. The neighbourhood of the
Hubbard would provide friends for herself
and society for Nettie, who would be very
lonely at Oakby in her brothers' constant
absences. Alvar was sincerely sorry. He
was accustomed to the idea of a family home
being open to all, and did not, in any way,
regard himself as trammelled by his grandmother's
presence there, while Cheriton was
utterly taken by surprise, and hated the
additional change and uprooting. He did
not think the step unwise, especially as
regarded Nettie, but he marvelled at his
grandmother's energy in devising and resolving
on it. He had expected a great
outcry from Nettie, but she proved not to be
unprepared, and said briefly, ' that she liked
it better than staying at home now."

'' But you will not desert me ? " said
Alvar. *' Shall I drive you too away from
your home ? "

**No," said Cherry. ** No, I'll come home
for the holidays, and the boys, too, if you
will have them; though I suppose granny
will want to see us all sometimes."

* I wish that I could take you home now,"
said Alvar. 'I think you are tired with
London  you see too many people."

Cheriton coloured a little at the allusion,
but he disclaimed any wish to leave London
then, shrinking indeed from breaking through
the externals of his profession. It ended by
Alvar going down to meet his grandmother
at Oakby, and to make arrangements for the
change, during which he proved himself so
kind, courteous, and helpful to her, that he
quite won her heart ; and Nettie, on her
return, was astonished at hearing Alvar' s
judgment deferred to, and  ' my grandson "
quoted as an authority, on several occasions.

Jack, after a few days in London, joined
a reading party for the first weeks of the
vacation ; , and Bob, on his return from the
gentleman who was combining for him the
study of farming and of polite literature,
joined Nettie in London, and took her down

to Ashrigg ; so that the early part of August
found only Cheriton and Alvar at Oakby.

Cherry liked this well enough, for though
the house could not but seem forlorn and
empty to him, daily life was always pleasant
with Alvar, and he would have gladly helped
him through all the arrears of business that
came to hand. These were considerable,
for Mr. Lester's subordinates had not been
trained to go alone, and none of them
had been allowed universal superintendence.
Cheriton thought that Alvar required such
assistance, and that he ought to have an
agent with more authority ; but oddly enough
he did not take to the proposal, and
in the meantime he made mistakes, kept
decisions waiting, failed to recognize the
relative importance of different matters, and,
still worse, of different people.

One afternoon, towards the end of August,
Cheriton went over to Elderthwaite. What
with business at home, expeditions to Ash-ring,
and a great many calls on his attention
from more immediate neighbours, he had not
seen very much of the parson, and as he

neared the rectory he beheld an unwonted
sight in the field adjoining, namely, some
thirty or forty children drinking tea, under
the superintendence of Virginia and one of
the Miss Ellesmeress.

** Hallo, Cherry," said the parson, advancing
to meet him; *' where have you
been ? Seems to me we must have a grand
what d'ye call it ?  rural collation before
we can get a sight of you."

'ras you never invited me to the rural
collation, I was not aware of its existence,"
said Cherry laughing, as Virginia approached
him.

*'0h, Cherry, stay and start some games,'
she said. *you know they are so ignorant,
they never even saw a school-feast before."

'* Then, Virginia, I wonder at you for
spoiling the last traces of such refreshing
simplicity. Introducing juvenile dissipation !
Well, it doesn't seem as if the natural child
wanted much training to appreciate plumage
! "

*' No ; but if you could make the boys run
for halfpence  "

' You think they won't know a halfpenny
when they see one."

**Do have some tea!" said Lucy Ellesmere,
running up to him. *' Perhaps you are
tired, and Virginia has given them beatific
tea, and really they're very nice children,
considering''

So Cherry stayed, and advanced the
education of the Elderthwaite youth by
teaching them to hob for cherries, and other
arts of polite society, ending by showing
them how to give three cheers for the parson,
and three times three for Miss Seyton ; and
while Virginia was dismissing her flock with
final hunches of gingerbread, the parson
called him into the house.

* Poor lassie ! " he said ; ' she is fond of
the children, and thinks a great deal of doing
them good ; but it's little good she can do
in the face of what's coming."

** How do you mean ? " said Cheriton.
* Is anything specially amiss ? "

*come in and have a pipe. A glass of
wine won't come amiss after so much tea
and gingerbread."

They went into the dining-room, and the
parson poked up the fire into a blaze, for
even August afternoons were not too warm
at Elderthwaite for a fire to be pleasant, and
as he subsided into his arm-chair, he said
gravely,

'* Eh, Cherry, we Seytons have been a
bad lot  a bad lot  and the end of it '11 be
we shall be kicked out of the country."

' Oh, I hope not ! " said Cherry, quite
sincerely. *' What is the matter ? "

' Well, look round about you. Is there
a wall that's mended, or a plantation preserved
as it ought to be ? Look at the
timber  what is there left of it ? and what's
felled lies rotting on the ground for want of
carting. There's acres of my brother's hay
never was led till the rain came and spoiled
it. Look at the cottages. Queenie gets
the windows mended, but she can't make
the roofs water-tight. Look at those woods
down by the stream, why, there's not a head
of game in them, and once they were the
best preserves in the country ! "

** Things are bad, certainly," said Cherry.,

*' And yet, Cherry, we've loved the place,
and never have sold an acre of it, spite
of mortgages and everything. Well, my
brother's not long for this world. He has
been failing and failing before his time, and
though he has led a decent life enough,
things have gone more to the bad with years
of doing nothing, than with all the scandals
of my father's time."

'' Is Mr. Seyton ill ? " said Cheriton.

*not ill altogether; but mark my words,
he'll not last long. Well, at last, he was so
hard up that he wrote to Poland and I
know, Cheriton, it was the bitterest pill he
ever swallowed  and asked his consent to
selling Uplands Farm. What does Roland
do but write back and say, with all his heart ;
so soon as it came into his hands he should
sell every acre, house and lands, advowson
of living and all, and pay his debts. He
hated the place, he said, and would never
live there. Sell it to the highest bidder.
There were plenty of fortunes made in trade,
says he, that would give anything for land
and position. So there, the old place '11 go

into the hands of some purse-proud stranger.
But not the church  he shan't go restoring
and improving that with his money. I'm
only fifty-nine, and a good Hfe yet, and
I'll stick in the church till I'm put into the
churchyard ! "

Cherry smiled, it was impossible to help
it ; but the parson's story made him very sad.
He knew well enough that it was a righteous
retribution, that Poland's ownership would
be a miserable thing for every soul in Elder-thwart,
and that the most purse-proud of
strangers would do something to mend
matters ; and yet his heart ached at the downfall,
and his quick imagination pictured vividly
how completely the poor old parson would
put himself in the wrong, and what a disastrous
state of things would be sure to ensue.

** I'd try and not leave so much ' restoration
' for any stranger to do," he said.

' Eh, what's the good ? " said the parson.
'* She had better let it alone for the * new
folks'"

*nay," said Cherry, *you cannot tell if
the *new folks,' as you call them, will be

inclined for anything of the sort, and all these
changes may not take place for years. It
doesn't quite pay to do nothing because life
is rather more uncertain to oneself than to
other people."

Cheriton spoke half to himself, and the
parson went on with his own train of thought.

** Ay, I'll stick to the old place, though I
thought it a heavy clog round my neck once ;
and if you knew all the ins and outs of that
transaction, you'd say, maybe, I ought to be
kicked out of it now."

'No, I should not," said Cherry, who
knew, perhaps, more of the Elderthwaite traditions
than the parson imagined. * Things
are as they are, and not as they might have
been, and perhaps you could do more than
any one else to mend matters."

The parson looked into the fire, with an
odd, half humble, half comical expression,
and Cherry said abruptly, 

"Do you think Mr. Seyton would sell
Uplands to me ? "

"To you ? What the dickens do you
want with it ? "

u "Why  I don't think it would be a bad
speculation, and I should like, I think, to
have it."

'' What ? Does your brother make Oakby
too hot to hold you? "

'No, indeed. He is all that is kind tome,"
said Cherry indignantly. '' Every one
misconstrues him. But I should like to
have a bit of land hereabouts, all the same."

'well, you had better ask my brother
yourself. He may think himself lucky, for
I don't know who would buy a bit of land
like that wedged in between the two places.
Ah, here's Queenie to say good-night. Well,
my lassie, are you pleased with your sport ?"

*' Yes, uncle ; and the children were very
good."

Cheriton walked a little way with Virginia,
beyond the turning where they parted from
Lucy Ellesmere. He found that she was
unaware of the facts which the parson had
told him, and though somewhat uneasy
about her father, very much disposed to
dwell on the good accounts of Dick and
Harry, and on the general awakening in

the place that seemed to demand improvements.
Oakby offered a ready-made pattern,
and other farmers had been roused by Mr.
Clements to wish for changes, while some, of
course, were ready to oppose them.

' They begin to wish Uncle James would
have a curate. Cherry," she said; 'but I
don't think he ever will find one that he
could get on with. No one who did not
know all the ins and outs of the place could
get on either with him or with the people."

'' It would be difficult," said Cheriton
thoughtfully ; '' yet I do believe that a
great deal might be done for parson as well
as people."

'' Ah, Cherry," said Virginia, with a smile,
*'if you hadn't got another vocation. Uncle
James would let you do anything you liked.
I wish bijou were a clergyman, and could
come and be curate of Elderthwaite ; for you
are the only person who could fit into all the
corners."

Virginia spoke in jest, as of an impossible
vision, but Cheriton answered her with
unexpected seriousness.

** It would be hard on Elderthwaite to put
up with a failure, and an offering would not
be worth much which one had waited to
make till one had nothing left worth giving ;
I'm afraid, too, my angles are less accommodating
than you suppose  ask Alvar."

Cherry finished his sentence thoughtlessly,
and was recalled by Virginia's blush; but
she said as they parted, *' That is a safe
reference for you."

Cheriton laughed ; but as he walked
homeward he turned and looked back on the
tumble-down, picturesque village at his feet.
Loud, rough sounds of a noisy quarrel in the
little street came to his ears, and some boys
passed him manifestly the worse for drink,
though they pulled themselves up and tried
to avoid his notice. It was not quite a new
idea which Virginia had put into shape ; but
as the steep hill forced him to slacken his
steps, he could not see that the strength
which had proved insufficient for a more
selfish object was likely to be worth consecrating
to the service of his neighbours.

CHAPTER XLI.

A NEW AMBITION.

Like a young courtier of the king's  like the king's
young courtier."

In the first week of September Jack came
home, and Bob also came over from Ashrigg
to assist in demolishing the partridges.
The empty, lonely house affected the spirits
of the two lads in a way neither of them had
foreseen ; the unoccupied drawing-room, the
absence of Nettie's rapid footsteps, the
freedom from their grandmother's strictures
on dress and deportment  all seemed strange
and unnatural; and when they were not
absolutely out shooting, they hung about
disconsolately, and grumbled to Cheriton
over every little alteration. Jack, indeed,
recovered himself after a day or two, but

VOL. Ill, M

he looked solemn, and intensified Cherry's
sense that things were amiss, strongly disapproving
of his principle of non-interference.
He contrived, too, whether innocently or
not, to ask questions that exposed Alvar's
ignorance of the names and qualities of
places and people, and betrayed delays in
giving orders, misconceptions of requirements,
and many a lapse from order and
method. Moreover, the way in which some
of the excellent old dependents showed their
loyalty to the old regime, was by doing
nothing without orders. Consequently, a
hedge remained unmended till the cows got
through into a plantation, and ate the tops
off the young trees,  ' Mr. Lester had given
no order on the subject;" and a young
horse was thrown down and broke his knees
through Mr. Lester desiring the wrong-person
to exercise him. Then, of two
candidates for a situation, Alvar often
managed to choose the wrong one, and with
the sort of irritability that seemed to be
growing on him, would not put up with
suggestions.

** What ? " said Jack ; ' one of those
poaching, thieving Greens taken on as
stable-hoy ! And Jos, too  the worst of
the lot ! Why, he has been in prison
twice. A nice companion for all the other
lads about the place ! I saw little Sykes
after him this morning. I should have
thought you would have stopped that, Cherry,
at least ! "

' I did not know of it, Jack, till too late,"
said Cherry quietly.

*' Well," said Jack, driving his hands into
his pockets and frowning fiercely, ''I don't
think it's right to let such things pass without
a protest. Something will happen that
cannot be undone. I don't approve of systems
by which people's welfare is thrown into the
hands of a few ; but if they are  if you are
those few, it's  it's more criminal than many
things of which the law takes cognizance, to
neglect their interest. It's destroying the
last relics of reality, and bringing the whole
social edifice to destruction."

 What I think," said Bob, is that if a
man's a gentleman, and has been accustomed
M 2

to see things in a proper point of view, he
acts accordingly."

"A gentleman! A man's only claim to
be a gentleman is that he recognizes the
whole brotherhood of humanity and his
duties as a human being."

'' Come, I don't know," said Bob, not
quite sure where these expressions were
leading him.

'this duty to his neighbour," said
Cheriton.

' You worry yourself fifty times too much
about it all," said Jack, with vehement
inconsistency.

"Well, perhaps I do," said Cheriton,
glad to turn the conversation. " Come, tell
me how you got on in Wales, I have never
heard a word of it."

Jack looked at him for a moment, and
with something of an effort began to talk
about his reading party ; but presently he
warmed with the topic, and Cherry brightened
into animation at the sound of familiar
names and former interests ; they began to
laugh over old jokes, and quarrel over old

subjects of disputation ; and they were
talking fast and eagerly against each other,
with a sort of chorus from Bob, when, looking
up. Cherry suddenly saw Alvar standing
before them with a letter in his hand.

He was extremely pale, but his eyes
blazed with such intensity of wrath, became
up to them with a gesture expressive of such
passion, that they all started up ; while he
burst out, 

* I have to tell you that I am scorned, injured,
insulted. My grandfather has died  "

* Your grandfather, Don Guzman ? Alvar,
I am sorry," exclaimed Cheriton ; but Alvar
interrupted him, 

*' Sorrow insults me ! I learn that he
has made his will, that he leaves all to
Manoel, that I  I, his grandson  am not fit
to be his heir, ' since I am a foreigner and a
heretic, and unfit to be the owner of Spanish
property.' "

*' That seems very unjust," said Cheriton,
as Alvar paused for a moment.

' Unjust ! " cried Alvar. ** I am the
victim of injustice. Here and there  it is

the same thing. I have been silent yes,
yes  but I will not bear it. I will be what I
please, myself  there, here, everywhere ! "

'' Nay, Alvar," said Cherry gently; 'there
at least, you have met with no injustice."

And why?" cried Alvar, with the sudden
abandonment of passion which now and then
broke through his composure. '' You are
doubtless too honourable to plot and scheme;
but your thoughts and your wishes, are they
not the same  the same as this most false
and unnatural traitor, who has stolen from
me my inheritance and my grandfather's
love ? What do you wish, my brothers 
wish in your hearts  would happen to the
intruder, the stranger, who takes your lands
from you ? Would you not see me dead at
your feet? "

"We never wished you were dead," said
Bob indignantly, as Alvar walked about the
room, threw out his hands with vehement
gestures, stamped his foot, and gave way to
a violence of expression that would have
seemed ludicrous to his brothers but for the
fury of passion, which evidently grew with

every moment, as if the injury of years was
finding vent. All the strong temper of his
father seemed roused and expressed with a
rush of vindictive passion, his southern blood
and training depriving him at once of self-consciousness
and self-control.

'what matter what you wish? Am I
not condemned to a life which I abhor, to a
place that is hateful to me, despised by one
whose feet I would kiss, disliked by you all,
insulted by those who should be my slaves ?
What is this country to me, or I to it ? I
care not for your laws, your magistrates,
your people  who hate me, who would shoot
me if they dared. And this  this  has lost
me the place where I was as good as others.
I lose my home for this  for you who stand
together and wonder at me. I curse that
villain who has robbed me ; I curse the fate
that has made me doubly an outlaw ; most
of all, I curse my father, whose neglect  "

*' Silence ! " said Cheriton ; *' you do not
speak such words in our presence."

The flood of Alvar's words, half Spanish,
half English, had fairly silenced the three

brothers with amazement. Now he faced
round furiously on Cheriton, 

''1 will speak"

*you will not" said Cheriton, grasping
his hand, and looking full in his face.
*you forget yourself, Alvar. Don't say
what we could never forget or forgive."

But Alvar flung him ofl" with a violence
and scorn that roused the two lads to fury,
and made Cheriton' s own blood tingle as
Jack sprang forward, 

*' I won't have that," he said, in a tone
as low as Alvar 's was high, but to the full
as threatening.

*i'll give you a licking if you touch my
brother," shouted Bob, with a rough, schoolboy
enforcement of the threat.

*hush!" said Cheriton; ' for God's
sake, stop  all of you ! We are not boys
now, to threaten each other. Stop, while
there is time. Stand back, I say, Jack, and
be silent ! "

The whole thing had passed in half a
minute ; Alvar' s own furious gesture had
sobered him, and he threw himself into a

seat ; while Cheriton's steady voice and look
controlled the two lads, and gave Jack time
to recollect himself.

There was a moment's silence. Then
Alvar stood up, bowed haughtily, like a
duellist after the encounter, and walked out
of the room. Jack, after a minute, broke
into an odd, harsh laugh, and, pushing open
the window, leant out of it.

'one wants air. That was a critical
moment," he said.

I'll not stand that sort of thing ; I'll go
back to Ashrigg ; I'll not come here again'*
said Bob. 'what did you stop us for.
Cherry, when we were going to show him a
piece of our minds ? "

I did not think anybody's mind was fit to
be exhibited," said Cheriton. "Don't begin
to quarrel with me too. Bob ; and do not go
away to-day on any account."

"Well!" said Bob; "if you like such
a hollow peace  but I'll not shoot his
partridges, nor ride his horses ; I'll go
for a walk, and I shan't come in to
dinner ! '*

Bob flung out of the room, banging the
door behind him.

At first the other two hardly spoke a word
to each other. Cherry sat down a little
apart, and mechanically took up a newspaper.
Jack sat in the window, and as his heat subsided,
thought over the scene that had passed.
He felt that it was more than a foolish outburst
of violent temper ; it had been a
revelation to themselves and to each other
of a state of feeling that it seemed to him
impossible any longer to ignore. He knew
that Cheriton's presence of mind had saved
them from words and actions that might
have parted them for ever; but what was
the use of pretending to get on with Alvar
after such a deadly breach ? Better leave
him to do the best he could in his own way,
and go theirs. And Jack's thoughts turned
to his own way in the future that he hoped
for, success and congenial labour, and sweet
love to brighten it. After all, a man's early
home was not everything to him. And then
he looked towards Cheriton, who had dropped
his newspaper, and sat looking dreamily before

him, with a sad look of disappointment on
his face.

' What are you going to do, Cherry ? "
said Jack.

*'Do? Nothing. What can I do?"
said Cherry. Then he added, 'ewe must
not make too much of what passed to-day ;
let us all try and forget it. Alvar has been
ill-treated, and we are none of us so gentle
as not to know what a little additional
Spanish fire might make of us."

To be rough with you ! " said Jack.

Oh, that was accidental. It is the
terrible resentment. There, I did not mean
to speak of it. Let us get out into the air,
and shake it off."

'rit is too wet and cold for you," said
Jack, looking out.

Cheriton flushed at the little check with
an impatience that showed how hardly the
scene had borne on him.

"Nonsense; don't be fanciful," he said.
*' It won't hurt me  what if it did ? "

Jack followed him in silence, and as they
walked Cherry talked resolutely of other

matters, though with long pauses of silence
between.

In the meantime Alvar endured an agony
of self-disgust. He could not forgive himself
for his loss of dignity, nor his brothers
for having witnessed it. Cheriton had conquered
him, and the thought rankled so as
to obscure even the love he bore him ; while
all the bitter and vindictive feelings, never
recognized as sinful, took possession of him,
and held undisputed sway. He was enough
of an Englishman to reject his first impulse
of rushing back to Seville and calling out his
cousin and fighting him. After all, the bitterness
was here; and at dinner-time he
appeared silent and sullen in manner.
Cheriton looked ill and tired, and could
hardly eat ; but Alvar offered no remark on
it, and the younger boys (for Bob did come
back) were shy and embarrassed. Alvar
answered when Cheriton addressed him with
a sort of stiff politeness, and by the next
morning had resumed a more ordinary demeanour;
but when Bob again suggested
going back to Ashrigg, Cheriton and Jack



agreed that he had better do so, only
charging him not to let Nettie or their
grandmother guess at any quarrel.

'rand, Cherry," Jack said, ' suppose we
come somewhere together for a little while ?
A little sea air would do you good  and you
could help me with my reading. No one
could think it strange, and I am sure you
want rest and quiet."

''No, Jack," said Cherry. "It is very
good of you, my boy, but  111 try a little
longer. Alvar and I could not come together
again if I went away now, and I'll not give
up hoping that after all things may right
themselves. Think of all he has been to me.
But you must do as you think best yourself."

I shall not leave you here without me,"
said Jack; "but I don't see the use of
staying."

Well I shall stay," said Cherry.

Alvar never alluded again to his letter
from Spain ; and the others were afraid to
start the subject. He was very polite to
them, and together they formed engagements,
went over to Ashrigg and led their

lives in the usual manner; but there was no
real approach, and Cheriton missed Alvar's
caressing tenderness, and the tact that had
always been exercised on his behalf.

He did not, with all this worry, find as
much strength to face the coming winter ashe
had hoped for, and while he thought that
going back to London would put an end to
the present discomfort, he believed that he
would do no good there ; and would not a
parting from Alvar now be a real separation ?

Alvar, meanwhile, took a fit of attending to
business. He spent much time about the
place, insisted on being consulted on all
subjects, and still more on being instantly
obeyed ; king Log had vanished, and a very
peremptory king Stork appeared in his place.
The gentle, courteous, indifferent Alvar
seemed possessed with a captious and
resentful spirit that brooked no opposition.
No one had ever dared to disobey Mr.
Lester's orders; but then they had been
given with a due regard to possibility, and
often after consultation with those by whom
they were to be obeyed.

Alvar now proved himself to be equally
determined ; but he was often ignorant of
what was reasonable and of what was not,
and though the sturdy north countrymen
had given in against their inclination to
their superior, they thought it very hard to
be driven against their judgment when they
were right and ' t' strange squire" was
wrong, or at least innovating. Now Alvar
did know something about horses, and his
views of stable management differed somewhat
from those prevailing at Oakby, and
being based on the experience of a different
climate and different conditions, were not always
applicable there, and could only of course
be carried, as it were, at the sword's point.

Full of this new and intense desire to
feel himself master, and to prove himself
so, Alvar not unnaturally concentrated his
efforts on the one subject where he had
something to say. He could not lay down
the law about turnips and wheat; but he
did think that he knew best how to treat the
injuries the young horse had received by his
own mistaken order.

Perhaps he did ; but so did not think old
Bill Fisher, who had been about the stables
ever since he was twelve, and who, though
past much active work, still considered
himself an authority from which there was
no appeal.

Alvar visited the horse, and desired a
certain remedy to be applied to a sprained
shoulder, taking some trouble to explain how
it was to be made.

Old Bill listened in an evil silence, and
instead of saying that so far as he knew one
of the ingredients was unattainable at Oakby,
or giving his master an alternative, said
nothing at all in reply to Alvar' s imperious 
*remember, this must be done at once;"
but happening soon after to encounter
Cheriton, requested him to visit the horse,
and desired his opinion of the proper treatment.


Cheriton, ignorant of what had passed,
naturally quoted the approved remedy at
Oakby, adding, 

*why, Bill, I should have thought you
would have known that for yourself."

'ray, no one ever heard tell of no other,"
muttered the old man, proceeding to apply
it with some grumbling about strangers,
which Cheriton afterwards bitterly rued
having turned a deaf ear to.

The next morning Alvar went to see if his
plans had been carried out, and discovering
how his orders had been disregarded, turned
round, and said sternly, 

'' How have you dared to disobey me ? "

'eh, sir," said Bill, rather appalled at
his master's face, "this stuff's cured our
horses these fifty year."

"You have disobeyed me," said Alvar,
"and I will not suffer it. I dismiss you
from my service  you may go. I will not
forgive you."

Old Bill lifted up his bent figure, and
stared at his master in hitter amaze.

I served your honour's grandfather  me
and mine," he said.

You cannot obey me. What are your
wages ? I will pay them  you may go."

Neither the old man himself, nor the
helpers who had begun to gather round,

VOL. HI. N

belonged to a race of violent words, or indeed
of violent deeds ; but there was more hate in
the faces that were turned on Alvar than would
have winged many an Irish bullet. All were
silent, till a little brother of Cherry's friends,
the Flemings, called out, saucily enough, 

 'Twas Mr. Cherry's orders."

As if stung beyond endurance, Alvar
turned, caught the boy by the shoulder, and
raising his cane, struck him once, twice,
several times, with a violence of which he
himself was hardly conscious.

This was the scene that met Cheriton's
startled eyes as he came up to the stable to
inquire for the sick horse.

He uttered a loud exclamation of astonishment
and dismay, and put his hand on
Alvar' s shoulder.

Alvar, with a final blow, threw the lad
away from him, and faced round on Cheriton,
drew himself up, and folded his arms, as he
said, regardless of the spectators 

'I will not have it that you interfere
with me, to alter my orders, or to stop mein
what I do. You shall not do it."

*' I have never interfered with you ! " cried
Cheriton fiercely. *' Assuredly I never will.
I  I  " He checked himself with a strong
effort, and said, very low, ' We are forgetting
ourselves by disputing here. If you have
anything to say to me, it can be said at a
better moment."

Then, without trusting himself with a word
or look, he walked slowly away.

Alvar said emphatically, 

Remember, I have said what I desire,"
and turned off in another direction; while
those left behind held such an * indignation
meeting " as Oakby had never seen.

NO USE.

Learn that each duty makes its claim
Upon one soul, not each on all ;
How if God speaks thy brother's name,
Dare thou make answer to the call '? "

Cheriton" had encountered greater sorrows,
he had met with more startling disappointments,
but never, perhaps, had he endured
such a complication of feeling as when he
turned away and left Alvar in the stable
yard. Perhaps he had never been so angry,
for Alvar 's accusation was peculiarly galling,
peculiarly hard to forgive, and impossible to
forget. And then there was the bitter sense
of utter failure  failure of influence, of tact,
of affection, and, in so far as he identified
himself with the place and the people, there
was yet a deeper sense of injury. Every old

prejudice, every old distaste, surged up in
his mind, and yet he loved Alvar well
enough to sharpen the sting. He walked on
faster and faster, till want of breath stopped
him, and brought on one of the fits of
coughing to which overrate or agitation
always rendered him liable. He just
managed to get back to the house and into
the library, where Jack started up, as he
threw himself into a chair.

' Cherry, what is the matter ? "

Cherry could not speak for a moment;
and Jack, much frightened, exclaimed, 

*what have you been doing? Let me
call Alvar."

Cheriton caught his arm as he turned
away; and, after a few moments, as he
began to get his breath, 

** Don't be frightened. I walked tod fast
up hill."

'* How could you be so foolish ? "

* Jack, I suppose I must tell you ; indeed,
I want to find out the rights of it ; and I can
ask no questions," he added, with a sudden
hurry in his accent.

*what do you mean? What has
happened ? "

The instinct of not irritating Jack enabled
Cheriton to control his own indignation, and
he said very quietly,  

"When I went up to the stable I found
Alvar giving little Chris Fleming a tremendous
licking. He was very much vexed with me
for  I suppose for trying to interpose ; but
there were so many people about that we
could not discuss it there. I wish you
would go and ask old Bill what Chris had
been doing, then come and tell me. Don't
say anything to Alvar about it."

Jack was keen enough to see that this was
not quite an adequate account of the matter.
He saw that Cheriton was deeply moved in
some way ; but he was so unfit for discussion
just then, that Jack thought the best course
was to hurry off on his errand.

He came back in about half-an-hour,
looking very serious too much so to be
ready to improve the occasion.

"Alvar has given old Bill warning  do
you know that ? "

''No. What was that for?" cried
Cheriton, starting up.

'' He would not speak a word to me, and
Chris had gone off to his brother's; but John
Symonds told me what had passed." Here
Jack repeated the story of the ointment,
old Bills disobedience, and Chris's declaration
that it had been done by Cheriton 's
orders.

Cheriton's face cleared a little.

**Ah, I understand now. No wonder
Alvar was vexed ! I can explain that easily.
But old Bill, it teas very unjustifiable ; but
if Alvar will not overlook it I do believe it
will kill him."

'I don't see what he would have to live
on," said Jack. '' You know that bad son
spent his savings. But Alvar will let him
off if you ask him, I daresay."

'' I think you had better do so," said
Cheriton quietly.

At this moment Alvar came into the room,
and Cheriton addressed him at once.

*' Altars when old Bill asked me about the
ointment, I did not know that you had been

giving any orders about it. I am very sorry
for the mistake."

'rit is not of consequence," said Alvar.
**Do not trouble yourself about it."

The words were kind, but the tone was less
so; and there was something inAlvar's manner
which made it difficult even for Jack to say, 

'' I'm afraid old Bill Fisher was provoking.
He should have told you that he could not
get the stuff ; but he is such an old servant,
and so faithful. I hope you won't dismiss
him for it. He seems to belong to us altogether."


'' I shall not change," said Alvar.

'' But it's an extremely harsh measure,
and will make every one about the place
detest you," said Jack, still considering
himself to be speaking with praiseworthy
moderation.

'* I will judge myself of the measure."

Then Cherry conquered his pride, and
said pleadingly, 

** I wish it very much."

I am sorry to grieve you," said Alvar,
more gently; 'but I have determined."

'* Well' said Jack, losing patience, *ewe
spoke as much for your sake as for Bill's.
Every one will consider it harsh dealing and
a great shame. You'll make them hate
you."

'' I will make them fear me," said Alvar.

** Claptrap and nonsense ! " said Jack; but
Cheriton interposed, 

* Hush, Jack, we have no right to say
any more. What must be must."

To do Alvar justice, he was not aware how
deeply he was grieving Cheriton ; he felt
himself to be asserting his rights, and in the
worst corner of his heart knew that any
relenting would be ascribed to his brother's
influence.

It was a very miserable day. After some
hours of astonished sulking, the poor old
groom put his pride in his pocket, and came
humbly * to beg t' squire's pardon," and to
entreat Cheriton to intercede for him, recapitulating
his years of long service, and
his recollections of the old squire's boyhood,
till he nearly broke Cherry's heart ; and
induced him to promise to make another

attempt at interceding  a promise which was
not given without quite as severe a rebuke
as Alvar had ever inflicted, for disrespect to
his master's orders.

He was closely followed by the eldest of
the Fleming brothers, in great indignation.

Nowhere but at Oakby, as the young man
took care to observe, would Chris have been
allowed to take such a situation, in spite of his
love of horses, and troublesomeness at home.

/ Chris was impertinent to Mr. Lester,"
saidCheriton, hardly knowing what line to take.

Young Fleming was very sorry ; in that
case he was better at home, and he hoped it
would not be inconvenient if he took him
away at once.

*' I suppose it might be best," said
Cheriton, thoroughly sympathizing with the
grievance, and thankful to Fleming for not
obliging him to hear or say much about it.

Then, sir, maybe you will tell the
squire that such is our wish."

''No; I think you had better write him a
note about it."

The two young men looked at each other,

and though Cheriton turned his eyes quickly
away, he knew well enough that Fleming
understood the whole matter.

'ras you please, sir," he said; "I
wouldn't wish for tjoii to be annoyed, Mr.
Cherry, and so I'll keep out of the squire's
way. But Westmoreland men are not black
slaves, which no doubt the squire is accustomed
to, and accounts for his conduct. It's
plain, sir, to any one that can read the
newspapers, that there's no liberty in foreign
parts, where they're all slaves and papists.
Education, sir, teaches us that. And folks
do remark that the squire doesn't keep his
church as others do ; and I have heard that
he means to establish a Popish chapel like
the one at Kavenscroft."

Then you have heard the greatest piece
of nonsense that ever was invented. Education
might cure you of such notions," said
Cherry. "You must do as you think best
for Chris. I am very sorry."

The last words were involuntary, and
Cherry hurried away before he was betrayed
into any further discussion.

Some hours later, as it was growing dusk,
he was lying on the window-seat in the
library, thinking of how he could plead old
Fisher's cause without giving offence, and
coming slowly to the conclusion that his
presence there was doing far more harm
than good, that he was risking peace with
Alvar, and had better give up the struggle,
when Alvar himself came into the room, and
came up to him.

*rare you not well?" he said, rather
constrainedly.

' Only very tired."

*what have you been doing?" said
Alvar, sitting down on the end of the broad-cushioned
seat, and looking at him.

The words certainly gave an opening ; but
Cheriton, famous all his life for the most
audacious coaxing, could not summon a
smile or a joke.

** I have been tired all day," he said, to
gain time for reflection.

*' See," said Alvar suddenly, *you are
unhappy about this old man, whom I have
dismissed."

"Yes. I don't defend him, far from it;
but he is old and crotchet, and I think
you were harsh with him," said Cherry
resolutely.

** But it is I who should decide what to do
with him," said Alvar.

' Of course. Don't imagine I dispute it,"
said Cheriton, thinking this assertion rather
foolish.

' You tell me that I should be master ;
you have told me so often. Well, then, I
can be harsh to my servants if I please."

"If you please, remembering that you
and they serve the same Master above."

Alvar paused for a moment, then said, 

"I do not please, at present. I have
grieved you, as when I hurt Buffer. I will
not be ruled by any one, but the old man
shall live in his cottage, and have his wages ;
but he shall not come into the stables nor
near my horses. Does that please you, my
brother ? "

Cherry had his doubts as to how old Bill
might regard or fulfil the conditions, and
certainly forbidding a servant to do any

work was rather an odd way of punishing
him ; hut he answered gratefully, 

'' Yes, thank you, you have taken a great
weight off my mind."

'you cough," said Alvar, after a few
moments ; "the weather is getting too cold
for you."

I thought," said Cherry, forcing himself
to take advantage of the excuse, " that I
would go to the sea for a little while before
the winter."

"Yes; where shall we go ? " said Alvar,
in a tone of interest. ' ' Look, ' ' he continued,
with wonderful candour ; ' ' here we vex
each other because we do not think the
same. We are angry with each other ; but
we will come away, and I will take care of
you. Then you shall go to London, and I
shall come back, and you will see, I will
yet be the squire. Where shall we go, mi
caw''

It was almost a dismissal, and so Cheriton
felt it to be ; but after all it was his own
decision, and the return of Alvar 's old
kindness was very comfortable to him.

**I had hardly thought about that," he
said.

'well," returned Alvar, 'ewe can talk
about it. Now, it is cold here in the
window ; come nearer to the fire and rest till
dinner-time."

As Cheriton sat up and looked out at the
stormy sunset, he saw little Chris Fleming
coming up the path that led round to the
back door.

"Ah," said Alvar cheerfully, following
his eyes, " I do not wish to punish that boy
any more. He has had enough, that little
rascal."

Evidently, Alvar's conscience was quite at
ease, and he did ngt suppose that he had in
any way compromised himself. He began
to perceive that Alvar had his own ideas as
to what would make him really master of
Oakby.

Just after dinner a note was brought to
Alvar.

If you please, sir, this note was found in
the passage, just inside the back door."

Alvar took the letter, lit one of the candles

on the chimney-piece, and proceeded to read
it.

"Moor End Farm, Sept. 29th.

Honoured Sir,  After the events of this morning,
I consider it for the best that my brother Christopher
should leave your service at once. I have no objection
to forfeit any wages due to him, as I do not feel able
to give the usual month's notice after what has passed.
I remain, honoured sir,

Your obedient servant,

Edward Fleming."

Alvar coloured deeply as he read. '* What
is this ? " he exclaimed. " May I not punish
even a little boy, who insults me ? Look ! "
and he threw the letter to his brother.

*' It is very awkward," said Cheriton.

' I think it is insolent," said Alvar.

*' I think there is a great effort to avoid
any want of respect in the letter."

** To take the boy away because he was
punished ! "

'* "Well, Alvar, if you or I were in Ned
Fleming's place, we shouldn't have liked it."

'did you know that this letter was
coming ? "

'eyes, I did."

'sit is perhaps as you have advised
Fleming?"

*' No. I gave him no advice ; but I knew
he would not let the boy stay here."

'' Do you then approve ? " said Alvar, in a
curious sort of voice.

'' From their point of view  yes. You
are right in saying that you must make yourself
felt as the master ; but there is no good
in enforcing your authority in a way that is
not customary, to say the least of it. In
England we can't lay hands on other people ;
and they might have summoned you for an
assault, you know."

'what! before a judge ? "

'before a magistrate."

*'I?" exclaimed Alvar, in a tone of such
amazement that Cheriton nearly laughed.
'' Who would Hsten to that little boy against
me, who am a gentleman and his master ? "

'' The little boy is your equal in the eyes
of the law, and might meet with more
attention just because you are his master.
Not that I mean tg say it would not be
regarded as very annoying to convict you,"

VOL. III. o

said Cheriton, thinking of the feelings of
Sir John Hubbard on such an emergency.

'I will myself be a magistrate," said
Alvar.

*that you never will," said Cherry,
losing patience, ' while these stories get
about, for no one would trust you."

*can I not be a magistrate if I choose ? "

Not unless the Lord Lieutenant gives
you a commission, of course."

* I think there is power for every one but
me ! " said Alvar. ' I may not punish that
little  what is your word?  vulgar, common
boy. I do not like so much law. Gentlemen
should do as they wish. You talk so
much about my being landlord and squire.
What is the use of it if I may not do as I
will ? Well, I will send away Fleming from
his farm  that is mine at least."

 I am afraid he has a twenty-one years
lease in it," said Cheriton, rather wickedly,
and Alvar, fancying himself laughed at,
suddenly put the letter in his pocket and
turned away, as the gon* sounded for dinner.
He disappeared afterwards when they went

back to the library, and Cheriton had the forbearance
to abstain from giving Jack the
benefit of Alvar's peculiar views on the
British constitution, though they could not
fail to speak of the events of the morning,
and Jack said, 

* Well, at least he has heard reason about
old Bill, and that was of most consequence ;
but I should think you would be glad to be
back in London, and out of the way of
it all."

**I am not quite sure about London,
Jack," said Cheriton, after a moment.

' What, don't you feel well enough ? "

*'I don't think I shall ever be good for
much there; and besides  I think I should like
to talk to you a little. Jack, if you'll listens

swell?"

'you know how I always looked forward
to settling in London, and how Uncle
Cheriton wished it, and meant to help me
on. In fact I never thought of anything
else."

Yes, I know," said Jack, briefly.

'' There was a time when I desired that


sort of success intensely, and when things
were very much changed for me, I thought
it would still  be satisfactory."

*eyes?"

*but of course, as you know, I soon
perceived that the hard continuous work,
necessary for anything like success, was quite
out of the question for me  I feel sure that
it always will be; and, moreover, I never
felt well in London. I was much better
here when I first came back."

Poor Jack looked as if the disappointment
were much fresher and harder to him than
to the speaker himself.

'you must know," Cheriton continued,
'that a doctor once told me at Oxford that
the damp soft air there was very bad for a
native of such a place as this, and I see now
that the last few months there began the
mischief; and London has something the
same effect on me. That seems to settle the
question."

''I suppose so," said Jack, so disconsolately,
that Cherry half smiled, as he
resumed, 

** Otherwise the pleasant idle life there
might have its charms. Though, after all,
Jack, I shouldn't like it as things are now.
When I expected to be a London man, I
expected, as you know  a good deal else.
And afterwards even, while all home ties
here were safe and sound, one would not get
selfish and aimless. But now I couldn't be
happy, I think, without a home-world that
really belonged to me."

*sand so home is being spoilt for you
too ? " said Jack.

'' I see," returned Cheriton, that it won't
do. If Alvar is left to himself here, he will
fight his way now, I think, to some ineans
of managing proper to himself."

** Or improper," said Jack.

* Well, to be honest, I am afraid he will
make a great many mistakes, and do a great
deal of mischief. But if I where here  I
mean if this place were still to be home tome
so that I still felt  as I should feel  a
personal concern in all the old interests,
Alvar would quarrel with me. I might prevent
individual evils ; but in the long run I

should do harm. He thought at first that I
should guide hmi. Perhaps I thought so
too ; but it is a false and impossible relation,
and it must be put a stop to."

*but, Cherry, I think father looked to
you to keep things straight."

*eyes," said Cherry, 'but not to make
them more crooked, by such disputes as we
have had lately."

Cheriton spoke resolutely, though with a
quiver of the lip, and Jack could guess well
enough at the pain the resolve was costing him.
'* Alvar is quite changed to you ! " he said,
savagely.

"Yes, because he himself is changing.
He is different in many ways, and conscious
of all sorts of difficulties."

But what do you mean to do ? "

Oh, nothing desperate, nothing till the
winter is over. Probably I shall go to the
sea with Alvar, as he suggests. Then if I am
pretty well, I shall go and see granny. I
have a notion that I should be better herein
the cold weather than in London. I want
to try."

 ' Had jon all this in your mind when you
settled to buy Uplands ? " said Jack suddenly.

'eyes in part I had."

But, you are not thinking of living
there ! What are you driving at, Cherry, I
can't understand you ? "

"Well, Jack," said Cherry, slowly and
with rising colour, "I will tell you, but I
wanted to show you the process. And you
must remember that it is only an idea
known to no one, and very probably may
prove impossible, perhaps undesirable."

Tell me," said Jack, more gently. Any
scheme for the future was a relief from
listening to the laying aside of hopes which
he knew had been so much a part of Cheriton's
being.

"Well," said Cherry again, "I'm afraid
my motives are rather poor ones. You see,
after Oakby there's no place for me like
Elderthwaite. I want the feeling, as I say,
of a place and neighbours of my own. I
suppose I am used to playing first fiddle,
and to looking after other people's concerns.
Granny always said I was a gossip. Then

Ism narrow-minded, perhaps I have had too
much taken out of me to thmk of starting
fresh. And you know the old parson will
always put up with me, and so will Elder-thwart
people. And I want an object in life
if you knew how dreary it is to be without
one ! If they had a strange curate he would
set them all by the ears, and the parson
would make a fool of himself! So if Mr.
Ellesmere thinks the bishop would consent,
and approves, and if I am fit for anything, I
thought that I would try."

Jack was silent for some moments. He
understood Cheriton well enough to ' ' follow
the process," but it affected him strongly,
and at last he said, gravely, 

** I am afraid all the vexation here has
put this into your head."

** Partly," said Cherry, simply, ' this
actual thing. I can't say anything of other
motives of course, Jack. I know that it
looks like, that in fact it is turning to this 
which ought to be the offering of all one's
best  when other careers have failed me.
And I know that those who sympathize the

least will be the most inclined to say so.
But it is not quite so. I have always wished
to be of use, of service, here especially. I
thought I saw how. I have the same wish
still, and this seems to offer me a way. It
is but a gathering up of the fragments, but I
trust He will accept."

Jack's view rather was that the plan was
not good enough for his brother, than that
his brother was not good enough for it.

** You were always good enough for
anything, if that is what you mean' he
said. 'but I do understand. Cherry, about
wanting an object; only  only it's such an
odd one."

'*I tell you," said Cherry, brightly, for
the disclosure was a great relief to him,
'that that's the very point. I don't think
I get on amiss with any one, even with the
Sevillaiios, but down at the bottom of my
heart. Jack, I'm not far removed  we none
of us are  from " There's a stranger, 'eave
'als a brick at him," and when I think of any
direct dealing with people, anything like
clerical work, why, except to my own kith

and kin, I should have nothing to say. The
self-denial of missionaries seems to me
incredible. I could not do as Bob means todo,
I think, if health and strength were to bethe
reward of it. It's a very unworthy
weakness, I know, but I can't help it."

* You would get on very well anywhere,"
said Jack; 'that is all nonsense. I don't
believe Elderthwaite would agree with you,
and you could overwork yourself just as well
there as anywhere else."

*swell, as to the place agreeing with me,
that remains to be proved. It's a very small
church, and a small place; and I hope I
might be able to do the little they are fit
for  at present. But I know it may prove
to be out of the question."

Jack was silent. He could not bear to
vex Cherry by opposing a scheme which
seemed to offer him some pleasure in the
midst of his annoyances, and if his brother
had proposed to take orders with more
ordinary expectations, it would have been
quite in accordance with the Oakby code of
what was fitting. But there was something

in the consecration of what Cheriton evidently
Viewed as a probably short life and failing
powers to an object so unselfish, and yet, as
it seemed to Jack, so commonplace, it was
so like Cherry, and yet showed such a
conquest of himself  there was such humility
in the acknowledgment that he was only just
fit for the sort of imperfect work that offered
itself, and yet such a complete sense that no
one else could manage that particular bit of
work so well  it was, as Jack said, ' so
odd," that it thrilled him through and
through, and he was glad that Alvar's
entrance saved him from a reply.

CHAPTER XLIII.

REVENGE.

' 'Now, look you,' said my brother, * you may talk.
Till, weary with the talk, I answer nay.' "

Alvar, having avoided his brothers after
dinner, came back into the hall, and, sitting
down by the fire, lighted a cigarette. As he
sat there in the great chair by himself, the
flames flickering on the oak panels, and the
subdued light of the lamp failing to penetrate
the dark corners of the old hall, his face took
an expression of melancholy, and there was
an air of loneliness about his solitary figure
a loneliness which was not merely external.
He was perplexed and unhappy, and the fact
that his unhappiness had roused in his breast
pride and jealousy and anger, did not make
it less real. He had not come to the point

of owning himself in the wrong, and yet he
felt puzzled. He could not see how he had
offended. It was a critical moment. Gentle
and affectionate as Cheriton was, and happy
as the relations had hitherto been between
them, Alvar felt himself judged and condemned
by his brother's higher standard,
now that he had at last become aware of its
existence. He had never been distressed by
Virginia's way of looking at things, she was
a woman, and her views could not affect his ;
and for a long time, as has been said, he
had regarded Cheriton's ideas of duty as as
much an idiosyncrasy as his fair complexion,
or his affection for KoUa and Buffer. Now
he perceived that Cheriton himself did not
so regard them, but with whatever excuses
and limitations, expected them to be binding
on Alvar himself; and Alvar's whole nature
kicked against the criticism. Cheriton had
been clear-sighted enough to perceive this,
and so judged it better to draw back ; but
Alva;, through clouds and darkness, had
seen a glimpse of the light. He knew that
Cheriton was right, and the knowledge irritated

him. In a fitful, dark sort of way he
tried to assert his independence and yet
justify himself to Cheriton. It was doubtful
whether he would gradually follow the light
thus held out to him, or decidedly turn away
from it, and just now his wounded pride
prompted him to the latter course. He
would go his own way ; and when he had
settled his affairs to his mind, his brothers
should own that he was right. And yet 
did he not owe a debt, never to be forgotten,
to the kind hand that had welcomed him,
the bright face that had smiled on him, long
ago, on that dreary Christmas Eve ? Alvar
did not say to himself, as he perhaps might
have done with truth, that he had repaid
Cheriton' s early kindness to him tenfold ; but
he thought of the joyous, active youth, whose
animal spirits, constant activity, and frequent
laughter had been such a new experience to
him.

As Alvar thought how great the change
had been, his softer feelings revived, and
with them the instinct of caring for his
brother's comfort in a thousand trifling ways.

He remembered that Cheriton had hardly
eaten any dinner, and rose, intending to goto
him and persuade him to have some of
the chocolate for which he had never lost
the liking gained in Spain. As he moved
towards the library the butler came into the
hall, and, with some excitement, told him
that Fletcher, his farm baihfif, wanted to
speak to him.

' But it is too late," said Alvar. 'He
may come tomorrow."

'* Indeed, sir, I think it is of consequence.
Some ill-disposed persons, sir, have set one
of your ricks on fire, as I understand," said
the butler, with the air of elevation with
which the news of any misdemeanour is
usually communicated.

'* Tell him, then, to come in," said Alvar,
coolly ; and Fletcher appearing, deposed that
a certain valuable hay-rick, in a field about
a mile from the house, on a small farm called
Howell, which had always been managed,
together with the home farm, by Mr. Lester
himself, had been discovered by one of the
men going home from work to be on fire. In

spite of all their-efforts, a great part had been
burnt, and the rest much injured by the
water used to put out the fire.

* And how did the hay catch fire ? " asked
Alvar, with composure.

** Well, sir, that young lad Fleming was
found hanging about behind a hedge, as
soon as we had eyes for anything but the
flames ; and after this morning's work, and
words that many have heard him drop, the
constable thought it his duty to take him upon
suspicion, and he is in the lock-up at
Hazelbyby."

Fletcher eyed his master as he spoke, to
see how the intelligence would be received.

**Ah, then," said Alvar, *she will be sent
to prison."

'* The magistrates meet on Thursday, sir
day after tomorrow; but arson being a
criminal offence, he'll be committed for trial
at quarter sessions," said Fletcher, in an
instructive manner. ** Wilfully setting fire
to property we name arson, sir ; the sentence
is transportation for a term of years,
sir."

'* It is the passion of revenge," said Alvar,
calmly. '' It does not surprise me."

Fletcher looked as if the squire surprised
him greatly; but Alvar wished him goodnight,
and dismissed him.

* Why  the old squire would have been
np at Howell and counted the very sticks
of hay that was left ! " he thought to himself
as he withdrew ; while Alvar went and communicated
the intelligence to his brothers.

Cheriton listened, dismayed, while Jack
exclaimed, 

''I don't believe it! No Fleming ever
was such a fool."

' But he was angry with me," said Alvar.
** He might have stabbed me out of revenge."

*' Nonsense ! we don't live in Ireland, nor
in Spain either ! They'll never forgive you,
of course, to their dying day, but they won't
put you in the right by breaking the law 
we're too far north for that."

' Fletcher doesn't belong to these parts,
you know," said Cherry; ''He might take
up an idea. I do think it most unlikely that
a boy brought up like Chris would commit

VOL. III. p

such an act. Besides, we saw him down
here. When was the fire seen ? "

**I do not know," said Alvar; *but
Fletcher said that he was there."

*' It can't be," said Cheriton; ' I cannot
believe it. But they'll never get over
the boy being [taken up at all. Why on
earth did they never let us know what was
going on ! I wish I had been there."

** Yes; a fire, and for us never to know of
it ! " said Jack,[regretfully.

I think that Chris is a bad boy, and
that he has done it," said Alvar. 'Butl
do not care about the hay. What does that
matter?"

*' Why, the rick was worth forty pounds,"
said Cherry.

*'I do not care for forty pounds. I care
that I shall be obeyed," said Alvar.

A great deal more discussion followed,
chiefly between Alvar and Jack; the latter
at last relieving his mind of much of the
good advice which he had long been burning
to bestow. He showed Alvar his errors at
length, and in the clearest language. Alvar

took it very coolly, and without much more
interest than if it had been an essay. He
was not, as they would have expected, enraged
at the burnt rick ; indeed Cheriton
could not help fancying that he regarded it
as a justification of his violence towards
Chris. As usual, it was the sense of
Cheriton' s opposing view rather than the
thing itself that annoyed him.

' Don't worry yourself. Cherry," said
Jack, as he wished him good-night. *i'll go
the first thing in the morning and find out
the rights of it."

Accordingly, before either of his brothers
appeared. Jack started off through wind and
rain, and investigated the story of the burnt
rick.

He returned in high feather, and found
them still at breakfast ; for Alvar by no
means held his father's opinion as to the
merits of early rising.

' Well," said Jack, 'rit's clear that Chris

had nothing to do with it. He left home at

half-past four, went straight to old Bill's

cottage, where Alice Fisher gave him some

p 2

tea, and where no doubt they indulged in a
good crack, left them at half-past five, and
came straight up here with the note for
Alvar, when you saw him."

'eyes," said Cherry, ''I looked at the
clock when I came over to the fire."

*' Well, then, John Kitson saw the rick
on fire exactly at half-past five, he heard
the church clock strike ; so if you and Alvar
go over to Hazelbyby tomorrow, and prove
that Chris came here on his way from old
Bill's at that time, you can set it all to
rights in a moment. And if that idiot
Fletcher had sent for you for Alvar  last
night, poor Chris would never have been
suspected."

'well, Jack, you have done a good
morning's work," said Cherry, much
relieved.

"Yes. Give me some coffee, I had
hardly any breakfast," said Jack, cutting
himself some cold beef. It is such a cold
morning, too."

*' And who did set the rick on fire, then?"
said Cherry.

** All, that's not so clear. Fletcher and
Jos Green had a shindy a day or two ago,
and that lad is " capable of anything ; but,
after all, it may have been an accident."

Alvar all this time had eaten his breakfast
in silence. He did not disbelieve Jack's
evidence, but perhaps he hardly felt its force,
and the sense of having been nearly concerned
in committing an injustice, did not
strike him as forcibly as it did the others.
He felt, perhaps not unnaturally, a sense of
intense irritation again the whole Fleming
family, and a wish never to hear their names
again. Besides, Jack was openly triumphant,
and he could not doubt that Cherry was
secretly so.

The conversation dropped therefore, and
Alvar, as the weather brightened, ordered
his horse and went out. Jack retreated to
his books ; and presently came the vicar, to
hear the rights of the story about Chris
Fleming.

Cheriton said as little as he could, declaring
that the arrest had been an entire
mistake, which they much regretted, and

that Alvar would take care that it was set
right tomorrow.

'shave you heard of the outbreak of
reforming zeal at Elderthwaite ? " asked
Mr. Ellesmere.

' Yes," said Cheriton, colouring. 'miss
Seyton told me about it, and besides,
Clements was full of it when I saw him last.
You see some new blood has come into the
place, and there is a violent reaction, of
course only among the few."

"Yes. Clements came to consult me
about writing to the bishop. They want to
have a curate; but I am afraid the old
parson has set all his strength against it,
and there are plenty to back him up.
Besides, I don't see how the payment could
be managed, as, of course. Miss Seyton will
not act against her uncle. I told Clements
to have patience; but a good deal of ill-feeling
is cropping up. I wish you would
go over and see if you can smooth things
down a little."

* Do you think I could? "

"Why, yes; you always take Elderthwaite

abuses under your protection. You would
be the only curate to please the parson and
his parishioners, too ! "

Mr. Ellesmere spoke entirely in jest, and
was exceedingly surprised when Cheriton
answered seriously, 

' Indeed, I have thought so;" and then
proceeded, at greater length than he had
done with Jack, to unfold his project. He
did not try to prepossess the vicar in its
favour, nor touch on his home difficulties,
save by saying that an idle life at Oakby
would not suit him. He said plainly that
he felt that only the peculiar circumstances
of Elderthwaite, and his own independent
means, could justify such a step in one who
believed himself likely to have but little time
and less strength before him. Would Mr.
Ellesmere explain the whole state of the
case to the bishop, and ask  other matters
being satisfactory  would he ordain him if
the next spring he found himself capable
of doing anything.

** And would this really content you,
Cherry?" said Mr. Ellesmere. '* It would

be clerical work in its most unattractive
form, among, I should say, very unattractive
people ? ''

*not to me," said Cheriton. *sit would
not be a distasteful life to me."

** And then the climate here  "

' That the doctors shall decide next
spring," said Cherry, smiling.

*' I don't see my way to it, my boy," said
Mr. Ellesmere, struck by his fragile look.
*you must not run risks, and you would
take responsibilities upon you which would
make each particular risk seem unavoidable."

Cheriton evidently did not see his way to
a reply. His face fell. The vivid, vigorous
nature, checked at every turn, was ever
striving after a fresh outlet. The instinct ta
be up and doing, to put his hand to everything
that came to it, could not be stifled by
loss and disappointment, or even by want of
physical health and strength. After a pause
he said, in an altered voice, 

** There are things that make it seem as
if that did not much matter. I mean it is
my own concern noir. A short life and a

busy one is better than a few more months,
or years even, Hke mine."

** I do not think your life has ever been
useless yet. Cherry, even under the imitations
that have been laid on it," said Mr.
Ellesmere, quietly.

Cheriton sat looking into the fire in
silence, then he turned round and smiled
with much of his old playful defiance, though
there was a deeper undercurrent.
- * You can keep a look-out on me all the
winter, and tell the Elderthwaite reformers
that they don't know what may happen, if
they will only have patience. Then next
spring I'll come and ask your advice again,
and if you make out a very good case against
me, why, Til give in.

He uttered the last words slowly, and Mr.
Ellesmere fully understood all that they
implied. He feared that the question might
be answered for him before next spring.

Cherry himself felt that he had not taken
a very favourable moment for putting forward
his designs, for he was neither looking nor
feeling well ; and could hardly point to liin;i-

self as a proof of the suitability of his native
climate. Still the communication had given
a certain point to look forward to, and was
an individual interest apart from theconfusing
worry of affairs at Oakby. If, after the
present crisis had subsided, Alvar still held
to his intention of going to the sea with him,
their old friendliness would soon supersede
the present irritation. Then, afterwards, he
would go to London, break up his arrangements
there, and see the Stanforths, and
would then spend Christmas with his grandmother.
In the meantime he would be
exceedingly prudent; and having regard
both to the bad weather and to the charge
of interference, would leave Alvar to go by
himself to Hazelbyby tomorrow.

Alvar' s ride had been interrupted by an
encounter with Edward Fleming, full of
resentment, by no means unnatural, though
it was by this time somewhat unreasonable,
for he could hardly help believing that the
accusation against Chris had been intentional.
A very sturdy and recalcitrant north countryman
he showed himself, respectful indeed

in word to the squire, but intensely conscious
of his injuries, and giving the squire very
plainly to understand that a full explanation
before all the magistrates at Hazelbyby, not to
say a full apology, was no more than his
duty, and fully to be expected of him. It
was an unfortunate meeting. An appeal to
Alvar's generosity and protection would have
been instantly responded to ; but the one
form of pride roused the other, and stirred
up the fear of dictation in his mind. He
looked down at the sullen, resolute face of
the young farmer with an expression of
intense haughtiness, a look which, on the
dark foreign face, seemed utterly hateful to
Fleming, and said, as he made his horse
move on, 

' That is as I shall please."

** If you let my brother be wronged, sir,"
said Fleming, *' mark me, you'll repent it.
'Tis not the way your father would treat an
old tenant, nor your brother either. A dog
had his rights at their hands."

And in a rage, intensified by his consciousness
of Alvar's scorn, he flung ofi" with a

sense of injury which would have led an
Irishman to fire a shot, but which, in the
English farmer, meant opposing the squire
in Church and State, disobliging him on
every private and parochial question, taking
on every occasion the other side, and carrying
on this line of conduct till his dying day.

He was young, too, and, as he had
remarked to Cheriton, had education, and
he might confide his grievance to the county
paper. But he was both too proud and too
generous to appeal again to Cheriton ; and,
besides, he never supposed for a moment
that the squire would vrilhhold his evidence.

But Alvar's wrath was hot within him.
As master against servant, as head of the
family against his juniors, above all, as
gentleman against peasant, he felt bound to
assert himself and his authority. No one
should threaten him into begging off the
boy who had insulted him, and whose family
had so defied him. He would not yield to
any one's view of his duty. Let the insolent
boy have a few weeks more of suspense ;
what did it matter. ? When the real trial

came he would condescend to give evidence
in bis favour (subpoenas did not at that
moment occur to his mind), and would
explain to the judge why he had chosen to
delay his evidence. Then every one would
see with what vigour he could administer his
estate ; and perhaps he would, to please
Cheriton, then of his own free will confer
some benefit on the Flemings which would
make everything smooth.

Of course Alvar was not so foolish as his
intentions, but all his past negligence had
resulted in an amount of present ignorance
of his surroundings which made such a
scheme appear possible to him. It did strike
him that Cheriton might take the matter
into his own hands, and go to Hazelbyby himself;
but so great a point had been made of
his own going that he hardly knew how far
this would supersede the need for it, and he
did not mean to provoke a discussion.

Circumstances favoured him ; Jack was
going to dine and sleep at Ashrigg, he
himself had another dinner engagement, and
on the next day he had really promised to go

early and shoot with Lord Milford. Cheriton
had forgotten all about this, and, anxious
not to irritate Alvar, said nothing about the
magistrates' meeting during the short time
they were together.

CHAPTER XLIV.

A NEW LIFE.

His peaceful being slowly passes by
To some more perfect peace."

The next morning Cheriton slept late,
and awoke to the consciousness that he had
caught a slight cold, ** which," as he said to
himself, * might happen to any one."

* Will you ask Mr. Lester to come to me
before he goes to Hazelbyby ? " he said, not
feeling quite able to satisfy himself that
Alvar had all the needful evidence clear in
his head.

'*Mr. Lester is not going to Hazelbyby,
sir," said the man; *'he went to Lord
Milford's early this morning in the dog-cart.
He left word that he would not disturb you,
sir."

The engagement at-Milford flashed across
Cheriton's mind, and with dismay and
indignation he perceived that Alvar had
not thought it worth while to break it on
Chris Fleming's account. In a moment he
recognized the utter ruin that would fall on
all chance of Alvar's success with his tenants,
still more the disgrace that he would bring
on himself in the eyes of the whole bench of
magistrates, by the neglect of such an obvious
duty, while on his own part he felt that if
was such an unkindness as he hardly knew
how to forgive. His first impulse was to let
the matter alone, and to leave Alvar to bear
the brunt of his own misdoings. But then
the thought came of the distress to the
Flemings, of the fatal injury to the boy from
the weeks of undeserved detention, and,
after all, the discredit would fall on them all
alike. He forgot all his intention of nursing
his cold, forgot its very existence, as he
perceived, on looking at his watch, that he
had barely time to reach Hazelbyby for the
meeting.

** It is all the same," he said, **my going

to Hazelbyby will answer every purpose. Tell
them to bring Molly round at once. As
Mr. Lester has the dog-cart, I will ride."

'* There is a very cold wind, and it looks
like rain, sir."

That can't be helped," said Cheriton,
' there is no time to lose."

He tried to make his expedition seem a
matter of course ; but every one in the house
believed that he went because the squire had
gone off on his own pleasure, or out of what the
old cook did not hesitate to call "nasty spite,"
had refused to justify little Fleming. Indeed,
as Cheriton rode hurriedly away, he could
hardly divest himself of the same opinion.

In the meanwhile, Alvar no sooner found
himself well on the way to Milford than he
began to feel pangs of compunction. The
cold wind and drizzling rain beat in his face,
as the conviction was borne in upon him, that
Cheriton would certainly go to Hazelbyby in
his place. He had not been at Milford since
the day of the great rejoicing, when Cheriton,
with all his fresh honours, had met them
there, had wooed, and, as he thought, won

VOL. HI. Q

Kuth Soyton ; when he himself was yh-ginia's
acknowledged lover. He called her to mind,
as she had walked by his side in smiling
content, as she played with the children 
felt noir, as he never had then, the wistfulness
of her eyes when they met his, and almost
for the first time he recognized that the want
of devotion had been on his side. He had
not loved her enough. A sense of discouragement
and despondence seized on him, a deep
melancholy softened the resentment which"
he had been cherishing. As he looked back
on the years of his father's neglect, on
Virginia's dismissal, on his brother's views
of what his position required, for once the
sense of his shortcomings overpowered his
sense of the many excuses for them. His
indifference to the chance of Cheriton's
running a great risk touched him with a
self-reproach for which his theories of life
offered no palliative. He could not rest,
and with a suddenness and vehemence of
action most unusual with him, he turned to
Lord Milford as they prepared to start on
their day's sport, declared that he had

sullenly recollected an important engagement,
and must beg them to excuse lira at
once ; overruled all objections on the score
of his horse wanting rest by declaring that
he would only drive to the station, and go by
train to Hazelbyby.

' I am humiliated by my want of courtesy
to your lordship, but it is necessary that I
should go," he said; but what with the
delay of starting, and the absence of a train
at the last moment, the magistrates' meeting
was over long before he reached Hazelbyby,
every one had dispersed, and the court-house
was shut.

He could not bring himself to ask any
questions; but ordered a conveyance and
started on his way back to Oakby, hardly
knowing whether to reveal his change of
purpose or not. On the road he passed the
three Fleming brothers, trudging home
through the mud. The looked away, and
omitted to touch their hats to him. Alvar
said to himself that he did not care ; bat
the sense of unpopularity can never be other
than bitter. He thought to himself that
Q 2

after all English gentlemen did not always
live on their estates. There were hundreds
of his father's rank who did not hold his
father's view of their duties. He could shut
Oakby up, let it, go where he would never
see it again. But where ? Steer as the
disinherited heir would he set foot in Seville,
and he had no craving to hunt tigers in
India, or buffaloes on the prairies. He did
not wish to go yachting ; did not care to.
travel ; he hated the fogs and the colourless-ness
of London. He was as little ready to
cut himself loose from all his moorings as
Cheriton himself. Suddenly, as he drove on,
he saw one of the Oakby grooms riding fast
towards him. The man pulled up as he
passed.

'* Mr. Cheriton is ill, sir; Mrs. Lester is
there, and she sent me for the doctor."

Alvar felt as if he had been shot.

'' Side on," he said, breathlessly; then
seized the driver of the trap by the shoulder
' Drive fast; I will give you five pounds
if you will drive fast. My brother is ill ; he
will want me."

Aj, sir  all right, sir," said the lad,
lashing up his horse.

Alvar felt as if a telegraph would have
been slow; but he folded his arms, and sat
like a statue till they reached the door,
when he sprang out, and at the foot of the
stairs saw Jack.

Alvar ! you here ! " he exclaimed.

'' What is it ?  where is he ?  wdiat has
happened ?  tell me ! " cried Alvar.

'cherry went to Hazelbyby, of course, tc
clear Chris, as you were out of the way.
He was so done up when he came back, and
seems so evidently in for just such a bad
attack as he had before, that granny, who
came back here with me, sent for Mr. Adamson.
Yes, he is in bed ; he was we
through."

Jack's face was like thunder ; but Alvar
dashed past him upstairs, and opened the
door of his brother's room.

Cheriton was sitting? up in bed. He had
recovered a little from the exhaustion of his
hasty ride, and though suffering much pain
and oppression, was spending some of the

little breath he had left, in trying to.
explain matters to his grandmother.

'you always were a perverse lad, or you
would not be using your voice now, Cherry''
she said. '' When your brother comes
back, I shall give him a piece of my
mind."

'' There he is," cried Cherry. There was
a look in his eyes for a moment as if he
hardly knew how they were to meet ; but as
Alvar advanced into the room, all his
vehemence subsided. He came up to the
bed, and laid his hand on Cheriton's with
the old tender touch.

"You are ill, mi caro. I think you must
not talk so much just now."

Cheriton looked up in his face, and read
in it, steady as was the voice, an altogether
new terror and trouble.

'' This is my own fault," he said. "I was
in such a hurry  that  I would not wait for
the carriage. After all, there would have
been time."

"Oh, my brother  my brother!" cried
Alvar, losing his self-control, "your fault!

Grandmother, it is I who have let him kill
himself."

"You are just crazy," said Mrs. Lester,
agitated and angry, as Alvar rushed up to
her, and threw himself on his knees beside
her chair, clasping her hands in his. " I
don't care whose fault it is. No doubt you
are one as bad as the other. For the last
half hour I have been trying to make Cherry
hold his tongue, and now you make a worse
turmoil than ever. Since my poor son went
there is no one to look to."

Mrs. Lester was shaken and terrified by
the shock of sudden alarm, and agitated by
Alvar' s extraordinary behaviour, and thus
her still fresh grief came back on her, and
she burst into tears.

Oh, granny, don't  don't ! " cried
Cherry, and the distress of his tone recalled
Alvar to his senses.

Oh, I am a fool ! " he said, and getting
up, he applied himself to soothe his grandmother
with all the tact of which he was
master, and was so successful, that in a few
minutes she went away in search of some

remedy for Cheriton, who, as he was left
alone with his brother, felt, spite of his
increasing suffering, the old sense of repose
in Alvar's care creep over him.

*ras violent an attack as the last, and
much less strength to meet it," was the
doctor's verdict, and the great common
terror hushed for the time all disputes and
differences.

Mrs. Lester remained at Oakby, Nettie
had returned to London a few days previously,
and both she and Bob held
themselves ready for a sudden summons.

Mrs. Lester questioned Alvar on that first
evening about all that had passed, in a dry,
caustic fashion, while he answered, meekly
enough. 'why, ye '11 have made yourself
a laughing-stock to the whole place," was
her only comment on the story of the horsewhipping.


Alvar coloured to his temples, but said
nothing; the reproach of Jack's silent misery
was much harder to bear. He who knew
how all the last weeks had been troubled by
Alvar's fault, could not forgive, and felt that

if Cheriton died, he could never bear the
sight of Alvar again.

Alvar himself was shaken and disturbed
as he had never been before. He had lost
all the calm hopefulness and power of living
in the present, that had made him such a
support in Cheriton 's previous illness ; and
though he was still a devoted and efficient
nurse to him, there were times when he was
quite unable to control his distress. He was
frightened, and expected the worst ; and
poor Jack had to try to encourage him, a
process that much softened his indignation.

All this was fully apparent to Cheriton.
There was no longer the daze and confusion
of that first attack of illness, the boyish
astonishment at the fact of being ill at all,
the novelty of all the surroundings, now, alas!
so familiar ; no longer, too, the sense that
the exceeding sweetness of life made death
incredible ; no longer the same instinctive
dependence on those around. Since then
Cheriton had travelled a long way on the
road of life, had looked across the dark
river, and grown familiar with the thought

of its other shore ; he was no longer
frightened at his own suffering, or at its
probable result, and, as his senses were
generally clear, except sometimes at night,
or when under the influence of the remedies,
he was able to think for others  a habit in
which he had gained considerable skill.

He made Alvar write to Mr. Stanford,
and beg that Gipsy might write to Jack,
knowing that the surprise and joy of such a
letter, and the relief of pouring out his heart
in the answer, must lighten the heavy weight
of the poor boy's anxiety ; and so, in truth,
it did, though Jack could never trust himself
to thank Cherry for his kind thought. He
also made the vicar go to Edward Fleming,
and tell him that Alvar had only been a few
minutes too late in coming to give evidence,
and to entreat him to lay aside any ill-feeling
for the misunderstanding 'which," he said,
"was partly caused by my bad management."
He thought much about the state
of affairs at Elderthwaite, or rather, perhaps,
recalled at intervals much previous thinking.
He was not equal to anything like a connected

conversation, and be knew that no
one would let the poor vehement old parson
come near him ; but he greatly astonished
his grandmother by telling  her that he had
an especial desire to see Virginia Seyton.

'' I cannot talk enough to tell you
why," he said; "but, granny, do get her to
come''

Mrs. Lester promised; for how could
she refuse him ? He gave a good many
directions to Mr. Ellesmere, and in especial
desired that a certain cup, won many years
ago at some county athletic sports in a
contest with his cousin Eupert, should be
given to him as a remembrance.

From only one thing Cheriton's whole
heart shrank, and that was from forcing Jack
to listen to parting words. He had several
things to say to him, but he put them off;
he could not bear the sight of Jack's grief,
and in this case could not trust his own self-command.
It was the one parting that' he
could not yet face.

With Alvar it was different. In one way,
he had with him much less sense of self-restraint,

and in another, things lay between
them that must be cleared away.

This state of things lasted for several days,
and all the while the hard struggle between
the remedies and the disease went on, a hand-to-hand
fight indeed, and Cheriton's strength
ebbed away, till he knew that he dared wait
no longer for what he wanted to say.

It had been raining, but the yellow, level
light of an October evening was shining
through the thinly-clothed boughs of the
great elms, and lighting up the russet and
amber of the woodlands ; while the purple
hills beyond were still heavy with clouds 
clouds receding more and more as the clear
blue spread over the sky.

As Cheriton listened to the noise of the
rooks, and looked out at the sunset, he
recalled the awe and strange curiosity, the
clinging to the dear home, to the dearer
love which had made life so dear ; the
attempted submission, the dim trust that
death, if it came, must be well for him, with
which he had first said to himself that he
must die; remembered, too, other hours,

when, in weakness of body and anguish of
soul, he had found it still harder to believe
that it must be well for him that he should
live. The passionate joy, the passionate
sorrow, had passed away, or rather, had
been offered at last as a willing sacrifice,
and the loving kindly spirit had found
sweetness in life without the first, while
much anxiety, much trying disappointment,
had succeeded to the second. Now there
came over him a wonderful peace, as he
summoned his strength for what he had in
his mind to say.

With a look and sign he called Alvar
over to him; and Jack, who was sitting
apart in the window, watched and listened.

*' Alvar," he said, taking hold of his hand,
*'I see it clearly." And the intent, wide-open
eyes, seemed to Jack as if they could
indeed look beyond the mists of life. " We
were wrong to wish you like ourselves.
Forgive me. You  yourself  can be as
good for Oakby as  I  yes  as my father.
But there is only one way for us both  to
love God with all our hearts, and our

neighbour as ourself. To take pains about
it for His sake. That is the truth, Alvar 
the truth as I know it ! "

''Ah! " cried Alvar, "but I do not love
my neighbours ! that is the difference. But
I love you, oh ! my brother  my brother !
Is it religion that will make me what you
wish ? I will be religious ; I will no longer
be careless ; but oh, caw  caro mio ! if I
lose you, I have no heart to change. I have
grieved you. Oh ! what punishment is therefor
me ? I would do penance like Manoel.
What can I do?"

Alvar flung himself on his knees, the tears
started in his eyes and choked his voice.
At last he was stirred to the depths, and
instincts deeper than teaching or training
came to the surface.

*you know Who bore our sins for us,"
said Cheriton, '' because He loved us."

How much, or how little, Alvar knew,
after his formal teaching, and careless, unmoved
youth, would be hard to say; probably
Cheriton could not conceive how little ; but
face, voice, and manner had moved Alvar 's

soul to a great conviction, however little he
realized what Cheriton had meant to say.

He called on that name which his brothers
had never heard from his lips before, save in
some careless foreign oath.

I swear," he said  " I swear that I will
be a religious man, and that I will be a good
squire to Oakby. I make it a vow if my
brother recovers  "

Oh, hush  hush ! " interposed Cheriton.
' If not  we shall meet again  and you
must be good to Oakby. Let me know you
will ! "

*' I will ! I will ! " cried Alvar, completely
carried away. He would have thrown his
arms round Cheriton, but Jack interposed 

'* Alvar ! Alvar ! this is enough. He
must not have this agitation. Alvar yielded,
but, too much overcome to control himself,
rushed out of the room.

As he hurried blindly down the stairs he
met Mr. Ellesmere, and with a sudden
impulse caught hold of his hand.

Mr. Ellesmere, you are a priest. I
have sworn to him that I will change, that I

will be religious. I give myself up to you.
I will do whatever you wish. I swear to
obey you  "

* Gently, gently!" said the astonished
vicar. ** You are too much agitated to
know what you say. Come with me into the
study ; tell me what has passed. Believe
me that I desire to help you in this great
sorrow."

Alvar followed him, and as Mr. Ellesmere
talked and listened to him, he began to hope
that, in spite of an ignorance which he had
hitherto had neither the conscientious desire
nor the intellectual curiosity to diminish, in
spite .of blind impulses rashly followed, the
will for good that must bring a blessing had
at last been awakened, even in this strange
longing for vow and penance, an instinct
that seemed inherited without the faith from
which it had sprung. Alvar was in the mood
which might have made his Spanish ancestors
vow all their worldly goods away and think
to buy a blessing, and to listen to him without
unduly checking his vehemence, and yet to
lead his thoughts upward, was a hard task ;

since Alvar was left subdued and quieted,
and yet with an inkling of what had been
really wrong with him, it may be inferred
that Mr. Ellesmere succeeded better than he
had hoped to do.

Meanwhile, to poor Jack, every word of
Cheriton's had thrilled with a thousand
meanings. He knew that silence was
imperative, and did not mean to say another
word ; but Cherry felt his hand tremble ashe
gave him some water, and looked up at
him with a smile.

'you will have Gipsy soon," he whispered,
my own dear boy."

Jack pressed his hand. " To take pains
for His sake." With his whole heart Jack
recognized this key-note. Nothing else
would do. Even Gipsy could not by herself
give his life the full joy of a sufficient purpose
; but as he thought of all the currents
through which he must steer, and knew too
well which way they often set, he shuddered.

If I had not you to talk everything outwith
! " he said, inadequately enough.

Oh, Jack, if I can't help you still, it
VOL. in. E

vill be because the work is done better. I
don't fancy now that everything hangs on me.
I am content."

And Jack felt that the memory of that
perfect contentment could never pass away
from him.

CHAPTER XLV.

MY LADY AND MY QUEEN.

Let all be well be well."

*' So, Queenie, you see there will soon be an
end of it all ! "

The speaker was Miss Seyton. She
stood looking down at her niece with an
odd quiver in lip and voice, even while her
tone was not altogether a sad one. Virginia
sat in dismayed silence ; she had been
arranging a bunch of autumn leaves and
berries to brighten up the dark old drawing-room,
which bore many a trace of her
presence in bits of needlework and tokens
of pleasant occupation, though the house
was duller and quieter than ever now that
Mr. Seyton' s rapidly failing health gave
R 2

him the habits of an invalid, and that both
the boys were absent. Miss Seyton looked
more faded than ever, but she was kind
and friendly with Virginia, even though
she could not divest her voice of its
sarcastic tone as she continued, 

"You are a person of consequence, and
you ought to understand the state of the
case."

That Roland means to sell Elder-thwart
? " said Virginia, slowly.

'' Yes. We can't afford, Virginia, to
make pretences to each other, and we
know that it will come before many months.
Then what are we to do ? "

However much it went against Virginia
to discuss the results of her father's death,
she felt that there was some truth in her
aunt's words, that they ought to be prepared
for so great a change ; and she had
also learnt to practise great directness in
dealing with Miss Seyton.

I have sometimes supposed that you
would live at the vicarage, Aunt Julia,"
she said.

*' Not if I have a penny to live on elsewhere,"
replied Miss Seyton. '' James
and I were never friends, and I'll not seethe
place in the hands of strangers.
Besides, I've had a thirty years' imprisonment,
and I'd like my freedom. Look
here  when I was a girl I was just like the
others; I loved pleasure as well as they
did, and had it too. I was as daring as
ever a Seyton of them all. However, I
meant to marry and live in the south, and
I was quite good enough, my dear, for the
man I was engaged to. Then he quarrelled
v/ith James, and that began the breach.
I didn't marry, as you may see, and when
Qiiy father died my portion couldn't be paid
off without a sale, and things were in such
a mess I had no power to claim it. So
here I stayed, and, let me tell you, I've
stopped up a good many holes, and been
quite as great a blessing to my family as
they deserved."

Virginia laughed in spite of herself,
though her answer was grave.

Yes, I know that, now."

*' But now, d'ye see, Yirginia, I'm tired
of it. I'm only fifty, and it'll go hard if I
don't get some pickings out of the sale
of the estate. Do you know, we have
some old cousins living in Bath, a Euth
and Virginia of another generation ? I'm
inclined to think I should like to go into
society  to ' come out,' in fact, in a smart
cap, and to live within reach of a circulating
library and scandal. That's my view, and
that's what I mean to aim at when the
time comes. What do you say ? "

*' I should like the boys to have a home
somehow," said Virginia. " Perhaps that
would make some place into home forme."


I don't wish to desert you," said Miss
Seyton, '' but candidly I think we should be
happier apart. We shouldn't amuse each
other if we lived together. But won't
James want to keep you ? "

'' 1 don't know," said Virginia. " I am
afraid it would not be a good plan for the
boys to go there for holidays  if this place
is to be given up. But oh. Aunt Julia,

low can we tell what will happen ? I can't
make plans ; I don't feel as if it mattered ;
and Roland seems to want to cast us all
off."

*' Yes ; he's a selfish fellow. But, my
dear, just consider how much worse it
would be, if we had to take him on. Thank
your stars that he means to stay in India.
And as for the place, with its paint and its
fences and its broken glass, let it go. We're
better free of it. He is right there. The
worst part of the story is poor old James
who must stay."

He can't forgive Poland."

No  you see,Queenie, it's wits that telL
James hasn't brains, and he has never
thought of cutting himself loose. He
couldn't live away from Elderthwaite, anymore
than he could live without his skin.
But when he hasn't the family dignity
to keep him up, I'm afraid he'll go
down."

He is so wretched now about Cheriton
Lester."

Yes. He is the only Lester worth

fretting for. As for that prig Jack, I'd
like to see him make a fool of himself. I'd
like to see him ' exceed his allowance
considerably.' There's a pretty way of
putting it for you ! "

With which parting shot Miss Seyton
went away, and Virginia sat sorrowful and
perplexed, and with something of the family
bitterness in her heart. Life was very
hard to her. Her love for each one of her
relations was a triumph over difficulties,
and the sweet spontaneous passion that
had promised to make her happy had been
in its turn triumphed over by the uncongeniality
of her lover. The softness of
early youth and of her previous training
had been replaced by something of the
strength that expects little and makes the
best of a bad business, but at a risk, the
risk of the sense that evil is inevitable.
Virginia was always outwardly gentle ; but
she had been thrown back on herself till
she had gained a self-reliance that the
Seyton blood in her was ready to exaggerate
into scorn. For even Ruth was slow in

answering lier letters, and never wrote as
in her girlish days.

As she sat musing a note was brought to
her. It was from Mrs. Lester, containing
Cheriton's imperative request that she
would come and see him. Would she come
at once ?

Virginia's cheeks flamed as if the missive
had been from Alvar himself. She got up
and put the note in her pocket, dressed
herself, and leaving word with one of the
servants that she meant to take a walk, set
forth without delay for Oakby, walking
through the plantations, across the fell, and
through the fir wood, as she had scarcely
ever done alone before. She remembered
going as Alvar' s betrothed to ask for
Cheriton during his first illness, and Alvar's
absorption and indifference to her presence.
Now that would be natural enough. Still
she could scarcely think of Cheriton in her
dread and wonder as to who might greet
her, as she rang at the bell, and asked for
Mrs. Lester, who came forward into the
hall to receive her.

"My dear," lie said, ''I do not know what
Clierry wants with you ; but we can't refuse
him. Will you come at once ? "

Virginia was afraid to ask questions, she
followed the old lady's slow progress up the
dusky staircase, and into Cheriton's room.

The daylight was now fast fading, but
its last rays fell on Cheriton's wide-opened
eyes and flushed face.

He took hold of her hand, and said with
extreme difficulty, 

' Thank you  my love to the parson.
Ask Jack what I meant to do  and then
tell him. Tell him  I say  he must reform
Elderthwaite for my sake. He must do it
himself. I know he can. Don't let him he
one of the abuses. Don't get into despair."
He paused for breath, and then with an
accent and smile that through all the
suffering had something of his old playful
daring, ' I mustn't say anything else to you,
but that will come right too."

*'I will tell him," faltered Virginia, awed,
bewildered, and yet with a strange sense of
encouragement ; she let herself be drawn

away, heard Mrs. Lester say that it was too
dark for her to go home alone, she should
send Jack with her to get a breath of air,
while Cherry was "suffering less. He was
so fully himself it was hard to believe in
the danger, but the attacks of coughing
were most exhausting, and he could hardly
take anything, she was very hopeless, and
my grandson ''  this always meant Alvar
thought badly of him. " Come in here,
my dear, and I will fetch Jack."

As Mrs Lester put her into the library,
and left her there alone in the dusk, the
tears that she had hitherto restrained broke
forth.

She thought that she was crying for
Cheriton, but all her own sad future, all
her yearnings for the lost past, mingled
together, and she wept the more because,
she knew not how, Cheriton had given hera
sort of indefinite comfort.

She did not hear the study door open,
nor see Alvar come through the room, nor
did he see her in the dim light, till he
hoard her sobbing.

Who is it ? " he exclaimed, becoming
aware of a woman's figure near the fire.
She started up, and with her first movement
he knew her. " Mi dona / " he cried
in his astonishment.

Cherry asked to see me," she faltered.
He is so ill  I could not help crying."

Ah, no ! " said Alvar ; and I may not
comfort you ! "

But he came close and stood by her'
side, and she saw that he too was greatly
agitated. She wanted to speak about
Cheriton, but she could not command her
voice, nor think of a word to say.

Suddenly Alvar turned and clasped her
hand.

'' Ah ! " he cried, with such vehemence
as she had never seen in him before. " My
heart is breaking ! Can you never forgive ?
I love you : I have always loved you.
When you sent me from you, it was my
pride that let me submit ! In my own
country I knew that for your sake I was
English  English altogether. I am not
worthy, but I repent. I have confessed.

Help me, and I will be a good Englishman
! For I have now no other country,
and I cannot live without you. Give me
your hand once more ! "

Alvar poured forth this torrent with
such burning eagerness, such abandonment
of entreaty, that he did not see how weak
were the defences he was attacking.

*' Indeed," she whispered, " it was not
that  not that I thought you were  not
good  I thought you did not love me 
much."

'* I did  I do love you  I love you as
my life ! But you ? "

I have always loved you. I could not
change," she said, with something of her
old gentle dignity. " But  I have been
very unhappy all this time."

Ah, now you shall be happy ! Yet,
what do I say ? How can I make any one
happy ! I who have grieved and vexed
my brother with my unkindness  nay,
caused his illness even  I cannot make
you happy ! " said Alvar, in a tone of real
self-blame.

'' I think you can ! " said Virginia softly ;
but the words bad hardly passed her lips
when she started away from him, as Jack
came into the room.

Granny says I am to walk home with
you, Virginia. What, Alvar, are you
here? they have been looking for you.
Do go to Cherry  she is so restless now ! "

'' I will go," said Alvar. *' Take care
of her, Jack, for I must not come. Farewell,
mi regna I " He took both her hands
and kissed them, then put her towards
Jack, and hurried away ; while poor
Virginia glanced in much confusion at her
escort ; but he was too much absorbed in
grief and anxiety to take in what had
passed, or to heed it if he did. He walked
on by her side without speaking ; till she,
trying to collect her thoughts, and actuated
by a very unnecessary fear of what he
would think of her silence, bethought
herself to ask him what Cheriton wished
her to tell her uncle.

'' He said I was to ask you ? "

He wanted to take orders, and be

curate of Eldertliwaite,'* said Jack. '' You
know London did not suit him, and the
work was too hard, and life at home was
so worrying for him. Besides, he hated
being idle. He thought that he could
manage to get things right at Elder-thwart,
and he said that he should like
it, and be happy there."

Jack spoke in a dull, heavy voice, his
use of the past tense marking how completely
he regarded the possibilities of
which he spoke as at an end ; and something
in the tone showing that the proposal
had been distasteful to him.

Would Cherry have given himself for
that ? " exclaimed Virginia.

"Yes," said Jack. ''I didn't like it.
It seemed a great sacrifice, and besides 
he was not half strong enough."

'but did he care so much? I don't
mean that I can't understand his wishing
to take orders  but just for Elderthwaite ! "

He is very fond of Elderthwaite. And
he said that it was only because he fancied
that he could be more useful there than

any one else ; and because lie lias money,
that lie was justified in proposing it  
because lie was ill, I mean."

Indeed, lie could do good there ! He
always did ! "

You know," said Jack, rather more
freely, 'that Cherry has a notion that
when a person seems specially marked out
for any situation, he is likely, in the long
run, to be the best person for it. He says
you can't destroy evil without good. That
people sit their own places, and so he
believes that Elderthwaite would do better,
in the long run, if Parson Seyton could be
encouraged to make things a little more
ship-shape, than it would with a new manif
he were driven away. You see he gets
fond of people. I don't see it ; I think
it's fanciful. All reformers begin with a
clean sweep. Then Cherry said valuables
were sometimes found in the dust; nobody
would reform if you ran at them with a
besom. Of course he could persuade
people ; at any rate, he always thought he
could."

** He thinks the sun is more powerful than
the north wind," said Virginia. ' I am sure
Uncle James would have given in to him'*

'' So he said. But he was mistaken in
one case, and then he blamed himself, and
I suppose  I suppose  he has conquered
at last ! Any way, Virginia, you were to
tell your uncle what he wished to do."

I will tell him. He is breaking his
heart about Cherry now."

'' I suppose so. I can't come in. Goodbye;
we'll send over in the morning."

Jack turned awa3\ Cheriton's kindly
theories might seem fanciful to him ; but
he would never have the chance of knocking
them on the head any more. He was
so miserable that even the thought of
Gripsy only made him feel her absence, and
wonder if so bright a creature could continue
to care for him, when he had grown
into a stern, hard-hearted person, without
any power of softening. Poor Jack's hard
heart was Yere heavy, and beat so fast ashe
came up to the house, that he could
hardly ask if there was any change.

VOL. III. s

CHAPTER XLVI.

MY DEA !

* But still be a woman to you."

Early the next morning Virginia received
a letter from Alvar, written at intervals
during his night watch in Cheriton's room.
Perhaps it was the first real communication
she had ever received from him, and in it
he made a sort of confession of his shortcomings,
as far as he himself understood
them. He told her that he had been
'' revengeful " towards his father, and that
in the affair of the Flemings he had
allowed '' the passion of jealousy'* to overcome
him. He recounted his promise to
Cheriton, and with the simplicity that was
at once so strange and so engaging a part
of his character, assured her 'that he was

no longer indifferent to religion," but would
follow the instructions of Mr. Ellesmere.
'' I think," he added, '' that this will give
you pleasure."

There was a great deal about Cheriton,
Alvar declaring that he could not now
despair of anything, but that he should have
written to her at such a time, and about
himself, was enough to mark the change
in his former relations with Virginia.

The change in himself she was ready to
take for granted. All must be right where
there was such humility and power of
repentance ; and perhaps she did him more
justice than even Cheriton could have
done. For Alvar had undergone no
change of intellectual conviction, that
element was wanting, both in his former
carelessness, and in his present acceptance
of a new obligation, and in the excitement
of feeling under which he was acting love
and remorse towards his brother had the
largest share. But he had recognized
himself as erring, and intended to amend,
and such a resolution must bring a blessing.

But as this brothers would only have altered
any settled line of conduct, after infinite
heart - searchings and perplexities, they
could not have conceived how simple the
matter appeared to Alvar, when he had
Once made up his mind that he could
possibly have been in fault.

Virginia had said nothing the night
before of her changed prospects; she knew
that the Lesters could have no thought to
spare for her; but when her aunt suggested
sending over to inquire, she could
not pretend ignorance, and her blush and
few words of explanation were enough for
Miss Seyton.

''Ah, well," she said, 'you might have
saved yourselves a great deal of trouble if
you had found this out a little sooner."

We cannot speak of it just now,
auntie."

No ; but you say, don't you, that
everything happens for good ? Now this
good has come out of Cherry's illness ;
perhaps he'll get well."

After these characteristic congratulations

Virginia took lier way to the
vicarage. She found her uncle in his
*' study'* a room which was sufficiently
well lined with ancient and orthodox
divinity to merit the name, though the
highly respectable volumes, descended from
some unwontedly learned Seyton vicar, did
not often see the light.

The parson was looking out of the
window down the road.

Ah, how d'ye do, my dear? " he said,
in unwontedly quiet accents. '' I was just
looking out, for I sent over to Oakby to
inquire how that poor lad is to-day."

"We have heard," said Virginia. ''I
don't think he is any worse. And, uncle,
I saw him yesterday ; he sent for me to
give me a message for you."

*' A message ! Well, my lassie, what
did he say ? "

Virginia came and stood behind the
chair in which her uncle had seated
himself.

He wished me to tell you that he had
been making up his mind to take orders,

and that he loved Elderthwaite so much
that he meant to ask you if you would let
him come and be your curate, that you
and he together might set things right
here. But he said that now that will
never be. And he sent his love, and I was
to ask you to reform Elderthwaite for his
sake. He said, ' Tell him I know he can,
better than any one, if he will.' "

Virginia paused, as her voice faltered.

Why, bless my soul," cried the parson,
' what does the lad mean ? Why, I'm one
of the old abuses myself."

"Yes  yes  uncle. But that is what
he said. You must not be one of the
abuses. He said you might do it all, if
you would, because you love the place
more than any one can."

There was a silence. The parson sat
still.

He is a good lad  he always was a
good lad," he said, after a pause. "And
did he think to come here, to spend his
time over a parcel of scamps and
drunkards ? Eh ! I shouldn't have believed

it. He had heard that they want
me to have a curate, I suppose," he added,
quickly.

Oh, yes, uncle ; but he was afraid that
you would not like it."

'' Look here, my lassie, I like the old
method in his proper place ; but I'll have
no psalm-singers in my church. I'm a
sound Churchman, and I don't approve
of it."

Virginia, finding an objection to psalm-singing
in church rather difficult to reply
to, was silent, and her uncle went on
rapidly,

I hate the whole tribe of your earnest,
hard-working, * self-devoted' young fellows
find it pay, and bring them into the
society of gentlemen  write letters in
trumpery newspapers, and despise their
elders. Newspapers have nothing to do
with religion. The Prayer-book's the
Prayer-book, and a paper's a paper. Give
me Belts Life. Bless you, my dear, do you
think I keep my eyes shut ? "

"You are not just, uncle," said Virginia.

"But Clieriton would not have been like
that."

Mr. Sey ton's twinkling eyes softened,
and the angry resistance to a higher
standard, that mingled with the half-shrewd,
half-scornful malice of his words, subsided,
as he said, in quite a different tone, 

I would have had Cheriton for my
curate, my dear."

He said no more, and Yirgmia could not
press him ; and when he spoke it was only
to question her about Cheriton' s condition.

But when she went away he took his hat
and walked out through his bit of garden
towards the church, and sitting down on
the low stone wall, looked over the churchyard,
where a fine growth of nettles half
smothered the broken gravestones ; and ashe
sat there he thought of his past life, of
his dissipated, godless youth, of the sense
of desperation with which, to pay his debts,
he had '' gone into the Church," of the
horrible evils he had never tried to check,
and yet of the certain kindliness he had
entertained towards his own people. How

he had defied censure and resisted example
till his fellow-clergy looked askance at him,
and though he might affect to despise them,
he did not like their contempt. He thought
of the family crash that was coming, and
he was keen enough to know how he would
be regarded by new comers  " as an old
abuse." And he thought of Cheriton's
faith in him, and the project inspired as
much by love for him as by the zeal for
reform. He thought of the first time he
had read the service, the sense of incongruity,
of shame-sacredness ; how a sort
of accustomedness had grown upon him till
he had felt himself a parson after a sort,
and how, on a low level, he had in a way
adapted his life to the requirements of his
profession.

Then he thought of the way Cheriton had
proposed such a step to himself, and, without
entering into any of those higher
feelings which might have repelled rather
than attracted him, he contrasted with his
his own the unselfishness of the motive
that prompted Cheriton.

He made no resolutions, drew no conclusions,
but unconsciously he was looking
at life from a new standpoint.

Virginia did not see Alvar, nor hear
directly from him all that day ; and but for
the letter in her possession, her interview
with him would have seemed like a
dream.

The next morning was sunny and still.
She stood on the steps at the garden door,
looking over the lawn, now glistening with
thick autumn dew. The sky was clear and
blue, the wild overgrown shrubberies that
shut out the landscape were tinted with
brown and gold, an 'autumn blackbird"
sang low and sweet. All was so peaceful
that it seemed as if ill news could not break
in upon it; yet, as the old church clock
chimed the hour, and through the still air
that of Oakby sounded in the distance,
Virginia started lest it should be the
beginning of the knell. As the sound of
the clock died away, the gate in the shrubbery
clicked, a quick step sounded, and
Alvar came up the path.

Virginia could wait no longer ; fee ran
to meet him, gathering hope from his face
as she approached.

Yes, he is better. There is hope now ;
but all yesterday he grew weaker every
moment. I thought he would die."

x\lvar's voice trembled, and he spoke with
more abandonment than was usual with
him ; he looked very pale, and had evidently
gone through much. He added details of
their suspense, and of Cherry's condition,
as if," Virginia thought, " he wanted to
talk to me."

You are very tired," she said. " Come
in and have some breakfast. Auntie and I

always have it here."

t/

She took him into the drawing-room,
where there was a little table near the fire,
and made him sit down, while she waited
on him, and poured out the tea. She did
not feel a bit afraid of him now, and, spite
of his punctilious gallantry, he submitted
to her attentions without any of the forms
and ceremonies with which he had previously
made a distance between them.

'' You have been up all night. I think
you ought to have gone to bed, instead of
coming here," she said, sure of a contradiction.


' It is a great deal better than going to
sleep to see you, my dear ! " said Alvar,
quaintly; and Virginia thought she liked
the homely English better than the magnificent
Spanish in which he had been wont
to term her his lady and his queen.

''I am getting very hungry, Virginia, "
said Miss Seyton, opening the door. "May
I come in to breakfast ? "

Oh, but that is shocking ! " cried Alvar,
springing up and advancing to meet her.
Miss Seyton, I have brought good news
of my brother. But I must go home now,
he may want me. Perhaps if he is still
better I can come again by-and-by."

Only think," said Virginia, as she went
with him through the garden on her way to
the vicarage to tell the good news to her
uncle, *' only think, when the clock struck
just before you came, I was afraid it was
the beginning of the knell ! "

*' Ah, I trust we shall not hear that
terrible sound now ! " said Alvar, gravely.

And yet before that day closed the old
bell of Elderthwaite church was tolling,
startling every one with the sudden conviction
that that morning's hope had proved
delusory. It frightened Mr. Ellesmere ashe
came home from a distant part of his
parish, though a moment's reflection showed
him that his own church tower was silent.
What could be the matter elsewhere ?

There was a rush of people to the lodge
gates at Oakby, to be met there by eager
questions as to what was the matter at
Elderthwaite ?

'' It must be old Mr. Seyton, took off on
a sudden," they said. *' Well, so long as
Mr. Cherry was getting better  "

-But before curiosity could take any one
down the lane to verify this opinion, up came
the parson's man from Elderthwaite with a
letter for Mr. Lester, and the news that a
telegram had been received two hours
before at the hall, to say that Mr. Holland
had been killed out tiger-hunting in India.

There was more consternation than grief.
Roland had not felt nor inspired affection
in his own family ; in the neighbourhood
his character was regarded with disapproval,
and his sarcastic tongue remembered with
dislike. He had intensified all the worst
characteristics of the family.

Virginia had scarcely ever seen him ;
his father and uncle had so resented his
determination to sell the estate, though, it
had perhaps been the wisest resolve he had
ever come to, that he had been to them as
an enemy.

But still the chief sense in all their
minds was that the definite, if distasteful,
prospect, to which they had been beginning
to look forward, had melted away, and that
all the future was chaos.

Dick, suddenly became a person of
importance, and now within a month or
two of coming of age, was sent for from
London. He had improved in looks and
manner, and seemed duly impressed with
the gravity of the situation. He was told
what Roland's intentions had been, and

that his father's life could not be prolonged
for many months ; listened to Mr. Seyton's
faltering and confused explanations of the
state of affairs, and to his uncle's more
vigorous, but not much more lucid,
denunciation of it. Dick said not a word
in reply, he asked a few questions, and at
last went down into the drawing-room
where his sister was sitting alone. He
walked over to the window and stood
looking out of it.

< Virginia," he said, ' I don't wish to
sell Elderthwaite."

Do you think it can be helped, Dick ? "
she said, eagerly.

'' I don't know. Fm not in debt like
Roland  that is, anything to speak of. I
don't want to wipe the family out of the
county for good and all. Why couldn't
the place be let for a term of years ? "

*' But  it is so much out of repair ! "

Yes," said Dick, shrewdly, ** but it's
an awfully gentlemanly-looking place yet.
Fellows who have made a fortune in trade
want to get their position settled before

they hiiy an estate, or to make a little more
money first. I heard Mr. Stanford talking
about some old place in the south where
there were fine pictures, which had been
let in that way. Well then, of course,
some sacrifices must be made ; something
was doue with the money Cheriton Lester
paid for Uplands. Then there's all that
part out Ashrigg way  Cuddiwell, you
know, and High Ashrigg. Those two
farms have always paid rent. If they
were sold  they're handy either for the
Lesters or the Hubbard  we might put
things to rights a little in that way."

'' I am glad you care about Elderthwaite,
Dick," said Virginia, impetuously.

"Oh, as to that," returned Dick, "I
don't know that I go in for any sentiment
about it. Of course, I couldn't live here
for years to come. I'm not quite such a
fool as I was once, Virginia, thanks to you
and some others I could name; and I
should go on as I am for the present.
But it makes a difference in a man's
position to have a place like this in the

background, even if it is tumbling to
pieces. A girl with money might think
twice whether she wouldn't be Mrs. Seyton
of Elderthwaite."

'' Oh, Dick ! don't marry a girl for her
money," said Virginia, half laughing; but
she could never have imagined herself
listening with so much respect to Dick's
sentiments.

In truth, want of sense and insight had
never been the cause of the Seytons'
errors ; but just as in some men a warm
heart and tender conscience fail to make
head against violent passion, so that they
feel their sins while they commit them, soin
the Seytons a shrewd mental sense of
their own folly had always coexisted with
the headstrong self-will which had overridden
it. Dick had a less passionate
nature, and was, moreover, less at the
mercy of circumstances than if he had
been brought up as the heir, and his friends
in London were sensible people.

"Perhaps," said his sister, 'you might
ask Alvar what he thinks of it."

VOL. HI. T

Alvar ? Oh, lio ! is that come to pass
again ? So, you've made it up. Well,
it is a good thing that you have someone
to take care of you," said Dick,
sententiously.

Alvar was taken into counsel, and the
results of much discussion and consideration
may be briefly told.

Dick's plans were hailed by his father
and uncle as an escape from a prospect-which
had made death doubly bitter to the
one, and the rest of life distasteful to the
other. And an unexpected purchaser of
the two farms was found in Judge Cheriton,
who had been talking for some time of
buying a small property which might be a
home for him when his public career was
over, and a holiday retreat for the present.
There was a farm-house at High Ashrigg
which might be improved into a modern
antique of the style at present admired.
The two farms were therefore purchased at
once of Mr. Seyton himself, and with his
full consent and approval.

The rest of Dick's plan could not be

carried out in his father's lifetime, but it
was agreed to by Mr. Seyton as the best
thing his heir could do.

All this time Cheriton was mending
slowly, but with much uncertainty as to
how far his recovery would be complete.
He very soon detected the turn that Alvar's
affairs had taken, much to his satisfaction ;
but Jack, guessing that the news of Roland's
death would be a shock to him, it was not
till he had begun to insist that his own
state must not again delay Alvar's marriage,
that he heard the story of which it
might have been said ** that nothing in
Roland Seyton' s life became him like the
leaving of it ; " for it proved that he had
met his death by an act of considerable
bravery, which had saved the lives of
others of the party. Perhaps Cheriton,
unable to be intended to the memory of
his boyish ideal, gave him a truer regret
than any of his own family.

He listened with great interest to all
the future arrangements, and was the first
to suggest that his old acquaintance,
T 2

Mr. Wilson's son, was to be married to a
young lady of fortune, and might form a
possible future tenant for Elderthwaite.

As for the rest, even setting her deep
mourning aside, Virginia would not hear
of marrying while her father grew daily
weaker ; nor was Cheriton at all equal to
the inevitable excitement and difficulty of
arranging plans for the winter which must
have ensued.

It ended, as soon as he was able to bear
the journey, in his going to Torquay with
Alvar, to stay for the present. Mrs. Lester
went back to Ashrigg, and Oakby was
once more left solitary.

CHAPTER Xliii.

THE YEOMANRY MEETING.

All's right with the world."

It was a bright morning just before Whitsuntide
in the ensuing year, when the bluebells
Averse still adorning the Elderthwaite
plantations, and the ive on the church was
fresh with young green shoots. Once more
Parson Seyton sat on the churchyard wall
watching his nettles, which now, however,
were falling beneath the scythe, while a
space had previously been carefully cleared
and trimmed round a handsome cross-marked
stone of grey granite which showed
the spot where Mr. Seyton had rested, now
for nearly three months. Suddenly a step
came up the lane and through the gate,
and the parson sprang up joyfully as
Cheriton Lester came towards him.

'' Well, my boy  well ? So here you
are, back at last. And how are you ? "

'' Oh, I am very well  quite well now,"
said Cheriton.

And indeed, though the figure was still
very slight, the hand he held eagerly out
still over white and thin, the colour too
bright and variable for perfect health and
strength, he looked full of life and spirits,
overjoyed, as he said, to find himself at
home again.

'* Oh, yes, Alvar is here, of course, and
we started together ; but we met Virginia
in the lane, and then  I thought I would
come and find you. How lovely it all
looks ! "

Ah, more to sour taste than Mentone ?"

Cherry laughed. '' My taste was always
a prejudiced one," he said ; ' but Mr. Stan-forth
and I were very jolly at Mentone,
especially when Jack joined us. How did
Alvar get on up here by himself at Christmas
? "

He got on very well here  if by here
you mean Eldertbwaite. As for Oakby,

be attended all the dinners and suppers
and meetings and institutions like a hero.
But I suspect he and his tenants still look
on one another from a respectful distance."

Ah, they won't be able to resist him
next week, he'll look so picturesque in his
yeomanry uniform. We shall have a grand
meeting."

The volunteers keep the ground, I
understand ? " said the parson.

'' Yes, myself included. There doesn't
seem to be much for them to do, and they
wished me to come very much. Then,
you know, we have had a grand explanation
about Jack's affairs, and granny and
Nettie have got Gipsy with them ; so Sir
John found out that the pictures wanted
Mr. Stanford, and he is coming down.'
Then Jack couldn't resist, and managed to
get a couple of days' leave. So the only
thing to wish for is fine weather. But I
am not forgetting," continued Cherry, in a
different tone, '' that here you have all had
a good deal of trouble."

*' Well," said the parson, '' it was a great

break up and turn out ; and I'm bound to
own your brother was a great help in
getting through it. Julia, she is gone off
to Bath, and writes as if she liked it ; and
I was very glad that Virginia should stay
here with me for the present. Mr. Wilson
has taken the place for his son, and it is
being put in order. But all in the old
style, you know, Cherry," said the parson,
with a wink, ''no vulgar modernised."

'' Fred Wilson's a very nice fellow," said
Cherry.

He had sat down on the wall by the
parson, and now, after a pause, began
abruptly, 

I saw Dr. A again as we came

through London. He says that I am much
better ; indeed, there is nothing absolutely
the matter with me. I haven't got disease
of the lungs, though of course there is a
tendency to it, and I shall always be liable
to bad attacks of cold. He says I should
be better for some definite occupation,
partly out of doors. He does not think
London would suit me, but this sort of

bracing air might do better than a softer
one, as I was born here, except perhaps
for a month or two in the winter. I may
get much stronger, he thinks, or  But
it was a very good account to get, wasn't
it ? "

'' Yes, my lad, I'm glad to hear it  as
far as it goes," said the parson, looking
intently at him. Cheriton looked away
with deepening colour, and said, rather
formally, 

** I thought that I ought to tell you all
this, sir, because I have never yet felt
justified in referring to what I asked Virginia
to tell you last year. But my wishes
remain the same, and if you think with
such doubtful health I could be of any
service to you or to the place  I  I should
like to try it."

Why, if you have your health, you might
do better than be my curate," said the
parson.

But I won't exemplify a certain
proverb ! In short," said Cherry, looking
up and speaking in a more natural

manner, " if you'll have me, parson, I'll
come."

And suppose I say I won't have you ? "

'' Then I should have to ask the bishop
to find me another curacy," said Cheriton.
'' I have quite made up my mind ; even if
I could follow the career I once looked
forward to, which is impossible, I should
not wish it. I've had some trouble, only
one thing has made it bearable. I should,
like to help others to find that out. But I
want to help my old neighbours most. I
made up my mind with this place chiefly in
my thoughts. I care for it, for many
reasons. But nothing now would induce
me to change my intention of taking orders
if I have the health to carry it out."

An odd sort of struggle was evident in
the old parson's weather-beaten face.

They'd work him to death in some fine
church at a watering-place, with music and
sermons, and all sorts of services," he
muttered to himself.

'' Yes ; I don't think that that would
suit me as well as Elderthwaite."

"Then, my lad," said the parson, with
some dignity, " I will have you. And,
Cherry, I  I understand you. I know that
you have stood by me, ever since you dusted
out the old church for the bishop."

That's just what I want to do now ! "
said Cherry. '' Thank ''ou ; you have
made me very happy. There are Alvar and
Queenie," andwth a hearty squeeze of the
hand he started up and went to meet
them. The parson remained behind, and
as Cheriton moved away from him he lifted
his rusty old felt hat for a moment, and
said emphatically, 

I'm an old sinner ! "

The morning of the Yeomanry Review
dawned fair and bright, and brought crowds
together to the wide stretch of moorland
above Ashrigg, where the review was to
take place. Whitsuntide was a time to
make holiday, and half Oakby and Elder-thwart
was there to see. The only drawback
was that Virginia's mourning was
still too deep to admit of her sharing in so
large a county gathering, for which she

cared the less, as Alvar, in his blue and
silver, mounted on the best horse in the
Oakby stables, and looking as splendid asa
knight of romance, rode round by the
vicarage to show himself to her.

But Parson Seyton was present in a new
black coat and a very conspicuous white
tie, mounted, he assured Cheriton, to do
credit to his future curate.

Cheriton himself appeared in the grey
and green to which he had once been
enthusiastically devoted, and which was
now worn for the last time before he began
his preparation for the autumn ordination.
In the meantime he could stay at Oakby,
while Uplands was being made habitable,
and could begin to feel his way among the
Elderthwaite people, while Virginia was
still there to help him, for she and Alvar
meant to be married quietly in the summer.

But the happiest of all happy creatures
on that bright morning, was perhaps Gipsy
Stanford, as she sat with Nettie and Sir
John and Lady Hubbard, while Jack was
on horseback near at hand. The two young

ladies excited much interest, for it was Miss
Lester's first appearance on leaving school,
and people had begun to sap that she was
a great beauty, as she sat perfectly dressed
and perfectly behaved, her handsome face
with its pure colouring and fine outline as
impassive " as if," thought Dick Seyton,
'' she had never seen a hayloft in her life."

Gipsy, on the other hand, could not help
sparkling and beaming at every pleasant
sight and sound. This was Jack's world,
and it was such a splendid one, and everyone
was so kind to her ; for Nettie, though
she secretly thought Gipsy rather too
clever, knew how to behave to her brother's
betrothed. Gipsy could not keep her
tongue still in her happy exultation, and
very amusing were her remarks and comments,
till, if people came up to the carriage
to look at Miss Lester, they frequently
remained to talk to Miss Stanford.

Her father was in another carriage with
the rest of the Hubbard party, enjoying the
brilliant scene perhaps more than any one
present, since no quaint incident, and no

picturesque combination escaped this keen
and kindly notice.

Nettie looks like coming out sleeps
in Australia in that swell get-up,
doesn't she ? " said Bob to Jack, as the
lead drawn off to a little distance together.

"She doesn't look like it," said Jack;
*' but if she set her mind to that or to anything
else, she would do it."

*' Oh," said Bob, it's all nonsense. I
shan't marry out there. I shouldn't like
a colonial girl  but I shall come home in a
few years' time, and look about me. Nettie
will be married before then, I hope, in a
proper way. I hope you'll all be very
careful about her acquaintances."

"Well, we'll try," said Jack, smiling.
She will have Virginia to go about with."

Yes, I like Virginia. She'll do Alvar
good," said Bob, condescendingly. " And
I like Gipsy too, Jack; she's very

jolly."

Thank you ; " said Jack, " she is."
I suppose you'll be a master in a school
somewhere when I get back, and Cherry

will be. a parson. Yell, he'll make a very
good one."

'' Yes," said Jack, shortly. He did not
like discussions as to Cherry's future; it
hung, in this eyes, by too slender a thread.

*' Good heavens ! " cried Bob, suddenly,
"look there!"

Sir John Hubbard had left his carriage,
and his young horses, which had been
already excited by the numbers and the
noise ; frightened by some sudden chance
movement among the crowd, no one could
tell what  the bark of a dog, the sudden
crossing of an old woman with a tray of
ginger-beer  shed so violently that the
coachman, who was holding the reins loosely,
was thrown off the box, the horses dashed
forward down the hillside, towards an abrupt
descent and break in the ground, at the
'bottom of which ran a little stony brook.

Jack and Bob were far behind, and even
as they spurred forward they felt it would
be all in vain ; while Nettie, springing onto
the front seat, tried to climb up and reach
the reins ; but they swung far beyond her

reach. She looked on and saw all the
danger, saw the rough descent ahead, heard
the cries of horror on all sides, saw too,
one of the yeomanry officers gallop at headlong
speed towards them, dash in between
them and the bank, and seize the reins. A
violent jolt and jerk, as the horses were
thrown back on their haunches, and she
recognized Alvar, as he was flung off his
own horse and down the bank by the shock
and the struggle, as other hands forced the
carriage back from its deadly peril, and
Jack, dashing up, his face white as marble,
dismounted and caught the trembling Gipsy
in his arms.

JSTettie heeded none of them ; she sprang
out and down the bank, and in a moment
was kneeling by Alvar' s side, who lay
senseless. She had lifted his head and
unfastened his collar, before her brothers
were beside her.

'' No, no ; I'll do it," she cried, pushing
Jack's hand aside.

'' Hush, Nettie, nonsense ; let us lift him
up. Get some water."

There were a few moments of exceeding
terror, how few they never could believe, as
they carried Alvar to smooth ground, and
tried to revive him, before he opened his
eyes, looked round, and after a minute or
two, said faintly, 

*what has happened? Ah I remember,"
trying to sit up. " Are they
safe ? "

"Yes yes but you? Oh, Alvar, are
you killed ? " cried Nettie.

''No, no," said Alvar, "my arm is hurt
a little. I think it is sprained  it is nothing.
Do not let Cherry be frightened."

I never thought of him ! " said Jack.
Oh, he won't know anything of it  he is
not here. You are sure your arm is not
broken ? "

No. Ah, there he is ! Help me up,
Jack ! Cherry, it is nothing."

Cheriton, who had been considerately
summoned with the news of a dreadful
accident, but they hoped Mr. Lester was
not killed, was speechless with mingled
terror and relief. He knelt down by

VOL, III. u

Alvar's side, and took his hand, hardly
caring to ask a question as to how the
accident had come about ; but now Sir
John Hubbard's voice broke in, 

I never saw such a splendid thing in
my life, never  the greatest gallantry and
presence of mind ! A moment later and
they would have been over ! My dear
fellow, I owe you more than I can say 
Lady Hubbard, and your own sister, and
Jack's pretty little Gipsy  my horses
starting off in that way. I can never thank
you  never. I couldn't have believed it.
And I thought it was all over with you ! "

I am not seriously hurt, sir," said
Alvar, sitting up, " and there was nothing
else to be done ; it is not worth your
thanks."

Is not it ? " cried Mr. Stanford, unable
to restrain himself. '' More thanks than
can be spoken."

"I'll accept them all for him," said
Cheriton, looking up, his face full of
triumph ; while Nettie, hitherto steady,
broke down, to her own disgust, into sobs.

*' I'm not frightened  no ! " lie said, as
Gipsy tried to soothe her. " But I thought
he wasn't worth anything  and he is ."

*' Come," said Sir John, '' we must not
have any more heroics, and the hero must
go home and rest  to Ashrigg, I mean.
And you too. Cherry, go and look after
him ; here's your grandmother's carriage,
while I see if my horses are fit to be trusted
with the ladies."

Alvar was still dizzy and shaken, though
he said that the hurt to his arm was a trifle,
and now stood up and inquired after his
horse, which had been caught by a bystander,
and was unhurt. Sir John's coachman had
also escaped with some severe bruises ; and
there was a general move. Jack, seeing
Gipsy with her father, followed his brothers,
anxious about them both, and overflowing
with gratitude towards Alvar for his
darling's safety.

But as they turned to drive away they

were obliged to cross the ground, and there

rose from all sides such a thundering shout

as threatened a repetition of the former

u 2

danger ; yeomanry, volunteers, and spectators,
all joining in such an outburst of
enthusiasm as had never echoed over Ash-ring
Moors before. Their driver pulled up
in the centre of the field with the obvious
information, 

They're cheering, sir ; it's for you."

Alvar stood up, with his hand on Jack's
shoulder, and bowed with a grace and self-possession
from which his pale face and
hastily extemporized sling did not detract,
and which his brothers  agitated, and
ashamed of their agitation, were far from
rivalling, as Jack desired the driver to " get
on quick," and Cheriton bent down his head,
quivering in every nerve under the wonderful
influence of that unanimous shout.

Some hours later, as Alvar lay on a sofa
at Ashrigg, resting in preparation for the
public dinner at Hazelbyby, for which everyone
had declared he must be well enough,
the doctor included, he looked at Cherry,
who sat near him, and said, with a smile, 

'* Cherito mio, I think they would all
have grieved for me  the twins and all 

if I had been killed. They would have
been sorry for me  now."

"Don't  don't talk of it. Of course
they would," said Cherry, with a shudder.

Ah ! I fear you will dream of it, as you
used of the mountain at Honda. It will
hurt YOU more than it has hurt me."

''No," said Cherry; "but if we had
lost you ! We can hardly believe yet that
we have you safe."

But," said Alvar, with unusual persistency,
"then you would have been the
squire, after all. Ah ! I am cruel to hurt
you ; but, Cheriton, once they would not
have grieved."

Cheriton could not command an answer,
and Alvar quitted the subject ; but the
unmistakable affection showed to him at
last by his brothers and sister healed the
old wounds as nothing else would have
done.

No one would own that the fright and
agitation demanded a quiet evening, and
the ladies all repaired to Hazelbyby, to sit in
the gallery at the Town-hall to hear the

speeches, Mrs. Lester, who had happily not
been present in the morning, accompanying
them ; and Jack, going to fetch Virginia,
and after overwhelming her with the story
of the alarm, assuring her that she must
come and hear Alvar's health drunk. Sir
John Hubbard intended it should be done.
And so, when the usual toasts were over,
old Sir John rose, and, full of compunction
for past prejudices, and of gratitude for
what Alvar had done for him, said that
this was really the first public occasion
they had had of welcoming Mr. Lester
among them ; spoke of his father's merits,
of the difficulty a stranger might have in
accommodating himself to their north-country
fashions ; touched lightly and
gracefully on the reason of Alvarez recent
absence, and their pleasure in welcoming
back again 'one long known and loved,"
and how much was owing to the elder
brother's care ; hinted how Alvar had won
'one of the best of their county prizes; "
and then, out of the fulness of his heart,
thanked him for his heroic behaviour in

saving the life of Lady Hubbard, and
himself from an irreparable loss, and, moreover,
a frightful sense of responsibility.

Then Alvar's health was drunk with all
the honours, and it was long before the
enthusiasm subsided sufficiently to allow
him to reply.

He stood up, in his unusual height and
dignity, and said, slowly and simply, " I
thank you much, gentlemen. Sir John
Hubbard need not thank me for rescuing
my sister, and the betrothed of my brother.
I was at hand, and of the danger I did not
think." (*' No, no ; of course not," cried a
voice.) " I have been a stranger, but I have
no other country but England now, and it
is my wish to be your friend and your
neighbour, as my father was. I will
endeavour to fill his place to my tenants ;
but I am ignorant, and have little skill. I
think it is not perhaps permitted to me to
name the one who will most help me in
future, one of whom I am all unworthy.
But there is another, who has always
given me love, whom I love most dearly, as

I think you do also. My brother Cheriton
has taught me how to be an English
squire."

And among all those who cheered Alvar's
speech, the voice that was raised the
loudest was Edward Fleming's.

The next morning Cheriton went alone
along the path from Oakby to Elderthwaite.
His great wish was granted; his father's
place would be worthily filled. Alvar
would never be a nobody in the county
again, would never seem again out of
place as their head. All old sores were
healing, all were turning out well  how
much better than he could ever have
hoped !

Even for hopeless Elderthwaite things
looked hopeful ; and Cheriton' s quick and
kindly thoughts turned to his share in the
work of mending them. *' If I may," he
thought, 'but if not, I think I shall never
fear for any one or any place again."

Too much, perhaps, for the impetuous
spirit to promise for itself ; but come what

might, those who loved Cheriton Lester had
little cause to fear for the real welfare of
one who loved them so well and looked
upward so steadily.

EPILOGUE.

*' Mr. Ellesmere ! I saw your name in
the visitors' book. So you are taking a
holiday in Switzerland ? "

"Mr. Stanford! Very glad to meet
you. You will put us up to all we ought
to see and admire. Are you alone ? "

Yes ; you know I have lost my
travelling companion. My next girl is
still in the schoolroom, and I think will
never be so adventurous as Gripsy."

You have good accounts, I hope, of
Mrs. Jack, as we irreverently call her."

'' Excellent ; she adores the boys, and
the boys adore her; her letters are very
educational and aesthetic. She has picked
up more ' art ' as a schoolmaster's wife
than ever she learnt as an artist's daughter,
and could, doubtless, set me right on tones
and colours."

'' Cherry told me that Jack had taken
to the new culture."

'' Yes, he was much amused at the
development produced by house-furnishing.
But double firsts have a right to
vagaries. But tell me something of the
Oakby world. It is a very long time since
I have been there, and one does not see
much of people at a wedding, though I
thought Cheriton looking very well."

Yes, he is fairly well, very useful, and
think, quite content. Alvar has settled
into his position, and fills it well. He is
indignant if he is supposed to be ignorant
of anything English ; and his sweet graceful
wife guides him as much as ' Fanny '
did his father thirty years ago. His one
trouble is that little Gerald is as dark as
all his Spanish ancestors, and even Frances
is like the Seytons, but that he can
fora-iye."

Does she promise to rival her aunt ?
What a beautiful creature Miss Lester is!"

Splendid ! and still Miss Lester, which
is rather a trouble to her grandmother.

Whether she will ever be Lady Milford 
or whether Any way, Nettie can keep
her own counsel."

'' And now, tell me about Elderthwaite.
Has Cheriton justified his experiment?"

'eyes, I think I may say that he has.
He has done a great deal. No one else
could have done so much good, and
certainly no one would have done so little
harm."

And the old parson is resigned to
improvements ? "

Yes, but there have been fewer external
changes than you would expect, or
than Cherry would wish if he were his
own master, or even if he could depend on
himself. But of course his health has
weighted him heavily, and he cannot
promise perfect regularity in services or
arrangements."

I wonder he can manage at all."

Well, I think on the whole his health
has improved, and he is well enough off to
contrive things  has a horse and waggonette
for bad weather; and his house

is near the cliiirch, and lie has built on a
great room to it, and fitted it np with
books and games, and he makes a sort of
club of it for the boys and young men.
His sitting-room opens into it, and he has
classes and talks, and gets them to come
and see him one by one. If he cannot do
one thing he does another. And they
have evening services in the summer, and
early ones when it is possible. I think
the sort of resolute way in which Cheriton
has recognized the need of special care of
himself, if he is to be useful, and carries it
out, is one of the most remarkable things
about him. Many young men might have
killed themselves with hard work, and
many would forget the danger when welland
in good spirits, but he has recognized
the limitations set to him, and bows to
them."

'eyes, and he does not offend his vicar."

'rarely, he has never failed to recognize

his right to respect  never allowed the

Wilson, who are ardent and enthusiastic,

to force anything on him. And there's a

great change. I don't mean that the old
fellow is cut after any modern pattern yet;
but lie is considerably more decorous, and
sometimes there's a sort of humility about
him in admitting his shortcomings that is
very touching. Cherry is the very light
of his eyes."

And how does Cherry hit it off with
the modern element ? "

Well, there I think his position has
been a great advantage to him ; they are a
little afraid of him. But he gets on
admirably with them, and you know they
have improved the church immensely this
last year, and what is more to the point,
perhaps, it is filled with good congregations."


Is Cheriton a fine preacher ? "

Well, his people like him. I have
rarely heard him ; he is very difficult to
get. Yes, I like his sermons; but he has
not much voice, you see, and his manner
is very quiet. He has not the sort of
vehement eloquence you might have expected.
I made some comment once to

him, and lie looked at me, and said, ' I
aren't get eager and tire myself.' I saw
then how little strength he had to work
with."

"Poor fellow! But this life  does it
satisfy him ? Is he happy in it ? "

He is just as merry and full of fun as
ever. He has a wonderful capacity for
taking an interest in every one and everything
; and though Alvar does not depend
on him in the old exclusive way, he is
most tender and careful of him, and
Cherry delights in the children. I think
Jack's marriage was rather a wrench;
those two do cling together so closely,
and Jack was a great deal with him ; but
still there are grand plans for the holidays,
and he is very fond of your daughter."

I don't think that marriage will loosen
the tie."

No ; and he is much too unselfish
really to regret it. Then all his village
boys bring him pets ; he says everything
makes a link from a horse to a hedgehog.
And my curates and the Ashrigg ones run

after him, and think it a privilege to take
a service for him; and he has done one
rather feather-pated fellow, I know, a
world of good."

That I can believe''

Yes ; for, after all, Mr. Stanford, it is
not his being a Lester of Oakby, nor a
man of meaDS, nor his wonderful tact, nor
even his great charm of manner in itself
that counterbalances his weak health and
frequent absences, or makes a life spent
among rather uncongenial elements sufficient
to him. It is that he has the root of
the matter in him as very few have. What
he does and says may be less in quantity,
but it is infinitely above in quality the
ordinary work of his profession. He looks
deep and he looks high, and men feel it.
He has come through much tribulation,
and  well, Mr. Stanford, the dragon
slayers have their reward."

Yes, one must touch a high note in
thinking of him."

So high, that one fears ' to mar by
earthly praise,' one who I verily believe is

as true a saint, as full of love and zeal. 
Well, being so, as I truly think, lie has
what some holy souls have lacked, the gift
of a gracious manner and a most sympathetic
nature ; and if a few more years
and a little more experience could be
granted to him, I believe he will have a
great spiritual influence, if not wide, deep.
Any way he will leave in one place the
memory of a pure and holy life, and will
lead others to follow the Master he loves
so well."
