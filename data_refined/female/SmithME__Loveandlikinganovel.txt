 "Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee mirthful jest and

Sakdycot was on the sea and a favourite

resort in the winter of impecunious and enervated

fashion, for Sandycot was salubrious

and cozily sheltered from the east wind. There

were hills behind and on each side, and in the

front a broad sea-level of golden sand circling

' the outline of the town and stretching away

J for miles to right and left till abruptly closed

sin by overhanging cliffs. The town did not

 touch the picturesque or the sublime. It

cJ was built of dazzling white stone, was orderly

jand regular in its arrangement, and intensely

modern in its aspect. Its architectural aspects

had only achieved the commonplace.

VOL. I. 1

It had been called into existence by the
railway, which brought it into direct communication
with London ; but Sandycot was
three hundred miles from the metropolis, a
fact which kept it select in the excursion
train and tourist season, and enforced exceptionally
moderate rents during the winter.
A long imposing pier shot out into what was
popularly termed the harbour, but no seasons:
craft ever cast anchor in its shallow
waters, which at the ebb of tide receded
to the extent of fully a mile. But when the
tide flowed high, pleasure boats came and
went, and small trawlers to supply the piscatory
needs of the inhabitants.

Little more than a generation ago Sandycot
had been the merest fiction of a village, a
little unknown hamlet, with but one small
church of no particular period or architecture,
of no genteel traditions, and with only
headstones and rough-hewn slabs, with here
and there a death's-head and crossbones for
monumental sculpture. A handsome edifice
now stood on its site, and in the stead of the
crony old parson who had held on Sundays

regulation ritual within its dreary walls, and
had on week-days tilled his glebe land with
his own hands, a smart ecclesiastic and two
smooth-faced curates ministered to the spiritual
wants of the people. Modern, commonplace,
and traditionless, Sandycot left nothing to be
desired by its conventional frequenters.

The principal country town of the district,
Nettlethorp, lay some miles inland, but it was
now deserted by the gentry, who with one
consent kept their high-days and holidays in
gay Sandycot, only once in the year rallying
under the old flagstaff of its venerable town-hall,
on the occasion of what from time immemorial
had been known as the county ball.
This ball was as exclusive as ancient Alack's,
and Sandycot was sparsely represented. To
have been at the county ball seemed tantamount
in the eyes of Sandycot to a presentation
at St. James'. It was the linoerinCT
element of a departing assumption, one of the
still recognized prerogatives of a class helplessly
drifting towards extinction.

One of the few remaining mansions still in
possession of the original owners was Egbert

12

Hall. This old manor-house had been in the
Egbert family for five hundred years, during
which period a male heir had not failed in the
direct line. With the failure of such heir
the strict entail would end.

This evil day had been more than once imminent,
and some curious family traditions
existed of how the calamity had been averted,
but these belonged to the " good old times "
and according to the simple plan 

That they should take who had the power,
And they should keep who can."

The present proprietor of the manor-house,
Edgar Egbert, or " the Squire " as he was
commonly called, was a widower with three
maiden daughters of a certain age. His only
son had been drowned when a lad, and the
dreaded day had at last arrived when Egbert
House should cease to be represented by one
of the nobler sex.

In hopes of still averting this misfortune
the squire had been urged by his daughters
to marry again. but his heart was true to the
one love of his life, his dead wife, and he
refused to call another by that sacred name.

I would rather see a stranger in my chair
than in hers," was his conclusive answer to
his daughters' pleading.

It was not aversion to matrimony that had
kept the Miss Egbertss single, it was mischance.
They had all been in their early youth good-looking,
and had not lacked wooers, but an
ill-fate had attended their several engagements,
and now, at the period when this tale
begins, they had, to all appearance at least,
settled resignedly down into a state of single
blessedness.

Mabella was the name of the eldest Miss
Egbert, Dulcibella of the second, and Isabella
of the third. Sybella was six years the junior
of Mabella.

They lived the year round at Egbert Hall,
with an annual interregnum of two months at
Sandycot, where they owned one of the few
old houses that lingered on the outskirts of
the town.

This house was named Egbert Lodge. It
was square, of grey stone, unpretending, but
substantial-looking, and to the last extreme
comfortable with old-fashioned comfort within.

About two acres of ground were laid out
in an old-world garden and orchard, with, in
the front, concession to the modern needs of
a lawn, which had done duty for a croquet-ground
when that game held its day, but was
now transformed into a lawn-tennis inclosure.
Much hospitality was observed in Egbert
Lodge.

The Sandycot season had just commenced.
It had opened propitiously, the weather being
exceptionally favourable. Every house was
occupied and the hotel crowded.

The Miss Egbertss had arrived at the Lodge
a week earlier than their wont, in anticipation
of a visitor in the person of a fair young girl
of some eighteen summers to whom they bore
a distant cousinship.

This cousinship, which from its remoteness
might in families prolific in offshoots have
been ignored or lightly regarded, was by
the Miss Egbertss invested with the importance
attached to articles of vertu which, if
destroyed, can never be replaced.

Relationship in the Egbert family had, with
few exceptions, become traditions.

Judith Aylmere  " Judy " lier intimates
called her  was, however, no tradition ; she
was a reality, and to her far-away Egbert
cousins a very tangible link to a place among
the living. The cousinship was distilled
through the squire's grandfather, whose
brother had married a Mabella Aylmere, and
the only issue of this marriage, a daughter,
having married an Aylmere cousin, gave to
posterity one son, Edgar Egbert Aylmere, the
father, dead of late years, of the Judy of our
tale.

Judy, too, was an only child, and from the
present position of things it seemed not at all
unlikely that she would succeed the last of the
Egbertss in possession of the old family property.
There were none with nearer claim of
Egbert blood, and with the present squire
the strict entail ended. It was, in fact, in the
squire's power to re-entail the lands, or to
leave them absolutely to whom he would.
Judy's possible inheritance was an eventuality
greatly considered by her mother, a widow on
a small jointure. To Judy herself it was as a
far-off vision, a possibility of a future she did

not care to anticipate, even in thought. She
was not given to castle-building, and youth
with its golden present was hers.

This visit to Sandycot was the first in her
character of debutante ; hitherto she had been
received as a holiday schoolgirl, and her
bondage accruing to that status had not been
pleasant.

The day of her arrival at Egbert Lodge
happened to be the day the Miss Egbertss
received  their day at home according to the
now accepted custom.

The room was full when Judy entered it,
and, somewhat bashful, she hesitated as she,
self-announced, opened the door. Her 
was in her hand, and her hair, tied ina
loose bunch behind, fell below her waist.
Judy was not shy by nature, but she was not
always self-assured, and the sudden sight of
the gathered company, talking, moving and
laughing, for the moment checked her advance.
Mabella was the first to notice the
new arrival ; she was seated near the
door, talking with rather a conscious air
to a distinguished-looking man, whose

bearing pronounced him of the military
profession.

Judy ! " lie said, rising and holding out
both hands in warm greeting, which was emphasized
by a kiss on either cheek. In this
Dulcibella and Sybella followed suit, and then
Judy was formally introduced to such of the
company as were her cousins' intimates, but
among these the gentleman in question was
not included. Leaving Judy with Sybella,
who distributed the tea in a recess, Mabella
returned to her seat and her companion.

Who is that Mabella is making herself so
agreeable to ? " asked Judy of Sybella.

Major Tyler," was the curt reply.

The asperity of Sybella's tone warned Judy
not to pursue her inquiries. She merely added :

A handsome man, but not over pleasant -
looking."

Oh," said Sybella, who was given to detraction,
" outward looks and inward graces
don't always go together."

She could not tell why  she was, indeed,
unconscious of the fact  but by some unrecognized
but all-powerful magnetic force her

eyes constantly turned to Mabella's chair and
the dark commanding stranger bending towards
it, and as often, as if by an equally
sympathetic power of attraction, his eyes
at the moment sought hers. Judy became
flushed and angry with herself.

"He'll think I'm admiring him," she said
to herself with a switch round of her banded
locks, " and I'm only wondering what he and
Mabella can have to say to each other all this
time."

'Not one of the company broke in on that
tete-astute ; discreetly all eyes were turned in
other directions. Judy began to move about
the room and to greet acquaintances. She
received congratulations on her emancipation
from school bondage and compliments
on her blooming countenance, which was
ruddy with youth and happiness. The face
was a rounded oval, and the features, though
not actually irregular, were still too piquant
to be deemed of any distinct form of beauty.
The small arched mouth, straight but abruptly
pert-looking nose, soft laughing eyes, and low
broad brow, over which the hair fell in

natural flakes and little feathery curls, made
a very lovely and unique picture of fresh
innocent maidenhood, pure English in type
and country in breeding, for there was nothing
of the town miss about Judy. The incidental
whispers that connected her possible future
with the old Eo-bert estates invested her with
a certain marketable value in the eyes of
Sandycot matrons, and, in the regards of

the grandes dames par excellence of shire

with a consideration and appreciation a city
heiress with treble the amount in present and
hard cash had failed to elicit. For the rest,
she was of middle height, almost defiantly
erect, every line rounded, every curve graceful.

In her progress round the room she arrived
at the corner occupied by Mabella and Major
Tyler, when, at a whispered request from the
latter, Mabella caught her by her pendent
parasol, saying :

Judy, child. Major Tyler wishes to be
introduced to you," which intimation Judy
received with a stiff little courtesy and, to her
extreme mortification, an intense blush.

Now Judy was rather given, when unduly

repressed, to forcible expression. She had a
little repertory of her own, a demonstrative
but in no way an offensive one. On this she
drew as occasion gave rise. " My safety valve,"
she called this reserve, with which, however,
she never flagrantly transgressed either refined
sensibilities or honest prejudice. They had
come to be regarded by her intimates as a bit
of Judy, and so not to be judged on their own
merits, and Judy was, as every one knew,
quite unlike any one else. To her mother,
who was both commonplace and narrowly
conventional, they had come to be a relief
also, for Judy was of a fiery nature, and one,
or two at most, of such expletives invariably
dispersed a summer cloud.

The major returned her frigid obeisance
with a low bow and, as her quick eye observed,
a self-satisfied smile.

I thought it was one of the Needs when
I saw you enter the room," he said, " a vision
of the sea."

Bosh ! " muttered Judy ; when, feeling relieved,
she said simply, " A watery compliment,
is it not, Mabella ? "

Evidently used from the same quarter to
something of stronger flavour, Mabella looked
at the major with a conscious simper and said,
I am afraid Judy, like her name, is not
poetical."

Judith is poetical enough," said the major
deprecatingly ; " it is redolent of poetical
associations."

Which I am not," replied Judy ; then
turning sharply, as if on a pivot, she
added, "Where is cousin Egbert, Mabella?
I shan't feel I've come till I get his double
kiss."

Would a substitute do ? " slyly whispered
the major.

Ask Mabella," was the mischievous reply,
and then Judy catching sight of the squire
through the windows which opened to the
ground walked impetuously away and the
next minute was seen clasping her cousin
round the neck, returning with interest his
double salute. Again by the same occult
force she turned her eyes in the direction
of the retired corner where sat Mabella and
her slightly distrait major, and again over

the gentleman's countenance passed the same
irritating smile of conscious power.

Judy's impulses carry her out of herself,"
said Mabella apologetically ; " she will tone
down in time."

"She could not have better models of all
womanly graces than in her cousinhood of
Egbert Lodge," was the low and somewhat
stilted reply  a reply, though, eminently judicious,
as it implied that in the major's eyes
extreme youth lacked the womanly graces of
maturer years.

Who is Mabella's friend, cousin Egbert ? "
asked Judy, subsiding on the squire's arm and
drawing him towards the back of the house,
that she might, as she said, shake hands with
Tim  Tim beings a small bull-terrier who on

o

receiving days was not allowed to mix with
the family.

Were you not introduced ? " asked the
squire.

Of course we were," she answered sharply,
and we're both as wise as before. He had
never heard of me, I saw that at a glance,
and I most certainly had not heard of him, so

all I know is that he is a Major Tyler, and I
suppose he thinks me a bread-and-butter
miss."

Well, Judy, you know about as much as I
do," and the squire's kindly face took a shade
of care. " He was in the 6th Dragoons, saw
some service in India, I believe, and sold out
just before the new Army BilL Who the
Tyler are, goodness may know, but not I."

Do you like him, cousin Egbert ? "

He is an agreeable companion," was the
evasive reply.

Does Sybella like him ? "

Dulsie does."

Oh, cousin Egbert, you sinuous evader,
just as if you could elude me," and Judy's
laugh rang out in a silvery key, to which
came a response in the shape of a sharp yelp.
"That's Tim, downright Tim," she cried,
quickening the squire's movements by a
vigorous pull, at the same time putting to
her lips a tiny gold whistle suspended to her
watch-guard, and blowing a shrill blast. By
the time they had arrived at the little outhouse
in which for the nonce Tim was confined,

the flooring was strewed with fragments
of the panelling of the door, torn off in the
frantic efforts of the dog to Liberate himself to
greet his well-beloved playmate.

*' No two words about liking or disliking
with Tim," cried Judy, lifting the little animal
and kissing him between the eyes.

The squire laughed.

The major knows that to his cost," he
said.

How does he get over the difficulty with
Mabella ? " asked Judy ; " it's ' love me, love my
dog,' you know, and I'm afraid it's only the
few who appreciate Tim."

"The very few," said the squire, looking at
the animal now " doing statue " as Judy said ;
that is, he had subsided into fixed stillness
against the shut door of his prison. He was
seated on his hind legs, perfectly erect, his
front legs stuck straight out and wide apart,
his little round bull-head, with its thick undershot
jaw, fierce nostril, and protruding eyes of
fiery black, turned up at Judy, imploring,
adoring and defying.

I think you had better put him up now,"

suggested the squire, and he put out his hand
to open the door. A low determined growl
dared him to effect his purpose.

Timothy," said Judy.

Back went all that was left of ears, but only
a quiver from nose to tail answered to the
remonstrating' utterance. 'k m:

"Timotheus." ' -m:-

Another quiver, but not a stir.  f.;;

Cousin Egbert  open, please."

The squire lifted the latch, bending guardedly
across the animal which now quivered violently,
but still stirred not an inch. '

Tim," said Judy in a tone of appeal, and
Tim made a spring forward. Xot in time
though, for the latch lifted, the door swung
back, and suddenly losing his support he
rolled over backwards. Before he could recover
himself the squire had once more closed
the door. . j

Kinder mean that," cried Judy, laughing ;
another minute and he would have walked
in of his own accord ; now there'll be no
quieting him." r -

"Get him a bone," said the squire.

VOL. I. 2

A bone indeed ; Tim lias a soul above
bones ; treat me fair, is all he asks. Oh, cousin
Egbert, there are dog souls as well as human
souls ; it's a very responsible world is this."

She then cautiously opened the door and
let herself in, drawing it after her. In a few
moments Tim's indignant howls had subsided
into an occasional fretful yelp ; then these, too,
ceased, and when Judy issued forth he had
retired to his basket in the corner and had
curled himself up in obedient resignation, to
wait, as Judy had admonished him, " till the
quality had gone." " You may look at him,
cousin Egbert." This from a prudent distance
the squire did, observation which Tim returned
with a snarl of disgust.

The company had all dispersed dien Judy,
accompanied by the squire, re-entered the
drawing-room ; all but two. Major Tyler and
a youth apparently about twenty-three years
old. The name of this youth was Lawson,
Edward, otherwise Ned Lawson.

Judy and Mr. Eawson were evidently no
strangers to each other, and they where as
evidently pleased to meet again ; but while

Judy's greeting was frank, Mr. Eawson's was
constrained ; and as if from, what did not
appear to be this temperament, slyness, he
blushed.

Father dear," said Mabella, " Mr. Eawson
will dine with us," an announcement which
seemed to please the squire. " I am surprised,
Judy," said Mabella, " that a young man like
Mr. Eawson should blush upon being introduced
to a girl like you, a mere schoolgirl."

Now, Mabella, that is spiteful," cried
Judy with unruffled good-humour ; " and I
had my portfolio on the top of my trunk to
show this very night, now I shan't. A schoolgirl
indeed! Why, my head of Socrates in
chalks would turn you white with envy ; and
as for my Melrose Abbey by moonlight, no
room for masterly strokes there to finish off,
it's all master strokes," and she laughed.

I should think it was," said Sybella ;
why, child, you never could draw even a
stick."

Sever tried," said Judy slyly, looking
from under her eyes at the youngest Miss
Egbert, who was thin of visage and formal.

22

But, you see, that is the advantage of a
boarding-school," she continued, as if afraid
of being anticipated ; " there our deficiencies
are supped. Now you had governesses at
home, just another name for self-development."


"Well, Judy, there is one thing I'm glad
of," said Squire Egbert as he opened the door
at the sound of the warning gong for dinner
and with old-fashioned courtesy bowed his
daughters and their merry young cousin
out.

What's that, cousin Egbert ? " she asked.

That, for your tongue's sake, you hadn't a
governess at home."

Well," she retorted, determined to have
the last word, " self-development and self-creation
are sometimes convertible terms."

"Judy dear," said Mabella as she looked
into the former's room to see that all was, as
she expressed it, " comfortable," " whatever
will Major Tyler think of you ? "

He has no notion of thinking of me," was
the pointed answer ; " he's thinking of someone
else. Why didn't you tell me about him

in your letters ?  not even Dulsie gave me a
hint."

A hint of what ? " and Mabella tried to
look dignified and repressive, but only succeeded
in looking important and conscious.

Why, that there was such a handsome fascinating
stranger in Sandycot. You didn't
wish to turn my head in prospective, I suppose.
But no fear, cousin mine, this little
knowledge-box," and Judy shook the organ in
question till the small flaky curls on her brow
danced up and down as if in derision, "is too
well weighted to be easily overbalanced."

"Ah, Judy dear," said Mabella, suddenly
relaxing, and at the same time hastening away,
the heart and the head are different things."

<E

' Love me, love my dog."

By Jove," said Judy to herself as the door
closed on the substantial spinster, " by Jove,
she's bit."

A very few minutes sufficed to make Judy's
simple toilette, and then waiting for Mabella's
maid to add some finishing touches she
threw herself into a low easy-chair, to have
a " think," as she phrased it.

Judy's eyes were arch and blue ; these
she closed, that nothing? miofht distract her
introspective vision. Her lips were arched
in a true Cupid's bow ; she pursed them
firmly, that they might not easily relax into
a frivolous smile. Her chin, which had a
decided cleft in the centre, rested on the
partially folded fingers of one hand, while
the other lay under her recumbent head.
One tiny arched foot was crossed over the

Other, but these, as the nimble thoughts
flew through the busy little bran, changed
place continuously ; in her stillest of moods
there was no motionless rest in Judy. And
as she pondered, light and shade chased each
other over her bright child-like countenance,
the only tell-tales of the active agitation
within. Insensibly the shadows came thicker,
the little feet ceased their motion, the fingers
grasped the cleft chin closer, and the eyelids
wrinkled till the long silken lashes quivered
as in sympathy.

Suddenly the gong boomed out its summons
to dinner, and with a start and a jump Judy
returned to the outer world.

For one minute, no longer, she stood before
the long mirror in her toilet-table, light
stru2"G[linf back on her disturbed visage ;
then turning abruptly on her heel she said
in a sharp self-contemptuous tone, "Bosh!"
and evidently much relieved and quite herself
again, she opened the door and ran
singing downstairs, kissing her hand gaily
to Tubbs, Miss Egbert's maid, in token that
she was too late to be of service.

But that night, before retiring to rest, she
wrote in the seclusion of her bedchamber
a little note to her mother, destined for the
early morning post, and supplementary to the
post card she had despatched by the evening
mail to tell of her safe arrival.
. The note was as follows :

- " My dearest Mammy, 

As I promised to tell you if Xed " 
here she altered the Xed to Mr.  "Mr.
Eawson appeared on the Scene, I send you
a little note to say he has, looking, too, as

stu ," another alteration  " steeped in

nothing as ever." (" That's a happy phrase,"
she said to herself complacently, " but it will
be lost on mamma," and she sighed ; " mamma
is so matter-of-fact.") She then resumed : "He
has not arranged a career yet, he tells me."
(" She'll understand that ; ' arrange ' is a stock
word of mamma's") "He is ' too old' for the
army, fears it is rather late to begin for the
Church, would rather die than be a doctor,
and has no opinion of farming as a paying
industry ; and the provoking part of it is,

there is a ring of true metal in the man " 
another erasure, and " lad " substituted ;  " for
when Major Tyler  I'll tell you about him
directly  sneered and said, ' He must invent
an occupation to suit this young gentleman,'
he replied quite simply, ' Civilization has
anticipated you ; I think of politics.' ' And I
wonder what politics will think of you ? '
answered the major, very impudently I say.
Just what metaphysics and philosophy and
all the rest of it did,' cried I, like a quixotic
idiot. 'Why, he is Bea. of Oxford, an honour-man,
too, and was stroke-oar in the last race
as well.' I knew I had made a eoose of
myself, for sed  Mr. Eawson  looked so
delighted, and there really was no substantial
cause, and Major Tyler so viciously pleased.
Miss Aylmere,' he said to Mabella, whose
side he never leaves  but more of that
hereafter  ' Miss Aylmere would make an
invaluable special pleader. I advise her to
study the law if she, like our young friend
here, wants a career.' Then before I could
even fire up, Ned (Mr. Eawson) turned him
over  metaphorically of course  so neatly.

I have known many a woman who would
have been an ornament to any profession,
he said, ' and I am sure if Miss Aylmere '-
he very nearly said Judy  ' chose such a
Career she would never stop short in the
middle.'

Oh, mammy, it was splendid, though I
don't think Mabella quite took it in ; but
Sybella did, and, I fancy, cousin Egbert too.
As for Mabella and Didcie, they make a
perfect deity of the major, and who he is
beyond his profession, which he has cut short
in the middle, no one seems to know. You
know I am witch about people and believe
in first impressions, so before going down to
dinner I had a good think over this Major
Tyler, and analyzed my feelings about him ;
for, you see, he is not an ordinary man, to be
looked at in an ordinary way and forgotten
or remembered in an ordinary fashion. He is
distinguished handsome and at a very fascinating
age, under forty, and has a manner of
perfect breeding, and a self-assertive dignified
rather than high-bred air ; but that is, I fancy,
because he is too self-conscious to be immobility

indifferent. One can feel the sort
of air ; that is, a sort of tip-toe celestial elevation
in an abstractedly unconscious look from
tip of toe to tip of nose. I should like to
prick one of those Large whipcord veins on
the back of his handsome hand and see if
it really has blue blood. Xed's  that is, Mr.
Eawson's  have, I'm sure ; perhaps if they
hadn't he'd understand about ' getting on '
better, for I do believe, mammy, that it
requires a certain amount of vulgarity to
get on in this pushing, crowded world ; it is
only geniuses that soar, and geniuses, alack-a-day,
don't grow like brambles ; but there's a
dash of genius in Xed, if he only knew it.
Perhaps politics will tell him. I think I'll
study Stewart Mills' and Smith's political
economy, just to see what it's like.

"But here I am, rattling away. I was
telling you my first impressions of this Major
Tyler ; I think he's clever, determined, ambitious
and cold-hearted, and I'm quite sure,
though he has three medals, that he is
very far from brave. I am sure, as a piece
of outside observation, that he is laving

siege to Mabella, and that cousin Egbert
knows it and does not approve. Mabella's
eye when it meets mine is full of portent.
Dulcis is evidently in love through sympathy,
and she is sure to tell me all about it tomorrow
; but Mabella won't, unless she wants
my help. To tell you the truth, the situation
is exciting. I should be sorry to see dear old
Mabella unhappy, and if she is foolish enough
to marry this fortune-hunting major, unhappy
she will be.

Your loving daughter,

Judy.

Pes.  Tim doesn't like him one bit ; he
likes Ned  Mr. Eawson  though. Is it not
odd what good judges of character dogs
are ? "

This letter reached its destination, Eingwood
Terrace, Casterham, a town in Suffolk, some
fourteen hours' journey by rail from Sandycot,
by an early post. Mrs. Aylmere, who was
methodical to tediousness, waited till her
breakfast was over and her simple household
arrangements for the day completed before

she broke the cover. Accustomed as she
was to Judy's confidential and discursive
epistles, this one seemed more difficult to
construe, as she expressed it, than usual,
for Judy's mother was slow of understanding.
But as is the case with persons not quick at
immediate apprehension, once she had taken
in a point, or fully understood a situation, her
judgment was sure to be clear and her action
judicious. Between mother and daughter
perfect affection and trust existed, tempered
on the mother's side with a slight uncertainty
as to the possibilities of youth. Judy had
never had a secret from her mother, and if
the mother had not always been equally open
her reticence arose only from a wise discretion,
which could bear necessary burdens in silence.
But disposition, too, in this particular had its
sway, for while Judy was too apt to wear her
heart on her sleeve, Mrs. Aylmere was by
nature secretive. She was never averse to
a mystery, and rather enjoyed attaining a
coveted end by the exercise of what she
termed "a little diplomacy." She was, too,
at heart not a little worldly, and overvalued,

in a higher degree than her daughter undervalued,
the good things of this Use.

To see Judy well married, the ivell having
no possible limit, and her more than probable
inheritance of Egbert Hall an established fact,
were the two great ambitions of the lone
woman's life. To aid and abet the furtherance
of these ambitions in ever' honest and
feasible manner was the work she had laid
out for her right hand to do when the
necessity should arise and the opportunity
occur. Occasionally during her late husband's
life she had spent a Christmas at
Egbert Hall, but since her widowhood she
had not left her home, which with reduced
means she had made in the small country
town of Casterham. With the Miss Egbertss
Mrs. Aylmere was by no means a favourite.
They had, though they said little about it,
intense pride of birth and a mere civil tolerance
for what they were pleased to regard as
the inferior professions. Mrs. Aylmere had
been the daughter of a country surgeon, a
clever and a good man, but to the Egbertss
of Egbert Hall of no separate individuality,

professionally considered, from a chemist or
small apothecary. This, Judy's mother knew
well, but there was too much at stake for
reprisals or even quiescent resentment ; she
quietly accepted the position of an inferior
for her child's sake, keeping herself as much
in the background as possible, and investing
Judy on every occasion with everything that
could tend to strengthen her connection with
her cousins. For this purpose some old lace
of distinct Egbert origin had proved useful,
some pieces of doubtful Sevres china, but undoubted
Egbert traditions, and some otherwise
valueless trinkets. Pew women with such
slender stock-in-trade had already achieved so
much. These few relics, judiciously employed,
had very materially strengthened the slender
cousinship and helped to bring the far-away
point at which it had begun into present
reality. So an old ring of yellow topaz, encircled
with pearls, and engraved inside with
the initials " M. E.," Judy regarded with the
reverence in which a talisman might be held,
so earnestly had her mother enjoined her to
hold it as a possession and to wear it always.

Its history, as instilled into her by her mother,
she had told Mabella. The M. E. stood for
the Mabella Egbert, wife of the squire's
grand-uncle, whose only daughter had married
an Aylmere and had become the mother of
Judy's father. She had been Mabella's godmother.
It pleased the Miss Egbertss to seethe
reverence in which Judy held the ring,
and disposed them to think approvingly of
her mother. To it they added other relics in
kind, but of a higher value, an earnest, Mrs.
Aylmere believed, of Judy's inheritance in
the future.

Mrs. Aylmere's blood ran cold when Judj's
letter was mastered ; she let it fall in her lap.
She shuddered: "And to think that Judy doesn't
see the consequences ! It's all that Mr. Lawson,
with his ' stroke-oar ' indeed and ' blue
blood,' his empty college honours and pockets;
just the hero for a romantic girl in her teens.
And this Major Tyler  Judy's sure to make
an enemy of him with her sharp tongue, and
of Mabella too. I must go to Sandycot."

This determination, sudden as it was, was
none the less a fixed resolve ; it only remained

to bring it about naturally. In this the
diplomacy Mrs. Aylmere affected served her
well. She resolved to let her house.

It was full summer, and Casterham being
within easy distance by rail of London was
a favourite resort of city toilers, who took
the small houses offered for the vacation
weeks by residents also in need of change,
and paid liberal prices. Eingwood Terrace
was favourably situated for letting : the houses
were semi-detached, each with a pretty conservatory
in front and good-sized garden at
rear. It was also within ten minutes' walk of
the railway station, and an equal distance from
the river, which was much resorted to for boating
purposes. Circumstances favoured Mrs.
Aylmere's wishes. The local agent provided
her with a suitable tenant before the week
was out, and then she indited a well-weighed
though seemingly hasty epistle to Mabel.
The epistle we shall see later.

In the meantime the little drama at Sandy-cot
moved slowly on the boards. The squire
had lost much of his old heartiness, and
now seldom stayed at the Lodge more than

VOL. L 3

two days at a time, the crops, or young stock,
or other farming excuse taking him frequently
to Egbert Hall.

The very next time you go, cousin
Egbert," said Judy on the occasion of his
last somewhat sudden departure, " I go with
you."

*rand so you shall, Judy; mind, it's a
promise," was the hearty answer as he
mounted his dog-cart to drive to the
station.

When the squire was absent the dinner-hour
at the Lodge was two, but at eight there
was always a substantial supper, which practically
was a dinner. To this meal, being
informal, casual guests were often invited.
There was, however, one guest who, though
he had ceased to be invited, yet was never
absent ; this was Major Tyler. Mr. Eawson
was also a frequent addition, but always by
express invitation, given invariably by Mabella
from interested motives. She found that
when that gentleman was present Judy was
subdued both in manner and speech, and
apparently not so keen in observation  conditions

certainly' by no means normal in that
lively young lady.

I do not think you should encourage Mr.
Eawson, Mabella," Sybella had urged; "Judy
seems inclined to Uke him, and he has no
prospects."

Oh, Judy likes to amuse herself, but she's
quite heart-oriole ; that I'm sure of," said
Mabella.

Well, I, for one, set my face against any
man without a calling, and Judy is too good
to be Avast."

"You did not always, Sybella."

Xo, but I learnt wisdom, and I should be
sorry to see Judy taught in the same school."

"You are not so wholly on the shelf,
Sybella, that you need speak of yourself in
that way," said Mabella tartly.

Not wholly learnt wisdom, do you mean?"
was the retort given acridly. " Oh, yes,
Mabella, my days of glamour were all over
before little Judy was born ; I wish I Could
say the same for others."

Mabella flushed.

Mr. Eawson is trying for a secretaryship

3-2

to some statesman or public man," she said,
to turn the edge of the subject aside. " Papa
says he is a born politician."

With opinions on the wrong side, eh ? "

"I don't know that; papa says it is difficult
to know what he is ; he himself says he does
not believe in party, and that great questions
have always been settled from a single point
of view, one master-mind directing."

And so forming party."

"You are captious, Sybella; but of this rest
assured, that Judy will have nothing to say to
a man who has no calling or profession, and
if Mr. Eawson makes politics his profession
he will have no time to fall in love."

He has done so already."

Well, you know it is easy to fall out
again."

And I," said Sybella acidly, " hope you
will find it as easy."

"When I have occasion to try, I shall,"
was the frigid answer.

At that instant a low growl from Tim's
basket in the corner gave warning of a
strange step, and in a few seconds Major

Tyler and Mr. Eawsoii were seen coming up
the garden walk.

Oil, Mabella," cried Judy, coming quickly
into the room, " Grant, the butler, said you
were out, and I have been looking for you
everywhere. Here is a note from Mrs. Horseman
; she wants us all to go to tea to-night.
Frank has got a Catherine wheel which he
wants to let off. We re to banquet on the
lawn, have a turn at lawn-tennis, a Miss
Eber is to recite, and Madame Madoc to sing.
The great beauty, too, Mrs. Beaumorris, is tone
there, and when it is quite dark  there's
no moon this quarter luckily  Frank will let
off his wheel."

"How long has Mrs. Horseman been getting
this up?" asked Sybella curtly ; " I don't like
being an after-thought."

Only since the morning," said Judy
eagerly. "I went with a message from
cousin Egbert to Mr. Horseman and found
her in a state of ferment. It had all happened
at once, she said. Frank arrived last night
with his Catherine wheel and a store of
rockets, and Miss Eber came with him ; then

there was a note from Mrs. Beaumorris,
asking herself to spend the afternoon 
they're old friends, you know  and lastly,
Madame Madoc, who has been in retirement
here, and who is also an old friend of Mrs.
Horseman, came in to say ' Good-bye.' Soon
the spot the party was improvised and I
was sent off with this note, and oh, Mabella,
you are to bring any gentleman friend you
like."

By this time Major Tyler and Mr. Eawson
had been announced, much to Tim's disgust.
Mr. Eawson Tim approved of, if in a good-humour,
obtrusively, but at no time would he
tolerate the least notice from the major, who
had learnt to keep at a respectful distance
from the fiery little animal's quarters.

Tim was, however, too well tutored to do
more than snarl and growl, and even these he
ceased at a warning word from Judy, evincing
his disquietude as he lay curled in his basket
by an occasional shiver, accompanied by a
scarcely audible whine.

At such times neither kind word from Judy
nor dainty from his mistress, Mabella, could

induce him to change his posture or look up.
For Mabella he had a very worldly affection,
only obeying her when it suited his interests.
To the rest of the family he was variably
amiable, and in their cause would show good
fight, but for Judy the little animal would
have laid down his life.

*' The only this I don't like about the
programme," said the major on Glabella
recounting the different items for the evening's
amusement, " is the recitation. Exciting is
like singing without an accompaniment, not
one in a thousand can do it. It is a social
amusement now, and a very freat social
nuisance''

I agree with Major Tyler," said Xed Lawson
; " it is all of the class of stump oratory
and ought to be voted out of society."

I wish ]\Iiss Eber heard you," said Judy.

Miss who ? " said the major with a start ;
but Judy had gone, taking with her a hastily-written
note of acceptance from Miss Egbert.

AVhat was the name Miss Aylmere mentioned
?" asked the major of the company
present ; but none seemed to have heard

distinctly, one saying Heber and another
Eden.

"Mrs. Horseman," said Mabella indifferently,
has some relation named Heber, I daresay it
was Heber."

There is a Miss Eber who recites," observed
Ned Eawson ; " she was at Cowes the
other day. I never heard her, but I was told
she was a stunner. She does it for money
though, so I should fancy she's not the same."

Ned then went to meet Judy on her return,
and Sybella with an angry glance at her
sister, who was pinning a carnation into the
major's button-hole, flung out of the room,
leaving the pair to themselves.

As the door closed the major seized Mabella's
hand and kissed it. A change had
come over him. He was no more the mysteriously
cool and haughty individual suggestive
of a Plantagenet ancestry and a " history,"
as Judy lead expressed it ; no longer either
the languid and somewhat indifferent wooer
who, though making his matrimonial inclination
pretty evident to Mabella when rare Fate
gave him unobserved opportunity, had yet

never taken a lover's licence or whispered a
lover's tale ; now he had thrown off restraint
and was going, as he said to himself, " to
make a dash at it."

Mabella's days for blushing were over, but
maiden modesty evidenced itself in a russet-red
on the plump cheeks.

*' Major Tyler," she said with a nervous
start, " sou know I am not a young girl ; "
and she drew her hand away with a jerk.

Xo, Mabella, you are not ; you are a
sensible woman in the autumn prime of life,
fresh and mellow. I hate bread-and-butter
misses ; all real men do."

Suddenly the major gave a little hop, at
best of times an undignified movement, and
caught at a small pendent hearth-brush as a
weapon of defence.

The brute," he cried, " the little vicious
brute, I believe he has bit me ; " and he ran
his unoccupied hand down the calf of his leg
keeping Tim, whose blood was thoroughly
roused, at bay with the broom. But this
Tim seized with vicious force, and a contest
ensued, more equal than dignified. Tim was

agile and in terrible earnest, primed with
long-nourished hate and jealousy ; the major
was not agile, but his blood also was up, and
he, too, was primed with hate and rage at
the untimely interruption to his dash at
fortune.

Not a sound escaped the dog's throat, but
his eyes literally shot fire, and his back was
bristled like a hog's ; he was not an enemy to
be despised. The major backed by degrees,
somewhat in the manner of a rink-sweeper
with a besom before an approaching curling-stone.
At last he fairly jumped on to a sofa,
which had its place against the wall, and still
grasping the brush with one hand, with the
other levelled down cushions at his enemy's
head. In the meantime Mabella had threatened,
exhorted, and entreated her favourite
to desist. She might as well have spoken to
the stuffed effigy of Tim's predecessor, a
rather mangy-looking poodle under a glass
cover on the top of a high bookcase. Tim
had a long score of sly kicks and pushes aid
grudges of jealousy to pay off, and as it never
occurred to him in his best of humours to

give the least heed to his mistress's orders, he
only treated her shrill commands as an additional
aggression.

But Tim had one vulnerable point, which
had more than once in similar assaults proved
a vantage-ground to the enemy ; it was
jealous and aggressive attachment to his
basket-house. Not even Judy dare have
taken him out against his will, and it was
a bold hand that laid itself on the roof. If
out walking, no matter what the distance
from home, it sufficed to say, ' I'll take your
house," when with head well down, but tail
stiffly erect, home he scudded, deaf to any
voice calling him back. Tim's domestic creed
was fixity of tenure and defiance of ejectment.


Suddenly Mabella recollected the tyrant's
master passion, and seizing the little basket-house
she held it aloft. Only one moment's
hesitation, and major, brush, and degrading
fusilade of cushions all to the winds, Tim
with a fierce growl made one vigorous leap
and gained the inside of his castle. The
suddenness of the jump nearly overbalanced

Mabella, but she recovered herself, and quick
as thought put the basket down with the door
end against the wall. This was effectual. Tim
knew he had been caught in a trap, and,
perhaps not a little ashamed of his discomfiture,
kept perfectly still, as if in contemptuous
silence ; but a peep through the open
basket-work of the roof would have shown
the little belligerent: beast sternly erect on his
hind quarters, his fore legs stiff and straight
before him, his lips curled and displaying his
testli, and his eyes two balls of fire.

Did he bite you ? " asked Mabella with
solicitude ; '* I hope not ; " and she held out
her hand to her ruffles visitor as if asking
pardon. But for his purpose in view that
plump be-ringed hand would have fared
roughly ; as it was, it was rejected, and the
major reached the ground unassisted, but he
had no desire to renew the burden of his tale ;
the steam which had propelled him to his
dash at fortune " had been rudely let off.
Not twice in the same hour could any amount
of moral propulsion generate sufficient for
another attempt. But he felt that he had cut

a poor figure, and though at the moment he
had lost all desire to recommend himself asa
lover to Mabella, he felt almost viciously
eager to vindicate his valour.

*' Xo," he said with a forced laugh, " he has
not bit me, but his intentions were good," and
he exhibited a gap at the bottom of his
trousers. '' I hope cloth does not disagree
with him ; he is probably used to it."

*'0h. Major Tyler, I am so sorry," and
Mabella looked ready to cry. " It's all Judy's
fault ; she spoils the dog. At the Hall he
really is as good as gold, and except at
tramps or bad characters he never even
growls ; it is sheer jealousy. I'll send him
back to the Hall while you  I mean, until we
return."

To this the major had no objection. His
eye had caught in the distance Judy's hat, and
before she reached the hall door he had only
time to say :

I have a mortal horror of a dois's bite.
My only brother died of hydrophobia  a pet
spaniel of my sister bit him. None of us
have owned a dog since."

Then shrinking from hearing his ignominious
affray expatiated on before Judy, he
bade Mabella a hasty good-bye, giving her
hand, however, a fervent squeeze  a palliative,
soothing and magnanimous one. Much comforted,
Mabella forbore to recount Tim's
misdemeanour, which she, unknown to herself,
considered almost justifiable on the ground of
the dog's jealous attachment to herself. That
she did so may be received as indicative that
the major had made only surface way as yet
in her affections  that her vanity rather than
her heart had been touched.

Love gilds the scene, and woman guides the plot."

The pleasantness parties given in Sandycot were
given by Mrs. Horseman, who, tliougli herself
of an old territorial family, had mixed too freely
in continental and metropolitan society to retain
much of the prohibitive element of narrow
county circles. As would naturally happen,
people got "mixed up"' a little at times, and
shoulders rubbed that in other assemblies had
diverged with the cold edge pointed towards
each other. But Sandycot forgave Mrs. Horseman
all infringements of the social code ; she
was the life and soul of the place in vivacity,
good-nature, hospitality and wealth, and being
in herself  that is, in her birth and breeding 
all that the strictest social guild could require,
she was in a manner privileged.

Mr. Horseman had been in parliament and
distinguished by his enthusiasm in agricultural

questions : ill health had driven him to the
Chiltern Hundreds.

There were children of this favoured household,
but in nursery and school durance still.

In a charming demi toilette Mrs. Horseman satin
a basket-chair, sipping an afternoon cup of
tea ; her husband, comfortably ensconced in a
pillows lounge, followed her example, but was
greatly absorbed in the Times, which had just
arrived; and in the window, a little drawn
back from the balcony, sat Mrs. Beaumorris, of
whose advent Judy had apprised her cousins.

The public in general were very familiar
with Mrs. Beau morris's features, and in attitude
she had exhausted every pose consistent with
modesty. Seated as she now was in the decline
of the day's vivid light, the mellow hue of a
golden sunset tinging her somewhat pale cheek,
a fairer woman had never graced this little seaside
retreat of Sandycot. Severe simplicity
characterized her costume, which, however,
was strictly in accordance with the fashion of
the day. Her eyes were large and deer-like,
and she had a trick of opening them suddenly
to their full extent with a startled innocent

look, then, as if quickly reassured, she would
slowly droop the lids and with languishing
softness close them over the now filmy orbs.
Many a quarry had this wingless shaft laid
low. As to her domestic circumstances, she
was happily married  that is, she and her husband
saw as much and as little of each other
as they wished. Neither was over-burdened
with brains ; both loved pleasure, which they
took in different ways ; there were no children,
and Mr. Beaumorris's means were ample. The
love that had brought them together was still
strong enough to keep them in a loose fashion
together, but to the husband the wife had long
ceased to be a beauty, and to the wife the
husband had long been little more than a
convenient and not disagreeable household
appendage.

I don't believe Mrs. Beaumorris has love
or liking? for a human beings," said Mr. Horseman
to his wife on one occasion, " or vitality
enough to conceive iniquity. I hate lukewarm
women ; the virtue that is above temptation
is beneath contempt."

Much you know about it," was his wife's

VOL. I. 4

reply, nodding her comely head knowingly.
Creamy Beaumorris is no fool. If she had
an affair no one would suspect it who did not
know her, and no one does know her as I do,
and I can assure you my friend Creamy can
be vicious. She is jealous of her empire of
beauty, and she hates distraction. She is
clever enough to know she is not clever, and I
know she fears and hates a clever pretty woman
as you hate a Tennessee farmer."

' How ever came it then," asked Mr. Horseman,
laughing, " that she even tolerated you ? ''

*' Because, dear," she replied simply, " I only
cared to be beautiful to you, and any little
talent I have is at everybody's service. Creamy
will want a friend some day, or I mistake, and
you know I am quixotic."

To-day Creamy (the diminutive for Cremona,
the fanciful baptismal name given Mrs. Beau-morris
by her violin-loving father) was more
than usually languid and indifferent.

I suppose you won't dance ? " she said, in
relation to the approaching party.

No," replied Mrs. Horseman, " lawn-tennis
will be attraction enough till dark ; then we

shall have you as centre-piece ; Madame Madoc
will sing ; a Miss Eber will recite ; the sky
will be ablaze with stars. A professional
beauty, singer, and reciter ; I ought to be
proud."

You haven't many here, have you ? "

Oh, yes ; Major Tyler is a host in himself,
and young Mr. Eawson is audaciously amusing.
I hear Major Tyler and Miss Egbert are
enaeed."

What, old Miss Egbert ? Why, she is sixty
if she is a day, and he is certainly under
forty."

Oh, you know Major Tyler ; we are all so
curious about him. But poor Miss Egbert has
not sinned much beyond fifty, and Major Tyler
looks to have lived quite forty."

I only know him, as I know a score of
others, by meeting him in society. He is
very handsome."

Nobody seems to know anything more of
him, and though he is very comme il faut and
agreeable I can't say I feel attracted towards
him."

Alio will Egbert Hall go to ? "asked Mrs.

42

 ttUNOIS

Beaumorris. " I am told there is no male heir
and that the entail expires with the present
squire."

To the daughters of course in the first
place, after them all is conjecture. The
Egbertss are singularly devoid of relations ;
pretty little Judy Aylmere is, I believe, the
nearest. Her great-grandmother was an
Egbert and collaterally related to the present
family. The squire is very fond of her."

"I wonder Major Tyler did not try his
chance with youth first ; he used to be a
worshipper of beauty, and you say the young
lady is pretty."

"Yes, sweetly pretty, but quite a sylvan
flower, brimful of fun, shrewd and outspoken."


Mrs. Beaumorris was naturally reticent ;
she hazarded no further remark.

I'll tell you what," said Mr. Horseman,
looking up from his paper; "the major is wise
in his generation. Mabella Egbert is certain,
if she outlives her father, to hold the place
for the remainder of her natural life, and the
squire is breaking rapidly. The major knows

this, and if one can believe club gossip the
fortune might come too late for his necessities."

The arrival of Miss Eber turned the conversation
into another channel ; Mr. Horseman
took his newspaper into another room.

Miss Eber was small and dark, insignificant
to the casual observer, but an observant eye
that looked once would look twice and not
readily forget what it saw in the sensitive
colourless face, which seemed to shrink from,
rather than court, the notice which the reputation
of her histrionic gift attracted. Only
to the eye of no speculation was Elsie Eber
insignificant. Her dress, never in slavish
conformity to the fashion of the day, was as
individual as herself. It was always black,
flowers only supplying colour.

Mrs. Beaumorris, innately conventional,
relaxed under the influence of Elsie's unobtrusive
but gentle assumption of equality ;
she knew of old that in society self-assertion
was necessary. Behind the " professional,"
and beneath that quiet demeanour, there
might be both birth and connection. There
was refinement enough for the presumption,

SO Mrs. Beaumorris argued mentally ; in any
case there was no end to be served by reserve
or hauteur, and if " dear Mrs. Horseman was a
little Bohemian in lier proclivities she was,
however, indisputably within the very inner
ring of exclusive society, and if she did take a
little latitude in her choice of associates she
was the most unlikely of any one to make a
mistake." That she had taken slightly risky
liberties with society was well known, but.
never one that was not defensible in itself.

Mrs. Beaumorris had what is closely akin
to an intellectual gift, she had tact, and that-tact
led her to avoid allusion on this her first
introduction to Miss Eber to that lady's semi-professional
calling ; she even avoided the
subject of poetry or literature in any form.

"Well, Elsie," said Mrs. Horseman, 'you
have had a long walk ; what do you think of
Sandycot, and was Frank attentive to you . "

Devotedly so," and Elsie smiled. " Frank
is an arrant little flirt in embryo. As for
Sandycot, the one only term that describes it
is ' model.' Sandycot is model from the top of
its cliffs to the level of its sands. Look down

on the white decorous town from the highest
diff, and not a romantic memory will bestirred,
for there are none to stir ; or look up
at the cliffs from, say, this sweet amphibious
eyrie, and not a line of poetry will suggest
itself to you."

That is its charm," said Mrs. Beaumorris
languidly ; ' even aspiration can rest ; it only
wants one thing to make it perfect."

Ah," returned Elsie with what might be
either satire or flattery, and with professional
pose and tone 

'I have no men to govern in this wood,
That makes my only woe.' "

Creamy gave an indifferent shrug of her
lovely shoulders.

Oh, no, not a woe, a charm," she said,
smiling. " My roc's egg is a harbourage for a
yacht ; there is none here, the water is too
shallow at fullest. One can never feel the full
force of solitude on shore."

"I don't know about the full force,
Creamy," said Mrs. Horseman slyly, "but I
do know the full need of solitude at sea ; there

man delights me not, nor woman neither.*
One of the greatest charms of this little seaside
nook to me is the very one thing that fails to
make it perfection to you  its shallow waters.
The very sight of a ship at anchor, rising and
falling with the ceaseless motion of the water,
never still on the stillest day, gives me very
unromantic qualms. Just fix your eye on the
point of a mast in a dead calm, and you will
see it describing swaying gyrations in mid-air
against the blue ethereal. If you are nota
good sailor, as the stock phrase is, that blue
will soon change to green, and you will feel
inclined to lie down."

Elsie laughed. " I love the sea," she said.
I agree with Mrs. Beaumorris, there is no
place like it for abstraction. I can study
best at sea, and, if my piece is suitable, in a
storm."

It is a capricious monster," returned Mrs.
Horseman, "full of invidious favouritism.
Two greater opposites than you and Creamy
could not be, and it loves you both."

Oh, we're not friends in a storm," said
Cream, " we're fair-weather friends. I cultivate

a tranquil spirit ; there is no tumult in
my nature."

The very secret of preserving beauty,
according to Ninon de I'Enclos," laughed
Elsie.

Oh, Creamy," said Mrs. Horseman half in
earnest, " a tranquil spirit is often another
name for a cold heart. But it is nearly seven ;
if you have any finishing touches to put to
your toilette you have only ten minutes."

A heart is like silver plate, dear Mrs.
Horseman," answered Creamy as she swept
from the room, "too risky for a small menage.
Electro is an excellent substitute."

"And you," whispered Elsie to herself as
she flitted after her, " you hall-mark yours."

The table at which was served the heterogeneous
meal known as severe tea was a
perfect parterre of flowers, among which
nestled bonbons and fruit. The more material
needs of the company were supplied by
servants from a bountiful bullet. In the
centre was a magnificent azalea, the winner
of the first prize at an adjacent flower-show
of the previous week. The adjustment

of all the other flowers was low, so as not to
obscure a vis-a-vis.

By some unpremeditated arrangement Judy
was brought m by Major Tyler, and Elsie by
Ned Eawson, who seated his charge at one side
of the table facing the azalea, while Judy in
enthusiastic admiration of the plant placed
herself exactly opposite Elsie, the major
obediently filling the chair by her side.

To Judy, who, never guilty of mauvaise honte,
was yet apt to be affected by disturbing circumstances
which would scarcely be felt, or at
any rate evidenced, by a girl used much to
general society. Major Tyler was an element
of this quality. She shrank from the individual
with yet scarcely pronounced dislike,
but the notice of the man flattered her. Her
heart beat fast when he bent down on her his
eloquent gaze, so vocal with repressed admiration,
but not one throb was love's. He
talked well, and she loved to listen, and somehow
to him she was not averse from letting
her ignorance on the graver subjects of everyday
converse appear ; he seemed to think it
natural, if not actually seemly, that she should

bracket politics with algebra, and ask, as she
once did, if the budget was kept in the woolsack.
He had the art of imparting knowledge
as if he were in some degree receiving it likewise.
Already she knew the different functions
of government and the broad principles of
opposing parties. Hers was no frivolous
nature; this the major early divined, and
whenever opportunity offered he gave her the
instruction she indirectly asked for.

Judy was grateful and perhaps a little overrated
her instructor's gifts. She had begun
by calling and believing him a fortune-hunter ;
now she seemed to find excuses for him, which
in reality were excuses for her own increasing
liking for him.

Men are not always what they seem," he
said one day when, returning from a saunter
in the garden with Mabella, he found Judy
alone in the drawing-room, and he had been
received with a rather contemptuous bow.
Some day I should like to tell you the
history of my life. It is difficult to take back
a false move."

He has compromised himself with Mabella,"

thought Judy. "More's the pity for
both," and then she dismissed him from her
thoughts, not, however, with acerbity.

But her relations with Ned Eawson were
more complicated.

You are not half as clever as Major Tyler,"
she once said petulantly to the young man,
but only once, for at his quiet answer to her
invidious depreciation, and the somewhat
humorous look in his deep grey eyes, a
quick-winged thought crossed her brain, that
perhaps she had mistaken lacquer for gold.

** I should not like to be thought clever,"
he said, " when I have yet so much to learn ;
a clever man is one who knows things intuitively
; Major Tyler does."

I didn't mean that he was a born genius.
I daresay I shouldn't know a genius if I met
one," and she pouted ; " only he always knows
the reason of everything I ask him, and he
never laughs at me."

Perhaps he has a reason for that, too," the
young man replied, whether in earnest or
not Judy could not telli She flushed angrily.

Thank you, Mr. Eawson," she said, " that's

as much as to say that I am ridiculous. But I
tell you what, if I am, he must know it ' intuitively,'
for whatever I may have done to
you, ' most grave and learned seigneur,' I
never made myself ridiculous to him  there
now."

' Oh, Judy, what a rocket you are ; off
you go, without i match even. As if you
could ever be anything to me but the sweetest,

lovely " But Xed was not destined to

hurry on his fate. He was left with his half-finished
avowal, looking not a little foolish,
Judy calling back to him over her shoulder
as she flitted away, laughing merrily, " If I
am the rocket, I wonder who's the stick."

Beneath the luxuriant azalea Judy recognized
her vis-a-vis. To that circumstance
Major Tyler owed the sweet smile she bestowed
on him as she said, loud enough to be
heard across the table, " We can talk better
in the shade."

It is the azalea that is in the shade," he
whispered.

Nothing irritated Judy so much as compliments,
except from a favoured few. She

looked upon them in the light of liberties.
Now remembering Ned's irritating innuendo
she thought, " He is ridiculing me," and
espying Mabella, who had been delayed by
some toilet mishap, coming into the room
escorted by young Horseman, she said quickly
and with latent mischief, " Oh, Major Tyler,
there is Miss Egbert. Is there no seat reserved
for her ? She had better have mine."

But room was made beside the major, who
with much empressement stood back until
Mabella had subsided into her chair. As he
resumed his seat Judy with a mock dispirited
look whispered, " I know who's in the shade
now."

There was no answer. She turned her
eyes on his face inquiringly. It was pale to
ghastliness. Ordinarily there was no colour
to come and go, but a steady bronze, which
told of foreign climes and a fervid sun ; one
does not look on such a visage for varying
hues of every-day manly cheeks. But it was
the sudden pallor only that betrayed the
sudden emotion ; not a nerve quivered, nor
did the eyes quail. He knew by Judy's start

as lie turned to him that her quick eyes
noticed the pallor. " Do not observe me," he
said quietly ; " an old enemy, spasm in the
heart."

Mabella's vinaigrette," she whispered,
turning her face aside. He understood, and
with a spark of real gratitude he bent forward
and lifted unobserved a massive gold vinaigrette,
pungently charged, lying at arabella's
ricrht hand. It had the desired effect.

"I could not resist it," he said as she
looked round inquiringly. " The perfume of
these flowers is overpowering. I was quite
overcome. Incense used to make me faint."

Oil," said Mabella tenderly, " a sensitive
organization."

But on the opposite side of the table, shaded
also by the specious azalea, was another face
over which a death-like pallor had spread.
Those cheeks, too. owned no roseate bloom
to flush and fade ; what colouring there was,
lay veiled beneath the delicate olive of the
transparent skin. Judy, not to embarrass her
companion by even a quiet observance, had
leant her head a little sideways to reconnoitre

her vis-a-vis. Catching Ned's eye she smiled, 
and then looked at his companion. Ned,
noticing her countenance change, followed
the direction of her eyes.

"Did you speak?" said Elsie, meeting his
startled gaze with perfect self-possession, but
her voice had a hollow sound.

Are you ill ? " he asked.

No ; why ? " was the reply as she bent
forward and looked into the mirrored plateau
which ran down the centre of the table. " Ah,
I am pale ; that is it, I suppose," and then
taking the tiny bouquet which had fallen to
her share, she picked out a spray of stephanotis
and threw it to the ground, adding,
"That flower always has a strange effect
on me ; another moment and I should have
fainted. Hush," putting her hand on his
arm, which was stretched towards a tiny
decanter of wine, " please don't make a fuss ;
I shall be myself in a few minutes."

Ned obeyed.

These little scenes on either side of the
table had passed in the space of two minutes,
unobserved by all those around.

The business of the feast went on uninterruptedly.
Jest and badinage, repartee and
gay sail', with low rippling laughter, platitude
and fustian, sentiment and bathos, gossip
and innuendo, flowed from the full vein of the
moment, each in its turn index of individual
cast. But neither flash of wit nor piquant
tale, nor the generous wine and viands of
which both partook, chased from Geoffrey
Tyler's face that night its pallid hue, nor
restored to Elsie Eber's olive cheek its rich
undergo of colour. And Judy Aylmere
had taken notes.

VOL. I.

The leaves of memory seemed to make
A mournful rustling in the dark."

The night was sultry and the stars dim.
Lawn-tennis fell flat, and at Mrs. Horseman's
suggestion a walk to the pier, distant about a
quarter of a mile, was carried with acclaim.
As Judy passed through the hall in search of
a wrap she saw Major Tyler writing hurriedly
on a scrap of paper, which he folded and
placed in his waistcoat pocket.

I am waiting for Mrs. Beaumorris," he
said as Judy approached ; " Mrs. Horseman
has placed her under my care. Will you join
us?"

"Oh, no," cried Judy, not staying one
instant, and looking back to finish her sentence,
"you mustn't be greedy; one beauty at
a time."

Mayn't I choose then ? " he called after
her, but she had disappeared.

He went to the open door, and in a short
space of time Mrs. Beaumorris joined him.

Life is full of surprises," she said, declining
his proffered arm as she languidly moved
towards the pier. "Do you know you gave
me the first supernatural sensation I ever
had ? "

'' I ! " he returned in a tone of indifferent
banter. " I, so matter-of-fact and realistic,
so thoroughly of the earth, earthy ! "

I won't contradict you," she replied carelessly,
" but I approve of worldly people ;
they can look after their own interests, and
generally succeed. They entail as little as
they carry responsibility."

Creamy," he whispered, looking down on
her with warm reproachful eyes, " how
bitter you are ; it was your own fault."

What was my own fault ? " she answered,
meeting his gaze with a wide-eyed look of
wonder, cool and contemptuous.

The major bit his moustache.

"That we parted when we did and as we
did," he replied hotly.

Parted ! " she repeated with a low mocking

laugh. "It is only friends and enemies
who part ; casual acquaintances pass on, and
that, I think, we did."

I understand," he said, his lip curing ;
but, lady fair, remember this : love's golden
chain is strong ; its links, though dropped, are
never lost ; sweet lips pressed, soft hands
clasped, warm looks mingled, and fond words
spoken  these do not pass on."

No," she said significantly, " they remain
stationary."

As she spoke the entrance to the pier was
reached, where they were joined by Judy,
Miss Eber, and Ned Rawson.

"I was just telling Major Tyler," said Mrs.
Beau morris, addressing Elsie, " that he has
given me the only supernatural sensation I
ever experienced. I had heard he had gone
to Africa exploring, and that he had been
murdered, or drowned, or something of the
sort, and here, in this little out-of-the-way
nook, he appears in the flesh. I have had to
pace him through a crucial catechism to establish
his identity. I shall call him Pepper's
ghost, I think."

What an unkind reflections'' said Judy.

They all laughed.

"Shall I introduce you?" whispered Mrs.
Beaumorris to Elsie ; and without waiting for
an answer she did so.

"I think we have met before," said Major
Tyler as he bowed without looking up.

"I did not know that you were in England,"
she replied, drawing her veil down, but only
Judy noticed the white quivering lips.

The party then in straggling order proceeded
up the pier, where Frank Horseman
was preparing to " turn off," as he expressed
it, his Catherine wheel. In the applause that
followed the boy's successful venture, Judy
noticed Major Tyler, inadvertently as it were,
approach Elsie, who was standing apart by
herself, very quiet and abstracted. The only
sign she gave that she even saw the brilliant
'Scintilla was a start at the acclamation that
followed, and a few feeble claps of her hands ;
but a close observer, which Judy was, could
see that the action was mechanical. Quietly
as the major moved, Elsie felt his approach.
She drew her wrap closer round her neck.

sinking the lower part of her face in its
folds, and steadied herself to statue-like
stillness.

You have dropped something," he said
as he stooped down by her side ; then
straightening himself he gave her a piece
of paper, which she received without remark.

Judy, fascinated, fixed her eyes on Elsie's
face, which by the light of the gas lamps she
could see distinctly.

"I wait your answer," he whispered, and
as if constrained Elsie opened the paper and
read it.

Very well," she said in a harsh sharp
voice, " I will."

He did not move.

With an impatient gesture, as one in pain,
she raised her hand and turned the palm
towards him.

Elsie "

 " Silence ! " she said in a low hollow tone,
with an outward motion of her hand.

 Then without a look, but with a dignity
that seemed to Judy's eyes to make her tower
above the, what she read to be, deprecatory

figure before her, she gilded away and slipped
her hand into Mrs. Horseman's arm.

Why, Elsie, you are tired," said Mrs.
Horseman ; " I forgot your journey today."


Madame Madoc had sung her splendid best,
Judy had warbled her sweetest of ballads,
and Mrs. Beaumorris had graciously posed and
languished from various coigns of vantage, to
the utter bewitchment of the Sandycot contingent,
before Mrs. Horseman approached
Elsie, who was seated in a quiet corner talking
at intervals to Mr. Eawson, whose observations
were regulated in their pertinency by
Judy's movements.

Are you rested enough to give us something,
dear ? " she asked, taking her friend's
hand in hers ; " something simple, something
that won't tax you much."

Elsie rose instantly, gently smiling compliance.


That is the great reciter Miss Eber,"
whispered Mr. Green, one of the Sandycot
curates.

What, that little atom ? " returned Miss

Prance, a tall stout female, with a remarkably
curved neck.

"Little!" exclaimed Miss Turner, a slight
spiral girl who affected mind ; " why, she is
great, grand ! Look at her eyes ; they lift
her off the ground. Call her little ! "

"There certainly is something about Miss
Eber," timidly observed Mr. Green, " that
gives one the idea of loftiness."

Maybe so," and Miss Prance sneered ;
but I am afraid I am distressingly matter-of-fact.
I don't mind betting you  in gloves
of course  that she is not one inch over five
foot two."

Measured by vulgar flesh," said the spiral
young lady, twisting round and fixing her
eyes for a moment with vicious point on Miss
Prance's lavish award of that substance, "I
doubt if she is even that ; by her soul she
soars above inches."

Mr. Green had a keen sense, if not of
actual humour, yet of the ridiculous, and he
laughed. Miss Prance arched her neck with
a forward jerk of the chin, and put out her
foot with the action of a horse pawing ; she

evidently meant mischief. But suddenly
attracted by some swift movements at the
upper end of the room, she and her companions
turned round, and in the deep embrasure
of the window, beneath the lace curtain's
snowy arch, they saw the subject of their discussion
standing forward and alone. Some of
the lights in various parts of the room had
been extinguished, others moved forward, and
on either side of the slight figure, whose attitude
and calm upward look told of concentrated
and conscious power, a silver lamp
with painted shade and deep pink fringe
had been placed. Her dress was of some
light material, soft and sheeny, with a partial
train. She stood, her slight hand poised like a
white butterfly on the fragrant flowers on her
breast.

The piece chosen was Tennyson's " Victim."
Her voice, almost tremulous at first, swelled
into fuller volume as she proceeded, till it
seemed to fill the silenced chamber with a
pervading and most musical cadence. There
was little of action in the recital, which owed
its force to the marvellous voice and yet

more marvellous eyes, " which filled with
light the interval of sound."

When she had finished she slipped out to
the balcony and joined Mr. Horseman, who
was indulging in a mild cigarette.

The poet touched a subtle truth, friend
Elsie," he said ; " a woman loves her child
deeper than her husband."

Because she died to save her child," and
Elsie turned her pale face to her companion.
blind of heart and slow to understand all
that woman has shown you, had she had to
choose between husband and son for a victim,
with her own hands she would have offered
the son. A woman may have many sons of
her youth, but only one husband. It was the
sublimity of vicarious love, she never thought
of self."

There are a good many exceptions to your
transcendental rule," returned Mr. Horseman,
not taking the slight cigarette from his lips.

"I always avoid the exceptions," she
answered with a sly smile as she made way
for Mrs. Beau morris.

'' I have been avowing a heresy, according

to Miss Eber," said Mr. Horseman, addressing
the newcomer. " I say that a woman loves
her child above her husband. What say

you?"

I was never good at puzzles"' she answered
languidly ; " the sort of love one sees on the
stage is very exhausting ; life is too short for
anything stronger than affection ; very strong
emotions are vulgar, but I suppose if it ever
did come to a question of choice, which is
not likely in real life, the child would carry
the day."

Ignoring the offensive points of this speech
Elsie said, " We are three presumptuous persons,
answering a question out of our power
to determine. I have no husband, Mrs. Beau-morris
no child, and Mr. Horseman is nota
woman."

My experience as a legislator taught me,"
said that gentleman, " that abstract questions
were always best answered by those who
knew least about the matter in practice. The
finest speech I almost ever listened to was on
patriotism by an Irish member of the government,
whose boast it was that he had not set

foot in this native country for twenty years,
and yet he drew a large income from his
estates there."

Not a case in point," said Elsie ; " the
sister-kingdoms are so nearly allied, a man
simply born in Ireland, but reared in England,
and solely by English people, may be
excused for haziness about his nationality, or,
I should say, for running one into the other,
as it were."

I can forgive an Irishman trying to get rid
of his nationality," observed Mrs. Beaumorris.

An Irishman who does that," said Ned
Eawson, who had joined the little group unnoticed;
" and who claims adventitiously English
habitat and citizenship, is a state foundling."

'* He never can shake off race," said Elsie ;
that is, presuming he is not a mongrel, and
even then the characteristics of his combination
will cleave to him with irradicable
pertinency. It is said that hybrids inherit the
most distinctive evil qualities of their parents."

I hope my parents were not very wicked,"
laughed Ned, " for my mother was Irish."

The House "  Mr. Horseman always called

Parliament " the House "  " would be very
flat without the Irish element," he said.

There have been some grand Irishmen in
Parliament," observed Ned.

Yes, orators, propagandists, and patriots,
too, proud of their nationality ; but," and Mr.
Horseman, as if to give force to his words,
threw away his half-finished cigarette with
a conclusive gesture, " but not one statesman."


Castlereagh ! " exclaimed. Xed.

No statesman, and no Irishman in the
sense of race."

Palmerston," put in Mrs. Beaumorris," was
an Irish peer."

'- Palmerston ! " said Mr. Horseman ; " a
thorough Englishman in blood, in every attribute
a representative Englishman in fact.
The Temples were Saxon earls before the
Conquest."

I think," said Elsie, who had a quiet way
of putting things that suggested knowledge
and authority, " I think Sir Charles Dike in
his ' Greater Britain ' was right, and that the
soil has much to do with race. He says that

the white race who have taken the place of
the aborigines in America are gradually also
taking their physical type, and that he believes
in course of time they will become Need
Indians."

Xow, Miss Eber, " exclaimed Mrs. Beau-morris,
posing so as to display her liberal
charms with anything but oriental reserve,
do you mean to tell me that even cycles of
Cathay could have made me a Chinese ? "

You are a ' celestial ' nevertheless," said
Mr. Horseman with an admiring bow.

They might have made you a Tartar,"
said Judy, who had come on the scene unobserved.
Every one laughed, even the beauty
smiled, but she was not to be so silenced.

And what should cycles of Cathay have
done for you? " she asked of Elsie still.

What cycles of every land but our own
have done," she answered proudly, " left us as
we were."

And that was, what ? "

The words tripped from Mrs. Beau morris's
lips airily, but incisively ; insolently', Judy
thought.

Jews ! " was the answer given in a voice of
proud disdain.

Oh ! " and Mrs. Beaumorris opened her
eyes as if disagreeably surprised, and then,
apparently disgusted with the subject, she
returned to the drawing-room.

Did you notice," whispered Ned to Judy,
she wanted to make Elsie, in accordance with
her own theory, ' a squalid savage ? ' Oh,
Judy, I am so glad you are not a 'real
beauty,' you'd have been so vicious."

I wonder who gave you leave to call me
Judy," she answered. "I've come out now,
and I must say you're not very gallant."

There was a pout in the sweet mouth, but
arch fun in the eyes.

I mean beauty by patent, you know,"
apologized Ned. " I hate beauties, and husbands
get so tired of them."

How odd ! " she said. " Now I dote on
handsome men, particularly when over thirty
and dark. They remind me of the old
Paladins and Crusaders and chevaliers.
Don't you think Major Tyler singularly handsome?
"

She spoke with a little gush ; Ned could
see it was put on.

Singularly so," lie replied gravely ; " but
wives get so tired of handsome husbands."

Then what a faithful wife you'll have,
Ned," she whispered, and tripped ois to Mr.
Horseman's side.

Oh, no, Mr. Horseman," Elsie was saying,
I only adopt Sir Charles's theory in part.
Each is race to the end of time ; but I think
the physical characteristics may undergo some
sort of transmutation in course of generations.
The surroundings, traditions, habit of eye,
atmosphere, food, all must insensibly mould,
as they moulded before, upon a certain model,
how given or conceived, who can tell ? "

Well," said Mr. Horseman, " your theory
would account for the seeming change in the
Saxon characteristics of families who are now
thoroughly Irish  modern Irish  in temperament
as well as physique. In this way Lord
Palmerston received his airy lightness of disposition,
his espihjlerie in fact ; in all else he
was English."

Yes," said Judy, who had always something

to say on every discussion, " and naturally
so, for not so very long ago it was the
custom of the Irish gentry to give out their
children to the peasants to nurse, not taking
them back till they were two or three years
old, just as they do still in France. I remember
uncle John, mamma's uncle  he was a navy
surgeon  telling me that he had been given
out to nurse in that way in Tipperary ; his
father was Irish, and I always used to think
him so like a fine mealy potato, a regular
smiler,' always at hand, happy-go-lucky,
good-natured and homely, and I know he was
very fond of whisky."

That is conclusive," cried both Mr.
Horseman and Elsie, returning to the drawings
the latter adding, " I think Miss
Aylmere not very un-Irish herself in some of
these qualities, barring the whisky of course,"
and the latter smiled at Judy, one of her rare
sweet smiles. Judy's heart was won from
that moment, and for a wonder she had not a
read)' answer.

Whispering a hasty good-night to Mrs.
Horseman on the score of fatigue, Elsie

VOL. I. 6

glided almost unobserved out of the room by
a side door, but, stopping an instant to disengage
her skirt, which had caught in the
legs of an ornamented table, she overheard a
woman's voice, which to her ear sounded a
little querulous, say, " I'm very downright
myself, major, and I like my friends to bethe
same."

Quickly came the reply, and scarcely
knowing she did so Elsie turned her head to
the side from which the voices came, and held
the handle of the door a second before she
turned it. She could see no one, but a lace
curtain shading a window-nook moved.

Well she knew the voice.

"Downright! Free-spoken, you mean," said
the major in a low melancholy tone ; "' that, except
to a chosen few "  a pause  " I cannot be.
I have often wished to tell you the story of my
life ; some day I will, for I know you will not
judge me harshly. Oh, Mabella, oily to find
one faithful trusting breast on which to lay
my weary head."

The door was opened, as if by sudden
impulse ; it closed of itself with a slam, which

startled the occupants of the window-nook and
made the " weary head " turn with a lively
motion and reconnoitre suspiciously. At the
same instant Mabella with a little shame-faced
womanly dignity issued from her retreat,
saying aloud, " We must be going ; I wonder
where Mrs. Horseman is."

There was another sharp slam, of a distant
door, an unusual sound in that refined and
perfectly ordered house, but it reached, or
seemed to reach, only one ear, for the company
where one and all making their adieux with the
usual rustle and flying phrases and preoccupation.


That ear was Major Tyler's.

Then Seapinks hospitable doors closed, and
the inmates retired to rest.

The night was very still and sultry, and the
windows of the sleeping apartments were open
to their utmost. It was the custom of Mrs.
Horseman to steal from this quiet interlude
of her busy life one " precious hour," as she
called it, for solitary reading or study. The
charm of a quiet, unbroken by the sound of
a human voice or foot, or the lazy stir of

62

Sandycot's leisurely traffic, the muffled music
of the rippling tide stealing in on the blank
sands, and the slow chime of the church clock,
quickened thought and fancy, while it filled
the senses with an unutterable calm. To-night
in her little sanctum, as she termed the tiny
boudoir leading out of her bedroom, she sat,
but with neither book nor pen in her hand,
only a small lunar telescope with which she
almost idly swept the heavens, now and again
resting on a star.

There was not a planet whose name and
earth history she did not know, on whose
habitat she could not at once turn her lens.
They were her panacea for the distractions of
the day,

The words of God, the scriptures of the sky."

But to-night her panacea failed her. She
could not feel the sweet influence of the
Pleads ; " she could only see that they were
*' tangled in a silver braid." There was
unrest in her spirit. The friend of all friends
she held dearest, most akin to her deeper
nature, Elsie Eber, vexed and troubled her.

for she divined by lier rare sympathy that Elsie
had a great sorrow, passion, care, or what it
might be, she could not or would not share
with her. For a little that thought pained
her, but her nature was too large for narrow
judgments, the spirit of her friendship too
pure for one unworthy suspicion or even the
shadow of a doubt. It was her keen sensitiveness,
with no taint of jealousy, that suffered;
her friend's hopes and fears she claimed for
her own. Keenly she thought over every
incident connected with Elsie that had come-under
even her passing notice that evening,,
till at last, faintly as the first gleam of a
slow dawn, a light rose on her mental vision
Elsie is standing apart in the gay assemblage,
coldly regardful of strangers, as is her
wont. She turns constrainedly as Major
Tyler addresses her, not before, and takes
with a frigid bow a scrap of paper from his
hand. She does not even look at it till,
apparently obedient to his lowly-uttered request,
she indifferently opens and reads.

Mrs. Horseman remembers how she watched
this incident with a sort of quiescent curiosity,

attaching to it at the time no undue meaning,
scarcely thinking it had a meaning. She remembered,
though, being struck with the
glowing splendour of the girl's ejes and the
more than usual olive clearness of her face.

Then Elsie, to again a whispered request
from her companion, utters some cold words
and turns away, tearing the piece of paper
into atoms.

She called to mind, too, that she had
glanced at Major Tyler's face, and that she
had fancied, smiling at her fancy, that there
was a craven scare in his eyes.

There has been more than mere acquaintance
between these two," she said to herself.
I do not trust that man."

Again and again she passed each point of
this incident before her mind's eye, till once
more it became indistinct and indefinite, in
some such way as a dimly-seen star in the far
offing gleams and fades, and fades and gleams,
till it seems to vanish into nothingness.

The gas-lights were still lit on the pier,
which stretched out in a direct line from Mrs.
Horseman's point of observation, so that by

aid of her telescope she could command it to
its very end. The night, too, was clear if
sultry, for though the newly-risen moon was
yet in her first quarter the heavens were
ablaze With " clear tapers without number."

In disquietude of spirit Mrs. Horseman rose
to retire for the nio-jit. For a minute she
stood gazing at the pier with thoughts far
away.

It was not unusual for smokers, when the
tide was full, to linger till the small hours at
the extreme end, strolling leisurely up and
down, or lounging dreamily over the rails ;
but to-night the tide was still in the far distance,
and at such times the pier was generally
deserted. As if to say good-night to the
placid scene she raised her telescope and
levelled it at the pier. The next minute she
threw herself into her low chair and covered
her face with her hands.

"Oh, Elsie," she said aloud, "you might
have trusted me."

Then, without even a glance outward, she
half closed the window and retired to bed ;
but not one unworthy thought of her friend

entered her leal heart, not a shadow of distrust,
not a jot or tittle of disapproval. Now
that she had discovered what was not meant
for her to know, she would not speculate
again on Elsie's relation to Major Tyler ; to
have done so would have seemed prying, if
not dishonourable, and as she laid her head on
her pillow she whispered to herself, " She will
tell me all in her own good time."

Sleep, though she wooed it, did not come
soon. Unknown to herself her ear waited for
perhaps a light foot on the stair, or in the
room overhead, which was Elsie's, some gentle
movements ; and long before her lids were
lieav} so acute had been her unconscious
watch, she heard a light trailing sound like a
soft breeze on the floor above ; backwards and
forwards it passed.

Poor soul, she is pacing up and down and
suffering," she thought, and then she fell
asleep ; but the stars were dimming in the
faint dawn of day before the soft sweeping
motion of Elsie's honos trailing skirt ceased.

"You pledged me your word when we

parted that you would never judge me unheard.
In the name of that pledge I ask you
to meet me to-night at twelve, when all is
quiet, at the end of the pier.

Geoffrey."

These were the words written on the scrap
of paper which drew Elsie Eber from her
friend's house at dead of night to meet the
man whom only yesterday she would have
sought the furthest quarter of the globe to
avoid.

Sife- <-j4

And the-vvreck'd heart lies cold."

'' Ix the smallest iota I never swerved from a
promise," lie said to herself as lie spoke the
cold words of assent, " and I will redeem this
bitter pledge now."

He was leaning over the rails at the furthest
end of the pier, smoking a cigar ; he did not
hear her light tread till she was close behind
hun, then he turned round, throwing his
cigar away, but paused for a moment, hesitating
how he should greet her.

A laisse black lace shawl was all the covering
she wore over her evening dress, which
she had stripped of the flowers on breast
and arms. A black lace kerchief on her head
was tied under her chin, its peak resting on
her arched brow.

'' I am here to redeem my pledge," she
said clearly and coldly, a world of pent-up
pain and pride in her great lustrous eyes, of
scathing contempt on her curved lip.

A minute before he thought he had his tale
by heart; a moving, tragic, pleading tale, that
could not fail, he deemed, to quicken again
the principle of love, which, once implanted ina
woman's heart  so his rallying belief ran 
could never, but with lier life, be wholly extinguished
; but now not a word of the specious
fable could his lips utter ; in that presence he
did not dare to lie.

Judged, convicted, dumb, he stood before
the woman whose life he had blighted. Self-deception
was at an end, for in her cold
unimpassioned face he read that the love he
had deemed imperishable was as dead as the
drift-wood lying on the barren shore. And
at that moment of such shame as his soul
could know, he vrould have risked something
of the sordid venture he had yet to put to the
hazard could he have seen even a faint tremor
of the scornful lip, or, better still, a flush of
anger, if not of hate itself, in the cold star-like
eyes that looked level into his.

He opened his lips  not a word would
come.

He felt his. hands grow powerless, the

sinews of his neck relax, and this head droop,
struck to the core, not by her just indignation
and upbraiding  whatever there might be in
the bosom of the deep, the surface was cahii
to stagnation  but by his own utter vileness ;
and yet though he quailed before her in
abject silence he could not take his eyes
from hers.

Perhaps," she said in a very matter-of-fact
tone, " perhaps I am not of the chosen few to
whom you can dare to be ' downright and free-spoken,'
to whom you can intrust the ' story
of your life ' ? "

Whatever the craven had left of the man
was stung to life and action by these few
simple words.

Xo need of a mask now ; he could not be
more vile in her eyes.

To the winds with the plausible reason and
lying excuse, the role of vicarious martyr, the
secret enemy, mercenary relatives; all the arch
phantasmagoria of the well-rounded scheme
vanished like the baseless fabric of a dream
before the cold searcliini] i?aze of the fragile
girl they had been conjured up to deceive.

But the wrong lie had done lier in the days
that were gone, its callous treachery and
cruelty, rising in accusation through the vista
of the veiling years, seemed almost a sin to
which with a bold front a man miofht answer
at a man's tribunal, for the pleas that to her
would be lying sophistry would with many
men be justifying pleas.

But he had no sophistry to gloss over, even
to himself, the meanness that could make him
whisper love's sweet vocabulary in the ears of
a vain old woman, and so barter his comely
manhood for a mess of pottage.

His determination was taken, he would tell
her the truth, that is of his relations with
Miss Egbert ; as for the past, why, " let the
dead bury its dead ;" to that, if need came, he
would plead guilty.

With almost a recklessness of resolve he
drew from an inner pocket a small leathern
case, and taking therefrom a letter handed it
to her.

*' Eead," he said ; " I am on my defence,
and those who judge must hear the pleas."

She obeyed him.

The letter was from a lawyer demanding
instant payment for an overdue bill of two
thousand pounds. Its date was eight months
-old.

She gave it back to him, simply observing :

In what is this a plea ? "

Then his tongue was loosed.

Not a plea for my faithlessness to you," he
cried, speaking almost passionately; "for that
I have none to urge. But whether I sinned
from a shallow nature, or from fickleness, it
little matters now, for you, I am glad to see,
have learned to forget ; but I did not know till
to-night that I had that lesson still to learn."

She made a contemptuous gesture.

Forgive me," he continued ; " I am, for a
wonder, speaking truth, and the heart too will
have its word. In the days when you first
knew me I was very reticent, you may remember,
as to my family, and you as to your race,
matters of little moment then. I was reserved
because I did not care that you should know
that I was only a retired tradesman's son,
that I had no patrimony, and that my mother
was at intervals mad. When we parted I

went to Homburg, played heavily and won
largely. I came back to England to find my
father dead, my only brother also, and my
mother insane. There was only a bare
pittance for her support, and my sisters had
to earn their own living. Out of my gains I
settled two thousand pounds on my mother,
and then at once, leaving my address with no
one, went to Africa. I returned alone a few
months ago, all my money gone. My mother
had recovered and lived with one of my
sisters, an invalid, in our old home. The
doctors said that if kept tranquil and free
from any anxiety her malady might never
recur. She is a tender mother, Elsie, and she
loves me better than life. With the hope of
being as fortunate as before, I went monaco,
as the German tables were all closed. I won
largely at first, but luck changed, and  it is a
common tale  I played on recklessly till I had
lost ail. A friend who believed in my star
lent me money to go on, and I rose at last a
ruined man and two thousand pounds in debt.
I gave him a bill ; it became due ; I had no
funds to meet it. A writ was made out as-ain't

me, my mother heard of it, she wrote to the
holder of the bill, and offered to become
security if he would renew it for six months ;
he agreed, and now it is overdue eight months
and I have no funds."

He spoke rapidly, for him recklessly. "I
came here  do not judge me too harshly 
I came in despair, to hide myself ; I could not
face my mother's ruin. I met Miss Egbert,
and like a drowning man catching at a straw
I tried my luck, as I said to myself. It was
soon evident that I could win. I wrote to
the holder of the bill and told him the
position, and, scorn me as you may, he came
down and saw for himself, and agreed to hold
over what was my mother's death-warrant till
I had staked and won. I have not thrown
the die yet. It rests with you to consign my
mother to a pauper asylum, or to be generous
and forgive."

For a few moments after he had ceased
speaking Elsie stood in the same position
without a sin of emotion. Then with a
sudden passionate gesture as of loathing and
repudiation in one, she struck out her hands

to ware! s the abject suppliant before lier and
cried, looking at him with eyes ablaze :

My ! And I have loved that

thing ! "

The major shuddered. " I have lost," he
said to himself ; " she clings to the rags of her
love. Curse her and all women." Then in an
eager deprecatory voice he said aloud :

If she had been a young woman I would
not have asked it of you, Elsie ; you cannot
for a moment suppose that I love her," and he
made a step forward as if to approach her.

Back, Geoffrey Tyler," she cried ; " one
touch of your hand would be the crowning
insult of this night of humiliation. You
mistake me ; but you could not understand if
I told you. But rest assured, so far as I am
concerned, there are no birds in last year's
nest."

He winced. *' Can it be revenge, then ? "
he thought.

Listen ; you have gambled and lost. You
are in a strait, but you are a man of schemes,
and you have one that will free you. In this
scheme you ask my aid. Am I right ? "

VOL. I. 7

"Not your aid," lie said huskily, "your forbearance."


A quibble," lie returned in a tone of
abhorrence and placing herself so that he
could not escape her eyes. " My forbearance,
as you term it, is passive aid. The Egbertss
are strangers to me, but I know they are an old
and honourable family. You shall not befoul
them. Hush, I am not in a mood to pick my
phrases ; there are certain things that only
certain words can express. I do not know
how it is that I believe your story of your
mother ; perhaps I recognize the baseness
that let her risk her all. But as I do accept
it, in part at least, I also accept a responsibility
from which in God's sight I cannot
be absolved. It is  so you have said  
for your mother's sake only that you would
marry this woman fifty years old and
more."

Only, only," was all the answer he could
give. He had the o-race to shrink from even
his own voice.

Then if you pledge me your Avoid to
leave this place tomorrow, never to return, I

will pay this debt and free your mother. If
you refuse  you know the consequences."

"You!" he cried, fairly off his guard,
'' you are only romancing ; but perhaps it is
only a romans revenge," and he turned on
his heel in sullen despair.

Then I understand," she said, " you refuse
my terms and accept the alternative. It is
perhaps as well," and she gathered her shawl,
which had fallen to the ground, about her
shoulders and turned to go.

Stop," he cried fiercely ; " what warrant
have I that you are able to do this ? "

That I have said I am," was her proud
answer as she paused to give him a minute's
grace.

"It will only be a loan, remember." He
spoke as if it were he who conferred the
benefit. " What was the two thousand
pounds," he said to himself, " to Egbert Hall
and its broad acres ? "

She did not deign him an answer, she
merely drew her wrapping closer. " When
you have left Sandycot," she said,  " I
give you till tomorrow afternoon  I will

remit the money to my solicitor with instructions
to take up the bill and release your
mother. You need not give me the address ; the
holder of the bill is a well-known usurer."

"You will keep this secret?" he asked
falteringly.

That I pay the money, yes," and she was
gone.

Curse her," he muttered to himself as he
slowly followed. " She'll warn the old one,
but I'll be before her."

"A fool at forty is a fool indeed."

"Any letters for me?" asked Judy as lie
tripped round the breakfast-table, dispensing
lier good-morning' kisses. " I didn't know it
was so late, but the little Horseman kept me.
I took Tim for a run on the beach, and there
they were playing at Catherine wheels."

Yes, there is one from ]papa, I see ; it's on
your plate," said Mabella. " What can he be
writing to you about ? " and she smiled.

Oh, it will bs about the chestnut mare,"
cried Judy, flying at the letter like a bird ;
he said if she hadn't been unshod and
turned out to grass he would bring her here
and let me ride her."

"I don't think Peters," said Dulsie, naming
the stud-groom, ' will let her out of his care.
He expects great things of her at the show."

Oh, that's not till October," said Judy.

Peters and I are great friends," and she
opened her letter.

Oh, what a bore," she cried, for the moment
ruffled and disappointed. " Just listen ;
this is a note cousin Egbert incloses from
Peters himself :

' Honoured Miss, 

' Seeing as how the mare's not had the
exercise she daughter to 'ave had owing to the
young stock being extra troublesome-like,
she's got aside of herself quite, and takes both
bit and bitten to keep her in, it's not the
oats as the squire thinks, it's the mettlesome
devil in her,  saving your presence, and it's
nothing but a rare mastership handel suit her
tantrums for a bit, and she's not been set to
the sea or sea ways, the sand neath her foot
'ud set her wild, and I'd not answer the consequences
nor be 'possible either, so Honoured
Miss I says to the squire as I can't be spared
at this time noways, the foaling coming on suchlike,
as you'd best come up here a bit, you
see she is a rare beauty, she is, and I knows
you wouldn't for all the sea-breezes and

curled mows in the world go again her
chances at the show. The squire said as you
was so bent on 'having her, I'd best give you my
reasons in written, and begin' pardon for all
mistakes seeing as it's writ to order and
hurried like, I'm honoured.

' Miss your humble servant,

' Ted Peters.
' Stud-groom to Squire Egbert.
'Pes.  She's Glory Hannah now, as your
orders was, we changed her name in running
water for luck. T. P.' "

By the time Judy had come to the postscript
her momentary disappointment had
vanished and she was laughing heartily.

Gloriana, he means," she cried ; " but
what shall I do, Mabella ? Here's cousin
Egbert's letter," and she handed a short note
which accompanied the longer epistle to
Dulsie, seeing Mabella intent on her own correspondence,
which she had laid aside until
she should have poured out the tea.

Well, I suppose one of us must go with
you," and Dulsie handed on the note to

Sybella ; " papa seems to wish it very
much."

I can't," said Sybella ; " I am taking
Turkish baths and I couldn't possibly break
in on the series."

What is this ? " asked Mabella with a start
as she took the note from Sybella's hand. " I
have just had a letter from your mother,
Judy," but she did not offer to give Judy the
letter ; then she read the squire's few lines,
"leant, that's certain," she added; "just
look at these," and she pointed to the mirror
over the chimney-piece, the frame of wbicli
was full of envelopes and cards of invitation.
Dulsie's always glad of an excuse for a peep
at her flowers. What do you say, Dulsie ? Will
you go with Judy ? "

Dulsie assented, and it was arranged that
Judy and she should start next morning for a
week or ten days at Egbert Hall.

What is mamma writing about ? " asked
Judy ; " may I see her letter ? "

Mabella hesitated, and then drew the letter
out of her pocket. " You can read it aloud,"
she said, which Judy did :

' My dear Cousin, 

' You will be a little surprised at the
contents of this letter, which, I hope, will not
be wholly displeasing to your party. I have
not been very strong lately. I wanted change
and could not manage it, as of course Judy
was my first consideration ; but very oddly,
just after Judy had gone to you I got an
offer on very advantageous terms for my
house for two months. The family are very
quiet and ricci and few in number ; so, as I
had to decide at once, I said yes. This kept
me very busy getting ready, so I had no time
to write to Judy, and as before I put my
wishes in force I was anxious to know how
far they would meet those of your party, I
thought it best, instead of making her the
medium of communication between us, to
write to you direct myself. I purpose then
to come to Sandycot for a part of my holiday,
and if agreeable I should be glad if sou
would look, or let your maid help Judy to
look out for two quiet rooms for me somewhere
near you. I wish to be quiet, and
prefer lodgings to an hotel, as, living so long

alone, I may say I prefer my own hours and
humdrum ways. After a week or two of

Sandycot air I shall go into shire, where

I have some relations, one a retired naval
officer.

' With kind regards to your circle,

' Believe me yours sincerely,

' Mary Aylmere.

' Pes.  I have written hastily, or should
have said how much I appreciate your goodness
to Judy. I never feel uneasy when she is
with you, or I should he just now, as I heard
from some one who was in Sandycot lately
that the notorious rambler Major Tyler was
there. I fear he is a mauvais sujet and has
ruined many.' "

I am sure," commented Mabella when
Judy had finished, " I am quite sure that
that is slander. I know Major Tyler plays
whist well, and to your mother and her puritanical
circle at Casterham a game of 
would be gambling."

"That's the major's game, according to
mamma," laughed Judy.

They all laughed.

Well," continued Mabella, " the mauvais
sujet is going away. I have a civil note of
adieux and regrets. Here i is ; a servant
brought it early this morning ; ' a sudden summons
to a sick relation,' he says, that is all."

And that was all the note which now went
round the table stated, but a small inclosure,
not intended for that anticipated " round,"
had been read by the only eyes for which
it had been indited, and destroyed. Even
Dulsie looked at Mabella's beaming and a
little conscious face with surprise, but only
Sybella with suspicion.

For the moment Judy was conscious of
a fleeting feeling of disappointment, if not
regret. She had laughingly called the major
her " improver ; " she had enjoyed her little,
sly, " grown-up " flirtations, as she dubbed
her short tete-astute with the handsome
soldier, which he had imbued with the
charm, to a romantically inclined nature, of
a slight mystery, and on which he had left
the flattering impression that she had been a
little more than pleasant to his world-weary

soul. For the man himself she had not even
the shadow of a regret, perhaps, had she
known it, an indefinite sense of relief. Only
Dulsie made lament.

Oil, dear, I am so sorry," she said ; "just
as we had got to like him so much, the life
and soul of the place, and so attentive here.
It Alas only last nio'ht he told me that he
didn't know what he should do at the end of
the sea-bathing season, for that it was only
since he had known us that he had ceased
to regret the army."

Mabella sighed, a restful sympathetic sigh,
and smiled a bland and altogether inner
satisfied smile, and Sybella's keen eyes translated
their dumb language aright. But Judy,
always keenly alive to bathos, laughed outright.

From arms of steel to arms of flesh," she
cried, and then with exquisite mimicry of
Elsie Eber's still, impassioned manner, her
hand airily and flutteringly alight on the
sweet-scented bunch of flowers stuck carelessly
in her bosom, she said :

' Oil, for a falconers voice,

To lure this tassel-gentle back again.' "

Even Sybella laughed. Judy's 21ay was
demoralizing, lie was used to say ; and then,
to make amends for her frivolity, she added,
not a little viciously :

Xot a very complimentary quotation,
Judy : a hawk is a bird of prey."

I said a tassel-gentle, Sybella."

"Which stands for hawk if you want a
falconer's voice to lure. Oh Judy, Judy,

' Many a shaft at random sent,

Finds mark the archer never meant.'

But test it dear, whistle from Egbert Hall."

Mabella, inured to Sybella"s gibes, took not
the least notice, and Dulsie, naturally slow of
comprehension, did not quite understand, she
only knew that Sybella was at her " cuts "
again. Judy's heart was tender, and she
loved Mabella.

Sandycot will miss him," she said kindly ;
"it's not well off in tassel gentles. But there's
somebody who won't," and she laughed a
merry peal of laughter. "Indeed, now I
think of it, he has something to do with his
sudden departure." Another peal.

Who are you talking of, Judy ? " asked
Mabella.

"Ned," said Sybella. "I thought he was
jealous."

"Ned, indeed," and Judy tossed her head.
"I should Hke to know what right Ned woukl
have to be jealous of me with anybody."

"Then who? Mr. Green?" This from
Dulsie.

Judy rang another peal, and Tim, who was
discussing a chicken bone, thinking it a challenge
for a romp, rushed out of his house and
seized her skirt with his teeth, barking and
worrying.

That's right, Tim, speak for yourself," and
she lifted the little animal up by the shoulders
and turned his small defiant muzzle towards
his mistress.

Oh, Tim, you are the ingrate," said
Mabella; "after all the sweet biscuits he
brought you, too."

"And which he took with a snarl and ate
with his back to him," said Sybella.

"It was jealousy," and Mabella took a piece
of sugar and held it up to her pet. Judy had

to put him down in sharp haste, sugar was
one of Tim's weaknesses ; then lifting the
envelope of Major Tyler's note from the
table, she passed it across her face, saying :

How fond he was of cedar ; " and with a
sudden impulse she added, " I wonder if Tim
would know it."

Tim ran to her call, expectant of some
delicacy.

Whose is that, Tim ? " and she put the
envelope down before him. One swift", and
the next instant it was in shreds. The hair on
his back stood up like a hog's bristles, and
his breathing was smothered by rage.

Ah, Timothy, better have you for a friend
than a foe," said Judy, resuming her breakfast.
" Now go to your house," which
Timothy did with a rush, where, bringing
himself up on his hind quarters, his forelegs
stiff and straight before him, he sat on the
offensive letter and growled.

It was arranged that Mabella should look
for rooms for Mrs. Aylmere, and that Judy
and Dulsie should go to Egbert Hall in the
morning for a short stay.

At twelve o'clock, their letters written,
each went her separate way, to meet again at
two for luncheon ; Sybella to her Turkish
bath, Dulsie to her room to give packing
directions to her maid, Mabella on a lodf]inof
quest ostensibly, Judy to Seapinks by appointment.


Unless within their own domicile, the door
shut and the Venetians down, Sandxot had
the happy knack of making every one feel en
evidence. Trees, which in far more exposed
places by the sea grow with care and nursing
into gratefully shaded fulness, at Sandycot never
attained the proportions of even a moderate
pollard. So unrelieved by arboreous amenities,
the stiff terraces stared at each other ;
the four sides of a solitary square, with their
pretentious porticoed mansions, looked scornfully
over the head of the meagre shrubbery
in the centre at their monotonous replicas
opposite, and the somewhat narrow streets,
with their bay windows, seemed part of an
idle community for ever agape for news.
But it was the boast of Sandycot that there
was not a house within its precincts that

from some given quarter could not command
a view of the sea. " It is the only summer
resort," said Miss Turner, the spiral young
lady, " that does not boast a lover's lane."

Yet the " old, old story " managed ever and
again to make itself heard by the ears for
which it was meant, and many an hour fled
on wings too swift for happy hearts, beating
under the lee of a derelict coble, or better far
wandering by the long, long stretch of golden
sand rounding to the base of distant battlements
of cliffs, their silence broken only by
the murmuring music of the sea, their solitude
by " gleams of curlews ; " better, fitter
place than even woodside covert or woodbine
lane for that mutual transmutation of self
which the world calls delusion, religion idolatry,
and heaven love.

The favourite lodinojs for the itinerant
were in Shore Street, which, some feet above,
faced the sea. In this street were Sandy cot's
principal shops, its club, and its chief hotel.
Here, over the circulating library, Mrs. Beau-morris
had her pleasant rooms.

The tide would not be at the full till two

VOL. L 8

o'clock, but the streets were at this hour, a
little after twelve, emptied of strollers, who
were either in the shade of their habitations or
under improvised tents on the shore.

Mabella with a three volume novel in her
hand entered the library. There she found
Mrs. Beaumorris, turning over the leaves of a
book of poems, and opposite her, his back
against a centre stand of photographs, and
making: idle pictures on the ground with his
stick, Major Tyler. A rapid glance told lier
he was a prisoner against his will. Mabella,
who was singularly void of tact, and to-day
not a little flustered, only acknowledged Mrs.
Beaumorris's presence with the stiffest of
bows, but shook hands warmly with her
companion.

I'm a little late," she whispered, or in what
she believed to be a whisper, which reached
Creamy 's ear. A gleam of mischief and spite
combined contracted her sleepy eyes.

An assignation evidently," she said to herself.


"What have you been reading, Miss Egbert?"
she asked, taking up one of the volumes Mabella

had laid down ; then anticipating the reply,
Oh ! ' Not Wisely, but Too Well.' Don't you
think that titles of novels are often very
suggestive texts ? A world of romance, reality,
and warning' she emphasized the last word,
lie in these simple words. Ah, major ! " she
turned her eyes convincingly on that gentleman,
who was anything but at his ease, 'i'm
afraid it is the reverse with men, they generally
love wisely, but not too well."

The major was not in a mood to be trifled
with. The rebuff the beauty had given him
the previous night was not forgotten  it had
been scored against her. His desradincc
position to the woman he had despised and
wronged, his enforced and humiliating departure,
now at hand, the imminent risk he
was now running of losing his last chance of a
few words with Mabella, words on which, if
only spoken to-day, his very fate depended,
all working together roused the savage, perhaps
never very latent in him. He turned quickly
so as to again face his enemy, and sneering ashe
took off his hat in adieu, at the same time
holding back a chair to let her pass out, he

said, " It was from philanthropy I used to make
love, belle Creamy, for you know the best
thing to keep a woman from playing the devil
is to encourage her in playing the fool."

He had spoken between his teeth, and only
to the ear for which the words were intended.
Just for a second, as if stunned, Mrs. Beau-morris
stayed her exit, then the blood left her
face  Creamy never flushed  and with a
supercilious astonished look, as if the man,
hat in hand before her, was some presumptuous
lacquey, some inferior social creature, she went
slowly and composedly out of the shop, slightly
bowing to Mabella.

Just then the librarian brought the exchange
books for which the latter had asked, and
Major Tyler taking them, said he would carry
them so far as their roads laid together.

When they got into the street he said, preserving
an indifferent manner with cautious
regard for the points of observation in the
upper windows opposite :

I have something of vital importance to
say to you ; is there any place where I can see
you alone ? "

They are all out at the Lodge," she said,
'* and luncheon is not till two."

My train leaves at two," he said ; *' I'll
desire a fly to call for me at the Lodge ; my
luggage will go with the hotel omnibus."

This he did. Tim had accompanied Judy,
the coast was clear. Just for one moment,
when the door closed and Glabella stood in expectant
attitude before him, Major Tyler felt
his confidence fail him. He had drawn a rough
mental outline of his intended statement ; was.
clear as to the absolute fiction and the more-deceiving
half truths, had weighed well the
exact amount of fervour and passion that would-be
fittingly necessary to press his suit, and had
sorted out for ready use his repertory of moral-platitude,
chivalric fustian, and religious-patter
; but though thus cap-a-pie he was at
fault  he did not know where to besoin, whether
to put the vital question at once and leave
the awkward explanations till the prize was
secured, or to tell the "story of his life,"
judicious edited, and trust to pity and love
for the rest.

The musical clock on the chimney-piece

struck up its horary tune, and told the hour
of one. He had only twenty minutes to dare
and do.

"You are in trouble, Major Tyler," said
Mabella ; " I hope your sick friend is not a
very near relative." She had given the cue ;
Geoffrey Tyler was himself again.

His story is best told in his own words 
words of rapid utterance, now his tongue was
unloosed, but each duly proportioned and
harmoniously coloured, making a narrative of
perfect mosaic, artfully designed.

We have been something more than
friends, Mabella," he said. ' /, at any rate,
have found, I fondly believe, rest for my soul
in your sympathy and womanly tenderness, so
unlike the selfish absorption and exacting exclusiveness
of raw girls. Even in my reckless
days, when I was ready to vow away my very
life at the foot of beauty, I knew that my
heart could never be reached but by a ' perfect
woman, nobly planned, to warn, to comfort
and command,' a woman Avhom time and
perhaps trial had mellowed and elevated, who
could in short understand a love apart from

passion, and give in return a generous, believing,
and forbearing love. The Cupid in
me was never blind, Mabella, and so it came
that when I saw too clearly, and sickly passion
palled me, when I turned aside in very weariness
of soul, that my lovers became my
enemies. You know

' Heav'n has no rage like love to hatred tarred,
Nor hell a fury like a woman scorn'd.'

And such relentless hatred has followed me
for ten long years. To free myself from its
consequences I left my profession, for she had
sworn my disgrace, and she had a tongue of a
syren and the cunning of a serpent. I was
helpless in her hands. Then to escape the
range of her power I expatriated myself, and
buried myself in Africa. It was only a
few months since I returned, trusting, like a
fool, that time had softened her rancour. I
did not hide myself in my own country ; I
went to my club, showed myself in my
old haunts, and at last came here, an idle
wanderer in quest of bracing air  and,
Mabella, last night we, that woman and /, met''

Mrs. Beaumorris ? " said Mabella.

"No, no, though I sighed at her feet too,
not her ; Creamy has not vitality enough to
nourish a stronger than passive and spiteful
hate ; she discourages emotions, they leave
wrinkles, she says, but she will do her vicious
best to injure me if it comes in her way."

Then who ? " asked Mabella throwing: off
her bonnet, her face flushed and her eyes
moist.

Miss Eber ! "

Oh, that mysterious, colourless, cold,
abstracted girl. Oh Geoffrey, I could believe
anything of that woman. Did she love you ? "'

Yes, with a savage love. Oh, how I
sickened of her, but I had trusted her in the
first warmth of my delusion with every secret
of my life, and when I broke from lier she
vowed to use her poAver to blast me. She believes
she has supernatural power. It looks
like it."

But what can she do to you ? "

I am coming to that, but I wished you to
understand something of my youthful nature.
I am forty-four now ; that my one bitterly

repented misdeed might not seem so heinous
in your sight, it was at any rate not sinned
against you. My first regiment was the 6th
Dragoons ; it was quartered in Ireland. I was
barely twenty. I could not hunt like the others,
for I was not rich ; I would not gamble, for
I had no money to lose; there was nothing
but shooting for leisure  shooting and my
lady's bower. I chose the latter. The
colonel's wife was a handsome woman ; she
rushed from one intrigue into another. The
colonel was a bully, and detested by men and
officers, but he was not master at home. He
was a little wizened martinet, mean of soul,
but a good barrack soldier. men who admired
her pitied her, but she had plenty of
consolation. I was green ; I did not pull up intime.
The colonel discovered our intimacy, and
we ran off: to be more accurate, she ran off
with me. Well, the usual course of things
happened. She was divorced and I married
her. I exchange-ed into another regiment and
went to India. Of course there was no love
between us, but I was chivalrous in those
days, and I bore a great deal ; bore till my

honour was compromised, and then I came
home and sued for a divorce. Before the
case came on I received a letter telling me. she
was dead  had been killed by a fall from
her horse. Oh, Mabella, the awful feeling of
relief that came over me when I realized that
I was free ! It was then that I met Elsie Eber
there is no time to say where or how. She
was very lovely. There was something soothing
to me in the thought that she was only a
simple maiden ; that her name had never been
before the world, that no one knew of our
relations to each other. I told her everything
in the reckless trustfulness of my nature. I
even gave her letters that ought to have been
sacred : I hid nothing of mv life from her.
I was deeply in debt and in the hands of the
Jews, for the divorce and all that had followed
had involved me deeply. I told Elsie I could
not take her to a home of shameful shifts and
privations, that any day might see me in a
debtors' prison. Then her brother  I do not
believe now that he was her brother  offered
to lend me two thousand pounds, to be repaid
when I sold out of the service. He did so, I

giving him simply my I.O.U., and at the same
time a pledge to marry his sister, who was to
know nothing of the contract. This promise
I mvQ in writings. When I came to think
over my bargain coolly I saw the trap into
which I had fallen. I discovered too that
she was a Jewess, a race which I abhorred.
The fancy I had called love had been worn
out by her vehemence, and my heart was
as dead to her as to a stone. But there was
no f.'oinor back."

' Did she not see you had ceased to care
for her?" asked Glabella tremblingly. She
was naturally keen of perception, and dimly
she felt the weak points of her wooer's
specious narrative, but she was as yet too
much under the glamour he had thrown over
her to do more than meekly indicate that her
faculties were only dormant.

' She was too self-absorbed in her own
fierce passion," he replied ; " she believed in
herself  outside herself she had no rancfe.
The day was fixed for our marriage, when
I received a letter that my ivife was still living
and in London. She had caused the report of

her death to be sent home to stay the divorce
proceedings. It was a terrible position, and
yet I was sensible at the moment of a feeling
of relief, for I knew that she who was still my
wife would never claim me, and she who would
be my wife could not. 1 left the place where
we were and wrote to Elsie, sending her the
letter stating the fact of my wife's existence.
I have only a dim remembrance of what
followed ; I know she followed me to London
and that she reproached me with wild rage.
I was over-wrought, a brain fever ensued.
When I recovered I was a wreck, but Elsie's
persecutions had begun. She refused to believe
that I did not know that my wife was
living when I met her first, and accused me
of getting money from her brother fraudulently.
In despair I sold out and repaid
her brother the two thousand pounds. A
week after I had done so he died. I had
omitted to get back my I.O.U., and this Elsie
row held and refused to give up. I went
to Africa, but before I went I stood by my
wife's dead body in her sister's house, and
obtained a le]fal certificate of her death from

the doctor. Then, free at last, I rushed into
savage life. If I had then been forced to marry
Elsie Eber, I would have put a pistol to my
head. Last night we met on the pier by appointment.
She gave me twelve hours to
leave Sandycot, and swore that if I refused she
would sue me for the two thousand pounds ;
not, she said, for the sake of the money, but to
blast me in the eyes of every friend I possessed,
and she can do so. Few would believe,
even on proof, that I was misled as to
my wife's death, and except the letter stating
the fact, which I had received from a friend
and on which I stopped the divorce proceedings,
I had no proof. Then who would believe
my version of the two thousand pounds ? No,
Mabella, there is no mistake, she has me
hemmed in. Many names would be compromised,
dishonourably, for she kept letters I had
shown her. You see I tell you everything,
not palliating one jot or tittle of my folly, and
you know yourself the world will condemn
me because I did not redeem my promise to
marry the girl when I found I could."

Mabella had wept copiously during the

major's recital. Her tears lead encouraged
him. There was a pause.

It is nearly half past one," she sobbed ;
' what are you going to do ? "

The wheels of the fly were heard in the
avenue.

I am going away, like a hunted deer,
a hopeless outcast, but if you would only say
that when this indignation is overcast a'ou
will see me once more, I shall not despair."

Mabella looked up ; her nose was very red,
her eyes also ; tears always made Mabella 's
features swell.

Geoffrey," she said, " come back when you
like, you shall be welcome ;" and she held out
her hand, shading her weeping eyes with the
other, which held a handkerchief.

He seized the offered hand, kneeling on one
knee, and kissed it.

One moment, Mabella"  the door bell rang
loudly  "give me your word that you will not
let Elsie poison your mind against me. I have
told you all without reserve, but she has
powerful influence ; I dread her."

Geoffrey, she shall not tell her story tome

; I believe you, that suffices. I am a true
woman," and bending down she kissed his brow.

And promise me," he spoke in a fervid
whisper, " that you will be my wife, my
beloved, trusting, adored wife."

And Mabella, fairly overcome, her full
motherly bosom heaving with sympathy, lier
heart soft with pity and her senses glamoured
and blinded by vanity and a spurious emotion
she mistook for love, gave her promise.

The servant to announce the fly was heard
approaching the door. The major, collected
and unruffled, took his hat, and as the door
opened held out his hand in formal adieu.
I shall be there in a minute," he said, and
the man disappeared.

Mabella, to hide her tear-stained face, had
turned her back. When the door closed, she
turned round and smiled through her tears.

"We are one now, Geoffrey," she whispered,
a little shamed ; " this is my first privilege,"
and she handed him a cheque for a
hundred pounds.

With almost nervous eagerness his fingers
closed on the flimsy piece of paper. Cheques

had grown in these later precarious years unfamiliar
to him. The crisp touch reanimated
hope  it was as a dram to a worn man.

For love's sake," was his sole answer ; and
as if from an uncontrollable impulse, he suddenly
wound his arms round Mabella's portly
form, and kissed her full round cheeks.

My wife, my rest, my love, my salvation,"
he cried ; then with another farewell kiss he
hastened away.

As the Hy issued from the Lodge gate, Elsie
Eber and Judy, who had stood aside to let it
pass, entered. The major, well back in the
corner, his hat over his brow, with his usual
' cursed luck," he said to himself, caught a recognizing
glance from Elsie's eyes and received
a valedictory snarl from Tim, who struck by
some sudden thought set up his bristles and
scampered home, not once drawing breath till
he found on inspection that his own particular
residence had not been invaded by the
enemy. Elsie, whom Judy had brought to
luncheon, met with a repulsively cold reception
from Mabella, and so the words of warning
remained unuttered, the story untold.

He has been before me," she said to
herself, " but he cannot hurt me. When
pressing need comes then I will speak," and
strolling in the garden with Judy, she wove a
little plan, to be dependent on the progress of
the scatter, to take Judy into her confidence,
but not yet.

VOL.

Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure,
Thrill the deepest notes of woe."

To him that in love of nature holds communion with her
visible forms, she speaks a various language."

It would be liard to say to wliicli this impromptu
visit to the country brought the
greatest pleasure, to Dulsie or to Judy ; to
Judy, perhaps. Youth has a capacity, a brain
and physical power of enjoyment, that when
years have run over the third, in rare cases
the fourth, decade, fail in intensity. Euhng
passions, strong proclivities, are seldom subdued
by time ; but in ordinary natures, with
no pronounced extremes, when the daughters
of music are low and the windows darkened,
desire fails, and the cup of pleasure is as wine
from which the spirit has gone. But there is
a placid enjoyment known only to that period
when the brook and river meet, when the
hair is a little more than gray and the eye

a little less than bright, when the step is firm
as ever, but with no elastic spring, when the
voice, strong and sweet as of old, never
wakes love's echo. Then the pulses beat with
rhythmical tranquillity, sensible of no depression
in Autumn's dull sorrowing season, or
quickening in Summer's golden prime. Not
insensible, not cold, we take the goods the
gods provide, with serene unruffled enjoyment,
vibrating to, but no longer sounding
notes of rapture's diapason.

There was not a haunt of bird or flower
in the wood and coppices and the outlying
lands of the Egbert domain that Judy did not
know. The shepherd, old Giles, an honoured
servitor of fifty years' standing, and Judy,
were firm friends. From him she had learnt
wonderful secrets of outdoor life, secrets
which he never wearied in the telling
and she never wearied in the hearing.
While the slow sheep browsed from point
to point, sometimes in the hollow, sometimes
in the turf of the slope, Giles had to sit still,
keeping them always in view, leaning on his
crook or reclining against a friendly tree.

92

There he would ponder, reading curiously in
Nature's book. In Scotland, on the bleak
hill-sides, the shepherd, moving or standing,
plies his knitting-pins, but in the sheltered
south there is more to distract his mind in
the herbaceous coppices. Green lanes and
bridle tracks, Giles knew them all for miles
round, short cuts to evade the turnpike tolls
and springs that in drought were never dry.
He was a herbalist, too, in a narrow way,
knowing chiefly those of medicinal properties.
He knew the wild flowers, too, calling them
by quaint old names. To some were attached
strange tales tingled with witchcraft  not the
wild romantic legends of the north, but weird
evil stories, the outcome probably of some
slight incident, that breaking in on the dull
monotony of old pastoral life had made
a stir in the district and so gradually, from
tongue to tongue, had gathered and grown
till they stood forth in all the proportions of
a rural tradition, and by the curious were
added to the ingeniously gleaned records of
folk-lore.

He knew the hiding-places of the pink

pimpernel, just on the verge of the ripening
corn : the moist drives of the mead, where
show the pale lilac cuckoo flower and maw-thorn,
and where the wind anemone blows
in the copse. Spots, too, were known to him
where gay groups of double buttercups grew,
and loamy ditch shores rich with the lovely
blue crane's bill and the herb " Robert,"
with its changing foliage, lying " like crimson
lace" on the coarse herbage of the bank.
The foxglove, crimson and white, was there,
red clover in patches, the claus (marsh ranunculus)
and blue bell. Bright gleams, too, of
the white violet, and in places where the
water rose to a certain height, a stately flag-lily
could be found. And like a gay vesture
over the thick-set hedge on the far side were
flung the woodbine and briar-rose, intermingled
with the silent bells of the white
and striped wind-bind (convolvulus). Giles
knew, too, mossy glades where rare ferns
lurked, and stubbly ridges where tall grasses,
many hued, clustered in sheaves. He would
gather them for the "little Miss," the term
by which he was wont to designate Judy in

her earlier girlhood, and to which he always
held. Gorgeous bouquets Judy reared from
these wild spoils of covert and open, dashing
in, in brilliant effects, the scarlet poppy, the
blue-bottle," and time old " eggs and butter"
bow she loved the archaic names. Many a
strange flower talk she and Giles had together
in terms that would have puzzled the learned
botanist.

Of the world and the world's ways old Giles
knew little. He had never been taught to
read, and the stories of foreign battles, kings
overthrown, famines, and earthquakes, presented
no more reality to his mind than the
chapters from Revelations to which on occasion
he listened in the dreary old parish
church. The outer world Alas as dim a world
to Giles as that to us where are leviathan and
creeping things innumerable. Of doctrinal
or dogmatic religion he knew as little as the
untaught heathen, but somehow, from the
unlearned cottage preacher, perhaps, Giles
had got, as the Methodists phrase it, the
real things " into his heart, and as much of
it as was necessary into his head. It needed

but very simple words to express old Giles'
simple creed, that all men were sinners 
how, he could not quite " tackle," but he believed
they were, for God said so, and he
knew he was one ; and as they were born
sinners, sin came so natural-like to them that
they never could shift themselves of it, so God
sent his own Son to wash them clean by His
blood and to tell them how to keep clean.
That was about all.

He liked the cottage preaching, which were
full of rural images and vivid illustrations
from cottage life, but he had a great respect
for the gentry and a duty to the squire, so he
bared his head every Sunday morning on his
wooden seat in the dim, dusty, high-sewed
church and repeated the responses to prayers,
made, he supposed, for the gentlefolks, they
were " so grand like." The religion of his
every day life was uprightness in word and
deed, and a watchful independence that made
him " owe no man anything." This was his
rendering of what he supposed his relations
to God required of him. What God was to
him ten thousand voiced nature alone could

have told. Giles saw Him in the meanest
weed that grew and heard Him in the voiceless
stars. He knew Him in the teeming life
of the animal world, that living evidence of
mysterious creative power and tender fatherly
care.

They were red-letter days to Giles when
the little miss was at the Hall, the one bond
of sympathy being Judy's preference for the
simple wild flowers of the field over the gorgeous
and perfume-laden exotics of the greenhouse,
and her great love for the wild denizens
of the trees and fields.

They arrived at Egbert Hall by an early
train, and after luncheon her first visit was
to the stables to see Gloriana. She was
accompanied by the squire.

*' Isn't she a born beauty, miss," said
the proud Peters, as scarcely held in by
the light bridle he had thrown over her
head, the mare came prancing out of her box
stall.

' And isn't she well named ? " cried the
delighted girl ; "her skin is like cloth of gold.
Can I ride her to-day ? "

She be's uncommon fresh, miss ; but I
knows you're a tight one, and she knows it
too, and if you'll be content with the ring for
the first try, I think, if the squire's agreeable,
it'll be safe enough."

By this Judy had quietly sidled up to the
proud-looking, splendid animal, now pawing
the ground with impatient hoof. Her gentle
strokes, like mesmeric passes, calmed the fire
and fret, and Gloriana bent her lofty head to
the young girl's face, held fearlessly up, and
smelt her hair, which her hat tipping off had
left uncovered.

Give me the bridle," said Judy, which, a
little fearing, Peters did. Then she kissed the
still drooped head between the eyes and spoke
sweet nonsense, words of cheer and endearment,
and lastly she slipped out of her pocket
a piece of sugar, which Gloriana ate as peacefully
and with as much enjoyment as a two-year-old
babe. The sugar finished, the
mare whinnied, and just holding the reins
lightly in her left hand, her right entwined
in the glossy mane and her cheek pressed up
against her favourite's arched neck, Judy led

the way to the ring, Gloriana deporting herself
Hke a limb.

She remembers miss," said Peters, following
with the squire in rapt admiration of the
pair. " She's martel fond of me, too, in her
way, but 'cause she knows she can't play her
tantrums with me she's fond o' showing off a
bit, an' if I got aback o' her now she'd mebbe
up with her head and try 'delusions (conclusions)
with me. But she ain't got a bounce
o' vice ; it's just with horse-flesh same ways
as women-flesh ; it's the sprack ones as is
easiest managed, and safest, too, in the long
run."

Peters, though a cockney born and bred,
had yet lived so much in the provinces that
he had made his own many a quaint word of
dialect and old form of speech.

Arrived at the ring  a large inclosed field
so called, with turfy bordering  a groom
brought Judy the trainer's skirt, an impromptu
substitute for her habit, and thus
simply accoutred she sprang from Peters'
hand like a bird into the saddle.

Judy could ride. She had had a few initiatory

lessons by lier mother's desire, who believed
only in things according to pattern ;
but Judy's riding had nothing of conventional
riding about it ; she was as much at her ease
in her saddle  or without it, as Peters could
tell had he been given to tell tales out of
school  as on the hioh swino-bouo-h of the
old elm, on which she always declared she
had got her best lessons. She was, as the
common phrase is, a piece of her horse.

To-day, Gloriana had only" a snaffle, but to
every touch of the slight hand that held therein
she answered with the precision of a
lio:ht skiff to the helm. At the first 2:0 ofl
Judy's rebellious hat slipped backwards, but
she caught it deftly and secured it by the
string to her crutch. Her hair was tied, as
usual when she was, as she phrased it, on the
loose, in a bunch behind, or, as Peters harshly
termed it, in a bang tail. This floated and
feathered and streamed at will of the light
breeze and swift motion. At starting, just
to remind Gloriana of something: she knew a
little of before  her strength of will  she kept
the reins firmly in hand and made the first

round of the ring in a slashing trot ; then
with a whisper of commendation and an encouraging
pat she relaxed her tension very
slightly and made the second in a wanton
canter, the splendid animal beneath her
bounding and curvetim?, starting in affected
timidity at a familiar blackbird, and switching
her tail in " show off," Peters said, " again
miss." Not a movement of Judy could be
detected apart from her horse ; it was a
perfect harmony of motion, and the mare's
frolic, fun, and pranks, her gay revelry of
freedom, were to the lookers-on the sporting
of two happy beings in exquisite unison each
with the other.

So when, at the third round, Judy gave the
reins a jubilant shake and drew her lithe
figure in closer form, the mare with fiery
response dashed off in an abandoned gallop
that sent the turf beneath her feet flying
over her head and Judy's blood coursing
with wild fervour through every vein of her
body.

Two such rounds the pair took, and then
with a firm decisive check Judy drew up

sharp to a stand beside the proud Peters and
just a little nervous squire.

You've no fears now, Peters," she said as
she alighted on the ground, "just for all the
world," he afterwards told his wife, " like a
bit o' thistledown."

I only wish," was his reply as he touched
his cap, " I only wish, miss, as it could be
mannerly-like for you to ride in the ring at
the show, an' she'd fetch a price as 'ud make
the countryside's mouth water."

Oh, cousin Egbert," cried Judy in real
distress, "you promised me never to sell
Gloriana."

And I never shall, Judy," he replied.
"Peters must be content with her taking a
prize, and Pm sure she'll do that."

A prize, the prize, you mean ; nothing
short of the medal will satisfy either Peters orme,
will it, Peters ? "

"There's narra onely touch her, miss; an'
it's known too, it is, don't you be feared," and
he led the mare away, not a hair turned, ashe
pointed out, but whinnying with backward-glances
at Judy.

*' Now, cousin Egbert," she said, her eyes
dancing in the sunshine, " my scamper has
put me in such very high feather I'll be off to
old Giles and the birds. I'm bound to go to
him sharp, for he's sure to find out I'm hereby
hook or by crook' and she was off.

The squire stood, as she flitted across the
fields like a gay butterfly, watching with
loving eyes till she was lost in a copse, at the
far end of which he had told her she would
find the old shepherd.

The weather had been exceptionally dry,
and the meadows were in parts parched and
brown, but outside the copse, on the rise of
the hill, there was a little streamlet that,
according to tradition, had never, even in
seasons of severest drought, been known to
dry up. The grass on the hill, too, overshadowed
in parts by the copse, was green
and luxuriant.

Here Giles had his trusty dogs Sam and
Beck at his side.

From this point of observation he could
command the movements of his fleecy treasures
further than the eye could see. They

were some four hundred in number, not more
than two hundred of which lay within his line
of vision.

But Giles knew that any disturbance of
those beyond his ken would be immediately
communicated to the rest of the frock, and a
word to Sam and Beck would send succour
on wings.

The quiet streamlet mile by mile widened,
till issuing from the boundary of the Egbert
estates it became a broad river.

Here it was the ever fresh sparkling stream
babbling over tiny flints ; but the sheep,
grazing at will, cropped the herbage too
closely to admit of flowers except under
some boulder, or in the cleft of a decaying
tree-root.

An osier bed was near. Here was the first
of many hundreds of pollards, that sparsely at
first, and thickly afterwards, clothed the banks
of the broadening stream for miles down the
valley.

Not far from the osier bed was a pool of
clear limpid water, to wdiicli in the meridian
heat of the day the cattle from the uplands

came to slake their thirst, and not a stone's
throw from the pool stood Giles' cottage.

"Did you know I had come?" asked Judy
after a friendly greeting of her humble
friend.

"A was back the stable-yard first thing
tha day," replied Giles, " an' a seed Mr.
Peters rubbing' down the chestnut mare. He
zed nar a word but the time o' day, buta'
says to myzen as tha little miss wud be o'
cummin', an' I vor on the watch. There's a
rare lot o' nests about an' a lot o' 3oung 'uns
on the wing."

Then Judy patted the grave Sam and
indifferent Beck in cfreetinf, too, which attention
they acknowledged by the scarcely perceptible
movement of the feathery termination
of their tails ; ordinarily they recognized
acquaintance with nothing living outside the
shepherd and their charge.

Well," she said, " they're as dry and
crusty as any old bachelors ; they're not like
Tim."

Ackerdish times vor the ship if they twos
like that varmint," said Giles dryly. " No

further nor thick lambing, when Miss Egbert
vor thin tha house there with tha missus,"
he indicated the cottage by a side nod, " he
sinks alert uncensured like, on a' happens to
zee hin, an' in a yap he had a ridden lamb as
vor in tha gain by the drew. Miss, she
comes running out, an' Sam here vor on unlike
a flash. It would ha' gone hard with the
varmint only a' chokes hyn off, an' then there
vor a shindy, but I'm born' to say as Sam got
the worst on it."

And the lamb ? " asked Judy.

A' did noa good ; the missus kept it a bit
by the fire, an' worked with it, but a' died.
And just to zee Miss Egbert carrying' thistle
doovel away in hern arms. Ye haven't
brought Tim, miss, lev sees ? "

Judy' reassured her friend on that point,
and then asked had he fulfilled an old promise
and found her a cuckoo's egg. This Giles had
done.

And then followed what Judy called her
bird-chatter. Giles had to give an account of
mutual friends ; if the old swallows had come
back to the cottage porch, the starlings to the

VOL. 1. 10

chimney. Had he seen a kingfisher on t.lie
stream, and how many pah's of water wagtails
had he counted ?

He had to tell, too, of the nest of the redbreast
he had found at the root of the old
elm near the sheepcote, and how he tended it
on Sundays when lads got into the park, and
at last saw the fledglings safe on the wing and
able to take care of themselves.

Many a story of the blue-tit and the cole-tit,
of the yuckills in the sallywithy he had to
tell, of the white blackbird that found a mate
and built in the laurels, and which the gamekeeper
killed (Judy echoed Giles' still warm
indignation at the senseless deed), and of the
venerable pair of ravens, great intimates of
the shepherd and his little miss, who this
year, as before, had reared their small family
undisturbed on the centre of the great cedar's
topmost branch in the deer park. He had
taken the old pair a dead rabbit now and
again ; they never now, he said, moved a
feather when he came on them.

When Judy had exhausted her questions,
Giles rose with an air of mystery, and desiring

Sam and Beck to lie close lie bade her follow
him cautiously.

It bees late for them," he said, " but
they've bin more than like disturbed at some
other bit. They're dogged cute rustics, too,
but there's no been' up to ' varmint,' " a term
applied by Giles to all dogs outside collies.
"Tha gamekeeper he vor after a stoat he'd
started fran the elder (hedge), and I vos
watching him dodging it, when I seed some
o' the rubble  dead leaves and the like  move.
A kep' still as Sam there, an' then a sees income
out, it vor sunset, and up he flies on
thick branch."

They had reached a hedge beside an old
elm with a sweeping branch drooping over,
and to this Giles pointed.

And themmiii he basins an' zinos till the
copse is as still as death from nought but
jealousy."

Oh, Giles, is it a nightingale ? "

"That's about it, little miss," he replied,
his keen sunken eyes gleaming with pleasure
at his companion's delight. " Sees guessed
it ; it bist the faintest like nest a' ever seed,

102

an' there vor five eggs, a green-brown. A'
kep' one, but alia hen her laid another. Tha
joung 'uns lev bin out 'em two weeks, an'
I've my eye on one I'll take and middle for
sees."

Just one peep, taken on tiptoe, Judy
allowed herself. The parent birds were absent,
and she could see the fledglings huddled
together in terror, and almost outgrown their
nest. Giles, with tender, careful hand, scattered
dry leaves and grasses to hide any
marks of disturbance, and then the pair
returned to the stream-side and stood awhile
by the shady pond to watch the moor-hens
and dab-chicks skim and dive. After a
little Judy drew from her pocket a goodly-sized
parcel, the aroma of which instantly
attracted Giles' notice.

"It's the best I could get at Sandycot,
Giles. The showman did declare he'd had it
through some one who had got into trouble
about it, so he said. He wanted me to
believe it was extra good because it was
smuggled. I suppose you see it is labelled
pure Virginia ? "

And zo it bees, little miss," and Giles
applied this nose to it with the gusto of a connoisseur
; " it's bist prime Virgin," and he
took off his hat With grateful courtesy to the
smiling girL

Judy had a word for the shepherd's wife,
querulous and feeble with age and rheumatism,
but the cottage was clean and snug, and
Giles was " used to her laddie." He was outmost
of the day, he said. She was a tidy
woman still, and, the Lord be praised, he was
growing deaf.

Judy threaded her way home by herself,
keeping, as a change, close by the brook.
Its downward course was checked at intervals
by hatches, which forced the water out into
the meadows and into small ponds. These
hatches were movable. One Judy knew
well. It was moss-grown and in a quiet
shady corner ; there the kingfishers resorted
for food, which they find readier in brooks
and in such like small watercourses than in
the mere and broader expanse of waters.
Over the brook, beside this mossy hatch,
were overhanging branches, where they could

perch and watch for their prey. Without
this wary survey they do nothing. The day
was nearing to evening ; it was clear and still.
Judy stood apart, for perched on a slender
twig arching over the water was a halcyon,
as she loved to call the kingfisher. There it
sat in kingly guise. Seen from the distance it
looked like a gay water-flower. Judy kept
the utter stillness the bird loves ; there was a
movement in the clear depths below, and like
a rainbow-flash the bird descended, and then,
darting upwards with a small trout in its
beak, flew swiftly to the distant pond, where
its nest lay hid among the rushes, the red
and azure of its plumage glancing in the sunshine.


All things lovely and at peace Judy had
seen that day, and with her innocent heart
full of love and praise she wended her way
on, singing now and again snatches of songs
and erratic bars of church minstrelsy. Suddenly,
as she put her hand on a turnstile
which led her out of the last field of her
progress, she heard a sharp shrill note of
terror, and right at her foot, as if for

shelter, fell, rather than alighted, a green
linnet. Its head was turned upwards and its
beak open, not in defence, but paralyzed fear.
She stooped to pick it up, but before her
hand could touch it a shrike, or butcher bird,
swooped down and carried the quarry off in
triumph. Judy reached the door of Egbert
Hall pale and silent, the voice of music hushed
in her heart and her sweet eyes still moist
from the April shower that gushed forth at
the fate of the hapless linnet.

But it was strange," she said to herself as
she mounted the broad flight of steps to the
house, " I was not a bit sorry for the trout
the kingfisher caught, and that was a life, too.
Oh, it is all a tangle and a puzzle. It's a
cruel world, it is."

The towers in different ages rose,
Their various architecture shows
The builders' various hands."

DuLCiBELLA Egbert's vocation in life was
exotics ; not that lies was an exotic existence,
for Dulsie loved the open air, and wet or dry,
took a constitutional walk in the breezes
parts of the demesne. She believed in the
invigorating qualities of the wind, and in a
waterproof ulster she defied the rain. That
she was not a little rheumatic she laid at the
door of the hereditary Egbert gout, and it was
generally understood in the family that it was
no manner of use cautioning Dulsie against
damp or chill ; she would observe her own
regime as long as she could hobble.

The numerous greenhouses and the great
conservatory, which the late Mrs. Egbert had
added to the old hall, were Dulsie's especial
care and pride ; care from Jove for the fragile

existences of ardent climes, and pride from
enchanted admiration of their regal growths
and sun-dyed colours.

But there was no innate love of flowers for
the flowers' selves in Dulsie's nature of limited
sympathies. A daisy was .only a pretty weed
to her, and the so-called common garden
flowers, hardy roses, sturdy hollyhocks and
dahlias, little more. Their coarse beauty, she
said, was suitable to our vigorous climate, and
their proper place was the homely garden.
For her own preserves, as the squire called the
greenhouses, Dulsie had her particular gardener,
who, like his charges, was a very fine
piece of high culture. Between this functionary
and the head-gardener there was constant
war. But there was no denying the fact
of the rare beauty of the greenhouse plants
and flowers of Egbert Hall ; yet it was but
seldom that any were sent to compete for horticultural
prizes. Dulsie could scarcely be
tempted to risk a change of atmosphere for
her favourites. It was pretty well accepted
as a foregone conclusion by the country for a
vast horticultural area round, that when Miss

Dulcibella Egbert's name appeared as an 
it was also as a victor.

But she was not churlish in oivina. It
pleased lier to give seeds or cuttings ; whole
plants she rarely parted with. She had reared
and loved them, she said, and old friends ought
to be fixtures.

Her vocation suited Dulsie's temperament,
which was of the dolce far nienle type, and
except in her believing love and trust in
Mabella, and her ancestral creed of Egbert
intimacy, colourless. She loved her father
placidly, and in the same way endured Sybella,
whose gibes never even ruffled her serenity, and
whose deeper nature was a hidden mine to
her intelligence.

Live and let live " was Dulsie's motto, and
so fully did she adapt her life to that maxim
that the records of her past sears told of
neither a love nor a friendship that had left a
sorrow or a joy behind.

'" I think," said Sybella once, enraged at her
failure in an attempt to rouse Dulsie's anger
against the misdeed of a friend, "I think it
liicfh time the Egbert race should come to

an end when its stock shows evidence of
lymph."

Better lymph than virus, sister mine," was
Dulsie's smiling answer.

Dulsie's a good woman," said Mabella,
defending her, though she herself had resented
that particular misdeed ; " she loves her neighbour
as herself."

"A poor compliment to self when that
neighbour has broken nine-tenths of the
Decalogue, eh ? "

A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind,"
and Sybella spoke as if her mouth was dry.

Dulsie's guards to her assailant's arrows
were generally bags of sand, but she was not
wanting in a sort of quiet aggression when
fairly put to it, and more than once Sybella
had been rather neatly, as the squire would
say, turned over.

To-day she was just a trifle roused. This
misdeed of this especial friend of the family
had been flagrant  of that there was no question,
but Dulsie had argued, " Why let us cast
stones ? She passes from our circle naturally ;
let her be."

Not SO Sybella ; she had made her own
protest loudly, so had Mabella, and she was
indignant, yet perhaps a little conscience-touched
at Dulsie's forbearance, and so, too
angry to weigh her words, uttered the venomous
and sisterly insinuation.

"My dear," said Dulsie with just sufficient
spirit to give point, "better that than to
compound for sins you are inclined to, by
damning those you have no mind to."

But usually the sisters lived in tolerant
amity, and Sybella did not often lay herself
open to be so worsted by her own weapons.
Departed youth had left in Sybella seeds of
bitter regrets for misused matrimonial opportunities,
and slowly creeping-in age presented
only a jaundiced vista of the future. She did
not know it herself, poor woman, but gradually
even love of kin was chilliness in her embittered

o

heart.

There was, however, one affection, if so it
could be termed, which had become a ruling
passion, and that was family pride. She liked
the gay pretty Judy, and acquiesced in the
arrangement the squire had made, that, failing

direct heirs, the place and name should pass to
lier.

But it was a grief nevertheless that no male
Egbert should be left of the once many-branched
family tree. She dimly conceived ita
blot on the escutcheon.

It had, however, been a comfort to feel, as
she and her sisters settled down in resigned
spinsterhood, that only an Egbert would rule
during their time in the old place ; that if she
and her sisters had missed the crowning joy of
a woman's life, or, as some might think, had not
fulfilled the object of their creation, they had
over them no lord to call himself master of
Egbert Hall.

She was not naturally keener of perception
than Mabella, but she laid herself more out to
observe, till as a natural corollary supposition
and assumption became ingrained habits.

But though her perceptive capability was
sharpened, her power of acumen was not
broadened. A complex character was far
beyond her ken ; its weaknesses or salient
proclivities she might grasp, but nothing
more. From one narrow standpoint she made

her deductions, and by these she judged a
whole.

Little weaknesses had no chance of escape
from Sybella's notice. Naturally small of
soul she was gradually becoming mean of
spirit and an influence of insensible irritation
in her family circle.

Had Major Tyler selected Sybella instead
of Mabella as his quarry, it is more than
probable that her perceptive powers would
not, in his case, have made adverse deductions.
She was six years younger than
Mabella, and in the colour of her hair and
lightness of figure had still distinct remains of
a personable youth ; but Mabella was what
the Scotch call " sonsie," that is comely and
good-humoured, and, too, in a bargain of this
kind, the major contemplated her additional
years as a score in her favour  he looked
forward with equanimity to an early widower-hood.
Sybella's nose was long and tipped
with red, she was spare of person, and she
was not sympathetic. A " Tartar," he called
her to himself.

But he was grievously mistaken in his estimation

of Glabella. At present lie was
glamoured by his influence. She had always
been susceptible to the tender passion, but in
her youth not over constant. Xow that so
suddenly she had again succumbed to the
soft impeachment, with the usual contrariety
of human nature she gave evidence of a
dogged constancy, which promised effectually
to blind her acute intuition. Her family
pride, however, with which in even a greater
degree than Sybella she was imbued, retained
its normal conditions  a pure unreasoning
superstition, fierce almost in its nature  outside
and above every other consideration ot
life in her heart.

In the nature of events she knew that she
should succeed her father in the life-tenancy
of Egbert Hall ; he had told her so, and it
pleased her in thought to anticipate the
generous things she would have it in her
power to heap on the man of her choice ; but
that he should ever be master of the old hall
never entered into her speculations. A
doubt of his worthiness to stand by her side
as partner in her greatness  more than a

partnership she never in her tenderest imaginings
awarded him  not once crossed her
heart. It would be an hapless day for the
arch designer when the " foolish old woman,"
as he called her in his silent communing,
should know him as he was. Courteous and
kindly as the three Miss Egbertss were in their
manner, well dressed too, and refined in their
occupations, they had lived such an utterly
rural life, had mixed so little in the gay
world, that they were what that gay world
called old-fashioned. Their manner had not
the habit of society. The repressive conventionality
of modern society inhibits nature in
speech and emotion, degrades movement to
an art and attitude to a trick. Like the
outer heathen, its votaries carry their symbol
of caste on their faces, but not in peaceable
pigments ; their distinguishing marks are a
certain vacuity of expression and conformity
of line, as if in indication that they are a
peculiar people and not, like the vulgar herd,
made after God's image. This dumb shibboleth
was not written on the homely visages of
the Miss E-berts. Of louis descent and exalted

traditions, few within the aristocratic
ofuild had more definite claims to the distinction
of blue blood, few less to the significant
terms " high-bred and comme il faut' But
it sufficed for the bliss Egbertss that they were
Egbertss, and for their county, too.

Egbert Hall did not stand on a commanding
gf height ; it was situate in a hollow, where
it had once been surrounded by a moat, the
necessity for which means of defence in
troublous times had probably determined the
choice of site, as it was the only place on
the demesne where sufficient water could be
found to supply a moat. But the conduit
from which the water had come had long ago
been filled up and the water diverted into
another channel, thou:]i its boundary was still
marked by the stone arch which had at a
later period replaced the drawbridge, and by
the gate-houses, whose date, as cut over the
arched stone doorway, was 1380. The hall
was a large castellated structure of a quadrangular
form, erected in the reign of Edward
the Second, so that for more than five hundred
and fifty years it had braved time and tempest,

VOL. T. 11

and had been the silent witness of the fortunes
and misfortunes of the Egbertss. The exterior
had been little altered, but some of the
windows had been modernized and additional
doorways in the walls opened.

The height was generally two storeys, and
the whole structure was built of limestone.
The original windows had pointed arches, and
a battlement ran round and nearly concealed
the roof. A winding stair led from the basement
into many of the rooms, and also to the
outside of the roof, where it terminated at the
base of a very graceful turret. The west
front commanded the finest view of the
country and was flanked by four tall buttresses
extending up to the battlement. This
front was three storeys in height, except where
the chapel was situate, and there it was only
two. Various additions in intervening centuries
had been made to the house, but the
original style had been pretty closely observed,
though not the same solidity. The
roof was many gabled, slated, and with wide
leaded gutters. The view from the battlements
was extensive and over a fair and

fertile country, full of historic associations.


The interior retained many of its ancient
features, and the kitchen, vhich was spacious
but not lofty, had still the original arch of the
wide fireplace. The rooms on the same basement
also retained their original va ultima.
Above these was the great banqueting-hall,
a noble room, lighted on each side by two
large windows. It had been the pride of
successive Egbertss to preserve this hall with
no more than requisite change. The flooring
was recent, and the glass in the windows had
been replaced by other with the armorial
bearings and q quarterings of the family in rich
colouring. It was furnished with black oak
furniture and tapestry hangings ; with old
firearms, matchlocks, arquebuses and crossbows
; with spears, swords, sabres, pleases,
daggers, truncheons and shields, relics of
many a doughty warrior whose first breath
had been drawn within the venerable walls.
There were spoils of the chase, too, from
distant lands, rich furs, shining ivories and
fierce heads of beasts and fish. Here, too, hung

112

the family portraits of ancient date, grim
valour and gentle beauty, stern justice and
courtly grace. When the full sunshine
streamed in through the superb windows the
old hall showed with a stately grandeur,
worthy of the brave antecedents of the race
it had nursed ; but when it knew no light save
that of the pale moon and chilly stars, it was
a gruesome place, ghostly to the superstitious
and portentous to the timorous.

There was a projecting wing on the north
side of the great hall in which were now the
living rooms of the family These had been
partially modernized by late generations,
but the ceilings were low and in all the reception
rooms, save one bright little boudoir, the
walls were oak-panelled. The windows commanded
a wide prospect of undulating lands,
melting into the distant hills ; a great wood
belted the house in on the east, giving shelter
from the spring winds, and far away to the
south could be seen the broad river of Pell,
the outcome of the silvery stream by whose
banks Giles fed his flock.

The chapel, though carefully preserved

almost ill its entirety, was now seldom used,
but there, in the old crumbling font  so said
family traditions  every Egbert born under
the roof of the Hall had been christened, and
every Egbert who within its precincts had
shuffled off their mortal coil had laid in state in
its narrow chancel. There the sentinel tapers
kept watch and ward until the prescribed five
days had run, and the velvet palled coffin took
its place in the great vault outside the parish
church. The entrance door to the chapel from
the outside was under a pointed arch. It had
long since been closed up. It was only opened
on the occasion of a funeral of one of the
family, but since that of the present squire's
wife, an event now thirty years old, its rusty
locks and bars had remained undisturbed. A
broad path, though, which led round to the
front avenue from its very postern was kept
carefully trimmed and gravelled, for there
was an old superstition attached to the country
round that should a corpse be ever carried
through any path, that path could not be done
away with. Since the Reformation the Egbertss
had professed the Protestant faith, and the

family annals told of more than one brave
scion that had given his life for conscience
sake. That they had become Protestants from
conviction and not expediency was one reason
perhaps why the old chapel had fallen into
disuse, why also it had no relics to tell of its
once Popish habitude. In all the subsequent
mutations of the reformed church, of ecclesiastical
'isms and canonical doxies, of zeal and
lethargy, the head of the family had preserved
an even tenour, his simple creed that of its
unadorned ritual. And though on occasion
it would happen  notably on the presentments
of certain advowson in the gift of the
family  that a biblical bishop or sacerdotal
prelate would denounce him as heterodox,
none were ever found to accuse him of lukewarmness
: the Squire Egbert of the period
was ever a staunch, if a moderate. Churchman.
As yet, her possible heirship had been only
indirectly intimated to Judy, but when it definitely
presented itself to her mind, it seemed
such a far off and painful contingency that
she dismissed it once for all from her thoughts.
It had almost frightened her, in some such

way as a child would be frightened were a
cumbersome and dazzling bauble placed in
its hands. The place had been to her a playground
of infinite variety, the old Hall an
enchanted castle of Otranto. She loved the
inmates dearly, each in a different way. The
squire she reverenced, yet did not fear, and
year by year the little Egbert off-shoot, as he
called her, rooted herself deeper into his heart.
He had regarded her at the first as of necessity
his heir ; then her charm, her gaiety, her pretty
manners and delicate beauty, touched his pride ;
and her genuine commonsense seemed to the old
man almost a touch of genius, and her shrewd
remarks as the wisdom of Solomon. Full of
fun and frolic as she was, she could be grave
and sympathetic in his sad moods, to which he
was much inclined. At these times she would
walk quietly by his side and lead him insensibly
to talk of his dear dead wife ; of his son
he seldom spoke, his death had been too
sudden and tragic for the wound ever to heal
even enough to allow of the gentle touch of a
pitying hand. But not so with his wife. She
had gradually faded under his eyes, and when

her chair was vacant it seemed as if only a
shadow had risen from it to follow the bright
existence that had vanished so longs astound
as the years wore on and the time drew
nearer when he, too, should turn his face
heavenward, this loving retrospection became
to him as the converse about some one from
whom he had parted but yesterday, and so
gradually grew to be less a pain. \ya3 it
because in the tale of time his earthly vista
had shortened to a span, and he knew that
his lonely journey was near its close, or that
perhaps beyond that narrowed vista his longing
eyes had caught the " gleam of a Avhite
pinion spreading " in the faint glimmer of the
coming dawn ? Who can tell ? As earth
crumbles from us, things that are not appear
nearer than things that are, and life measured
by limited existences seems longer, for its very
weariness, than eternity.

Whene'er ye feel your honour grip,
Let that be aye your border."

The next morning at breakfast the squire
asked Judy if she were inclined for a very-long
ride. He wanted, he said, to see some
young stock at Marlby Grange, Lord Albany's,
distant about twelve miles, and he proposed
that they should start immediately after
luncheon and return in time for the seven
o'clock dinner.

Dulsie," he added, " has her hands full, I
know, and she will be glad to be left to
herself."

Judy agreed to the arrangement with
delight. She had never been to Marlby
Grange, but she had often heard of its
beauties and grandeur from her cousins, who
at the same time were always careful to add
that the house eras only two hundred years

old and the title a creation of the second
George's reign.

'' It is quite a made place, I may say,"
Mabella would add, "it grew with the fortunes
of the Albany, who were small gentry at
first."

Dulsie affirmed her father's statement that
her hands were full, and congratulated herself
that she had come to the Hall at this particular
juncture, when a flower-show was coming
off at Nettlethorp.

For you see, dear," addressing Jud} " it
would never have done if weaver had put
Parton in the shade ; I'd never have heard the
end of it."

Weaver was the squire's head gardener
and Parton was Dulsie's special functionary,
and as before mentioned the two were constantly
on the verge of open war, The
chance of Weaver putting his rival to the
blush had happened in this wise. As Dulsie
rejected from her conservatory common plants,
or plants she called common, it seemed almost
impossible that the two gardeners should
clash, but it appeared that Weaver, fired

by ambition, had cultivated in an ordinary
forcing house some cuttings of choice pears
given him by a friend. The season
was favourable, and the plants were this year
in great and vigorous beauty. There was to
be a flower-show at Net tie thorp, and Weaver
had obtained leave of the squire to exhibit
his treasures. Xow Parton had in the conservatory,
just moved from a greenhouse,
also some rare and exquisite pelargoniums,
against which he felt convinced nothing could
stand. He had no objection that Weaver
should exhibit flowers in his own line, such
flowers as owed their nurture to the open
air, but that he should dare to represent
Egbert Hall with greenhouse growths was
just a thing he would not stand, and if Miss
Dulsie didn't assert her proper position, which
in reality meant his, " he should transfer his
services to some one who could uphold, in a
proper manner, .proper floral dignity." This,
uttered respectfully, but resentfully, was the
pith of his appeal made on the previous
evening to Dulsie, and to which Dulsie had
yielded, induced by the favourable aspect of

the weather, but more by the fear of losing
a person who so thoroughly " understood the
constitution" of his charges.

She had therefore before her a good day's
work in writing notices, as she was all but
too late in entering, and in arranging the
modes of conveyance. It was so rarely that
Dulsie did exhibit, that the fuss of preparation
was always out of proportion to the
occasion.

There is a young Albany, Judy," and
Dulsie nodded and smiled.

"Yes," said the squire thoughtfully, "and
there's money wanted there, too." He spoke
with an arrive pense in his tone, and as if in
some way the subject was familiar to his
mind.

The old story, I suppose," observed
Dulsie ; " every succeeding generation of
Albany s has to ba set on its legs by an
heiress. A vast absorbing element in that
family."

Ah, you see," said Judy gravely, " heiresses
have peculiar privileges. I'm very glad I'm
not. an heiress."

Why?" asked the squire sharply.

Because no one who wants setting on his
leges will trouble me. I have rather a leaning
to sound constitutions."

Young Le Pole is a very sensible fellow,
and quite sound," said the squire, a little
inconsequently.

He has been thrush three London
seasons," added Dulsie, " without securing a
dol.' I am told he puts a high figure on
himself."

Seasoned goods, you see," laughed Judy,
he ought to try the States ; he'd get some
big offers there. Lords are at a high premium
with Brother Jonathan. They're the only
manufacture in which he can't compete with
us, so he sends us some of the raw material
for weft

And Sybella declares," said Dulsie, " that
in the interests of heraldry alone this invasion
of Yankee brides is serious ; they bring no
quarterings."

Ah, cousin Dulsie," Judy spoke sententiously,
"history repeats itself; it's not the
first time we got no quarter from the Yankees."

"Judy," cried the squire, laughing heartily
as he rose, and placing his hand on the young
girl's head, " come up to the battlements and
exhaust yourself. The lights and shades
to-day are marvellous, and there's not a sheaf
cut yet."

In a few minutes Judy returned with her
hat on.

We'll go up by the staircase here,"
she cried, " and come down by the great
hall," and she slung a small telescope she had
brought from the outer hall, where also she
had got her hat, round her neck.

"With a great sigh of rest and enchantment,
Judy brought up beside the squire on the
summit of the turret, disdaining the partial
view afforded by the embrasures in the battlements.


For some minutes neither spoke. The old
man's gaze wandered far away to the hills,
traveling along their ridges, till the highest
point reached he ceased to look on earth and
fixed his eyes on the light beyond.

Judy, a little subdued and more than a
shade graver, had turned her telescope in

search of her friend Giles. There in the
narrow hollow the sheep were feeding, dotted
hither and thither near ridges of security over
the surface of the rising round, down the side
of which the silvery stream ran dancing to
the placid river. Upon a distant down her
eyes lit on another flock packed close, rising
towards the ridge like a soft fleecy cloud
fallen from mid-heaven, slowly toiling back to
its place. Xow and then a little quiver of the
fleecy mass told her that Sam and Beck were
on duty and that Giles was not far off*. In a
little she caught a glimpse of a shadow-like
figure folio wins: the flock in the distance.
She could see him with his crook climbing
the ascent.

He's getting feeble," she thought; "even
the sheep are too fast for him now."

Slowly she brought her telescope round to
a commanding down, which the powerful lens
laid almost at her feet. She could see the
bees sail heavily-laden over the wild thyme,
and the bennet and the dry leaves shiver at
the rush of a fresh wave of the wind. Then
she followed with childish eagerness the whirling?

flioiit of two butterflies, till in their
gambols they fell foul of each other and
tumbled to the ground. Anon she traced the
sweep of a descending lark to see if she could
determine the spot where it would alight, but
it obliged with outstretched winsfs, shot forward,
and was lost to sight. At that momenta
flock, it seemed to her, of larks, sprung into
the air, paused to gather impetus, and in one
loud chorus, unheard bv her, burst into sono
and were lost in the blue dome.

Her telescope travelled downwards and
dwelt on others of less ambitious flight rising
but some eight or nine yards from the earth,
and floating forward on wide-spread wings,
but the low sweet note they uttered in this
gentle play could not reach her ear.

On a hifrh down were the remains of an
ancient earthwork, a grassy mound and earthworks,
and within its inclosure were withered
tufts of grass left untouched by the sheep. Judy
knew the place well. She swept her glass over
it to find, if she could, some of her sylvan
friends at home within their forms. The arched
grasses moved, and in and out she watched

the hares pass secure from alarms. Xow and
again one, as if struck by a sudden thought,
would rise on its hind legs and listen for a
second, then leisurely leap on its way. She
followed their tracks across the green till her
attention was arrested by two, weirdly erect,
indulging in a boxing-match. It was a merry
game. Found and round they went as if
waltzing  advancing and retreating, striking
with their fore legs with rapid action. At
last, struck by the absurdity of the combat,
Judv burst into a riuCTino- laugh, which had
the effect of rousing the squire from his
reverie.

Look, cousin Egbert," she cried, giving
him the telescope and adjusting the focus.

The squire laughed also. "I have often
stood," he said, " and watched them at their
gambols ; the rabbits, too  just a lower world
of children, without a thought of tomorrow.
The mere sense of living is to animals an
intense enjoyment, the intense perhaps because
their very existences are so fragile and
their enemies so many. But now, Judy, I
want you to follow me to another world, and

VOL. L 12

to give me all your attention. I brought you
up here for a purpose. Take the telescope
and put the focus right again."

She did so.

Now follow the line of wood beginning at
your left and curving gradually round the
hills. You have come to the Pell now."

Judy said she had.

Then bring up sharp by the pollards,
and follow me to the hollow where you seethe
sheep."

Giles is over the ridse of the down " she
said, " but most of the sheep are in the
hollow. I see them."

Leave them," he went on, " to your left
and trace the boundary wall  you know it 
at the far side of the cornfields till you come
to the cottages."

The obedient telescope stood still at the spot
indicated.

"You are at the conduit now, are you
not ? "

"Yes, cousin Egbert, or rather what was
the conduit."

Well, track the course of the sedges and

the green fosse  you know it by the ' novelty '
grass and herbage, the sure signs of underlying
water ; track till you come to the first
trees of the wood again, then you can see
without the glass."

What next ? " she asked.

"Put down the telescope and listen to me.
You have followed acre by acre the boundary
of what was once the Egbert demesne, a
sweep of twelve miles ; five now incloses all
that is left to our name. You know, Judy, I
am the last male of our line, and that when I
die women must succeed me, the first time a
woman has hired an Egbert."

Judy silently assented.

"I'm very near the top of the hill now,
Judy, and I want my mind to be at ease
about the old place. I used to be very proud
of it once ; I suppose I am still, or I should
not be disturbed about its future. Often and
often I've come up here alone and traced
and retraced the old boundary with vain
longings to call all within its magic ring ours
once more. And it might have been, child ; I
might have had my wish if I had chosen to

122

give my dead wife's seat to another, but I
could not. I think it would have been a sin,
Judy, for marriage was not instituted to
further mercenary contracts. I'm not a
sentimental man. Sybeha says I am. She,
and the others too, wanted me to marry
Harriet Le Pole, that is Miss Le Pole of the
Manor House, Lord Albany's aunt. She
owns all the lands within the boundary I
have shown you, all that is not ours still.
She inherited them from her mother, whose
family acquired them two centuries ago. It
is too long a story to tell you now, but it was
a Commonwealth job and the first time in
the history of the Egbertss that the property
had been divided. Miss Le Pole has never
married, and her natural heir is of course her
nephew the earl. He got the earldom from
the present administration  it was only a
barony before."

Judy faintly surmised her cousin's drift.

Now," he continued, " what passes between
us to-day is in confidence."

Judy nodded gravely. The squire was undemonstrative,
and she knew bis moods.

*' At my death the place will pass in succession
to my three daughters. At their death
it goes to you without any restriction whatever,
except that you and all who come after
you bear the name of Egbert."

Oh, cousin Egbert," that was all Judy
could say ; she felt frightened, grieved, and
shy. A delicate sense told her thanks would
be out of place, for thanks expressed gladness
in a manner, and how could she feel glad at
the prospect of a gift that entailed the death
of those she loved ? It did not occur to her
to depreciate herself, her nature was too open
for finesse ; neither did her usually ready tongue
prompt her to expressions of extravagant
appreciation of the honour intended her, or
florid pledges for the future. But the tone of
her " Oh, cousin Egbert," spoke to the squire's
heart all that that heart wanted. They understood
each other ; she had held out her hand
and he kept it close in his grasp as he went
on :

I have not given out that you are to bethe
eventual heiress, child, because I would not
have you a mark for fortune-hunters, and so I

4#

have not spoken to your mother either, for
she is ambitious, and you, dear, might suffer."

The little palm in his fluttered. The tenderness
of the old man gave to Judy's heart a
sense of pain.

"But if it should so chance, Judy  only
of chance now, not by my bringing about or
Sybella's managing  that you and young Le
Pole should like each other, will you promise
me that you will not throw any impediment
in the way to his choosing you for yourself,
for your own self, Judy, not for the few acres
of this old earth's crumbling crust your cousin
Egbert willed you to have ? "

Judy's tears were falling like pitiful rain,
but she did not speak, only once again she
said, " Oh, cousin Egbert."

The squire looked curiously into her downcast
face. This time the tone of the simple
words did not speak to his heart all that that
heart wanted. Struck by a sudden fear he
recoiled.

Judy," he said, dropping her hand, " Judy,
child, it's not Mabella's major ? "

For the third time Judv uttered the same

words, " Oh, cousin Egbert," and once more
the tone spoke to the squire's heart what that
heart desired. Then she burst into a ringing
laugh, stopping on the highest note to exclaim
with derisive merriment :

"Major Tyler!"

The next instant, as if in penitence, the
ready tears burst forth, and she Hung her
arms round the squire's neck and buried her
face in his breast.

' I didn't mean to hurt you, Judy, darling,"
he said simply. " You see, I know the world
so well, and these handsome militaires, particularly
when not too young, a year off forty
or so, are very insinuating. Indeed, dear, I
was afraid poor Mabella was going to be
foolish about him, she used to be always
falling in love loner ago."

Judy unwound her arms and dried her eyes.
Usually she had great command over her
emotions, but to-day she had been taken by
surprise in a very unfamiliar fashion.

He has gone away," she said, " and Mabella
does not seem to care much."

'* And I hope he'll stay away," added the

squire. There was a pause, and then he returned
to the charge. " I have your promise
? '' he said with an infliction of doubt in
his voice. "You won't put any impediment
in the way of young Le Pole if he should come
wooing ? " and he smiled almost coaxingly.

"Dear cousin Egbert, what impediment
could I put ? " she began.

Oh, I mean you won't be too sharp with
him ; he's not as clever with his tongue as you
are. And  and you won't flirt  you know
what I mean  with any one else ; you'll give
him a chance, won't you ? "

There was something inexpressibly touching
in the old man's deprecatory manner, in his
almost pleading tone. Judy's heart filled with
sympathetic pity and yearning. Only a little
word and a few kisses, that was all that was
wanted, and the squire would go gladly on his
way down the darkening vale. He would not
ask for pledges, she knew that ; her faintly,
whispered " yes " would be as a solemn vow
to him, for his faith in her utter truth was as
that of a little child in its mother.

And after all, why should she not let him

have the simple assurance he sought ? It was
only to give this as yet unknown youth a
chance, if he so minded to seek that chance ;
and  and she must not forget this, not to flirt
with any one else ; that meant not to listen to,
not to give any one else a chance, just to keep
herself passively open for the advances of this
young noble, whose great recommendation in
the squire's eyes was his imminent heirship of
the old Egbert lands.

She would wait until she had seen the youth,
and then she would answer her cousin. That
was a happy thought ; it gave her time. He
might take a sudden dislike to her, that would
spare her the onus of refusing the squire's
request ; or she might to him, and then she
would find it less difficult to disappoint cousin

Robert.



In any case she would have time to think
over the matter, and somehow, if you did not
fuss and worry  so Dulsie always said  things
righted themselves, and the result would be
just the same. She had almost forgotten that
the squire was beside her, patiently waiting
her answer.

Her little hands were clasped before lier,
and Iter eyes looked wistfully out on the
sunlit hills, almost as if expectant of aid in her
strait. Her soft mouth had a line of care, and
the smooth brow showed more than one
wrinkle. Then, prompted by an undefined
impulse, with absent action she raised the
telescope and once more levelled it at the fair
lands beneath, at the meadows green with
aftermath, at the fields of golden grain, over
which went " waves of shadow," at the wood
on the east with its undulating line of treetops
quivering beneath the rays of the sun
rising to its meridian, at the silvery Pell, and
so on to the peaceful hollow and the quiet
sheep.

Judy," whispered the squire, " it may all
be yours."

Down fell the telescope, and again in
an impulsive significant tone she uttered
for the fourth time the words, " Oh, cousin
Egbert ! " then, before he could add a word,
she seized his hand with both of hers and
said, stopping now and again, when she
feared she gave pain, to lay on it a kiss

of penitence, '' Oh, cousin Egbert, you can't
think so meanly of me as to imagine that
I was appraising the promised land "  she
smiled through the fast-oratherinor tears 
that I was weighing it in the balance
against the promise you would have of me ?
I thought you knew me ; but you know, dear,
don't you, that I never told you a lie ? "

Judy used honest words when greatly in
earnest. It was the squire's turn to kiss the
small firm hand.

I thought so ; but I want you now, darling,
to understand that I would not even trifle with
the direct truth. Cousin Egbert, just for a
flash it seemed possible to me to speak the
truth and yet give you the pledge you asked.
I thought I could easily promise not to
flirt ; ' you mean that I am not to let anyone
else woo me  that's a good, old, plain-meaning
word, and so it suits me  that I am
to keep myself in every way free for Lord Le
Pole only ; that is what you want of me ? Xo,
dear"  another kiss on the brown hand 
*' don't please explain away. We're in a very
solemn place, above earth as it were, with only

the blue sky overhead, and the great eyeless
sun-watchings us. We're standing under the
Egbert flag."

She posted upward to the top of the tall
staff from which the gay pennant flaunted m
the lioht breeze.

I think if I played you false it would curl
itself round the pole and never wave again.
I cannot give sou this promise."

The eloquent blood rushed to her face as,
to veil her eyes, she bent lower than before
and leant her brow on her clasped hands.
There was a painful pause, broken at last by
the squire. He spoke in a constrained voice,
with a tremor, but gently and lovingly
withal.

Xever mind, child, it was but an old man's
whim. It was only while you were fancy free
I asked it of you ; " and then he withdrew his
hand from her keeping and laid it gently on
her head, saying, " God bless you, Judy dear ;
the old name is safe in your keeping, and when
the time comes that you are no longer fancy
free, may God give you the desire of your
heart, for I know you will not choose unworthily.

But, child, do not let idle dreams
possess your soul ; the waking will be rough,
and pain you. I shall never come up here
again, never look on that wide boundary
more. God's best gifts are often denials."

Life might never have for Judy a more
anguished moment, or subject her brave true
spirit to a more crucial test.

Each word of the old squire stabbed her to
the quick, for she was young and tender, andover
her vital emotions time's crust was yet
thin.

A weaker nature would have yielded ta
its affections ; the request in itself seemed
such a very little thing, sophistry whispered,
and did not entail any binding pledge in the
future.

But Judy's nature was not weak, or she had
not felt so keenly. She wept though, what
stern souls would have called, weak tears, they
fell so plentifully, and in her turmoil of soul
she felt that there was yet one word she must
speak ; she had hoped the squire would have
understood that unspoken word. Even in
her dumb pain she wondered at his blindness.

But she must give it voice now, or  so
clearly she reasoned  in a little while, when
the first sharpness of his disappointment had
softened, he might begin to hope again and
say to himself that while she was fancy free
there was a chance for him still. So she did
not falter or temporize.

She raised her sweet eyes, lustrous with
tears, in which in the sunlight stars seemed
to come and go, and with a vain effort to
steady her voice said :

But, cousin Egbert, I am not fancy
free."

Her confession made, as if in very shame
her head again dropped. So often it is that
the victory won, the brave spirit quails before
its own deed.

But somehow, although unknown to himself
a latent hope may have lurked in the
squire's heart, the bitterness of disappointment
had passed.

And now, though the simple words were
a revelation and made him start, they
brought no added pain, only a consciousness
that suddenly in the place of his little gay

friend Judy, a noble woman stood, the same
and not the same.

He took her hands and kissed her downcast
face with a quiet reverence.

Is it so ? " he said ; " you will tell me all
about it in your own good time, dear ; to
doubt you, would be to doubt goodness itself.
And Judy," he went on, for the tears still
fell, " don't fret about disappointing cousin
Egbert; not to sweep the Egbert boundary
round the whole county would I have had
you cross the boundary-line of honour. Do
you remember the summer nio'ht last year in
the old banqueting-hall when we all amused
ourselves by choosing chivalric mottoes, and
you chose for yours the words of the Scotch
poet Burns :

' V'here'er you feel your honour grip,
Let that be aye your border ? ' "

Judy smiled remembrance, as her weeping
ceased.

And, Judy, just as you looked then in
your white frock, standing in the moonlight
so grave and earnest when we all laughed,
you look now, when, true to your chosen

motto, you toppled over the old man's castle
in the air."

She looked up still ruefully, but there was
no pain in the squire's eyes, only a great love
and peace. They then kissed each other in
silence and turned homewards.

As they issued from the banqueting-hall to
reach the dining-room bv the honos corridor,
Judy said, smiling, the squire thought, sadly :

Cousin Egbert, do you think the day of
real chivalry will ever come, when to be simply
natural will only be to be simply true ? "

"Yes, dear," he replied, " but not here."

Soft words, with something in them, make a song."

The confidences on the turret had left such
a disturbing element in Judy's mind, that
but for the seductive attraction of a gallop on
Gloriana she would have evaded the visit to
Marlby Grange.

With Gloriana, however, as a decoy, the
visit gradually resolved itself into a duty
to her cousin and her delicate scruples into
self-conscious prudery; so faultlessly turned
out in a short dark blue habit, well-poised
top-hat, under which her hair appeared ina
shining coil, and a very fiction of a whip,
she tripped down the broad stone stairs and
mounted her impatient horse.

By the advice of Peters the squire had
elected to ride on this occasion his brown cob,
well known for its splendid trotting powers
and steady stay.

VOL. I. 13

He can take care of himself, can Bob,"
Peters had urged ; " and you'll want to keep
close to miss, and have your eyes sharp, 30 u
will ;" hints the squire appreciated thoroughly

It was a ride long to be remembered by
the gay Judy and grave squire. Gloriana
deported herself, as his mistress afterwards
assured Peters, " like an angel ; " as the
squire said, " like St. Vitus himself." Her
light canter was a succession of playful jumps
and surveying, Which seemed like arch
raillery of the sober Bob's short swift trot.

There had been rain recently, and the turfy
side of the liifrh road was cool and soft to the
horses' feet ; the arching branches of the trees,
too, gave shade from the sun, which shone
prone from a cloudless sky.

Only once they drew rein, and that was
perforce at a toll.

Then Judy had the grace to ask her cousin
if he where tired and would like a slower pace
for a while.

He looked at his watch and said smilingly,
Not so bad for Bob, seven miles in fifty-five
minutes."

Just half way," replied Judy. '' We'd
better walk the next mile, Bob's too fat."

With a little coaxing and gentle manipulation,
Gloriana reduced her airy prancing to
airy trappings, and Bob, nothing loth, brought
his sharp trot to a quick determined step,
which kept ]pace with his ambitious companion's
lighter movement.

The squire sat loosely, his reins slack and
his head bent. He was thinking. Judy eyed
him uneasily and a little remorsefully, but
Gloriana kept her on the alert.

There was no room for sentiment; there
was, however, for discursive chat, and Judy
loved erratic converse.

To urge the squire out of himself, as she
mentally intended, she said, taking advantage
of a meek mood of Gloriana :

Cousin Egbert, did I tell you that Mrs.
Beaumorris has a rival at Sandycot ? "

Neo, Judy, you did not," answered the
squire smiling ; " tell me all about it ; you're
the queen of gossips."

You know the Trelawneys, don't you ? "
she asked.

132

I know one family of that name, but
there are Trelawneys and Trelawneys. The
name is widely represented now."

This is an Admiral James Trelawney, an
old man of seventy at least."

*' Cornish?"

No, Sybella asked him, and he said he belonged
to a distant branch of the ' old stock,'
and that he was born at sea. That was all
the account of himself he vouchsafed. However,
his wife's pedigree is distinct enough.
She was a Fitzmure of Fitzmureland, but she
hadn't a penny, and her father hadn't an acre.
The old property was gambled away a century
ago, but the head of the family always kept the
old designation up. Sybella says the people
who have the property now gave it their own
name, and it is now Fitzmytheland  an ingenious
way of accounting for the patronymic
of Smith."

As how? " The squire looked mystified.

Oh, you see their name was Smith. They

owned by purchase a farm and some land

besides. They built a fine house and called

the place Sutherland. Wasn't it a stroke of

genius dropping the ' i ' ? And so when they
got Fitzmureland the transposition was easy.
I admire ingenuity."

So do I," said the squire, and he laughed.
Jud} laughed also then.

"Well, it's Sybella's ingenuity, not mine,"
she said. " In any case the name of the
place now is Fitzmureland ; not inappropriate,
is it ? It will be in ' Burke's Landed Gentry '
some day."

Did the family drop the ' S ' from their
name too ? "

Yes ; they're Myths now. Some of them
have made good marriages. When the family
tree is enough grown to exhibit, that little
transaction will read something like this :
'Mortimer Smith, son of Grosvenor Smith,
eminent ship-owner '  there's an ancestry in
ships  'and descendant through a collateral
branch of the ancient family of Smith-smythe,
obtained a patent for incorporating
the ancient lands of Fitzmureland and Smith-land
into one entire barony, to be designated
by the name of Fitzmytheland.' That's be
about it." And Judy laughed such a merry

peal, to which the squire added a hearty-bass,
that Gloriana flung up her head and
swung out in a dashing trot. They were within
two miles of their destination before the
mettlesome animal condescended to return to
the only approximation to a walk she vouchsafed
when Judy was at the helm  a light
tripping step.

Judy," said the squire, taking up the
thread the mare's impetuosity had snapped,
you are a little Eadical, I fear. I wonder
who your Gamaliel is."

Judy blushed. In the sunlight, on her
slightly averted face 

. the lily and the rose
For mastership did strive."

And the rose had the best of it, but she gave
her head a little toss and answered :

I have my own opinions, cousin Egbert.
I sit at no one's feet. I am not a bit of
a Eadical in a levelling sense, but I do hate
shams, and half the pedigrees in that great
tome of gentry are shams."

Sweeping, rather," said the squire archly.

but youth is sweeping and comprehensive ;
young folks hate details. They are magnificent
generalizers and gallant jumpers to conclusions."


I was telling you," said Judy, to lead her
cousin back to their starting point, "about
Mrs. Beaumorris's rival, Mrs. Trelawney. She
is so handsome, not a bit like Creamy, as
Mrs. Horseman calls her ; a fine tall, dashing
woman, very fair, full of fun and what you
would call devilment  just a Gloriana in fact."

"I don't care for very tall women," observed
the squire, " unless they are soft and
gentle. A tall fine woman sounds bold."

Oh, she's not a bit bold. She's half Irish,
you know, and can't help her spirits ; but I'm
afraid she is a born flirt. The poor little
admiral knows it too, but I've no pity for
him ; he must have married her from pure
]pride, just to show her off and make younger
men envy him. Poor old goose ! I suspecta
great many are very much obliged to him ;
they like flirtations that don't compromise  I
mean where no climax is expected in the way
of matrimony  and then you see women of the

-world like Mrs. Trelawney know low far to
go. They're the very material, Xed says,
'poiir passer le temps with."

"I'm afraid Xed, as you call him, is a
Eadical," said the squire slyly.

Judy looked round sharply, a little abashed.
"I should have said Mr. Eawson," she half
whispered. Then in her natural voice of light
gaiety, " Don't you think horse-flesh catching
? I always feel just a little fast in the
saddle. But oh, cousin Egbert, if you only
saw the beauties together ! They each put on
a spurt. Creamy languishes and poses and
does oriental sunrise and sunset, as Xed  Mr.
Eawson  says, ' to bewilderment.' That is,"
answering the squire's look of inquiry, " she
opens her eyes with a flash, and just when her
victim is dazzled to giddiness she lets down
her lids and he's all in the dark. The ' admiral's
craft,' as Xed calls her " (Judy was off
the rails now), " sees it all, and doesn't she
take the wind out of Creamy's sails ? I was
standing beside them on the pier one night ;
there was quite a little group, and somehow
the conversation drifted into marrying for

love. Mrs. Beaumorris sighed with her lids
down, and then suddenly flashing them open
she said, ' A true woman could never marry
for anything else.' The admiral was standing
close to his wife, a poor weather-beaten little
fellow, pompous and acid ; it was plain no
one could ever have married him for love.
Every one felt uncomfortable, every one but
the one whom the shaft was aimed at, and
she laughed  you should have heard her,"
and Judy stopped to laugh in sympathy.
We all laughed, too ; we couldn't help it,
though we hardly knew at what, and then,
putting her hand on the admiral's shoulder 
he only comes up to hers  she said, ' Jonas,
dear, didn't I marry you for love ? ' Oh,
cousin Egbert, if you could have heard her
voice, all of a sudden as soft and beguiling as
Creamy's ! She was mimicking her, I know.
You said you did,' he answered with a spit
like a toad. ' And don't I get what I married
for ? ' looking at the gentlemen from under
the corner of her eyes, which were brimful of
fun. They all took off their hats, and Ned
added, ' I should think you did ; good measure.

running over.' Then the admiral fired off a
feeble joke. 'She gave me double measure, I
know,' he said, ' for she only got a tar in me,
and I a Tartar in her.' "

Again the squire laughed. " Now, Judy,
pull up," he said. " Keep a little fizz for old
Albany."

Then, the gates sighted, the groom trotted
briskly up and rang the postern bell, and ina
few minutes the cob and Gloriana trotted
gaily up the great avenue, arched over by
interlacing elms and bordered by high embankments
of mossy turf.

The approach was nearly a mile in length,
as it wound with the tortuous river. Seen at
intervals through the lace work of green foliage
the house was pretentious and imposing,
but though it bore date of two centuries
back it had no look of the antique. The
facade had richly ornamented Corinthian
pillars, and on each side a handsome flight of
stone steps led to the entrance door, which
opened into an outer hall or vestibule, richly
dim with stained oflass windows bearing the
Albany arms and quarterings. There were

no turrets or battlements as at Egbert Hall,
but the architecture was altogether more distinctly
of a period, and regular.

It might have been evident to a professional
eye that the idea had been to impart an
appearance of the antique, which had not
been successful. As a dwelling it was much
more conveniently commodious than the
venerable pile of the Egbertss. The ceilings
of the living rooms, too, were lofty and the
banquet-hall a pleasant and lifelike chamber.
The walls of this gay hall were hung with
the family portraits, but though there were
ermine-robed peers, many medalled heroes,
and fat and well-looking lawn-sleeved church
dignitaries, cavaliers also with rakish lovelocks,
and more than one counts-palatine,
there were none of the crusaders of the grand
days of chivalry, of Plant agents and Tutors,
that graced the venerable walls of the great
banqueting-chamber of Egbert Hall. The
site of the house was on rising ground, sunny
and open, and if with no historic memories to
boast of, a pleasant, luxurious home withal,
fitting housing for a peer or a millionaire.

Judy was a neophyte in the great world.
She had seen grander places than Egbert Hall,
for she had been used to accompany her
cousins on their formal visits in the county,
but on these occasions she had remained in
the carriage and had sighted the grandeur
and circumstance from the outside only. She
was to-day not a little subdued and serious
as she followed the squire up the stairs and
stood before the massive door which gave
entrance to the many-hued vestibule. There
were only the old lord and a married daughter
at home, besides his elder son, Lord Le Pole.
The rest of the pretty numerous family were
in London. Lord Albany was in expectation
of the squire, but Judy was a pleasing surprise.


We are keeping house together." said
the squire, as he introduced the blushing girl
to the somewhat stiff nobleman, who however
relaxed graciously, if not with empressement, to
his pretty, graceful visitor, who returned his
kind greeting with a shy look and a timid
curtsey. There might have been a faint
deprecatory glance in Judy's eyes, shot from

her consciousness, an imperceptible evidence
of self-reproach in her slight obeisance, as the
remembrance of the morning's occurrence
momentarily recurred to her. Judy shrank
from giving pain, and disappointment she knew
was pain. She thought too that the stately old
nobleman's face showed lines of care, and asher
tender heart was touched with pity, she
was conscious of a strange feeling of impatience
at the unsought for responsibilities which had
been so suddenly, as it were, thrust upon her.
A fretful shade slightly clouded her brow, and
a grave look gave just a tinge of questioning
thought, rather than of sadness, to her usually
mirthful eyes.

My daughter. Lady Margaret Dredger,"
said Lord Albany, as a small and rather
common-looking woman entered from a side
door. By her side was a little boy, clinging
to her skirts  a little chubby-faced, curly-headed
urchin of about four summers, attired
in a sailor costume of white duck bordered
with blue.

*' Miss Aylmere, of Egbert Hall," he added,
with a slight tone of reminder in his voice.

Lady Margaret with a start came up to Judy
and shook hands with her, with, that young
lady thought, not a little unnecessary cordiality.
Judy detested gush.

Ormsby, dear," said Lady Margaret to the
child, "give this pretty lady a kiss," which
after a minute's scrutiny of Judy's face Master
Ormsby did.

What is or name ? My popper name is
Cricket," he said ; immediately adding, as he
put out his hand with a confiding action for
his new friend to take, " Me like oo."

Judy stuck her fairy whip in a button-hole
and lifted the child from the ground.

M} name is Judy," she said, accompanying
the information with a perfect shower of
kisses.

Oh stop, please, what prodigal waste 
there'll be none for any one else," cried a
strange voice.

Judy set the little fellow, who was slight of
make, on her arm, and looked in the direction
of the open door, whence the words seemed to
issue.

My son," said Lord Albany, who with the

squire was in the act of leaving the room for
the purpose of inspecting some stock on the
home farm, the ostensible object in fact of the
latter's visit, and turning back he introduced
the individual in question with considerable
significance to Judy.

<TMri

A proper man as we shall see in a summer's day."

With her rather demonstrative burden, whose
arms were round her neck, Judy could only
give a slight inclination of the head to the
new arrival. Her cheeks glowed, and she was
conscious of feeling utterly missis and rustic.
A glance had given her keen perceptibility a
pretty accurate rendering of the outer and
inner man of the heir to Marlby Grange, as
on the surface he presented himself.

A dawdling dandy," she thought, " walking
as yet with aimless feet, handsome though,
and with the air of a thorough-bred." She
felt at once a little drawn to him, but her
very shyness compelled her to assert her
composure, and the inkling she had gathered
of the latent designs on her as a well-endowed
heiress prompted her to impress them with
her perfect indifference and independence.

So after her bow, converted into a nod by a
hug from Master Ormsby, or the Cricket ashe
was generally called, she returned to the
child and called him an arch little flirt.

"I wish I could be Ormsby for just five
minutes," said Lord Le Pole softly.

Judy took no notice. She had sat down,
and the child, apparently fascinated with his
new acquaintance, was stroking her face with
his little dimpled hands.

Have 00 a little boy, too ? " he asked,
staring intently into her starlike eyes.

She shook her head laughing.

Cause I see 'little boys in oose eyes," he
added gravely.

Ormsby sees himself," she said ; " eyes are
like looking-glasses sometimes."

o o

May I see if I am there, too ?" asked Lord
Le Pole, " or is it a question of privilege ? "

Judy laughed. The sound of her voice in
its natural element of mirth restored her self-possession,
and she looked quickly round in
the direction of Lady Margaret, who was
presiding at a little tea-table with a dainty
service of exquisite china, and said :

VOL. I. 14

I should like to run off with him for the
week. I am at Egbert Hall. Cousin Dulsie
is very fond of children."

Lady Margaret shook her head.

*' He's not very strong for all his rosy
cheeks," she said, " and he is a precious littk
pickle."

Will you try a substitute," again put in
Lord Le Pole. This time his sister laughed.

Will you give Miss Aylmere some tea,
Le Pole ? " she said, holding out a cup full of
the fragrant beverage. " Tea and Cricket

D O

won't do together, Miss Aylmere," she added ;
put him down, he mustn't be troublesome."

But Cricket had been foraCTino. He had
got his hand into the small pocket where
Judy kept her handkerchief and had found a
lump of sugar.

Look ! " he cried, as he held it up in
triumph to his uncle, who had put the cup
down and was evidently bent on dethroning
the small usurper, an intention which was
frustrated by the sudden abdication of the
minute individual himself. "Look!" he repeated,
and then popped the lump into his

mouth, scrambled down, and placed himself in
ambush under his mother's skirts.

I suppose sugar is your natural food,"
drawled Lord Le Pole as he brought Judy
her tea. " I wish I were a iollypop. Don't
you think I would make a nice one ? "

Judy's eyes turned as they slowly traversed
the young man's person with an appraising
look.

No," she said at last, ' only syllabub."

Perfectly unruffled, but with evident amusement,
he gave the retort courteous in the same
languid voice.

And you ? "

Oh, something candied," she answered, as
if to atone for her sharp wit by turning it on
herself.

No, manna," he whispered. " It is
heavenly ! "

Compliments in any guise ruffled Judy, and
perhaps the insouciant young man might have
fared a little roughly at her hands had not
the small child, Ormsby, suddenly presented
himself and tendered a miniature sugar-basin
for her to make good his petty larceny.

142

Take a big one," lie said magnanimously.
Judy obeyed his bidding and paid him with
a kiss.

Then Lady Margaret proposed a stroll in
the grounds, to which Judy gladly assented.

"Ah  h  not a bad move," said Lord Le
Pole ; " haven't been out to-day ; too hot for
anything so vigorous as walking," and he led
the way to a door which opened direct on the
hall.

No, this way, Je Pole," cried his sister ;
we'll go out through the billiard-room ; Miss
Aylmere would like to see the flowers, I'm
sure."

Lady Margaret was a good strategist. The
route she indicated led through the entire
superb suite of rooms which occupied the
front and two sides of the house  a bewildering
progress to the simple Judy. Even the
Cricket was oppressed by their magnificence
and kept close to his mother's side. The
principal drawing-rooms were encased in
brown holland, so was also the vaulted
music-room, and in part the banquet-chamber.
The orildinss were somewhat

faded, and Judy could see that the designs
of the furniture were of the formal period,
now superseded by the grotesque, the fantastic,
the aesthetic, and what affections of
the archaic are pleased to term the Renaissance,
but of what, they do not always
condescend to define. The chairs were insets,
so also were the lounges and tables.
The carpets had not been rolled up as yet,
and these were rich crimson velvet pile, with
gay bordering, but in the line of traffic and in
the middle slightly worn and faded. On state
occasions fancy rugs of oriental fabric covered
the ravages of time. The painted panelling
of the walls  groups of flowers and sylvan
deities  had a look of yesterday's bouquet,
the bloom gone and the colours fading.

"You see us en papillote'' Lady Margaret
said ; " the little room you found us in is the
afternoon tea-room, and the one papa uses
when he is here en gascon'

A little room ! " thought Judy. " Why it
is nearly as large as the great drawing-room
at Egbert Hall ; no wonder they want a succession
of heiresses."

I think," she said aloud, feeling called
upon to make some observation, but too well
bred to either remark aloud or ask questions
in the manner of one going through a show
place attended by a cicerone, " I think
Ormsby is wise to keep close to us ; if he
were lost here lie would not be easily found
again."

Ah  h  I see we are kindred souls,"
drawled Lord Le Pole, " vastness wearies me,
too. You must see my retreat. Just room
for two and quite up to date  as Dredger
would say  which he declares this labyrinth
of immensity is not." Mr. Dredger was Lady
Margaret's husband, a retired and wealthy
stock-broker, with a mania for bric-d-brac
and an authority on art furniture.

"Xever mind," retorted Lady Margaret
good-humouredly ; she was proof against
shafts at her " city partner," as her husband
was called in the family. " When your time
comes and you set about refurnishing, you'll
be very glad of Adam's help. He has ideas."

Eight, Mary, but it's only Dredgers can
afibrd ideas. They can cultivate Morasses,

and ridicule nature with impunity. Fortunately
for the family purse I prefer time-hallowed
"  drawling out his words 
*' fashions."

At the far end of the great drawing-room
which closed the reception suite, double glass
folding doors opened into the conservatory.
This formed one side of the house and faced
south. The shading blinds had been drawn
up, and the rays of the sun, mellowed from
the west, lit up the windows with ruddy
sheen. A perfect bewilderment of colour
burst on Judy's sight, arched in by swaying
festoons of rare jasmine and fragrant stephanotis
and trailing branches of the white and
the crimson passion flowers, with here and
there, in light flakes, deep blue and snow-white
convolvuli.

How beautiful ! " was all she could utter.

Perpetual Renaissance here," whispered
Lord Le Pole.

The best pelargoniums have been set
aside for the show," observed Lady Margaret
; " Miss Egbert seldom exhibits now, I
suppose ? "

She is sending some pelargoniums this
time," answered Judy.

" Do you hear that, Dicks ? " cried Le Pole
to the gardener, "Miss Egbert is going to
exhibit too."

Then I maun be content with second, my
lord," was the reply, " but I think this will
rin her close," and Dicks lifted forward a low-sized
but splendidly-blossomed plant, as yet
not in full flower.

Only one of the blooms was perfect, and
showed a rare tint of golden-red, shaded to a
pale hue of gold at the edge, which was heavily
fringed and curled outwards. Judy clasped
her hands in ecstasy, and Lord Le Pole was
roused to honest and ardent admiration.
Lady Margaret exclaimed with surprise, and
the Cricket demanded to be held up that he
might " mell de rose "  all flowers were roses
to Ormsby as yet.

I haven't hit on a name, my lady," was
Dicks' reply to Lady Margaret. "There's a
Sunrise and a Sunset already ; what do ye
think of Phoebus ? "

"Oh, call it Gloriana," cried Judy; "it's

the same colour shaded off to golden sunlight."



Judy had to explain who Gloriana was,
which she did, a little abashed at her own
boldness, adding :

She's going to the show, and Peters says
she is sure of the medal, so she will bring you
luck."

What will Miss Egbert say ? " asked Lord
Le Pole.

Oh, she would be the first to place it first
if she thought it deserved it," she answered ;
cousin Dulsie is not small."

"I like the name real well, Miss," said
Dicks, " it sounds grand-like."

Dicks was a Scotchman. And Gloriana the
geranium was named.

Judy had to take a hasty survey with Dicks
of a few of his special prides. She felt, she
told the squire afterwards, as if she had woke
in the garden of Eden and was gliding on a
rainbow. Then into the fernery and so through
a side door embowered in Cape jasmine and
clematis into a small ante-room devoted to
hardy green plants, with a fountain playing

in the centre and gold-fish gleaming beneath ;
a cool and restful retreat for the eye dazzled
by the garish brilliance of culture's triumph
over nature. Double doors, kept open in the
summer, gave entrance to the aviary, stocked
with home and foreign birds of sweet song
and rich plumage.

Fain would Judy have lingered and chattered
her bird language to the pretty inmates,
who, accustomed to the human form divine,
scarce moved a feather as she passed from
one wired division to the other. It was their
bedtime. The bright wings were folded, and
among chirrup and twitter they were settling
down to rest.

'what are your favourite bird and flower?"
asked Lord Le Pole in a tone of inviting
confidence.

Judy turned a quizzical look on him. She
was always ready to tilt at sentiment, which
she called sham.

My affections are far too impartial for a
confession album," she said ; " I'm a very
commonplace young person. I love wildflowers
and wild birds best."

He looked at her with an amused expression,
as one might look at a saucy child.

"Not without art, but yet to nature true ;"
and he smiled, Judy thought, a smile of
condescending approval.

There are few things more irritating to the
person at whom it is levelled than an apt
quotation  a truth Judy experienced. She
was in part aware of an aggressive feeling
from their first encounter towards this languid
iiLSOuciant young man, a feeling born of her
cousin's revelations of the morning ; and yet
she could not tell why, so subtle are the
workings of the heart, she felt impelled
towards him, and her ready retorts at fault.
Only in a blind way she was cognizant of
those internal monitions, but she was painfully
conscious of a suspicion that she had
given warrant to be set down as a social
failure. It was on her tongue to tell her
disquieting companion that she only loved
things with which she was familiar, and that
she knew wild birds and flowers best, but she
checked her utterance with prideful dignity.

I am not going to explain myself," she

said in lier heart ; " anything natural is a
curios to him." And then she wondered what
the room he called the Retreat was like ;
luxurious and artificial," she supposed, " the
ideal of a young man of the period."

Returning to the fernery they issued by
double doors of glass, corresponding to those
that gave entrance to the conservatory, into
the library, a conventional room in red
leather, with an orthodox and voluminous
collection of literature in the usual bookcases
; busts, and appropriate conveniences for
study in science and art. A pretentious, unfamiliar
room, Judy thought, the very books
looking as if they could never be more than
stiff acquaintances. Silently she traversed its
length, feehnof relieved when she found herself
in a cheerful room, next in order, known
as the old hall. There were two handsome
pillars in the centre ; the furniture, partially
draped, was oriental in its character
and the walls were covered with china. This
finished up the lengthy communicating suite,
a massive door facing the pillars giving egress
without to a lawn-tennis ground. Lady

Margaret opened the door, but her brother
said :

"We'll go through the billiard-room,
Mary ; I want to show Miss Aylmere my
retreat."

Judy was not a little curious.

Do you play ? " Lord Le Pole asked as he
took up a cue and made a cannon.

xi little with cousin Egbert."

He offered her a cue.

I could not trust myself," she said as she
passed on. "It is a very enticing game."

Just one stroke."

She retraced her steps laughing, and entering
into the spirit of the moment took the
offered cue, and with the firm pose of an
accustomed player bent to her aim and made
with easy effort a double cannon.

Not another stroke," she cried, " that was
a fluke."

The light grace of the girl as she bent to
the table, and the careless skill of her stroke,
drew from the young man a hearty " Bravo ! "
and a warm look of admiration.

It is getting late," said his sister, who had

marked with inner satisfaction the deepening
impression made by the heiress on her usually
indifferent and supercilious brother.

We'll have a battle royal some day," he
said, as he took out a small golden key and
opened a door in the wall that had all the
appearance of a panel.

Judy had been prepared for an array of
meerschaums if not clays, of sporting paraphernalia,
trophies of field and mere, and
racing literature.

What was her surprise to see a small well-proportioned
chamber, plainly but comfortably
fitted up with camp furniture, and in an
alcove, a hammock. The light was subdued
by crimson blinds and shading curtains of
muslin. The walls were fitted with shelves,
with here and there a space filled in by a
picture, and literally crowded with books.
On a table in one window was a microscope,
and in another, which looked north, an easel
and an unfinished painting. A small deal-cased
pianoforte stood well out from the wall,
and at the other end a harmonium, near
which was a stand laden with music. In one

corner of the room was a rifle, in another
a fishing-rod and creel.

A minute or so Judy stood in the window
beside the easel, a tumult of strange thoughts
in her brain.

"And this is the man I judged," she said
to herself. " This is the careless dandy on
the look-out for a well-dowered bride to
rehabilitate his pretentious home ! "

There was a touch of deference in her
manner as she asked him if he painted from
nature; she hardly knew she had spoken.

He replied he did, and then he said :

What do you think of the wild beast's
lair ? "

Her eyes were scanning the book-shelves.

All my own favourites," she half whispered,
so intent on her scrutiny she did not
notice that the young man's head looked over
her shoulder. Down the rows her eyes
travelled till they came to works on art,
tomes on science, and stately classics with
marks of honourable usage.

With a great sigh she turned fairly round
and said, just a little warmly :

"A lair, indeed! It's just the snuggest
little beehive I ever saw."

I call it the Hermitage," added Lady
Margaret; " it spoils him for society."

Do you think so ? " he asked in a confidential
whisper.

She blushed, and then as if angry at her
mauvaise honte, and not a little brusquely,
she said as she walked towards the pianoforte :

"I've only begun to come out, so I'm no
judge, but if this sort of thing," casting a
warm appreciating glance round, " unfits
people for society, I think I'll go in again."

Who ever loved that loved not at first sight ? "

Lady Margaret laughed and opened the
outer door on to the lawn-tennis ground, but
again, and this time at the instance of the
Cricket, her egress was delayed. That enterprising
juvenile had reached the pianoforte
before Judy, and with some loose and flying
leaves of music in his clutch was perched on
the music-stool.

Trew (screw) me up," was the imperious
order. Judy obediently brought him by that
giddy process to the level of the key-board,
when he got on his knees and fluttered the
leaves on to the ground.

Now Uncle Leppo, ting," he cried.

You young Philistine," cried his relative,
as he stooped to pick up some of the pages
which had fallen ; " why, it's my ' Israel in
Egypt.' "

VOL. I. 15

Not the first time the Philistines have
scattered Israel," cried Judy, her wit irresistibly
provoked by the opportunity.

A bright smile lit up Lord Le Pole's
languid visage' banishing for the moment
what seemed its chronically languid expression.
His eyes, dark and deep-set, glowed
as they sought hers with such a commanding
force she could not help but meet their
gaze, but only for a second, and then her
long lashes swept down on the tell-tale
blushes.

The gods are prodigal," he said ; " beauty
and wit in one."

Ting," repeated the Cricket imperiously.

Ormsby, sir, come away ; you know Uncle
Leppo never sings before people," cried his
mother.

Then I suppose I needn't ask," said Judy
shyly and evidently speaking to assist her
composure.

For answer he took the child on his knee
and struck some preluding chords.

Lady Margaret sat down on the stone steps
of the door.

Do you sing ? " he said to Judy, '' but of
course you do."

Only ballads," she replied, " but I love old-fashioned
songs  classic, I suppose, is the
correct term ; will you sing one ? "

"I never sing but in the mood, and I own
to a dislike of silly words," and then while she
stood before him, her shyness for the moment
ozone, he saner in a rich tenor :

The fountains mingle with the river

And the rivers with the ocean,
 The winds of heaven mix for ever
AVith a sweet emotion.
Nothing in the world is single,

All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle  
Why not I with thine ? "

When he had reached the last line Judy
had moved aside, he could no longer see her
face. He rose and set the child down.

Turn about is fair play," he said, " just
one verse too ; I love ballads  old-fashioned
ballads."

She had no will to resist. Her heart was
still vibrating with the searching melody, she
felt spell-bound. She could sing anything she

152

had once heard without the aid of the printed
notes, so the young lady's excuse that she had
not her music never occurred to her.

I see papa and Mr. Egbert," cried Lady
Margaret.

But obedient to the expectant eyes, in which
she fancied the ardent question of Shelley's
song craved answer, Judy sat down.

A ballad is too long," she said, " and I
haven't time to choose, so I'll sing whatever
comes first ; " and that was " Allan-a-dale."

Only the first and third verses she sang 
sang like a young thrush, clear and full, with
a trill that in the feathered songster's melody
tells that its mate is nicrh.

Allan-a-dale has no faggot for burning,
Allan-a-dale has no furrow for turning,
Allan-a-dale has no fleece for the spinning,
Yet Allan-a-dale has red gold for the winning.
Come read me my riddle, come hearken my tale,
And tell me the craft of bold Allan-a-dale.

Allan-a-dale to his wooing has come,
His mother she asked of his household and home :

Though the castle of Richmond stands fair on the hill,
My hall,' quoth bold Allan, ' shows gallant still ;
'Tis the blue vault of heaven with its crescent so pale
And with all its bright spangles,' said Allan-a-dale."

The sound of her voice gave her confidence
and the stirring air fired her spirit. As she
finished she Tufted her eyes, now full of fun,
and met her companion's admiring gaze with,
he thought, a mischievous sparkle. She did
not wait for compliments, but snatching up
her gloves joined Lady Margaret, who had
gone on a few yards in advance to meet her
father and the squire. Lord Le Pole followed
leisurely. He was once more the listless, apathetic
exquisite, whose sole desire seemed to
be to convince the world that man delighted
him not nor woman either.

There was no time for the proposed stroll
in the grounds ; that was reserved. Lady
Margaret hoped, for another not far distant
day. The horses were already at the door,
and after an interchange of kisses with the
Cricket and frank adieux to the rest of the
party, Gloriana received her light burden and
pranced with impatience for the road.

Perfect, absolutely perfect," drawled Lord
Le Pole, as he took off his hat.

Isn't she ? " cried Judy with a backward
glance of delight.

A combination of perfection," he replied ;
a compliment which returned Judy's head to
its frontal condition with a toss of disdain and
brought down on Gloriana's shoulder an airy
tap from the feathery wand she was pleased to
call a whip.

A start, a quiver, and the fiery animal
bounded from the ground with an impetuosity
that would have tried a veteran in the saddle ;
but Judy kept her seat without apparently
the slightest effort.

Softly, my beauty softly," she cried coaxingly.
Then relaxing the repressive rein she
gave the mare her head and was off, the
squire doing his noble best to pick her up.

I wonder Egbert trusts her on such explosive
material," said Lord Albany.

Trust her ; " exclaimed his son, " I never
saw anything finer, the mare gave to her hand
like a supple bough. Her seat is magnificent."

Then turning? to a oroom who had brought
round the cob and who was standing agape
with delight and admiration at the young
lady's horsemanship, he asked would the mare
be for sale when exhibited.

No, my lord," the man answered. " Mr.
Peters, the squire's stud groom, ses as the
mare is the miss's, she's only to be showed ; "
and then he added confidentially, " they do say
as she rides better wanting the saddle."

With a slow step and abstracted mien the
young lord turned silently away and strolled
towards the wood at the north end of the
mansion.

It took the best part of an hour to reduce
Gloriana's response to the unintentional tap
on her shoulder to a sober pace. Then the
lengthening shadows pointed to the sunset
hour. The long, broad, dusty road had lost
its white glare, and the scent from the
gaily-ventured hedge-rows of hawthorn and
honeysuckle, and from the fields beyond, of
meadow-sweet and fragrant grasses, filled
the air with a dreamy perfume. In the
meadows the grass rose strong and thick
and richly green, or gleamed with refreshing
coolness amid the massed buttercups like
cloth of gold. In parts most exposed to the
sun the crop had been cut, and the young
aftermath showed a sickly yellow fainting

for a shower ; in others the brown tints and
the ripening seed, with here and there a tinge
of dull red, where the sorrel rose high, marked
the course of the scythe for the morrow. Up
from the hollow meads the rising slopes were
clothed with the young wheat, each stalk
tipped like a sceptre. It was nearing seven,
and but a few stragglers were seen on the
road. Here and there a weary horse cropped
the succulent herbage by a ditch, or a donkey
stood in the middle of the road patiently
flapping his ears and tail at vain issue with
the flies. The very cottages behind the
hedges had an air of idleness, and over the
snug farmsteads a spirit of peace and repose
seemed brooding. Great ein - trees overshadowed
the old thatched cattle-sheds and
rick-yards, and by one homely cluster of
venerable buildings a stream from a descending
slope broadened into a wide deep brook,
thickly fringed with green flags bearing
erratically great yellow leaves. Beside the
cattle-shed under the elms a dam crossed the
water, forcing it into a pond for the cattle
and harbourage for the ducks. Now and

then a dog would trot leisurely out of the
thatched gate at the sound of the horses'
feet, make silent scouting, and trot leisurely
back ; the passers-by, he saw, were not within
the range of his duty, which was to keep
tramps at bay.

At turn of a rising hill the show vicarage
of the county, as Judy irreverently called it,
came into view. A quaint, profusely-gabled
old house, literally covered with ivy except on
the frontage, which was one gorgeous sheet
of Gloire de Dijon, the pride of the vicar's
wife.

The circling wood divided the vicarage
from the Egbertss' parish church, a venerable
structure, whether of Anglo-saxon or early
Norman architecture archaeological could not
determine. Before the parsonage, on which
the sun smiled all day long when smile he
did, a time-old garden, centred by a velvet
lawn, sloped down to a little river, across
whose still breast beeches arched their topmost
branches, and whose banks were clothed
with a thick vesture of blue forget-me-nots.

Nearing the peaceful home of the living

and the dead, Judy said softly, the calm evening
influence on her spirit :

I do not know any spot where life and
death seem so beautifully blended'*

To the outward eye, Judy."

One would like to sleep there," and she
pointed to a mound under two yew-trees,
whose interlacing branches had been cut into
a shrouding arch.

No one is ever buried there now," said
the squire, halting for a second. " Fifty years
ago there was a murder in the village. It
couldn't be brought home to the suspected
person, a woman. She died in her bed and
was laid there. A year or so after a paper
was found in an old desk she had left to her
grandson, which he had sold. It contained
the confession of the murder, so her family
took away the headstone and broke it up,
and her grave has remained undisturbed by
stranger or kin ever since. But you see,
Judy, the sunset's glow lights up the dark
arch, and the daisies and coltswort are as
bright and fresh on the turf beneath as on
that mound beside the east window where

the saintly Mary Marlwood, the vicar's mother,
lies."

"He maketh His sun to shine on the evil
and on the good," whispered Judy.

They pursued their homeward way without
further speech, but each intent on the day's
dying splendours. To the young spirit they
spoke of life and hope, filling it with a glad
worship and yearning for some great thing
to do. To the worn and weary spirit they
seemed an earnest of that land so full of rest,
which eye hath not seen, nor whose deep
songs of joy ear hath not heard.

When the grey old walls of Egbert Hall
came close in sight a trembling star stood out
refulgent, and sunset glow bathed the upper
windows and tipped the still tender green of
the wood.

As they trotted up the drive the squire
said a little meekly, " How did you like your
visit, Judy ? "

 " I don't think I ever enjoyed a ride more,"
she answered, blushing ; and the squire was
satisfied.

A chief's among us takin' notes."

By the middle of the week on which Judy had
gone with Dulsie to Egbert Hall, Mrs. Aylmere
was pleasantly lodged in the same house
where Mrs. Beaumorris had apartments. She
had come from quiet respectable Casterham
fully prepared to make or mar a plot, and one
of the principal dramatis per since had vanished.
But Mrs. Aylmere was of an inquiring mind,
and she set herself to work to collect materials
in the event of fresh opportunities occurring
for her interposition. To do this it was
necessary to become mistress of the situation.
She was of rather a timid nature, though
persistent, a quality by no means inconsistent
with that temperament. She therefore preferred
reaching a desired end by a circuitous
route, taking care with a kind of feline
instinct to mark points of vantage for escape,

and to keep the way clear for retreat if occasion
called.

The evening of her arrival she spent at the
Lodfe, and there bv an inadvertent remark of
Sybella she gathered that the major's departure
had been sudden, if not mysterious.
Mabella's aspect was, however, so serene,
her answer to the widow's purposely inadvertent
question, " If he would return this
season," so indifferent in its negative, that a
less experienced inquisitor would have been
misled.

If," she said to herself, " if their acquaintanceship
had not been a little more
than ordinary Mabella would not have come
out so pat with that ' no ;' neither would
Sybella have watched her face when I asked
the question."

Then she thought that Sybella turned a
slightly inquisitorial eye on herself, and
anxious to ward off observation from her concealed
purpose she, like the lapwing when
her nest is threatened, trailed a wounded wing,
slowly circling away to lure the intruder from
her treasure.

I heard he was very fascinating," she
said, " and I feared for Judy. You see, she
is a little impressionable, and has made me
uneasy in another quarter."

The rase succeeded.

Mr. Eawson," exclaimed Sybella in a tone
of a foregone conclusion.

My dear Mary," this from Mabella, " it is
only calf-love. Calf-love is a species of vaccination;
it guards you from the vital disease,
or if you do take it, you take it mildly. I
never saw a gayer girl than Judy ; she's just
as heart whole as I am."

"I think that kind of vaccination very
risky," said Sybella, " and very far from
effectual. You are very liable, when you
are well up in years, to have an attack of
the real thing, and then it is all up with you,
for your elasticity is gone and you succumb
without a struggle."

"What a picture," cried jars. Aylmere,
perfectly understanding the covert allusions ;
but prevention is better than cure, you
know. Judy may not be fancy free, but I
aijree with Mabella she is heart whole, and

I want her to r imam so. Is Mr. Eawson still
here?"

Yes, but lie leaves next week," said
Mabella. " He called to-day to tell us of a
tempting offer he has had. Some uncle  a
London merchant, I believe  has written to
propose he should stand for Oxminster ; the
seat is vacant by death."

Why, he hasn't two hundred a year,"
exclaimed Mrs. Aylmere, " and no profession."


"And no creed," added Sybella. "But youth
is omniscient ; it surmounts the impossible
by the impossible. Mr. Eawson will charge
the windmill without even the traditionary
sword."

His uncle," said Mabella, " offers him an
allowance of five hundred a year, but he
makes one proviso, his politics must be ultra-liberal."


I know who his uncle is," observed Mrs.
Aylmere ; " he is a city knight. Sir Janitor
Tomlinson, a very pretentious man, immensely
rich and extremely mean ; a widower
with no family, an entirely self-made man.

Mr. Eawson is fortunate. Of course he
accepts."

No ' of course ' about it," said Mabella.
The young man is no time-server. He has
written to say that he should wish to take
advantage of his uncle's liberality, but that
he must stand on perfectly independent principles,
pledged to no party."

I suppose," observed Sybella carelessly,
"Mr. Eawson, like his uncle, has no pretension
to good blood."

His mother's name was Tomlinson, but
I believe his father comes of a good though
decayed family," returned Mrs. Aylmere.

Then take my advice and keep Judy out
of the way until you see how he gets on.
Don't lose sight of him though ; these are
degenerate days, and a city fortune is not
to be despised. In this case it may have a
high mission," but what that mission might
be Sybella did not say.

Ah, yes," sighed Mabella, letting in a
little light on her sister's train of thought,
nothing like building up an ancient house
for taking the alloy out of money made by

trade. But I can't say the name of Eawson
strikes me as having the true ring in it."

Mrs. Ayhnere did not pursue the subject.
Whatever the name of Eawson might sound
to the Miss Egbertss, to her it had now, and
for the first time, a true metallic ring.

"I hear," she said, "that the famous beauty
Mrs. Beaumorris has rooms next to mine. Is
she a pleasant person ? "

'sto gentlemen, very," said both sisters.

She is an income to Cook the photographer
in Winsome Street," said Mrs. Ayl-
mere.

A mutual benefit," remarked Sybella ; " he
pays her a royalty. If nature were not so
artfully assisted and so liberally adorned, she
would hardly pass so well. Her chief beauty
is her grace, and that, you know, is the secret
of her effective poses. I wonder what keeps
her here ; the London season is just in its
height."

I heard," said Mabella, " that she had no
house in town this year, that she would
not go into rooms, and that she could not
afford a hotel. Mr. Beaumorris hired a yacht

VOL. I. 1 6

instead. I heard her say something about
making up a party for a cruise."

A party, Mabella ! Men and a good chef,
you should say. She openly declares her preference
for the society of men. Miss Prance
says she never goes near a woman unless she
wants a blind or a foil. But she has a rival
here who is running her close, Mrs. Trelaw-
ney, a dashing Irish belle, witty and good-humoured
; Miss Eber, too, is much admired.
So the London beauty hasn't it all her own
way in out-of-the-way little Sandycot."

M miss Eber ! Why, you wouldn't name her
in the same breath with either Mrs. Beaumorris
or Mrs. Trelawney?" cried Mabella warmly.
"In the first place she is insignificant, then
she lias no style, and she is an adventuress."

She is lovely, I think," returned Sybella ;
and as for the rest, one can't be hypercritical
in Sandycot. She is a great friend of Mrs.
Horseman, and that suffices for her respectability,
I think."

Or her notoriety ; " Mabella spoke viciously
for her.

Judy took a great fancy to her. She is

quite young, and yet she has no look of inner
south ; I should say she had come through
some great trial."

People with histories are to be avoided."
Mabella looked acrimoniously exclusive.
"Mrs. Horseman may take what liberties she
chooses with London society, that can take
care of itself, but with small communities like
this, where every one knows every one and
intimacies are so easily formed, she ought to
be very careful who she is responsible for.
There is quite enough latitude already. Weare
constantly meeting people, pleasant
enough and very well in their way, but who
would be inadmissible into county society ;
there we make a point of knowing who's who.
I know what you are going to say, Sybella ;
that Miss Eber is a Jewess and beyond a
pedigree in our sense of the word ; but Jews
as yet have no independent social status ;
they force their way into society adventitiously
by wealth or genius. As a proof of
the truth of what I say, name me one family
who, like ourselves or even the Brownie 
and they can only go back a hundred years 

162

take their place anywhere in society as a
matter of course and apart from individual
qualifications. My dear, it takes three generations
to make a gentleman and the Jews'
Disabilities Act has not covered one yet."

Sybella named several eminent Jewish
names.

Cases in point, my dear ; adventitious
adventurers, every one."

Oh, Mabella, that is going too far ; you
can't call the Wrathsbairns adventurers, or
the Duke of Tancred. Why, these people areas
much above society as society is above a
retired greengrocer."

Sybella, an adventurer does not cease to
be an adventurer because he is successful,
any more than a usurper ceases to be a
usurper because he reigns. The Wrathsbairns
are a dynasty now, I grant you, but who
knows anything of the family apart from the
heads and the heiresses who have married
well? Then as for the Duke of Tancred,
though I reverence his very name, for he is
the bulwark of our old institutions, yet I am
sure, had he been in the purple he would not

have lead that over-appreciation of rank and
circumstance lie shows so palpably."

Mrs. Aylmere smiled to herself. " Over-appreciation
of rank," she thought to herself;
sitting in judgment on that as an evidence
of alienship. And these women look down
on every one as pariahs who cannot claim
descent from some old Norman robber or
Saxon boor," but in a mild tone of reconciliation,
intended for both sisters, she said
aloud, " I never knew a Jewish family."

You would not be likely," Mabella remarked
obtusely, though with no intention of
giving pain. " Jews, as I have been trying to
prove, have only place among the very upper
circles and the artist and city classes ; they are
never met with among the middle-class gentry,
small professionals and people of that kind."

A distinction," retorted Mrs. Aylmere
blandly, " that ought to commend itself to
the small professionals ; they escape both
successful adventurers and old clo' men "

You see," said Sybella in a bantering
tone, " respectability has its advantages, and
extremes are to be avoided."

As Mrs. Aylmere, atteiidsd by a page,
walked lions to lier lodgings in Shore Street
she felt grateful to the calm mooiiUght, it
soothed her ruffled susceptibilities. " It is
always the same," she said to herself ; " I am
never half-an-hour in their company but they
manage to remind me that I am not of their
order ; to keep me in my proper place, T
suppose. If it weren't for Judy"  at that
name the widow's irritation passed away, and
fair in the soft still air of nio[lit there rose
soon a stately castle, whereof a bright-haired,
bright-eyed, and, to the builder's sight, peerless
maiden reissued chatelaine. The smile that
accompanied the coin with which she feed
the page on reaching home compensated that
usually mercenary youth for the smallness of
its value.

I never thought the old 'un like Miss Judy
before," he said as he whistled himself across
the sands back to the Lodge.

o

The next morning Mrs. Aylmere entered
her name as a subscriber to the library over
which she had her habitation. The bookseller,
Mr. Tims, who was her landlord, she

found taciturn, but his wife a gossip of the
first water.

Mrs. Aylmere's voucher having been Miss
Egbert, she was treated with deference.

The major's attention to Miss Egbert had
been the talk of the place. Many a discussion
concerning his intentions and his probable
success had been held in that little shop and
eagerly caught in by Mrs. Tims' quick ears.
She was sharp, and she saw that her new
lodger was inclined to be " conversable," as
she phrased it, and as she herself was at all
times ready to be communicative a good deal
of small talk was interchanged between the
two. Both had a certain latent object in their
affability. Mrs. Aylmere wished to hear if
her cousin's flirtation had attracted public
notice, also in what estimation Major Tyler
was held. Mrs. Tims, on her part, was
curious to know how far the matter had
really progressed, and above all what had
caused the handsome major's sudden departure.
The fencing was admirable. Commonplaces
about Sandycot were exchanged, a few
of the principal visitors named by Mrs. Tims

discussed, and a photograph of Mrs. Beau-morris,
"By the sad sea-waves," bought by
Mrs. Ayhiiere.

"You ought to get Miss Ayhnere done,
ma'am," Mrs. Tims said. " Major Tyler  you
have heard of the handsome major, I suppose,
he was a great friend of the squire ? "

Mrs. Aylmere gave a significant nod.

"Major Tyler wanted her to be taken as a
mermaid, so Miss Dulsie told me, sitting on a
rock and combing her beautiful hair. She is
quite the belle of Sandycot, ma'am, if I'm not
too bold in saying it."

Mrs. Aylmere smiled as if gratified.

An only daughter is a great anxiety," she
said. " I think young girls ought to be kept
in the background. This public sale of
private gentlewomen's photographs jars on
my old-fashioned notions. Have you one of
Major Tyler ? "

Mrs. Tims searched her collection.

"I'm afraid," she said, "Miss Osbert iot
the last."

"Miss Egbert?" and Mrs. Aylmere shook
her head gravely.

Yes, ma'am. People do say  but Sandy-cot
is such a place for gossip  that the major
was very sweet on her. It doesn't seem
likely, does it, ma'am? No one seemed to
know much about him. Mrs. Beaumorris
knew him, for I heard her say she had danced
with him."

Is there any gambling at the club here ? "
Mrs. Aylmere asked with apparent inconsequence,
but a meaning glance,

Mrs. Tims was quick ; she nodded confidently.


A deal," she answered ; " well now, how
strange things do turn up. I always said he
wasn't a man to be trusted, and I know,"
another nod, " he was sometimes very flush of
cash ; yet from all I've heard he never once
cashed a cheque while he was here. But I'm
bound to say he was always very punctual
paying everybody, and he didn't look like a
sporting gent. It must have been cards, and
cards is the ruination of hundreds. Well,
I've known the old family at the Hall since I
wasn't the height of that counter, and I'd be
main sorry to see any harm come to it. But

he'll be a great miss at the Lodge, though as
for Miss Egbert ever thinking of him, it's just
clack."

Mrs. Tims looked confidently and inquiringly
at her customer, but with no satisfactory
result. Mrs. Aylmere had got more than the
worth of the photograph she had bought, but
the vendor not one fraction over its value,
beyond an ambiguous question, a portentous
shake of the head, and a significant nod, out
of which, however, she managed to make
some not insignificant capital. And now, her
end accomplished, Mrs. Tims' customer allowed
herself to become suddenly conscious that she
was compromising her dignity, if nothing else,
by encouraging idle talk. She noticed, too,
the gradually familiar tone into which her landlady
was lapsing, and drew up, she hoped
in time, taking care to keep, as she mentally
expressed it, her instrument well in hand for
future use if needed. So with a look of stiff
surprise and the slightest knit of the brows,
suggestive of distaste, but in a conciliatory
voice, she said :

'you are interested in the old family, I

know, or you would not have named such an
absurd report to me, and I am sure you will
take every opportunity to contradict it."

She then asked her way to the baths, and
left with a friendly good morning.

CHAPTER I.

You'll break my hearty thou bonnie bird
That sings upon the bough,
For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
And wist no' o' my fate."

The next day there was a dinner-party at
Seapinks, a few hours before which Judy sent
an excuse. Dulsie had caught a cold, and as
Sybella and the squire were going, she stayed
at home to keep her cousin company. Dulsie
had taken her elder sister's defection greatly
to heart, and Judy could not bear the thought
of her spending a long evening by herself,
nervous under the depression of what might
prove a rheumatic cold, and anxious as to
Mabella's future. She was perhaps not very
sorry for the pretext. She felt the necessity
of taking her feelings, under their present
VOL. m. 33

perturbation, strictly to task. Without one
atom of personal vanity, she was yet too
quick of apprehension not to perceive that
Lord Le Pole was, notwithstanding his insouciant
manner and light badinage when others
were present, thoroughly in earnest in his intentions
reo-ardin<ij her. She knew she would
ere lons have to face, what she too certainly
felt would be, the crisis of her life.

'' Did she love him ? "

Her heart gave but one answer.

But had she not loved Ned Eawson ? Unerringly
came the heart's reply, it incas not
love. Yet it might have been. Yes, she
was sure of that. Had fate not cast Le Pole
in her way perhaps, her mind might not have
suddenly been awakened to its latent powers,
nor she have discovered that her nature had
deeper needs than could be filled by the
merry companion of her quickly-vanishing
girlhood.

He had been at pains, too, she remembered,
to impress upon her the fact, according to
his taking, of the intellectual inferiority of
women. A man, to him, was the world to

himself; into his deeper monitions, his ambitions,
his struggles, his work among men, a
woman might never enter. A wife, however
loved, would be to him, when the first gloss
of possession had worn off, but as his luxurious
country residence is to the city toiler.
There he finds rest from the hurrying to and fro
of the busy mart, luxurious ease for his tired
energies, and beauty for his eyes, wearied of
the dead monotony of brick and stone.

It was necessary, it was natural for a man,
however occupied, however great, to have
lighter moods and to give expression to his
lighter nature. He could not have that utter
relaxation he needed and loved with the stern
mates of his working hours ; it would not be
seemly. Neither could he have that appreciation
his soul craved. !Men were never the
heroes to each other they were to women.

But she should have all within her range

that she could desire or his means bestow ;

all of dress, luxury, amusement. He would

honour hier, be true to her, keep even the

winds of heaven from blowing too roucrhlv on

her, give up to her the all of self outside, not

332

the greater self that was his soul  yet even
that in part should be hers, for she should be
his religion.

All this, Judy knew, Ned would give, all
this he would be to her, and but a few short
weeks ago she did not seem to have wished
for more, to have known that her heart
craved for more. She had dreamt she loved
him. Alas ! from dreams such as these how
many wake too late ! But not little Judy.
The pleasant spell was broken, and she knew
that her lover-friend had

'' Asked for the costliest thing

Ever made by the Hand above,
A woman's heart, a woman's life,
And a woman's wonderful love."

She knew that he had asked

'' For that precious thing

As a child might ask for a toy ;
Demanding what others had died to win,
With the reckless dash of a boy."

But in this hour of silent questioning she
summoned him to " the bar of her woman's
soul," and her heart gave the verdict. There
was no voice to plead for him there.

Then lie thought of that other, so lately
found, yet now so one with her life, it
seemed to her that he must always have been
a part of that life. His voice sounded in her
ear as no other voice had ever sounded, his
eyes haunted her with an all-pervading presence.
She thought of his words. They were
not many, they had not known each other
many days, yet how earnest they were  that
was when they were quite alone. With light
touches what garnered knowledge they told
of, and, too, what depths of human sympathy;
yet it was nothing outward that had made her
captive. Measuring man with man in outward
seeming, Xed had the advantage : and
even in natural graces  truth, honour and
kindliness  he could lose nothing by comparison
: but it was 

The secret svmpatbv,
The silver link, the silent tie,
Which heart to heart and mind to mind
In body and in soul can bind"'

She had placed him, too, at the bar of her
woman's soul, and her heart had driven the
verdict, for love had pleaded for him there.

Came there then the sweet words he had sung
the first day, counting such time by hours, of
their meeting :

Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle,
Why not I with thine ? "

And she knew theirs had mingled. Then
her e3es, soft and yearning, sought the sea
slumbering restlessly in the placid moonlight,
and she wondered with dreamy consciousness
what it was that so instantly had quickened
the unsuspected dormant principle of love
within her breast ; but all of answer the ever-sounding
and mysterious sea gave was "love's
best interpreter, a sigh."

Her gaze travelled back to earth. She felt
the influence of love everywhere, in the living
heavens, in the teeming earth, in the silence
and the shadow. Yet there was no answer to
her quest. Then insensibly to her memory
came the words of the passion-poet Byron :

Why did she love him ? Curious fool, be still ;
f s human love the growth of human will ? "

And Judy, closing her eyes, prayed that hers
might be the growth of the will divine.

She was all alone in the drawing-room.
Diilsie had gone to bed. She had, she said,
a rheumatic chill, and if she took it in time it
might be checked. She wished to be present
at Judy's first ball, so she would take care of
herself. Judy was glad to be alone. The
quick minutes flew, no loneliness had made
time laggard. Quick-coming fancies had
peopled the pleasant chamber. She was
sitting in Dulsie's pillowy chair in the deep
window, the doors of which were open wide.
On the table in the centre of the room was
the large lamp, its. light, at Judy's instance,
lowered. No other light was lit.

Her head leant back on the soft cushion.
Her hands were idly clasped before her. On
her bosom was a bunch of forget-me-nots.
Suddenly a shadow fell on the gravel path
beneath ; she had not heard the step on the
lawn. She started up, and with a face all
aglow with love and pride, with the assured
air of a joyous welcome, Ned Eawson appeared
before her.

Just for a second a guilty feeling of
treachery touched her sensitive consciousness,
but a glance at Xed's jubilant visage restored
her self-possession.

May I come in ? " he asked, laughing with
eyes and lips.

She held out her hand in iireetinii. He
tripped as he stepped on to the matting, and
she laughed. He held her hand in both of
his, and looking down on her with his eyes
full of happiness, said :

I got your message from your mother,
Judy, but you might have written it yourself."

What message ? " was on her tongue ;
she had sent none. But she checked herself
in time ; she did not care to convict her
mother of an untruth.

We are all very glad for your sake," she
said with more warmth than she was aware
of. Her heart smote her, for she did like him
very much  she did not wish to pain him.

Yes," he said, ' it was a great triumph,
and so unexpected, for I thought he would
have run me hard."

Have you taken your seat ? " she asked.

Oh, yes."

I needn't ask on which side," she said ;
I had no idea you were such an ultra-radical,"
and her sweet face, so child-like and
piquant, took a shade of grave concern, her
usual airy pose just a whit of dignity.

Xed started a moment, and then, as if overcome
by an absurdity, burst into a merry laugh.

Ultra-radical ! " he repeated ; " shy,
Judy, who taught you that ? "

The indignant blood mounted to her very
brow, bui that was all her protest. Her eyes
fell on the forget-me-nots in her breast, and
she forgave him. She even answered :

o

I wished to understand things, and so I
read the papers, and Elsie Eber explained
what was difficult. But I did not find the
subject so very difficult, Mr. Eawson, and
when I said you were 'ultra-radical' I
meant you had gone further than your constituency
required."

With an air of badinasfc, but withal tenderness,
Xed floundered on.

'Mr. Eawson !' Judy, you are in a pet. I
humbly beg your pardon ; I did not see your

stockings matched your flowers," and he looked
at the little blue forget-me-nots significantly.

She would not quarrel with him.

"The worse for you," she said lightly ; " I am
true blue. But I do think you might have
drawn the line at the Licensing Bill, Ned." She
looked up at him with frank eyes full of intelligence.
" Ned, you have a strand career
before 3'ou ; won't you make principle your
standard ? You don't approve of that Bill 
I have heard you say so to Mr. Horseman 
you are not opposed to the duke's foreign
policy, and yet you have pledged yourself
against your convictions. I thought better
things of you, Ned."

Could this be the little Judy of but a few
weeks since ? Judy with sharp repartee and
girlish raillery, the best lawn-tennis bat in
the county, the prettiest, longest, dearest,
sweetest little girl that ever fell to a fellow's lot?
for Judy was his lot, that he knew. Why,
it was only a few months since she asked him
what was the use of politics, when there were
so many laws ; and did lawyers make the politicians,
or the politicians the lawyers, and here

lie was arraigning him on " political convictions
" and questioning his "principles." It
was that prig Le Pole, he was sure. Then
he remembered, as in an inspired flash,
that the fellow had worn a sprig of forget-me-nots
the first day of nomination  it
was on his breast  and with a terrible
pang his jealousy took fire. He looked at
her. She was a little pale, and her sweet
eyes were grave ; yet he had never seen
her so lovely, so fresh, so pure. A great
longing swelled in his heart to clasp her in
his strong arms and lay her golden head
on his breast. A protecting, absorbing love
went out from him Only a second-thought
is electric. He stood almost in dumb amazement,
then he said very gently :

' Little Judy, what can women know of
politics ? It is a great and abstruse study, only
fit for a man's strong intellect. Women who
enter upon man's province unsex themselves.
They are queens of their own realms, and
these are  society for the bolder spirits, home
for gentler ones like you."

Alas lor Ned ! One peep into the little

heart swelling indignantly at his tirade, and
he would have turned from the triumph he
had so lately won as from a mocking crown
of tinsel splendour.

She was not pale now ; her eyes glowed
with fire, but they fell on the flowers in her
breast, and she smiled. Then she looked up
at him proudly, but oh, so gently ; he could
have fallen at her feet and worshipped her
where she stood.

I think," she said slowly and clearly, " I
think a woman who cannot enter with a full
apprehending mind into all lier husband does
and knows is not fit to be queen of his home.
A woman's intellect is as keen as a man's ; it
is only a little less in degree, and necessarily
so ; except out of the natural order of things
she is not called on to stand the wear and
tear of the great vocations of man  politics
and commerce and the learned professions 
but she is called on to understand all these
things that she may be his helpmeet, and so
be a part of his innermost life, not merely the
toy of his idle hours. A man who shuts a
woman out of his larger life is no helpmeet

for her. I doubt if he has a larger
life."

A great fear made Xed's heart standstill.


Judy, little Judy," he cried, " some one
has come between us."

He took her hand. She drew it quickly
away ; her face was averted. Again the
colour had left her cheeks, but she was very
erect and very still.

"Some one," he cried with a voice that
seemed to supplicate and demand in one,
some one has been trying to spoil my innocent
dove, my little womanly darling. Nay,
you must hear me. Girl as you are, Judy,
you are a woman, too, and you know  you
have always known 1 love you. You have
let me think you love me, too. I did think so,
and I valued my triumph at Oxminster most
for your sake ; it gave me a career and the
hope of winning you. Do 3'ou forget how
often you urged me to work P Was it only for
my own sake ? "

She shook her head as if in pain, and her
eyes fell on the ground.

I would not write, Judy, and fed on your
message  the message you sent me tlirouo-h
your mother ; for I said I would tell you my
story face to face, and get your answer from
your own sweet lips. I told my uncle about
it. He did not say much at first, or promise
anything, but when he sent me on the invitation
to the ball he wrote me this letter, and I
brought it here to lay it at your feet. It tells
me I am to be his heir, and he bids me bring
my pretty bride home to Janitor Hall. I got
it, Judy, the night I took my seat in the House,
and there was not in that great assembly a
prouder, a happier man. You will come, won't

you, Judy ? You will be my Oh, girl, do

not break my heart. What has turned you to
ice ? You are no coquette. You did not seek to
win my heart, only to throw it aside as you
would a coveted trinket when you were tired
of it. You did love me. Listen to me, Judy.
You shall learn all about politics if you will. I
will be your teacher, darling. Judy, speak tome.
Only lift your eyes ; do not be so still.
Oh, who has come between us ? " He spread
his hands before her in an attitude of appeal,

bending his face, as if by the very force of his
pain to draw hers upwards.

She did lift her eyes. The tears were
streaming from them She placed her palms
in his, and said, speaking as firmly as she could,
Ned, beloved friend, it was all a great
mistake. I do not love you  I never did love
you, and indeed  indeed, I did not know you
loved me as you do."

'' What did you mean then," he demanded
almost fiercely, holding her hands so tightly
the old ring; she wore cut into her finger, but
she did not wince, " what did you mean by
that message, by sending me your ' dear love ' 
these were your words  ' that you were proud
of me, and that the time would be long till

you saw me aoam

?"

''Ned," she whispered, " I did not send }'ou
any message poor mamma imagined I did, I
suppose. I did not even know she had written
to you."

A blank dismay spread over his agitated
face ; he let her hands go and staggered back.

But you knew I loved you," he cried in
mingled pain and anger. " Oh, girl, girl, you

have done an evil thing, you have blighted my
life."

He turned from her, and with a proud
gesture covered his anguished eyes with one
hand.

Poor Judy, it was a terrible ordeal. Her
self-accusation was bitter. She thought her
heart would burst ; she had been playing with
fire, and she had not known it.

"Oh, Ned," she said, vainly checking her
sobs, " I did not know what love was  was
then. If I married you, and did not give you
my whole heart, did not believe in you with
an unquestioning belief, did not feel in every
vein that we were one in one, that you were
my king, my all, then I should blight your life.
I cannot do this, Ned. You have a world in
which there is no place for a wife. I have
awakened, Ned, to my need of a fuller love
than your nature can ever give. All I want,
you have not to give ; what I have to give, you
do not want. Ned, dear Ned, we should but
blight each other's lives. Forgive me."

The tears came in streams, falling on the
pale forget-me-nots.

And be my friend still ; a friend is very
near one's heart, Xed, and I do love you very
dearly, but not with the love that alone makes
marriage holy. I did not think to wound you
so."

She took the hand that hung powerless by
his side. He gave a little shiver at her touch.
She raised it to her lips and kissed it, then she
turned silently away and made as if to leave
the room. But with an uncontrollable impulse
and a great sob of anguish he caught her to his
breast, pressed his lips fiercely on hers, whispering,
" Now I shall always know they were mine
first," and unloosed her, gently steadying her
against the open door at the window, then
plucked the flowers from her breast, and
dashed across the lawn out into the night. So
sudden, so blind his rush, he did not see a
figure standing in the very centre of the green,
under the cover of a bush ; neither did he look
back, or he would have seen it issue from the
gate with a quick defiant step and hasten outwards
to the shore. It was Lord Le Pole.

VOL. m. 34

With centric and eccentric scribbled o'er."

It was nearly twelve o'clock before Ned
returned to his hotel. As he came slowly
along the pavement an intimate acquaintance
could have noted a change in the entire man.
The youth seemed dashed from his face. There
were hard lines round his handsome mouth, a
knit in his smooth brow, and a cold, far-seeking
look in his eyes. He stooped, too, and his
hands were restless.

At the door of the hotel was a rather ancient
travelling-carriage, to which were attached
two rough and sturdy plough-horses. A
servant in loose-fitting country-made livery
and old-fashioned hat with tarnished gold
band was helping a porter in with an old
battered imperial. A venerable-looking, tall
and commanding woman stood in the hall ;
her attire was in keeping with the equipage ;

she lead just vacated a long cloak of brown
satin, with velvet cape, fastened in front by-great
gold clasps, and a bonnet with an elevated
crown and overshadowing leaf, surmounted by
a bird of paradise feather, thick low shoes with
broad ties, and tan-leather gloves. A long
veil of Chantilly lace hung wisely at the side
of her bonnet.

She was to all appearance an invader. The
waiters whispered in the background, and
maids peeped through the side doors affrighted.
Mr. Barnes, the landlord, was standing seemingly
bewildered before her.

As Ned entered he was followed by the
admiral and Mrs. Trelawney. They had been
dining at Leaping?, and had walked home The
tableau was sufro-estive of a breeze

Madam," repeated Mr. Barnes, ' I have
only one vacant room, and that will be
occupied at an early hour tomorrow. I
understood from Mrs. Trelawney," bowing to
that lady, " that you were to be accommodated
at Egbert Lodge."

Miss Le Pole ? " said Catty with a merry

twinkle in her eye, in anticipation of fun, as

342

she came gracefully forward and introduced
herself.

She was received with a court courtesy that
would have done honour to her Devonshire
Grace in the days of the Regency.

The temptation was irresistible ; Catty performed
its fellow with the gravest of faces and
stateliest of miens.

Mr. Egbert told me," she said, " that he
expected you at the Lodge tomorrow. He
will be greatly distressed when he hears you
are here."

Madam," replied Miss Le Pole, " I never
had the slightest intention of being any one's
guest but my own. I suppose, Mr. Barnes,
there is no objection to my using the room
you say is vacant for to-night. I intend to
drive straight home from the ball."

It is so small, madam," said the landlord
in real distress, "it could not possibly hold
your luggage."

He looked at the huge imperial and then
at the multifarious articles heaped on its top,
which were taken from the carriage.

Jonas," cried Catty, wheeling round, but

only in time to see that individual sneaking
off as quickly as his little legs could carry him.

Ned had watched the scene without a sign
that the humour of it touched him. There
was a present hardness on his face that bid
defiance to mirth. As I\Ir. Barnes ceased
speaking, he came forward and with a low
bow placed his room at Miss Le Pole's service.
It was a large airy one," he said, " any nook
did for a bachelor."

Miss Le Pole executed another reverence,
not the less stately for the gracious smile that
accompanied it.

May I ask your name, sir? " she said.

Eawson," he replied, adding as he turned
away ; " I will see my things are cleared out,
that you may get in at once."

Stop, Mr. Eawson," she cried ; "you are
the new member for Oxminster, I presume . "

Xed bowed.

I beg to thank you for your politeness.
I shall not forget it, and if you will honour
me with your company at the Manor House
in September I shall be pleased to turn you
loose among the partridges. Just drop me a

line to say you are coming, and I'll send to
Nettletliorp to meet you."

Ned thanked her indifferently and hastened
away.

Catty, with empressement and sly deference,
now asked if she could be of any use to Miss
Le Pole ; but the old lady, whom nothing ever
escaped, had understood the handsome Irishwoman's
derision. She knew that Catty was
turning her into ridicule, so she replied grimly,
and with old-fashioned pronunciation :

I'm much obliged to you, ma'am, but I
never found ornamental things of much use.
I'm not accustomed to gim-crackery. Pray
don't let my distresses keep you from your
grandfather."

She knew perfectly well the relation the ill-matched
pair bore to each other ; the ring of
the '' Jonas " uttered by Catty had made that
clear.

Catty laughed good-humouredly, heedless
of some ill-repressed tittering. She had a
flawless temper.

Oh, he's my husband," she cried ; " I picked
him up when I was bric-a-brac hunting ;

it's not every days one comes across an antediluvian
admiral. I dote on oddities, ta-ta ; "
and she kissed the tips of her fingers to Miss
Le Pole as she tripped oflT. But suddenly,
throwing her head back, she called out, "It's
not a fancy ball, remember."

Catty's skirt was long. With a saucy fling
she had thrown it full length on the round.
It caught in a basket standing beside the
imperial and upset it ; the contents were eggs,
and eggs are brittle. Full of penitence she
hastened back to the rescue, but to escape
the mess which spread as the eggs rolled over
and over and broke, she jumped upon a large
hamper at a little distance.

I hold you responsible," cried Miss Le
Pole to the distressed landlord. " There were
six dozen in the basket, and the market price
is ten to the shillings."

"Oh, I'll pay," called out Catty, adding ina
stage whisper, " never could resist the
antique."

Madam," said Miss Le Pole in a deep
voice, " don't measure other people's corn by
your bushel."

24 LOVE AND Liking.

At that instant, as if in recognition of a
familiar voice, a loud cackle came from the
hamper on which Catty had taken refuge,
and a goose's head was thrust through the
opening of the lid. She sprang airily to
the ground, gathered her train on her
arm, and hurried away, crying, as a parting-shot
:

Oh, two to one ; I'm off."

Bad tempers and dominant wills  master-minds,
with flattering unction, they are called
generally have the best of it in this world.
For after all peace-lovers are in the majority.
Miss Le Pole was a master-mind, and so far
she had had the best of it with all those with
whom she had come in contact.

She had brought with her, according to her
usual habit of combining business with pleasure,
a quantity of miscellaneous farm and
garden produce, and for fear of any further
mishap she determined, on the spot, to make
Mr. Barnes buy it as it stood. In vain he
protested that the hotel gardens kept the house
provided with vegetables and fruit, that he
bought his geese, when in season, ready for the

fire, and that for the matter of poultry the
yards were full to repletion.

Miss Le Pole let him protest, she meanwhile
making a calculation in a memorandum book,
which finished, she ruthlessly interrupted him.

Total value," she said, " sixty-three shillings
; allowed for broken efrs ; you can settle
with me in the morning. You'll find them all
riofht and a bargain, no wear and tear of
market, no carriage to pay, not a stale cabbage
leaf or burst gooseberry. I see to everything
myself."

It was getting late, the town clock chimed
half-past twelve. The carriage had rumbled
off to its lodgement, the maids, one bv one,
had disappeared, only one waiter and the
beleaguered landlord were left ; the latter was
simply helpless. Lord and Lady Albany were
his honoured guests ; this, their relative, was
not a person to offend. Then he took comfort
in the recollection of the good things he had
heard said of her vendible  they were always
of prime quality and never overpriced. Besides,
every porter had gone, something must be
done, the live stock could not stay in the hall

all night ; goodness knew how many cocks
there were, they'd be sure to crow, indeed it
was getting on to morning, lied better be
quick ; if he didn't close at once she, maybe,
wouldn't let the hampers be moved outside, and
if any of them were smothered she'd hold him
responsible. As it was, the eggs would be a
dead loss ; he was afraid they wouldn't do for
omelettes, so all things considered, he gave his
head one last vigorous shake, and closed.

Hang it," he said to himself, " I'll make a
dash at it. I'll pay on the nail and then it's
off my mind."

With that he counted out three sovereigns
and three shillings, which Miss Le Pole, who
had been returning her memorandum-book
to some mysterious receptacle within the
precincts of her outer garments, and gathering
up some small paper parcels, received
with a business nod, saying :

No need of a receipt for ready-money
transactions," and under the convoy of her
purchaser she went off to bed.

There are two classes of persons to whom
people are chary of owning kinship, poor

relations and relations who are eccentric.
On the whole, eccentricity is easier condoned
than poverty. It happens, too, that when the
eccentricity is associated with any rare gift ora
dash of the divine particular aurce or, better
still, accompanies money, it is awarded a consideration
seldom accorded to merit barren
of these adventitious accessories. To be a
character " is to be, within very wide limits,
irresponsible to society above or outside its
uses and habits.

From this standpoint the noble family of
Albany regarded their very unique relative,
Miss Sarah Le Pole  Sally she was called in
the primitive days of her youth. Ship, had
money and landed property, she was a person
of consideration  though it could hardly be
conceded that she was a considerate person 
she was an individual, in fact, at whose
approach people tucked their feet under
their chairs, metaphorically speaking, or met
her keen eyes with a fatuously deprecatory
look; they were never sure what she might
do or say  the possibilities of eccentricity are
undefined.

Since the appearance of little Judy Aylmere
on the scene, with the certainty, should she
survive the present family, of the Egbert
property, that portion of the old estate
owned by Miss Le Pole had acquired an
importance beyond its actual worth, which
was considerable. Drawn once more within
its ancient boundary it would make, with the
larger portion still retained by its original
owners, an estate of very considerable pretensions,
and, incorporated with the at present
heavily-burdened lands of Marlby Grange, a
property second to none in the county of

shire, the vast acveme of which boasted

of fewer owners in proportion than any
other county in England. It was a stake
worth social martyrdom to win. But, like all
fanciful people. Miss Le Pole was a very uncanny
person to circumvent. She was not
amenable to delicate attentions ; she was
inaccessible to affectionate solicitude ; nay, so
capricious was she by nature, it was impossible
to turn her weaknesses to account, and she did
not need, so was not open to, sympathy in her
pursuits. Her immediate relations said she

was void of family affection ; of her more
distant relations she knew nothing. Au reste
she was not ill-natured, she was not inhospitable,
but if her idiosyncrasies were pronounced
her virtues were negative. She seldom went
out of her way to do any one a good turn,
though she was capable of doing substantial
kindnesses on the impulse of the moment,
and she acknowledged no claim on her heart
or substance of living being. In a loose sort
of way she responded to the feeble efforts of
her nephew, Lord Albany, to keep up the
fiction of family sociability. She went now
and again, generally when she had business
in the neighbourhood, to call on " my niece
Albany," and at one time had honoured Le
Pole with no small degree of notice. Perhaps
if he had shown an agricultural bent, she
might have allowed her incipient liking to
grow, but when she saw that under him, asunder
his father, such matters would be
relegated to a steward, she dropped him out
of that loose receptacle she called her
affections, and on his declining to attend
an agricultural show at which she had a litter

of pigs, lie cancelled a considerable bequest
she had made in his favour.

But Miss Le Pole was a woman of many
wills, as her vainly remonstrant business agent
Avould some day testify. At the date of this
story, had she been gathered to her fathers,
she would have departed intestate, in which
case her nephew Albany would have inherited
as heir-at-law.

But, as is inherently the case in natures of
cold affections. Miss Le Pole was singularly
alive to sentiment. In her earlier years she
dignified it by the name of love. The scent
of the roses still hung round the name of
Egbert, and, unknown to herself, this was the
spring that had roused her to emerge from her
retreat.

In accordance with her fixed habit of seeing
to everything with her own eyes, aiding in
everything where practicable with her own
hands, Miss Le Pole had superintended the
refurbishing of a very magnificent court dress
and the adapting of it to a ball costume in the
fashion of the day. A country dressmaker
who went out by the day, and who was responsible

for Miss Le Pole's usual attire,
remodelled the rich velvet and lace with a
very satisfactory result ; the lace was exquisite
Venetian point, and in itself would have
condoned both poverty of stuff and rusticity
of make, but Miss Le Pole was a woman of
parts, and understood what was required of
her. The body fitted to admiration, was upto
date in cut, and the train of the orthodox
length, rich with a Venetian point, which
also draped the skirt, and a magnificent
shawl of priceless value enveloped her figure.
Diamonds of rare lustre studded the stomacher
and encircled her neck and head, which last
was dominated by a court plume springing
from a refulgent agrafe.

As Miss Le Pole entered the ball-room Lord
Albany experienced a lively sense of gratitude
to his venerable relative ; she had done justice
to her station and to him. Neither youth
nor beauty elicited deeper sentiments of admiration,
or rank, of which there was an
august sprinkling, of awe than the ancient
and eccentric aunt of the Earl of Albany.
The metamorphosis was startling. There

were those in that exclusive assembly who had
last seen the strong-minded spinster in a dun
coat and mushroom hat driving a tax-cart to
market. Others who had chaffered with her
over a doubted heifer at the fair at Nettlethorp,
and one, at any rate, who had been an eyewitness
of her adroitness in mocking styes.
A pair of gold eye-glasses, sparkling with
diamond dust, was suspended from her neck
by a slight Trichinopoly chain. The effect of
these when she levelled them at an object was
bewildering. Catty afterwards affirmed that
Mr. Green, under their operation, staggered
back, landing in Dulsie's arms, and that on
recovering his perpendicular he had made
hastily for the door, declaring that he had sunstroke.
Then she carried her height, five feet
ten, as Miss Prance said, " like a duchess,"
and moved, Miss Turner, the spiral young
lady, observed to Mr. Flaggg, like a
barbaric empress of Woman traditions," to
which informing illustration that gentleman
adapted a name, and that was Zenobia.

"Ah, yes, Zenobia," sighed Miss Turner;
'' how types recur, classic types especially.

A great psychological mystery, particularly
noses."

Mr. Flags cave an answering]: siiih and
said:

Yes, Woman noses."

Oh-what damned minutes tells be o'er,
AVho dotes, yet doubts ; suspects, yet fondly loves."

Judy, pale as the palest blush-rose, sat out
the first dance, for the partner for whom she
had reserved her hand had left by an early
train that mornings for London. A sudden
summons, it was understood. There were
many who would gladly have taken the place
of the absentee, but Judy had a ready excuse
for all. She sat very still under a shading
myrtle at the very top of the room. Lord Le
Pole opened the ball with Mrs. Beaumorris.
He also, like his ancient relative, seemed
metamorphosed. The opening dance was a
quadrille, through which he glided with
dilatory step, as if motion were compulsory
and existence a something' in which he had
neither part nor interest. He posed as simply
a well-bred automaton, obedient to the
mechanism of society.

* Richard is himseK again," said Creamy
languidly as, the dance over, they walked
round the room. " It is positively refreshing
to see you refriorerated. You have found out,
as I did long: aofo, that emotion is a blunder."

' Nay, divine Creamy," he returned, meeting
her glance with one as warm, " you
confound the effect with the cause. It is a
woman dio is ' one of mature's agreeable
blunders.' "

And therefore the cause of blunders," she
whispered meaningly; "and a pr6>/;(96'"  she
looked round the room as if struck by a
sudden thought  "where is your rival? in
politics, I mean, of course." This with
another significant glance, which elicited only
an imperceptible curl of the lip. " He was to
have been here ; I know he arrived yesterday."


They had reached the seat occupied by
Judy, and after a formal greeting on Lord Le
Pole's part, wdiichjust for the moment brought
a scared look into the girl's eyes, Creamy continued
:

"Perhaps Miss Aylmere knows."

352

Lord Le Pole placed his partner in a vacant
chair and bowed.

Knows what ? " asked Judy.

"Where Neddy is," cried Catty, bringing
up a Colonel Bolton, who had asked to be
introduced to Judy. She had been close
behind Creamy, and had heard just enough
to make her jump to the conclusion that it
was Mr. Eawson whose whereabouts was in
question.

"I'm sure I don't know," said Judy with
spirit and not a little hauteur, resenting the
battery of eyes turned on her tell-tale face, but
her heart absolutely quivering with pain. " I
was engaged to him for the first dance, but he
lias not come to claim me, so I've been doing
wall-flower," and she tried to laugh. " He
cometh not," she added.

"I am aweary, aweary," lisped Creamy,
slowly fanning herself.

Judy's ees looked dangerous. Le Pole?
watching her covertly, stood apart. " Little
traitress," his heart was saying, throbbing
painfully the while.

lyell," exclaimed Catty in genuine surprise,

" you do astonish me ;" then lapsing into
a Milesianism by no means usual with her she
added, " Sure, he went off by the first train to
London this mornings. I wouldn't have been
a wall-flower for the Prime Minister himself,
let alone the 'junior member,' as Miss Prance
calls him."

She then introduced Judy, and floated away
on the arm of her partner for the next dance,
for which the orchestra was giving warning
notes.

For the next dance ? " asked the colonel.

Engaged' was the low answer, the colour
returning to her pale cheeks.

'' The next, then ? "

Engaged," was the answer again ; but
looking at her card she entered his name low
down in the list, and with evident chao-rhi the
gallant officer, who had a reputation as a
lady-killer, bowed himself ofl* in quest of a
substitute.

This is ours, I think," said Lord Le Pole,
coming forward just as Creamy had been
claimed by one of her "reserves," and holding
out Lis arm to Judv.

The music, a waltz, struck up ; there was
no time for a word, and the questioning timid
look she hazarded was to eyes gazing coldly
at the bright scene.

They were perfect dancers, but they might
have been marionettes as far as the sentient
quality of the motion was present to either.
Yet with her little hand clasped tightly in his,
her golden head against his shoulder, touching
it ever and again, and his arm encircling
her slight figure, Le Pole for a passionate
moment felt he would be content thus to die ;
and Judy, his breath fanning her cheek, the
touch of his hand, cold and careless though it
was, thrilling her troubled breast, Judy with
a great yearning wished they could thus float
out together on the stilly night, away to some

Isle unknown,
Where they might live, love, die alone."

But the music ceased, and they awoke to cold
life again.

They walked round the room, greeting acquaintances,
exchanging light nothings with
the gay and careless, making an idle remark

to each Other now and again, but not once
looking' each other in the face. Ao-ain the
band summoned the dancers, this time to a
lively polka, and when the gay strains ceased
Le Pole placed his partner beside her mother,
taking: leave of her with an indifferent bow.

Wherever is Mr. Eawson, Judy ? " said Mrs.
Aylmere, " every one is talking ; perhaps Sir
Janitor has had a fit. Miss Prance says he
vas seen walking on the beach last night ; he
wasn't at the Lodge, was he ? " and she looked
with sudden suspicion in her child's face.

Mother, you torture me," said Judy, her
heart bursting.

Mrs. Admire was for the moment appalled
at the agitation Judy displayed and which
she vainly strove to suppress, but she was wise,
and forbore further questioning for the present.
Silently she slipped a vinaigrette into her
child's hand, and began fanning herself so that
the air evoked should cool the heated cheeks.
Then Judy was claimed for the next dance.
As on her partner's arm she passed away, she
heard her name linked with that of the absent
member for Oxminster. Standing aside, after

the first two or three rounds of the dance, she
saw Creamy posing against a pillar ; her back
was towards her, and by her side, looking into
her great languishing eyes as if there were no
other object to him in that glittering throng,
was Lord Le Pole. She stood fascinated,
wondering if whether or no her heart would
break, if it were quite true what Sybella was
always saying, " That men, men of the world,
make amusement out of simple girls ; that once
they had won a heart they ceased to value it,
and that it was their pride to show their
power." She wondered all this and in pain.
Then she heard her own name whispered by
Creamy  a whisper in a crowd travels further
than words spoken loudly  accompanied
by a little jeering laugh, which  yes, she
was sure of it  Le Pole echoed. Her eyes
lit up, her bosom swelled. Le Pole looked
round, their glances met, hers hot and
defiant, too proud for reproach, his coldly
contemptuous, and yet his heart misgave him,
for her lips trembled, and he saw it, and again
her soft young cheek blanched.

Just for a second the thought flashed

through her brain, " Could it be, could anyone
have whispered to him untruths about her,
and  and Xed ? " And simultaneously, too,
the thought rushed on Le Pole, " Could it be
possible, could he have misjudged her ? She
looked so strange, and the triumphant lover
was not there." Only for a fleeting second the
yearning sympathy going insensibly out from
the hearts drifting asunder mingled with restraining
force, only a second, then

You are too slight and fickle," he said,
to trouble the heart of Edward Gray."

There are no tricks in plain and simple
faith," she said, pride swelling in her indignant
heart. But pretty Judy Aylmere was
the belle of the ball. Neither the magnificent
Catty nor the great London beauty could hold
their own against the freshness and the bloom,
the exquisite sweetness of the young girl unblemished
by the world. And in all that gay
assemblage there did not seem a lighter heart.
Poised on pleasure's wing, " a gay little rover,"
she flitted from partner to partner, from dance
to dance, her eyes sparkling and her lips
alive with smiles and wit.

The squire followed her airy movements
with loving eyes ; Dulsie and Sybella, too,
with mingled pride and affection. Only Elsie
of all her friends watched the winsome girl
with a doubting heart, only she discovered,
with the unerring instinct of a fateful experience,
that the brightness and joyousness
were but sparks from a smothered lire, which
too surely she guessed was consuming her
heart.

Almost from the first, by that fateful experience,
she had guessed her girl-friend's
secret  only guessed, delicate natures like
Judv's are not given to crushing: confidences 
and had seen with gladness the pure bud of
love opening to perfect bloom. She had
recognized, too, that Le Pole was worthy of
her in a way that Ned could never be, yet by
no unworthiness in himself ; and that night she
had seen, with quick intuition, the blight
descend on the bloom.

She saw her, as if for the moment dazed,
sitting the dance so many begged in vain.
Then the pale bewilderment with which she
rose when, coldly indifferent, Le Pole claimed

her hand ; the listlessness of her perfect
dancing, the hard precision of his ; the wondering,
innocent look of suffering, too deep
for tear or sigh ; then the sudden rally, the
proud flush, the slight toss of the drooping
head, and the defiant gaiety which only to
Elsie had no ring of heart-joy.

Le Pole saw nothing of this. Jealousy and
anger had blinded his eyes. But unknown to
himself, by no Voluntary action of his outer
self, his face was ever towards the part of the
room in which she was, and over the music,
above the hum of voices, and through the
rustle and clang of the passing to and fro, her
voice was ever in his. ear.

Not so with Judy. With that sharp rally
she had shut him down in her heart, and lived
but for the triumph of her hour.

An archaic quadrille now and again gave
rest to the waltzers, and in Fete the squire
and Miss Le Pole revived the dignified motion
of their terpsichorean days. A blue-ribbon
steward, inspired by the daring Catty, to
whose blandishments he had incontinently
succumbed, proposed a minuet to the pair.

He did not see fit to urge his proposal,
but with a deprecatory bow sidled into
the covert of the crowd. The diamond-spangled
eyeglasses elevated on the loftT-
arch of the lady's nose gave him an
unusual sensation of relative smallness, and
the squire's dignified reproof  that they were
there for their own amusement, not for that
of others  a sense of shame and irritation,
which made him for the rest of the evening
chary of the fascinating Irishwoman.

Ari ! now, you didn't think I was in
earnest ? " she exclaimed as if horrified at his
temerity. '' Well, well, you Englishmen are
ninnies now. Just imagine any one asking
you to dance a hornpipe," and with eyes full
of raking mischief she stepped a pace or
two backwards and surveyed the somewhat
starched official, who was young and consequential.


Catty was impayahle. It was diverting to
watch the deft cozenaoe with which she
managed her irascible husband. His wife's
triumphs had long ceased to appeal to his
pride. He had discovered that he was keeping

a brilliant and expensive toy for the idle
gratification of those who, not envying him ashe
had intended they should, despised him,
and for the utter annihilation of his domestic
life. From the senile admiration which he
had called love, and the vanity which had
glamoured him into the belief that the young
and beautiful woman returned his love, he was
roughly awakened ; but Catty had a fascination
all her own  she could witch him out of his
most savage moods, could make him for the
moment believe, against the evidence of his
own senses, that the handsome, gallant-looking
men with whom she flirted, and who hung
over her in a way she did not encourage him
to do, were no more to her than she was to
them  the idle pastime of the hour  that her
real love was his and his only. Then she
would wind her arms round his neck, and bend
down her head, which towered over his, to his
shoulder, call him an old goosey-gander, and
kiss him into penitence for his crossness.

"But, Catty," he said one day peevishly,
after such a scene, " it seems to me you
always choose good-looking fellows for

your pastime, and always young ones,
too."

Of course, Jonas clear ; it would never do
to play with fne. Young men don't understand
the real tiling."

And for the time Jonas was satisfied, laying
the flattering unction to his heart that she had
found the real thing in him. But she was
attentive to him in her own way, and, as if in
some sort of compensation, saw to his creature
comforts assiduously. What she might drift
into she was too thoughtless to fear ; her
safety for the present lay in the light gaiety
of a heart that as yet had not learnt to love.

The squire, at Miss Le Pole's request, presented
Judy to her. The radiant girl, through
whose brain a train of recent memories dashed
the turret of the Hall and the squire's confidences
 glanced timidly in her face as she
gave her hand to the keen-eyed old woman,
who looked her, as she afterwards told Dulsie,
through and through. The scrutiny seemed
satisfactory to the venerable lady ; she did not
level her eye-glasses at Judy. She spoke some
kindly words to her, made the squire promise

to bring her to the Manor House, complimented
lier on her dancing and then, action
some gossip which had reached her ear
that evening, asked her what had prevented
Mr. Eawson from being present.

"I expected him," Judy replied quietly.
I kept the first dance for him."

Miss Le Pole nodded as if pleased.

He'll be an honour to his country, I am
sure," she said, " a man of purpose, not a
mooning idler," and she raised her glasses and
turned them in the direction of Le Pole, who
was devoting himself, as be had done all the
time he could spare from his duties as steward,
to the lovely Creamy.

Do you like the country ? " she asked of
Judy.

With a bright responsive look Judy said :

Oh, yes, I'm a hedge, not a town, sparrow.
I love the country ; but then," she added artlessly,
" Pve never been much in towns, and
I've never seen London."

Good,' said Miss Le Pole, " keep her
away from brick and mortar, Mr. Egbert.
Cities are soul-destroying and body-defiling;

they make women of the men and men of the
women. ' God made the country, but man
the town.' "

Then the squire introduced Judy to Lady
Albany, who received her with more than
civility  with marked favour  giving her an
invitation to spend two days at Marlby Grange.
But Judy, shrinking back, refused; she was
going to the Hall soon, she said, and then she
hoped to call at the Grange with her cousins,
but she could not leave home just then.

Lord Albany was not pleased with what he
had been on the alert to notice at the ball.
He saw that his son avoided the pretty heiress,
and he noted  he was not a deep-seeing
observer  that she seemed indifferent. They
did not understand each other as, from very
palpable signs he noted on previous occasions,
he had hoped they did ; things were going
against him.

Later in the night Elsie danced with Le
Pole. She was, as always, in black. This
night she wore silver flowers in her breast
and on her dress. They danced their waltz,
then strolled into the balcony and stood talking

for nearly half-an-hour. Ylien they returned
to the ball-room Elsie was mistress
of some electioneering facts, which, before she
retired to rest, she noted in a book of memoranda.
Only incidentally she had named
Judy, and then with some apparently careless
words, which, however, made the mark they
were intended to make.

Something has gone wrong with my little
friend Judy," she said.

Yhy," laughed Le Pole with a harsh
laugh, " she is the gayest of the gay. She
has come out in quite a new light, an airy
coquette."

"Men never see below the surface," was the
reply.

Taking it all in all, it was a very successful
ball, the greatest social success Sandycot had
as yet achieved. No palpable contretemjys had
occurred, and every one had received consideration.
Lady Albany and her daughters
had been gracious, and Lord Le Pole an
attentive steward. The dresses had been
fresh and in the extreme of fashion, not the
cast-offs of a London campaign, with the
VOL. m, 36

marks of active service on their facings, and
bearing in their passe tout ensemble an air of
indifference to the company.

Miss Prance, refulgent in vivid gold satin
and crimson cacti, ambled and surveyed in a
waltz with Lord Le Pole, but after the second
round, slightly giddy from such eccentric
caprioles, the latter proposed a tete-tete in the
little impromptu conservatory leading out of
the verandah. Sleek Miss Prance, bridling
with exaltation, and installed amidst towering
pots of foliage, treated her partner to some particular
confidences. From her he learnt that,
suddenly reversing his previous intentions,
the millionaire city knight had given out that
his nephew was to be his sole heir, and that
his pride at Ned's defeating a " real nob " in
the political arena was so great, he had been
heard to say that he should cut him out with
the Egbert heiress, that '' money should not
stand in his way."

Then Miss Prance from behind her fan,
with a confidential croak in her voice, asked
was it really true that Lord Le Pole was Mr.
Eawson's rival in that issue also ; to which

Lord Le Pole replied by fearing his taste took
a more ambitious direction, that he admired
women of presence  Miss Prance arched her
glossy neck  and being of an erratic turn of
mind looked for some one to check his impulses.
Miss Prance smiled as if already she
had the reins in her hand.

"My impression," she said in a half whisper,
' my impression is that the young lady flies
too high. She went great lengths with Mr.
Eawson, that I know for a fact ; indeed, I
have heard her call him ' Xed ; ' but I rather
think she has thrown him over, and ' between
two stools,' you know. I saw him last night
pass my window about nine o'clock with a
step like a conqueror, and not an hour later
he dashed under it again on his way to the
beach like a man off his head. I really was
terrified, and I shall be very glad when I hear
he is safe at Janitor Hall. Don't you think a
flirt the most odious object in nature, my
lord ? " to which his lordship replied :

Xot quite."

The great carriage, with its rough farm-horses,
stood waiting at the door of the town

362

hall, where the ball had been held, for its
precious consignment of gems and lace, in the
person of Miss Le Pole. It was not far off
three o'clock, and it was a twenty miles' drive
to the Manor House. Miss Le Pole, wrapped
in her satin cloak and soft woollen shawl
thrown hoodwink over her ornamental head,
came on her grand nephew Le Pole's arm. The
succeeding carriage was the Egbert one, and
Judy and her cousins stood in the deep porch
waiting their turn.

The light had already begun to fade in the
fair girl's eyes, and her cheeks had only the
faintest tinge of colour to relieve them from
dead white. The air was, if not chilly, just a
little fresh, and not a gleam of dawn showed
in the eastern sky. There was no outer sound
save the distant splash of the incoming tide
and the far-away murmur of its waters. Inside,
the Sandycot contingent, relieved from the
restraining presence of what it termed the
swells," had mustered in Sir Power de
Coverley, and from the merry shouts of
laughter, not the muffled peals alone permissible
in " good " society, it was evident

they were going to finish up with a notification.


With cigar in hand, ready for lighting,
Colonel Bolton stood beside Judy. He was
evidently, as Miss Prance would have said,
very far gone," but it was very doubtful if
Judy was aware of his presence. In vain he
bent to her ear ; all his usually successful
blandishments and the battery of his eyes
were to Judy as pantomime to the blind ; her
heart was still and cold within her motionless
breast.

You are tired," he said at last, not a little
chagrined.

His voice was natural. She started.

I suppose I am"" and she smiled. " This
has been unwonted dissipation for Sandycot."

Next year," he said sentimentally " you
will not be tired, only endured ; I wish I could
be fresh again."

Next year," she repeated mechanically as
the Egbert carriage replaced the cumbersome
vehicle which had lumbered off with its
valuable freight, " next year ; it sounds such
a long time, but some hours are longer," and

she bade him good night, but did not take his
offered hand.

Le Pole heard the low, sad words, and his
heart smote him. He made a step as if to
take the squire's place and hand her into the
carriage. Their eyes met ; in a flash all softness
vanished, and drawing her snowy hood
close under her chin she looked him in the
face with cool contempt, and without flurry or
haste took her seat beside Sybella.

There was not a more miserable man in
Sandycot, or Sandycot's wide country round,
that night, than the unsuccessful candidate
for Oxminster.

An early train in the morning took Elsie to
London, and by the afternoon such visitors as
had come for the express purpose of the ball
had taken their departure also. Of these only
Le Pole lingered. He had accompanied his
mother and one of his sisters in a call at Gilbert
Lodge, but only Sybella appeared. Dulsie was
complaining of renewed chill, and Doctor
Prance had ordered her to bed. Judy was off
on a long ride alone. By the last train he returned
to Nettlethorp without again seeing her.

Married passed redemption."

Time squire occasionally, and Dulsie most
mornings, heard from Mabella. The letters
were generally short and for the most part
taken up with details relating to the home-farm
and the conservatory, with now and then
the mention of some visitors. She rarely
mentioned her husband. Latterly she had
said that he found the country dull.

The time was drawing near for the family
to return to the Hall ; the squire was uneasy
about the crops, which were all cut ; he was
counting the days for his release.

About three days before that fixed for the
giving up of the Lodge to Mabella for her
future home, as arranged, the squire received
from her a longer letter than usual. After
perusing it he put it in his pocket, and bringing
his breakfast to an abrupt conclusion crept

silently away to his little study. He had aged
much of late, had suddenly, as it were, grown
down, and his nerve seemed broken. Dulsie,
Sybella, and Judy, too, noted these changes
with anxious hearts. They, too, longed to
return to the Hall, hoping that his old pursuits
Avould rouse his interest in life and perhaps
restore his waning vigour.

This same morning Judy also received a
letter with the postmark of Nettlethorp on
the envelope.

Who is your correspondent, Judy ? " asked
Sybella, who always, when lie had the
opportunity, examined the outsides of the
letters that came by post.

It is from Peters," she said. " Gloriana
has taken the gold medal;" but she did not
offer to give Sybella the letter to read. This
would not have passed without remark, but
at this instant the page brought Judy a
summons from the squire.

The horse, I suppose," said Dulsie to
Sybella.

I suppose so. How ill papa looks," she
added. " Mabella's vile conduct has struck

his death-blow. I suspect matters are not as
smooth as honey at the Hall. I'm quite prepared
to hear lie is a swindler."

The squire was sitting in his easy-chair.
He held in his hand a business-looking letter.

Judy dear," he said as the girl with loving
solicitude came close to his side, " Judy, my
child, poor ]arabella is in great trouble. I
want you to go to her  Dulsie is not able  she
is in a critical state with her heart, and Isabella
is out of the question  I do not feel
equal to it, so I am going to ask you to be
my deputy."

Judy's ready kiss assured the old man she
would be a willing: messenger, but she did
not give him the letter she had received from
Peters to read ; she contented herself with
telling him the contents in part. These were
already known to him.

"Major Tyler is in immediate want of two
thousand pounds," said the squire. "If he
does not get it at once, he "will be served with
a writ at the Hall. Mabella does not in so
many words ask me to give the money ; indeed
I am just a Httle doubtful if she really

wishes him to have it. I fancy, dear, she
has had her eyes opened, and is bitterly repenting
her folly. But I shall give it. The
disgrace of a writ was never known inside
the old keep, Judy, and if I can prevent it,
it shall not be while I live. But I do not
care to trust such a sum through the post.
Mabella may not get the post-bag, and as in
any case I only recognize her claim on me,
I wish to send the money direct to her own
hand, and so, dear, I want you to take it, and
to-day."

Judy said she would soon be ready, but
would cousin Egbert make it right with
Sybella ? Which cousin Egbert said he would
do.

Grant, the old butler, will accompany
you, my dear. He does not talk. If you
stay over tomorrow, write to me and give
Grant the letter to post."

All this Judy promised to do.

And oh, Judy," said the old man as she
left the room to get ready for her journey, " I
have had a letter from Lord Albany. It seems
that there was bare-faced bribery on Mr.

Eawson's side at the Oxminster election, and
he wishes Le Pole to appeal. He has been
busy collecting evidence ever since the ball.
I fear his own agent, Eout, sold him. It will
be an ugly case. But Le Pole, it appears, is
not willing. He does not wish his name
mixed up with squabbles, he says. It would
be an expensive matter, and as he did not
stand on pure conservative principles he
could not expect any help from the Carlton
Club, though he is a member."

I am sure," returned Judy, " Xed  that
is, Mr. Eawson  did not countenance anything
dishonourable. He is such a thorough
Englishman, cousin Egbert."

Yes, he is' a fine young fellow, I think ;
but, Judy dear, all corporations have their
own code of morals, but with so many bye-laws,
I begin to think, as Addison says, ' The
post of honour is a private station.' Custom,
too, that specious word, justifies wide divergence
from the simple but hard and fast
writing of Mount Sinai'; and to the old saying,
'Everything is fair in love and war,' politics
should be added."

"I'll tell you what, cousin Egbert," Judy
spoke hotly  was there really a wider gap
between her soul and Ned's ?  " a man who
would cheat at politics, would cheat at cards.
They are both games of skill, and if honouris
a mere scutcheon, its motto is sans
tacher

Judy was on what the squire was wont to
call ' her high horse." At such times she
was given to some very sharp-shooting, and,
some said, was deaf to what they called reason ;
but Judy was always deaf to the reason her
clear insight recognized as sophistry.

The squire smiled as he looked lovingly at
the enthusiastic girl.

I was always of opinion," he said, " that
Le Pole would have won had the fight been
fair, or if he had used his opponent's weapons,
but that means money."

"And," fired off Judy, "dishonesty. No,
no ; with him, at any rate, it is noblesse
oblige''

She stayed a moment, half turned to leave
to get ready for her journey. Her young
face had a touch of age in the fret of the

mouth and the knit of the brow, her eyes
had a questioning surprise.

Cousin Egbert," she said in a strange
voice, half pain, half pride, " can birth have
anything to do with it all ? "

The " all " bracketed the two men she
did not specify ; she trusted to her cousin's
intuition, which did not fail him.

Don't you know what your favourite poet
Burns says ?

' The king may mak' a belted knight,
A marquis, duke, and a' that ' ''

Yes, yes," she interrupted him, just a little
impatiently, " I know no one can make a
man honest if he is not so in himself; but if
birth has given him a noble name, traditions,
and old family property, don't you think he
knows that more is required of him than of
the man who is what Sybella calls ' his own
architect ' ? "

It was the squire's turn to interrupt, and he
did so gently, but gravely.

By whom, Judy ? " he said.

She did not answer ; he did for her.

"It is a poor life's work when the world is
the only taskmaster, child."

Judy went impulsively up to the old man
and kissed him ; the fret and question gone
from her expressive face, which mirrored her
heart as a clear lake mirrors the sunlit sky.

Only one word," she said, " and then I'm
off."

She was trying to speak lightly, but the
squire saw she felt keenly.

You don't believe, do you, that Ned knew
of this jobbery ? "

No, I think he was so busy ' grating ' "
he smiled meaningly  " that he had no time
to look after his agent. He was fresh to the
thing, too, not up to the tricks of the trade ;
but, Judy "  and he was serious now  " his
election bills must have opened his eyes."

"And then?" she questioned what already
her heart had answered.

Again Bobbin Burns," he replied.

'' ' Where'er ye feel your honour grip,
Let that be aye your border.' "

Sadly Judy went to attire herself for the
journey.

The prize was great, it was won ; Lis
intentions had been honourable ; he could
justify himself to himself, but he was not
called on to suffer for the ill-doing: of others."
This, she instinctively felt, would be the
argument ; to which her heart gave answer,
Better to suffer than to gain by ill-doing."

Then she wondered, with a sorely wounded
spirit, what Le Pole would have done had he
been in Ked"s place. She knew people called
him a jurist, and then she thought a purist a
very noble thing.

Before leaving the room she re-read the
letter she had received from Peters that
morning;. It ran :  -

Honoured Miss, 

'' This is to tell you, in hopes I will bethe
first in the field, as Gloriana has doomed
in first at the Show, as was to be expected,
but all the same what we all bees proud
about. The gold medal's main handsome.

But, honoured Miss, I fear as poor little
Tim's having' a bad time of it. Giles doomed
to me, and ses as how he is no scholar, or

he'd have writ you himself, he would ; he ses,
as he alius does, as the little beast's only
garment, but he knows you're set on him
almost as Miss Egbert, her as is Mrs. Tyler
now, an' it's on his mind to tell you as there's
mischief meant him, meaning Tim ; so,
honoured Miss, if it could fit as you could
come an' see Gloriana after the Show,
which was yesterday, you might take Tim
along of you. He bees a rare one at
rats, an' he's never kantankerus to them as
is good to him, and for the matter of that
as is good in themselves, begging pardon,
honoured Miss, for any reflex shuns on the
family, leastways them as belongs to the
family now  more's the pity.

Your humble servant,

Ted Peters,
Stateroom to Squire Egbert."

If he does," said Judy as she thrust the
letter into a drawer and locked it, " if he
does" she doubled her little fist "I'll
yes, by Jove, I will  I'll tear his eyes
out."

Judy, considerably relieved, took lier way
downstairs.

By the squire's direction Grant telegraphed
to the housekeeper, Mrs. Carter, who informed
Mabella of Judy's approach.

Oh, then," said Mabella, " I'll wait till
after luncheon to go to Giles' cottage. Miss
Judy will be sure to want to see him. He's
much better, the major says."

She may not be here much before two,
ma'am. ]mr. Carter said it would be just a
chance their catching the first train."

Judy is coming, Geoffrey," said Mabella
to Major Tyler, who entered the room as Mrs.
Carter left it.

The handsome major was in desJiahille, and
it did not become him. He had, in fact,
not lout risen. This was the first time
Mabella had seen him that day. An old
velveteen shooting-coat, bracelets trousers,
and crumpled shirt composed his attire. His
feet were inclosed in tarnished Turkey
slippers, and on his head was an equally
tarnished gold-embroidered smoking-cap  he
had been smoking. A dilapidated air hung
VOL. m. 37

round the entire man ; an endured, discontented
roue look stamped his face, which, lacking the
auxiliary of make-up, showed tell-tale marks
of unsuspected years.

The deuce," he said, lounging over to his
wife's writing-table and examining some
envelopes lying on the latter. " What's up ?
You've heard from your father, then. Is he
ioinof to do it ? "

Geoffrey, I have already told you I will
not allow you to touch my letters."

Mabella rose and locked the drawer of the
table, snatching an envelope out of her
husband's hands.

It is only menials who pry into other
people's letters."

"Heyday, my line lady," returned the
major, coolly catching Mabella's wrist with
one hand, while with the other he forced the
letter from her grasp, " ' other people ' indeed !
lay down the law, will you ? " Throwing
the letter down he secured both hands.
Now, Mrs. Tyler, one word for all. I may
not be master here yet, but I am your
master. I have you hard and fast. Do you

understand?" lie gripped her closer. "The
law can't help you, all you have is mine, and
you are mine till death us do ijart.""

He released her. She was white with rage,
but with a strong effort she repressed her
anger. The very semblance of civility had
long ceased between the pair, but Mabella
had a powerful will  she could afford to
wait. Bitterly she had paid for the one
weakness of her nature, but she had vowed
that she only should be the sufferer, that
during her father's life she would not distress
him by vain repining, she would " dree her
weird." She turned to him now, not a tear
in her bitter eyes. Since her marriage she
had shed more than during her sixty years
of maidenhood.

' I am as well aware of the law's limits as
you can be," she said, " and I counsel you to
keep to them, that is all. If there is anything
to be done about this money it must be
through a solicitor. I will have nothing todo
with your money matters."

He rang the bell.

The footman answered it.

372

Brandy and soda-water, and get me a
devilled biscuit."

The servant looked at Mabella as if for
authority to execute the major's order.

If Major Tyler has breakfasted, take what
he wants to his own room ; if he has not,
serve breakfast in the dining-room for him."

"Be d d if you do," shouted the major ;

bring it here, or I'll teach you a lesson you
won't soon forget," and he made a menacing
step forward.

Major Tyler was six feet high, the footman
some five feet ten, athletic and broad. The
major's shoulders were narrow, so was his
chest. With a cool appraising stare, but
apparent respect, the man inclined his
powdered head and turned on his heel.

At that instant Grant appeared. The
grave old servitor, for one astounding
moment off his balance, caught at the
handle of the door, and by so doing knocked
against the major, who with belligerent intent
was hastening after the receding footman.

"Ah, Grant," cried Mabella, "I'm so glad
to see you."

She absolutely quivered in her endeavour
to speak calmly.

Has Miss Judy come ? "

At Judy's name the major cast a hasty
look at his attire and vanished by another
door.

After a hasty toilet, which advantageously
metamorphosed the outer man, he resumed
his cigar and struck across the fields to Giles'
cottage " to bring the little minx," he said to
himself, " the latest intelligence of the dog,
that she might be convinced of his solicitude."

Grant said Judy had come, but had stopped
at the low gate, where Peters had been watching
for her, and had gone with him to see
Tim. She would come across the fields after
her visit, which she desired Grant to say
should only detain her a few minutes.

Then Mabella asked how the squire was
looking.

Grant shook his head, and said he thought
the old man had aged greatly of late, adding
that Miss Dulsie, too, seemed poorly.

Mabella looked wretched.

My father has been such a hale man for

his years," she said, *' any little change shows
more. He will soon pick up when he gets
home ; " but her voice betrayed how little her
belief went with her words. Then, almost
apologetically, she continued :

The major has been so used to a barrack
life he has not fallen into quiet country ways
yet. He does not understand civilian servants,
they are so different to rough soldier
ones. It is dull, too, for him here."

It'll upset the squire terrible," Grant said
to Mrs. Carter after his interview with Mabella.
Why, she's lost a good stone, she has, and
she's that nervous I thought she'd have
plumped down in her chair, only she caught
at the table, when the major slammed the
door. He'll be her death."

"Not he," cried Mrs. Carter, "Miss Egbert"
among themselves the servants never gave
Mabella her dearly-bought " Mrs."" Miss
Egbert has a wonderful spirit. He'll find
himself in Queer Street some fine morning.
Dignity Mansion's no casual for tramps, Mr.
Grant."

Grant nodded grimly

He don't dare to treat her bad, does lie ? "
he asked, voluntarily doubling his list.

"They've had awful high words, they have,"
she answered, " and John "  the footman 
"he came running to me one day to say as he
heard a chair knocked over, so I went up and
listened at the door. It was the dining-room,
but all was quiet, only now and then a sob
like. I waited a bit and heard him go out
at the far door, then I made bold and went
in, and, poor thing, she was crying ; but the
chair had been picked up and all was orderly.
I asked her if she called me ; she looked
shamed at me seeing her in such a way, but
she saw I'd heard something, and she said,
not minding my question, ' as the major was
terrible peppery, like all military gentlemen
was, and she wasn't used, she wasn't, to rough
words, but it would blow over, she'd settle
down in time ; ' and then she said, poor soul,
as he had French blood in him, comet of old
French counts, and ' French blood,' says she,
'and English don't always mix well.' 'French
counts ! ' says I to myself, ' the poor thing ! ' "

"Mrs. Carter," said Grant with grave concern,

" it's a bad job, it is. You may well
say ' poor thing ! ' She wants to make us
believe as her 'electro-plate's Guildhall'"

Never mind," cried Mrs. Carter, " she's
lots of spirit left yet. She always was master-some,
in a kindly way though, and main
proud. If she finds out what he comes from,
ironmonger "  she lowered her voice 
"Tubbs says he'll get his marching orders."

And," said Grant, " I hope I may live to
hear 'em."

How many cowards bear upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and Mars''

Goes' cottage-was not far from what was
called the low crate of the Osbert demesne,
and Judy, her feet winged by solicitude for
the merry and loving little companion of many
a frolic and ramble, soon reached it.

Giles had just finished his dinner and was
smoking his post-prandial pipe, sitting within
his cottage porch. Peters had followed 1 Judy
at some distance.

Extinguishing his pipe with his thumb, the
old shepherd hastily went out to greet the
"little miss," his furrowed weather-beaten
visage grimly joyous.

Judy shook him by the hand.

Oh, Giles," she said in not an overspread
voice, " Pm so glad you let me know ; he
won't die, will he ? "

Giles shook his head.

Judy followed him into the cottage. Thereon
a soft pillow, lay the little dog. He was
stretched full length and his tongue hunof
out of his mouth. Every now and then a
quiver of pain passed over his loins. His
eyes were shut, but as Jud3's foot crossed the
threshold the little stump tail moved.

He knows me," she said, the tears rolling
down her cheeks.

At her voice, with an effort that seemed to
strain every fibre of his body, Tim tried to
struoforle to his feet, uttering: a feeble whine,
then sank down and lay motionless.

She bent down over him, calling him by
every pet term in her vocabulary. She passed
her hand with mesmeric touch over his sleek
sides ; he gave no sign of recognition.

"Oh, Giles," she said, "he is dead."

Noa, miss," said Giles, " but it'll be a
good job when un is, vor himself, poor cowl
ov hyn. Un took bad after un vitals
yesterday, an', miss, we sent for un, an' I seed
how it vor with a clap o' alia eye, an' fetched
hyn here. I made fitted it vor fits, an' huntley
calls the major, hern husband, un ses

as it vor noa wonder, as 'im vor vet like a ox.
But dante take on zo, little miss, un ain't
suffering now, un's just spent. 0, Miss Judy
dear, it bennet right," as the tender-hearted
girl's sobs came quick, " un's but a dog, an'
many a un I've seen rattled in my day.
There's a many thing's in the Almighty's
world az bees to be put out o' tha way at
times. Fern's not like uz."

"And well for them they're not like us,"
she cried. " I tell you what, Giles, I'd rather
be that little garment, as you used to call him,
agonizing out its life in cruel torture, than the
man that did it. Poor little, loving, faithful
Tim ; he'd have fought a lion for me, Giles,"
and she bent down and kissed the dog between
his ears, which moved in magnetic sympathy.
Peters stood behind Judy. More than once
he drew his cufF-sleeve across his eyes. The
shepherd's wife now brought a cup with some
brandy and milk, and Judy with a tea-spoon
poured a little into the animal's hot inflamed
mouth. It revived him. He opened his eyes
and whined in recognition of his loved
playmate.

Perhaps," she cried, '' he'd rally if he saw
his house."

At the word " house " Tim gave a feeble
growl.

Oh, Peters, would you get his house ? "

In a second Peters vanished. Judy sat
down on a low stool close beside the dog.
Giles returned to his seat in the porch, but
not to smoke, and Mrs. Giles to her chair by
the fire. Once or twice Judy renewed the
brandy and milk, continuing the gentle stroking,
which seemed to soothe the poor animal.
Suddenly he showed uneasiness and growled.
Not all Judy's coaxing and endearments could
quiet him, but he was too feeble to do more
than growl. Then Judy heard some one
talking to Giles ; her cheeks grew fiery red
she recognized Major Tyler's voice, and
listened.

Tin's almost gone, un want trouble narra
one no more," said Giles gruffly, evidently in
answer to an inquiry.

"Mrs. Tyler would not take my advice,"
said the major in a conciliatory tone, " she
would feed him on meat."

Un's bin used to it therein vive years
to my knowledge," was the surly reply.

I'm very sorry for the little brute," continued
the major, "and I'm obliged to you
for your kindness to it ; you've done all you
can, I know," and he slipped two sovereigns
into Giles' hand.

Giles looked at them, stretching out his
rough palm as if it held in it some obnoxious
insect. Then with an action of disgust he let
them drop at his visitor's feet. They rolled
into a corner and glistened there.

The old shepherd rose proudly, keeping his
hat on. " Thou bist a rare wosbird, th' bist,"
he said between his teeth ; and then in a raised
voice, " When a wants tha zy quire's guineas,
I'll get 'em from himself ; but man to man, sir,
trucks not tha way I'd settle scores with tha
likes o' you."

The major hearing a foot on the gravel
turned round and saw Peters, heated with
running, approaching with Tim's house in his
hand.

"The little fiend," he thought, "it's
better."

Tien lie entered the cottage. Immediately
after him came Peters.

Major Tyler ! " cried Judy, springing to
her feet.

The major turned white, but with what
bravado he could muster he staggered up
and held out his hand.

Judy looked at it, then with a face of
mingled scorn and loathing she deliberately
turned her back.

An exclamation from Peters recalled her
startled senses. She turned to the dog ; it
had struggled on to its legs, every hair on
its back bristling. Xo sound for the moment
came from him. His poor swollen tongue
hung from his inflamed jaws, and it was
evident he was nearly blind, but he sniffed
eagerly and staggered towards his cruel
enemy.

With an almost supernatural scare in his
face the major jumped on to an oak chest.

"Tim, Tim, mv little darlington cried
Judy.

The dog did not heed, he did not hear her.
He had reached the oak chest.

Give me this house, Peters," lie cried.

Timothy Timotheus ! "

He gave no sign that he heard her.

Tim, Tim," and in her excitement the old
tone of command rang out clear and sharp,
some one has taken your house'"

The last word struck the highest note,
and Tim's spirit came to him with a rush.
He turned, growled, and with a desperate
effort leaped into his castle.

Judy carried it tenderly to the table. The
brave little fellow had fallen over on his side,
but with the old action, his forelegs stiff and
straight before him, and faint growls, showed
he still lived.

Another minute and they ceased.

Tim, my little man," Judy cried, " you
know me ? "

She held her hand to his mouth ; he just
feebly raised his head, tried to hck the soft
little palm, and died.

And outside, lying on the gravel in the sun,
Beck and Sam lifted their voices in concert
and howled.

Only a little dog lay there dead. To some

it had been a very disagreeable dog, and when
the circumstances under which it died had
been partially forgotten, there were many
who would own to a feeling of relief. But to
close observers of canine nature, and to lovers
of the race like Judy, a dog like Tim possessed
a distinct individuality and qualities that
brought it within the range of human psychology.
Whence came its faith, its loyalty, its
devotion, its keen insight into character, its
abhorrence, as in the major's instance, of a
foul human soul? Whence, too, came the
wonderful intelligence?  how far removed
from reason who could divine ?

As Judy stood beside the " unconsidered
clay" of the being that, denied human obligation
of life, had yet paid the penalty of life 
death, her heart rose up in rebellion against
man's arrogant assumption that for such
existences there is no compensation. What,
how, when, where, not even imagination could
shadow forth. All she felt, all she stanch
maintained, was that nothing was ever formed
to be destroyed, and that He who gave even a
dog the instinct  to call it by no higher name

to discern, if but in part, between good and
evil, had an ulterior purpose beyond man's
finite ken.

Far beyond the doctrine of mere schism
her reverent soul soared. That she intuitively
discerned to be materialism, for if it were a
universal soul that animated all living: beings,
it was that, and that only, that regulated
their actions, and not the individual organization.
That would be to subjugate spirit to
matter. And so her first keen pang, as of
actual bereavement, had in it the unconscious
recognition of a higher claim on her affections
than that of a purposeless physical automaton.


Just for the first bitter moment Judy gave
way to a burst of weeping, then suddenly
turning round she walked up to the major,
and placing herself right in the doorway
intercepted him as he was slinking off, Giles
and Peters beside her. The light fell full on
his face, which was white with fear. Her
little hand was clenched, and her eyes,
through tears, danced in fire.

Beck and Sam had drawn up to heel beside
VOL. m. 38

Giles, and now stood growling and threatening.


"You dastardly coward," lie cried, "it
was your hand that did it. The little, trusting,
helpless dog  you were afraid of him
because he saw into your base soul. You
cruel fiend, I'll never touch your hand,
I'll never lay down my head under the
roof that covers yours, and when cousin
Egbert dies Til tell Glabella. The brave little
heart"  she dashed her tears aside; "but
you have gained a victory, a living cur is
better than a dead lion."

White with rage the major raised his
hand as if to strike. Giles and Peters
closed in.

It is a lie," he gasped.

Out with you ! " she cried, stepping aside

to let him pass, " and be quick or " She

stooped and caught the two collies each by
an ear. Giles gave an involuntary grunt of
assent, and the dogs with a deep bay sprang
forward, but her hold was firm, and at a
Down !" from Giles they dropped to the
floor.

Out ! " she cried again, and with a scream
of terror the major fled.

Judy did not undeceive Mabella regarding

the cause of the dog's death. She allowed

her to believe it had died of apoplexy. But

no inducement could make lier rest at the

Hall that night. She insisted on returning to

Sandycot by an evening train. For two hours

she and Mabella held confidential converse, in

which the latter told her relative all that was

in her soul, and was not a little comforted by

the brave girl's words of cheer and hope. It

was agreed between them that Mabella should

go to London next day, accompanied by Mrs.

Carter, but unknown to Major Tyler, and that

she should consult a solicitor about taking up

the bill. A slight difficulty as to what solicitor

arose. The one who had for years been

employed by her father, she said, was out of

the question. She could not so humiliate

herself, it must be a stranger.

Judy suggested Messrs. Eaymont, Eout

and Eally. Mr. Eajmont, she said, was much

esteemed by Lord Albany, and to him Mabella

.determined to go.

382

In a fortnight, perhaps less, the squire and
his daughters were to leave Sandy cot for the
Hall, when Mabella was to take their place at
the Lodge.

"And, Mabella dear," said Judy, "perhaps
when he finds that no advantage can come
to him except through you, things may go
smoother. He has paid some visits with you,
has he not? "

"Yes, and he made himself most agreeable.
There is one comfort to me through it all,
that he is a gentleman by birth. I suppose
Frenchmen make very indifferent husbands,
and he has a great deal of French blood in him."

Mabella spoke as if she were arguing herself
into belief against conviction.

Did you go to the Grange ? " Judy asked
hesitatingly.

Yes "  Mabella was too absorbed in her
own affairs to notice the flush on the girl's
cheek  " Lord Albany was civil to him, but no
more. He got on, however, with Lady Olivia
capitally, they seem to have a great many
mutual acquaintances ; he has been so much in
society, you see. But the country is quite

empty, it lias been very dull work. However,
Judy, I am not going to sit down and lament my
fate ; I mean to make the best of it while papa
lives, at any rate. If only I can keep things
quiet ! For his own sake one would think he
will keep up appearances before the world ;
that is all I ask of him, all I want of him, for
oh Judy, Judy, I have made a terrible mistake."

I think," said Judy, " you ought to have
some one to live with you ; it would be a protection
against his temper in every way indeed."

I daresay Dulsie will stay a good deal
with me, she is so gentle and good-humoured."

Dulsie has been very poorly of late, she
complains of her heart a good deal."

Ah, she has done that ever since that
rheumatic fever she had, you remember."

She has been worse lately, Mabella.
Cousin Egbert wants her to consult a London
doctor, and I think she will. She misses you
sadly."

The major did not appear. The footman,
on Mabella's questioning him, said he had
gone out riding and had left word he would
not be home until late, that Mrs. Tyler was

not to wait dinner for him. So Judy and
Mabella lead early dinner together in peace.
After dinner they proceeded to Giles' cottage,
laden with flowers from the conservatory and
garden.

By Judy's direction a deep hole had been
made under a venerable oak-tree, and there
poor little Tim was buried, house and all. He
had not been ejected even by death. Judy
covered him with flowers till the house could
hold no more, and then it was lowered down
on a bed of fragrant exotics, and covered in
by many a rare bud and bloom. Judy stood
till the turf had been replaced and all trace
of the burial had been removed. She then,
with many a pitiful tear, carved his name and
date of death on the trunk of the tree.

Mabella had watched the innocent loving
girl with sad eyes, but hardly for the dog s
death, for her own troubles seemed to have
blunted her feelings. Perhaps she insensibly
felt that one great and constant cause of
irritation to her husband was removed ; but
her heart was very sore in a dumb way, and
she wished she had left her faithful little friend

at Egbert Lodge. After a hasty visit to
Gloriana, Judy took her departure for Sandy-cot.
At Nettlethorp she telegraphed to the
squire to expect her home that night.

That which is won ill will never wear well,
For there is a curse attends it which will waste it."

Mr. Eout was a bachelor. It was popularly
supposed that he had never succumbed to the
tender passion, though on more than one
occasion he had shown symptoms of the
malady. His cure had always been effected
at the critical point when expectations of the
momentous question were indicated. But
Mr. Eout was no longer susceptible to feminine
allurements ; he had no time, he said.

Very much at his ease, his day's work over,
Mr. Eout lived in his freehold villa, the Pines,
at Clapham. It was a very comfortable villa,
inclosed in a high obscuring wall, with an
extensive garden, greenhouses, and good stabling.
A first-rate cook and housekeeper and
two servants, one a man, made up his establishment.
Mr. Eout very seldom saw company.
When he did, in the shape of a big dinner ora

recherche supper, business ends were to be
furthered. Hospitality pure and simple was
never exercised by Mr. Eaymont's partner.

But Mr. Eout had refined tastes. His collection
of old china was unique, also of rare
manuscripts and scarce editions of books.
He had, too, some valuable pictures. The
furniture of the Pines was not modern, it was
antique, and in the bric-a-brac market of
money value. Everything Mr. Eout had,
possessed a money value.

There was, however, one room in the Pines
that was up to date in the matter of furnishing,
and a very elegant, beautiful room it was.
So also was the bedroom which opened out
from it.

A great artist of the day had painted the
panels, and a high art decorator had finished
the ornamentations. Satin stuffs, velvet-pile
carpets, downy cushions, and pillowy lounges
told of unsparing lavishness. But nothing
smacked of the upholsterer. Exquisite taste
fitted things to each other, blending colour
and design.

These two rooms were not often occupied,

and then for limited periods at a time, and
by a lady. To-day preparations had been
made for the arrival of their tenant, Elsie
Eber.

Mr. Eout came home sooner than usual,
brinfino with him a basket of fruit from
Covent Garden.

He dressed carefully for dinner that day,
and the somewhat sombre sumptuous rooms
had over them all a festive air of expectation.
And yet the coming guest was but a sister 
Mr. Eout's step-sister. They had owned the
same mother ; but except in affection the
brother and sister had nothing in common.

Abram Eout was the elder by some fifteen
years. A clever business man, with keen
acumen, he yet was uncultured, understanding
only the money value of art and literature.
But he knew in both what made success. In
the conduct of his two flourishing papers it
was he who had chosen their editors, he alone
who had organized their economy, and he
who virtually held the tiller. He knew the
popular taste. It was characteristic of Mr.
Eout that he never asked advice of any one.

he was essentially self-reliant and very seldom
made mistakes, never glaring ones. If lie had
been connected with some doubtful transactions
his name had not transpired. Mr.
Eout, in action, was always cap-a-pie.

Only one person knew him thoroughly,
though more than one were doubtful, and
that was his half-sister Elsie.

All the affection of which his nature was
capable was centred in his beautiful and
gifted sister, and yet he was aware that she
read him closely.

The passionate temperament of the mother
she had inherited ; Abram, like his father, was
cool and calculating, with no passion save
that of money getting.

He had, however, a sybarite soul, and lived
luxuriously. Passion, genius, beauty, independence
 fateful possessions in woman,
perilous equipments for the battle of life,
where there were none to guide or restrain.
Elsie had chosen her own career, which being
utterly opposed to that her brother would
have had her follow, they drifted amicably
asunder, but meeting as occasion served, and

keeping up an affectionate, and, on Elsie's
part, confidential correspondence.

And as wealth increased with Abram he
made a " bower," as he expressed it, for his
only love, his sister. And there, whensoever
her spirit failed, or her heart grew weary,
Elsie found rest for the sole of her foot.

No one was ever allowed to occupy that
pretty bower, it was kept sacred for the one
pure, true affection of Abram Eout's sordid
soul.

There was one point of wide divergence
between the brother and sister  their faith.

Abram still followed, in considerably
modified fashion, that of his race.

Elsie, still jealously claiming for herself the
distinctive term of Jewess, had long since
worshipped at the Christian's shrine. This
had not in any way affected her brother. He
was simply indifferent.

Born a Jew, he remained a Jew, only easing
his obligations by joining the sect which, still
clinofino- to the traditions of their fathers,
allow themselves the broad margin expressed
by the title of Modern Jew. But in the whole

matter of the law's obligations, that lie was
of " Abraham's seed " was all-sufficient for
Abram Eout.

Elsie had an almost morbidly independent
spirit, and thonqli early in her career she had
lost, to within a mere trifle, her comfortable
fortune, she had not only never appealed to
her brother for aid, she had refused it when
with real and loving solicitude he had
pressed it.

She had talents, she said ; it had been
through her own fault her patrimony had
been wasted ; she would do what others less
gifted than she had done, " make her own
way," and she did.

After the interregnum of a year's unremitted
study Elsie Eber came before the public
as a dramatic reciter, and gained for herself
fame equal to that won by the most favoured
actress of her day, and fame of that quality
means wealth. But Elsie was not wealthy.

Her unsuspected charities, far stretching
and many, kept her reserve fund from
acquiring any but the proportions required
by common prudence.

Apart from lier vocation, Elsie led a life of
retirement, spending her leisure with the few
friends she had admitted to her intimacy, for
it was for Elsie to choose.

Friends in the heyday of her fame were
many.

In this way Mrs. Horseman and she had
come together, and the years as they swept by
but drew closer the bond of their friendship.
They understood and they trusted each other.

Many a coveted matrimonial prize of society
was laid at Elsie Eber's feet. Many a true
heart sought hers, but hers was dead, though
they knew it not ; love in that sense had set
for Elsie for ever.

Love on her horizon had had a sudden,
fierce, eastern dawn, then had come the glare,
the glitter, the scorch, and, with the fever-heat
still in her blood, the quick eyeless sunset and
night.

But the essential soul of her higher self had
risen triumphant on the ruins of her lower
self, and earth held no purer, nobler spirit
than that in the fragile lovely embodiment of
Elsie Eber.

At last the epicurean meal was ended, and
Elsie was alone with her brother. A great
lamp With mellow shade lighted softly the
luxurious room, glittering with plate and glass,
and rich with many a canvas from the master-hands
of art.

Wines sparkled on the table, and luscious
fruits clustered round an ice pyramid in the
centre.

A soft evening air came in from a far
window, and in the distance the ring of
evening chime and bells.

Abram's toilet was careful, his look placid
and satisfied. Prosperity, plenty, peace, alliterative
filled his senses.

"No, Abram dear, to-night," Elsie said;
we will begin and finish our business talk
to-night. After that is over we can enjoy
each other so much better."

He filled himself a glass of old Burgundy
and drained it. He was a temperate man, but
to-night what he had drunk would have tried
the head of a seasoned toper. If it tried his
he did not show it.

First and foremost, Abram, about this

bill," said Elsie ; " how has it ended ? I see
you paid the two thousand to my credit at
Soult's. I left Sandycot rather abruptly,
intending to come direct here, for I have
matters of moment to speak to you about, but
I had to meet urgent appeals from Glasgow,
some hospital they want to build, so I went
there and was detained beyond my calculations.
Mrs. Tiler died, you told me, but
your letter was hurried, so you gave no
particulars."

Abram briefly recapitulated the circumstances
of the bill as narrated to him by the
major's sister.

She made no remark, did not seem surprised
at the baseness and dishonesty, not to
say cruelty, of the transaction. She only
said :

Then he paid this man Davis to hold the
bill over. He spent the two thousand at
Monaco of course ? "

Abram nodded.

And latterly he has kept Davis quiet by
Miss Egbert."

Yes, but Davis will wait no longer ; by

this he has served a "writ. I suppose Mr.
Egbert will pay ? "

Yes, without doubt. The marriage is a
terrible blow to the family."

"I thought, Elsie, you would have interfered
in time. Do you not think you ought to have
done so ? He'll have it all his own way now,
the dastard."

I was too late, Abram. I had made up
my mind to expose him. He had some such
idea, I think, for his statements made Miss
Egbert positively rude to me, and I am sure
that it was that dread made him persuade her
to marry him in secret. Some wonderfully
ingenious fabrication ; poor woman, what a
waking ! "

Do you mean to let him alone
now?"

For the present, or until a necessity for
my interference arises. It would be a dreadful
ordeal, Abram."

I wouldn't," he said. " She has plenty of

friends to protect her. The squire is no fool.

I wonder he didn't try it on with pretty

Miss Aylmere. She is to have the property

VOL. ni. 39

eventually. But I suppose he could not
afford to wait."

'soh, dear little Judy?" said Elsie. "From
the first she recoiled from him, though she
was fascinated by his cleverness and apparent
force. She is very unsophisticated "

There was silence for some minutes. Elsie
looked careworn and sad. Abrani was not at
his ease.

' Abram," she said at last, " our paths
have lain apart, but you have been a true
and a loving brother to me. You have stood
by me unflinchingly in my hours of terrible
need, and you have never reproached me."

For what, Elsie ? "

Dear, you know. Had I listened to your
warning words, how different my life might
have been."

"That is all over and gone, Elsie, and you
are young still, and even more beautiful now
than then."

I never had a secret from you, Abram. I
have always trusted you, and looked up to
you. You value my good opinion, don't you,
dear ? "

She had slipped from her chair and now
knelt at his knee.

"Above everything," he answered in a
somewhat faint voice, as his arm involuntarily
encircled her waist.

It is not about him I have come to you,
Abram," she said, speaking soft and low, " it
is about yourself and the Oxminster election.
Dear, you must make restitution."

He started, drawing his arm away. She
clasped him round his knees.

Do you ask me how I know ? It is not in
my power to tell you, sufficient for us both
that / do know. Lord Le Pole lost his seat
through bribery; you were his trusted agent.
His election bills were moderate, one thousand
two hundred in all. Abram, if you do not
repay Lord Albany that sum, / shall. Money
has been your snare. The love of it grows
on you. It blinds your sense of honour. It
will lead you into some terrible pitfall some
day. Oh, brother darling, draw up in time.
Listen to my warning, though I would not to
yours ; oh, darling, let me save you from
yourself. Hush, Abram," she continued,

392

catching this hand and holding it tightly in
her clasp, 'you know my strength of will of
old. What I have said I will do. I have no
one in all the wide world but you. Friends,
loving friends, I have, but only one brother,
and you know too well I can never own a
nearer tie. I am cut off from any bond
closer than a brother's. If you fail me, I
shall be desolate indeed."

Again she wound her arms round his knees,
looking up into this face with mournful, pleading
eyes.

What would you have me do, Elsie ? "
he faltered, averting; his eves.

Abram, which do you love best, me or
your money ? "

He was not a demonstrative man, nor of
a loving nature, but he was a man of one
dominating affection, that for his sister. And
the very concentration of that affection, excluding
as it did every other object, gave ita
force unknown to love, however strong,
divided among many.

Elsie," he whispered, " you can do with
me as you will."

She rose and brought a blotter, with pen
and ink. Xo more words were spoken, but
Abram Eout signed a cheque for one thousand
two hundred pounds and placed it in his
sister's hands.

A few days later Lord Albany received
notice from his bankers that a sum of that
amount had been placed to his credit by some
person unknown. A letter inclosing the
money, in Bank of England notes, had been
given ill at the door of the bank. The letter
was in no name. And Elsie never told her
brother how much of the transactions relating
to the Oxminster election had come to her
knowledge. A very sensible portion of the
wrong done had now been repaired, and
though personally her magnanimity would
have carried her to the height of full and
perfect restoration, regardless of consequence
to herself,it stopped short at jeopardy to Abram.
Her brother was Elsie's vulnerable point.

Lord Le Pole is going to petition, Abram,"
she said, resuming her seat.

We have received no intimation of it," he
said sharply.

He told me a fortnight ao that his father
was bent on it. They have been collecting
evidence at Oxminster."

They have been collecting evidence," he
repeated in a husky voice. " Why, Elsie, we
were their agents ; they would naturally
employ us. You are misinformed."

Xo, dear, I am not. They do not mean
to employ you."

Has Eaymont heard this ? "

I do not know, Abram," she whispered ;
I would retire from the firm. You are rich
enough."

Money has nothing to do with it. You
would not have me plead guilty before I am
accused. I may have been half-hearted in
Le Pole's cause, for I am a liberal, out and
out, but  but "

Better you should retire," she said quietly
at your own instance than Mr. Eaymont'.s.
The terms of your partnership allow of your
doing so at any time, even without notice, do
they not ? "

Six months' notice," he answered faintly.

Or a forfeit ? " she added pointedly.

One thousand," he said.

Abram," she continued, " you must pay
the forfeit, and you must take your name off
the roll of attorneys."

A servant brought in coffee. She drank
hers gladly. It was cafe noir and it gave her
the stimulus she needed.

"Elsie, what have you heard?" he began,
trying hard to assume a look of astonishment ;
he only succeeded in looking bewildered and.
dismasted.

She bent towards him and kissed his brown.
leaving her hand in his.

My brother," she whispered, " my beloved-brother,
there can never be anvthinsf but love
between you and me. / can never see yoa
but with eyes of love. It is your head, not
your heart, that is at fault. We have been
too much apart of late years. My profession
is beginning to pull upon me, I seem to long
for rest ; for, dear, I am not so strong as I was.
You are rich. I am independent. I want
you to leave , England to come with me to
Italy. We can buy a beautiful home thereon
the Arno, or anywhere you may choose,

and I will be always with you. You said you
loved me better than your money. I will
never hear his name there, and you, dear,
you will be honoured and trusted, for you
will be good and true away from this soul-destroying
money-getting. You have been
too much alone, Abram."

She spoke with her eyes on the ice
pyramid, as if curiously watching its slow
decrease. Some warm drops fell on the hand
that lay in Abram's, and she remembered a
day, ten years ago, when such drops fell quick
and many on a pale face from which all the
freshness, the joy, the hope of youth had been
dashed at one blow  her face. But she did
not flinch now. Her love for her brother was
fixed in her resolution to save him from himself
; for this she would sacrifice the calling
so congenial to her nature, would expatriate
herself, and cut herself off from the friends
she loved. No half measures could save him,
and though she shared the pain she inflicted,
she did not spare it.

She waited motionless. She knew a violent
struggle was going on between mammon no

the one part, fear and love on the other. It
seemed to her as if she could follow the tortuous
reasoning, as if she were looking into
her brother's naked soul. Perhaps she was.
The spiritual part of a human soul has a
vision beyond mental ken.

But the victory was to be hers. She never
doubted it. Sitting calmly there she felt, ashe
recognized it in all its strength, her occult
force mastering the recalcitrant opposers.
Gradually his hand grasped hers firmer ; electric
sympathy and strength passed from her
soul to his. She returned the pressure oreutlv.

ST c ./

Had her fingers speech ? He grew calmer
and very still.

Elsie," he said at last, clearly and without
a quiver, " look at me, dear."

She did, with a smile of proud trust and
love.

I will do what you wish."

That was all he said. She had conquered.
As if by tacit agreement the subject was
dropped, and Abram never knew the extent of
his sister's information regarding the nefarious
transactions of the Oxminster election.

Next day he paid the forfeit in lieu of the
six months' notice to Mr. Eaymont. It was
received without one remonstrating word,
without one expression of regret. Whispers
soon to become compromising facts, had
reached the senior partner's ears, and Mr.
Rout's timely resignation fortified the position
of the firm, soon to be on its defence for wilful
and corrupt misdirection of its client's, Lord
Le Pole's, election contest. Simultaneously,
and at his own instance, Abram Eout's name
was removed from the roll of attorneys-at-law.
A few days later Messrs. Mitchell & Co.,
Tiger Court, Swift Street, London, advertised
for sale two valuable literary properties, one
a weekly organ of uncompromising liberal
principles, the other of moderate conservative
tenets. The first was the Oxminster
Weekly Sin, the second a bi-weekly county
paper representing the agricultural shire of

S . The properties were eminently

marketable and soon found purchasers, and
it may be mentioned here, though in
advance of our story, that on receiving from
Messrs. Critcheil & Co. the very handsome

cheque that represented the purchase-money
of the Oxminster Weekly Sun, Mr. Eout experienced
a strange and involuntary mental conflict,
which called to life the antagonism of that
hour with his sister, which had resulted in
reparation and renunciation. His legal mind
was used to weigh both sides of a knotty question.
To-day it was at fault. There seemed
plenty of argument for the one issue, nothing
but the iteration of a fact for the other. For
the one. Sir Janitor was as cute as he, Abram
Eout, was. The thousand pounds over and
above the value of the Weekly Sun represented
value on another count  that of
immediate influence over the Oxminster
electors. "Immediate," yes, that was the
count that had nothing to do with the actual
value of the paper itself. And Sir Janitor had
got the worth of his money. On the other,
what did that thousand pounds represent ?
His honour. That was the one fact no armament
could sophisticate away. Did Elsie
know? He thought not. The transaction
had been between man and man, and it was
not likely Sir Janitor would betray himself.

But a " scrutiny " such as was imminent in
the Oxminster case was sure to be crucial,
and there was no telling? how things miofht
turn ; and if it did leak out, how proudly he
could point to reparation if he repaid that thousand
??(? it'. Was he Quixotic ? Elsie was, just a
little. Again, how could he do it ? Sir Janitor
would not understand his real motive  he would
be suspicious of a trap, or think he was mad. He
had got the worth of his money, every penny
of it ; but for him, Abram Eout. Eawsoii
would not have won, or at least with a very
narrow majority. Sir Janitor had not been
defrauded, many an election had cost thousands
more, and there had been no picking-holes.
And after all what was a thousand
pounds to the millionaire knight?  he would
have made it two thousand if it had been
demanded.

There had been little money on Le Pole's
part, and his hands had been tied. He had
been put also to much personal expense not
entered in the bills. This thousand pounds
represented  loudly rose the inner voice (it
had Elsie's tone, it seemed to him)  it represented

his honour 1 He would make reparation,
would refund the same namelessly ; that
would do, and then he could meet Elsie's clear
searching eyes without quailing. His honour !
Abram Eout's chest swelled, he threw back
his shoulders. Virtue was a delightful sensation
; he would turn over a new leaf now,
with his good angel, his beautiful well-beloved
sister, at his side.

Then the eyes of his soul, waking from
their dimness, glanced back at the leaves he
had turned down in the record of his life, and
with an absolute shudder the man recognized
the bitter truth, that though money could stain
honour, it could never make it clear again.
Still at its behest Abram Eout paid back ia
Bank of England notes, without word or sign
to indicate the quarter from which they came,
the thousand pounds that had risen in judgment
against him. When he had done that
he shut down the window of his soul, and he
said to himself, as if afraid of himself, " I
shall not have a penny left."

No earthly clinging,

No lingering gaze,
No strife at parting.

No new amaze,
But sweetly, gently,

lie passed away
From the world's dim twilight

To endless day."

Mu. EouT had not been long in his office the
morning following his conversation with his
sister (he had come to town later than usual),
when he was summoned to the senior partner's
room. There he found an elderly lady, a
stranger ; it was Mabella

Mrs. Tyler has come about that bill, Mr.
Eout," said Mr. Eaymont. " I thought it had
been arranged. You had the conduct of the
matter."

Mr. Eout explained. Mabella listened, nota
little puzzled at first. Gradually she began
to see light, and as it came clearer she
showed an increasing agitation.

Mr. Eout," she said at last, " would sou
kindly tell me the whole story without
reserve ? You seem to know a good deal
about Major Tyler. In that you have the
advantage of his wife."

And with certain reserves Mr. Eout did so.
He took up his tale from the point of the bill's
history, and in substance told the major's wife
the whole transaction as narrated by that gentleman's
sister on the night of their mother's
death.

Mabella was a woman of determined will
and strength of mind, or she had not sat so
calmly through what was to her simply a
series of shocks.

Then she said, when Mr. Eout had ceased:
Miss Eber never held the bill, nor her
brother either ? "

Never."

"How did she come to know of
it?"

He told her. Then came the question he
had dreaded.

\Yhat was the connection between Major
Tyler and Miss Eber?"

A foolish engagement when Miss Eber
was only a little over eighteen."

One more question, sir. Did he marry
the woman, his colonel's wife, with whom he
ran away ? "

"Madam," said Mr. Eout, restraining himself
with an effort, *' she was not his colonel's
wife ; she was the young wife of one of the
junior officers, and he did not run away with
her. The intrigue was discovered. She was
not eighteen, I believe, and her husband
turned her out of doors. Major Tyler refused
to open his, it would compromise him, he said ;
but he offered to find her a protector. She
tried to commit suicide  threw herself into
a river, It she was saved. Her husband
divorced her, and the officers of the regiment
forced Major Tyler to marry her. He had to
exchange ; they went to India, where she
died. That is the story."

"Was it after this  this occurrence  or
before that he met with Miss Eber ? " Mabella
asked.

"After."

Was his wife alive ? "

She was."

Thank you, sir. ' She took from her
purse the cheque her father had sent for the
two thousand pounds and handed it to Mr.
Eaymont.

' You will arrange the matter, if you please''
she said, ' and let me know what I am in
your debt."

Are you quite determined to retrieve this
bill, madam ? " asked Mr. Eout in a tone of
remonstrance.

"Pardon me, Mrs. Tyler," said Mr. Payment,
interposing before she could reply,
but have you any means independent of
your father ? "

I had ; I have none now."

"Do you mean they are all spent and gone
since your marriage? "

' All, and since my marriage."

Then the law gives your husband no claim
on your father. You had better let it take
its course in this case."

Sir," she said, speaking with mingled
shame and pain, " the name of Egbert is
worth two thousand pounds. It would kill
VOL. in. 40

my father to see it connected Avitli such a
transaction. We have never before had
dealings but with honourable gentlemen."

There was nothing more to be said, and
Mabella, keeping up her dignity to the last,
departed.

When she was alone in her room at her
hotel  she was not to return to Nettlethorp
till the morning  she sat down to take
counsel with herself.

The time for tears and regrets had passed
with Mabella. After nearly an hour's silent
communion, an hour that added lines to her
mouth and furrows to her brow, she rose
briskly and ordered a brougham to be in readiness
in half-an-hour. She had shopping to do.
On the morrow she would return to the Hall
and bide her time. She would wear a mask,
but that would be easy now ; it was only the
heart that made the face a tell-tale, and hers
was dead  dead at least to the ironmonger's
son.

Dulsie did not get better. What the Sandy-cot
doctor thought to be a chill was more,
it was a sudden failure of the heart's action.

She made the short journey to Egbert Hall
sith difficulty, but the weather being warm
and genial she rallied among her flowers, and
Judy took heart of grace and spoke words of
cheer to the squire. The rally was only fora
few days. She was found one bright morning
sitting in the easy garden-chair which
Par ton had placed for her at the head of her
conservatory, a gorgeous cactus-bloom in her
hand, clematis and Cape jasmine drooping by
her head. IlerHps were parted as if in act of
speech, but her eyes were closed  closed on
the fragile splendours she deemed so fair, ta
open with a glad surprise on

The master-tints of heaven."

All these things were against the squire.
His strength was no longer that of hale old.
aL'e; he was sensibly feebler, and his spirit
within him was quenched. Xot even Judy
could win a smile from him. But it was on
her slight young arm he leant at the solemn
service for the dead, held in the dim religious
light of the old chapel. He was not with the
dear dead daughter. Back to his fancy had

40- 2

come that other face which thirty years ago
had lain so sweetly still in the shrouding
linen beneath the half-closed lid of the oak
coffin.

Only a few years," he had whispered
then; "only a few days," he whispered now.

And when the sad train of mourners issued
from the arched doorway, the " rolling organ
harmony " swelling up and blending with the
voices of little children in the Resurrection
Hymn, in spirit still he was following the one
love of his faithful life to her silent niche in
the dreary vault. It was not that he did not
grieve for his child, or that his fatherly love
had waxed cold, but the foot of death had
awakened to keen life a thousand sweet and
bitter memories, crowding out the sorrows of
to-day, of one memory that told of a bond
stronger than the dearest tie of blood, signed
and sealed in heaven, and so indissoluble intime
and impervious to the cancelling of death.

He is stunned," said Sybella ; and then
she took comfort again that it was on her
and Judy's arms he had leant as the coffin was
lowered to the vault, and that he had shrunk

away from the officious offer of support tendered
by Major Tyler.

But she was considerate to her sister in this
hour of mutual bereavement, and took inward
satisfaction in noticing that Mabella
kept close to her side, utterly ignoring the
presence of her husband.

Sybella was very quiet and gentle in these
early days of sorrow. Whether their influence
would have a permanent softening effect remained
to be seen. A nature such as Tiers, if
susceptible of strong impressions, seldom becomes
pliant of will or tender in deed, and its
hours of reoTet come generally too late, and
passing away leave only an increased hardness
behind. When death has laid loved ones low
it then

Takes every failing on our part
And brands it in upon the heart
With caustic power and cruel art.
It shows our faults like fires at night.
It sweeps their failings out of sight,
It clothes their good iu heavenly light."

And keenly Sybella felt this,

Recalling with resistless force,
And tracing to their hidden source.
Deeds scarcely noticed in their course.

Opening lier weeping eyes to trace
Simple unnoticed kindnesses,
Forgotten notes of tenderness''

Knowing now

How such a vexing deed
Was but generous nature's weed,
Or some choice virtue run to seed ;
How that small fretting fretfulness
Was but love's o'er-anxiousness,
Which had not been had love been less ;
That failing at which she repined,
But the dim shade of day declined,
Which should have made her doubly kind."

And oil, keener than all

The small neglect that may have pained,
A giant stature then had gained.
When it could never be explained."

It was due to himself, the major had argued,
to be present on this family occasion. It
stamped his position in the county, so he said
to his wife. She seldom answered him now,
and never on any pretence entered on an
argument. On this occasion, however, she
replied :

"Yes, it is only right that the county should
know your position''

But after the funeral the gallant major

took his departure for London. " Business,"
lie said, and Mabella did not question its
nature. At her suggestion the allowance her
father had settled on her was paid to lier
monthly, and she had notified to the major
her intention of allowing him half its amount.
lie was forced to be content with this arrangement
for the present. For a few days ]arabella
was to remain at the Hall ; Mrs. Aylmere,
too, remained.

Soon things resumed their routine. The
blank Dulsie made was very sensibly felt.
Sybella was softer, and to Mabella in particular,
if not actually sympathizing, comforting
in a thousand little attentions. But
Jud3 seemed to fade as she moved amonof
them as of old, still with the same cheer in
her words, ]put lacking the old ring in her
sweet voice. The country air did not give
her back the roses they had accused the sea
of stealing, nor did her now quiet rides on
Gloriana restore her failing appetite. But
she never complained. She was, as ever,
ready with heart and hand to help when
wanted, for comfort in various degrees was

much wanted among the sad denizens of the
old Hall.

In vain Mrs. A3'lmere suggested that Judy
should return with her to her own home.
She was in the receipt of frequent letters
from Oxminster, and she became more urgent
on the matter as the dreary autumn da3s
lengthened into winter. But Judy could not
tear herself from the squire. Every day lie
became more dependent on her. She had
come now to spend some hours each morning
in his study writings his letters for him and
reading the Times to him. Sybella had
business proclivities, and with occasional
directions from her father she gradually
assumed the management of the estate, under
the leadership of the steward. This occupied
her time so fully that she was seldom at
liberty for social purposes until the afternoon
tea-lour.

Leal heart  lied never''

After the Christmas holidays the Oxminster
election case was to come on, and it was confidently
whispered that the result would
reverse the present positions of the late candidates.
Mrs. Ayhnere's correspondent kept
that good lady well posted up in the doings
at Janitor HalL The old knight had become,
since the petition against his nephew's election
had been set on foot, unbearably irascible.
He was breaking up, the doctor said. His
wiry frame, that had for eighty-six years
withstood both bodily disease and mental
strain, showed unmistakable signs of collapse,
under nothing more nor less than
vexation of spirit.

Worldly matters had gone well with Janitor
Tomlinson. Only once during his prosperous
life had lie known a reverse, and that was in
the result of his sister's marriage. But it had

seemed to him, with his " inborn luck," as he
called it, that the one disappointment was to
turn up trumps and to crown his days with
honour and glory. Immediately on Ned's
success he made his mal will and testament,
revoking all other wills, by which a needy
public were prospectively the gainers. By
this document Ned was to take with all his
uncle's earthly possessions his patronymic in
addition to that of Eawson. The knight made
no secret of this disposition. He took a pride
in giving the importance of accruing wealth to
the success his nephew had achieved. After
the Sandycot ball he had been cruelly urgent
on Ned to bring home his " bride," as he insisted
on calling Judy, and with a latent
hope in the future Ned forbore to tell him
of his rejection. Lord Le Pole was travelling
on the continent. Gossip had informed him
on all the circumstances of the ball, and it had
ever since been a source of regret to him that
he had not been present.

But the knight grew impatient, and Ned
dreaded the effect the confession of his rejection
would have upon him. He could not

put that confession off much longer. He was
keen-eyed enough to perceive that his uncle
valued him only as a reflecting power, that
had he failed at the election he would never
have been more to his vain-glorious relative
than a poor relation, to be awarded only the
consideration demanded by the outside world.
Sir Janitor was morbidly sensitive to social
esteem. He had beaten a " real live nob,"
and Sir Janitor, in his exultation, said,
"You shall be a real live nob yourself, my
lad. Money's the motive power of success.
I've the grease and you've the wheels, so go
ahead, my boy, and the devil take the hindmost."
Alas for Ned, was he to be that " hindmost?
" It seemed like it.

The facts of his canvass had come to his
knowledge, and with good cause he dreaded
the result of the scrutiny. Fortunately for
him the sad event at the Hall afforded him a
present excuse for not following up his suit
with the squire's heiress, Sir Janitor's alternative
title for Judy.

Gossip had first informed the knight of the
young girl's preference for his nephew, and,

like all one-sided natures, lie held to his first
impressions, and treated as " trash " the after-whispers
that reached his ear of her growing
liking for the defeated candidate for Axminster.
But it whetted his desire to see the
marriage accomplished, for though he was
certain, he said, that the girl was " all for
Ned," he thought it was possible that gossip
spoke truth in saying that " the nob was going
in for the girl." It would be a double victory,
a "real right-down, slap-up, no mistake-of-it
licking."

The pending petition to come off after
Christmas against his nephew's election he
had at first treated with vituperative scorn.
He was, however, too sharp not to feel that
he stood on shaky ground. As facts were
pressed on him by his persistent and much-enduring
law adviser, he became more and
more irascible. His fair name, his reputation,
which had cost him in hard cash some
hundred thousand pounds, was at stake. He
stoop to bribery ! He condescend to sell a
valuable freehold like that on which stood the
Spotted Dog " for a few shillings ! He cozen

over his open enemy's confidential agent, and
pay great sums to secure the services of a
traitor ! He openly break the whole code of
honour, even among thieves ! Who would
believe all this of Sir Janitor Tomlinson, the
millionaire city knight, one of the foremost
philanthropists of the day? He was not
responsible for blundering agents and an
addle-pated nephew  Xed had come dov\'n
the scale with a run. He would repudiate
the whole affair and disinherit the " irresponsible
fool ; "' then people would know how he
had been tricked. But. facts are stubborn
think's, and there was one fact Sir Janitor
Tomlinson could not thrust aside. Whence
came the money 1 There was no escape. Eout
had returned that thousand, he knew it was
hout ; and then he laughed almost fiendishly,
Conscience money from Eout I"' There was a
trap behind, he was sure of that, but he was
up to trap." They thought he was in his
dotage ; liv. his head was as clear as a
whistle yet  he'd fight them all. And then
Sir Janitor, feeling just a little strange in that
region which had the peculiar clearness of a

whistle, sank into a chair. He was by himself;
and then somehow the furniture in the
room, the pictures on the wall, and the blazing
fire in the cerate all beoan to move with a
downward inclination, and he remembered
nothing more.

An hour after Ned found him, a dazed look
on his withered face, cowering over the fire.
It was broad daylight. The knight insisted
that it was " dark as pitch," and called for his
lamp. Ned, at once recognizing the signs of
sudden illness, sent for a doctor. Fortunately
that functionary happened to be in
present high favour with Sir Janitor, who with
a powerful effort of will retained in a great
degree his senses. These told him he was ill,
and he felt glad that aid was at hand. But he
would not " give in." A little rest would set
him all risfht, and in the mornings he would see
his lawyer and make another will.

The doctor got him persuaded to retire to
bed. Alien quiet on his pillow the old man,
forgetting the presence of Mrs. Peerie, his
lady housekeeper, said in a shrill querulous
voice :

Doctor, that beggarly Eawson pauper is
plotting to get me out of the way. I'm going
to cut him off with a brass farthing in the
morning. He'll be turned out of Oxminster,
he will. He's brinoino- as his father did, dishonour
on an honourable name. Patch me up
doctor ; there's lots of life in rae still. I bed
 d if I give in ; " and his eyes closed in
slumber, induced by a powerful anodyne.

There was no chance for the old man, the
doctor said, unless he was humoured in every
whim. The least contradiction would certainly
bring on the fit of which this attack was
a warning. His mind, he considered, was off
its balance. At present Xed must keep out
of his presence, and perhaps things would
quiet down, and then he might rally. It was
doubtless the worry of this election petition
business. The doctor liked Ned, and he determined
to delay that threatened interview
between kir Janitor and his lawyer.

And it seemed to Iced as if his sun had gone
down at noonday.

Lord Le Pole, with a heart as little at ease,
had been for weary weeks on that " bootless

bene," trying to escape from himself. At
first, in the company of the fair Creamy and
her husband, he had followed with slavish
exactitude the prescribed route of society
tourists.

At Homburg they had parted, he to diverge
in his flight to solitary and, as lie found,
intolerably dull retreats  mountain clifdets,
lake hamlets, and romantic but uninteresting
valleys ; the Beaumorrises to take up then*
yacht at Marseilles and go home by the
Mediterranean. In his wanderings Le Tole
brought up at Nice, where Lord and Lady
Albany with their daughters expected him.
The night of his arrival, sitting in the verandah
of his hotel sipping iced cohen, his eye was
attracted by a familiar figure. He had seen
so many familiar figures at the various spas at
which he had stayed that he felt no surprise,
scarcely the curiosity to individualize this
one in particular. It came nearer, and it was
evident to Le Pole that it had recognized him
and sought to avoid him.

Languidly interested, he put up his eyeglass,
and with a start exclaimed " Eout ! "

But he did not stir. He lead heard through,
his father that Mr. Eout had retired from his
profession, but that he lead been subpoenaed
to appear when the petition should come on.
There had been dirty work. Enough evidence
had been collected to prove that it
would not be difficult to bring it home to the
individual chiefly implicated. In a dim way
both Lord Albany and his son connected the
reimbursement of the 1,200 with Mr. Eout,
but Mr. Eaymont, to whom the former suggested
such a probability, ironically negatived
it as an impossibility. Eout, he said, was a
Jew without even a Levitical conscience.
There was a mystery, and such it still remained.
As Mr. Eout slowly disappeared in
the direction of the gardens, a lady who
occupied a table near Le Pole's, but not
within his line of vision, rose and was about
to pass him when she suddenly stopped. Her
abrupt motion attracted Le Pole's attention ;
he turned round and with a flush of delight
jumped from his seat, crying :

Miss Eber, I am fortunate."

Elsie seemed equally pleased at the rencontre.
VOL. m. 41

They strolled away together, talking of everything
and every place but those uppermost in
their thoughts  the events at Egbert Lodre
and Sandycot. Nearly an hour they thus
sauntered, feeling a placid restful pleasure in
each other's company. The night was ablaze
with stars, the air heavy with the perfume of
flowers. From the distance  they kept apart
from the gay crowd  came the sweet strains
of the perfect band ; a faint breeze fanned
their cheeks.

They sat down beside a drooping acacia.
Then she asked with delicate interest some
questions as to his hopes with regard to the
election petition, expressing regret for Ned's
probable disappointment.

Things have gone hardly with him," she
said softly, " and for no fault of his own. He
is a true-hearted man ; a ' bonnet blue,' as the
Scotch call it."

Le Pole made no answer. He was thinking
that things had gone very hard with
himself.

"If he is unseated," he said at last with
vainly repressed bitterness, " he will easily

find an accommodating borough ; he will bea
millionaire."

Sir Janitor Tomlinson is ill," returned
Elsie. " His housekeeper, Mrs. Peerie, is an
old acquaintance of mine, a reduced lady of
equally slender education and means. She
has been with Sir Janitor some years now,
and manages him wonderfully. I am told his
temper is very uncertain  a dreadful old man
altogether."

Le Pole listened apathetically ; the subject
did not interest him, but he was pleased to
hear Elsie's soft accents, and an apathetic
mood is just the mood for desultory chat.
He even wondered who this housekeeper had
been, but his curiosity did not prompt him to
inquire.

*' I had a letter from her the other day,"
Elsie continued.

Le Pole did not observe that Elsie hesitated,
as if from some cause uncertain of her subject.

She mentioned Sir Janitor's illness. It
seems he has taken the petition terribly to
heart ; it has hurt his pride, she says, and in
the most unreasoning manner he threatens to

412

disinherit his nephew. The doctor has got
him persuaded to await the result of the case,
but he is so uncertain and capricious he may-turn
round on the doctor himself and work
his wicked will if but to spite them all."

Le Pole shrugged his shoulders.

I am sorry for the young man," he said.
"I believe he knew nothing of what was
doing, but I don't place his political morality-above
suspicion. However, he will have his
consolation," and he smiled a bitter smile.

*' How ? in what ? " asked Elsie.

Miss Aylmere," he replied.

Lord Le Pole," she said after a minute's
deliberation, "I am going to do a thing which
some might deem a breach of confidence, but
there is a time to speak and a time to keep
silence, and this is a time to speak."

He looked into her clear, earnest eyes
questioningly, unknown to himself, with a
quickened pulse.

Miss Aylmere refused Mr. Eawson."

A cold conventional phrase  sudden hope-inspiring,
life-reviving words.

Pardon mee," she added  he could not for

the moment speak  "but I guessed your
secret long ago, and dear little Judy's, too.
Hush, let me say my says She told me
nothing, but, my lord, I am a woman who
has suffered, and she had no need to tell me.
She and Mr. Eawson had been boy and girl
together ; she fancied she liked him, perhaps
called her liking love, but he, poor fellow,
loved her as he never again will love in this
world. She had made a mistake, and it was
you who taught her she had done so. Now
I come to my breach of confidence "  she
smiled as one about to confer a priceless
boon ; her lovely face was radiant, and her
eyes clear as the stars above. " I was at
Oxminster after the Sandycot ball. I saw
Mr. Eawson there, and he told me that Judy
Aylmere had rejected hmi. He had gone to
her the night before the ball confident and
exultant, and  I tell you his very words :
She said it was all a great mistake, that
she did not love me, never had loved me, did
not know that I loved her so much, and she
kissed my hand in pity.' That was all."
She ceased and turned her head aside.

After a little Le Pole, with a choking
voice, whispered :

Miss Eber, do you think she will forgive
me ? "

Yes," she replied, " but her wound is
very deep. I have had one or two letters
from her, but they were very short, no spirit
in them, so unlike Judy, I heard, too,
through Mrs. Horseman, that they are anxious
about her, and that Mrs. Aylmere wished to
take her abroad, but she would not leave her
cousins. The squire is breaking fast, that
marriage was dreadful, then poor Miss
Dulsie's death."

She knew the pain her words were giving ;
she intended it.

I shall never forgive myself," he muttered ;
the sweet little, bright darling, how could I
doubt her?"

"How, indeed?" thought Elsie, but she
made no rejoinder. She rose to go.

Stay," he said, " but one word. There
are some resolutions that are made without
weighing consequences, one such I have come
to now. I shall this night telegraph to my

agent to stay all proceedings in this election
petition. I shall desire him to withdraw it."

Elsie's breath came quick. "Can you?"
she said. " Is it not too late ? "

No. The informations have not been
sworn yet. I am in time. It is a mere
matter of paying costs."

Lord Le Pole," she whispered, " I thank
you ; Abram Rout is my half-brother."

Le Pole had considerable difficulty in reconciling
his father to the course of action upon
which he had determined.

' Some absurd Quixotic notion," he said to
his wife, to which she replied :

"Notion or conviction, Albany, you had
better give way with a good grace, for Le
Pole always means what he says."

He tells me he must leave for home tomorrow,"
said Lord Albany in an aggrieved
tone. " I do wish he was in Parliament. He
has been more erratic than ever since his
defeat. It is very mortifying."

The evening post had come in. Lord

Albany held a package of letters in his
hand.

These are for you and the girls," he said,
giving his wife some five or six, and with a
sigh reading the addresses of those he had
retained. " Business, all business," he said
fretfully ; but coming on a square envelope,
"here's one from"  he scrutinized the postmark
 " from Nettlethorp  Egbert, I
think."

He opened it. It was from Mr. Egbert, and
contained only a few lines, traced in an uncertain
hand. Miss Le Pole was ill, a sharp
attack of bronchitis. The squire had seen
her ; she had sent for him, and he thought
Lord Albany had better return home at once.
She had refused to admit Lady Margaret
Dredger, who was at the Grange, but she had
seen his cousin, Judy Aylmere, several times.
Judy had failed in persuading her to allow the
doctor to send for a trained nurse ; indeed
the doctor's attendance was a mere farce, as
she said she could doctor herself better than
any one.

"We had better o-q with Le Pole," said

Lord Albany, handing the letter to his wife.
She read it, and then said :

I have one from Margaret ; she says the
attack is a very sharp one, and that the doctor
does not think she will get over it. Little
Ormsby is ill, too. Poor Mangy, she writes
in low spirits. He is a fragile little fellow ; I
shall be glad to be at home. Miss Aylmere,
she says, has been very kind in going to see
her. The child is very fond of her ; but, she
adds, she  Miss Aylmere  is so changed, and
looks as if she were fading away. Albany, do
you not think Le Pole may have had something
to do with it ? "

With what, Louise ? "

He had not followed his wife's train of
thought intelligently.

Margaret was positive that she liked him,"
continued Lady Albany, following out her
mental argument abstractedly.

Lord Albany understood.

And so was I," be said. " Some complication
with that young Parson probably. Le
Pole wants self-assertion. I am convinced he
had the cards in his hands. I should not

wonder if Mrs. Beaumorris laughed him out
of it; the 'little rustic she used to call her."

"Albany," said his lordship's wife, "you
will never understand your son."

But Le Pole did not accompany his family
on their homeward journey. He took flight
by himself, travelling without an hour's cessation
until he reached Nettlethorp. His lady-mother
took things more leisurely, though
still making, for her, unusual haste.

So cast and mingled with his very frame,
The mind's disease its ruling passion came."

Sir Janitor Tomlinson always spoke of his
doctor, whose somewhat eccentric patronymic
was Bibbleton, as his " medical attendant."
He said Bibbleton was the only doctor who
had ever understood his constitution, and he
had some sort of idea that that functionary
possessed in himself a charm against death.
He was in constant request at Janitor Hall,
not in his official capacity, but as a kind of
pervading influence, a mental anodyne, insuring
in imparted security a present oblivion of
certain fears induced solely by the excess of
years over the limit of man's allotment, for
Sir Janitor's bill of health was still, what it
had ever been, clean. In this way Doctor
Bibbleton had obtained over the old knight 
a very fiction of a patient so far as business
went, his visits for the most part being on a

friendly basis  an influence possessed by no
other being. Now that they were on a purely
professional footing the old man was as a child
in his hands. He knew as a shadowy fact
that some day he must pay that inevitable
debt to nature, but the bill was so long overdue
perhaps he had come to hope that not
being presented it had not been noted. Butin
practical rendering he regarded death in
some measure as a disease, to be, if not finally
conquered, kept at bay for an indefinite period
by Bibbletoii's skill and his own fence. He
knew he was  Bibbleton had said so  as
sound as a rock, not even a tooth gone ; he
misht live to be a hundred, not now an uncommon
age. But of course years did tell,
and he, perhaps, might be a little more susceptible
lately to mental worry. The excitement
of the election would have tried a
younger man ; it had tried him, he acknowledged
as much to Doctor Bibbleton. His
head had at times a strange feeling of emptiness.
But he was quieting down, returning to his
normal condition, when this most unlooked-for
petition had turned up. His nephew was

an ingrate, as well as a blundering fool. That
was not the man even to keep money together.
He had made a mistake, the one mistake of a
triumphant career, but he would rectify it.
The moment Bibbleton pronounced it safe for
him to sit up he would go into the matter with
Fisk, and send Eawson's pauper about his
business. But in consideration of what the
world might demand, he would settle on him
an annuity of two hundred a year. At
present he would follow Bibbleton's instructions,
lie perfectly still, keep up his tone with
old port, and allow his mind to dwell on
nothing but what was pleasant.

So the doctor visited him constantly in the
day ; read to him the money articles of the
Times, and gleanings from the Investor, and
salient bits from the Financier. His housekeeper,
too, kept him informed on what he
called the " public feeling " about his illness,
which was the flattering gossip of the town*
and the indignant on dits on the subject of
the petition. These last were for the most
part manufactured " as necessary tonics " for
the patient's recovery.

But somehow that strange sensation of
emptiness in the head did not yet get sensible
relief, and the interview with Fisk was postponed
from day to day. Doctor Bibbleton
on more than one occasion put in a good
word for Ned, which was received with ::rini
silence, for the knight was crafty and suspicious.
He saw that Bibbleton was sorry for
the " young fool," and he thought it was just
possible that he had been bribed to patch up
matters, but he would let him see what an
adamantine will he had to deal with. Still
he would make no bodily exertion without
his doctor's sanction : it was clearly the
latter's interest to keep him alive.

There was something of the fox in Sir
Janitor's nature. A great writer has said,
*' from the oyster to the eagle, from the hog
to the tiger, all animals are in man," and that
each of them is in a man, at times several
at once ;" and that " every individual of the
human species corresponds to some one of the
animal creation." Sir Janitor's correspondence
was found in the fox ; his face, indeed,
was of the vulpine cast. Keeping, according

to his regimen, perfectly still, he asked the
doctor one morning if he thought he might
with safety write a letter. Quite off his
guard the doctor said he might, that the pleasurable
excitement of a friendly letter might
even be of service. Only disagreeable things,
he added, had to be avoided.

Then anything that gives me pleasure is
safe?" asked the knight.

In moderation, yes," was the reply.

Then," said the old man, his little keen
red eyes looking sharply out from their bushy
furze at the doctor's bland visage, " 111
trouble you for my portfolio. I want to
write to Fisk. What I have to say to him
will give me the very greatest pleasure, so
you must consider the letter your prescription."


Dr. Bibbleton was a wise man. Without a
word he brought his patient the portfolio,
placed it before him, propped him up on skilfully
arranged pillows, gave him the particular
pen he required, arranged everything
to his liking, and withdrew, saying he was
going to visit a patient at a distance and

would not be back till quite late. Sir Janitor's
heart sank. Now that his head was on the
perpendicular that strange sensation of emptiness
had returned, he felt absolutely giddy.
The doctor put in his head at the door as at
the prompting of an after-thought.

If the uneasiness in the head returns, Sir
Janitor, Mrs. Peerie will know what to do,"
and he vanished.

It was a large sumptuously furnished room,
with velvet-pile carpet, great mirrors, satin
hangings and massive furniture. A blazing
fire diffused warmth and cheerfulness, and
from the lowered top of one of the three large
windows, from which the satin-draped luxurious
bed was jealously protected, the cold
air came gently in, keeping the atmosphere of
the room fresh and invigorating. A bank of
down pillows supported the shrunken frame
of the old knight. A huge eider-down quilt
of crimson satin obscured the attenuated
limbs ; not even their line was indicated. An
invalid-table with an ingenious contrivance
held the writing paraphernalia within reach of
his hand. An electric bell communicating

with the housekeeper's room was also within
his reach. Nothing was wanting to complete
the ease and comfort of the millionaire invalid,
nothing to make his sumptuous chamber complete.
Wealth has its obligations, and the
millionaire knight, in unwittingly preparing a
guest-chamber for the King of Terrors, had
acknowledged one.

As the door closed on the doctor, Sir
Janitor's heart sank within him. He left his
pen untouched, and placed his shrivelled
hand on the electric bell, calculating within
himself how long it would take for the doctor
to get clear of the house : he would then
summon Mrs. Peerie. She would read to him,
and he would put off writing to Fisk till tomorrow.
Suddenly the sound of bells, many
bells, struck on his ear, coming in with the
fresh November air through the open window.
He listened ; it was a peal, like the peal that
had rung out the day he opened the hospital,
and the day his nephew had "licked" that
"supercilious nob Le Pole." "A peal," he
grinned spitefully, "it ought to be a muffled
peal," and then the thoughts his own fancy
VOL. m. 42

had suggested made him groan as in utter
and helpless wretchedness. Still louder and
louder on the clear air came the jubilant
clang. He would ask what it was ; but just
as he touched the bell the door opened, and
to his unspeakable relief the doctor put in his
head as if to reconnoitre.

Come in, Bibbleton, come in," he cried
with feeble eagerness. The door opened wider ;
the doctor's head disappeared, only to reappear
the next instant over the shoulder of
sed. who, fear and iov struo'olinor on his care-stricken
face, and holding a telegram aloft,
came up to his uncle's side, and, not waiting
for the impending burst, cried :

My dear uncle, don't you hear the bells ?
Lord Le Pole has withdrawn the petition, and
the town is beside itself. The hospital has
your flag flying, the school has a holiday, and
the corporation are concocting an address to
present to you," and he laughed.

The news seemed to confuse the old man.
He took it in very slowly, but he did take it
in, for he smiled and held out his hand to Xed,
who, his heart " full of a great relief," and pain,

too, and the dread the bravest feel at the
signs of the last impending change, took it
within his own and kissed it.

Ah," said the knight in a voice scarcely
above a whisper, " ah, Sir Janitor was one too
many for them. They're all alike, them nobs,
not a brass farthing among 'em ; '' he was
relapsing into his boyhood's vernacular, and
his hands were picking at the blankets.

The doctor, with a hurried gesture to Ned
to ring the electric bell, administered some
brandy.

All right, Bibbleton," he said, revived by
the alcohol, " head's full enough now, right
as a trivet. I'll give 'em a banquet ; drink
Ned's health. Sir Janitor Tomlinson, the great
philanthropist's nephew  three times three
and one more."

His voice seemed to fade away, but his
little foxy eyes were as bright as ever.

Thomas," he cried in a thin treble,

naming an old clerk dead some thirty years,

bring me the day-book ; d  n it, looked

sharp, time's money, an' them as wastes

time wastes money. Eun up the last

422

column, there's sixpence out ; d  n it, sir,
hurry, or I'll do it myself an' dock your
wage."

Fainter and fainter the voice sank, and the
hands clutched the eider-down quilt.

Thomas, what is it I alius ses ? Dunno,
don't you ? No, you never knows nothing'. I
alius says a clean ledger and a correct tot,
an' a man may die 'happy."

The breeze with a sudden gyration filled
the still chamber with the clang and clash of
the jubilant bells ; it lifted a grizzly lock lying
on the clammy brow and waved it as in
triumph. Then the doctor bent forward and
closed the lids of the little sharp eyes that,
fixed and keen, seemed as if independent of
the soul gone to its account.

Ask me no more ; thy fate and mine are sealed.
I strove against the stream and all in vain,
Let the great river take me to the main.
No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield,
Ask me no more."

Only a few withered leaves clung to the more
sheltered branches of the trees, not with
tenacity of life, but as in lingering love. The
breezes had folded their wings in lull of sleep,
but now and again a wood-pigeon with a noisy
flapping darted from its bare covert, snapped
the brittle stalks, and helplessly and lifelessly
the sere and yellow relics of a verdant prime
fell to the earth. The gray vapours of
November hung low on the slope of the
downs, the brown meadows and dun waters
blending in a melancholy harmony.

It was early in the forenoon as Judy, with
a slow, princess step came across the humid
fields to Giles' cottage. Within the small inclosure
containing the shepherd's holding, and

frinorinc the outer line to the skirting the
wood, were thick bushes of evergreen, and
here and there a slim ash enwrapt in ivy.
On the far side of the pathway was the brook,
now full with the early winter rains. The
pool beneath had overrun its brim, and the
margin was soft and slimy. To-day its
surface was alive with coots and watermen.
They did not flit away scared at Judy's
approach. One or two dived, coming up
close to the shore as if to show their unconcern.
Very listlessly Judy walked. Her
sweet mouth had a pitiful line of secret care,
and her eyes a far-away mournful look. That
look had gone to the old shepherd's heart.
There was something the matter with the
little miss." The gossip of the servants' hall,
echoed in the stable-yard, had given him an
inkling of this " something," and many a time
he descried her slight figure ascending the
path to the sheltered walks where he fed his
sheep, and old Giles unbonneted, as with
lifted face, but closed eyes, he offered a
fervent petition that He who tempered the
wind to the shorn lamb would bring light

out of the darkness that had gathered round
the " little miss," and in His own good time
make the rough paths smooth to her tender
feet.

Often, seated on a mossy stone beside her
humble friend, Judy would while away an
hour in converse on deep, spiritual things,
and often her step as she hastened homewards
had in it the spring and lightness it
had lacked on its outward course. The girl
was bearing up bravely. Her heart and hand
she brought to every duty, and never a
captious word or murmur escaped her lips.
If she was stiller, graver even to sadness, she
was as gentle as ever, as loving and as self-forgetting.
But Judy's song was hushed, and
no one now heard the merry ringing laugh
that used to be brave cheer in the old squire's
ears, and, whatever her mood, could waken a
smile on Sybella's wintry visage.

The squire felt the change, and wondered
in a hazy, dumb fashion, but somehow he did
not seem to miss her cheer so much ; his own
spirit had failed him. Evening shadows had
long since rolled into night, and night was

now to him but the dawn of day. Judy's
mood harmonized with his fading away. She
missed Mabella, he thought, and Dulsie, too,
but spring would come and Judy would
bloom again.

She seemed to-day to the old shepherd's
eyes a woodland fay, such as the folk lore
of the district told of. Her hair was coiled
under a small fur hat, from which it sent
protesting emissaries in the shape of little
golden flakes and tiny feathery curls, that
rose and fell as she quickened her step on
sighting the shepherd's cot. A close jacket
of the same fur fitted unto her slight figure,
and her gown of fine black serge was short,
showing the dainty but stout little shoes.
She carried a basket containing some delicacy
for the shepherd's ailing wife. And always
as she crowned the ascent she turned aside
to stand a pitiful moment beside the venerable
oak beneath which lay her merry little
companion, Tim. To-day she only stood on
the path, looked across at the spot for a brief
minute, and then entered the cottage gate.

Giles was within.

I am in a hurry to-day, Giles," she said.
I am going to ride to the Grange immediately
after luncheon, and I have come for
the squirrels. Peters says he will carry them
for me in a basket, but they know me, and I
think I'll take them in my pockets. I am not
going to wear my best habit, and my everyday
one has two capital pouches "  and she
smiled. " The poor little fellow, he will be
so pleased."

Giles touched his hat in token of assent to
Judy's arrangements.

Have you heard how the little chap bees,
miss ? " he asked.

Yes, I heard to-day. He is very feeble.
Lady Margaret says. He is always asking when
Judy and the squirrels are coming. I wanted
the squire to drive with me in the brougham,
but he is very low to-day. I shan't be long
away ; Gloriana will take me there and back
before dinner."

Have you heard the news, miss, from the
Manor House ? " asked Giles as he put the
squirrels into the soft-lined basket and carefully
fastened it down.

No ; is Miss Le Pole worse ? "

She's gone whoame, miss," said the old
shepherd solemnly. "It vor thick morning
at daybreak  her sun set. A lad with a
note to tha squire come across the fields
thick vay an hour and more agone, un felled
me."

The squire seemed more than usually feeble
at luncheon, Judy thought. The death of
friends was no longer the pain to him it had
once been ; death was more natural now to
his seeming, but he always felt the severance
of old ties, even though he knew that his
' little while " could now be scarcely more
than the breath of an hour.

I wrote to Lord Albany some days ago,"
he said, " but I fear he was not in time ; in
fact he could not have been."

Lady Margaret said nothing about expecting
him," observed Judy, "and her letter
was written last night. I would not go today,
cousin Egbert," she added, " only the
Cricket is watching for me and the squirrels
I promised him ; and then, you see, if
they all come home, which they are sure

to do, I could not very well go for sometime."


"Judy dear," said the squire, "I shall be
very glad to be alone this afternoon. I shall
miss m} eccentric old friend very much. The
doctor says if she had listened to what he calls
reason  taken his medicine, I suppose he
means  she would have got over the attack,
but she would treat herself. She had done so
before, and with success, she said, but then
she was younger and stronger ; however, her
time had come. The east wind  it is northwest
to-day  tries us old bodies terribly.
Sybella says Sir Janitor Tomlinson is not expected
to live."

Did you hear from mamma to-day,
S'bella ? " asked Judy.

No. I had a line from Miss Prance and
from Mabella, too ; they both mentioned Sir
Janitor's critical state. Mr. Eawson is with
him, but Miss Prance says the old man won't
let him enter his room. It was the election
petition upset him first ; but he is quite old
enough to die of old age."

o

g(

ii

Only six years more than mine, Sybella,'

said the squire gently, and then he added, " I
hope the young fellow won't suffer. Sir
Janitor is very capricious, I believe."

This was to be a momentous day in the
story of the two beings fate had so nearly
made one, so cruelly severed in thought.
Lady Margaret was expecting Judy. She saw
her coming up the avenue at a sharp trot, and
was in the hall to greet her as she entered.
Her manner was a little flurried, but Judy did
not notice it. The squirrels had begun to
protest against further durance by sundry
scratches and little squeaks, and Judy's attention
was absorbed in keeping them within
bounds in their novel conveyance until the
Cricket should have them safe. She was, however,
obliged to release them and place them
in a basket, which, in anticipation of such an
emergency, Peters had carried with him.

The little fellow knew Judy had come. He
was sitting up in his cot, clad in a warm
flannel dressing-gown of blue, with a white
Shetland kerchief, Judy's work, crossed on
his breast and tied behind.

The doctor says he will do now," whispered

Lady margaret to her companion as
she ushered her into the pretty boudoir that
had been turned into a sick nursery for the
treasured child.

Judy has brought Cricket the squirrels,"
she whispered softly as she bent over the eager
child and kissed him lovingly, he clasping his
small shadow-like arms round her neck.

Then she took the little, soft, tame creatures
out of their warm cot, and first scattering a
handful of nuts and sweet biscuit on the
counterpane of the cot she put them in the
child's lap.

With infinite delight he clapped his hands
and tried to shout " Hooray ! " but only succeeded
in uttering a thin little cry. He
was a brave little fellow, weak and wasted
though he was, and showed no fear when the
squirrels in their gambols perched on his
shoulder.

Cricket mustn't tire himself," said Lady
Margaret anxiously. She noted the child's
cheek. " Let the pretty things go to sleep in
their nest. Cricket shall have them again in
the morning."

But, pleased with his toys, Ormsby refused
to part with them. " Dey can seep with
Cricket," he said.

Reluctant to excite the little patient, Lady
Margaret let him have this way.

You must give them pretty names," said
Judy, " and then we will tell them to be good
and go to sleep and let Cricket go to sleep,
too."

The Cricket looked up at her with wondering
eyes. He smiled  he always smiled when
he looked at Judy's face  and then, as at a
happy thought, again he clapped his hands.

I will tissen the big one Leppo," he cried,
and te little one Darlin' Doody ; uncle Leppo
ses 00 is a darling," and then the hectic spot
faded out of the white cheek, the eyes drooped,
and the Cricket said he was tired.

Lady Margaret forbore to look at Judy ;
had she done so she would have seen cheeks
rivalling in paleness those of the little
prattler. She busied herself about the cot,
smoothing the pillow and cooing soft words
of endearment.

But the child was restless.

I fear the excitement lias been too much
for him," said his mother ; " he would not goto
sleep till you came, and he was awake so
early. He has so little streno-th left."

Cricket go to seep in Doody's lap," the
child said, lifting his head from the pillow.
Leppo and Darlin' Doody, too," and he seized
the squirrels, which had curled themselves
close up beside him. They sprang away.

' Xever mind," said Judy gently; "111 put
them into such a funny nest," and she took the
little creatures up and placed them in the
pockets of her habit once more.

The Cricket was charmed, and with his old
action tried to express his glee with his hands,
but they failed him. Then his little lip quivered,
and though he strove manfully against
them, the tears, from sheer weakness, trickled
down this poor wasted cheeks.

Cricket seep in Doody's lap," he cried,
and with infinite tenderness Judy lifted the
light little burden out of its warm nest,
wrapped round it a soft Angora shawl, and
sat down by the fire. The child nestled close
up to her.

Ting," lie said ; " ting de pitty song about
Allan a-Dale. Cricket can ting it, but Leppo
won't let him." Again the little lip quivered
and the tears came.

He is terribly weak," whispered Lady
Margaret ; "we humour him in everything,
poor wee man ; he has a wonderful ear for
music."

"Ting," repeated the tiny voice imperatively,
" ting Allan-a-dale."

And with not the very firmest of voices
Judy sang, choosing the two last verses of the
ballad. To the first verse the child beat time
with his small clenched hand, then his eyes
closed and the slender fingers relaxed, and
when, soft and tender, Judy's clear notes died
on the words, " And the youth it was told
by was Allan-a-dale," the Cricket had fallen
into a sweet restful slumber. He lay like a
bit of sculptured marble in the arms of his
gentle nurse, the long dark lashes of the blue
veined lids resting on his white cheeks. Teardrops
glistened in Judy's eyes as she laid the
child back in his cot with a touch so skilfully
tender it could not have crumpled the most

fragile rose-leaf. She forbore from even a
kiss, only hovered over the delicate bud a
loving' moment and then stole away.

A screen was between the cot and the door,
which, as she approached, quietly opened.
Lady Margaret had slipped out a minute
before. This door led into a larger room,
which was used by the Ladies Le Pole as a
small morning library. There they wrote
their letters, and read. Judy, in obedience
to instructions Lady Margaret had whispered,
directed her steps to this room, entering it by
the now open door. As she did so she saw
a figure holding it back. In the uncertain light
she thought it was probably Mr. Dredger, and
she passed on. Then the door softly closed,
and she turned round. With a quick action
she placed her hand on her heart, and gave a
little gasp. Xot a trace of colour was left in
the white, startled face.

She was not so strong as she was but a
few months since, and, strive though she did,
she could not command composure. She
trembled and her eyelid quivered nervously.
But she found words which, if they were
VOL. III. 43

Uttered with a falteriiiix voice, were vet dignified
and cold.

Lord Le Pole," she said, " this is a very
unexpected pleasure. I understood you were
travelling."

She had heard he was in the company of the
fascinating Creamy, but she was too proud to
mention her name, or by sign or word let him
suppose she entertained any interest in his
doings.

For a moment Lord Le Pole's courage
failed him. Then he noted how slight the
lithe round figure had become, how the
bloom and freshness had faded from the
sweet young face, and how mournful the
brilliant eyes looked out from their heavy
fringe. But he noted, too, in that lightning
moment of conscience-stricken fear, that the
slight figure was very erect and icily still.

A rush of passionate dread swept over him.

Was he to lose her at the eleventh hour ?
Was his awakening too late ? Had her pure,
true nature revolted from his as shallow and
unworthy? Her cheeks were pale, her eyes
were faded, b::t too surely he read on the

calm open brow, in the firm curve of the soft
mouth, and the very chilly clearness of her
eyes, that hers was no weak spirit to cower
within itself at its first wound in the battle of
life. The shock, the first keen pang was over,
and instead of the simple trusting girl whose
days had been as a year of summer, there was
a brave woman to suffer and to do.

Nothing but the truth, the naked truth,
without a shadow of turning, Avill save me,'
he said, " if even then it may save me."

So he told her his story. He told it her in
that chill November eve, without passionate
declamation, without feverish pleading ;
calmly, almost coldly  he feared to breakdown
 he told her all.

She listened at first with a sad, scornful
smile, and once she stopped him with an
imperious gesture. It was when he told her
of Ned snatching the flowers from her breast
and she quiescent, so it had seemed to him.

Stop," she cried, " it was a poor trophy
from the wreck of a too faithful love, a few
faded flowers. Lord Le Pole, Edward Eawson
has a true heart. I did him grievous wrong."

432

He lead been on his defence until now.
He had told her all his error, his bitterly repented
jealousy. He must plead now as he had
never pleaded before, he must plead for dear
life, and love far beyond life ; for life without
Judy would be to him only as the enforced
existence of the wretched slave at the galley.

He was travel-stained and weary. His eyes
were hot in his head.

He came up to her, he seized her hand, she
could not free it.

You did me no dishonour in the world's
eyes," she said, " you had spoken no word tome.
If I thought you liked me, it may have
been because I liked you, my lord ; you were
not bound to me."

There was a noble pride in the girl's simple
words. She did not wish to shirk the truth
that she had yielded her heart.

"Spoken no word," he cried. " Ask your
heart, Judy, did it want words to tell you I
loved you ? "

Close beside her, her hand clasped to his
breast, her head averted, he demanded an
answer.

It is Yoiir Trait to withhold forgiveness if
you will, but its not your right to refuse
me an answer to my self-justifying question.
Judy, did you not know I loved you ? "

She could not help herself. She turned her
head slowly round, looked him with frank
eyes full in the face and said :

"Yes, I knew it.'"'

Closer he impelled her to him.

And you believe I am now speaking
truth, do you not ? " he asked, as if his very
life hung on his words.

Yes," she whispered falteringly.

"Then, Judy, you need no oath or protestation
to make you believe me when I say I did
not know, that is, I was not sure that you
loved me. Many a heart I had seen fooled
away  forgive me, my darling, oh, for dear
love's sake forgive me, but I did indeed think
you had fooled my heart away."

The man did not know it, he would never
know it, Judy hardly knew it herself, but the
words, " I was not sure that you loved me "
broke down a barrier of pride that, almost
against her will, withstood his pleading. If

he did not know lie lead won her, he could
never have thought she was too lightly
won. She could forgive the wrongs he had
done her in thinking she could be guilty of
fooling a heart away," but not that she was
too hasty of love.

The exquisite purity, the singleness of
purpose of Judy's nature, allowed of no
ungenerous reserve, no self-satisfying equivocation
; to forgive meant. To Judy, to
forget.

There is not much to forgive," she whispered,
drooping her head to hide the eloquent
blood that told its own tale ; " it was all a
mistake."

The evenings shadows leno-thinned unheeded
the fire died out in the grate ; dull, dreary,
misty, the chill November day shivered to its
rest, but to Judy and Le Pole it

Was the tim of roses ;
They plucked them as they passed."

A lio-ht hand turned the handle of the door
and Lady Margaret entered. Judy returned

to outer life. As on the sands that summer
m31it she turned accusmrrly to Lo Pole, and
with keen feminine inconsistency asked why
he had not told her how late it was fretting.

I did not know it," he answered significantly.


Judy bit her lip. Lady ]margaret smiled.
With a little provoking toss of her head Judy
put lier right hand into her pocket.

Oh, the squirrels," she cried, and before
she could prevent them the little animals
made their way out, and one on each shoulder,
they sat up and washed their faces.

Judy laughed till the happy tears came.
Lady Margaret had to explain, which she did,
as Judy made the pretty creatures prisoners
and replaced them in their basket.

"They shall have a proper house in the
morning," said Lady Margaret, " and Le Pole
will put them in all right, won't you ? "

Oh, I couldn't possibly," he answered ;
much better that Miss Aylmere should stay
over the night, she understands wild animals ;
I don't. Squirrels in especial are risky, and if
I hurt them the Cricket would never forgive

me. He has ' christened ' them after us, you
know," and he looked at Judy just a little
mischievously.

How do you know ? " she asked with her
old air of petty sauciness.

I was present at the ceremony," he said
ungenerously, " and I heard the lullaby, too,
but I didn't like it," and he hummed the concluding
line of Allan-a-dale.

Fortunately for Le Pole a servant at that
moment announced " Miss Aylmere's horse,"
and only staying to drink a hasty cup of tea,
Judy prepared to take the saddle.

I was to ask," she said to Lady Margaret,
if cousin Egbert could be of any service at
the Manor House, but as Lord Le Pole has
returned no one will be needed. We are all
very sorry to hear of Miss Le Pole's death."

Yes," said Lady Margaret, " we shall miss
her in a way, poor old lady, though she did
not spend much energy in gaining affections
from any one."

No, it all went on her farm," said Le Pole.
She will be missed there. She was a generous
hostess. We expect my father tomorrow."

Then asking leave of Judy Tvitli this eyes,
wliicli was granted by a blush and a faint
little nod, Ie Pole said to this sister :

'' ]\Iaggy dear, you have been in my secret
from the first. 'Darlin' Doody ' has promised
to be the Cricket's aunt."

Lady Margaret Event up to Judy, who
looked uncertain whether to laugh or cry 
she ended in doing both  and embraced her
warmly.

At last my heart's desire," she said. " Papa
will be so pleased."

And then Le Pole said very simply, " Judy,
I did not tell you that the election petition is
withdrawn. I hope the old knight will forgive
his nephew."

It seemed to Le Pole that even his
hereditary seat would have been worth
forfeiting for such another look from Judy's
eyes.

It was a late hour for such a long ride
home, but Judy insisted on taking it, and
.unattended by any escort but Peters, who was
not a little elated by the very marked turn of
events evidenced in Judy's every movement

and beaming face, and Lord Le Pole's " ownership
air," as lie told Giles in the morning.
He was like a man aside of himself," lie said
to the delighted shepherd.

Gloriana and the brown cob sent the turf
flying along the side of the road, but it was
considerably past the Hall dinner-hour when
Judy put in a penitential appearance.

When the dessert was on the table Sybella,
excusiijo' herself on the score of some urgent
business with the steward, who had sent in
word that he wished to see her, left her father
and Judy alone.

After just a little hesitation Judy rose and
knelt by the old man's side, and without
reserve told him all lier love-story, from, as
she said, the very beginning.

Judy, my loving little child," he said
when she had finished, "you have made me a
very happy old man, not because of the old
lands, dear  that seems to me now such a very
little thing  but because you are making what
I did, a true marriage in the sight of God.
Death cannot sever that union, dear, for though
there is neither marriage nor giving in marriage



in heaven, there are no broken ties
there."

Then he laid his hands on her head in old
patriarchal fashion and blessed her.

nmi

All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,
All the aching of heart, the restless unsatisfied longing",
All the dull deep pain, and constant anguish of patience. '

The squire could not be dissuaded from
attending his old friend Miss Le Pole's
funeral, although the day set in with a bitter
east wind and indications of a snowfall.

I should not care so much," said Sybella,
if it were to be a quiet, private affair, but
the Albany are always so glad of an opportunity
to place themselves en evidence they
are sure to get up a grand ceremony. / calla
pretentious country funeral a festival, for
there is always a feast."

Oh, Sybella," exclaimed Judy, " a feast is
for rejoicing, not mourning."

For both, my dear," said the squire as if
casually, going out of the room to end the
argument, "festus, a holiday ; festus, solemn."

It was all very well in the old days,"

Sybella continued, " when there were no
trains, and people from far and near had to
come as best they could, then it was necessary
to provide food. Many a time the old 
here has been draped in black, the
floor strewed with rushes mixed with rosemary
and rue, the platters filled with funeral
bread, but that was long before a Le Pole was
even thought of. Custom has done away with
funeral feasts, and those who o-ive them ouoht
at an) rate to have the excuse of hereditary
observance. Why, Marlby Grange is only
two hundred years old."

'' And two hundred years ago," said Judy,
just a little hotly, "funeral feasts were in all
their glory. There is a very grand 
at the Grange."

ISTot ' grand,' child, gorgeous ; grand
belongs to the mediaeval times, gorgeous is an
upholsterer's term, and aptly suits the 
of the Grange."

'' Sybella," asked Judy, a little mischievously,
" how is it that the Roberts were never
ennobled ? "

You mean, I suppose, why they were not

given titles ? " Sybella spoke with scornful
assertion. " They were offered, reign after
reign, both titles and honours, but they were
always too high-minded and honest in those
venal times to accumulate wealth. They had
lands, and it took all their tact and determination
from father to son to keep those lands
together ; they never had the great means
required to keep up a patent of nobility, so
they contented themselves with the nobility
of old blood. The lands Miss Le Pole had
were lost by the squire of Cromwell's time.
He would always drink the king's health, and
Cromwell fined him in a quarter of the estate,
and gave it to a Roundhead officer, the son of
a yeoman-farmer, from whom Lord Albany's
grandmother, who was, you know. Miss Le
Pole's mother, descended. That was how she
came by the property If it ever comes back
to us "  Sybella spoke as if half to herself 
we will have nothing to do with the Le Pole
quarterings." Then she added aloud, " I hear
]wanting has the ordering of the funeral."

It was not either a gorgeous or a grand
funeral, only a very confine ilfaut and suitable

one. The deceased lady had not departed
in the odour of sanctity, nor on the breath
of popular esteem. She had not been unhonoured,
but it could not be said that she
had been honoured, and most certainly, except
in the case of her immediate employed, she was
not regretted. She had lived to herself, and
so she had died. Her impulsive acts of
charity, not a few, were remembered in some
such way as the wit and song of the gay butterflies
of society are remembered  they had
lightened a weary hour. As in nature, such
spontaneous ephemerae pass with the sun that
gives them birth. Many a generous deed, too,
had been afterwards obliterated by some
capricious act which, if it did not emanate
from actual spite and ill-nature, was certainly
the outcome of selfishness and temper. She
had, too, been more of a lavish than a
generous mistress, and conduct that has not
in it the regulating motive of justice, inspires
neither respect nor gratitude in the keenly
perceptive minds of those who serve us. Perhaps
the emotion nearest akin to regret evoked
by her death was that experienced by Squire

Egbert, and that was more of sentiment than
feeling. He knew she had liked him, had fora
wonder always remained constant to that
liking, and this loyal heart held for her a very
chivalrous friendship. He was

To her virtues very kind,
And to her faults a little blind."

And so with sincere regret, if not an absolute
feeling of a blank, the squire in a bitter
east wind bared his head as his old friend was
lowered into the Albany vault, and took his
death home. Its chill was on him as, at the
special desire of the deceased lady's lawyer, he
returned with the family to the Manor House,
to be present at the reading of her will.

It was a very business dike, matter-of-fact
document, but astounding to those interested.
It was of recent date. The whole of the testator's
personal effects, with certain exceptions,
and her money and investments were willed
to her nephew ; but her landed property, inherited
without entail from her mother, and
which comprised and particularized in the will
that " portion of the ancient estate of the
Esrberts forfeited during the time of the

CommoiiTvealtli," was devised to Judith Ayl-
mere on one condition  that within a twelvemonth
of the testator's death she married
Edward Eawson, Member of Parliament for
Oxminster, Should the legatee decline this
condition, the property was then to pass to
the said Edward Eawson, to him and his heirs
for ever. All her jewels and lace she left to
the same Judith Aylmere unconditionally.

As the squire drove home, chilled and
shivering, he said to himself with repining
submission, "Man proposes, but God disposes."
But he would have been more than.
human if he had not felt and owned to a
sense of keen disappointment. Only a few
days ago he had rejoiced in what he believed
to be the fulfilment of his long-cherished wish,
had taken a sort of self-gratulations pleasure
in the reflection that he had himself furthered
its accomplishment, and now he had the mortification
of knowing that the very means he
had relied upon to give him the desire of his
heart had shut it out from him for ever.

For a passing moment it seemed very
strange and just a little hard to bear, but not
VOL. iir. 44

for the shadow of a moment did lie wish that
Judy had chosen the man of her king, and
not the man of her love.

As he neared the old keep he looked up
through the now fast-falling snow at the proud
turret over which his banner lino' in listless

o

folds, and somehow there came back to him
with ringing clearness the words spoken thereon
that bright June morning by the young girl
Aho was fated twice to lay low his castle in
the air ; the gay pennant, he remembered?
was floating in the breeze :

I think if I played you false, it would curl
itself round the pole and never wave again."

And a great peace filled the old squire's
heart.

The next morning Peters was despatched
with an urgent summons to Mabella. In the
middle of the night the squire had been seized
with acute pain in the chest and breathlessness
congestion of the lungs, the doctor said.
From the first there was no hope. There was
no strength to combat disease, and at once the
heart's action beo-an to fail. Before the close
of the second night of his attack the good old

squire lead sunk to this rest. Just at the
closiiiix scene Isabella had to lead ]arabella out
of the room with gentle force, the aofony of
her grief and self-reproach was greater than
she could bear ; it seemed as if her mind
would give way. The strain of her most
wretched relations with her husband had
weakened her spirit for the time, and she
broke out in a perfect passion of despair.

The old servants had gathered in the death-chamber,
Giles at the door leaning on his
crook. There was not a dry eye among them.
The painful gasping had ceased ; all was stilL
The hand Judy held in hers was icy cold.
Then she bent her face down to his lips to see
if they still moved ; they parted with a smile
as of recognition. And then she felt passing
over her soft warm cheek a faint chill air. It
was cousin Egbert's last breath.

And in the narrow chancel of the venerable
chapel the last male Egbert lay in state, the
tall sentinel tapers keeping watch and ward.
The arch over the east window was filled in
with snowdrift, obscuring its exquisite tracery.
The tangled curtain of bondage that drooped

4i 2

from the transom without was heavy, too, with
soft changing snow, but the rays of the bright
winter sun streamed through the many-coloured
narrow lights and ht up the richly-decorated
piscina, the relic of an exploded
ritual, bringing into clear relief the arms of
the Egbertss, with the date 1388.

The fiYQ customary days had passed, and on
the morrow the squire was to be laid in the
niche that had so long been waiting for him
in the old vault beside the parish church.

Many a solitary hour during those sad days
of waiting Judy had passed in the still chapel,
kneeling by what had been her loving and
most-beloved friend and cousin. Sometimes
Mabella had come with her, Sybella too. It
had been a solemn time, and its softening
influence seemed to bind closer together the
two last direct descendants of the old stock.
Each day, too, Giles had come in through the
outside door, which during the day was left
open for those who would to enter, and had
stood beside his old master's bier with his
bare head bowed, thinking perhaps that his
own summons could not be very far off. He

came, though, as much to " see after," as he
said, " the little miss," as to do honour to the
kind hand that had fed him all the days of his
pilgrimage.

It seems terrible hard to bear," he said to
Judy, standing with the coffin between them,
as she laid her head down on the pall and
wept as if her heart would break. " There's
nought so unnatural like to young fowls as
death. But oh, little miss, if it could a bin
zo as you could get a look ov hyn now, it's
not vor hyn 'em tears would come, it ud be
vor herself. Ah, in nature', zoa many years
must run foot adore thee face'll shine like his.
He'd be mortal vexed if zo bees as un's let to
zee thee now."

The grave words went home to the young
girl's tender heart.

'' You see, Giles," she said, drying her eyes,
it's the last time. They take him away
tomorrow ; " and then the tears hushed forth
again. " Oh, cousin Egbert, cousin Egbert,"
she cried, " you did love and trust me so, and
I loved you far, far more than sou can ever
know now. What will the old place be without

you? It will never, never be the same again.
The cruel spring will come again with its
green leaves and merry birds, but it won't
waken you, cousin Egbert. It will be always
winter where you are. How can I ride
Gloriana and you not at my side ? And the
cob, he'll miss you, too ; he'll whinny when I
go to his stall, and look for you over my
shoulder. Everything will miss you ; there's
a sob in the air everywhere. Oh, I could lay
my head down beside yours to-night and
never, never lift it again."

But Giles took her by the hand and
led her out of the chapel up the spiral
stairs and back to the liofht and warmth
of the bright boudoir, which 3xt seemed
so desolate, where her cousins sat in silent
sorrow.

It ain't right, little miss, to feed thee's
troubles thick way; seems like as thee would
flitch anon God Almighty."

As he said this he took off his hat respectfully.


He did not think it needful to tell her that
there was no winter where cousin Egbert was.

or to set forth in preachments the correct
theology of matter and spirit ; this the first
hour of her first great sorrow, he knew, was
winter-time to Judy.

But as the old shepherd walked homewards,
leaning heavily on his staff, his heart
took comfort for the little miss, for he knew
that soon for her the winter would be past
and the rains over and gone, and that then the
flowers would appear on the earth and the
time of the singing of birds would come, for
the voice of the turtle would be heard in her
land.

And as he entered his humble cottage he
said to himself :

'' There bees times with the wisest of us
when we cannot' feel what we knows."

Mrs. Aylmere had arrived at the Hall. The
major was expected in the morning ; he had
exercised a wise discretion in not coming
sooner. The part he expected to fill at the
sad ceremony of the morrow was that of chief
mourner. That the squire's daughters would
be present never entered into his calculations.
Women of the higher classes very rarely went

to funerals in the metropolis, and Major Tyler
had had very little experience of such matters
in the provinces. So he went to town and
fitted himself out with handsome sables,
entertained some old acquaintances who had
lately seemed a little shy of him to recherches
champagne dinners at an exclusive hotel in
May fair  he had long ceased to be a member
of any military club  talked mysteriously of
the onerous duties of large landed proprietors,
spoke of improving the tumble-down old Hall,
and hinted at the probability of standing for
the county.

It was remarkable what a rehabilitating
power there seemed to be in these little entertainments.
At one great military club the
name of the segregated major was entered for
readmission to the flock, and the secretary of
a limited and extremely exclusive corporation
hoped that when Major Tyler came to town
for the season he would allow himself to be
put into nomination for membership.

Lucky fellow, that Tyler," said Colonel
Buff; " married an old woman and came in
for no end of a place ; the oldest family in

the county, he tells me. I always said Tyler
was a knowing shot."

Some queer story about him," said the
Honourable Yaldimir Pouncebody, of Her
Majesty's Own Hussars, " shy at cards, someone
said  had to leave the ' Scrap and
Scramble,' hadn't he ? "

Oh, they say it was all a mistake," put in
Captain Tout ; " luck went against him. Got
mixed up with some woman, too  hard lines
on a fellow. By Jove, what Aliquot he gave
us last night."

"Ah, ah," said the Honourable Yaldimir,
no use totting up old scores ; clean sweep
and begin again is fair play, I say. I daresay
it wasn't his fault. Cherchez la femme, you
know."

They nodded response to the honourable
gentleman and voted that bygones should be
bygones, and so Major Tyler received a preliminary
whitewashing.

Miss Le Pole's will had given complete
satisfaction to no one  there is something
at best peculiarly unsatisfactory in the
nature of wills in general  least of all

did it give satisfaction to her nephew, the
earl.

To Judy it was the cause of both deep and
keen pain. She had wished at once to resign
the bequest of the gems and lace to Lady
Albany, but Lord Le Pole would not hear of
her doing so, and she gave up the point.
Neither did the earl wish it. He had benefited
very substantially by his eccentric relative's
dispositions, and he did not grudge his
son's future wife a share of the spoil. But it
was upon the Manor House estate he had set
his heart, and that had passed almost out of
his grasp, as it were, in the most aggravating
way, for he heard from the solicitor by whom
the will had been drawn up that the condition
relating to young Eawson had been quite a
late thought, the caprice of an hour. Miss
Le Pole, he said, had been gratified at Mr.
Eawson giving her up his bedroom, and she
had heard from Mrs. Aylmere that the young
fellow was in love with Miss Aylmere, who
was very well inclined to him also, only she
had lately imbibed some high-flown political
notions and fancied Ned too extreme.

Poor Mrs. Aylmere I All her little Teak

(lodges had resulted, not only in defeat, butin
disaster.

To swallow gudgeons ere they're catched,
And count their chickens ere they're hatched."

Could he with reason murmur at his case,
Himself sole author of his own disgrace ? "

Major Tyler did not hold the chief place of
honour at the burial of the noble gentleman
into whose family he had stolen like the
dastardly coward he was, but he made one
of an outside group of mourners who were
supplied with the shrouding cloaks, the peculiar
privilege of near and regretful friendship.

Major Tyler did not know his way very
well about the old house, and little wonder ;
for, as Judy was used to say, it needed a
person to be born in it to know its ups and
downs and turns and twists. The major was
apt to lose himself in the labyrinth of communicating
corridors, stairs, and double doors.

His room, by a neat arrangement of Grant,

the old butler, was apart from that portion
devoted to the family apartments. It was a
long-disused chamber near the banqueting-hall,
where, as had been the immemorial
custom, the will was to be read immediately
on the return of the funeral party.

It was a very imposing chamber, half filled
by the great standing bedstead, of Austrian
ancestry, family tradition said. At its foot
stood the old locker which served as a
seat, but had once been a repository for the
wealth and apparel of the owner, who always
slept with his sword by his side, a needful
precaution in the days of romance. The
hangings were of tapestry, showy with scenes
of hunting and hawking. The posts had
nodding plumes of feathers set in silver rings.
There were curious old painted chairs, and
for a table a trestle and board covered with a
faded velvet cloth, on which was embroidered
the Egbert arms. On the toilet-board was a
steel mirror. Tapestry of the same design as
that of the bed hung on the walls, and from
the one deep oriel window hanging sconces
from the was held wax candles.

It was, all in all, fit lodgment for a king, at
least so thought the proud, confident major,
as he attired himself in the handsome sables
the morning of the funeral.

Very grand and sumptuous, and all that
sort of thing," he said to himself as, his toilet
completed, he gave his moustache the last

warlike twirl, "but be if it is to be my

habitation. I'd die of the family blues or get
mediaeval jaundice."

He proceeded to find his way to the chapel,
where the company were to assemble, but it
was early, so he loitered, stopping at the
banqueting-room to examine the preparations
for the momentous gathering later on. It
was a dull, dark day, the snow deep on the
ground and banked up on the windows. There
did not seem any special arrangements. He
had still twenty minutes to spare, so he
lounged round the room, throwing back his
shoulders every now and then with an air of
approving proprietorship. He counted the
portraits along one side of the wall, each seton
an oak panel. Of these there were twenty
in all, the respective owners of the place.

The last was the squire just dead. It was
with a feeling of considerable complacency
that he pictured to himself his own image
in continuation, arrayed in the uniform of his
late regiment, the 6th Dragoons  a startling
contrast, he flattered himself, to the sombre
vesture of the last generation of squires ;
"guys," he irreverently called them. Then
he drew up in the middle of the old chamber
and took a bird's-eye view of the gallant men
and noble women, ao'e and youth and middle
age, as they had come and gone. He had
heard some of the stories attached to some of
them. The young bride in her flimsy gown
of gauze, " a slight she-slip of royal blood ; "
the same face thirty years on proud and
untimely, a stiff" kirtle and high ruff instead
of the shadowy raiment. Of all periods, by
master hands and less considered limners,
some strange to the Egbert blood, others
showing the distinctive features of the race,
a goodly group, take them all in all. Fierce
men in mailed armour, brave cavaliers in
sweeping plumes, laced coats and ruffles,
dignitaries of the Church and the law, diplomatic

personages, and sportsmen in hunting
paraphernalia.

Major Tyler surveyed them all, feeling an
accession of aggrandizement, and this whole
person inflated with the noble traditions of
the race whose male sequence he had been
called upon " to take up. He should hyphen
his and the Egbert patronymic, slightly altering
the former to Tellers-Egbert, or Egbert-tellers
 yes, that sounded better. His
'' French " origin  and he smiled with cunning
satisfaction  would come in handy ; and
then he thought with equal complacency of
how well his early antecedents had been concealed,
that not even prying Mrs. Aylmere had
ferreted them out, although she had actually
lived in his native place. At the name of
Aylmere he experienced a slight reaction.
Would Judy put her threat into execution
and inform Mabella of his part in the dog's
death ? If she did he would brazen it out.
The possibility, however, was depressing in
his exalted frame of mind, stirring up disagreeable
reminiscences. Elsie, how would
she act? And then somehow he took comfort

to his prophetic soul, for was she not
magnanimous almost to idiocy? And besides,
she had now a public name and would not risk
exposure, for, however innocent, '* a story "
never improved a woman's reputation. And
if some compromising items did leak out, why,
these " old cats "  his recently-wedded wife
and her maiden sister  were as proud as
Lucifer, and would be only too thankful to
hush things up at amj price, and he knew
what his price was.

The fire crackled and flared in the vaulted
grate. He spread his hands to its reassuring
warmth, contemplating with an eye of appurtenance,
if only of partial comprehension, the
hieroglyphic heraldry of his adoptive ancestry
carved on the great panel over the oak mantelpiece.
There was a tiny space still available,
and heraldry was ingenious !

He sauntered to the dais and noticed that
chairs, high-backed oak seats, had been
placed beside the massive table, round which
centuries ago the lords of the Egbert manor
entertained their guests of high degree. Involuntarily
he counted them, eight in all.
VOL. m. 45

Then he was sensible of a strange qualm, akin
to apprehension, some such sensation as might
be experienced when, a crisis past, threatening
symptoms recur. But the major did not
attempt to trace his symptoms to their source.
He hastened away from the portentous preparations
with the faint-heartiness of an
apprehensive conscience.

No sun shone through the narrow windows,
gay with many-coloured devices. He mounted
a long trestle and looked out on the park
through a lattice pane which had been opened
for the purpose of ventilation. "The old
hereditary trees," thickly covered with the
snowy vesture and motionless in funereal
gloom, seemed mourning with something
deeper than " a vapid vegetable love " the
last male of the Egbert race. The major felt
the gloom, but not the sentiment. With the
keen comprehensive eye of an appraiser he
marked a goodly few of the venerable growths,
and rattled the loose cash in his trousers
pockets as he thought of the satisfactory
results of the woodman's axe.

Through the dull leaden air came the dismal

tolling of the bell. He looked at his watch
and made for the arched doorway, before
which was the great oak screen, richly-covered
with what was a replication of the
armorial designs over the fireplace. Just ashe
gained its cover Sybella and Judy entered
from a side door. He could catch some
words, putting them together in a disjointed
fashion. " Yes, she is calmer to-day," Sybella
said. He did not hear Judy's reply, her
head was turned from him. He strained his
ear. "Yes," answered the former to some
question, " he told her he had not disinherited
her . . . forgave her." That was all the eavesdropper
could gather. Silently he let himself
out, and with a spring in his foot and a swing
in his gait went triumphantly to the burial of
the "just and good squire," as his attributive
soul termed his testamentary father-in-law.

His sudden accession of jubilant confidence
distracted his attention from the funeral
arrangements, and it was not until the procession
was fairly under weigh that he perceived,
although he had been shrouded by an
attendant with a mourner's cloak, he had not

452

been awarded a place among the relatives of
the deceased, nor even among the intimate
friends of the family  he was seated in the
coach containing the family doctor and lawyer,
each of whom was attired in a vestment
similar to his own ; and again that unaccountable
qualm passed over his apprehensive conscience.


They laid him beside the dear dead wife
from whom his loyalty had never swerved, and
for whom his love to the very last had been
as warm as in their bridal days.

Side by side here, one in one there''
thought Judy as, holding her mother's hand,
she followed Mabella and Sybella up the
narrow pathway of the peaceful kirkland to
the door of the open vault. The principal
service had been held in the chapel of the
Hall, but the vicar read the concluding
prayers as the bearers rested the coffin before
lowering it into its last abiding-place. In
vain the major had endeavoured to assert his
position as " chief mourner "  women, in his

estimation, had no right to count in public 
but he had been met by a combined and
silent resistance, against which he was powerless,
and so, perforce, was content to take place
as an inconsiderable outsider, where he nursed
his wrath to keep it warm.

Judy looked round and marked, as a
strange circumstance, that the major stood
apart in sulks under the interlacing branches
of the two yew-trees which arched over the
unhonoured remains of the woman the story
of whose crime her cousin had told her that
bright day of June, so full to her of sweet
and sad memories. She was glad it was not
summer now. She thought she could not
have borne to see the sun shining: on the
quaint old vicarage, gay with its fragrant
yellow rose, or gleaming on the many-coloured
east window of the old church. There were
no swallows beneath its eaves now to twit her
of the summer gone  she almost thought, forever
out of her life ; no daisies or coltswort
at her feet or green grass on the quiet mounds,
levelled for the time by the deep-lying snow ;
there was no sign of life outside the solemn

figures moving with a shadow' stillness that
seemed quite apart from being.

It had been autumn-time when Dulsie died.
Then, too, the fading verdure and chilly
vapours had seemed to harmonize with the
paraphernalia of death. She was glad that
the spring-time and the summer would come
again with only living memories of the beloved
dead. It was one o'clock when, the sad
rites over, the funeral party dispersed, leaving
only those who were guests in the house to
return to the Hall with the mourners. Among
these were Lord Albany and his son.

At two o'clock Grant, with much solemnity
and dignity, heralded into the hall Mabella
and her sister, with Judy and Mrs. Aylmere,
Lord Albany and his son, a cousin of the late
Mrs. Egbert, and the major. There, standing
up at the table on the dais, Mr. Fisk, the
family lawyer, awaited their coming. Grant
seated each individual in an allotted chair,
placing Major Tyler the very last. Mr. Fisk
then, without preamble, proceeded to read
the will.

Apart from its descriptive technicalities it

was short and concise, its provisions few, and
those clear and comprehensible. The entire
estate was devised to isabella for her Hfe 
charged with a certain annuity to Sybella and
one of smaller amount to Judy  on one condition,
that she parted from her husband for
the term of her natural life. Should she
elect to abide by the man she had been led
into marrying without her father's sanction,
the property then at once was to pass to
Sybella, charged with the same annuity to
Judy, and in addition a yearly sum of two
hundred a year to arabella, to be increased to
six hundred should her husband die or she
separate from him. On the death of Mabella
and Sybella, in the event of the former accepting
the property with the conditions, Judy
was to be the sole inheritor, taking the old
name in addition to any she might by right of
ultimate marriage bear at the time. The same
provision was made should Sybella, in consequence
of Glabella's refusing her father's
conditions, become possessor of the property.
There were some minor bequests, which none
seemed to heed or hear. Every eve was

turned upon Mabella and lier husband. She
did not keep suspense long on the tension.

With calm, simple dignity, blended with a
sorrowful humility, she rose from her place
at the head of the table and said :

"I acknowledge the justice of my beloved
father's will, and I accept the property with
ail its conditions."

That was all she said.

Judy was pale as death. Le Pole, whose
seat was next to hers, took her hand as if to
impart courage.

Sybella then rose and with equal dignity said :

I rejoice at my sister's decision. The
inheritance would have been very bitter tome
had she determined otherwise. We can
still point without a blush to our motto, sans
cachet Then she sat down.

And all this time, but a few minutes by
the dial, Geoffrey Tyler sat immovable, his
tongue for the moment paralyzed and his lips
dry and parched. Now and again, as he
attempted to utter speech, they parted with
an audible sound as of fever agony.

The business was over. All rose to depart.

Then the tension gave way and he sprang to
his feet. He clenched his hand and brought
it down on the table with a blow that echoed
through the hall. Mabella stood calmly
defiant, with just the faintest trace of a smile
on her lips. As a precautionary measure
Mrs. Aylmere slipped unobserved from the
room, and summoned Grant and a footman
in readiness for an emergency.

The blow unloosed his tongue. It heralded
its freedom with a blasphemous oath, the like
of which, even in the lawless days of old, had
surely never resounded within those venerated
walls. It seemed to relieve him, for though
his voice shook with suppressed rage he
spoke quietly and without bluster. He said,
looking full at his wife, who neither flinched
nor turned pale :

The law shall decide between us, and if
this "  another oath  "instrument holds good,
I shall claim you, even without the only thing
that ever made me touch the border of your
garment'' he made a gesture of loathing.
No doting clodhopper can touch a husband's
rights, and senile and uxorious

spinsters, if they will jump into the matrimonial
trap, will find it sure and fast.
Listen to me, madam, while I tell you the
effect of the dainty noose sou were always
trying on your portly neck ; it makes you my
bond-slave, my wageless servant, my die
damme, my goods and chattels, my household
commodity, anything and everything that constitutes
a thing to possess  absolutely possess,
mind you, for in such a bond there is no
quittance."

He ceased. Judy trembled and even Sybella
winced. Mabella only smiled, and at a sign
from her Mr. Fisk produced a document, not
very important-looking or lengthy. He opened
it. " Major Tyler," he said, " you have overshot
your mark. If after you have refreshed
your memory by glancing your eye over this
true copy, properly attested, of original deeds
in safe keeping, you should still wish to
enforce your matrimonial rights, you will
have the goodness to instruct your solicitor.
I will act for my late client's daughter, in
whose name I utterly repudiate you and
your claims."

He handed the document in question to the
major. Obeying the fascination of fear, the
latter took it. The same instant it fell from
his hands, and just casting a glance to see if
the way out was clear, he made a step
towards Mabella, lifting his hand in a
menacing gesture. In nautical phrase the
major had been taken in very bad weather.
He had been heavily struck on his weather
bow, and now, and with fatal effect, amidships,
and was breaking up.

Quick as lightning Le Pole intervened, so
suddenly the major was taken aback and
thrown against the table.

Mabella did not stir an inch, or even change
countenance. Then at a sign from Mrs.
Aylmere, who had hastened back to the
scene, her reserve force, Grant and the
footman, hurried from behind the screen
and placed themselves beside their mistress.


Show Major Tyler out," said Mabella with
quiet dignity.

"This way, sir," and Grant respectfully
but significantly pointed to the door.

But the major, like a spent fox, showed
feeble front, be stood still and glared.

Remove him," cried Mabella.

Which with heart and hand Grant and his
auxiliary did. At the door of exit he struggled
free, and uttering an oath of wild blasphemy
rushed out.

There's a carriage with your traps waiting
for you at the back door," screamed Grant
after him, making a speaking-trumpet of his
hands.

Instinct guided the wretch, and in the
servants' omnibus  a parting indignity devised
by Grant  he was slowly conveyed over
the noiseless snow, past his prospective victims
of the woodland, and out for ever from the
honoured and peaceful home on which his
baleful presence had cast the first shade of
dishonour.

It was late in the night when he reached
London. The only train he could get was a
parliamentary one, and the line was at one
part blocked by snow. He had ample leisure
to reflect on his six months' campaign and its
disastrous finish, and to consider his plans

for the future. These were simple. A nomad
life on the continent, with future possibilities
of confiding prey.

Mabella's lawyer notified him that he
was instructed to pay to Ifim the yearly sum
of two hundred pounds, so long as he remained
across the Channel. Should he set foot on
British soil the payment was to cease. And
the craven appeals which from time to time
he made to his " still beloved though harsh-judging
wife " drew from her nothing more.
In a short time, according to the provisions of
her father's will, she resumed her patronymic
of Egbert, dropping that of Tyler. " Mrs.
Mabella Egbert " she called herself.

This was acceptable to her social quorum,
to whom the name of Tyler represented only
mendacity and presumption. There were
times, however, after an ecclesiastical diatribe
on woman's whole duty, summed up in one
word, " man," or fresh from a watered-out
three-volume story of some weak soul's faithful
but unrequited devotion to a roving lord
and master, her old susceptibility, galvanized
for a moment to seeming life, Mabella would

ask herself if she had quite lived up to all the
requirements of marital duty. In this way
Nemesis gave the blankly married wife an
occasional mauvais quart cohere. But Sybella,
who instinctively knew the signs of such
tricks of conscience," as she called her
sister's admonitory qualms, was ever ready
with a telling resume of the absentee's career
and natal antecedents. This she found a
never-failing restorative. Mabella was like
a recently caught bird, which, regaining its
freedom, but uncertain of its wings, hovers fora
time over its gilded cage as if with intent to
re-enter.

No possible advantage to herself would have
compensated Sybella for what she would have
considered the indelible disgrace of Mabella
choosing to follow the fortunes of a man who,
not only vicious in himself, had sprung from
to her the ignoble class of traders ; and
that was in the eyes of the two sisters, the last
of the Egbertss, the one irremissible crime
of the many brought home to Geoffrey Tyler.

Mrs. Aylmere's curiosity was much exercised
with regard to the. mysterious document

that had so effectually routed the formidable
major, but it was not fated to be gratified ;
not for the present, at any rate. Her cousins
had not seen fit to enlighten Judy, and Judy
had not seen fit to question her cousins. But
she had a keen suspicion that in some way her
friend Elsie Eber had been the main agent of
the discomfiture of " Tim's murderer," as she
always to herself called her cousin's husband.
For a little she thought it just possible that
Elsie might be the real wife, but reflection
showed her she could not be. The man had
had too much at stake to play with loaded
dice with the certainty of discovery. He was
too surely Mabella's husband.

In a little time, however, there came a letter
from Elsie. In it she spoke with a full cognizance
of the late events at the Hal, and
then she added : " It has been agreed that it
would serve no end or purpose to make Major
Tyler's story public property, and as he seems
sensible of the mercy of silence your cousins
have determined to let the matter stand as it is,
and to five down the scandal which is sure to
be set afloat. Mrs. Tyler has chosen the alternative

she fully believes her father both wished
and expected her to choose. Major Tyler is a
known gambler, if not something more, and a
roue. That is sufficient for outsiders to know.
But, Judy dear, I feel I owe some little explanation
of the half-confidence I gave you at
Sandycot, and so, in as few words as I possibly
can, I will explain the relations Geoffrey
Tyler and I once held towards each other. I
was married to him ten years ago. We lived
together for six months. At the end of that
time he deserted me, coolly writing to say that
he had just discovered his first wife was still
alive. I did not know he had been married
before. He said he had believed her dead,
and he sent me a newspaper of a year old, in
which her death was recorded. He added that
she was ill, supposed to be dying, and that if
she did die he would repair the wrong he had
done me. I believed him, and in all my agony
and shame never doubted him. A few weeks
after that letter my brother wrote to me that
she was dead. I waited and waited, Judy, but
he did not come. He never came again, and
I never saw him again until that day at Sea-pinks.

I nearly died, too, but it was only my
love that died, died as if it had never been. I
lived. sly brother obtained proof that Captain
he was not Major then  Tyler was aware of
his wife's existence when he went through
the ceremony of marriage with me. He obtained
two letters he had written her just at
the time he married me, refusing her the remittances
she begged of him, for she was starving,
she said. It was a clear case of bigamy.
Poor woman ! she was bitterly punished ;
divorced by one husband, deserted by the other.
Well for her to die, young as she was, barely
twenty. My wrong was beyond the power of
man to remedy, and at my urgent request my
brother forbore to punish him. I shrank from
the exposure. Geoffrey Tyler was subtle
though, and he calculated well. Once safely
married to Miss Egbert, he knew that for the
sake of the family I would be silent. I would
have been silent still but for ' the sake of the
family.'

*' And so, dear Judy, Geoffrey Tyler passes
out of our lives, like an uqIy storm on a
summer's day, only remembered by the devas-vol.

nation it lias caused. For myself, my home for
the future is here, on the banks of the Arno.
I live with my brother. I do not say I shall
never more appear on the boards. Unrest
may again seize me, and my spirit may crave
for something out of still life. Then, dear,
you will read that Elsie Eber is back among
her old haunts, and wanderings again from
city to city, and perhaps to distant lands. But
for the present I am content, and even my
heart is at rest. About yourself, dear, I can
only repeat what I said to you some weeks
since  you have chosen well. I never knew
a man with a more delicate sense of honour
than Lord Le Pole, nor one with such a tender
nature. He will have no secrets from you,
and you will lean on each oilier. It does not
do when all the leaning is on one side. You
must not fret about your old friend Ned. He
is essentially a man of action, and his wealth
and Parliament will give him plenty to do.
And some day, but not yet and not soon, he
will marry ; he will not choose unworthily,
and he will be very happy, for the woman he
makes his wife will be content with the measure

lie has to mete, and only ask for her own
again, which will be something less than what
would have been yours, dear."

The night before Judy's wedding a little
packet was laid on the table. It contained a
deed of gift, legally executed, by which the
Manor House and the lands pertaining thereto
became Judy Aylmere's and her heirs forever.
It was Xed Eawson's marriage gift to
the girl he loved. There was a short letter
inside, which filled Judy's heart with a pity
almost akin to love. She showed it to no
one, just dropped it into the fire with many
regretful tears.

That night she said to her lover :

Would you have resigned your seat for
Oxminster if you had found that you had
obtained it through the bribery of your
agents ? "

Yes, most certainly," he replied.

She looked relieved and grieved in one.

"But, Judy darling," he added, divining
something of what was passing in her mind, " I
hold what most people would call eccentric
notions. Mr. Eawson is quite justified in the

eyes of the world. I withdrew the petition. He
is the duly-elected member, and a very useful
one he will be, I fancy. He will make himself
a name, and then he is a millionaire."

Judy said nothing more, but in the quiet of
her own room she sat silently thinking, and
this is what she thought :

"He knew that he got the seat by the bribery
of his own agents and the treachery of his
opponent's  and he has kept it."

She was pained and relieved in one. Pained
that her old friend Ned should not have felt
his honour " grip," and yet relieved that it
was so, for had he taken a loftier stand she
might not have experienced so strongly that
they two never could have become one, that
Ned could not see things as she saw them.

She was justified to herself.

Giles was satisfied, too, as he looked in
the little miss's " face as she drove away with
her bridegroom.

They bees two as God Almighty has made
one," he said to himself as he turned homewards
to his cottage.

And Mrs. Aylmere was satisfied also.

though in an unreasoning sort of V3.J she
regretted the millionaire. And the squire's
dream had become a reality.

Did he know that it was so, in that dreamless
land, to his full satisfaction ? Who can
tell? If he did know, what a very little thing
it must have seemed to him !
