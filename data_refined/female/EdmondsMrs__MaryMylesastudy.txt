chapter, and the first thing that appealed
to Helen was the clerical look of the
Eector's library. Her first silent determination
was, therefore, that it should be
promptly furnished with books, but furnished
without the Rector's knowledge as her
wedding present to her husband, so that on
their return from their wedding trip he might
find his shelves filled with a goodly array of
volumes. To accomplish this she went upto
London and presented herself at a well-known
ecclesiastical bookseller s, and stated
her wish to be supplied with the most suitable
works for a clergyman's library. The
first question disconcerted her 

'' What are the gentleman's views ? "

Whatever does the man mean ? " thought
Helen.

As she looked perplexed, the next question
was put more definitely 

Was the Rector high, or broad, or
low?"

Oh ! I want a good library ! " answered
Helen ; " not where a reader can only find

one thought expressed in different ways, buta
good library ; nevertheless, one especially
adapted for a clergyman."

Here was a good margin.

Was the gentleman a good classic ? "

Helen, remembering who her intended
husband's tutor had been, and his general
success, answered promptly, "Certainly!"
and the thing was done ; no translations were
to be admitted.

The young couple were on the pleasant
shores of the Riviera whilst the library of the
unconscious bridegroom was being weighted
with the ponderous tomes of the Fathers and
Doctors of the Church, all, as Helen prided
herself, being in the original Greek.

With what joyous contentment and satisfaction
did the happy wife regard her husband's
astonished look on the morning after
their return home, as he stood in the middle
of the room and gazed on his lately acquired
literary wealth with amazement. He could
only say 

Why, Helen ! "

"I think you will find them all there,"
she answered, with proud consciousness ;
Tertullian, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Origen,
and all the rest. I am sure I cannot remember

half their names, and they are all in
the originals ; and you see they are all in the
proper church binding. I hope you are
pleased ? "

'' A man would be a stolid wretch, Helen,
who was not gratified at so noble a gift ; but
but  dearest, do you demand me to read
them ? It would take me my life."

Of course you'll have to read them ! "
cried innocent Helen, putting aside his suggestion
as excess of modesty ; " every clergyman
does. But on the other side," she said,
turning him round, " you'll find the works of
all the best English divines when you want a
change from the Greek. Of course there are
no light books here. I have had them all put
into what is going to be our morning-room,
along with my own books. I have a goodly
array of them. We must not have breakfast
here, you know, Reginald, as a rule ; it
would be quite like sacrilege."

Let us breakfast here once or twice a
week, Helen, if it be only that I may enjoy
looking upon your generous gift."

Well," said Helen, somewhat reluctantly,
we'll do so for the present; but, dear Reginald,
do not call it a generous gift again; ita
love gift, and you'll be in their midst often

enough. All clergymen have to pass hours
every day in their studies and libraries."

And this morning, following the rule then
established, breakfast was laid in the library
where the good Fathers reposed in peaceful,
undisturbed rest.

A letter from dear Cousin Mary ! " cried
Helen ; " here's a treat in store for you, Reginald.
What a beautiful handwriting it is ! "

I think it is perfect," said the Rector.

And the writer perfection. Is it not so,
Reginald ? She alone does all things well"

That is true," said the Rector ; " and
never so well as when she made you mine,"
and he looked over her shoulder as his wife
broke the seal.

Shall I read it, or shall we read it
together ? "

We will read it together," answered
Reginald, and sliding his left arm round her
he held the letter with his right hand to
steady it whilst the opposite page was in his
wife's left hand, her right resting upon his
shoulder. We will also, looking over both
their shoulders, read with them.

"Dearest Helen,

The time is approaching when, in all
probability, we shall return to England as was

expected. There have been Tnany difficulties,
which at one time seemed to render that
event still to be regarded as a future one,
instead of being near ; and these have been
hindrances to mj writing to you, as I wished
to pause before doing so in order that I might
know what plans we could decide upon making.
"Herbert and myself have well considered
the matter, though doubtless you will be
surprised at its requiring any consideration
when the fact of his retirement, with full
pension and a baronetcy, was the price held
out to him before he left England ; otherwise
I do not think he had the intention of returning
at all, as it now appears that he was most
averse to bringing me here ; but the bait was
too much [for him, dear fellow. He was so
delighted at the idea of making me a Lady.
Behold, wherefore, he took up this judgeship !
But he regards all these things differently
now. To accept a baronetcy and to leave
India, retiring at the early age of thirty-five
on full salary, is unprecedented. The
baronetcy had no attractions for myself 
quite the reverse. Had it not been for the
children, and for the sake of his own health,
I should have counselled staying the full
term of twenty years ; but our two dear little

ones could not be sacrificed, and to send them
away to England  even to my darling Helen
no, it could not be; or to go with them
myself and leave Herbert there alone indelicate
health (for the climate of India does
not suit him, he is too energetic for it, and it
is wearing him out). How could I consent I
There only appeared to us one honourable
solution  to resign on account of his health
and to decline the retiring pension and also
the baronetcy ; which we have done. I perfectly
understand now the cause of the
departure from ordinary rules in the case of
Herbert. He works as no other man has
ever worked. It is killing him. He would
not have liked it to be thought that the
presence of his wife had made him less
arduous. Sharing this feeling, I have never
discouraged his energy. It would take too
long to explain to you the reasons why he is
so much estimated ; it will suffice to say that
outside his judgeship he has rendered the
Government most important services in pacifying
the native Princes, arbitrating between
them and settling their claims. He is, in
truth, a most valuable servant, but for all
that we will not clutch at the reward. I say

we,' because I have worked with him, having
been his secretary all along save when it was
necessary for me to have temporary rest.
Herbert is getting anxious also about me, so
there is no other way.

''I have entered into all these business
matters because you made some allusion in
your last letter to my returning as Lady
Lanofridge. Thank God ! it will not be so.
We shall have ample means for living a
simple country life in England, which was
always my desire. I feared lest Herbert
might be disappointed if he were not 671-
7iohled, but he has cast all that aside quite
cheerfully.

And now, having exhausted all these dry
details, I hasten to reply to a more homely
but more soul-engrossing topic. I am glad
to tell you that Grantham is a fine healthy
boy, and is not at present affected by the
climate. Herbert and myself have lately
agreed to call him by his second name 
Grantham  and not Reginald, as sometimes
it is awkward when the little ones bear the
same names as their elders; and when we
return to England we hope to see a great
deal of you both ; and cousin Reginald will
always be * Reginald ' with myself and husband.

I do not know how it will fare with
mj little girl's two legitimate names  ' Margaret
Brereton,' for she is only called ' Mary-gold
' here. Herbert loses all his careworn
looks when this child is present. He delights
in driving his fingers through her hair,
and making it stand up all round her face,
which it readily does, as it is more wavy, or
rather grizzly, than my own, which you know
always objected to lie down ; and the child's
hair is in fact literally like cried gold
threads from the very roots. I suppose I
have heard a hundred times dear Herbert's
delighted exclamation, ' What else is she buta
marigold ! ' after he has succeeded in
making it stand out like rays around her
fair little face, where the blue eyes laugh out
from the midst of the living aureole. Forgive
me, darling ; you are yourself a fond
mother, and know the garrulous weakness
appertaining to such individuals. Talking of
*Marigold,' carries me to Margaret Brereton,
her godmother by proxy. I had a letter
from the dear girl only yesterday, in which
there were also a few lines to Herbert from
the father. She is carrying on the work of
the Marigold Guild bravely, and helps her
father in every way, studying always with

him. How glad I am for her father s sake !
a holy man, Helen, and a true. I long
for you and Reginald to know him.

I cannot write any more, as being still
secretary, I have much work on my hands.
Kindest regards from both to dear cousin
Reginald, and much love to yourself, from
your cousin

May.

Just a few words to say that I know
nothing about the exquisite water-colour
drawing you speak of as found in Dr. Grantham's
portfolio, labelled in the doctor's handwriting
as ' Nausikaa,' which Mr. Ashcroft
has secured, thinking that it must be a portrait
of myself when a girl. I was certainly
at no time drawn in the character of Nau-
sikaa, nor playing with a ball, although I
was very fond of that simple sport in my
girlish days. Dear Dr. Grantham, I remember,
had an especial admiration for that
young Homeric princess, so much so, that
in his last moments, when his mind was
wandering, and speech had almost failed, I
heard him in broken accents murmur ' Nau-
sikaa.'"
