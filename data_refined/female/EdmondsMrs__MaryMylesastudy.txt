An angel trust that murmurs " Come what may,

No fond regret shall tempt my feet to stray

From the strict path of mortified desires."

Though hearts are weak, lips need not so be liars.

Had there been any choice, I do not say

I should have chosen this dull rugged way.

This way of stones and faints, and wayside briars.

What then ? I grieve not, faint not. God is kind.

He gives me strange sweet flowers that push between

The flints,  such as no garden ever bore :

And gathering these, how can I choose but mind

What thankful hearts have gleaned where now I glean,

What patient feet have passed this way before?

All things have grief at times. When high winds shake it,
The grove is grieved with plaintive murmuring ;

So grieves the woodland bird when fowlers take it,
To feel the net encompassing its wings ;

And so the heart when peace and joy forsake it

At Love's ravishment.

E. C. Leirot.

One more look at the garden where she had
passed so many happy moments, each leading
up step by step to that supreme
moment of all, when the young man's hands
had imprisoned hers that held the marigold
in his strong and passionate grasp, and when
her own love stood confessed before him.
With true delicacy Mrs. Hazelhurst and
Helen had forborne to intrude their attentions
upon her this morning, and had left her

VOL. II. B

for a few hours communing by herself.
They had naturally considered that a fresh
accession of grief would naturally be aroused
on this, the last morning.

That short-lived love affair, so recently
torn up by the very roots, must needs
leave some poignant memories in the heart
whence it has been so ruthlessly plucked,"
soliloquized Mrs. Hazelhurst, with some touch
of sympathetic sentiment in her heart ; " it
must take a little time to get over it
altogether, although it was so absurd in
both of them. They'll find out before very
long that it was really an absurd business ;
and then their wounds will beat fast enough,
as I do not think that there are any two
persons in the world who would more dislike
the imputation of silliness than Miss Miles
and my nephew." So thought Mrs. Hazel-hurst
as sbe ordered the carriage to be in
waiting, and without any comment quietly
bade Helen prepare to accompany her. " It
is the only courtesy that I can show her ;
silence and not words will better suit her
present mood," and Mrs. Hazelhurst sighed
involuntarily, almost dreading the approaching
farewell.

But Mars had overcome. Although the
night had been stormy the morn arose in
sunshine. Love and peace had sung their
benediction in her bosom with the returning
light of this new day, for the onward path
lay clear and well-defined before her mental
vision.

One more look at the garden. The wicket
gate was unfastened; she pushed it gently
and went in. No one apparently had entered
it, or trodden upon that walk since she had
paused there awhile to strip off some superfluous
leaves from her handful of mary golds
before she offered them to her lover, and
there they lay where they had fallen 
scorched, dried up, and withered. She
stepped over them and passed on. The
hewn down trunk was lying in the same
position in which it had been felled, falling
with a crash as the sound of the gong met
her ears. Splinters and chips were scattered
all around. " Only four days ago," she said,
softly, and her thoughts leapt with a bound
to that half-dreamt-of heaven of free life
and liberty, unshackled by conventionalities,
in a far-off land. She recalled it, and the
manly form of the young woodsman with his

uplifted axe and glowing face, but no trace
of weakness was visible in her retrospective
glance. She had gone through a fiery ordeal,
and had come out purged of all dross. The
future lay before, mapped out in clear decisive
lines, and in that outlook there was no stain
of self-seeking. She almost felt something
akin to gladness that she had been strong
enough to release her young lover, that she
had of her own free will given the son back
to his mother; she, who had held him in bonds
stronger than life, had with her own hands,
with her own lips, loosed him. For one
moment, as she measured the wide gap
yawning between that past dream of love and
the dim future, her lips quivered, but only
for a moment. She walked slowly towards
the arbour. She would sit for a few moments
on the log seat, and let her eyes drink in the
whole scene, and then farewell for ever to the
chestnuts with its hamadryad myth, to her
garden and dreams of love ; and welcome
again the scholastic life, the scholastic calm .
She put back the trailing boughs, but the
seat was occupied by Joe  Joe, fresh from
his native element, the muck heap.
 Joe ! ''

"I humbly ask pardon, Miss Miles," cried
Joe, springing up so suddenly that he almost
performed a somersault in his endeavour to
preserve his equilibrium. " T hadn't thowt
you'd be a-coming here, miss ; but I'm clean
dazed about your going away, an' it's all
throw Master Stevenson that I stan' afore
you in this plight. I ask Master Stevenson
to let me off an hour t' morning just to
make myself a bit tidy to come and give you
my booty, but a' wouldn't, and sent me off ina
liffey to the muck heap agen. ' Xhe
mushroom bed must be made up at once,'
he say, and o' course I had to go ; but I
could na' work, I could na', so I throw it all
op and come here."

Left your work, Joe ? "

I told Master Stevenson straight off
he'd better look out for some other helper
who didn't mind being alleys over head an
heels in the muck pit. I'd as lief be a
zanterpede.

[It is needful to state that Joe had been
present at a lecture on natural history, which
had been given during the previous winter
for the express purpose of enlightening the
aborigines, but the only residuum of which,

SO far as Joe was concerned, was the single
word " centipede," or, as Joe preferred to say,
zanterpede."]

You need not have been so rash, Joe. I
should not have left Sunnyside without
bidding you good-bye."

It goes kinder through me to hear you
say the word, miss ; and me an' you, so to
speak, who've been at the work together. It
wa' like holiday-time almost to come here
an' get away from that  " Joe was nearly
being committed to something very much like
an oath, but he brought himself up suddenly
with a snort. " Ista, a' didn't care nowt
when I could come here nows an' tiens an'
have a real lady to talk with  thar nowt all
real ladies that goa by the name by a long
way, but you be a real lady  more like a
erratum than ought else."

Like what, Joe ? "

"A erratum! a erratum ! cried Joe,
with emphasis. " Bide wi' me jest the
weight of a feather, miss ; but you know the
large winder at the church, jest over what
Master Ashcroft reads out o' book ? Thar
be a lady in that winder wi' a blue gown
tied round wi' a gold string, and wi' her hair

all wrinkles crackle, like a leaf o' wormwood,
an' I alleys tHowt her face looked so good
like that many a time when Master Ashcroft
be a-preaching I've kept myself awake
by looking at it. One day I made bold, and
say to Master Ashcroft, I say, ' Who be
that lady, Master Ashcroft ? ' It wa' when
I took up the flowers for Easter, and Master
Ashcroft say, ' It be one of the erratum.
Can't you see the wings, Joe ?' jow, I never
see the wings  they're folded all straight
down her back, like  an' I war alleys looking
at her face and the crinkly- frankly haar."
Joe paused. " 'Sense me, miss, but if yow'U
believe me, the very first time you come here
I say to myself, ' That lady be jest like the
erratum in the winder '  that's what I say,
miss. An' a real erratum you've been tome
all through."

Joe's unusual effort at eloquence had
brought a large amount of perspiration to his
forehead, which, now trickling down, hung
in suspended drops on his bristly red eyebrows.
As, however, this flow of words had
brought no remark from Miss Myles, who
regarded him all through with a sweet
gravity which seemed to discompose him

exceedingly, he suddenly broke out in a
voice quite at variance with what the subject
would seem to demand 

** I shall go and ask Master Ashcroft to
marry me''

** Marry you, Joe ? " said Mary, gently.
Just now you grieved me by telling me
that you had thrown up your place, and now
you talk about marrying."

There's nowt left for me to do."
"May I ask who you are thinking of
marrying now that you are out of work ? ''
A father who lives in a cottage nigh."
Have you spoken to her, Joe ? "
** Noa, but I've only to hold up my
finger, in a manner o' speaking, an' I know
the father '11 say, 'Yes, Joe ; an' gladly.'
I haven't spoke, but I've wrote ; an' if you'll
be kind enow as to gi' a look at it, as you bea
right great scholar, they tell me, I'll
thank you kindly."

Joe thereupon fumbled first in one pocket
and then in another. His pockets seemed to
be interminable, and of such capacious dimensions
that commodities of the most heterogeneous
kinds were stowed away, and apparently
lost for a time, for as he dived

down into them and brought up everything
but that for which he sought, it was evident
from his frequent change of countenance that
the forgotten contents surprised him as they
made their appearance one after another.
At last, however, he succeeded in emancipating
from a deep recess, where it had got
entangled between a wisp of whipcord and a
comb, a very crumpled and begrimed piece
of paper.

Mary smiled as she watched him unfolding
and smoothing it out with an air of pride
and satisfaction.

I am glad to see that it is not very long,
Joe, as my time is getting short," she said, as
she took the very unlovely paper from his
hands.

Noa," answered Joe, with evident satisfaction,
" it's not long, but it's to the point,
like."

And Mary read 

Moi DEAR,

i will mary yow when yow plus.

'' Joe"*

** Bennet it now to the point, miss ? "

The above is a literal transcription of an East Anglian offer
of marriage before the days of Board Schools.

But yon must not send it, Joe."

I've nowt else to do," said Joe, sulkily,
'' 'kept be a cantered."

You must not do this, Joe. I should he
grieved to hear you were going wrong, as I
shall always take an interest in your welfare ;
but go wrong you will if you do anything so
foolish as either of the two things you have
just mentioned. Go back to your work, Joe,,
and trust to time. I may some day be glad
to hear that you have risen from helper to
be under gardener, and when that is accomplished
it will be time enough to ask some
young woman in marriage. Why, you are
only twenty. In five years' time  "

Some sudden thought checked the conclusion
of her sentence; but Joe was unconscious
of any compelled reticence on her
part.

Five years ! five years ! " cried Joe.

Go back to your work," resumed Miss
Myles, in a lower and gentler tone ; " I will
speak in your behalf to Mrs. and Miss Hazel-hurst.
Miss Hazelhurst has long taken a
great interest in this garden. I know that
she will like to have it kept up as it is. I
will ask her to put it in your hands. You

know well low to do everything here. Keep
it up exactly as I should like it to be kept up.
Fancy that I am still here."

' How am I to do that ? " interrupted Joe
bluntly.

By thinking every day whilst you are at
work that I shall soon be back fco see how
you are getting on."

Joe gave a grunt of disbelief.

See, now, there's work for you at once ;
to bring up that log you see yonder, that
stump which Mr. Langridge cut down. Trim
it up and place it side by side with this one."

As she spoke she lightly touched Joe's
stubborn shoulder.

Don't you come nigh me. Miss Miles ;,
don't come nigh me. I be nowt for the
likes of you to touch."

I want your promise, Joe ; your promise
that you will go back to your work. If you
do not like it now, yet in hopes of something
better the work will seem lighter. It is
your duty, Joe ; but if that is not enough, go
back for my sake  for my sake. And now
good-bye, Joe."

She put out her hand.

I fare kinder dazed, miss," said poor Joe,,

huskily ; " I don't fare like as I used to faro.
I down t fare like my oAvn self."

'' Never mind, Joe'* said Mary, seeing his
ineffectual attempts to rub one hand clean
upon his corduroys. " Never mind. This is for
moving the stump. Good-bye," and she thrust
a sovereign into the rough, begrimed hand
that Joe was holding back as too defiling for
her touch. '' Good-bye, and God bless you''

But Joe had fallen upon his knees and had
kissed her feet.

It was about three weeks after the events
just narrated had occurred that Mrs. Hazel-hurst,
whose house was now full of visitors
who had been invited for the express purpose
of banishing, if possible, those disturbing recollections,
received the following letter from
her sister 

"My Dear Kate,

I would not write until I could
give you something reassuring, a really firm
basis whereupon you might rest content.
Although I was never myself otherwise than
confident as regards the ultimate result, yet
I would not impart to you my impressions

until they were justified by facts. First and
foremost then, Herbert has as much got over
his late folly as if such a person as Miss Myles
had never existed, which plainly shows that
she is an intriguing, artful woman, who knew
how to hold him in her toils, but whose influence
or power required the constant machinations
of visible presence, and vanished away
like a fitful dream the moment that he was
snatched from that baleful spell. When I
reflect upon what might have been the consequence
had Herbert been less straightforward
and conscientious, I tremble ; Miss
Myles is just the kind of woman who might
wreck the peace of any family. I now confess
to yourself that she even began to work
upon my own susceptibilities. The very look
of her alone carries in it something of the
force of an electrical current. I shudder as
I recall it. How you could ever have a
woman in your house possessing such subtle
attractions it puzzles me to imagine. Why,
she is exactly the type of woman which all
history shows to be a subjugating power to
mankind. Beautiful, gifted, and unprincipled
what more is wanting  except opportunities ?
And you could not see it. She was undoubtedly

playing a deep game, posing as
the prim governess with stiff white collar,
etc. ; but the topic is an irritating one which
I have no pleasure in recalling. My lady
doubtless thought that she had entrapped a
wealthy fool of a boy who could be decoyed
into a clandestine marriage. But enough of
her. Herbert is too proud to confess his
silliness, or to acknowledge his unfilial conduct
in the affair, but he is evidently heartily
ashamed of it. He is now himself again,
wholly possessed with a noble ambition, and
a desire to distinguish himself in the world's
arena, and has suddenly in almost a marvellous
way entirely thrown off the boy, and
is a man with all the feeling of a man's
responsibilities. He is changed ; his self-reliance,
formerly a quality in abeyance to
my own wishes, has come to the front, and
seeing how well it is working I do not feel as
once I might, because he no longer appeals tome
or consults me as formerly. This possibly
results from the late conflict in his mind, but
it is good. He is resolutely determined to
walk alone, but the path which he has chosen
is the one of all others which I should have
preferred for him. The Indian Bar is his

choice ; he is working terribly hard, too hard
possibly, but I do not expostulate, as it is
only the reaction consequent upon having
temporarily yielded to lower impressions. I
dare say the dear boy would be happier if he
could bring his mind to make a clean breast
of it, as they say, and thank me for my timely
intervention. Sometimes he regards me
fixedly for a few moments with so sad a look
that I feel that if I gave him any encouragement
it would bring him to a full explanation
of how it all came about ; but I think it better
not to invite such disclosures. I am quite
reconciled to his going to India, because it
will place the wide ocean between them, not
that I believe he would again succumb were
he accidentally to meet her, but it is better
to be on the safe side, and not risk a collision
with so wily a woman. I may eventually go
out to him ; who knows ? Hereafter / shall
never allude to that odious business, so in
future let it never be alluded to by yourself
either by word or letter.

Ever your affectionate and most thankful

Elinor."

**No, EHnor," said Mrs. Hazelhurst, as
she quietly tore up this letter into minute

fragments ; ** no, I shall certainly never allude
to it again. Complimentary! I cannot distinguish
between a noble-minded woman and
an adventuress, can I not ? Miss Myles has
annoyed me very much, but nevertheless I
do know the ring of true metal when I hear
it. If only she could have liked Dr. Grantham
all would have been right ! "

Where is your kingdom ? Within my own soul, where I keep
all things in order ; my passions obey reason, and my reason obeys
God.

St. Alphonsus de Liguoei.

Dearest love, forgive
That I can think away from thee and live !

The expected arrival of a new head and
classical mistress in one, at the Girls'
Collegiate School of Chippenham, was a
subject which gave rise to much speculation
among the different grades of people inhabiting
that busy manufacturing centre and the
suburbs thereof. What she would be like,
both mentally and physically, engaged the
thoughts of all interested in that high-aiming
institution, whether parents or scholars. Of
her personality nothing was known. She

VOL. II.

had not been required to present herself
before the Committee who managed all the
funds and business matters connected with
the school. They, on the contrary, had presented
themselves before her, having made
known to her for several years that the post
was hers whenever she chose to accept it, but
that the lady then officiating would stay on
until such a decision was made, it being only
considered a question of time, the age of
Miss Myles having been hitherto an obstacle
to her immediate nomination, as no headmistress
was eligible under twenty-five, and
a few years in excess of that minimum were
even to be preferred. But this fact of age
had not been allowed to transpire outside the
ruling body, lest objections might be raised
on the score of youth to the appointment
upon which the Committee had set their
hearts. All that was definitely known was
that her name was Myles, which most of the
younger part of the community had voted
forthwith to be an ugly name, and, by a logical
conclusion, considered that the lady owning
such a name must needs be ugly also. It was
not supposed, on the contrary, that she could
be very old, from the fact of her having carried

off the honours at Girton College only a few-years
previously, and it was fresh in the
memory of all that the Committee had
announced with glee that they had secured
the winner of the classical tripos for their
mistress whenever the present lady principal
should deem it advisable, on account of delicate
health, to resign.

On Mary's side there was not much speculation
as to what her future would be at
Chippenham. There was her life mapped
out before her in a daily routine, uneven dl
and placid. At least, that was the life which
would meet the eyes of the outside world;
but she had another life within her with all
its pressing needs, and of this casket, closely
locked up from every mortal eye, she alone
held the key, and none but herself should
unlock it. Henceforth, to live as if she had
never met Herbert Langridge ? That could
hardly be, nor would she strive to attain
peace by any such cold negation and repudiation
of that sweet, but short-lived memory of
love, but she would live  though away from
him, separated by how many leagues, not of
sea and land merely'; but by other barriers
that seemed insurmountable. Yes, she would

live, and, if she could attain to it, live nobly ;
she would not beat out her heart against a
rock. Yes, she would live, as though it were
possible that he might come to claim her the
next week, and so for that coming she would
be always in readiness, with house decked
and garnished, nor gathering soil of time
allowed to harbour in any nook.

Sitting alone upon the morning after her
arrival in that neglected spot enclosed within
four walls which went by the name of a
garden, some sudden swelling of the throat
and tremor of the heart was caused by the
memory there conjured up of another garden,
which, from one scene in it, one scene alone,
was to her as the garden of Eden. With a
proud effort she exorcised those futile, regretful
reminiscences as an evil suggestion, and
as the whisper of a demon of hysteria. The
more healthy thought of present work to do,
the enticing charm that comes to some minds
in the consciousness of a power within, able
to create beauty out of ugliness, and order
from disorder, was aroused by the very
dreariness which would have plunged many
women so situated into the extremest slough
of incapable despondency. All the old loves

came back linked hand in hand  guelder
roses and musk roses, woodbine and cauliflowers,
thyme, marjoram, and lavender, birds
and bees, and a cherry tree for the starlings.
It was far enough away from the chimneys to
promise a fair return for any trouble bestowed
upon it. By the time Mary had planted tht
whole space in her mind, and seemed already
to hear it humming with insect life, and gay
with the song of birds, her eyes showed a
light in their depths which had not been
kindled there for many a day, and a colour
came and flickered upon her cheek like a
harbinger of a not far-off time when again
she would be thought of by men as too lovely
to be the head mistress of the High School
of Chippenham; which opinion would be
promptly followed by a laudable endeavour
to remove her to a sphere more worthy of her.
The space between four walls destined to
become if not a garden, yet the best semblance
of one which a pure taste could evolve from
its possibilities, had done more than philosophic
reasoning to dispel the sadness which
Mary had felt upon her arrival at Chippenham.
The rooms in the wing appropriated to her
were large and airy, but the furniture was

stiff and formal. There was nothing anywhere
either of that luxury to which she had
been accustomed at Sunnyside, nor of the
simpler elegance of her earlier home. The
thought "I must make some alteration here,"
although a decisive resolve, failed to banish
the feeling of dreariness and vacuity that
oppressed her. " After Sunnyside "  Sunny-side,
which in her waywardness she had
hardly appreciated  'what is this?" The
novelty of a town life, as it might be called,
with a possible lack of refined and intellectual
society condemning her to isolation, had
weighted her mind heavily, in the prospect.
She stepped over the threshold back into the
house with a bosom somewhat lightened, asa
bright-eyed damsel handed her a salver on
which lay two cards  '' Mr. and Mrs. Bretton."


That same night she wrote the following
letter to Dr. Grantham, at Florence 

Collegiate School, Chippenham.
Dear Dr. Grantham,

You will hardly expect to hear
from me so soon, but I feel it imperative upon

me at once to confide to you all that has
transpired since you left. It may give you
some transient pain  I hope, I trust that it
will be but transient. Nevertheless, it is due
to us both that I should at once write to you
in truth and sincerity. I wish to retain your
good opinion. I believe you to be all that is
unselfish and good, bat I dare not think
that even your kind generosity towards me
could survive if you had reason to believe
that I had been guilty of falsehood and dissimulation
towards you. You will perceive
by the above address that I have suddenly
left Sunnyside. As it is scarcely a week since
you wrote to me you will at once think that
something must have occurred to cause such
a decision. You approved of my resolution to
come here, but you expected that it would be
delayed for perhaps some months.

" I hardly know how to open my heart to
you, I tremble lest my communication may
excite feelings prejudicial to your health, but
if you do not learn it from me you will learn
it from others, and it is better that you should
know it from myself. I have reason to believe
that our friendship, our mutual esteem, has
not been snapped by anything that has passed

between us. On my side, so long as life shall
last, I shall ever revere, and  yes  love you.
I shrink not from using that word, and, therefore,
I dare not  I dare not imperil the loss
of your affectionate regard. So it is better
that I tell you all frankly. When you read
and realize how I have suffered you will be
more inclined calmly to consider what I
write, and you will believe me. I took your
kind letter, brought to me by Mr. Herbert
Langridge on the morning of your leaving
Sunny side, into my garden retreat to read. I
read and reread it with tearful eyes. Do
you remember your postscript ? That postscript,
those few simple words, merely a
short praise of Mrs. Hazelhurst's nephew,
brought a sudden light into my soul  it was
a revelation ! As I sat in my arched bower 
you know it  I was conscious of a feeling
hitherto unknown to me. I can hardly say
that the discovery gave me pleasure. I was
startled, almost annoyed, nevertheless it was
there. Dear Dr. Grantham, through that
postscript I discovered that I loved Herbert
Langridge ! I will not disguise from you
that I previously knew that the young man
had conceived an attachment for me upon our

very first interview, but I was indifferent, or
supposed myself to be so. I solemnly declare,
dear Dr. Grantham, that no thought of Mrs.
Hazelhurst's nephew influenced me on that
unhappy morning. As far as I then knew, I
was heart free ; I sometimes think so still.

Stirred as I was by this new-born consciousness,
I might yet have avoided the
catastrophe that followed had not Herbert
Langridge come that morning into my garden.
In less than one hour we were engaged lovers.

And now, alas ! I have to confess to you
what I would willingly conceal. Your own lips
had told me that my tranquillity of manner
and appearance, which you recognized as
the garment that veiled a warm, responsive
nature, had been my special attraction in
your eyes. Ah, my dear friend ! what will
you say when I tell you that a few contemptuous
words from Herbert Langridge' s
mother stripped off that garment, and that I
gave way to undignified wrath and resentment.
Never through my life had contumely in any
form come near me ; never had I any temptations
to anger. I was proud of my fancied
supremacy over the common herd in respect
to those feelings ; proud, too, of some poor

gifts, and having lived somewhat aloof from
society so-called, I was unaware that any
mother could despise me for her son  despise
me !

Through an agony of suffering from injured
pride I came to a better knowledge ;
I gave up my newly-found love ; we are
parted  perhaps for ever ; we are parted
until the sanction of the mother who has devoted
her life to her son is freely given, freely
offered. I am proud still, so far; and I am
here. Herbert and myself meet not again
until his mother solicits me to be his wife.

'' And now, dear Dr. Grantham, forgive
me if you think that you have aught to forgive.
Do not offer me pity; I do not like
pity. I shall survive this sorrow, and already
it seems that all bitterness has passed out of
it.

I pray for you daily that your health maybe
restored, and trust that you will enjoy
visiting the beautiful lands in which you
design to sojourn for some time to come.
Ever yours, gratefully,

Mary Myles."

This letter found Dr. Grantham at his

sister's prettily situated villa, about half-an-hour's
drive from the fair city of Florence.

How beautiful was the scene outspread
before him ! how glorious the golden sunlight,
the lucid atmosphere! Afar off lay
the city, whose many towers and spires were
clearly defined against the blue sky. Dr.
Grantham drew a deep breath as though he
were drinking in a new life of health and
happiness, when a letter was put into his
hands.

He had been more than human if its perusal
(when his not so long ago declared love and
its consequent rejection by the writer be taken
into account) had not caused him some agitation.
His philosophy and reason had not as
yet assumed altogether their rightful supremacy
over feeling and emotion. The two
well-known lines of the poet came vividly to
him, so that at first it was not sympathy, but
rather envy, that dominated him. The young
man whom he had commended  a boy in the
eyes of Dr. Grantham  had won the hitherto
impregnable fortress of Mary's heart. The
lovers, for very reasonable motives as viewed
from any mother's point of view, were not to
be united, as far as it appeared at present;

at least it was indefinitely deferred, and that
was of itself a deed of separation for ever in
the generality of cases when the lover was
a youth of but twenty years old ; unless,
indeed, his character was an exceptional
one.

This young man had seemed to him to have
great promise, and now, as he mused over
some circumstances of his meetings with him,
he recalled those early morning visits, and
particularly that one occasion when, having
sent for him to his bedside in order that he
might thank him personally for his attention,
he had been surprised by the stammering and
blushing eagerness with which the young man
strove to assure him that it was for Miss
Myles's sake only, she, who was naturally in
such distress, and who was so anxious, that he
came every day at early morn in order that
he might carry to her the first welcome news.
If, as it was now proved, the boy loved her
then, but was under some misconception in
respect to her feelings, how generous and
noble it was to act as her servitor when his
young heart was bleeding.

He is worthy of her love," said the doctor
to himself, " and he is rewarded ; the love of

such a woman does not fall to the lot of one
man out of a thousand once in a century."

So thought Dr. Grantham under the illusion
of a not yet thoroughly conquered
passion. Of the grief of separation at that
moment he hardly took any account. If there
were loss thereby it was far outweighed in
his estimation by the gain of there having
been mutual love ; they were happy in that
memory  although they were parted.

The question, however, was not one upon
which he felt inclined to dilate, so in a very
few words he wrote to assure Miss Myles that
he could never at any time doubt that truth,
which was so resplendent a feature in her
character, and that he highly approved of the
course she had taken in hastily leaving Sunny-side
and assuming a position in every respect
more suitable for her.

The curtain now falls. When it rises again
ten years will have passed  ten years, withall
their changing seasons of springs and
summers, autumns and winters. The scenes
will not have been shifted. Upon the actors
only in this simple drama of every-day life
will changing time have set its seal.

To look forward for ten years at certain
epochs of life seems an eternity. To the
boy or girl what does it not signify ? Seldom
do they, however, care to realize what ten
years may bring forth. Through all the
bright visions which hopeful youth may conjure
up as attendant upon the future, there
will yet creep in unbidden the shadow of a
phantom guest which seldom leaves a homestead
or family circle unvisited for ten
years.

To look back for ten years, to some ardent
ones in the full flush of strength and courage
may be a kind of triumphant record of how
they have stepped firmly from stone to stone
in the steep ascent to success, and never
once slid in all their climbing. Brave souls !
over whose paths it seems to have been
written that the besetting dangers should be
to them as naught, as though they themselves
were pre-ordained to be beacons for the fainthearted
and stumbler, bidding them to take
courage by their example, for it was not so
difficult after all.

Oh! men and women sure of foot and
keen of sight, having no tremors and misgivings,
rejoice that you miss not your pathway

between the rocks ; but be careful also
to keep your beacon lights well trimmed that
they may show a clear and steady flame to
those weaker ones who follow in your foot-tracks
!

Life ! I know not what thou art,

But know that thou and I must part,

And when, or how, or where we met,

I own to me's a secret yet.

Life ! we have been long together,

Through pleasant and through cloudy weather ;

'Tis hard to part when friends are dear,

Then steal away, give little warning,

Choose thine own time ;

Say not " Good-night," but in some brighter clime

Bid me " Good-morning."

Mrs. Baebauld.

De. Bentham lay on his death bed.

Is there anything more that I can do
for you, dear friend ? " asked the Yicar, who,
sitting by his bedside, held one of the sick
man's hands between both his palms.

Mr. Ashcroft had been for more than an
hour receiving at intervals last messages,
which he was charged to deliver to the wide

circle of college friends and literary associates
among whom the doctor had passed so large
a portion of his almost chequered life.

Is there anyone else ? " repeated the
Vicar, gently.

'' The little governess," gasped the dying
old man.

Who ? " said Mr. Ashcroft, tremulously.

'mary Myles."

What of her, dear Dr. Grantham ? "

What of her ! " There was a long pause,
some struggling emotion made breathing
difficult. '' Everything of her ! "

"You mistake me," said Mr. Ashcroft,
tenderly ; " I meant what is the message you
wish that I shall convey to her ? "

No message ! no message ! no message
to Mary Myles."

The Vicar made no reply.

'' I must see her once more before I die !
Once more ! only once more ! Telegraph to
her to come tomorrow  tomorrow. Pray
that I may be spared until tomorrow. When
I have looked once more into her face then,
Lord, Thy servant can depart in peace ! "

Still the Vicar made no answer ; but his
countenance showed the doubts and per-vol.

11. D

plenty which were struggling within him.
The name of Mary Myles had not passed
between them for ten years.

"Why do you not answer, Charles?" said
Dr, Grantham, and a faint smile struggled to
the surface. " Be not afraid, she will come."

The thought in the good Yicar's breast
was 

'' Ought she to come ? ought she to be
asked to come ?"

She will come." repeated the doctor, in a
more resolute tone. '' I have no fear that
the black sail will be hoisted, though ten
years ago I was too old to be her Tristan.
She will come to bid the old man ' Farewell '
before he goes hence."

The Yicar looked still more troubled.

How cruel it was ! " murmured the dying
man. " ' They ben black as pitch ben their
hue,' and the sails were white ! the sails were
white ! How cruel ! "

His mind is going, he is wandering,"
said Mr. Ashcroft to himself.

He had never read of the loves of Tristan
and Ysolde, nor Sir Walter Scott's clever
restoration of a sequel to the fragment of
the old romance, and he sighed in compassion

for the (to him) most perceptible aberration
in the mind of his dying friend.

The sick man raised his hand as if in
expostulation. His breath was laboured.
In broken and fainter accents he articulated,
" Send for Mary Myles to come tomorrow,"
and lay back exhausted with closed
eyes.

As you wish it, my good friend ; I will go
and telegraph at once," said the Yicar, and he
pressed the hand of his old comrade ag he
rose.

She will come," said Dr. Grrantham, as if
to himself, opening his eyes, which gleamed
with a strange light.

As the Vicar hastened to the Post Office he
thought : *' Is it possible ? Has that fancy
for Miss Myles lingered in the old man's
heart all these years ? What a pity ! What
a mistake it all was ! Well, she was one in a
thousand  that's true. How graceful she
was ! and that something in her look ! I
never could make it out ; but no one could
resist it," and at this point Mr. Ashcroft
indulged in some retrospection which might
have been interpreted by mariners that he,
too, had been under the witchcraft of the lady

whom he had Once likened so strangely to
Circe. " What a pity it all was ! " said the
Vicar, resuming the chain of the thoughts
which he had let drop whilst recalling Mary
Myles's steady grey eyes and classically poised
head. " An old man like that, and ten years
ago ! "

Mr. Ashcroft was a devout Christian priest ;
he was also a true and kind husband, but he
had never had any romance. His own love
affairs had, from beginning to end, been
smooth and unexciting. No clouds of doubt
had dimmed the horizon when he had determined
to ask for Lucy Dawson's hand. He
knew she loved him, and knew that no objections
would be raised by either family to the
union. His married life had been a fitting
sequel to his calm, unimpassioned courtship ;
a peaceful content in the plenitude of earthly
happiness, according to his standard, had
been fulfilled.

A sweet woman, certainly  a very sweet
woman ! With such talents as she has  a
remarkably sweet woman ! I always thought
so myself  always." With his mind still
alternating between the enthralling fascinations
of the lady in question and the strange

and unwonted persistency of an old man's
love, the Vicar found himself at the door of
the telegraph office, and for the first time
considered what form the message which he
had undertaken to send should take.

What am I to say ? " was the perplexing
idea uppermost, with the full belief impressed
upon his mind that the request about to
be forwarded was ill-judged and out of
place.

It will distress her beyond all measure,"
he mused; "not only will it bring back to
her mind all the old buried past, but the
very necessity of a refusal which it involves
will cause her exquisite pain ; and I  what am
I to say when I carry back to my poor friend
what, in his state, will seem so cruel ? Why,
it will kill him outright if he be in a condition
to understand it, for he was, surely,
wandering this morning ! Whatever did he
mean by ' sails black as pitch ben their
hue ?' I'll swear that was no quotation from
Homer."

It was, therefore, with a mixed feeling of
grief and annoyance that the Vicar telegraphed
to the Head Mistress of the High
School, Chippenham 

Dr. Grantham is dying. He wishes youth
join bim in his last Communion to-morrow
noon. Will you come?"

When a real or imagined duty, the accomplishment
of which is most distasteful to the
doer, is over and done, the mental atmosphere
generally clears again at once, and Mr.
Ashcroft, whilst sitting in the office awaiting
the answer to his telegram, felt considerably
relieved. His thoughts flew back, forgetful
of the present moment, to the old friend of
more than forty years, whose term of life was
hovering in a minute's balance ; perhaps
even now the fragile cord might be already
snapped.

Who can tell ? " said the Vicar, in a low
voice, as, stirred by these feelings, he rose up
and began impatiently to pace to and fro.
'' Who can tell ? To-morrow ! The sands of
life have so nearly run out that it is a question
if he be here to morrow."

This thought, with all the pain which it
involved, again brought back the reason of
his being where he was. No answer had
been returned as yet, and the time was overdue
when it might have been expected.

I must evade giving the poor fellow a

direct answer," continued Mr. Ashcroft, with
a blank look. " I cannot tell him that no
answer was returned," and then he bethought
him of the vexed question of expediency, or
truth at all times and at whatever cost,
whosoever may be slain by its declaration ;
and he got involved in a tortuous mesh about
how he could steer in equivocating so as to
avoid a direct falsehood, when the answer
was given to him 

I will come."

'' God bless me ! " cried the Yicar, startled
out of his usual propriety, " how extraordinary
! But like her," and his heart was lighter
than his feet as he trod his way back to the
bedside of his dying friend.

Dr. Grantham had a refreshing sleep, and
a bright look of gratitude greeted the Yicar.

The sails ben not black, eh, Charles ? " he
said, softly.

Without heeding the allusion to the
*' black sails," which had been such a puzzle
to him before, and seeing clearly that there
were no signs of delirium in the good doctor's
countenance, he contented himself with saying
simply 

The answer is : ' I will come.' "

*' 1 knew it," said Dr. Grantham, softly.
'* God bless her ! "

The softened golden light of noontide on
one of the last days of a fine September shed
through the open casements and unshaded
windows of Dr. Grantham's chamber a refulgent
glow that lit up the whole room with a
kind of glory, a foretaste, as it were, of the
eternal sunshine whither the soul of the good
old man was hastening.

Draw back the curtains  more light 
more light" told all those assembled  all
those who had been often present at similar
scenes  that the summons had come. Many
who have heard those words from dying lips,
when the shadows have been closing round and
the eyes have been darkened, have taken those
simple words as meaning a spiritual signification.
The demand of the sufferer for light 
more light  tells ns rather that the Angel of
Death is close at hand. Draw back the
curtains, then, oh watchers by the deathbed,
let in the golden light of day to gladden
once more the fading eyes !

On the window sill a squirrel was nibbling
nuts. He had been a constant visitor there
during the whole summer, for the kind old

doctor had taken to himself the idea that this
particular squirrel was old like himself  a
tired wayfarer in life  although his coat was
as thick as ever, and his eye as bright as
any of his brothers ; but this idea was rooted
in the doctor's mind, so a small heap of nuts
already cracked were daily provided for him ;
and one of the many consolations of the
invalid was to watch his '' happy little
friend " at his diurnal meal.

*' Good-bye," said the doctor, smiling.
' Tell Joe to see that little Brownie is never
forgotten. That's one message I forgot
yesterday. Poor little Brownie ! I don't
want him to miss me."

The room looked so bright and cheerful
with the flowers arranged by Mrs. Ashcroft,
which were none the less bright for the tears
which had fallen upon them  tears hallowed
by the tender memories of long years, of an
unbroken friendship, and now about to be
gently sundered for awhile.

There was some little anxiety visible on
the Yicar's countenance as he glanced first
at the evidently fast waning strength of
the dying man and then at his watch,
which already showed that some minutes

had elapsed since the time at which Miss
Myles was expected.

Were it not better to begin the service, "
he thought, '' lest  "

He unclasped the hand in which his friend's
was held, and was about to rise, when the
doctor whispered 

Wait ! she has come  she is here."

Pausing, and looking towards the door with
an expression of wondering curiosity, there
were a few moments of anxious suspense,
when, unannounced, and in her travelling
dress, Mary Myles softly entered the room.

** God has sent me my dismissal by an
angel'' murmured the doctor, and feebly
raised his hand as a sign that the divine office
should commence.

Only once during that most touching rite
of the Christian Church did Dr. Grantham
unclose his eyes. When the closing Benediction
was uttered a halo of peace and happiness
glorified his face with a spiritual beauty
never before visible.

Leave us alone for awhile, dear friends,"
he pleaded, looking towards Mary for the
first time.

We are near, the nurse and myself,"

whispered Mrs. Ashcroft, " if you require
us," and Dr. Grantham and Miss Myles were
left alone together after an interval of ten
years.

Did you think it a selfish thing, child, for
an old man to send for you to come to hi
dying bed ? "

Mary for answer knelt down by his bedside,
and bending her uncovered head over
the hand she held, gently touched it with her
lips.

In the very deepest depths of my hearty
through all the long years which have passed
since we last met  since we last met  the
memory of you has been a fount of secret joy
of joy  child, not of pain. Take this
thought to your heart after I am gone. I
have never ceased to love you ; I have never
prayed once that I might cease to love you ;
but I have never ceased to pray that my love
might be a hallowed one, and wheresoever I
may find myself in the heavenly mansions, it
is my trust that I shall never cease ,to love
you evermore. For that gift of love which
came to me, all unworthy as it was of you,
was a light from Heaven, bringing a clean,
warm soul to a poor dead body encrusted with

the leprosy of a cold selfishness. Without
mother, or wife, or child, who can tell how
strongly rivetted the chains of an engrossing
egoism would have become, closing all
entrance of a higher life ? Mother, wife,
child  you have embodied in yourself all
those holy affections which redeem our lower
natures."

"Dr. Grantham," said Mary, softly, '' if it
will bring you any consolation in this hour,
know that you were never forgotten by me,
but that day by day through these long years
I have blessed you by name  you who, when
suffering, bad no word of blame or bitterness,
although you were suffering through
me.

"Through you? through you?" answered,
vaguely, as a momentary unconsciousness obscured
bis mental vision. " Still beautiful,
still beautiful," he murmured, as his dimming
eyes dwelt upon her face; 'but where is he,
the 'Entrance puer,' was it not thus the
Vicar called him ? The bridegroom tarryeth
long."

The confused images of the sick man s brain
touched the chords of her heart, and tears
came into Mary's eyes.

Yes, it is long, so long, dear Dr. Gran-than,
that at times I doubt if ever  "

If ever, if ever ; yes, the time is overlong;
but no one who has once loved Mary
Myles ever forgets. Can then one whom
she has loved, still loves, forget ? No, it is
not possible."

There was a compact made with his
mother, and Herbert Langridge was bound to
fulfil it," said Mary, firmly.

"Mrs. Langridge died last year," answered
the doctor, sadly. " Death has released him,
and the bond is annulled."

And the poor mother never saw her son,"
she answered, unheeding the suggestion.
'' Our love has been guilty of that wrong."

No, Mary; love nor thinks nor works
harm. It was self-love, selfishness, that
wrought all that woe. Poor foolish, misguided
mother," and overcome by emotion
Dr. Grantham fell back.

Speak no more of this, my dear old
friend," murmured Mary, tenderly raising his
head and administering a restorative ; "let
this sorrowful theme cease."

You are right," and there was silence fora
short space. " I will sleep now. Will you

watch awhile, my daughter ? " said the dying
old man.

Smiling acquiescence with tear-dimmed
eyes, Mary smoothed the pillows and supported
his head, and the sleep that so often
precedes death, as if sent in merciful preparation
for the last trying ordeal of the soul, fell
over him. Now and then a few half-articulate
words were murmured, scraps of old-world
learning mingled with Bible texts ;
once, like as when a few chords struck on the
harp-strings recall the whole struggles of a
people, so did the words of the old Scotch
song now hovering in broken cadences on
dying lips thrill Mary's heart with memories
of the past, and the gathered tears fell on the
hand she held, as she heard though indistinctly


Way, way, by the brae,
Way by yon burn side
Where I and my love wont to gae  "

There was a rustling of leaves among the
boughs as a little living creature swung
itself on to the window sill, and broke the
fitful slumber of the invalid, as it also
aroused the attention of the watcher.

Brownie ! Brownie ! Mary, are you
there ? " cried the sufferer.

Mary pressed his hand, a change had come
over his face, and the brightness of the dawn
before the day was upon it. He pointed to
a cabinet, and fumbled at a small key hanging
by a ribbon round his neck. Mary, divining
his meaning, released it, whereupon he signed
that she should bring the cabinet to him and
unlock it. As the lid fell back she saw that
it contained some antique jewels of great
price, and upon them lay a faded bunch of
harebells !

A half cry of pain and surprise escaped her
as she recognized the form of the delicate
stalks and the withered petals. In a moment
all came back the woodland glade, and the
half revealed love as the shy youth tendered
his gift of flowers, with the words " I was
thinking of you when I gathered them," and
the little blossoms which an accident had
transferred into Dr. Grantham's keeping, were
here cherished by him all these years. She
wept silently, but checked the momentary
outburst of emotion as the old man spoke
again 

"My treasures  my best treasures  my
mother's bridal jewels, and the harebells
you once wore on your bosom. The first are

yours  to wear as a bride ; the last are milo
mine in death as in life. They shall go
with me into the grave." Seeing that he was
fast sinking, Mary was about to touch the
bell, but a pressure of his hand arrested her.
No, I will enter the valley with thee alone
by my side  with thee alone."

A bright light overspread his face.

** The bluebells  the bluebells; here, Mary,
here on my heart  bonnie, bonnie Scotland,"
and then in broken and disjointed utterance
came the half articulate words  " The winter
is past  the rain is over and gone. In 
manus  tuas  Domine."

His eyes looked at her wistfully, with their
fading light.

Kiss me  kiss me, Mary," he murmured.

Her lips touched his, and the warm tears
fell upon his chilling cheek, as with one faltering
word, " Nausikaa," the soul of the
good doctor passed away.

And they were Mary's hands which with
gentle touch smoothed the white hair which,
still untainted, fell round the ample brow of
the great scholar. It was she who wove
autumnal wreaths for the chamber of death.

Let us leave the sunlight with him," she

said ; " the rest of the house can put on its
mourning garb, but here let there be light.
Was it not light for which he lived ? "
And they let her have lier way, knowing how
the old man bad loved her, and sbe laid the
withered harebells on his breast and watched
by him all that day, whilst little Brownie
went and came and nibbled his nuts on the
window sill, sometimes peering round with
curious bright eyes as if he were seeking fora
welcome from the kind old friend who in
dying had not forgotten him, but had said 
*' Let Brownie have his nuts as usual."

VOL. II.

Safe, thou dark home of the dead,
Safe, hide his loved head ;
Keep him close, close in thine arms
Sealed up nth a thousand charms.

Richard Crashaw.

Has Joe Brunning left Sunnyside ? " asked
Mary later on in the evening of the same
day, after she, the Yicar, and his wife had
each given their loving testimony to the worth
of him who had been just taken from them,
dwelling upon each well-known attribute as
the bereaved always love to linger over, and
record the actions and ways of those who
have been very recently removed. ' Has
Joe left Sunnyside ? because I think that I
met him this evening as I was leaving
Braemar. I was rather startled for the
moment, as I was flitting along, to come

suddenly upon a man with a lantern, just outside
the second gate, on that narrow path.
He stood aside, and stopped short, but did not
speak, nor even give the customary salutation.
By the flickering light which the lantern cast
upwards upon him, I thought afterwards that
the face thus dimly shown resembled what
Joe might have developed into  at least it
reminded me of him, but he evidently did not
recognize me, and was apparently amazed at
meeting a woman on that by-path at that
hour, and alone."

Yes, indeed," said the Yicar, '' it was
very wrong and self-willed of you that you
would not allow us to fetch you."

Perhaps it was self-willed, but I know
every inch of the way, and my own thoughts
were companions enough. But tell me, could
it be Joe Brunning ? Where is he living, and
what is he now doing ? "

"You will be glad to her that Joe has been
living at Braemar for the last seven years.
Fletcher, as you know, died unfortunately at
Athens. He was imprudent, and he took
fever there, and our old friend has often told
us about the distress it occasioned him. He
was laid to rest in the pretty English cemetery


Illinois 

there, where the historian and Philhellene
Finlay is buried ; but his loss determined the
doctor to return home at once, as I wrote to
you at the time, although his health was
better in Greece than elsewhere, for having
thrown himself heart and soul into all the
aspirations of the modern Greek life he had
almost forgotten his ailments, but he could not
endure to remain absent from home when his
faithful Fletcher was no more, and upon his
arriving home, poor Joe being then out of a
place, he was taken on by the doctor, I expect
because he remembered that he had been one
of your loroteges!'

Then I fear my former garden has reverted
to its pristine state."

I believe that Stevenson keeps it up
after a fashion, but I have never seen it
since you left. Joe did not altogether please
Mrs. Hazelhurst apart from his frequent
collisions with Stevenson."

Poor Joe ! " sighed Mary, " he has a
good deal of stolidity in him, and requires a
gentle but firm hand to guide him, or else he
enwraps himself with a veritable porcupine
hide of resistance ; but what was his chief
offence? Mrs. Hazelhurst is a kind mistress.

and Helen had taken so strong a fancy to
my garden that I thought the thymy banks
might have thriven under Joe's care alone."

' But you see, dear Miss Myles, that they
were so much away, and perhaps it was left
at first too much to his own devices ; anyhow
his chief fault was laziness ! "

'' Joe, lazy ? Or was it not that Stevenson
continued his tyranny in respect to the
muck heap ?"

Well, no," said the Vicar, smiling, " it
was not exactly that; but Helen told* me
herself that whenever anyone went to the
Wilderness,' as it was called after you left,
Joe was always to be found  now, where do
you think ? "

Not in my arbour, surely?" said Mary,
and a faint blush illumined her cheeks.

You are just as sharp as ever," said the
Yicar, with twinkling eyes, " to think of
your making that guess 1 Yes, true enough.
Poor Helen would take her book or her
work, and sometimes at her persuasion Mrs.
Hazelhurst would accompany her, and when
they got to your haven of refuge, lo ! Joe
would be there sitting on your own log seat ;
yes, actually sitting, and of course Helen

could not deposit her silken skirts on the
place just defiled by Joe's corduroys. This
occurred several times, but the crowning sin
was, that upon one unhappy day they both
surprised him there with a pipe in his mouth
and smoking, so he had to go forthwith."

Poor Joe," said Mary. " Is he married ?
I promised to help him when he had fixed
upon his wedding day, but I never heard
from him."

Oh, no," cried the Yicar, again smiling.
Joe is particular, he can't find anyone
good enough for him. I think that he is
looking out for a erratum. I took him in
hand after the pipe business, and had him
here, and he did for us well enough, for he
is honest, and sober, and truthful. I also
appointed him to be gardener to the churchyard,
and so between these two posts he did
remarkably well, as far as wages were concerned,
for he cleared between them five-and-twenty
shillings a week, and began to increase
his deposits at the savings bank so
rapidly, that at this moment Joe looks upon
himself as a man of property who ought not
to throw himself away upon anybody ; but I
wish heartily that he would marry before

some little penurious ways, the outcome of
his praiseworthy thrift, get too much fastened
upon him. However, Joe did not like the
churchyard business, for he is a little bit
superstitious, and I believe that it was only
the little fees and the good pay that induced
him to take it in the first instance. He told
the sexton that ' A' don't altogether like
working near the winder where the erratum
was, for as he only saw her on the wrong
side, she seemed to be always looking at him
askew like,' you remember Joe's Suffolk
whine. As he generally had to do what was
required in the ground at the after part of
the day, and was almost always alone there,
it was at last too much for him, and he
wished to leave, when Dr. Grrantham offered
most opportunely to take him into his service
at once with the same wages that he earned
altogether, and there he has remained until
now, always having given his kind master
thorough satisfaction for his integrity and
faithful discharge of his duties, which, however,
were not onerous ; but Joe would be all
the better for a wife and two or three repaired
epitomes of himself. You must talk
him over, Miss Myles. It would be sad if his

thrift should degenerate into selfish hoarding,
as in our unbalanced lives it sometimes does."

The conversation then anrain reverted into
that channel which was more in kinship with
the feelings of the three, and the virtues and
learning of their departed friend was so
welcome a theme, and so thoroughly absorbed
them that the stumbling of a heavy
foot in the porch, and a correspondingly
heavy knock at the hall door passed unnoticed.
Visitors are not frequent at lonely
parsonages in the country after nightfall,
and therefore brown-eyed Phebe might be
excused for breaking into their conference
rather abruptly, instead of attending to the
summons from without, and saying with
much perturbation 

Oh, please, sir, there's somebody knocking
and making a dreadful noise at the front
door, and I'm afraid to go a-nigh it."

All people who have nerves feel them
more or less unstrung at times like the present,
and why not Phebe?" thought the Yicar.

Indeed, Phebe ; and is Jane frightened
too ? "

'* Lie's almost ready to go straight off into
a fit."

This is nonsense, Phebe ; making a noise,
do you say, or merely knocking ? "

*' Oh, sir, he do make a noise, and he keep
on a-coughing dreadful ! "

*' Oh, it's all right then. Go and open the
door, Phebe. I will follow. No harm will
happen to either of us from any poor fellow
who has a dreadful cough."

'but it's not a true, honest cough, sir; it
be put on."

And no one who means mischief, Phebe,
will herald his approach by a cough, either
honest or dishonest. Go and open the door
at once, lass, and show the man in," and the
Vicar followed her out.

But if the sight of Joe Brunning at anytime
were calculated to produce a little
flutter in Phebe's manners by his awkward
attempts at flirtation, it was not so to-night ;
for Joe Brunning, who was this unwonted
visitor, had not a word or a smile for her,
but stood still looking almost as pale as herself,
and, according to a favourite expression
of his own, " quite dazed like." He made
no reply to Phebe's sharp rebuke 

What ! Joe Brunning ! Was that you
making all that noise ? You've frightened

me and Jane almost out of our wits. Whatever
did you keep on croaking for, for all
the world like an old toad, and coming up to
the front door, too ? "

But Brunning this evening was not up to
the warding off with a counterstroke, however
clumsily delivered, any of Phebe's light
thrusts.

I want to see the master," he said, in
hollow tones.

Here I am, Joe ; put down that lantern
and come in," said the Vicar, cheerily, and
he, knowing that Phebe's propensity whenever
Joe called was to hang about, either
with a view to listen to Joe's voice, which,
husky as it was, had dulcet charms apparently
for her, or, as it was in the present
instance, from a desire to gratify a curiosity,
which, considering the paucity of events
which came to break the routine of a somewhat
monotonous and dull-toned life, was
also natural, told him to follow him into the
little study set aside for such receptions.

Well, Joe," said the Vicar, after he had
closed the door himself, " what is it ? Why
you look quite scared."

'' May well be that, sir ; I've  a  I've seen
a speerit.''

Nothing in that if it were true, Joe, to
send all the colour out of your face, my good
fellow, supposing, that is, it was a spirit of a
just one made perfect  for I do not accuse
you of having seen an evil one," said the
Yicar, smiling; *but I take the liberty of
contradicting you, and saying that you've
not seen either. You are a little bit upset
at the loss of your good master, and so weare
all, Joe."

Joe commenced shaking his head ominously,
and for a few moments could give out
nothing more explanatory.

"It bent that, Master Ashcroft; it bent
that."

*' Sit down, Joe, for a moment ; why you
are actually trembling all over."

But Joe could only articulate 

*' It bent that  it war the serrafum.''

Mr. Ashcroft could not refrain from laughing.


The ' erratum ' again, Joe. I hope that
you'll not worry it out of my church window ;
'tis the prettiest figure there."

I know that  I know that," said Joe,
still wagging his head solemnly; 'but I
believe, Master Ashcroft, she come out of t*

winder t' night, and ha' been to see the old
master."

"What! "

I see it, sir, as sure as I see you ; it war
just a-coming out of the gate. It war almost
pitch dark ; I had my lantern, and I war
just a-going to lock up the out-houses, and a'
meet it by the gate ; a' see a light in the
doctor's room as a' come along from the cowshed,
and a' see someone moving about the
room where the old master be lying, and,
believe me, sir, a' could see right through it,
as un sees through the erratum in the winder.
I felt the whole mash of my blood turn in an
instant ; an' then  an' then, Master Ashcroft,
just again the gate I see sumun
coming along, and I lift up my lantern and I
see"

What, Joe ? "

The face of the erratum out of the
winder looking out at me from out a hood,
but I wasn't a-going' to be dashed, Master
Ashcroft," continued Joe, in a prouder and
more confident tone, " so I go round by the
church as I come here, and sure enough that
side of the winder was pitch dark and there
war no erratum there."

Of course not, Joe, the buttress takes
care of that, it throws a massive shadow
upon that part of the window at all times,
but if all was pitch dark, as you just said,
I'm at a loss how you could make anything
out at all. You would be a lucky
fellow, Joe, to meet one of the Seraphim ; it
does not come to the lot of many. But clear
your brows and come with me. A very kind
friend of yours is in the library with Mrs.
Ashcroft. Follow me, Joe, and see the very
Seraph you met this evening in the person
of Miss Myles, your former mistress."

Joe did not speak ; his ideas always came
slowly.

Come, Joe," said the Vicar, encouragingly;
*' Miss Myles will be glad to see you;
she has been asking after you."

A little scuffle, as of a starched gown in
retreat, was audible to the Vicar as he preceded
Joe out of the door of the study.

I have brought you your old gardener,
Miss Myles. Joe Brunning has come to see
you," said the Vicar as he re-entered the
library, whilst Joe lagged heavily behind.

When Joe, after a few gracious words
from his former mistress, had begged her to

accept his duty, and then resumed his
lantern and trudged homewards somewhat
lightened in heart, anyone who had met
him and whose eyes could have pierced the
darkness might have seen him frequently
shaking his head dubiously, whilst he
muttered to himself 

'Tis wholly standing She be more like
a erratum than ever."

A Suffolk word.

No man can claim to usurp more than a few cubic feet of the
audibilities of a public room, or to put upon the company with
he loud statement of his crotchets or personalities.

* <- * * *

Halter was not a man of many words, but short in conversation,
told his opinion bluntly, and was obstinate and hard.

Emerson.

In the coffee-room of the Anglo-Indian Club
two gentlemen had just recognized each
other, and were exchanging the warm and
hearty greetings that old friends give and
receive at an unexpected meeting after the
lapse of many years. They were both elderly
men, and both wore a military aspect, but
one had evidently but lately returned
from a hot climate, and his deeply bronzed
face showed out in strong contrast to
the whiteness of his hair, his bushy eyebrows,

and his thick moustache. He was a
fine and distinguished-looking man, with a
very soldierly and frank demeanour, an over
frank demeanour maybe, if judged by the
conventional reticence of English society
generally, for he spoke loudly and with the
voice of one who had long been accustomed
to say '' Go " and to be obeyed, and his
phrases were garnished or emphasized with
sundry ejaculations, the most usual of which,
''By Jove" or "By George," like all other
invocations of the same nature, are now
almost obsolete among gentlemen both in the
army and navy, where were formerly their
head-quarters. His laugh was also loud and
frequent, and his whole appearance, notwithstanding
his sixty years, the last twenty of
which had been spent in active service under
an Indian climate, gave tokens of robust
health and fine animal spirits  a constitution,
in fact, upon which no mental strain had
ever long pressed  a good-hearted, jovial
man, with nevertheless a visible reserve of
power somewhere ; a man of whose bravery
and courage in the field, for instance, no one
would ever think it requisite to inquire  it
was stamped upon his whole person and in

every lineament with an impress that was
conspicuous to each beholder. It was also
very obvious that he had never been very
much used to the society of women.

"Upon my word, Colonel," said his friend,
still retaining his hand with a firm grip,
you bear your years well. You've not
come home invalided, that's quite certain."

By Jove, no ! I'm all right  all right,"
answered Sir Robert Hanbury, shaking his
friend's hand with ponderous energy ; '' no
liver troubles here, eh ? Complexion's first
rate, isn't it  that is, what you can see of it?
Ha ! ha ! ha ! " and he laughed long and
heartily.

It is really astonishing, Sir Eobert. You
are younger than half of our young men
even now, and by-the-bye I hear you're still
a gay bachelor."

Yes, by George ! without encumbrance,"
and again he laughed.

'' Ah, well !  ah, well !  never too late, you
know. Colonel ! I expect that you've come
home for a wife, and that now you'll settle
down among us like a respectable man.
Better late than never I I'll introduce you

VOL. II. r

to some nice girls, and be your best man
into the bargain when you've made your
choice."

I'm not a marrying man, Mason, and I'm
not going to make a fool of myself. By
George ! what should a man marry for at
sixty !  sixty ! I never had but one scratch
in my life  a pretty deep one though, by
Jove !  and I was close upon forty before I
got that. You remember ! " and the Colonel
knitted his shaggy white eyebrows and tugged
at his moustache.

Yes, I remember," said his friend, slowly,
and looking at the Colonel with surprise, " if
you mean  "

By Jove ! " interrupted the Colonel, somewhat
sternly.

But you don't really mean to say, Sir
Robert, that you have thought about that
affair all these years  you ! "

Not thought about it ! Why, I've not
got softening of the brain ! Of course I've
thought about it  that is, when I've thought
at all, not being much given to that kind of
thing, never having any time to spare for it.
But I tell you what it is. Mason. You know
what a lot of man-hunters come out to India

after us poor fellows. Well, by Jove ! that
girl's face always came up before me, and
was like a shield of protection. Ha ! ha !
Whenever a woman, maid or widow, made
eyes at me I couldn't help taking stock  
making an inventory  during the process,
and the result always was  ' You, after Mary
Myles ugh ! ' "

Ton my word, Colonel, you've not a
smaller opinion of your own personal merits
as regards the fair sex than you had twenty
years ago ! "

Sir E-obert's clenched fist came down
heavily upon the table and made the crockery
ring again, and a gentleman who was reading
at a table on the far side of the room
suddenly started forward in his seat, and
gave a searching glance at the Colonel, when,
sinking back again in his chair, he resumed
his former attitude, shading his face with the
paper he was reading.

''No," growled the Colonel, " I've not forgotten
it  never shall forget it. A girl
without a brass farthing, of no social standing,
to look me calmly in the face and refuse
me ! " and at the absurdity of the idea Sir
Robert again laughed out heartily.

*' Bad taste, wasn't it, Colonel ? " said Sir
Henry Mason, smiling.

'' By Jove ! " shouted the Colonel ; " I
thought at the time that the girl was clearly
out of her wits  beside herself."

Sir Henry leant forward and whispered to
his friend that they were not alone, as a hint
for the Colonel to moderate the tones of his
voice. The Colonel gave a hasty and indifferent
glance at the stranger before mentioned,
who continued reading, and went on
without heeding.

' I'm bound to say that no bomb or shell
ever startled me more. I never even took
the trouble to examine the outposts before
making the assault, nor took any time to
consider whether the result would be worth
the sacrifice involved, for, look you, I had no
doubt of victory, and then  then, as if I had
only been a pale, pettifogging lawyer's clerk
with a hundred and fifty pounds a year, she
said quietly, without any fluster, and in the
sweetest of sweet voices, ' No ! no ! no ! '
By Jove, though, what a lovely creature she
was!"

'' You had that consolation. Colonel, anyhow
 she was worthy of your admiration."

I never saw her equal before or since,"
said the Colonel, moodily. '' But what
became of her ? Married a curate, I suppose,
and had ten children, and is now a
mere rag of her former self, so to speak. '

'' No, you are mistaken. She is still unmarried
 at least, so I heard when I was
down in the North last year. I met a fellow
there who knew her when she was at Girton,
in fact, he also had had a scratch, as you
term it."

Girton ! Girton ! Why, that's the place
where they manufacture blue stockings, isn't
it?"

'' You are a little bit old-fashioned, Hanbury.
That epithet is out of date nowadays,
but as you have brought up the lady's
name I may as well avow that she is what
you would call a blue stocking."

*' Mary Myles a blue ! " shouted the
Colonel, in consternation.

Sir Henry Mason smiled.

Mary Myles a blue ! " repeated the
Colonel, in a low voice. " Why, Mason, the
first time I saw her she was in a swing in a
white frock and blue sash  a mere wisp of a
girl, not much over sixteen. I think I see

her now  her brown hair blowing in the
wind, and one of her little shoes had fallen
off. By Jove ! hers were the prettiest feet I
ever saw in my life ! It was those little feet
crossed over each other, and one hopeless, that
made a fool of me there and then.

' Colonel Hanbury, miss,' said the damsel
who had opened the gate. Did she jump off
in a hurry at being thus surprised? Not a
bit of it.

'* ' Colonel Hanbury, please pick up my
shoe,' she cried, smiling all the time as if there
was nothing unusual in the request ; ' pickup
my shoe,' and I picked it up directly.

For a moment I half meditated putting it
into my pocket, but she was holding out her
pretty hand with its pink palm ; and whilst I
was looking at that, she whisked it out of my
hand with the most provoking and childlike
simplicity, and slipping it on, jumped down
and said in the sweetest of voices 

*' ' Now I can shake hands, and say good-morning.
Colonel Hanbury. My mother is
within ; 1 will announce you,' and I followed
her as meekly as a lamb."

Well ? " said Mason, smiling.

'* Mrs. Myles was a delightful person ; her

husband had been an early chum of mine. I
had looked forward to meeting her, but when
that girl left the room  and I verily believe
she returned to her swing  I found no words
to say to my old friend's widow. For three
whole days and nights that girl was ever
before me. I don't believe I slept one wink."

Well ? "

Well ; why on the fourth day I was at
that garden gate again, I had a belief, see you,
that the swing was her morning occupation,
and the idea of proposing to a girl in a swing
rather tickled my fancy."

Proposing to a girl of only sixteen whom
you'd only seen once before ! "

Why not ? I'd nothing to wait for, had I ?
I'd got to years of discretion, eh ? "

Well, and was she in the swing ? "

"No, but she must have seen me snatch
the gate, for I had hardly entered the garden
before I saw her coming towards me with a
basket on each arm, a broad straw hat
shading her face, a blue cotton gown, and a
white apron and bib."

*I am so glad that you have come. Colonel
Hanbury,' she cried, offering me her gloved
right hand from under the basket handle ;

I am going to gather cherries, and you can
hold the baskets for me as I throw them in.
My mother is just this moment busy with
some household matters, so if in the interim
you will come and help me I shall be so very
much obliged to you ; and by the time we have
finished my mother will be able to receive
you,' and quite demurely and as a matter of
course she handed me both the baskets.

"thank you very much, Colonel Hanbury.
It is very kind of you. Follow me, please.
You must stoop your head,' she said, laughing,
as she held back a bough that hung low over a
side path. She looked so charming as she
did so that as I ducked under the green leaves,
and saw her rosy smiling mouth within a
foot of me, I felt a strong desire  But she
had shackled me with a basket on each arm.

' These baskets are tolerably heavy, too
heavy for you. Miss Myles, to have carried
even empty ; you surely did not contemplate
carrying them back when full ? '

' Oh yes. Colonel Hanbury, one at a time.
I am very strong, but you will be able to
carry them both at one time, will you not ? '

We were now at the cherry tree. A light
ladder was fastened firmly to one of the

branches. She skipped up it before I was
aware of her intentions. The tree was laden
with its beautiful fruit, which hung in ruddy
bunches more plentiful than the leaves.

* Now please, Colonel Hanbury, just put
one basket on the ground out of your hand,
and hold the other with both hands. You
see I should have been obliged to hang it on
a bough if you had not so kindly come to help
me.'

She then took off her hat and threw it
down. I stood below like a gawky schoolboy,
holding a basket while she plucked the
cherries and tossed them into it. I kept my
eyes upon her, and not upon the basket.

'' ' Why, Colonel,' she cried, ' you're not
looking ! The basket's full and they are all
falling upon the ground ! Put that down,
please ; and now for the other. But perhaps
you'll be kind enough to gather up those
that are fallen while I rest mj arms a little,'
and she sat herself down on the top rung.

Now, just fancy me grovelling upon the
ground picking up those cherries ! I suppose
I got red in the face, because presently she
said in a sweet and almost compassionate
voice 

** * But you look very, very hot, Colonel
Hanbury. Will you not like to rest a little
too?'

* Oh, no, no.'

I wanted her down from that ladder,
you see. Mason, out of that confounded
cherry tree. Every moment I was getting
more madly in love with her, and I wanted
to tell her so.

At last both baskets were full.

* Oh, thank you so much, Colonel. Now,
please, take them both up, and carry them on
towards the house. I shall soon overtake
you.'

' Can I be of no assistance ? ' I said, holding
out both my hands, but she had perched
herself on the top rung and had crossed her
little feet on another lower down. I saw the
blue bows on her shoes peeping out from
beneath her skirts.

' Oh, no ; thank you very much. Colonel
Hanbury.'

** I saw she was resolute, so that chance
was gone. T took up my baskets, one in
each hand. I had to hold my arms straight
down, of course  a more helpless, stupid
position for a man of my height and size can

hardly be imagined. You may well laugh,
Mason.

"As I turned my back and was moving
over I heard her spring lightly to the ground.
She was putting on her hat when she joined
me again.

' I can hardly thank yon enough, Colonel
Hanbury,' she said, ' for thus pressing you
into my service ; but you see we have no
regular gardener, and we keep no boy.'

Sir Henry Mason laughed outright.

' Colonel Hanbury,' she said after a while,
as I had said nothing, * do you like cherry
pie ? If you do, and will stay dinner  we
dine at two, but you can make it your
luncheon, you know  you can taste the
cherries you have helped to gather, and I
am going to make the pie.'

' It delights me, Miss Myles, to hear
yon say " pie." I always hear them called
tarts," and I hate the word ; " tarts," as I
understood them in my schoolboy days, were
uncovered little kickshaws.'

* My dear mother. Colonel Hanbury,
likes old-fashioned words, and she has
brought me up in old-fashioned ways also,
so I make all the pies, puddings, and cakes.'

' For your sake, then, Miss Myles, I will
submit to a possible attack of dyspepsia, and
never refuse pie, pudding, or cake when I
take luncheon here.'

*' She lifted her clear grey eyes to my
face.

*" If I thought dyspepsia would be the
result. Colonel Hanbury, you should not be
offered anything of the kind when you are so
good as to come to see my mother ; and I
hope you'll come often  but my pastry never
causes dyspepsia. Will you sit down and rest.
Colonel Hanbury ? I will go and find my
mother.'

She motioned me to a garden chair, but
I did not sit down.

I know you think me a fool. Mason, in
telling you all this, and I can't tell how it is
that I remember it all so well, considering
the life I've led since."

*' I think such events in our lives are
always remembered," answered Sir Henry,
sententiously.

* By Jove ! ' I thought, * here's an opportunity
! ' You see, I'd quite made up my mind
to take the plunge, and I wasn't going to
hang about dawdling week after week, so I

straightway made use of my opportunity.
Standing before her I put out my right hand
and took hers.

* You are not going, Colonel Hanbury ?
You'll stay and taste my cherry pie ? '

'* ' I hope so I said, and held her hand.
I am a soldier, you see, my dear young
lady, and am rather blunt, and not used to
pay  to pay compliments. I prefer to speak
to you before I see your mother. The upshot
of this little preamble is that I love
you.'

She looked me at once in the face with
wide open eyes, without a blush, in the most
unblushing manner," said the Colonel, laughing
at his attempt at a joke, " and she made
no reply, so in rather plain fashion I blurted
out 

'' ' I ask you to be my wife.' I suppose I
ought to have trembled a bit, but I'd never
trembled in my life before an enemy, so I
wasn't going to stammer before a young girl
when I was offering her a position she could
never have dreamed of, but she looked at me
with as proud a look as if it had been my
groom and not I who was proposing to her.
Like a fool I took pity on her youth and

ignorance, and repeated the question. She
had allowed me to retain her hand all this
time, mind you, so to push on the siege
more vigorously I pressed the little soft
hand as I repeated : ' I ask you to be my
wife, my dear girl ; it doesn't take much
consideration to say Yes, does it ? ' "

'well?"

'' Well, she hastily withdrew her hand from
mine, and looked at me steadfastly with those
eyes of hers, as I just now told you, and
answered very slowly 

' But the answer, Colonel Hanbury, if
you are really serious, which I can hardly
imagine, is Sto ! ' "

'' And so ended your romance."

"Well, I did just think that the girl
might have some sneaking kindness for
some young fellow which was blocking the
way, and that when all the advantages were
put before her she would doubtless reconsider
her verdict  not that I had any
desire to play Number Two, supposing that
might have been the case ; although I was
forty-two or thereabouts, and she just sixteen.
Nevertheless, after making my bow to the
damsel I did go straight to the mother and

told her my dilemma, asking her if there was
any prior attachment, and she fired up just
as if the question implied an insult, and
gave me such a look.

*'*My dear child, Colonel Hanbury, has
but just entered her seventeenth year.'

' Well, my good lady,' I answered, ' if it
has not been in your experience, it has certainly
come under mine as a fact that girls
and boys often have their little love affairs
without the knowledge of papa and mamma.'

'* I had put my foot in it.

' Mary is not one of those girls,' she
said, haughtily ; then, regarding my penitent
demeanour, added : ' I would gladly have
seen her the wife of a good and brave man,
and I am sorry for you, but her " No " means
no! '

*' The next day I was on my way to India,
and after twenty years I come back to find
her  not married to a curate, but worse 
an old maid aud a blue  a blue ! What a
narrow escape I had ! "

"Not a very narrow one, eh, Hanbury ? "

Sir Robert Hanbury made no reply to this
covert hint of his friend, nor saw the half
smile which accompanied it. He was moodily

regarding the tablecloth. After a few minutes
in this apparently absorbing occupation, he
looked up, and, regarding General Mason
with a determined air, said, in low and
measured tones 

'* I tell you what it is, Mason, I was a
fool  a confounded fool  in not stopping
for luncheon. I ought to have known better.
I behaved myself like a miserable sub.
There was not a bit of generalship in anything
I did. Oughtn't I to have known
what a mere drummer boy ought to be
whipped for not knowing, that any commander
who brings all his forces against the
enemy without first attacking and securing
the outposts is a fool for his pains and
deserves to be well thrashed ? If I had
stayed luncheon, and taken some of her
cherry pie and praised it, and asked for a
second helping, and, in defiance of a frightful
indigestion for a month, had a third helping,
by Jove ! I believe that that girl would
now have been Lady Hanbury ! "

Forgive me for smiling, Hanbury, but
your cherry pie episode recalls a well-known
distich scratched on the pane of a country
inn 

In memory of the cherry pay
That cost half-a-guiney."

But Colonel Hanbury was in no mood to
laugh at another man's jest, if jest were
intended.

Sir Henry Mason, however, seemed mischievously
bent upon playing upon his
friend's idiosyncrasy of self-approbation, so
remarked with a twinkle of his eye 

But she's not done so badly after all,
excepting, of course, that she's not Lady
Hanbury. I heard last year when I was
down in the north that she had gained the
highest honours  was a classical tripos,
man."

A classical tripos ! a classical tripos !
Merciful heavens ! "

** And is now head-mistress of the Chip-pelham
College for Girls, with a salary of
five hundred a year; not so bad for your
penniless little girl, eh, Colonel ? "
The Colonel sprang from his chair.
Worse and worse," he roared. *' Mary
Myles a school-mistress ! By Jove, it serves
her right ! "

The stranger laid down his newspaper
and crossed the room on his way to the
VOL. II. G

door. As he passed he bowed slightly to
Colonel Hanbury, who returned the salutation.


Do you know that gentleman ? " observed
Sir Henry.

He was one of the passengers in the
Guatemala. I believe that he is a Judge of
some eminence in Bombay, but somehow we
didn't get on together during the voyage. I
rather think our politics did not coincide. I
did not recognize him until he bowed, and I
cannot recall his name at this moment."

Sir Robert walked to the window.

Mary Myles a school-mistress ! " he muttered.
" Mary Myles a blue ! "

love, my love ! If I no more should see
Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee,

Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,
How then should sound upon Life's darkening slope
The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,

The wind of Death's imperishable wing ?

Rossetti.

When in the lives of men and women the
dial of time scores a flight of ten years, the
index points to moral or physical changes as
obvious as the sun's record on the dial-plate;
but in the life of a woodland tree ten years
leave hardly a mark of their passage. There
is no appreciable advance towards decay and
dissolution. The child may frolic and dance
over its roots, and again as an old man, with
trembling hands resting on his staff, he may
stay awhile his weary feet beneath its shade ;

whilst the tree itself is still in its glorious
prime. Thousands upon thousands of short-lived
creatures each fleeting summer have
made merry in its branches ; song and gladness
have re-echoed there for many decades,
and the tiny players of pipe and tabor have
smouldered generation after generation in the
deep leafy mould beneath. Birth-place and
hunting ground of myriads of enemies, who
are slowly but surely working its destruction,
scooping out its very bowels to make them
bridal couches and nursing cradles, it is yet
an object of grandeur and beauty, all unwitting
that its very life-blood is being
sapped by tribes of little despised borers,
tunnelling its mighty stem in every direction.

The chestnuts of Sunnyside glade, save
that their arms stretched yet a little further
towards the woodland path, were unchanged.
Chestnuts are not as sturdy as the oak, to
whom age is a crown of glory. The years
piled on years bring them decrepitude and
palsied limb, but on the other hand the
ravages of small enemies are fewer, and they
succumb to time, not before the armies of
insect invaders.

The chestnuts of Sunnyside glade had

passed unscathed through the past ten years
which had stripped off many a noble arm
from their not far distant neighbours by the
joint attacks of lightning and storms, without
its being apparent why they had been so
mercifully passed by, when the tempest and
whirlwind rushed in blind fury over the land
and had laid so many others low.

Beneath a dull November sky, their golden
leaves yet remaining, loosened by last night's
hoar frost, were fluttering down in showers.
Their rustle as they fell was the only sound
that met the ears of a solitary figure, who
stood long rooted to the spot immovable 
chained, as it seemed, by some enthralling
memories.

A tall, powerful, bearded and sunburnt
man was this visitor to a seldom trodden
spot. A grave man, over whose temples the
hair, elsewhere so thick, had somewhat fallen
away, which added still more to the noble
breadth of brow. That brow was marked a
little prematurely when viewed in contrast
with the other features ; they looked like
lines of thought rather than of years, and
the deep cut between the eyebrows spoke of
a honos habit of knitting them, the result

often of suppressed feelings of indignation,
but always indicative of gnawing cares  a
stern face on the whole, with firm, well
closed lips. His age might have been
guessed to be between thirty-five and forty,
but a second glance would possibly qualify
the first impression of the beholder, and give
rise to the added remark 

It is possible that he looks much older
than lie is."

He was bareheaded, holding his bat in his
hand, although the wind that with no gentle
hand lifted his hair was sharp and searching,
and the thick double piled overcoat that he
was wearing showed that he was not indifferent
to cold.

It was no soft emotion that overpowered
him, although his eyes scanned the stem of
the larger tree on the mound with the eagerness
of a lover searching for a mistress's
cherished name ; and if those were really
tears with which his eyes glistened, they
were tears which made the line between his
brows to deepen, and his lips to close yet
firmer.

God forgive me," be said, after awhile.
*' I ought not to have come here first," and

>
covering his head he turned away s suddenly
in the direction of Sunnyside.

Mrs. Hazelhurst had received a telegram
on the previous morning announcing her
nephew's arrival in England, followed by a
brief note which signified that it was his
intention to call upon her on the following
day. He had not written to her throughout
all this interval of ten years, until his reply
to her letter upon his mother's death, which
response was singularly brief, considering
the occasion. She had felt wounded by his
seeming neglect. At first she had hardly
expected it, but when that fleeting futile love-dream
of his had vanished into thin air, she
had hoped that occasionally he would have
written, or showed in some other way that
his old affection to the ever-kind aunt of his
boyhood, and to his early little playmate,
was again reasserting itself.

From time to time, as she listened to her
sisters glowing description of his rapidly
advancing career, and his brilliant prospects
in the future, her thoughts had again inclined
to the possibility of the alliance cherished of
old, and in this she was encouraged by Mrs.

Langridge. Helen had refused several offers
she seemed resolutely set against marriage.
"What other reason could be assigned for this,
but that she secretly and tenaciously clung
to the girlish remembrance of her handsome
cousin ? India somehow did not now seem
too far off for her child. He would retire
early  that intention he openly avowed to
his mother  he would eventually take up his
residence in England. Such a future as was
held out to her would compensate for parting
with her daughter for a year or two, and
so the thought thus entertained grew and
grew, until it occupied her mind almost as
fully as formerly.

What a devoted son he was ! His letters
to his mother were curt, certainly, but then
he was overwhelmed with serious employments.
That he worked terrific hard to
attain all that he achieved was self-evident.
A position so unwonted at so early an age
was not acquired without personal cost and
sacrifice, but Mrs. Langridge was satisfied.
Almost every mail brought her some token of
his loving care for her  some choice Eastern
gift, increasing in costliness as the years
brought him increasing wealth. What shawls,

and rugs, and embroideries, and carved
work found their way to her home ! Not one
doit would he ever receive to diminish her
income since the hour he found himself
dependent upon her, or since that *' silly
affair," as his mother put it, which, after all,
had not turned out so badly ; as he was evidently
bent upon convincing his mother that
he was not the weak fool that she had
thought him to be. Everything showed to
Mrs. Langridge that the films had fallen
from his eyes, and that each earnest endeavour
of his life was to coincide with her
every wish. Yes, it had been a good thing,
a providential thing after all. India could
give him more than England. Here he must
have waited a lifetime for one quarter of the
results that had now accrued to him from the
service of a few years. In England how he
must have toiled before he could have got a
name ! Now he had both wealth and honours.
There was as yet, no hint from him of any
intention of marrying, but his mother had no
desire that he should ally himself with any
Anglo-Indian girl. She had once ventured
to write : " When you pay your promised
visit to England, dear boy, I suppose that

you will not go back again without a wife."
And he had written in reply : " I do not see
ray way clear to go to England so soon as I
expected. When the announcement for
which I am waiting comes, I shall go, but
not before ; but if it does not come before,
expect me, at any rate, in the tenth year.
Then I shall possibly stay a whole year in
England, and assuredly I shall not return
hither without my wife."

This letter, a longer one than usual, Mrs.
Langridge sent to her sister. " Glorious old
fellow," she wrote, "he is doing exactly
what I would have him to do. T am told
that a baronetcy will probably be offered to
him on his retirement, so I am in no hurry ;
and our dear Helen will not harm by this
delay." And Mrs. Langridge, with her
increased means, was equal to the occasion,
and received and paid visits in a style
befitting the mother of a judge and a possible
baronet.

But she, the mother, had died suddenly a
few days before this tenth year had dawned.

With sad thoughts, as she revolved all
these things in her mind, Mrs. Hazelhurst
looked forth from the same library windows

from which she had seen the handsome
youth with clouded brow drive off just over
ten years since, and  The gate swung
back. Was that bearded, bronzed, hard-visaged
man who lifted his hat in recognition
the object of her thoughts ? Could
he be Herbert Langridge? A strange
feeling of disappointment, almost of repulsion,
crept over her. How different was this
coming home to all she had pictured ! Was
this man her Indian Prince ?

Whilst still these feelings were predominant
he had entered the library rather
abruptly, and not waiting to be announced.
A silent embrace was his greeting.

You hardly know me'' he said, after a
pause. " I see it in your face, my dear
aunt ; but really I am no counterfeit, I am
still Herbert Langridge  by name, anyhow."

*' And by nature, too, I expect," said his
aunt, graciously, recovering herself and faintly
smiling. ** Welcome  welcome home! Ah!
how sad it is," she said, sighing audibly,
"that your dear mother no longer lives to
welcome you ; to think that the meeting to
which she ever looked forward was never to
be!'

Mr. Langridge had taken a seat. He
shaded his face at those last words, leaning
his elbow upon a table near.

But my mother was suddenly taken
hence," he said, huskily ; " her death-bed
was not clouded with those regrets."

*' That is true ; but it does not make the
loss any more endurable for those who are
left. Rather the contrary. So many hopes
so many visions of a future, that never
was destined to come  haunt me still. Poor
Elinor ! "

'' But was not my mother happy ? It was
my constant endeavour that every wish of
her heart should be gratified."

And you can take that for your consolation
Herbert I never knew before how much
my sister's heart was set upon such things ;
but latterly she looked ten years younger,
and at her receptions was as attractive as the
youngest beauties present."

Mr. Langridge made no answer.

You have come without any luggage. I
presume you left it at the station, Herbert ?

'' I have only come to-day for a call,
aunt."

For a call ! after all these years ! But,

of course, only a preliminary one to a very
long visit. You remain in England a year, I
believe ? "

Not now, aunt ; no, my visit will not
exceed two months. Things here, you see
are altered for me ; and now with the view I
still hold of retiring in four or five years, I
hardly care to take too long a holiday ; but
dear Helen, she is not married I hear. How
is that, aunt ? "

An awkward question, as Mrs. Hazelhurst
took it, but she evaded it.

Helen is difficult ; she has had splendid
opportunities, but I am not sorry to have
her still all my own. She is out riding just
now, but you will see her at luncheon ; but
now, as you have touched upon matrimony,
I suppose that I am not far wrong if I venture
to hazard a remark upon yourself. Do you
take a wife back with you ? "

*' That was the main object of my visit to
England," he said, dryly.

Mrs. Hazelhurst smiled inwardly.

'' His heart is set upon my Helen," she
thought ; *' but how blunt he is. I am not sure
that she will see you with the same eyes as
formerly ; " but she said aloud, " You have

allowed yourself but a short time to make
your choice. Two months ! ''

My choice was made ten years since."

Mrs. Hazelhurst pushed back her chair.
The grating words  the cold, hard voice  the
stern face turned towards her took away all
power of reply.

Therefore have I come," he continued, in
the same dry tone, " and therefore do I seek
you now as a petitioner having a favour to
ask ; but, aunt, you look frightened. Is my
aspect so grim as all that ? "

I hardly understand you, Herbert," faltered
his aunt.

Well, then, to be explicit, I have come to
England to claim the hand of the woman I
loved in my boyhood ; but don't be alarmed,
aunt, I am not mad."

Your voice sounds cruelly harsh, Herbert.
Am I really to infer that you are actually
alluding to Miss Myles ? If so, such an idea
does almost seem to me like madness. What
would your poor mother say were she alive ?
Miss Myles is now a middle-aged woman 
faded, precise, and care-worn ! "

*rand what am I? Look at me! You
see me brow-lined and furrowed from hasting

to be rich ! And what else is there within
that you do not, cannot see ? A heart prematurely
hardened from this pursuit of wealth
and honours, a life from which all poetry has
been reft  crushed  cruelly crushed out.
And my mother never relented  not one
word ever came from her of sympathy or pity !
Look at me  in the lower sense  a success ;
in my higher nature  a wreck; a Will
machine with all the cogs and wheels moving
in admirable adjustment ; but a machine,
after all, without a soul ! "

Good heaven ! Herbert, that unfortunate
attachment seems to have blotted out all
natural affection. It is horrible ! "

My mother, in her pride, asked for
success  she spurned love away from her.
Year after year I toiled day and night, I
forestalled her every desire. I toiled, I say,
day and night in the darkness of grief, obeying
her implacable commands to the very
letter. 1 waited, and waited in vain for the
message which never came. I heard it sometimes
in the watches of the night : * Come
home, my son, and marry the woman you
love ; ' but it never came. That noble woman
had bound me to this blind obedience. ' Your

mother is a woman,' she said, 'she will surely
be touched by your filial love and devotion.
Wait ! and if in the course of years your constant
service wins not a spontaneous acknowledgment,
you can then go to her with a
clear soul and ask your release. You can then
say, " Mother, I have done all this for you ;
have you nothing for me in return ? " ' And
this is the tenth year, and I am here, but my
mother said not one word, and she is in her
grave."

Your mother was under a wrong impression,
Herbert. She thought that you had
overcome that  that early predilection, but
now, even now reconsider it. Miss Myles, I
have only seen her once, but that was lately
at poor Dr. Grantham's funeral, and although
she was at some distance and veiled, I could
see by her general bearing that she was
much aged, and who could expect otherwise
in ten years ?  ten years make their mark in
any woman  and when one has to earn a
livelihood by teaching the natural result
must be that such a woman would change
more than another. If she were not the
wife for you, my dear Herbert, ten years
ago, depend upon it she is less suitable now
than she was then."

Look you, aunt," said her nephew,
springing to his feet. " I knew not whether
she were alive or dead until two days since,
when T accidentally overheard her name
alluded to by some old friend of her father's,
a fellow traveller, addicted to loud talking.
Had she been dead, mind you  had I come
home to find two graves instead of one 
think not that I would have buried the love
of my youth in her grave, and left it therefor
the grass to grow over, and my heart to
blossom into another new, fresh flower of
love. No ! I would have sought her grave,
but I would not have left her there and
turned my footsteps back into the world to
seek forge fulness and oblivion. I would have
borne those dear remains back with me,
back to India, far away from this cold
island, and its colder people, and there in
India, in old heathenish fashion, I would
have builded a splendid mausoleum, and
waited again, waited for ten years  twenty
years  for I am strong, and sorrow does not
kill me, as you see. I am as obstinate in my
body as my soul ; what I will, I do. Yes ! I
would have waited till I could sleep with
her the sleep of death ; but she lives, thank

VOL. II. H

God, she lives ! and you tell me in order to
change my purpose which has also lived
these ten years that she is * faded ! careworn
! precise ! ' Be she ' faded ' she is
my own. Every line that I shall number on
that dear face, each, each one will show tome
the record of how they came, and through
what they have come."

He is raving, he is stark mad," thought
Mrs. Hazelhurst, but she merely observed
coldly, *' The simplest solution would be
her six-and-thirty years. You are unjust,"
she continued after a pause, " unjust and
unfeeling, when you thus covertly allude to
my sister, your mother. She was apparently
mistaken, she judged you as any reasoning
being would have judged you from your acts.
Being away, she  all of us  had no other
means of judging, and she, and all of us,
thought that you were endeavouring to
show her that you wished to atone for  well,
in short, that you heartily repented of your
folly."

What, aunt ? did my mother who knew
me as I was then, better than anyone else,
did she think of me so meanly after all?
Was she proud of me only because I worked

to gain, strove for an object, and knew of
me nothing beyond ? Could lie imagine that
in the higher affections I was really possessed
of such a poverty of soul that I could
win a woman's love with ardent words and
worship, laying down my life almost at her
feet if she had asked but for it, and then
shift off and fling it away, as a newly-donned
garment, no longer required, is cast aside
when the sun cones out and warms a cold
spring day ? My mother thought that ? my
mother ! Yet if she did think me so miserable
a wretch as your words imply, she was
more guiltless than I thought. She was not
then indifferent and heartless. She knew
not that I suffered. Is this, can this be
true?"

She had no misgivings of any sort, none ;
of that, Herbert, rest well ass used. Believe
me, knowing your mother as I knew her, it
is with no small anguish of heart that I thus
plead my sister's  my sister's cause with her
own son, but it is true. Two years ago, alluding
to that event now so painfully brought
before me again, she said to me, ' How
thankful Herbert must be that I withstood
his boyish caprice. Every action shows it,

dear fellow ! He is of too noble a nature to
speak of it in direct terms, as he could hardly
do so without some disparaging remarks
upon the lady who was the cause of it ; but
the facts speak for themselves. ' "

Herbert covered his face with his hands
and wept.

My poor mother! my poor mother ! These
are the first tears that I have shed since I
left England. I wept not when the news of
my mother's death was brought rae, though
my eyes were like balls of fire ; but no tears
came to moisten them. O, God ! I thank
Thee that I can weep again. My poor mother !
you cast away from you the true riches of the
heart, and losing a son and a daughter were
satisfied with the counterfeit coin of the world
paltry gewgaws of wealth and pomp ; poor,
poor mother ! "

'restrain yourself, Herbert; you are not
talking as a reasonable man should talk, much
less as a wise man who is proud of his steadfast
will. I cannot listen any longer if you
indulge in these wild tirades, and persist in
reflections upon my sister."

Aunt, forgive me. For ten years I have

been but a dry stick. This outburst is welcome
; it shows rue that the sap of true
vitality is DOt altogether extinct. I am
thankful that I can weep."

What is the favour which you spoke of
but now ? " she said, anxious to divert the
conversation into a different channel.

Simply this. That my marriage may take
place from your house, and that you will
kindly ask my intended bride to take up her
residence here until all my arrangements are
completed."

That can hardly be, Herbert. Upon reflection
you will think you have done wrong
in making such a request."

I have well considered it, aunt ; it is no
sudden thought. My sole idea is to honour
her, and from this house, where she bore
humiliation so nobly, I desire that she shall
go forth as my bride. You cannot deny me.
Is it so unreasonable a request r If Helen
were here I would ask her if she would not
be glad to do honour to a lady to whom she
owes so much."

** Luncheon is about to be served, Herbert ;
we will talk it over by-and-bye."

*' I have no time to adjourn it. I take the
afternoon train to London, and by the first
express tomorrow morning I journey to the
north. After arranging the preliminaries of
my marriage I have to settle my mother's
affairs, and I have other matters to attend to
in connection with my appointment in India,
so you see I have not much time to lose."

Helen, entering at this juncture, met her
cousin with frank warmth ; but her surprise
was equal to her mother's.

How dreadfully he is altered," she said
to herself over and over again; but when
after luncheon her mother drew her into
another room and hastily told her all the circumstances
of the interview and her nephew's
request, adding, parenthetically, '' He must
be mad," overcome by sympathetic pity, she
murmured 

*' Poor fellow, poor dear Polly. Oh, mother !
darling mother ! do let us have the wedding
here," and sobbed aloud on her mother's
shoulder.

A few minutes after both women re-entered
the library with tearful eyes. Going up to
Herbert Langridge, they each laid a hand on
either arm.

This dear girl has prevailed. Bring your
intended bride here, and, since you will have
it so, may God bless you both," said Mrs.
Hazelhurst, and laid her right hand upon her
nephew's head.

And ever as their shadows threw

Themselves athwart the crimson pane,
White arms the casement backward drew

And stretched toward the swelling main.
The day is done, the night is nigh.

The boats are hasting to the lee.
On what far shore becalmed doth lie

That bark should bear my love to me."

A COLD, drizzling rain was falling when
Herbert Langridge arrived at the great manufacturing
city of the north. " Drive me to
the best and nearest hotel," he had said; but
the best did not happen to be the nearest, and,
for reasons of his own, as the traveller was
evidently a stranger, the cabman who received
this command responded to it by taking him
to a second-rate commercial inn, the altogether
jaded look of his fare suggesting to
the driver a hard-worked bagman rather than

an Indian judge. In too impatient a mood
to order him to drive elsewhere, and possessed
with that spirit of irritation which almost
welcomes a condition of things that justifies
it, Herbert flung himself from the vehicle
whilst objurgating the stupidity of the driver,
whom he nevertheless gladdened by more
than double the pay due to him, and, entering,
ordered private rooms.

Private rooms, however, were scarce at
*' The Merry Bells," and although fires of the
largest dimensions were blazing away in the
coffee and public rooms, there was none in
the dingy little apartment into which he was
shown.

Let me have a fire quickly, and anything
for dinner that you have in the house, only
quickly,' ' he said, shuddering. " Have you
no bedroom with a fire in it, where I can
refresh myself with some soap and warm
water ? "

I am afraid, sir, that all the best bedrooms
are full. But I'll soon make a fire in
the room next to this. But do you want a
fire in both rooms at once? "

Yes, make as large a fire as you can
in both rooms, and soon. Be quick, be

quick, my good girl ; don't you see I'm
perished ? "

The ready application of a coin not often
offered to her occasioned first a stare of surprise,
and secondly gave rise to a conscientious
scruple, which surmised that another
coin of similar dimensions but of a paler
colour might have been intended.

Do you know what you've given me,
please, sir ?" she said, holding it out displayed
on her not too clean palm.

Yes, yes ; do make haste."

Oh the power of a tiny bit of gold ! Wood
and coals in a few moments were flaming and
roaring up the wide old-fashioned chimney
whence a few moments before the down
draught brought into the room the commingled
odours of soot and damp. Without
removing either travelling or great coat,
Herbert drew a chair close to the fire, and,
heedless of scorching, thrust his booted feet
up to the very bars. " To-morrow, then, I
shall see her," he murmured. It hardly
seemed possible that he and she were to meet
on the morrow, and nothing in the expression
of his face showed therein the anticipation of
a great joy. *' Poor thing ! careworn and

faded," he muttered, and the line between his
brows deepened. " Well 'tis no great matter
to me now," and he thrust back with his heel
a blazing faggot of pine which was about to
precipitate itself into the room. " But 'precise
old maid ! ' there's the sting. Can it be possible
that she has narrowed down into a thing
of formalities  a walking Greek grammar?"
he groaned aloud. " It's possible ; we are
never stationary  ever moving onwards,
either on the upward path still broadening
the higher it goes, or dwindling like the* unused
functions of some of the lower animals,
or fossilizing as I have been. Poor Mary !
why should I ask more from her than I find
in myself ? It has been a long, long mistake,
and it was a miserable weakness in me to have
yielded as I did before that claptrap word 
duty ! duty ! duty ! Enforced duties are
wretched failures always. If I had taken my
own freehanded course it might have been all
well now; I could have braved anger, cursing,
or poverty, and defied the whole army of
malicious and inimical influences, had she,
as I knew her and adored her, ten years since,
been by my side. But now ' careworn and
faded!' yes, no doubt 'a woman working for

her livelihood naturally gets careworn and
faded in ten years.' " He started from the
chair and paced the room.

This, once the great bugbear of the majority
of gentlemen, and still lingering in the breasts
of many, namely, the unfitness and the unloveliness
of gentle womanhood earning its own
livelihood, had always been intensely felt by
Herbert Langridge when younger, and before
he left England. It resulted from the brave
and warm generosity of his character, and
from the high estimation in which he held
women, and from no meaner motive. Ten
years since there was a momentary recoil
when his newly-found goddess, his hamadryad
faded away into simple Mary Myles, the
governess, and his residence in India had
served to strengthen those opinions. It is
true that after the first shock which had
reduced his sylvan divinity to a young woman
who was his cousin's instructress had subsided,
there had been a new fascination in the, to
him, unwonted alliance of feminine loveliness
and grace with learning ; but now that was
gone which had made her for him, so noble a
personification of all that was beautiful and
charming.

'Tis no matter now," he repeated, with
bitterness ; " both our lives are spoiled, so
we'll mourn together over the embers of the
past."

Dinner being announced as ready and
awaiting him, he returned to the sitting-room
which he had left in order to re-arrange his
apparel ; but although no fault could be found
in the preparation of that which was placed
before him, he ate but little. Disquieting
thoughts and unavailing regrets are poor
appetizers.

A sound as of an organ or harmonium came
indistinctly through the closed curtains.

Whence comes that dismal noise ? " he
asked, testily, of the young woman who was
promptly responding to the previous order of
Clear these things away."

Dismal, sir ! Don't you like music ?
Why, we think a deal here of the Marigold
Guild, and it's their night for practice."

And, pray, my good girl, what is this
Marigold Guild that is thought so much of? "

The Guild of St. Mary's. They're the
work girls from the great factory, and they're
getting up their Christmas oratorio, and they
wear a marigold for their badge."

Two words had fallen upon the ears of
Herbert Langridge, " Mary " and " mary-gold,"
and gentler memories touched him.

"It is a long while until bedtime," he
thought. " Where, then, is this Guild, my
girl ? It must be somewhere near at hand,
I suppose, for the sounds of the instrument
to be heard thus ? "

It is only two or three minutes off, sir."

I suppose anyone can go in by paying ? "

*' Oh, no, sir, no one ; leastways, no gentleman,
and this is especially a close night. But
you can hear them quite well in the porch,
and the Lady President is worth listening to,
I can tell you."

A sharp bell summoned the damsel away
as Herbert was about to ask a further question.


'Tis just yonder, sir  the hall I mean
if you've a mind to walk over," and she
jerked her hand in the direction as she
hastily left the room.

No, sir," said the doorkeeper, as Herbert
tendered him a coin, '' this is not a public
night at the Institute. It is given up one
evening in the week to the Guild of St.

Mary's, and this is their night. The Lady
Foundress is there to-night, and I have strict
orders to keep the doors locked. Those are
the Rector of St. Mary's orders, who is here.
The girls sing very well. They are now on
Elijah. You can hear them very well here,
sir."

Herbert Langridge gave a careless glance
through the inner glass doors. There was a
group of some thirty to forty girls at the far
end, and a female figure, half concealed by a
curtain, was seated at the organ, by whose
side stood a gentleman in the garb of a
clergyman. There was nothing to interest
him in this, so Herbert was about to turn
impatiently away when three clear voices
broke forth in the sweet song of the angels
to the sleeping Elijah, and at once arrested
his departing footsteps. The girls of Yorkshire
and Lancashire have good voices
generally, and possess the musical instinct.
The purity of their intonation and the
quality of their vocal organs in their rendering
of that delicious strain of melody immediately
exercised a subtle charm upon him.
He drew close to the glass again and listened
intently. He hardly heard the final bars, for

his worn spirit, like that of the tired prophet,
seemed borne away into contact with the
Invisible.

I think, sir," whispered the doorkeeper,
"that the Lady President is going to sing
now. I see the Rector speaking to her.
You must stop to hear her."

Again Herbert leant towards the panes. A
firm but delicate touch played the opening-bars.


Ah ! " he cried aloud, startled out of
himself, " my favourite air, ' rest in the
Lord.' " He involuntarily raised his hand as
if to enjoin silence upon the man at his elbow,
as a voice of rare mellowness swelled through
the hushed air as it sung with equal sweetness
and power that divine song. Touched
by some secret sympathetic awe, his heart
throbbed violently. " Who is that lady ? "
he asked the doorkeeper, hastily.

*' The President and Foundress of St.
Mary's Guild," answered the man. *' But
please stand on one side, sir; I must unlock
the door, they are coming out."

A tall, graceful figure was being carefully
cloaked by the Rector, who assiduously drew
the fur-lined hood closely around her face.

As they passed through the door, she leaning
on his arm, the Rector addressed some
words to her in a low tone which obliged her
to turn her head towards him. Her trailing
skirts brushed Herbert as she went by, and
an indefinable thrill ran through him. With
somewhat more of spiritualized feelings than
had for a long period visited his breast
Herbert left the porch of the Institute.

The Rector's wife, I suppose. Well, she
has a dignified and graceful bearing, and a
most superb voice. He's a fortunate man Sofar,
and apparently he knows it."

Saying this he walked away hastily, not
waiting to observe that the Rector of St.
Mary's only handed the lady into the carriage
standing outside, and that he himself stood
looking after that same carriage as long as
it was in sight, unmindful of the falling
sleet.

Wait patiently on Him, and He shall
give thee thy heart's desires."

These words  these words alone  were repeating
themselves in his brain. The tones of
the voice in which they were sung were vibrating
in his ears as Herbert Laugridge sat until
long past midnight gazing into the fire which

VOL. II. I

now in full ruddy glow illumined the heretofore
dingy room at his hotel. He had extinguished
the lamp ; the firelight alone was
more congenial to him in his present mood.

"And He shall give thee thy heart's
desires."

What desires," he thought, " and what
heart ? A heart in unison with Him  desires
in subjection to His will ? "

A panorama of his own heart's desires for
the last ten years seemed te unroll before
him. Had not his heart been straying
farther and farther away from all spiritual
influences day by day, week by week, month
by month, year by year, throughout all that
time until now  until now ? Aud what was
he now ? Whose fault was it ? Was he not,
even now, ready to lay all that accumulation
of hardening worldliness upon one who was
dead, and that one his mother ? Was that
true ? Had he not blindly obeyed his own
will, and seen nothing better than to follow
his own will ? A gentle voice had bade him
above all things to fulfil his duty to that
mother. Had he done so ?

What a plain, bare duty was that he had
given. How bald, how destitute of the

commonest attributes of filial love had been
his conduct to that mother ! How cold had
been the feelings which accompanied all
those choice and precious gifts which he had
poured into her lap ! How scornful were
his receptions of her warm and appreciative
acknowledgments ! How bitter were his
thoughts of her when in his rapid glances over
her letters he found not the words he wanted
to see ! What blessing could follow gifts
given in such a spirit ? Not of such suff
was the counsel given him bj that loved
woman. His mother, too, had been deceived ;
she had taken the dross for gold. How could
she think that the beloved son of her heart
would send gifts in scoffing ?

E-est in the Lord'* As he had listened
to those words that night the scales seemed
to fall from his eyes. Yes, he had been
heartless all these years to the mother who
had borne him. How could he look upon the
face of her who had bidden him sacrifice
love for duty, and had told him that his
reward would come ? Could he say to her in
all sincerity, '' I have done all that you bade
me to do. In loving reverence have I served
my mother, and my reward has been that her

heart was closed, tliatlier ears were ever deaf
to the voices of my supplications that were
ever silently appealing to her." Alas ! what
voices were these? Could the worked gold
and the precious stones, the tapestries and
embroideries touch the finer portion of her
woman's nature ?

He had debased it and hardened it by
pandering to a latent weakness  a weakness
which had never been so fed before. He
had nursed her love of pomp and parade, so
long subdued by the higher power of maternal
love. He had injured her as he had injured
himself, through the pride of life, the pomp
of wealth ! Even now but now  as he was
nearing the goal, as he was approaching
what he once looked forward to as his only
earthly felicity, he was undervaluing the
prize for which he had waited and toiled so
long.

Careworn and faded."

These depreciatory words had not so much
annoyed him personally as they did by conveying
to his mind what would be the estimation
of the world at large. He wanted
bis wife to be the admired of all ; he wished
to be the envied husband of such a wife. He

had desired that he himself through the
holiest affections should be elevated on a
pedestal, and receive laudations from the
crowd. A little shiver of discontent ran
through him as he thought that he was
about to bear back to India as his bride a
lady who would be regarded as " careworn,"
faded," and '' precise."

Then again with quick revulsion of feeling
he asked himself if all these newly-entertained
accusations were true ? Was he the unsoiled
thing he made himself out to be ? Was he a
worshipper of materialism only ? Had they
not been means to an end for which he had
been really working, and that end to secure
the sweetest companion and most helpful
helpmeet any living man could possess ?
Was it not an unright thing to deem himself
so debased, whilst hoping in the twilight
hour, after all the burning heat of the days-man's
toil had been borne by both that they
should rest together in the cool of the evening
hour ? Was it good to hold an opinion
so low of the man who sought to be that
woman's husband ? Had he been altogether
absorbed by ambition, would his breast have
kept that little untended taper burning

clearly so long  would not the rough winds
of ignoble desires have quenched it long ago ?
Peace he had not. He had not " rested in
the Lord " nor waited patiently for Him ;
but his soul was not sullied by any stain of
impurity. The desires of his heart were not
wholly alien from the perfect life, and " the
peace that passeth all understanding " might
yet be his.

'* Henceforth I will strive to wait patiently'*
was his prayer that night.

When on his bed, tired as he was when
sleep at last enfolded him in her restful arms,
it was no image of the lost hamadryad of his
youth that visited his pillow and stood by it
as a dream ; it was a tall, gracious figure,
who held in her hands a chaplet of marigold
which she was about to place upon his head,
whilst she sung in subdued tones, as if for
him only, '* 0, rest in the Lord, beloved of
my soul."

The morning was well awake, and awake

with all the smiles a wintry sun can wear,

when Herbert opened his eyes, refreshed in

body and mind. The bells were chiming

from some church near as he concluded a

rather hasty breakfast. They were old bells,
and their sound fell gratefully upon his ears.

*' Those bells are very sweet; I suppose
they are much thought of ? "

Yes, we are all very proud of our bells,"
answered the hostess, who herself had come
to inquire after his welfare, and how he had
slept. '' The bells of St. Mary are renowned
for miles, and many a triple bob major has
been scored by them. We are in the parish
of St. Mary, so of course we stand up for
our bells. And we like our Rector also ; Tie
has as true a ring in him as have the bells of
his church."

I suppose that the foundress of St.
Mary's Guild is the wife of the Rector of St.
Mary ? "

No, no ; not quite that," said the landlady,
smiling and shaking lier head. " 'Tis
no fault of our Rector's, though, that she is
not, so folks say. Well, well, it'll happen
some day, sure, for he's waiting patiently
enough, and them as wait always get what
they want. She'll not get a better husband,
though she's well worth any man, as sweet
and worthy a lady as  "

But before these last words were uttered

Herbert had strode across the room as if he
were not listening to the good woman's
peroration, and, with a gesture of indifference,
had taken up his hat and was about to
leave the room abruptly.

"What time for luncheon, sir?" said the
landlady, in a sharper tone, and with an air
which was evidently rather ruffled.

I hardly know ; I will take what there is
in the house. I may be detained."

** Umph ! " said the landlady, '' too proud
to listen to the answer after having asked the
question."

Gossip of any kind was distasteful to
Herbert, and therefore it was that the moment
the private affairs of the Rector of St. Mary's
Church and the foundress of St. Mary's Guild
were about to be discussed by the landlady,
to him, a stranger, he had seized his hat and
had unceremoniously quitted her without
asking the one question which was really
uppermost in his mind, namely, the way to
the Collegiate School for Girls.

This question, thus deferred, he asked
therefore of the house-porter outside as he
left the hotel, and receiving for information
that it was fully a walk of twenty minutes'

distance, and beyond the city ; he started at a
brisk pace in the direction pointed out, with
a heart comparatively light and unburdened.

The Collegiate School was a handsome
modern building, and the style of its architecture
was of a character in accordance with
the purposes of its structure, being more
simple and severe than ornamental in its
details. He had been told to ring at the
private door on the right wing, and not at the
middle gate if his purpose were to see the
Lady Principal. His hand actually trembled
as he did so, and for a few moments he looked
blankly at the trim, exquisitely neat damsel
who responded immediately to his summons
without finding any words wherewith to address
her. When he did so he merely ejaculated


*miss Myles."

Miss Myles, the Lady Principal, sir, is not
at liberty to receive calls until one o'clock."

Take my card in to her at once, if you
please."

*' I cannot do so, sir ; my orders do not
allow me to enter the class-room except with
a telegram'*

Herbert felt irritated.

'' I have come some distance ; my time is
precious. Let your mistress know immediately
that I am here."

I cannot disobey my mistress, sir," said
the girl, with an offended air. " It is now
past twelve ; leave your card with me, and if
you call at one, the Lady Principal will have
left the class-room for the day. She is never
there in the afternoon ; she will then most
likely receive you."

The damsel evidently perceived Herbert's
irritation at this slight thwarting of his
desires, and her last sentence was influenced
by the wish to assert her dignity and to show
him her responsibilities, as well as by an intention
of soothing him by holding out the
possibility of the whole afternoon for him if
her mistress so willed.

Herbert had long been a ruling power  a
small despot, as it were  and when obstacles
were presented to him they were, apparently,
as ninepins, which only stand up for the express
purpose of being knocked over as soon
as possible. He gave his card, however, and
walked impatiently away.

The expression " Lady Principal " annoyed
him above measure. He began to connect it

with the objectionable word *' precise ; " but,
nevertheless, all unknowing as he was, he was
already under a different teaching, and more
tractable than he had been one day since, so
that the absurdity of his fretfulness was soon
apparent to him, and again the singer of last
night and the words of the singer came back
to him.

How strange that that lady should come
into my thoughts at this moment," he said to
himself. It almost seemed like a treason that
he should be thinking of any other woman
than one. He suddenly stopped short in the
midst of his rapid strides. " ' Not his wife,'
she said, ' but soon to become so.' Were not
those her words ? That voice, the Marigold
Guild, our flower  what, what if she should
prove to be  Good God ! Shall I meet her
only to find her the promised wife of that
middle-aged rector ? "

Every particle of colour faded from his face
as this thought took possession of him ; but
the long habit of judicial reasoning to which
he had been committed in the most important
years of life's mental training, had greatly
checked the imagination and idealistic faculty
once so prominent.

Absurd ! " he said, resuming his walk.
Cannot a middle-aged rector have chosen
an elegant-looking woman with a fine voice
for his second wife, as I presume, without my
rushing to the absurd conclusion that she
might prove to be the very woman to whom I
once plighted my faith and whom I have come
here to seek ? The Guild of St. Mary's takes
its name from the parish of St. Mary, and if
a badge were needed, what more suggestive
than that they should choose a marigold, the
flower of St. Mary ? "

Never had one single hour seemed so long
before. The minutes seemed to drag one
after another. Often he took out his watch
and held it to his ear, thinking that it must
surely have stopped. The distant chimes of
St. Mary's at last announced the coming of
another hour, and before the last echo died
away at the stroke of one, Herbert stood again
at the door of the Lady Principal's house,
nor waited long. The trim maiden responded
immediately as before, and, without pausing,
opened the door of an adjoining room and
held it aside for him to enter.

No sooner had he passed the threshold of

the apartment indicated than he became
conscious of an invisible presence. Simple,
almost to severity, yet without giving any
impression of bareness, the few pieces of
furniture were all conspicuous for their perfection
in taste. Books, engravings, vases,
hangings, all told the same tale  not wealth,
but refinement. It was evidently only a
room for granting receptions, and although
the eyes of the mind were chiefly gratified,
there were yet one or two chairs easy enough
to invite a temporary rest.

Herbert felt a pleasurable emotion rising
within him, and drew a long breath; but
what demon of doubt at this inopportune
moment whispered to him, " careworn, faded,
precise ? "

He hastily walked to the broad bay window
and had partly drawn one curtain to shade
the too strong light. He did not want his
first glance at that loved face to be too
fraught with regrets. His hold was still
upon the curtain when a slight sound made
him let it fall from his hand. He looked
round ; a figure stood in the doorway  a
graceful figure. He saw but the fine outline

of a pale face with an aureole of bright brown
hair. He moved not  he could not speak.
Two arms were outstretched to him ; a few
quick, noiseless steps and a woman lay on
his breast and clasped his neck ; then, only
then, as his head stooped to her face, then
only one word escaped him 

Mary," he said, and they held each other
in a long and silent embrace.

A nervous tremor suddenly shook the
strong man as he looked in silence on the
fair, calm brow of the woman who clung to
him, and spasmodically he clutched her still
closer to him.

'' Is it your very self, Mary ? Your very
self?"

Am I so old and changed, dear, that you
do not know me ? " she whispered, bending
her head back towards the light.

There is something awful in your beauty.
Why are you so calm ? Have you not
mourned at all through those years?" he
asked, tremblingly.

Were you not my husband all those
years ?"

There seems such a gap between us. I
am as far from you, though I hold you in

my arms, as far as the earth is from the
heavens ! "

The heavens must bow themselves, then,
and come down," she said, with a smile, and,
lifting her face to his, she kissed him on his
mouth.

For we live by hope
And by desire ; we see by the glad light
And breathe the sweet air of futurity ;
And so we live, or else we have no life.

Wordsworth.

How the minutes glided, quite oblivious of
the agonies of the kitchen potentate and the
early dinner hour ! The two newly restored
to each other only thought of their present
blissful reunion. At last, with an effort,
Herbert wrenched his mind from the now to
the future, and to its practical obligations.

'' Now, my Mary, to plain homespun. On
what day, at an early period, can you leave
this place of exile ? "

** Exile ! I am under engagements that
oblige me to stay until Christmas. I cannot
leave until my successor is appointed, and

then there is the oratorio ; but why leave
until  "

*' A fortnight after Christmas we sail for
India, Mary, and I have much business to
transact between now and then. I want to
make sure of my precious possession in
yourself at once, and I have, therefore, made
arrangements with my aunt to receive you
at Sunnyside until our marriage can take
place at the earliest opportunity. You must,
therefore, come out of your heaven of calm,
and submit to a little vulgar bustling, so that
you may be able to leave here in a day or
two. Why, what troubles you so much in
that thought that you change colour? Clouds
already in the fair translucent heavens ? "

With unfaltering voice she answered,
quietly 

<< I grieve to be obliged to say No, dearest
Herbert, but it cannot be, I cannot go to
Sunnyside, I cannot be married from your
aunt's house."

She rose as she said this, and stood erect,
looking taller than usual from her resolute
attitude. They were tears even that shone
in those eyes that but a moment before had

VOL. II. K

made Herbert tremble with their steady,
placid light, and cower within himself at the
thought that she was too high for him  she
who could bear grief and separation without
their leaving any marks ; whilst they had
seared him  heart and brow  as with a hot
iron.

'' Hither  hither," she said, in a low firm
voice ; " hither came I as to a refuge ; here
have I known peace  here, 0, my Herbert,"
and her head fell upon his shoulder. " Here
I have been honoured ; here more than all I
have felt what it is to be free. Sunnyside,
as I now look back upon it, was to me then
but a comfortable prison, where I could only
keep alive my inborn love of freedom, by
sometimes indulging in wild freaks which  "

A burning blush now overspread her whole
face as the occasion of their first meeting
came vividly before her.

Herbert Langridge understood what
memory it was that their first meeting had
conjured up, and saw how indecorous it might
now appear after ten years' interval in the
eyes of a Lady Principal, but his heart gave
a quick flutter, for the picture of his hama-dryad
had ever brought him light in the

darkness. He said nothing, but drew her
nearer to him.

"Mary," he said, tenderly, '' my only wish
has been to exalt you, if need be, in the eyes
of the world, and to" he paused, seeing
how gravely she regarded him, " well, to do
you honour  to have you honoured in a house
where upon my account alone you met with
discourtesy."

*' Do me honour ! do me honour ! " There
was a sudden gleam in her eyes, and a still
warmer flush mounted to her cheek. '' You
mistake, Herbert ; I would rather be married
by a hedge priest like a ragged beggar girl
than be taken to Sunnyside expressly that I
might go forth thence as your bride in compensation
 "

'* My Mary ! Athene of the tranquil brow,
can then be angry," said Herbert, half smiling;
but is it well ? "

Yes, it is well. The sun shall not go
down upon my wrath, but unless a certain
vow made some years since could be turned
inside out, you will yourself see that for that
cause alone it cannot be."

What vow, and by whom vowed ? "

*' Oh, the vow of an unregenerate one who

responded to a well-meant, perhaps sincere,
courtesy on the part of Mrs. Hazelliurst,
which expressed the hope of my visiting her
occasionally, by a silent bow which sealed
the unspoken words, ' Only as the wife of
Herbert Langridge do I pass through these
gates again.' "

And that was your vow as you drove
away from Sunnyside, was it?" said Herbert,
tenderly, " after you had inculcated upon me
the duty of passive obedience?"

*' We were outside the gates, Herbert, and
I was no longer in your aunt's employ."

You are a casuist, Mary," he answered,
smiling ; *' but let be, your vow shall have all
due respect from me. But wherever the
ceremony takes place, all arrangements must
be hastily made, and preparations hurried
forward, as my time is so short, and 1 have so
much work in hand, and there is one thing
which of itself will give me no end of trouble.
I must secure a secretary before I go back,
and to find a good one is no easy task."

** Let me be your secretary, Herbert."

*' You, Mary, you ! Do you suppose that
even were you able that I should allow it for
one moment? You, as my wife, must take

up a certain position. You have had enough
drudgery in England ; but in India, as my
wife  "

An amused, half merry look banished
every trace of recent shadows as she said 

 The glamour of India is upon you,
Herbert, with all its paraphernalia of punkas ,
palanquins, elephants, and howdahs." She
laughed outright. '' Fancy Miss Myles, the
governess, with a score of black slaves in
turbans and tinsel fanning her ! Who knows
but in time she may learn to chew betel nut?
Ah ! woe is me if I may not work ; your
India then would kill me in a year ; but
again I say, let me be your secretary."

"Ah! I am already beginning to feel like
a married man," said Herbert, laughing,
but there is one great obstacle, Mary,
which you cannot get over. My secretary
must have a good knowledge of Hindustan."

'' The candidate now soliciting for the post
has a good knowledge of Hindustan."

What ? "

'' She has a good knowledge of Hindu-stance."


*' You, Mary?"

Why, Herbert, how do you suppose that

I could have glided through those ten years
without  "

'without what?"

"Without being scored and wrinkled in
every direction, and without my eyes being
blurred and red with weeping ! The learning
of Hindustan to make myself a helpmeet
for my husband, has had a larger share in
keeping me in sweet restful ease than even
my guild or my bees, whilst I was waiting for
you, waiting for you, my love, for I knew
you would come back; I knew you would
come back."

Herbert gave no answer. The awe that
had mingled with his old admiration of far-gone
days seemed to be again reasserting
itself. He drew back the curtain still further,
and looked at her in silence.

The action of moving the curtain brought
to her remembrance how he was employed
when she was about to enter the room.

Why were you intending to draw the
curtain, Herbert, as I came in ? Did you
wish to meet me in the darkness ? "

Herbert looked at her. How could he
tell her what had impelled him to do so ?
That he had been so faithless in soul as to quail

before the epithets "careworn," 'faded?"
Truth at all cost ! Is that always the maxim
for noble souls ? Whether it should be so or
not, or whether the subtle evasions of Eastern
minds had somewhat impregnated his own
we know not, but Herbert answered after a
pause 

Look at my forehead, Mary, and there
you will read my reasons for placing myself
in the shade."

Mistrustful son of earth!" she answered,
smiling, shaking her head as if the truth of "this
statement was open to dispute. '' What a
thought for such a supreme moment ! But
whence came such a squadron of marring
lines? See, now, I will count them  one,
two, three, four  why, there are ten, large
and small," her fingertips touched them
lightly as she spoke. " Ah, my love, your
thirty years should not have stamped such
signs upon your brow."

'' Ten, are there ? Then it is, indeed, a
faithful record  one for each year that I was
banished from your presence, Mary."

*' Is it so ? then I must needs love the
record, though it might have been traced
with a gentler pencil, but they shall not be tome

as a record of a bitter past, but the
testimony of an ever-abiding truth ; and now,
with the persistency of a woman when
desirous to gain her point, will you grant tome
 supposing my capability be established
  the post of secretary ? "

As you will, you very woman ! "

Then, having so far gained my way,"
she resumed, laughingly, " I must now reconsider
your demands. I will send in my
resignation this evening in order that my
successor may be appointed as soon as
possible. Then there is the oratorio to which
I am pledged, and bitter indeed would bethe
disappointment to my poor girls if I
should fail them. These duties and others,
which I owe to my present position at Chip-pelham,
once fulfilled, then I am yours 
yours in will and in deed for ever  evermore."


What is this about an oratorio, Mary ?"
said Herbert, his brows again clouding.
Am I to understand that you sing in
public ? ''

Ah ! I have not told you that I have
founded a guild here, to raise and dignify
womanhood as represented by ray poorer

sisters who work here in factories, and
music is one of our chief educators. Once a
year we give an oratorio, and I am pledged to
sing one air on that occasion. My singing
that one air once a year gives me more
loving authority over my guild than  But,
Herbert, you look displeased."

As my wife," he answered, coldly, " you
must not sing at oratorios."

As your wife, no ; as the wife of my
Indian prince, no. But it will not be as
your wife, dearest, that I shall sing at my
last oratorio in Chippenham."

She laid a hand on each shoulder as she
spoke and regarded him with anxiety.

I know that it has become a fashion
lately," he continued, gloomily, *' for great
ladies who have fine voices not to be content
with singing in their own drawing-rooms,
but, under pretence of charity, to seek the
applause of the concert-room, and thus
air their vanity. My wife must not do
this."

She shall not, Herbert. But, alas ! for
my girls  my dear girls who have looked upto
me so long, and who love me as devotedly
as I do them  if I fail them now  You do

not ask it, Herbert ? Not yet being your
wife, you will not ask it ? "

There was no answer.

I have had nothing but kindness and
honour lavished upon me since I came here ;
and now that the supreme joy of my life
draws near  the privilege of walking by
your side, by your side, my dear"  there
was a little sob  '' until the goal of earth be
reached  must I forget those who have
helped me to pass these years of waiting so
easily, so easily ? Could you, could you ask
it ? You need not be present on that occasion
if it so chafes you even to think upon ;
but it concerns my honour to complete
certain engagements, and not to leave with
one page, although the last page of my life
here, rent asunder from those preceding it.
For that evening the protecting presence of
the Rector of St. Mary's will, as heretofore,
be my aegis  if one be needed."

The Rector of St. Mary's ! "

The truest, the best of friends. No
breath of silly gossip could ever waste itself
on a Lady Principal or foundress of a guild
around whom he threw the shielding arms of
his goodness."

'' Indeed ! "

Yes, indeed. But why do you repeat
indeed ' with such a tone ? *'

The Rector of St. Mary's and the Lady
Principal looked truly a comely couple last
night, but I knew not then that it was my
own betrothed that he was so tenderly cloaking,
and who left the hall hanging upon his
protecting arm, and whom he accompanied
home with his shielding presence."

Ah ! were you there ? Were you the
muffled figure in the porch whom I saw aS I
drove  as I drove away ? Oh, my dear,
dear love ! and I knew it not ! " Again her
faithful, loving arms closed round her doubting
lover's neck. " Herbert," she said,
gravely, drawing back her head and steadily
regarding him, " the Rector of St. Mary's
has had the honour of the foundress you
allude to thus, so much at his heart that he
would not plant his foot upon the step of a
carriage in which she sat. The Rector of
St. Mary's walked home through the snow
alone."

He is a widower, I hear. Do not some
people connect your name with his in another
fashion?"

Her arms released his neck.

Foolish tongues may wag for ever ; those
who heed them not can walk steadfast. The
hot sun of India, Herbert, must have burnt
into your brain to speak like this to me.
Ten years since you trusted me in a graver
matter than this, and asked no questions.
Alas ! my Herbert, this is worse than separation.
But if I am on my trial, know that
the Rector of St. Mary's is one of those
priests who incline to think celibacy a better
state for the clergy than marriage, and
who shrinks with horror from any second
nuptials. Had it not been so the Lady
Principal, at thirty-six years of age, might
have thought differently about the foolish
tongues."

She was silent. Herbert took her hand
and kissed it.

'* You will forgive me, Mary. I am not
as I was ten years since. I have much to
unlearn, much to unlearn."

And I much to learn."

Not of me, my poor love ; you can never
learn of me."

"I learnt the best of all knowledge ten
years ago from you, Herbert, and it can

never be unlearn," lie answered, calmly.
'' There, you were the sole teacher."

*' Whatever was it?" he asked, again
venturing to draw her close to him"'

Love ! " she answered, firmly.

I was but a pupil teacher, dearest, under
you, under you ; " and peace was again
sealed, and the old trust began to return to
his heart once more.

A faint, very faint, knock at the door
caused Herbert to look at his watch.

 Why, my dear Mary, 1 have been here
two hours ! It is three o'clock. At what
time do you dine or take luncheon?"

At two, and my visitors are limited to
ten minutes. No doubt the cook has been
most alarmed."

'' I have transgressed ; I will now go.
To-morrow night I go to London. At what
hour may I venture to ask an audience before
I start?"

'' At the same hour as to-day."

I will not forget then what is due to the
Lady Principal of a girls' collegiate school,
and will only stay the allotted ten minutes,"
said Herbert, laughing.

If you please, the Rector called to inquire
if you had escaped taking a chill last night,
ma'am. He asked if he could see you, but 1
told him that a gentleman from foreign parts
was with you."

''My own dear love," thought Mary,
hardly heeding the girl's remark, *' has
surely learnt to be jealous ! Would he
have shown such symptoms if he had found
me quite destitute of any womanly grace,
whether of mind or body ? Strange inconsistency
of the human heart ! It hardly
seemed to bring him the gladness that I
thought it would have done, to find that I
was not even now altogether untimely. He
was all irritation, doubts, and fears. He has
been sorely tried  sorely tried. I fear that
he has trod the narrow path of duty, but
failed to gather flowers by the way."

And strange, indeed, it was that he who
through ten years of silent separation never
had one moment's doubt of the constant
devotion and faith of her whom he loved,
should merely by the contemplation of her
matured dignity of charms and grace, so
utterly unexpected, have felt a sudden impulse
of feelings never entertained before.

The solution of this odd problem of the
heart was that for ten years he had been
giving  giving, had been looked up to, and
received honours, and able himself to bestow
them, whilst at the same time he was indulging
a secret sense of a great injustice 
narrowing influences all of them.

He had made up his mind that his betrothed
was suffering equally with him, probably
more so. His pride through all his bitterness
felt a noble consolation in a certain sense, in
the daily reflection that were she spared to
him he would repay all  he would shower
gems upon her  would repay all her trials
with every accessory that station and wealth
can bestow.

He forgot for the time that all those things
which he would have to give were valueless
in her sight. But what else could he do for
her? He could not restore her lost youth
and loveliness. This bitter thought was
often the sole companion of many a sleepless
night. What fierce obstinacy flamed up
within him when his aunt recalled to him
that, over which he had so often himself
pondered with heart-woe unspeakable 
"careworn," "faded." Coming from her.

although they were but the echoes of his
own thoughts, how he revolted from them in
anger !

What impotent determination was his that
at all price she should be admired  that he
would raise her  that she as his wife should
be honoured for that fact alone ; and now,
instead of being able to use that omnipotent
power in a glorious spirit of defiance, he
finds a still most attractive woman, in full
enjoyment of her many talents and accomplishments,
some of which  as her gift of
song  were in fuller splendour and more
developed than before. Moreover, a calm,
rare-souled woman, enjoying her intellectual
life, blessing all around her, and being
blessed. A full life, apparently. What had
he to add to it ? He saw that he had
nothing except himself, and he felt it to be a
somewhat tarnished self from that other self
which had won the heart of that incomparable
woman ten years since. The old love had
never relaxed its hold, but it had glided more
into the region of a memory than a reality.
He had, as it were, to resuscitate the old
feelings before he could be glad in her beauty.
Here was nothing for a noble pity to raise or

lift up. The old sacred, awful love of his
unsullied, ardent young heart was reasserting
itself, but with the alloy of jealousy. When
that was cast out before the steadfast light of
her purity he would again be himself.

All these thoughts, mixed with some
shame, he revolved in his slow walk back to
his hotel. Once or twice he was nearly upon
the point of returning  returning to cast
himself at her feet, and kneeling there, to tell
her how bitterly he felt his own unworthiness,
and to implore her to bear with him; but
he checked the thought. He knew that her
lofty spirit would be wounded by his self-humiliation.


No, not by abject contrition from which
I myself might afterwards recoil can I enthrone
myself again in a heart like hers."

These were some of the regretful thoughts
and musings to which he gave himself up,
but poignantly as he felt a certain amount of
commiseration for himself in that he had lost
so much way, yet he felt that with her by
his side, retrogression and progression would
be one, even though the glowing poetry of
his youth could not be revivified.

VOL. II. L

The thoughts of the Rector of St. Mary's
as he also trod his way back dwelt exclusively
on " the gentleman from foreign parts " so
long closeted with the Lady Principal of the
Chippenham Collegiate School, for the neat-handed
Millicent had unnecessarily enlarged
upon the circumstance of this visit of a
strange gentleman. So unexampled a procedure
as her mistress retaining a casual
visitor for the space of two hours, was too
great a strain upon her usually compelled
reticence. The equipoise of her mind was
disturbed. She had been accustomed to the
stated calls of the Rector every other day, or
at intervals not less than two days at the
most, but he never stayed more than the
allotted ten minutes.

In the summer time he went into the
garden to look at the bees  it was wonderful
how great was the attraction of Miss
Myles's bees for him. He had bees of his
own  her bees were an off-branching family
from his own stock. He was an accomplished
bee keeper, knew all their habits from minute
observations of years, but yet it seemed as
if he had always something to learn of a
more valuable nature from the bees of the

Collegiate School. But when summer works
were over the bees could no longer require
his domiciliary inspection, so his calls were
then expressly to inquire about his two little
girls, aged respectively thirteen and eleven,
who were scholars at the College ; but then
he never sat down on those occasions, but
would stand hat in hand and exchange a few
civilities, sometimes even objecting to the
door of the reception-room being closed as
not being worth the while, for he had only a
few seconds to stay ; he had just to ask a few
questions about the Guild, of which he was
so staunch a supporter and patron. The
frequency of these visits excited no surprise
in Mary's heart. His wife had been her
dearest friend, her visits had been almost
diurnal, and as they usually came together,
"Mary had been quite habituated to his intimate
little calls before his wife died, which
was now five years since, and she would have
greatly missed them had they ceased with her
death, although the character of them was
necessarily modified.

A friendship between a man and woman
when no thoughts of love or marriage are
likely to obtrude, is more perfect than any

other, as well as more fascinating, and in this
instance there was no such innovation as a
possible lover to be dreaded which would have
been destructive of the restful attachment in
which adviser, brother, and pastor seemed
all united in the person of Mr. Bretton.

Mary was attached to him ; she appreciated
his reverent and courteous behaviour, his
careful watch over himself in all his intercourse
with her, so guarded and yet so
considerate and kind in all things, like indeed,
a good elder brother. She had perhaps
wondered occasionally, why he came so often
to inquire about the bees ; but she found the
solution in the great gap made in his home
by the loss of the intelligent companionship
of his affectionate wife, and hastily put the
questionable suggestion aside, and if anything
were wanting to strengthen her
reliance upon the disinterestedness of his
attentions, it was the strongly asseverated
opinions which the Rector avowed of the
desirability of a celibate clergy, and of the
great scandal of second nuptials.

A gentleman from foreign parts has been
two hours already with my mistress."

Mr. Brereton repeated this to himself with

some anxiety. For two or three years following
upon her arrival at Chippenham, Miss
Myles had been the subject of much speculation
in the society there. She was so
eminently attractive that there must be
some reason why she was not already
married. Of course she had met with a
disappointment, but would soon forget it in a
new conquest. After a very little while the
community at large voted her a puzzle.
They could not aflB.x the term '' disappointed "
to a lady whose cheerful serenity was* one
of her most marked characteristics, and they
could not accuse her of setting her cap, as the
vulgar phrase has it, at anyone in particular,
as her general attitude was one of lofty
aloofness; but it was reserved for the rising
medical man of the district. Dr. Swepstone,
physician and surgeon, to promulgate another
decided opinion, and quite explanatory, why
a woman who had beauty and grace could
appear so naturally oblivious to the superior
advantages which matrimony offered her.
And the way Dr. Swepstone arrived at his
explanation of this physiological contradiction
to the womanly proclivities, was in this
wise. He knew that a wife was a necessary

adjunct to the medical practitioner. He
was looking all about Chippenham and its
suburbs to find a lady worthy of being Mrs.
Swepstone. He wanted wealth with her,
but he was sensible enough to know that a
very attractive, amiable, and accomplished
woman would stand him in more stead in his
profession than a rich girl who did not possess
those qualifications ; so he deliberated.

When, however, the new mistress appeared
like a meteor on the dull manufacturing mind
of Chippenham, his mind was made up. He
would have preferred that Miss Myles had
not been a lady principal, but nevertheless,
here was an opportunity not to be lost. So
elegant and lovely a woman had never before
greeted his sight ; her fame for learning was
obscured by her quiet gentleness, and what
a voice ! He had means. What receptions
he could give with her to preside ! Long
extended visions of rising higher and higher
on the social platform, helped on by such a
consort, flitted before Dr. Swepstone. He
was thirty-five ; there was no time to be lost.
His mind was made np, and he called after
his third interview with her at the Rectory,
to offer her the honour of his alliance.

But he called at inopportune times, and
was not admitted ; he left his card, and his
sister called and left hers ; but Miss Myles
gave but a cold glance at either and forgot
them, so there was no help for it ; he must
make his proposals in a letter, a proceeding
to which he was most averse, considering
that his personality and its strong claims
upon an universal admiration would thus
be lost. However, he had no doubt of
success ; any woman would pause twice, he
considered, before committing the egregious
mistake of giving a refusal to the offer of his
hand  any woman of sense, that is, who was
gifted with sufficient discernment to be able
to appreciate both himself and his position ;
and Miss Myles was a person capable of
such discrimination. So he wrote. This letter
was one of the many stereotyped productions
of that class wherein the self love of the
writer is so evidently the principal factor in
the production that no finely-worded metaphors
can obscure it. Hastily running her
eye over the neat phrases which showed how
utterly destitute the writer was of any real
feeling, which want had compelled him to
make use of the disguise of many high-flown

words, Mary laid it on one side with indifference
; whilst she perused with real sympathy
the many applications from professors and
lecturers; often re-reading those latter with
grave thoughtfulness and many pauses.
These she replied to first and at full length,
and afterwards, in a few courteously-worded
lines, disposed of the whole affair of Dr.
Swepstone's proposals in a few seconds, which
note, Mary, pushing from her, left to be consigned
to the local post with the heap of
answers to the aforesaid 
impecunious lecturers upon
every conceivable subject of science, literature,
and art.

Dr. Swepstone was indignant, very indignant,
but not for long. He well knew
that no woman would be mad enough to
refuse him in so decided a manner with no
gentle suggestion of some prima facie reason
why, it was 'rout of her power" had she been
free to accept him. No, it was quite evident
she was not free ; she was a married woman
living apart from her husband  his fault,
undoubtedly ; but still that was the bare fact.
Miss Myles, assuming again her maiden
name, was a wife, and, although perfectly

blameless as regarded her husband, was not
blameless towards the Committee of the
Chippenham Collegiate School for Girls, who
would have considered a married woman
ineligible, and whom she had, therefore,
deceived.

Dr. Swepstone, having confided this explanation
to his sister, suppressed his indignation,
and gave Miss Myles, or rather the
Lady Principal of the Collegiate School, his
pity in its place. The Rev. Mr. Brereton,
however, as head of the Committee, must be
informed of it as a kind of sacred trust, to be
used or not according to his discretion. The
sold look of incredulity and disapproval
that Mr. Brereton's face exhibited when Dr.
Swepstone made the suggestion, merged into
an amused smile when Dr. Swepstone gave
some answer which led the Rector to suspect
that his knowledge was the offspring of
injured self-love, and he summed up the consideration
of the matter very shortly by
declaring that the lady herself by one glance
could shatter a thousand such cobwebs spun
of some distempered brain; an expression
never forgiven by Dr. Swepstoue. And
yet now for the second time, as the Rector

walked away without having a moment's
interview with Miss Myles, this same ugly
cobweb seemed to float like thin gossamer
threads across his mental vision in the words,
The gentleman from foreign parts is with
my mistress to-day." Was it, could it
be possible after all that the arrogant, odious
Dr. Swepstone had some shadow of truth in
the half-malicious assertions of his wounded
self-love, uttered something like nine years
ago ? And had some wretched husband,
bought off years since, now reappeared on the
scene for the purpose of making more
extortions ? This thought was a momentary
shock, whilst it dimmed the halo which, in
his conception of her character, had enveloped
the foundress of St. Mary's Guild with an
atmosphere of sanctity, as she had been for
him a strong living argument for the perfectibility
of the creature under certain limitations.
It was a momentary shock, that presently
subsided before the chivalrous sentiment
which suddenly took possession of him.

It is for me to defend her, to stand by
her firmly in her distress, to be a true
brother. I will surely shield her and protect
her from any consequences arising from an

early and ill-assorted union." He was impelled
to return at once to confront the man
who, presuming upon his title of husband,
dared to molest her, but at the very moment
that he formed this resolution the substantial
and imposing figure of Dr. Swepstone, driven
in his well-equipped Victoria, arrested ibis
intention. Whilst hats were raised in mutual
recognition, the Rector mentally brushed
away the cobwebs, flinging them, as it were,
whither they were first spun, and walked
home with a lightened heart.

In things which are agreeable, even sinners unite themselves
with the will of God ; but the saints unite themselves with the
Divine will even in things which are disagreeable and displeasing
to self-love.

Alphonsus de Ligugri.

On reaching his home, the Rector of St.
Mary's passed at once to his study and took
his seat at the writing-table, whereon were
piled some of the best theological writings of
all ages. They were there for references, to
be employed for a work on which he had
been long engaged (which indeed, he had
been preparing for years), and had written
much; as the pile of manuscripts which he
drew forth from a drawer witnessed unto.
It had lately progressed, however, very
slowly. Sometimes days, and even weeks,
would pass and not one word would be

added to it ; and at the rate of its production
the Rector, now in his forty-sixth year, would
certainly require to attain to a century of life
here below before his exhaustive volumes
could see the light. It was a strange fact
that of late years he had not written at all,
except after he had paid one of his short
visits to the Collegiate School, or after some
other occasion had been the means of bringing
him into the society of the Lady Principal
of that establishment. Still more noteworthy
is it that a great impulse was ever given to
this literary employment of his after every
musical rehearsal at the Guild, and that
anyone who could have obtained access to
the Rectory garden on those particular
nights would have seen a lamp burning in
the Rector's study until far into the small
hours. There was no one now in the
Rectors home whose loving watchfulness
would have endeavoured to restrain within
due limits that long-cherished habit of thus
encroaching upon the hours of rest. There
was no one now to comment with tender
expostulation upon those protracted vigils
which left their mark upon the face, which
met the wakening sun with sleepless lids.

although his fine frame and constitution
seemed impervious to so great a strain.

On the morrow after a night so spent
indeed, instead of weary listlessness, the
Rector seemed invaded by a fresh accession
of energy, tempered by a still more tender
sympathy than usual. The sick man whom
he would visit would realize unwittingly that
the pressure of his hand was more fervent,
and that the tones of his voice were deeper,
or, as had been said on one occasion, " that
they right thrilled through one, as if they
came direct and straight from the heart."
A sensation as of a blessing brought to him
in some mysterious way would steal over the
invalid, a glow at his chilling breast, and a
lulling of all pain. With what wistful looks
would his eyes follow the retreating figure of
his pastor when he bade him farewell ; and
then he would turn on his side to sleep with
a smile, as though a foretaste of the rest so
near at hand had been brought to him by
that benign presence.

Alongside the great sympathy of his
nature there was, moreover, a still more
dominant characteristic, in his inborn feeling
of reverence. Had he been born seventeen

centuries earlier that frame of mind alone
would have enrolled him among those
workers who could live and breathe only in
the sanctuary. In this nineteenth century
world, however, in which he found himself,
a contemplative life was not in the path of
his duties. The same reverence for the
Eternal which in the first centuries of the
Church might have taken him to the cell and
the ascetic life, in the requirements of the
present age bore him to an active life for
humanity. It was the same reverence, not
transmitted, but incorporated with it, as the
necessary outcome of that higher reverence.
This reverence of the Creator in the created,
this reverence of God in humanity, had kept
him unstained and free from all soil in his
passage through life. A power to himself,
as to others, it was a power ever manifest,
yet in a way so free from all that is usually
associated with a manifestation of power over
others, that no one could ever tell wherein
it lay. No more dignified presence than
that of the Hector of St. Mary's could well
be imagined, nor one in which dignity was
so perfectly free from the faintest shadow of
haughtiness. The most disreputable of his

parishioners received the same deep courtesy
that he would have given to a prince, and
cowered sometimes before the greeting as
with sudden shame and inner conviction of
his worthlessness, feeling, as it were, some
fragmentary sense of a divine presence in
the world, whilst that deep-toned voice rung
in his ears.

Mr. Brereton was not given to Biblical
quotations, and not often was the name of
the Blessed One upon his lips. There was
a tale current at Chippenham how that the
Rector one day upon suddenly meeting the
most notorious reprobate of the place and
stopping to greet him, the graceless blasphemer,
out of mere habit, gave vent to a
careless oath and invoked the Holiest. No
apparent anger, no flashing of the eye sternly
denounced the offender. *' Blessed be His
Holy Name for ever and ever ! " said the
Rector, and raised his hat, whereupon Dick
Watkins, prize-fighter, bully, and gamester,
under the contagion of the Good, pulled
off his cap, and dashing it to the ground said,
Amen." Did a drunkard cross his path, and
he, alas ! was but too common in Cheltenham,
the Rector did not turn aside, but would

salute him as if he were sane and in his right
mind. Some good people had expostulated
with him, therefore, and had ventured to
suggest that by so doing he was countenancing
vice, at which for sole answer the Elector
would smile. Upon such an individual as
the above, when thus overcome by his inveterate
weakness, the Eector would call the
very next day, as though he were an invalid,
and would behave to him with as much tender
solicitude as if indeed his affliction had been
involuntary, a disease, and not a sin. How
often had the small spark of the inner consciousness
within the offender been lighted
up by this silent forbearance of a superior
nature ! A sense of grateful appreciation at
this wonderful sympathy had several times
been awakened in a soul apparently dead to
every sacred influence, when not even a word
of expostulation had been uttered.

It had been remarked by some who had
the highest admiration for the man and his
devoted life, that he had no sense of humour,
and this was in some measure true, but in nowise
was this deficiency the result of austerity.
In the laughter of earth, in her joyous moods
with " laughter holding both her sides " he

VOL. II. M

joined not. Noisy exuberance of all kinds lie
was averse to, and possibly his mind had little
kinship with fun as it is generally understood;
but the mirthfulness of Nature in its simplicity
and calm serenity he was no stranger to. A
bright and tranquil soul, so at least he
appeared to be, one who saw only the deep
things of life, but whose heart's love went out
to the farthest and darkest corners of the
earth. A cultivated soul, too, who allowed
none of the good gifts which he had received
to become obsolescent from disuse and
neglect.

In his early manhood Robert Brereton had
chosen the Church as his profession, and at
about the same epoch he had also chosen his
wife. At the time of either choice perhaps
he had not felt the one or the other to be a
necessity of his life, without which it would
always be overshadowed. His deeper nature
was as yet slumbering, the clerical life came
to him from circumstances, and Marion
Crawford became his affianced bride because
he saw more of her than any other girl, and
because she was worthy of a good man's love.
But before he was ordained deacon a change
came over him and his feelings. He doubted

within himself if the married state was one
the most desirable for a Christian priest. The
longing after holiness and the perfect life
grew within him day by day, and the example
of ages, he thought, had shown this to be more
possible in the life of the celibate. And yet
he was under an engagement to be married !
Looking within at the man and his temperament,
it may be questioned whether his
attachment to Marion Crawford was ever of
the nature of love. He himself at that time
knew naught of this. The stronger impulse
being the religious one, he concluded that
divine love was of necessity the highest form
of love, and that it was only to be expected
that the lesser love  the love he felt for
Marion Crawford  should burn within him
with a fainter glow than that other which
kindled his warmest aspirations, but, such as
it was, it was that kind of earthly love which
sufficed for the majority of men. It was for
him, however, a source of many a midnight
conflict, but though his engagement was
unnecessarily protracted, no thought of cancelling
it ever obtruded itself into his mind,
nor ever did he suspect that the love he
offered to this good girl was a secondary

feeling in him. She was twenty-five, and he
thirty-two, when having been presented with
the living of St. Mary's, he was roused to the
consideration that if the marriage were any
longer delayed he would indeed be chargeable
with having behaved untimely to his virgin,
and therefore they were married. In that
home to which he took his bride how smilingly
the years passed ! His wife thanked God
every night for the husband He had given
her. No woman was so blessed as she in her
fond estimation. And the years glided on,
and two daughters were born to them, and
in the fifth year of their marriage Mary
Myles came to Chippenham as the Lady
Principal of the Collegiate School. How the
two women cemented a lasting friendship the
one with the other it needed not to relate.

Marion Brereton was at once dazzled and
charmed in her sisterly communion with a
mind so superior to her own, and yet not so
abstracted as that of her husband ; in this
association with the mind of a friend who
was able to fill up some hours of her life
which were unavoidably spent alone, when
she seemed to be ever the gainer, whilst the
sweetness of the giver removed all sensation

of inferiority. As for the Rector, be appeared
at once to acquire a new vitality out of this
bond between his wife and her new friend.
The poet's happiness in such a partnership
of affection was repeated in this sisterly
friend, his wife and himself; those "two
beloved women." The intellectual calm, the
full soul, the many gifts of that friend were
more to the priest than the beauty of person,
on which he never allowed his own mind to
dwell, and regarding which he answered
abruptly whenever his lively Marion remarked
upon it. The disciple of celibacy in
the abstract, though the husband of a fair
wife, never permitted himself to discourse on
the personal charms of women ; like Job, he
had " made a covenant with his eyes."

Into this happy home where sweet discourse
made glad many an hour of relaxation. Death
came, and the Rector, after ten years of untroubled
married life, was a widower. Now
all was changed; into this desolate house the
companion of his late wife could come no
more. Great was the assiduity of would-be
consolers when the appointed days of mourning
were accomplished, and many were the
aspirants to the task of filling up the void in

his heart. But the typical Protestant clergyman,
followed by a flock of female devotees,
with mothers' meetings, Bible classes, and
Dorcas assembling were not for the widowed
Rector of St. Mary's. The office of overseeing
these was relegated to others. The
pious ladies must carry on their good works
without his co-operation. His duties were
by the altar, in the pulpit, by the sick bed,
in the home of the penitent or the sinner.

The formation of a Guild for working girls
had long been a favourite project with Miss
Myles, and had also been the subject of many
an evening's conversation between the three
friends, when all the possibilities of the
scheme, and the necessary preliminaries to
be used in order to insure its success as a
means for bringing a more feminine development
into the class for which it was designed,
were amply discussed. Opportunities for receiving
evening instruction on various subjects
were to be elaborated and organized ; but
above everything else the cultivation of music
was to receive the greatest attention. The
capability of these girls for studying the art
practically had been abundantly proved.
The Rector was solicited to be the head as

well as the patron of the intended Guild, and
the Lady Principal of the Collegiate School,
as the Foundress, was also elected to act as
Lady President. Its name was chosen by the
Rector, who desired that it should be called
the Guild of St. Mary's, after his church, and
because the institute in which the meetings
would be held was also situated in the parish
of St. Mary's. One of the committee very
pertinently remarked that the name of the
foundress was also Mary, and that decided
it. The musical classes, for which elementary
tuition in singing was given by teachers
selected by Miss Myles, met once a week for
the practice of oratorios in the concert room
of the institute, at which times the Lady
President consented to be present, but with
closed doors. The Eector was also asked to
give to these meetings the double sanction of
his presence, both as a compliment and as a
token of respect due to the foundress, who
would otherwise be unsupported, and to this
he heartily assented. He was theoretically a
musician, and perfectly understood and appreciated
good music.

Thus for four years without a break, except
during the time when an epidemic almost

decimated the town, the Rector of St. Mary's
and the foundress of St. Mary's Guild met
once a week in the hall of the Literary
Institute. There were other meetings, but
they were so brief that they hardly amounted
to anything more than an interchange of
friendly greetings.

Mr. Brereton, outside his life of duties, had
one simple pleasure which savoured of
husbandry, namely, bee-keeping. It had
survived his boyhood, his college days, all
changes, until the time of Miss Myles's arrival
at Chippenham. It was a happy coincidence
that the new head-mistress was found to have
the intention also of keeping bees, as by herself
bringing bees into her little garden she
would avoid, maybe, a continually frustrated
longing that they would come of their own
accord to seek it. The hum of insect life
was as sweet to her ears, as has before been
remarked, as the colours of flowers, and the
forms of plants, were grateful to her eyes.
The mutual taste was the initial bond of
friendship between the Rectory and the
School-house. Here the Rector and Mary
were in the positions of teacher and pupil.
His character possessed in an eminent degree

the patience and clear insight required for
an observer in the natural sciences.

No other distraction throughout his life
had ever brought to bear upon him so many
calming influences as the study of those wise
little people. In the first days there was
much to tell, much to watch over ; and until
the hives were well established the Rector
was almost a daily visitor to the garden of
the Collegiate School. Later on, these visits
subsided to twice or thrice a week. When
the bees, by reason of the wintry season,
were not, as has been observed, the motive
for his frequent visits, there were his two
little girls, in whose studies, as their father,
he was, of course, much interested. And
thus the years sped on, and in all the time
succeeding upon her friend's death Miss
Myles had not crossed the Rectory threshold
but once, except on those official occasions
when the Committee of the Guild met in the
Rector's library for the transaction of business,
and a carriage always took Miss Myles
home, which was an effectual preventative to
any necessity for an escort.

Only once had she crossed that threshold
alone, and upon what occasion ? It was during

the time of the epidemic, when Guild and
musical meetings were suspended and half of
the well-to-do inhabitants were dispersed,
the Rector and Miss Myles, with the medical
staff, being left comparatively alone. Miss
Myles had closed the school some weeks
earlier than usual as a precautionary measure,
holidays not being far distant. The Rector
had sent his daughters to the seaside, and
urged that the mistress should withdraw also
for a time.

"And yourself?" she had asked.

I stay here with my poorer brethren'*
he had said.

And I also," was her quiet rejoinder.

His girls were in safety, and therefore,
without any misgiving, the Rector devoted
himself heart and soul to the work before
him. As the illness was diminishing, and
when all apprehensions for him personally
seemed to be unnecessary, he, however,
succumbed. The strength and fine health
that had warded off the disease at first had
become enfeebled by excessive and continuous
exertions, and all Chippenham was
convulsed to hear one morning that their
Rector had been suddenly laid prostrate.

that he was attacked by the disease in its
worst form, and that his life was in great
danger. A skilled nurse was promptly
procured and the highest medical advice
engaged, by whom it needs not to be stated.
Every day Mary inquired at the Rectory
door, and every day turned away heavy at
heart, for the daily bulletins were not encouraging
: " Delirium great, and excessive
exhaustion."

At last, after three weeks, came a more
hopeful answer. The nurse went down* to
see her herself, and reported with a smile
that there had been no delirium during the
night, that the patient had slept, and the
pulse was fuller and less quick. Was it well
considered that Miss Myles, with a throb of
grateful joy, determined to see him, if
allowed, on the following day ? The disease
was not contagious, and she had no work todo
; the school was closed, and the days were
very dreary.

With a basket of flowers and fruits, she
presented herself on the following morning
at the Eectory and laid her petition before
the nurse.

*' Yes, I think there will be no objection.

He mentioned you yesterday, and seemed
gratefully impressed upon hearing that you
were well. He is sleeping now. Come with me
softly into the room, and when he awakes he
will be refreshed and able to see you for a
few seconds. You may exchange a few
words, no more. And this is only a concession
to you, because you are so well
skilled in all that a sick-room demands ; and
you are, moreover, so valued a friend."

And Mary, standing at some distance
timidly aloof, looked upon the altered face
of her friend with compassion and dismay.
Quietly, and without any sound or rustle of
garments, she deposited her flowers in her
own tasteful way about the room ; and was
still standing with some in her hand hesitating
where to put these last when the sick
man opened his eyes.

*' Who is that?" he said, faintly, but calmly,
to the nurse, who hastened to rearrange his
pillows.

Miss Myles," she whispered, with a reassuring
smile.

Send her away  send her away ! " he
cried, excitedly. '' Go ! go ! go ! " he said,
trying in vain to raise his arms to wave her off.

The nurse made a sign ; Mary stole away
to weep outside the door. Half-an-hour
passed, when the nurse emerged.

It must not be repeated," she said. *' He
does nothing but moan and murmur, ' That
precious life ! ' "

And this was the man who, returning the
second time from the School-louse, bore
with him the maid's remark, 'the gentleman
from foreign parts is with my mistress again
to-day," and now sat down before his writing-table
and proceeded to examine the manuscripts
of his forthcoming works, the one
entitled, " The Crown of Virginity ; or,
Celibacy as an Ordinance of the Church : a
manual for those intending to present themselves
for Ordination to the Diaconate,"
which treatise had been commenced in the
years of his betrothal; and the other, " The
Heinous Sin of Second Nuptials in the
Christian Priesthood," the offspring of his
pen since his widowhood.

The Eev. Robert Brereton turned over
page after page of this latter work in an
absent manner, as though the words there
were perceived by his eyes but received no

intelligent meanings therefrom. All sense in
those manuscript sheets was in reality blotted
out by the shadow of " a gentleman from
foreign parts " which intervened between
his sight and the pages lying before him.

Not one of the group of holy women
gathered into the annals of the Church from
every age had been ever presented to his
mental vision as clad in a more snowy robe
of purity than the foundress of St. Mary's
Guild, and to think that an earthly cloud
under the substantial form of some graceless
husband was about to interpose itself before
that radiance was fraught with sorrowful
forebodings. Why should he conclude that
this unusual visitor, who made such unprecedentedly
long stays, must be a husband ?
Recognizing whence originally came this
suspicion he pushed back his papers with as
much decision as he had flung back the suggestion
of Dr. Swepstone some eight years
since, and leaving his seat by the writing-table
went to the fire and, leaning his arm on
the mantelpiece, gazed into the dancing
flames intently as if seeking through them
some solution for his doubts. From this
attitude he was aroused by the arrival of the

gentleman acting as Secretary to the Collegiate
School, who requested an audience.
Placing a chair by the fire, he drew his own
opposite the Secretary and awaited his
communication, which he seemed in no hurry
to make, but sat without speaking and somewhat
abstractedly all the while twirling
in his fingers what looked like a letter.

Perhaps you have already heard and
know that which I have come to tell you,"
said the Secretary at last, looking at the fire,
a vague and not very lucid observation, and
not certainly one which carried its own
explanation with it.

Heard what ? " said the Rector.

Then you have not heard ? " remarked the
Secretary.

No ; I have not heard."

The Rector's thoughts were quite away,
and he answered mechanically. It was, he
supposed, some question of funds and money
matters connected with the Collegiate School.
The Secretary was a slow-speaking man,
who loved to take his time ; it would come
out presently, but the Secretary most unexpectedly
and contrary to all precedent
abruptly discharged his shot forthwith.

'well, we are going to lose our headmistress."


It was not a shot ; it was a volley in its
effects, for the Rector sank back in his chair
unable to answer. Here was the dark cloud
closing round him with a swiftness quite out
of his calculations.

"Here is her letter of resignation; of
course worded in the sweetest manner, but
decisive nevertheless," and the Secretary
handed the letter to the Eector, who took it,
but held it in his hand without offering to
read it.

No reason given ? " he asked, after a
pause.

*' One that is quite conclusive in its way ;
merely that an event which she had long
contemplated as likely to occur at any time
has taken place, and that she would be
required to leave England for India in the
course of a few weeks."

The scoundrel ! '' mentally ejaculated the
Eector.

If anyone could have any power to
induce Miss Myles to reconsider this decision
it would be yourself, Rector."

"I will see her tomorrow morning; not
that I have much hope about it.

No," continued the Secretary. " I know
that she is not a lady who acts from any
light or trivial motive."

"No."

*sit has no reference to income, or that
could be soon got over."

Yes."

How laconic the Rector was ! The Secretary
had expected some warmer expressions of
regret at the great loss the school would
sustain in this projected withdrawal. The
Secretary rose.

You will see the Lady Principal early tomorrow,
and use your influence ? "

Yes, but it will be of no use."

When the door closed upon his visitor the
Rector sank back again into his chair and
covered his face with his hands.

Lost, lost to me for ever ! '' he groaned.

Half-an-hour afterwards the Rector, having
replaced all his manuscripts in the drawer
whence he had taken them, took up his hat,
which he had cast upon a chair. Summoning
his housekeeper, he said 

** I am going out for sick calls. Take no
account of dinner ; but tell Miss Margaret
that I should like her to come to me in my

VOL. II. N

study this evening after she has prepared her
lessons," and the Rector went forth with
grief at his heart to carry the sunshine of
the good tidings to the heavy-laden and the
weary.

Margaret Brereton, the eldest born, was
the counterpart of her father  a fine nature,
not buoyant and vivacious like the younger
sister Lilian, but thoroughly deep and true,
with somewhat of the repose and sunlit
depths which characterized the foundress
of St. Mary's Guild. She had not inherited
her father's intellectual capacity, but shared
with him in a minor degree

The reason firm, the temperate will,
Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill.

What a pearl of great price art thou, my
Margaret," said the father, as re-entering his
study, he found his daughter already there
awaiting his return. ''If I had had to ring
for you, child, it is just possible that I should
have declined to send for you. I am very
tired, and shall be but a sorry companion.
Nevertheless, I am glad that you have come.
Now don't ask me to talk, my dear. Go on
prattling of your own affairs  school work
and so forth  and I will be the listener," and

the Rector drew lier chair close to his and
took one of her hands in his own, and
Margaret, glancing at her father's face, saw-therein
what she had sometimes seen before,
after sick calls and death-bed visitations.

"Perhaps someone has died this afternoon ;
perhaps old Betty Gummeridge, poor old
soul ; but I won't ask," she thought, and
Margaret, in a subdued voice, recapitulated
all the events of the week in that world
which she alone knew. Necessarily  the
name of the head-mistress was often on her
lips, and frequently she asked questions to
which she got no other answer than a little
pressure of the hand which lay on the knee
of her father; or an occasional "Go on
talking," when she paused to regard him
with wistful looks, being fully convinced that
he had not heard one word of all that she
had been saying. At last the talker herself
succumbed, the broken words came out in
fragments, and her head drooped upon her
father's shoulder.

My poor little Maggie ! What a brute I
am ! " said the Rector, starting. " Go to bed,
my dear. What a shame to keep you up so
long after your usual time."

I am so sorry, dear father," said Margaret,
piteously.

"Your sweet voice bas refreshed me
greatly. Good-night, darling," said the
Rector, embracing her.

*' But you will go to bed too, will you
not?" she asked, pausing at the door.

*' Yes, Margaret, before long."

Before long." When the heart is
oppressed with any burthen, to lie down
to sleep is a vain delusion ; better to watch
and wrestle with the grief until sleep comes
of its own free will.

Mr. Brereton extinguished his lamp and
replenished his fire. He would argue out
the whole matter at once alone, and in the
quiet of night. There was now no doubt
about it  he would soon be deprived of the
light of that woman's presence, and henceforth
he must walk in darkness. This proposition
was not, however, admitted by him
without encountering stern opposition. He
was not a man to lose sight of the first
claims which the Church had to his affections
and to his life devotion ; but the conflict was
severe.

Hour after hour passed, and the last embers

of the fire were dying out when a more subtle
question obtruded itself.

'' If after all she is not married ! "

Abound of the heart followed this thought.

''If it were the will of God," lie pursued,
listening to the suggestion ; but the moment
it was entertained the same moment the
thought was flung aside as coming from the
fountain of evil.

God help me ! " murmured the Rector,
and he wept.

There was a light, scarcely audible footfall
near ; the Rector lifted his head. By the
flickering ashes he saw a glimpse of a figure
clothed in white. At any time his mind was
ready and his heart open for any seraphic
visitant.

Who art thou ? " he asked firmly.

Father," said a gentle voice, as a little
form clad in night apparel glided up to his
side, "father, who has died ?'*

And the father, clasping his daughter to
his breast, cried 

Truly, child, you are my good angel ; but
why have you done this ? "

I thought somebody had died, father,
that you cared for very much. I have seen

you look so before when people have died,
and I thought you would not grieve so for
poor old Betty Gummeridge, and so I
listened, and listened to hear you go to bed,
and at last I came to look for you."

With no thought for yourself ; no dressing
gown, no wrap, this chill, foggy night."

The Eector took from a bureau his
travelling maude with which he swathed
her round.

Now that I have made you like a mummy
I must perforce carry you or you will unroll by
yourself," and he caught her up in his arms,
notwithstanding many a loving protest, which
ended in her laying her head on his shoulder
and clinging round his neck.

Good-night, Margaret," said the Eector,
as he closed his daughter's bedroom door
after him ; " we shall both sleep soundly
after this."

My father did not tell me after all who
has died," thought Margaret, as she laid
her head upon her pillow.

In a word we should look upon all things which may happen tous
as from the hand of God. I say this that we may avoW the
delusions of many who say  If I were in a desert, if I were in a
monastery  if I were anywhere else but here  I should become a
saint. They say I should do I should do,

St. Alphonsus de Liquor.

Another light had been burning through the
small hours simultaneously with that in the
study of the Rector of St. Mary's, but in this
case the watcher was a woman, a woman to
whom had come that morning, as she herself
had said, '' the supreme joy of her life," the
realization of her hopes, the fruition of love,
for which she had calmly waited, nor
doubted ever, whilst youth, the era of love,
was year by year passing away.

The fine health and the style of beauty
possessed by Mary Myles had warded off the

withering effects of time. Of this she was
calmly conscious. A film of fretful discontent
too often spreads itself over the lives of
women, and, like aphides on flower blooms,
eats away their beauty faster than the usual
decay of time ; and not much less fatal are the
habits of luxury and indulgence to which so
many are pledged. At thirty-six Mary
Myles was still very beautiful. The long life
of work, loved though it had been, was now
over, and the lover for whom she had waited
was come at last. Why, then, did she sit
upon that evening following upon his coming
with clasped hands, hour after hour looking
into the fire with an aspect as if she were
revolving thoughts as grave as they were
deep ? Hers was now a face with whose
gravity was also blended a touch of pathetic
sadness. jN"o such cloud had hung over that
broad brow since the agonizing night in
which, overcome by passion, she had cried
aloud in her anguish, " They have taken
away my love, and where shall I find him
again ? " In that dark hour she had lifted up
her soul to the Eternal and made a compact
with herself evermore to abide in peace.
Daughter, give me your heart," had been

an appeal to her from the Infinite, as it has
been for centuries to the seekers after
spiritual life.

Was it after all a rending of an idealistic
vision, this return of her lover, this husband
of her youth as she always fondly held him to
be ? She, who above all would rather have
been a Beatrice than any living wife, however
happy, could she not recognize in him
the Dante of her aspirations ? Where was
the promise of his youth ? Was she after
all to be the victim of moods and tempers 
she who was conscious of a growth in herself
? She had thought out after her own
fashioning how the glowing, ardent youth, so
full of poetry, must have developed into something
grander and nobler still, more calculated
to command her adoration than the
beardless boy to whom she had dedicated her
life ? Was it all an illusion ? Did she not
recognize in this prematurely aged man the
attributes which had won her ? Was this
suspicious, arbitrary, irritable, and restless
lover the Herbert Langridge who had
thought of her as the hamadryad of the
chestnuts?

These, in sober truth, were the thoughts

that took away all sleep from her eyes on
that night after their first meeting.

Unbidden images of the many worthy men
who had sought in vain to win her affections
passed before her; she could not help it 
memories like dreams come without solicitation.
She had withheld her heart for the
best one ; she " must needs love only the
best," and she had woven round Herbert
Langridge the many rayed garment of her
fancies until he had seemed, indeed, the very
best the best in his youthful promise  how
far the best in his manhood's prime ! And he
was here, and her heart had been more
troubled, and more tears had come to her
eyes in their first interview than she had been
acquainted with for years. She, who had
thought that she had overcome all weak
emotions, had again succumbed to their
influence, had been betrayed into anger, into
something very like peevish impatience. All
this she reviewed, but she did not swerve from
her fealty to him whom she had for ten years
recognized as her husband. Hers was a
truly loyal soul, but a deep pity took the
place of admiration, and strange it was
that the large compassion and scheme of

compensation that Herbert Langridge had
nursed and brought over with him from
India to be generously poured out at the feet
and for the service of the wasted idol of his
youth, was by a singular reversion to be
dedicated to him by her for whom it was
intended. His early disappointment, if it had
not permanently changed his nature, had
obscured its finer quality. This deterioration,
she thought, would not have occurred had
she been by his side. The remainder of her
life was then at all cost due to him who hard
suffered so great a loss indirectly through
herself.

But warped though he was from a too
exclusive dictation of every faculty of mind
and spirit to means for an end, the Herbert
Langridge of ten years since was not utterly
wrecked in his pursuit of honours and wealth.
His devotion to the memory of one woman
alone, his persistent constancy, his purity of
life were enough in themselves to redeem any
man, and all these he had kept as a sacred
deposit. What then was to hinder him from
calling back to himself again the finer essences
of being that had faded out of sight in uncongenial
surroundings? He reflected with

a shudder upon what might be the possibility
from future daily contact with imperiousness
and restlessness upon the impressible nature
of the woman who loved him. In the silent
hours of communing with himself that very
evening he asked what right he had to dictate
to one who held within herself such evidence
of right-judging and right-doing ? Was it
not unbounded arrogance to ask concessions
to his pride from such a woman ? Could he
not confidently leave to her the maintenance
of her own dignity ? " It is my own
ignorance, my Anglo-Indian prejudices that
alone blind me to the true nobility of her
position here." It was, therefore, in a mood
much less captious and resentful towards
*' girls' Collegiate schools " and guilds, and
all the world in which his future wife had
been dwelling so long, that Herbert sought
her the next day, and in a few manly words
left to her all future arrangements preliminary
to their departure for India ; and
her lamp was not burning that night when
St. Mary's chimes, in slow and measured
cadence, told that another day was near.

Millicent, when Mr. Brereton calls show
him into my private room."

Such a command was another surprise to
Millicent, and almost as great a one as the
long visits of the " gentleman from foreign
parts" on the two preceding days. No
gentleman had entered this sanctuary during
her ministrations, not even the mysterious
gentleman from foreign parts," whose name
she persisted to ignore to herself, although
compelled to repeat it in its integrity when
announcing him to her mistress.

Mr. Brereton felt immediately that something
was going to be revealed, when he was
ushered into Miss Myles's holy of holies, the
very perfection of simplicity and elegance,
yet not destitute of the more enjoyable
quality of cosiness.

I am quite free this afternoon, and T
hope, Mr. Brereton, that you will be able to
give me a little more of your valuable time
than usual. I have great need of your
counsel."

It was coming then ; but nevertheless she
did not look troubled  did not look as if she
were under the thumb of a scoundrel of a
husband ! As Mary had taken the initiative,
he sat down in the chair placed for him
opposite to her, and waited ; but Mary, full

of regrets at leaving Chippenham and all the
associations that bound her to the place, felt
herself restrained at the very onset, and also
remained silent. The Rector noticed her embarrassment,
and said gently 

Is it in reference to your late communication
to our Committee, which was placed
in my hands last night by the Secretary,
dear Miss Myles, upon which you wish to
consult me ? "

"Hardly that, Mr. Breton, as that
admits of no reconsideration."

The Rector looked at her again ; no, she
was not so self-possessed as usual.

'' You have only to command me," he
said, earnestly ; " if my poor services can be
of the slightest use to you  if you are  that
is to say  in any difficulty."

The difficulty is not with myself, save
that, as you may imagine, it gives me no
small pain to be obliged to leave Cheltenham
 to leave you."

Then I infer the obligation to go, as
you conceive it to be, is not of your own
seeking ? "

'' Oh ! I must not say that  I cannot say
that," she replied, with more animation. " It

is no less a joy than a duty which takes me
hence."

These scoundrels are always adored by
the best of women," said the Rector to himself.


*' But there are very few joys quite unmixed
with pain," she continued.

Is your only pain now. Miss Myles, in
the fact that you are going to leave us ?
How am I to help you in that ? What
counsel can I give you here ? That will be
shared by all in Chippenham. This unexpected
resignation is nothing less than a
blow to the whole community. I speak not
of myself ; God forbid that I should express
any selfish considerations on this matter. T
speak for the whole of Chippenham."

It seems almost a treason to say that I
am sorry, or else I, too, would say that I am
very, very sorry."

Mr. Brereton looked full at her, there was
something so sympathetic in that look that
she felt compelled to speak out.

You see, dear Mr. Brereton, that we
have waited so long  we have not even met
for ten years," she said, almost apologetically.


Mr. Brereton made a slight gesture of
impatience.

Something is due," rejoined Miss Miles,
in a firmer tone, as she noticed this movement,
" to my future husband for his almost
unparalleled constancy ; hence it is, that I
feel compelled to consult his convenience
alone, and to leave my post at a shorter
notice than courtesy would otherwise demand,
but Mr. Langridge has to leave England
to return to India in the beginning of
January."

The unconnected and tortuous manner in
which Miss Myles, in a style so unusual to
her, had hitherto evaded a direct explanation
of her motives for leaving, had been misconstrued
by Mr. Brereton into a confirmation
of his suspicions, but he had followed
her last words with attention, and now saw
the whole skein unravelled. She had not
come to Chippenham in the double character
of wife and spinster, and she was clear from
all such imputations. The whole tale of
patient constancy and devotion, which that
one sentence revealed, was one sure to commend
itself to the admiration of such a man
as the Rector of St. Mary's. He did not

Speak ; he was gathering up all the links of
the chain, and his eyes filled with tears.

"Would it not be treason to say that I
am sorry ? " she said, gently, and she laid
her hand on his.

He did not withdraw his hand, as he
would have done at any other time had her
soft palm touched his, but took her hand
and held it in both his own.

*' It would indeed be treason to say you
are sorry, my dearest friend. None of us
may say we are sorry. All who suffer frdra
your departure must rejoice in your joy.
God bless you," and he rose to go.

'' Do not leave me yet, Mr. Brereton. I have
some requests to make. I will ring for tea."

The Rector sat down.

I stay for the oratorio."

'' That is well."

And I wish to be married at St. Mary's."

'* Naturally," answered the Elector, in a
half absent manner, as if he were not addressing
himself to her.

There was again silence.

And you also desire me to perform the
ceremony, I suppose?" he said, without,
however, looking at her.

VOL. II. o

Miss Myles hesitated to give the answer
that was longing to rush from her lips.
Could Mr. Brereton have any objection, that
he manifested no kindly readiness to anticipate
her questions so as to relieve her from
embarrassment ?

*' It is rather an awkward position for meas
you see, Mr. Brereton, to settle this
matter quite by myself. I should not have
undertaken it had you not been so old and
valued a friend, and, of course, I am not a
girl, 'but the Yicar of Sunnyside, of whom
you have often heard me speak, would, I
know, perform this office gladly if you would
kindly lend him your church. Mr. Langridge
proposed him in the first instance, but then
I shall still have to ask you a favour."

Her voice faltered; the attitude of Mr.
Brereton made the having to arrange her own
marriage indeed difficult. Her thoughts at
this juncture suddenly conceived the possibility
that the Rector in his enthusiasm for a
celibate clergy had lost all sympathy for the
institution of marriage, and that perhaps he
would have preferred her own life in the
future not to have been so dedicated. A
slight flush therefore overspread her countenance,

as finding that she was not going to be
helped, she added 

I should have to ask sou to give me
away."

I could not give you away ; no, I could
not give you away," said the Rector, with
abrupt energy ; " that I would not do."

'* Mr. Langridge left all the arrangements
to me ; but I think when I was so ready to
take them upon myself I made a great
mistake. I thought all would have been sp
very easy."

Your tea is very good, Miss Myles ; I
will take another cup," said the Rector.

Mary poured him one out and handed it to
him.

The Rector stirred his tea and looked at it
thoughtfully, as though that was engrossing
his every consideration at that epoch, but
after awhile he put it back on to the table,
and, pushing it away from him, he raised
his head, and, with rather a forced smile,
said  

"Do you not think now yourself. Miss
Myles, that it would have a very curious
appearance for me to give you away in my
own church ? "

"Of course it would, Mr. Brereton ; so
indiscreet a suggestion would not have
emanated from me if I had not thought that
you had some objection to perform the
ceremony."

Her voice trembled.

What objection can I possibly have, dear
Missiles:"

The Rector looked full at her.

None that I know of," said Mary, and
tears rose to her eyes.

Any priest would think it an honour.
Then why not I ? "

*' It is myself who will be honoured, as I
have always been, by your friendship, Mr.
Brereton."

Mary here fairly broke down, but she
turned aside and succeeded in checking the
rising sob.

The Rector passed one hand across his
brow.

"Is the room too hot for you, Mr. Bretton
? Shall I open the door ? The fire is
somewhat large."

No, thank you ; we are always used to
large fires here in the north. I have been
working rather hard lately, and have been

sitting up at night a little longer than usual,
so have just got a slight headache. It is
nothing. Your tea is doing it good," and
he drew the teacup nearer to him again.

There is a great deal of sickness about,
is there not, Mr. Brereton ? "

Yes, especially among the old folk,"
said the Eector, as he emptied his cup.
Had I not better call upon Mr. Langridge
and talk it over with him 'f" At what hotel is
he staying ? Or, if he would call upon nee,
would it not be better still ? " said Mr.
Brereton, as he again rose to go.

Herbert Langridge left Chippenham last
night, and will not be able to come down
again until a day or so before  "

Indeed ! then you are to be defrauded of
your courtship after all ? '' cried the Hector,
with a sudden attempt at sprightliness. " I
really did not understand." He paused a
moment as he took up his hat, then, turning
round, he said, '' I will see you again in
reference to this; but when you write to
Mr. Langridge kindly tell him that I expect
that he will make my house his home upon
that occasion  and also your friend Mr.
Ashcroft. It will give me the greatest

satisfaction if Mrs. Ashcroft will also accompany
the Yicar. Yours will be, I presume,
what is termed a quiet wedding, but a lady
will be necessary to preside, be the guests
few or many, for, in a few words, I wish to
convey to you that which I have at heart,
which is, that your wedding be kept at the
Rectory, and my two dear girls be your bridesmaids.
You see I am speaking now very
peremptorily, like an elder brother. It will
relieve you and simplify everything if I take
all this arrangement upon myself, and so I
ask you, in the light of the aforesaid elder
brother, to leave it all to me. You can trust
me, I think, not to do anything at variance
with your own code as regards taste, which,
I believe, is almost identical with my own."

'' My kind, best friend ! " cried Mary, and
she held out both her hands to him.

As they stood there in the fire-glow, who
would not have said that they were a couple
who were designed by Nature for each other ?
The fitness of age, their moral attributes and
intellectual gifts, and the exceptionally fine
personal appearance of them both would have
almost justified the old most-mistaken saying
that marriages are made in heaven.

Mr. Brereton gazed long and fixedly upon
the face of the woman turned to him with
such a beaming look of grateful appreciation,
and whose hands were resting in his own.

An ante-nuptial benediction," he said,
*' rests upon you both for your mutual constancy
and truth  the benediction of the
Church it will be my privilege to bestow.
God bless you, dear Miss Myles." He raised
one of the hands she had resisted to him and
slightly touched it with his lips, '* God bless
you ! "

Mary would not trust herself to speak, but
accompanied him to the door. A cold blast
blew on them both.

Pray go back. Miss Myles, the wind is
chill and piercing," and he shuddered.

As he heard the door close behind him he
drew a long breath. " Thank God it is
over, and I have not betrayed myself. My
path now lies straight before me," and with a
firm step he strode down the dark road
homewards.

S. Waddington.

Although Mrs. Hazelhurst lead felt greatly
relieved after her nephew had called upon
her ; during which interview lie had acquainted
her that his future bride and himself,
after mature deliberation, had arrived at the
decision that it would on all accounts be
more befitting that their marriage should
take place at Chippenham, where Miss Myles
had for so long had so many interests'; yet
she was not without sharing a most lively
curiosity with Helen to know the details of
an event which she still secretly very much
regretted.

Helen had been much disappointed at the
change of plans. She had looked forward
with great pleasure to the prospect of seeing
her beloved friend, for such she always faithfully,
and without any swerving, deemed the
lady who had won her affections whilst she
was superintending her studies. She had in
no way been influenced by her mother's
depreciatory observations in regard to the
change in that lady's personal appearance.
Mrs. Hazelhurst and Helen had both driven
to Dr. Grantham's funeral, and at some
distance had both seen Miss Myles, but as
she was closely veiled it was quite obvious to
Helen that her mother could not have been
able to make very critical or trustworthy
investigations, and that the expressions of
"careworn," "faded," "precise," "middle-aged
woman " which frequently fell from
Mrs. Hazelhurst's lips were more the offspring
of her foregone conclusions than the
results of her own vision. Helen really
knew Mary better than her mother, and had
often suspected that her very severe style of
dress was really assumed as a disguise or
veil for the rare beauty which she was herself
conscious of possessing.

Mrs. Hazelhurst had seen a shade or two
more of sadness in Helen's face after this
alteration of plans ; but Helen had not been
looking well lately. She was silent, pale,
and depressed; the bright smiles and glowing
cheeks, which were the chief characteristics
of her loveliness, were gone. Of
her it might almost have been said that she
was 'faded."

'* No wonder," said Mrs. Hazelhurst to
herself, angrily, " to be thrown over after
all  a girl who has evidently refused all
offers on his account ; and then he comes
back and is as besotted as ever."

If the days of witchcraft had not long
been past and gone, Mrs. Hazelhurst would
quite readily have fallen a victim to a dominant
superstition, and have declared that
sorcery must be at the bottom of such a
delusion ; and who can tell whither such a
belief might not have led her, with the pale
cheeks of her daughter always before her,
and her heart-rooted conviction that her
nephew was being sacrificed ;  for persecutors
have not been necessarily'' more cruel
than other people. They have merely been
possessed of a narrower mental vision, and

have, therefore, not been able to arrive at
any other conclusions than those which were
determined by that limited range, blundering
in their judgments because they took not
fast hold of the raiment of Love as their
guide.

Surely all persecution is but the intensifying
our opinions into actions, and it may
even be possible that the most earnest souls
are therefrom in the more imminent danger
of succumbing to the temptation of employing
force as an auxiliary, when mild persuasion
fails.

Mrs. Hazelhurst, however, could only
wonder at Herbert's delusion without being
able to solve it by any other method than by
the usual belief so very widely spread among
men and women, that there is no accounting
for any absurdity into which a man may not
fall in love matters. Feeling: thus, Mrs.
Hazelhurst had not acceded to the proposition
of the Yicar s wife that Helen should goto
the wedding of her former governess
under the escort of herself and husband.
Helen, indeed, although much wishing it, had
not urged it strongly. She was in all things
a good and obedient daughter, and never

asserted herself, or possibly Mrs. Hazelhurst
would not have withheld her consent. So,
instead of aunt or cousin being present at
the marriage of Herbert with Miss Myles,
they only sent presents and congratulations
through Mrs. Ashcroft. The Yicar had
posted a copy of The Chippenham Gazette to
Mrs. Hazelhurst, which she had read in
silence ; nor had she offered it to Helen, but
laid it on one side in such a manner that her
daughter, supposing that her mother did not
care for her to see it, did not put out her
hand to take it for herself.

How pale the dear girl is looking this
morning," thought the mother ; " I wish
Herbert had not called at all ; she was well
enough before that."

But Mrs. Hazelhurst quite overlooked the
fact that another frequent visitor at her
house for the last two or three years was no
longer able to be there so often, and that
since Reginald Ashcroft had been made the
Eector of Moreton, which was quite a hundred
miles distant from Simnyside, it was no
more possible for him to give to Mrs. Hazel-hurst
and her daughter the benefit of his
ever-cheery society as before.

Mrs. Hazelhurst had remarked that morning
what a loss it was to them all that Reginald
was so far off, adding 

When he was Curate at Glastonbury we
saw so much of him."

Yes," said Helen, coldly, and looked in
an absent way through the window, but as
Mrs. Ashcroft was at that moment announced
she immediately brightened up,
and ran forward almost gaily to welcome her.

Mrs. Ashcroft was not of an enthusiastic
nature, nor much gifted with eloquence, but
she was natural, and devoid of all sentiment
and affectation. The real admiration and.
sincere affection which she had always entertained
for Miss Myles being no longer
restrained in its expression before Mrs Hazel-hurst
(the lovers being now man and wife
and everything irrevocably settled as far as
regarded them), she felt herself at liberty to
say exactly what she thought, and consequently
she launched forth almost volubly into
encomiums on the bride, and on the Rector
of St. Mary's and his girls ; and also gave an
animated and almost vivid description of the
breakfast at the Rectory. Mrs. Ashcroft
seldom left home ; it was, therefore, quite a

new experience to be the lady paramount at
such a house as Mr. Brereton's, and upon
such an occasion.

Helen listened with rapt attention. She
broke in with at last 

'' Oh, dear ! I must never repeat the offensive
word Polly any more. Herbert did not
like it years ago, I remember ; but it is so
difficult to call my once dear Polly, Mrs Langridge."


Very," said Mrs. Hazelhurst, drily.

I suppose there were some speeches,"
said Helen, colouring, it would appear, inconsequence
of her mother's monosyllable.

Only Mr. Ashcroft made anything that
was worthy to be called a speech. Mr.
Brereton's was more like a sermon or a blessing.
It certainly was not a speech. But
you know how very witty and clever Mr.
Ashcroft is," said the admiring wife, "and
what good things he can say when required""

Can you remember any of the good
things?" asked Helen, smiling.

Well, I have cause to remember one,
because the lady who sat next to me was a
little deaf, and did not see the point. You
know how apt Mr. Ashcroft is in his quotations,

and of course you know, also, how
very beautiful he always thought our friend.
He once heard how much she had been
admired down at Girton, and how crazy the
undergraduates were about her ; or, as Mr.
Ashcroft had said, * She made sad havoc
with them all round.' So all this knowledge
of Miss Myles's many conquests was brought
by my husband into his speech very cleverly,
without seeming, you know, dear Mrs. Hazel-hurst,
as if it had been at all premeditated.
I thought it was so well done when he sard,
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his
ten thousands.' I don't know whether everyone
saw the point. The Rector looked
abstracted, and as far away as if he had been
at the gate of Heaven, and gazed at my husband
in the most lost kind of manner. I
think your nephew understood it, for he
looked steadily with a half-smile at his bride,
but she was immovably composed, as if she,
too, was leaning over ' the golden bar,' as her
own favourite poem says. But the poor
lady near me, the wife of the Treasurer of the
Marigold Guild, who had only heard about
some ' thousands ' of ' slain,' leant forward tome
and asked in a half whisper if I could tell

her where the great battle had been. Was it
not good ?" and Mrs. Ashcroft's beaming face
was still more illumined than before at the
recollections of her husband's opportune wit.

Mrs. Hazel hurst, however, did not smile.
What was all this talk about conquests and
admiration ? In her mind she was " careworn
" and " faded." She had asseverated
these words so often to herself that she
firmly believed them. How weak all these
people were ! As to Mr. Ashcroft, she had
had too often experience of the inaptitude of
his wit, and his similes, and his quotations
to heed them now as being at all worth anything
; and at this juncture, being in a more
severe mood than usual, she highly deprecated
his employment of Biblical quotations,
however metaphorically used, upon such an
occasion as the much-to-be-deplored marriage
of her nephew to her ex-governess, and
therefore looked very grave and was silent.

'' I suppose they will not leave England
without calling ? " she asked, coldly.

No, dear Mrs. Hazelhurst, they will be
here in a few days. It is like Mrs. Langridge
that their first visit will be to the grave
of her husband's mother, to place wreaths

there together, then they will come on here ;
but Mr. Ashcroft and myself shall make a
point of going down to Southampton a few
days before they sail in order to see them off."

You have not said anything about
Herbert himself," said Mrs. Hazelhurst.
Did he look happier ? It grieved me to see
him, poor fellow''

'' He does not need anyone's pity," replied
Mrs. Ashcroft, drawing herself up ;
my husband will tell you all about it, for
he says the grandest thing he ever saw was
the way the two men, Mr. Langridge, and
Mr. Brereton the Eector, both fine-looking
men, stood with their hands clasped in each
other's ; each of them, as far as I can understand,
thanking and blessing the other, with
tears in their eyes ; the one for having been
her protector in the past, the other in that he
had been chosen by Providence as her guardian
in the future, ' the great gift of God,'
I think those were the words, or something:
like them, but Mr. Ashcroft will tell you."

Oh, it's of no consequence," said sirs.
Hazelhurst, in a low voice.

A week later, having knelt together at the
VOL. n. p

mother s grave, the husband and wife drove
over to Sunnyside. Leaving the carriage to
wait at the entrance of the woody glades
skirting the grounds, Herbert lifted his wife
over the ha-ha fence, which he had himself
about ten years before sprung over, gaily
whistling.

Come, Mary, we must go to the shrine
of my hamadryad. Albeit 'tis now a deserted
shrine, and the poor lone tree is no longer
her home or her prison. I verily believe,"
he said, half smiling, half serious, *' that you
were a hamadryad in some former state of
existence. I ain quite sure of it ; perhaps
after all I released you. Who but a hama-dryad
or some other sylvan goddess ever
possessed two such  "

Hush ! " was the laughing answer, and
a gloved hand was laid upon his lips.

'* My fair hamadryad," he cried, when free
speech was restored, '* had always a little of
the prude in her."

She is certainly a very elegant woman.
I have no hesitation in saying that," was
Mrs. Hazelhurst's remark to Helen after her
nephew and his wife had left ; kind Mrs.

Hazelhurst felt her heart relieved from a
burden which had long oppressed it. She
had sometimes argued with herself that
perhaps she was unjust in her estimate of
Miss Myles. She was therefore more content
in her innermost soul after this little
tribute of appreciation. She even took
pleasure in conversing with her daughter
upon the exquisite taste her niece (for she
actually brought herself to speak openly of
such a relationship) had in dress, but traditional
cause of her cheerfulness was due
to her lately awakened perception, so welcome
to her maternal eyes, that Helen was
certainly in no wise jealous of the preference
given by her cousin to the lady who was
now his wife.

Why was it, then, that Helen soon retired
to her own room, and throwing herself on a
couch, buried her face in the cushions and
wept bitterly ? She, who had so often been
eloquent on the debated subject of Miss
Myles's beauty with her mother, had been
silent on this occasion, whilst her mother
was recapitulating the claims of her newly-found
niece to the admiration of everybody.
This contrariety has been noticed before.

Yes, she is beautiful, strangely beautiful,"
said Helen, after the tears had fallen long
and silently. " She is like those women one
reads of sometimes who through a long life,
have always subjugated men ; and she is
pure, therefore has she the greater power.
What hope that the hold once obtained by
her over any man's affections could ever be
relaxed ! It is like an old world story. Ten
years 1 A lifetime, almost, to some, and no
change  a love that will go on for ever !
Who would not exult at being loved with a
love so broad and deep ? But such a love is
not for me ! And my mother could think
that I have thought upon Herbert all these
years ; that he won my affections when I
was but a child, and has no perception of
the truth ! How much better, so that I am
able to mask the reality to her, lest in her
affectionate anxiety she might betray me.
The marigold which I sent to my cousin so
long ago, the marigold out of her garden
which he had forgotten in his grief at martin
jr, he has them still he told me but an
hour since. A dead flower more prized by
one man than a whole heart's love is cared
for by another ! For fourteen years ! for

fourteen years ! " she sighed, after a pause,
*' and she loved him well, how well is
perhaps alone known to me, until Herbert
came, but he but he is faithful even now,
and loves her still. Who can wonder at it ?
Who would pause to choose between her and
me  although I am ten years younger,
and am an heiress, as they call me, forsooth,
as well ! " A scornful curl of the lip showed
at what rate the good girl valued the wealth
with which she was accredited.

Mrs. Hazelhurst, full of generous impulses,
and anxious to unbosom herself by openly
expressing them, drove out with Helen the
day following upon this, to make sundry
calls, which she said had been too long unrepaid,
but really to talk over the singular
and unparalleled constancy of her nephew.

She had been reticent enough heretofore,
and " the romantic tale " upon which she now
dilated had never been heard of from her,
whilst there was any chance of its being
relegated to the region of myths.

Now, however, that her nephew's wife was
an acknowledged member of her family, it
behoved her, as she thought, to make the

fact as widely known as possible. Wherever
they went that afternoon Helen was
doomed to hear the same praises and the
same descriptions ; and the honest girl
wondered both at her mother and at herself.
She marvelled at Mrs. Hazelhurst's sudden
conversion and change of language, for
whereas for many weeks  ever since Herbert
Lanofridoe had first called and asserted that
his determination and his feelings regarding
the former object of his affections were quite
unchanged  Helen had heard with an undescribable
sense of weariness the unmeasured
scorn of her mother towards her
nephew and the object of his choice ; and
she was also now surprised at herself,
because she was now almost equally as
weary at hearing their praises. A feeling
of shame oppressed her as she became
conscious of a certain bitterness of heart 
a void  whilst so many encomiums were
showered upon another.

We will just call in for a few minutes at
the Ashcrofts, love. They will be glad to
hear about Herbert and his wife."

You forget, dearest mother, that it was

their intention to call at the Vicarage after
leaving here ? "

Ah, yes, but it had quite slipped my
memory ; nevertheless, we will drive round
there. We will not stay. We may hear
something about Reginald. You know that
he is also a great favourite of mine ; but how
pale you look, child ! Perhaps it has already
been too much for you ; if so, we will return
immediately."

Oh, no, mother ! I always like to goto
the Vicarage."

But the weary look came again over her
face at hearing the same recital.

"Am I getting envious?" she asked,
between her closed teeth.

Only think of ten years' constancy on a
man's side ! " reiterated Mrs. Hazelhurst ; " it
is, I should think, quite unparalleled, as I am
often saying to myself."

' It is not so much as fourteen years," said
Helen, gloomily.

'have you ever heard of anyone whose
constancy has lasted fourteen years, Helen ? "
asked Mrs. Ashcroft.

Yes," answered Helen, laconically.

*why, who is that, love?" said Mrs.
Hazelhurst, with eyebrows raised and ia
sheer amazement, lifting her eye-glass as she
turned to her daughter.

But Helen's eyes were obstinately cast
down and her lips compressed, and that washer
only answer.

Helen is not well ; she is out of health,
dear Mrs. Hazelhurst," whispered Mrs. Ashcroft
at parting. " Let her go down to
Southampton with us the day after tomorrow."


And Mrs. Hazelhurst, after a long and
searching look at her daughter, nodded a
smiling assent.

And ther saide ones a clerk. What is better than sold ?
Jasper. And what is better than Jasper ? Wisdom. And what
is better than wisdom ? A good woman. And what is better
than a good woman ? Nothing.

Chaucer.

Man is a talking animal ; and what is better
than good talk ?  who would not go far to
find it ? In this respect it may be assumed
that men have a greater advantage than
women, for from their college to their club
days the facilities for conversation are frequent.
Facilities for conversation ; but how
rare amidst all this wealth of opportunity is
really good talk met with ! To have good talk
there must be good talkers. And are all
these cantered hurling their light shafts at
random  these reproduces of the railleries of
the press  talkers at all ? This love of raillery

which is so rampant amongst young men
especially, strangles conversation. The very
pretence at excess of life visible in all this
punning and counterfeiting of sprightliness,
this retailing of grotesque stories, imposes
silence upon him who has anything to say.
Not but that a good humoured raillery, with
some spice of wit accompanying, is a pleasant
adjunct in discourse when the combatants
are equally matched, but even then it is
better only to be called forth occasionally as
an auxiliary, and, like auxiliaries, generally
requires to be under the stern control of the
regular forces. For what greater bore is
there in the large family of boredom than
the man who gives himself up to habitual
raillery ?

Now Sir Henry Mason was one who had
always through life indulged in it, but as his
flights were generally as destitute of wit as
they were harmless, he was tolerated universally,
for mankind in the aggregate bears its
afflictions with tolerable equanimity, and the
usual way in which " one of Mason's " was
received was all included in the commentary
he's a good fellow." Being thoroughly
good-natured and impervious to snubbing,

he persevered in giving forfcli his sallies year
after year, and his old associates whom he
habitually met at his club heard the oft-repeated
jokes in silence, no longer even
troubling themselves to notice them except
by an occasional furtive smile exchanged,
with sometimes an imperceptible shrug.

Their forbearance was partly due to a
feeling that it was a necessity in the man
to have this kind of safety-valve, although
he had arrived at an age when raillery is less
tolerated than it is with younger men ; for it
was generally widely known that only at his
club was such delectation possible.

Sir Henry Mason was a married man, and
Lady Mason condemned the least approaches
to anything that savoured of levity. A
ponderous woman was Lady Mason, both
in mind and body, slow in speech, and slow
in gait, with a mortal antipathy to the least
approach to a joke. How the glib retailer
of stale puns, and a woman who characterized
laughter generally as the " crackling of
thorns " drifted into the married state was
a never-to-be-explained marvel. Lady Mason
rejoiced in wearing continually the heavy
chains of a dull decorum which never relaxed.

It was always to her an inward source of
extreme satisfaction, when she remembered
how effectually she had at an early stage of
their married life corrected those weaknesses
of her husband, who never now committed
himself to foolish jesting. She reflected with
pride upon the judgment which she had used
in weeding out from their visiting list all those
friends of his bachelorhood who where given
to sing comic songs, or repeat sayings from
the last Punch.

The return to England of that old friend
who had years ago been the pole of attraction
for his rallying propensities, seemed to
awaken from their slumbering depths all the
old frivolities which Lady Mason had once
told him were unbefitting the demeanour of
a Christian gentleman. Once he asked Sir
Robert Carbury to dinner, once, and once
only.

The severe look of astonished reprobation
and scarcely suppressed indignation with
which Lady Mason fixed Sir Robert at his
first " By Jove ! " was only surpassed by the
majestic silent arraignment of her husband
by leaning back in her chair and crossing her
hands in grand resignation, as he, fortified by

Sir Robert's presence, seized the opportunity,
and gave vent to a very small witticism.
Lady Mason that same night in the privacy
of the nuptial chamber, and in a voice as
if she were reading a homily, quoted the
objurgation of Henry the Fifth to Falstaff as
applicable to their late guest 

I know thee not, old man : Fall to thy prayers ;
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester ! "

Quite innocent of the manner in which he
had been thus apostrophized. Sir Robert, the
very next time that he met his friend at the
club, came down heavily upon the table with
the offending fist, accompanied by the sonorous
" By Jove ! " as a preface to his very
decided summary upon Lady Mason. '' I
can't stand your wife. Mason ; she's more formidable
than a fifty-pounder."

So the friends met at the Anglo-Indian
Club and were unembarrassed and happy.
Sir Robert let his old friend have a free field
for his raillery, and the latter availed himself
of his friend's frankness, as it afforded
scope for his wit and inwardly chuckled over
and over again when in the grave solemnity
of his home, by recalling his clever and
sparkling hits at divers times on the subject

of cherries and cherry pies, all of which
Sir Robert took with never failing good
humour.

Two or three days after Christmas the
friends were again in the coffee-room, and
on account of that festive time which
generally draws men more to home-life
than any other season of the year it was almost
empty. They had each been reading their
favourite papers with flying commentaries
on the leaders, when Sir Henry drew one
from his pocket, a county newspaper, which
had evidently come that morning by post,
and had not been as yet looked at.

'' The CMppenham Gazette'' he said, as he
stripped off the wrapper. " That's where
your little girl of the cherry pie went to, you
know. There's a fellow whom I know down
there who sends me a paper now and then ;
but there's not much in it besides local news."

His friend was deep in a speech of one of
the members upon the situation in the East,
and did not hear or heed this remark.

*' I say, Hanbury ! " he shouted, when his
eyes had for a few moments glided carelessly
over its contents, " Hanbury ! "

Whatever is the matter, man ? " said the
Colonel, looking up from his own paper ;
"anything amiss with Lady Mason this
morning, eh ?"

Pshaw ! look here ! Read it for yourself.
First column, at the top there," and
he pushed The Ghijpjenham Gazette across the
table.

No, no, not I ; I don't want to lose my
place here. Whatever you've found that you
want me to hear, read it yourself, there's a
good fellow ! I suppose 'tis not very long.
I'll listen for five minutes good."

'' You'll listen fast enough when I begin,
I've no doubt ; but don't come in this time
with your ' By Jove,' or I shall just slip the
paper into my pocket again. Now for it :
Picturesque Wedding at Chippenham.  All
Chippenham and its adjoining were in the
highest state of excitement yesterday from
early morn till night on account of the
marriage of Miss Myles, the Lady Principal
of the Chippenham Collegiate School.

No sooner was it generally known that
this lady, who has been among us for several
years, and who has been so universally
esteemed by all classes for her goodness

and sweetness of character, as well as admired
for her beauty and her many and varied
attainments, was to be married this morning
at the Church of St. Mary's, than a large
concourse of people of both sexes and of all
ages thronged to the vicinity of the church.

'' The bridegroom's status as holding a
high position in India had somehow oozed
out, as well as the long period of his and
Miss Myles's engagement, and these topics
were discussed by the patient groups awaiting
the arrival of the bride. The dress of
the bride was a departure from that usually
adopted, and, possibly because she is not in
her first youth, the veil and wreath was
replaced by the form of bonnet called the
Princess,' and her entire costume upon so
cold and wintry a day was more pleasing to
the eye than any glistening white satin or
veil, suggestive of chilliness, would have been.
To be brief, her gown was of a rich dark blue
velvet, trimmed wich ermine, with a long
train of the same, also lined and bordered
with ermine, and the bonnet was of the same
material, with a small aigrette of diamonds
in front. She also wore around her throat a
rare necklet of diamonds, in antique setting,

which relieved the colour of the gown. A
rich, short Chantilly veil completed her
costume, the whole of which was singularly
in accordance with her style of beauty. Her
only two bridesmaids, the two daughters of
Mr. Brereton, the Rector, who officiated,
were also warmly clothed in cream-coloured
plush, turned up with blue, with hats to
correspond.

'' Miss Myles had long been the patroness,
as she was also the foundress, of a guild for
girls and young women, well known in
Chippenham as the ' Marigold Guild,' the
marigold being a favourite flower with this
lady. These girls, to the number of almost
two hundred, in their uniforms of blue serge,
with the marigold device worked with silk in
its own colour on cuffs and collar, were
ranged in a triple row on each side of the
churchyard path leading to the porch, and
upon the bride's alighting at the outer gate
received her with an adaptation of Keble's
marriage hymn, arranged expressly for the
occasion. The effect of their well-trained
voices, and the severe simplicity of the composition,
appealed strongly to the assembled
crowd, and many tears were shed by the

VOL. II. Q

sympathetic feminine portion of the bystanders,
who had very good reasons; realizing
how great would be their loss when the
graceful *Lady of the Marigold,' as she was
familiarly called by them, was abstracted from
their midst.

We must not forget to note that many of
these girls carried baskets of yellow flowers,
and as the garden marigold were not procurable,
the yellow marguerites, grown under
glass, did duty for the bride's favourite
flower, and these they cast before the happy
couple as they left the church.

'' Mr. and Mrs. Langridge will shortly
leave for India, and after a few excursions to
various friends are expected to go to Southampton,
whence they sail."

The reader paused, laid the paper down,
and looked at the Colonel with a smile, who
had, indeed, listened in silence, and without
interrupting this perusal.

I say, Hanbury, this Mr. Langridge had
some of the cherry pie, I expect, eh ? "

Be quiet. Mason, and just hand me over
the paper ; I want to look at it myself."

'' Oh, it's all there ! Don't be suspicious,
Hanbury; I'm not playing any joke upon you

now, and you've lost your chance, even at the
eleventh hour."

** Give it over, I sap, and don't be a fool,
Mason ! "

There, there, my good fellow," cried his
friend, laughing, as he pushed TheGhvpenham
Gazette across the table ; " the lawyer has won
by more than a neck this time''

Colonel Hanbury took up the paper gravely,
and half turning his back to his friend, so as
to face the fire, he very slowly and carefully,
as it seemed, went over the whole details,
often stopping to consider, and then, with a
kind of nod of affirmation, continuing his
reading. When he came to the close he
folded it up with much precision, and instead
of returning it to his friend proceeded to put
it into his own pocket.

"So you are intending to appropriate it,
are you. Colonel? Have you not fully mastered
the contents ? The cherry pie drama is concluded,
I conceive, at last."

*' Confound the cherry pie ! " said Colonel
Hanbury, gruffly.

Amen, say I, if it were leathery and indigestible."


Look here, Mason, be sensible, if you

can, in the absence of your commanding
officer. But, joking apart, this must be a
wonderful woman. It wouldn't have been
much of a mistake, you see, on my part.
She must be well conserved ; they speak of
her beauty as something remarkable."

'Tis no use bemoaning spilt milk, my
friend ; the astute lawyer has won."

An ill-conditioned fellow ! " grunted out
Sir Robert; ''I should think he'd be as sour
as verjuice to live with''

Why, what the deuce can you know about
him ? "

"What can I know ? Why, only just this
much : that I did not find him a very lively or
companionable fellow-traveller. Why, you've
seen him. Mason ; don't you remember the
fellow who bowed to me that morning  the
first morning we met, you know  in this
very room ? I told you then he came over
with me. By Jove ! "

"A handsome, striking-looking man, if I
remember aright," said Sir Henry, maliciously,
" and in the prime of life."

Oh, I've nothing to say against his looks,
nor him in the abstract, except that he seems
to have a disagreeable temper of his own.

He's thought a great deal of over there, an
indefatigable servant, and all that kind of
thing  a rising man  perhaps I ought to say
a risen man, because he's got to the top at
railway speed, so to speak, but I found him
as a fellow-passenger silent and unsociable.'

"He was in love, you see, Colonel."

Nonsense ; a man can't be in love for ten
years straight off."

Whew ! I fancied a certain elderly Colonel
had been wearing the willow for double that
time."

I look like it, don't I ? " replied the Colonel,
jumping up, and, drawing back his head, he
gave his grey moustache a twirl ; " but I'll
keep this paper, if you don't mind. It's
rather amusing to me to see how this has all
come round. I never thought I should hear
anything of that woman again, and here it's
just like the last act of a play."

As I just said, ' a cherry pie drama,' Hanbury."


What do you say, Mason, to running
down to Southampton with me for a few days ?
I've just a little curiosity to see what kind of
woman the curly-haired girl has turned into."

Oh, I could not go, my dear Colonel"

Could not get permission, I suppose,
from your commanding officer, eh ? Well,
thank God I'm not in that case. I own no
superior officer, I'm glad to say," and slapping
his friend on the shoulder he laughed
heartily, and bade him good-morning.

Considered week, how that the harde soon

Chaucer.

When you have finished your letter, Mary,
we will go forth into the sunshine. After
the late dull skies it is really life-giving to
look out on such a morning as this. To
whom are you writing so lengthy an epistle ? "

To Margaret Brereton. I promised her
father that I would be a frequent correspondent
with her. He is thinking of removing
her from school and superintending her
studies himself."

I see your counsel in that  it will be a
good thing for them both," answered Herbert,

reflectively, as he gazed from the window
of their hotel on to the sparkling ripples of
Southampton Water. '' Both father and
daughter are  "

He stopped abruptly, leaving his sentence
unfinished, and, going up to the writing table,
laid a gentle hand on his wife's shoulder.

When do you think the Ashcrofts will be
down, Mary ? "

'perhaps to-day, for we have now only
three days before us, Herbert."

'' I should have liked to see Reginald before
leaving. He was an old chum of mine in
childhood, when I stayed at Sunny side with
my aunt, but I suppose he had reasons of
his own for not coming to our wedding."

His wife made no remark upon this observation,
but said, parenthetically 

I think that we left nothing undone, the
omission of which would have caused us after
regret. I am so glad that we went together
and laid flowers on dear Dr. Grantham's
grave. That was your thought," and Mary
looked into his face with a grateful smile.

"Yes, I am very glad. But we have
missed Reginald, and besides being my playfellow
he was also your pupil."

Mary looked back again upon the letter
she was folding.

The '' astute lawyer," sitting down by her
side, took up the hand next to him, and,
kissing it, said, softly 

Was that poor fellow in for it too ? Was
it he who called you ' his Amy ? ' "

Her eyes were raised immediately, and
steadily confronted the searching bat not unloving
glance of the husband.

My pupil call me ' his Amy ! ' " she said.
I have never been called ' Amy ' except by
one  it was merely a pet-name."

'' So, I suppose, the synonym of ' my
glorious girl.' Now, tell me, who was that
privileged one who dared to write thus to
my hamadryad ?  a boy's flight, evidently."

Herbert, as he said these words, touched
the hand which he firmly held with his lips.
His wife, whose eyelids had never drooped
before his gaze, answered quietly and with a
half-amused smile 

Those words, dear Herbert, seem to have
burnt themselves into your brain as deeply
as they are imbedded in my own heart. They
are very sweet words to me. You quoted
them once before, quite unconscious of what

you were saying. They are from a letter of
my mother's which I always keep in ray
Rossetti, a gift from her accompanying it."

< Why, Mary, I am a convicted villain !
Can you forgive me ? "

I am your Amy. You have made those
loved words your own," she cried.

Mrs. Langridge was just drawing on her
gloves when she observed, carelessly 

This morning appears to exercise a potent
charm over that military-looking man on the
esplanade below. He has been on duty therefor
at least two hours  honos before I began
my letter. I think I observed him before
we began our breakfast. He, too, must be
revelling in this unaccustomed sunshine."

Mr. Langridge took up his glass. After a
long survey he said, as he laid it down 

*' He has the contour and look of one of
my fellow-passengers in the Guatemala. I am
very much surprised to see him here. He
cannot, however, be intending to return to
India, as he was out there twenty years atone
stretch, and is now on the retired list.
I cannot think of his name just now, but if
it be he, he is a colonel's baronet, a K.C.B.,

decidedly soldierly in appearance, but very
noisy. Are you ready, darling ? "

Our friend Sir Robert Hanbury had, in
truth, with military precision, been on duty
since nine o'clock. He had arrived at Southampton
the night before, and having learnt
from the list of visitors in the paper at which
hotel Mr. and Mrs. Langridge were staying
he had taken up his post of reconnoitring at
that very early hour.

She will not recognize me," he had said,
and as for her husband, he will be too much
engaged."

He saw them at once, therefore, as they
descended the steps of the hotel to cross over
to the esplanade. He gave one rapid glance
at the lady with as keen and criticizing a
look as if he had been at an inspection, and
the result, to judge from a sharp little nod as
lie walked on, was entirely satisfactory.

No shawls and tagrags of wraps hanging
about. Just what it ought to be. Women
do make themselves such guys. There's
not one in a thousand could pass muster
were I their inspector. She's all right
so far," he soliloquized, and the Colonel
strode quickly in the same direction, but

walking well ahead of the couple, with
the double view of keeping up his circulation,
and with giving himself, by reaching
the end of the esplanade quickly, an opportunity
of meeting them face to face on his
return march without there being anything
conspicuous in his proceedings.

He was in consequence some thirty or
forty yards in advance of Mr. and Mrs.
Langridge by the time they were following
on his footsteps ; and as at this hour the
esplanade was filling with strollers eager to
get their constitutional before the noontide
sun began to decline  Mary and her husband
being in close converse, they did not
observe that the subject of the few minutes'
conversation as recorded above was near
them, until, the end of the promenade being
reached, he had turned round and was resuming
less hurriedly his march back.

Yes, it is the same," said Herbert, suddenly,
" my fellow-passenger in the Guatemala
I mean, and his name has just come to me 
Colonel Hanbury !  Sir Robert Hanbury !
How oddly names that are forgotten come
back when you are least searching for them !
Yes, to be sure  Sir Robert Hanbury ! "

Colonel Banbury ! " cried his wife.

Yes, dear. Do you know anything of
him ? "

An old friend of my father's," and Mrs.
Langridge pressed her husband's arm.

The Colonel, as he came up to them,
directed his looks more to the lady than to
his fellow-traveller, upon whose arm she
hung, and it almost seemed as if he were
about to pass without recognition had not
Herbert's raised hat compelled him to a
hasty acknowledgment. Mary again pressed
her husband's arm.

If you do not mind, Herbert, I should
like to speak to Colonel Hanbury. He knew
my father and mother so well."

Before these words had hardly passed her
lips Herbert had turned, and, again raising
his hat, laid a hand upon Colonel Hanbury's
arm.

'' Pardon me, Sir Eobert, but my wife
would like to be introduced to you ; but introduction
seems almost superfluous, as she
claims you for an old acquaintance."

An angry look at first gleamed from under
his shaggy eyebrows ; but it was transient,
like all the Colonel's outbursts of fierceness.

Mrs. Langridge does me too much
honour," he said, courteously, if somewhat
coldly. " It is nevertheless true that I had
the pleasure of knowing her father  a gallant
officer  and her mother, and also Miss Myles,
but it is twenty years ago  twenty years
ago ! "

One must hardly speak of twenty years
of remembrance where a lady is concerned,"
said Herbert, smiling; and seeing that Sir
Eobert stood, nor made any attempt to advance
to Mrs. Langridge, he added, '' but
anyhow you see that you are not forgotten.
Colonel Hanbury, even with such a formidable
reminder intervening."

Not forgotten ! " ejaculated the Colonel,
sternly. " Not forgotten ! "

'how could my father's comrade and my
mother's good friend be forgotten by their
daughter. Colonel Hanbury ? " said a gentle
voice, and Mary, who had heard the raised
accents of those two words, came to his side
and held out her hand.

The Colonel took the proffered hand and
held it for some moments, while he seemed to
be gravely perusing her face, too intently, indeed,
for even Mary's composure and self-control,

for it called an unwelcome blush to her
face which gave it an added beauty, and a
touch of girlhood.

Your husband," he at last said, '' very
properly just now called me to task for my
being so strict an observer of dates. I am a
martinet on that point ; but looking at you,
Mrs. Langridge, I should forget it. Ah !
when last we met you were a little girl in
frocks and were satherino cherries. Am I
not right ? "

'' Quite right, Colonel Hanbury," and a
deeper glow overspread her brow; "but I
was not exactly a little girl in frocks."

No, no  no, no  it's not fair," said the
Colonel, and a kindly smile illumined his
rugged face as he began to shake the little
hand he held with great fervour and energy ;
*' it's not fair." But the homely and cherished
recollection was too much for him. *' I never
had any of that cherry pie after all,' he added,
and with a short, good-natured laugh and
another shake he released the hand.

'will you come to our hotel this evening
and dine with us, Colonel Hanbury, just for
the sake of old times ? Perhaps we shall be
able to give you cherry pie."

Made from bottled cherries ! oli ! The
cherry pie I lost was made from cherries fresh
off the tree, but not fresher nor brighter than
the maiden who gathered them," and again
he laughed. " But it's not fair. Forgive an
old soldier, Mrs. Langridge, and allow me to
congratulate you, and you also, Mr. Langridge;
you are a very fortunate man, sir, a
very fortunate man."

But will you promise to give us the pleasure
of your society to dinner. Sir Eobert ? "
asked Herbert, as he warmly shook the
Colonel's hand after this genial outburst.

Colonel Hanbury turned to Mrs. Langridge,
who had not as yet echoed her husband's
invitation.

Yes, do come. Colonel Hanbury ; we
shall both be so glad."

Our talk then, Mrs. Langridge, shall be
only of the home to which you are going. I
love India only second to England, and shall
be happy to add my experiences to those of
your husband if you need any commendations
of the life obtainable there by sober, earnest
folk, which may reconcile you to leaving
England."

Revelations upon revelations ! " cried
Herbert, gaily, as they resumed their walk.
Why, the Yicar seems to have been right
after all. Mary, I've not seen you blush so
vividly since the day you kissed me under the
chestnuts ! I have cause to be thankful to
my dying day that the invincible soldier did
not stop to eat your cherry pie."

'' Do you think that it would have made
any difference?" she answered, laughing.
But, Herbert, see who are coming yonder !
our dear friends, the Ashcrofts, and oh !
joy of joys ! my Helen is with them ! "

My dear girl does not look herself," said
Mary, as, having drawn her old pupil into her
own room, she was herself helping to undo
her wraps. Oh, my own Helen ! this is, indeed,
an unexpected joy ! But why so pale,
dear? Come, let us sit down and have five
minutes' quiet chat. Mrs. Ashcroft will not
be ready yet, and she knows the way to the
drawing-room."

She led her to a settee by the fire, and, as
they sat down, Mrs. Langridge again embraced
and kissed her.

VOL. II. R .

Helen'* she said, softly, as her arm
encircled her waist, " there is one thing at
my heart that I have longed to say to you,
and I am thankful that you have given me
this opportunity."

To do what ? " said her former pupil,
finding that her friend, who had paused, was
regarding her with wistful looks. " What
do you wish to say to me ? "

'* I have reason to believe, from some
observations dropped by Mrs. Ashcroft,
darling, that Reginald Ashcroft loves you !
Oh ! Helen, think what happiness it would
be to me if my two dear pupils could be
united ! I do not believe, dearest, that you
are indifferent to him."

A faint colour tinted her cheek.

"I have known Reginald all my life, but I
see no reason therefrom why you should wish
to unite us, Mrs. Langridge, merely because
we were both your pupils."

The cold, forced tone of this reply caused
Mrs. Langridge to draw Miss Hazelhurst
closer to her. She took one of her hands in
hers.

I love you both as if you were my brother
and ray sister. That love is a stronger one

than can be given to a pupil, however dear.
I know of no better gift which as an elder
sister I could bestow, if it were mine to give,
than to give you to each other."

Spoken right queenly, alike your very
old self ! Bat, Mrs. Langridge, Mr. Reginald
Ashcroft has not himself asked for the hand
that you are so ready to bestow."

Not ' Mrs. Langridge' to you, Helen, but
simply Mary, your cousin Mary, who abjures
all queenly rights, and who only wishes to
make two loved ones happy."

Helen looked up hastily.

You have a right, cousin Mary, to speak
of two loved ones. I never doubted your
love for me, nor at one time at least your  '*

"What''

Love for Eeginald Ashcroft. See now "
and Helen's eyes flashed  '' I am not 
never was, and never shall be queen of
hearts, as you are. But if I ever have one
heart to rule over it must be mine, and mine
only."

My dearest Helen," said her cousin, " I
am much pained. You are in a great
error."

No, no ; I am in no error, and I love

you just the same. But I do know that
Reginald Ashcroft loved you for years, and
that before Herbert came on the scene you
must have loved him ! "

Must have loved him ? Helen ! "
I have seen you kiss his letters over andover
again. 'Tis rather hard that you should
carry off both my lovers. Confess, now, that
it is, cousin," with an attempt to smile.
But 'tis of no consequence. I came to see
you once more, darling old Polly ; let us not
waste our time about such useless talk," and
she laid her head on Mrs. Langridge's
shoulder.

"As you in some inscrutable way discovered
Reginald's youthful attachment, I
shall not deny its truth. Neither you nor
any other person would ever have known it
from me. It was not returned by myself,
however, nor did I ever receive any love
letter from my pupil. If you ever by
accident saw me fondly kiss any letters,
they were those of my dead mother. Helen,
in what a labyrinth your thoughts have been
wandering ! Would you really out of pique
let a man who truly loves you, and to whom
you are not indifferent, as I see more clearly

every moment, be made unhappy? This is
not like my generous, faithful Helen."

'* Eeginald has never told me that he cared
for me."

*' No, Helen ; you are wealthy. Eeginald
would rather be assured that you really did
care for him before he would seek the hand
of one almost reputed to be an heiress. I
verily believe from his character that if you
were absolutely penniless rather than dowered
as you are, he would not have gone to his
Eectory without declaring himself."

 Forgive my proud petulance, dear cousin.
Could I really believe that Reginald loved
me well enough to make me his wife now, I
could be happy. Had you ever loved him it
would have been quite different. Of course,
he could not help loving you  who could ? "
She put her arms round Mrs. Langridge's
neck. '' Everybody knows that you were
the making of him. I understand it all
now, I understand it all now ; it was his
love for you ! "

Love is a great teacher," answered
Mary, solemnly; "but never speak of that
again, dearest Helen. Both Herbert and
myself want so much to see him before we

leave England. May I write to him to come
and take a farewell of us for the sake of the
old times ?"

But you will not say that I am here ? "

Yes, but I shall, or we should not get
him, I fear. Have I permission ? But no, I
will not ask permission, I take the responsibility
on myself. But what about your
mother," Helen ? "

I think my mother will raise no objection
; she is very fond of Reginald, but I
almost wish I had not come."

I shall not compromise you, darling,
never fear ; wait a moment, it is soon done.
I will not write to your Eeginald anything
you may not like to read." And drawing
some writing materials near her, Mrs. Langridge
hastily wrote 

*' Dear Reginald,

Herbert says that he longs to see
you before we leave England. I need not
say that my own feelings also induce me
to write to ask you to do us that favour.
Your mother and father have kindly come,
and have brought with them another dear
old pupil of mine. Let me have the great
delight to see both my much-loved pupils

here together. The happiness of both is
very dear to me."

There, Helen, there is nothing very
improper in that, is there ? "

'' I had made up my mind that I would
never marry him before I came down here,"
said Helen, with somewhat of a frown.

And the roses of your cheeks had paled
in consequence," answered Mrs. Langridge,
and she sealed the letter and placed it with
others destined for the post.

"You will say nothing, I hope, to Sirs.
Ashcroft?" said Helen.

'' JS'o, nor to my own dear husband ; my
first deception," said Mary, laughing.

The dinner party that evening was bright
and the conversation animated. Almost all
were for the most part listeners, only throwing
in enough of the talking element in the
form of questions to prevent any stagnation.
The Colonel seemed the happiest of the party,
and a few half-hours daily with women so
refined and intellectual would, even at that
late hour of his life, have toned him down
considerably. As it was, his voice was much
more subdued than usual, and only once were

Lis own feelings shocked by the echoes of his
sonorous " By Jove ! " His own feelings were
more shocked apparently than those of anyone
else at the table, for smiles rather than
frowns were the most perceptible expressions
on every face except that of the offender, who
turned fiery red, and was very nearly perpetrating
a dozen other oaths in his stammering
attempts to cover that one into which he
had been betrayed. It was at rather a late
hour when Colonel Hanbury rose to go.

We shall see you tomorrow, I hope ?
You will join us again, Sir Robert ? " asked
Herbert, warmly.

No, Mr. Langridge, tomorrow I go back
to London. I go by an early train, but I
shall carry with me a most enjoyable remembrance
 it will last me. I have had a delights



ful evening. I came down, Mrs. Langridge,"
cried the honest old soldier, " expressly to try
and get a look at you. I am not ashamed of
it. No, by  Forgive me  no, I am not
ashamed of it. I did not expect to speak to
you, much less spend an evening with you. I
am very much gratified. Good-bye ; God bless
you  God bless you both. Your father was
a gallant officer, and your mother  well,

well, I knew them both. Good-bye, my dear,
and again, God bless you."

The old soldier's eyes were glistening.
Could they be really tears ?

We shall come back in five years. Colonel,"
said Herbert Langridge ; " we hope to meet
all old friends again."

'' Only five years ! " echoed Mary, tremulously.


Tears are catching, for there was no mistake
that they were shining in those grey eyes of
hers, and even Helen looked, as if in another
moment her lashes would hold similar pendants.


I am sixty-five," said Colonel Hanbury,
almost fiercely ; " a man cannot count on
five years at that age, though it may be.
Good-bye ; don't come to the door, I'd
rather not," he said, resolutely, and he
went.

'' I like that old soldier," said Herbert,
breaking the general silence which had fallen
upon them all; ''I did him an injustice."

The young Rector of Moreton had just
entered his library, where his breakfast was
laid. It was a library by name rather than

reality, for a few books hardly constitute a
right to any room to have so venerable a
name affixed to it, but this room was intended
for a library, and his predecessor
really possessed sufficient books to warrant
the assumption of the name ; but Reginald
Ashcroft was no book collector, and, notwithstanding
his success, and the almost
unexampled position which he had (certainly
through interest in a great measure) attained,
of a living at thirty-two, he could not by any
possibility develop into a reader. His tastes
were those of an ordinary country gentleman,
upon which was grafted the clergyman. Such
habits were more suitable to the society in
which he found himself ; to whom a studious
man would have been abhorrent, and as
every one of his tastes were moderate in
degree, and held so lightly that it could beat
any time laid down without a wrench, he
was in all respects a man who would always
be at peace with his flock, and this churchwardens
in particular; as no innovations
would unadvisedly creep in ; and although
from his love of neatness and decorum
generally some improvements might be expected,
yet not any susceptibilities on clerical

matters would be ruffled, as every change
would be so very gradual as hardly to be
perceived until it was thoroughly accepted.
A moderate man in all things, but a persistent
one, Avhat he did this year at
thirty-two he might be calculated upon as
doing at sixty-four, if his fine constitution
remained intact. Not a man, as we have
seen, to break his heart for love, but one,
nevertheless, who would hold on to his first
love out of sheer tenacity, until, like the
anemone when torn from its rock, he coi:rld
no longer clutch to any foundation, but be
cast absolutely adrift.

For six years he had held on to the possibility
of making Mary Myles his wife when
he was no longer the objectionable *' boy '*
she seemed to think him, and when he really
had something to offer. We have seen how
this base, to which he had clung, was dug
from under him. For the next four years,
by the force of habit, he had steadily pursued
the road to advancement, although
latterly with no hope of sharing the end
hoped for with the beloved one of his teens.
He rather looked forward as one of the
likeliest possibilities that he should drift (ashe

had told his father) into a sleek bachelor
rector, and never marry.

He liked agriculture moderately, but
enough to take an intelligent interest in the
land belonging to the Rectory. He liked
sport, as it is called in irony, surely, of the
sufferings it inflicts on the lower animals ;
but it was rather from the enjoyment of the
fresh breezes and the open-air exercise it
involved than from any pleasure he found in
bagging game, for he was a humane man,
into whose nature no fierceness could bestirred
up or provoked ; and another impulse
was given to out-door exercises in that he
was above all desirous to restrain within
proper limits an indication that with a life of
indolence he would develop fat.

These were the reasons that caused him to
leave his bed at least two hours before the
townsman expects to be called ; and as he
was punctual, and his habits were, as we have
seen, early, it was at eight o'clock, after some
miles had been gone over in coursing, riding,
or shooting that the Rector of Moreton sat
down to his solitary, simple breakfast in his
library, where the shelves would have been
almost bare had not all papers and periodicals

been ranged on them methodically, and so
helped to cover up some spaces which would
otherwise have been empty. The other rooms
were too large; the house had been built
with a view to the accommodation of the
usually large families appertaining to the
clergy as a rule, and this library was the
smallest and cosiest room for the usual resort
of a single man.

The clock in the hall was pointing to five
minutes to eight as the Rector, ruddier
with a deeper and browner red than heretofore,
took off his shooting jacket and
gaiters.

Any letters ? "

One, sir, which lies on the breakfast
table."

With placid face Reginald walked into the
library. He did not at once hasten to seize
the letter lying on his plate, but went and
stood before the fire in the attitude most
loved by men, but there was none other in
the room from whom his well-developed form
would have blocked out the cheerful flame,
and so far he was in his right.

He looked out for a few minutes on to his
well-kept lawn ; a few blackbirds, thrushes.

and starlings were having the breakfast he
always ordered for them.

I think we shall have a severe winter
after all, Hale; according to the old proverb,
when the days lengthen, the cold will
strengthen.' I shall get you to hang up
some more bones of meat in the shrubberies ;
I see the others are picked almost bare," and
then his thoughts went back to Sunnyside,
and his father's home, where tom-tits
abounded, and from tom-tits his mind by
a natural enough course went to Helen
Hazelhurst. How charming it would be to
see Helen on that lawn as the spring days
returned, in her pretty costumes, culling
some flowers for the breakfast table; but he
shook his head as if so preposterous an idea
ought to be and could be shaken off at a
moment's notice, and turned to the table,
where, his eye falling upon the aforesaid
letter, he quite leisurely stretched out his
hand, and, as was his wont, looked at superscription
and postmark before opening it.
What great study did it require to decipher
the Southampton postmark, and what was
there so enigmatical in that beautifully and
clearly written direction ? Whatever it was

Reginald Asbcroft made no haste to see the
contents, but looked fixedly at its exterior
only, and with an expression seldom seen on
his usually placid countenance. What power,
however, even the superscription on a letter
without reference to the contents can have
upon us, must be known to all who take up
in their hands the faded time yellowed
contents of their bureau, where letters of
some twenty years lie in their cells, tied up
in their severally assorted bundles. With
such a look as the faces of such exhibit
when their fingers touch one, which is like a
telegraphic message from the depths of
buried years, and sends an electric current
through every nerve, so in a minor degree
and in accordance with his character was the
countenance of the young Rector changed
and the more delicate fibres of his feelings
shaken. What now ! he had been asked by
his old friend Herbert to the wedding, but
Herbert knew nothing of his early love, or
he would not have asked anything so preposterous.
His mother had pressed him to accompany
them, and could not understand his
refusal; but she knew nothing also ; his father,
however, although he felt convinced that his

son had quite conquered a hopeless passion,
yet fully comprehended the situation, and
said quietly  " Of course not, my dear boy ;
who could under the lil<:e circumstances ? "
but here was a letter in Mary's own hand.
What would he have given formerly to have
seen such a one on his breakfast table ! But
none ever came. Yes, one had come, but its
taste was as bitter as gall to the youth who
was longing for some sweet medicine for his
ills. And here was one from the lady who
had married his friend after ten years' engagement.
Their constancy had outlived
his own, they deserved to be happy; and as
his thoughts became modified by this suggestion,
he slowly opened it, and very carefully
considered its contents, which were not
difficult to be mastered. " Going away to
India ; his old friend Herbert." There were
two strong motives, and the deterrent one
was the meeting his old love as a married
woman ; but then came in the figure of Helen.
What did Mrs. Langridge mean ? Yes, there
were some sweet reasons in what she said.
Both had been her pupils, and she was going
away. He owed her  why, yes, he owed to
her this comfortable Eectory ; he could not

have gone to her wedding, but now it was
quite different ; he ought to go to bid her
farewell, and then, he should see Helen 
not that he ever intended to marry, but still
he should like to see Helen. It was one additional
impetus to the scale, the balance
declined, he would go, and go immediately.

Five hours afterwards, travelling by an
express train, Reginald Ashcroft was deposited
at Southampton. After a hasty
refection, and some arrangements to his
dress at the railway hotel, the young E,ecfct)r
hastened to make his call, but he had not
proceeded far when he encountered his
father in company with another gentleman
whom only by the circumstance of such companionship
he judged to be his former friend.
The surprise of both at this meeting was so
loudly expressed that Reginald at once
understood that the letter of invitation
which he had received that morning, and so
promptly acted upon, was not a joint production,
but emanated from Mrs. Langridge
only. He consequently immediately restrained
the allusion to it which was just
about to escape from his lips as an explanation
of his sudden arrival. The hearty

VOL. II. s

welcome, however, accorded to him by
Herbert banished at once some rising
scruples.

** Well, old fellow, better late than never.
I should have been sorry not to have seen
you. In fact, I had thought of running over
by myself to your snuggery, only, you see, I
have been married but a few days after all.
Eeginald, you are a witness to the truth that
your path has been through pleasant pastures.
You are two years older than I, and yet
look at me."

I suppose a lawyer's life is a very
arduous one," said his friend, without contradicting
the patent fact that Herbert
Ijangridge at thirty had left the appearance
of youth far behind him ; " and you have
mounted the ladder so quickly."

'' You have not done amiss either, Rector,"
said Herbert smiling.

I have had so many helps," said Reginald,
quietly, and almost apologetically, " and some
patronage besides ; there is not much merit
due to myself."

The ladies are out shopping," said the
father. '' Joe Brunning has at last made up
his mind to marry our Phebe, and has given

me notice to put up the banns ; they will be
read for the first time next Sunday. Marriage
is infectious, I suppose ; anyhow, the
moment Joe knew that his patroness, the
erratum, had really entered the holy estate,
it determined him. I verily believe, however,
Herbert, that through that action of hers
your wife has lost the seraphic position she
formerly held in Joe's brain. I believe he
conceives that to be a erratum one must
be in a state of celibacy. Extremes meet,
and Joe Brunning and the Rector of St.
Mary's seem here to be in accord''

Herbert Langridge had heard of Joe and
his erratum that morning. Reginald was
well up in his father's favourite story, and
both men smiled.

So Mrs. Langridge has gone this morning
with your mother and Miss Hazelhurst  ah,
by-the-bye, she is here," said the Yicar, turning
to his son, " to make purchases of suitable
presents for the couple. If we go in the
direction of the town perhaps we shall meet
them, eh, Herbert ? They were out early, and
it is not far off our luncheon time."

How was it that in a few minutes Reginald
Ashcroft found himself walking between th

lady of his boyhood's dreams and the girl for
whom he was quite conscious of a nascent
affection ? Helen had turned red and pale
alternately at the sudden meeting at the
corner of a road, but she had smiled also.
At meeting her perhaps Reginald would have
reddened also if a stronger power in the
presence of Mrs. Langridge had not put to
flight such evidence of emotion. After a
little while Helen, however, fell back and
rejoined Mrs. Ashcroft, who was walking
with her husband and Herbert. Then and
then only, when he was conscious that there
Alas a vacancy on his left side, did Eeginald
turn with something like a lively interest to
see what had become of the handsome girl
whose skirts had brushed him a few minutes
since, and a deeper red did then dye his brow,
seeing that she had left him to join his mother.
Eeginald," said Mary, in a low voice.
Again recalled to that presence ever so potent
for him, by the mere tone of her voice, he
turned as hastily and inclined his head to Mrs.
Langridge. " We are going away the day
after tomorrow. I wrote to you of my own
accord, because you know that I have always
loved you as a younger brother. I want to

see your life put on its proper footing before
we leave."

What a strange speech ; what could she
mean?

"It is time that you were married, Reginald."


The Eector felt the same momentary repulsion
to be thus advised by Mrs. Langridge as
Helen had done.

"Mrs. Langridge, I am the best judge of
that. I have no thought of marrying."

''Do not be angry. From anyone else's
would be an impertinence, but not from me.
If you think a little while you will see that it
is not an impertinence from me."

Is there any necessity that I should marry,
Mrs. Langridge ? "

Yes ; otherwise you will sink into a self-indulgent,
easy-going country rector, of
whom there are already too many. You have
not the gifts required of a real celibate."

You are complimentary, Mrs. Langridge."

It is true, and you know it."

There was silence. The young Rector
whipped some pebbles away with his stick, as
we once saw him strike at a hedge.

You have always assumed a kind of

censorship over me, Mrs. Langridge. I owe
much to you, and I acknowledge it. What
do you want of me now ? "

'' Follow the dictates of your heart."

It was you who forbade me to follow them
once."

Follow them now ; the past is gone."

I have no doubt about your meaning,
dear Mrs. Langridge. It is meant well. You
have always meant well by me, and not me
alone. But how can you, who have always
scorned wealth, ask me to do this thing 
you, of all people in the world."

** Because in this case wealth is an accident,
and if it did not exist you would not have a
shadow of excuse."

*' Excuse ! "

*' Yes, excuse ! You should not have been
so frequent a visitor at Sunny side, to begin
with."

I am not so conceited a fool as I was in
my boyhood, Mrs. Langridge. You wrong
me if you mete me by that measure."

Mr. Langridge is about to join us," said
Mary, glancing round. " You love Helen
Hazelburst, and your love is returned. You
will lose all the place you have long held in

mj heart as my first, my oldest pupil, if you
allow any narrow sentiments to crush out
feeling," and, turning round, Mary met her
husband and linked her arm in his.

Well, what have you bought for poor
Joe?"

Among other things, which were chiefly
for Phebe, his bride, that which will gladden
him exceedingly, as it will be a possession
hitherto unattainable  a cuckoo clock. There
was one in the housekeeper's room at
Sunnyside, and it was told me once that Joe
declared if that clock were his, he should
think that he was in Paradise."

In Paradise ! I should rather feel myself
somewhere else had I such a possession
always near me," said Herbert, laughing.

'* Ah ! but poor Joe was devotedly fond of
the song of the cuckoo. It was the one bird
that made his eyes glisten to hear, and to
hear the cuckoo all the year round, night and
day. Oh ! I think there is some poetry in
poor Joe, uncouth though he is in appearance."


"Yes; there you are quite right. Joe
had poetry and aspirations, but they were
smothered like those of many another poor

fellow's higher feelings, and could not get
beyond the germinating stage. I think it was
you, Mary, who caused even that early process
in growth, which was arrested when your presence
was taken from him."

When we are in India, Herbert, I must
look out for some curiosity or ornament to
send him direct. Anything coming from
beyond seas,' as Joe would express it, would
lift him to the seventh heaven."

*' So be it. I have cause to remember Joe
as well as you, dearest ; it was he who guided
me to your garden on the most eventful day
of my life. But here we are at our hotel,
and where are the others ? Why, we are all
in pairs, and have left them far behind, and
Reginald and Cousin Helen are the last of all,
and, I think, standing still. How fond that
young Eector is of a stick; he seems to be
pointing out something to his companion
just in the manner that one sees in old
engravings, where paterfamilias is endeavouring
to awaken, by means of his
stick, the consciousness of wife and children
to something like an intelligent perception of
landscape or some architectural beauties.
Why are you laughing, Mary ? "

* I do not know unless it is that I am so
very happy."

Why is it that after childhood a confession
of happiness is so seldom heard ? Is
it merely because it is not a durable possession
? Suppose it be not, why should not
its temporary visit be, therefore, acknowledged
with thankfulness ? A novelist much
appreciated in his day has said that people
always shrink from saying '' How happy I
am." Possibly, and so they shrink too often
from the expression of every form of gratitude.
Would that they would shrink rather
from declarations of an opposite character,
and spare their friends and relations the
utterances of a whining discontent.

Well, I don't know," proceeded Herbert,
after he had reconnoitred the couple for a
long time through his glass, " but it seems
to me, Mary, that those two young people
are now walking hand-in-hand. Stay," and
he altered the focus, " it's a fact ! Why,
Mary, what does this mean ? " and Herbert
looked with bewilderment into his wife's
smiling face.

It means, I hope, that the will walk
hand-in-hand through life."

And it also means, I think," rejoined her
husband, laughing with almost his old boyish
heartiness, " that, in addition to her other
qualifications, I have secured a good diplomatist
in my wife."

lapse of time ! flying years !

That fell the while.

Nor note thy wintry doubts and fears ;

But numbering thy springs  O years ,

Look up and smile.

Five years later breakfast was again laid in
the library of Moreton Rectory, but the
young Rector had not been out coursing as
upon a former occasion, but had been engaged
in tying up roses, with a handsome woman at
his side who held the necessary implements
and handed them to him when they were
required. The library, too, had undergone a
change ; there were no longer scantily covered
shelves, where papers and periodicals were
mostly conspicuous, but from floor to ceiling,
massive and very orthodox looking volumes

filled the formerly empty spaces. Helen and
her mother had gone over more than once to
inspect the Rectory in the weeks preceding
the marriage, so clearly foreshadowed in the
last chapter, and the first thing that appealed
to Helen was the clerical look of the
Eector's library. Her first silent determination
was, therefore, that it should be
promptly furnished with books, but furnished
without the Rector's knowledge as her
wedding present to her husband, so that on
their return from their wedding trip he might
find his shelves filled with a goodly array of
volumes. To accomplish this she went upto
London and presented herself at a well-known
ecclesiastical bookseller s, and stated
her wish to be supplied with the most suitable
works for a clergyman's library. The
first question disconcerted her 

'' What are the gentleman's views ? "

Whatever does the man mean ? " thought
Helen.

As she looked perplexed, the next question
was put more definitely 

Was the Rector high, or broad, or
low?"

Oh ! I want a good library ! " answered
Helen ; " not where a reader can only find

one thought expressed in different ways, buta
good library ; nevertheless, one especially
adapted for a clergyman."

Here was a good margin.

Was the gentleman a good classic ? "

Helen, remembering who her intended
husband's tutor had been, and his general
success, answered promptly, "Certainly!"
and the thing was done ; no translations were
to be admitted.

The young couple were on the pleasant
shores of the Riviera whilst the library of the
unconscious bridegroom was being weighted
with the ponderous tomes of the Fathers and
Doctors of the Church, all, as Helen prided
herself, being in the original Greek.

With what joyous contentment and satisfaction
did the happy wife regard her husband's
astonished look on the morning after
their return home, as he stood in the middle
of the room and gazed on his lately acquired
literary wealth with amazement. He could
only say 

Why, Helen ! "

"I think you will find them all there,"
she answered, with proud consciousness ;
Tertullian, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Origen,
and all the rest. I am sure I cannot remember

half their names, and they are all in
the originals ; and you see they are all in the
proper church binding. I hope you are
pleased ? "

'' A man would be a stolid wretch, Helen,
who was not gratified at so noble a gift ; but
but  dearest, do you demand me to read
them ? It would take me my life."

Of course you'll have to read them ! "
cried innocent Helen, putting aside his suggestion
as excess of modesty ; " every clergyman
does. But on the other side," she said,
turning him round, " you'll find the works of
all the best English divines when you want a
change from the Greek. Of course there are
no light books here. I have had them all put
into what is going to be our morning-room,
along with my own books. I have a goodly
array of them. We must not have breakfast
here, you know, Reginald, as a rule ; it
would be quite like sacrilege."

Let us breakfast here once or twice a
week, Helen, if it be only that I may enjoy
looking upon your generous gift."

Well," said Helen, somewhat reluctantly,
we'll do so for the present; but, dear Reginald,
do not call it a generous gift again; ita
love gift, and you'll be in their midst often

enough. All clergymen have to pass hours
every day in their studies and libraries."

And this morning, following the rule then
established, breakfast was laid in the library
where the good Fathers reposed in peaceful,
undisturbed rest.

A letter from dear Cousin Mary ! " cried
Helen ; " here's a treat in store for you, Reginald.
What a beautiful handwriting it is ! "

I think it is perfect," said the Rector.

And the writer perfection. Is it not so,
Reginald ? She alone does all things well"

That is true," said the Rector ; " and
never so well as when she made you mine,"
and he looked over her shoulder as his wife
broke the seal.

Shall I read it, or shall we read it
together ? "

We will read it together," answered
Reginald, and sliding his left arm round her
he held the letter with his right hand to
steady it whilst the opposite page was in his
wife's left hand, her right resting upon his
shoulder. We will also, looking over both
their shoulders, read with them.

"Dearest Helen,

The time is approaching when, in all
probability, we shall return to England as was

expected. There have been Tnany difficulties,
which at one time seemed to render that
event still to be regarded as a future one,
instead of being near ; and these have been
hindrances to mj writing to you, as I wished
to pause before doing so in order that I might
know what plans we could decide upon making.
"Herbert and myself have well considered
the matter, though doubtless you will be
surprised at its requiring any consideration
when the fact of his retirement, with full
pension and a baronetcy, was the price held
out to him before he left England ; otherwise
I do not think he had the intention of returning
at all, as it now appears that he was most
averse to bringing me here ; but the bait was
too much [for him, dear fellow. He was so
delighted at the idea of making me a Lady.
Behold, wherefore, he took up this judgeship !
But he regards all these things differently
now. To accept a baronetcy and to leave
India, retiring at the early age of thirty-five
on full salary, is unprecedented. The
baronetcy had no attractions for myself 
quite the reverse. Had it not been for the
children, and for the sake of his own health,
I should have counselled staying the full
term of twenty years ; but our two dear little

ones could not be sacrificed, and to send them
away to England  even to my darling Helen
no, it could not be; or to go with them
myself and leave Herbert there alone indelicate
health (for the climate of India does
not suit him, he is too energetic for it, and it
is wearing him out). How could I consent I
There only appeared to us one honourable
solution  to resign on account of his health
and to decline the retiring pension and also
the baronetcy ; which we have done. I perfectly
understand now the cause of the
departure from ordinary rules in the case of
Herbert. He works as no other man has
ever worked. It is killing him. He would
not have liked it to be thought that the
presence of his wife had made him less
arduous. Sharing this feeling, I have never
discouraged his energy. It would take too
long to explain to you the reasons why he is
so much estimated ; it will suffice to say that
outside his judgeship he has rendered the
Government most important services in pacifying
the native Princes, arbitrating between
them and settling their claims. He is, in
truth, a most valuable servant, but for all
that we will not clutch at the reward. I say

we,' because I have worked with him, having
been his secretary all along save when it was
necessary for me to have temporary rest.
Herbert is getting anxious also about me, so
there is no other way.

''I have entered into all these business
matters because you made some allusion in
your last letter to my returning as Lady
Lanofridge. Thank God ! it will not be so.
We shall have ample means for living a
simple country life in England, which was
always my desire. I feared lest Herbert
might be disappointed if he were not 671-
7iohled, but he has cast all that aside quite
cheerfully.

And now, having exhausted all these dry
details, I hasten to reply to a more homely
but more soul-engrossing topic. I am glad
to tell you that Grantham is a fine healthy
boy, and is not at present affected by the
climate. Herbert and myself have lately
agreed to call him by his second name 
Grantham  and not Reginald, as sometimes
it is awkward when the little ones bear the
same names as their elders; and when we
return to England we hope to see a great
deal of you both ; and cousin Reginald will
always be * Reginald ' with myself and husband.

I do not know how it will fare with
mj little girl's two legitimate names  ' Margaret
Brereton,' for she is only called ' Mary-gold
' here. Herbert loses all his careworn
looks when this child is present. He delights
in driving his fingers through her hair,
and making it stand up all round her face,
which it readily does, as it is more wavy, or
rather grizzly, than my own, which you know
always objected to lie down ; and the child's
hair is in fact literally like cried gold
threads from the very roots. I suppose I
have heard a hundred times dear Herbert's
delighted exclamation, ' What else is she buta
marigold ! ' after he has succeeded in
making it stand out like rays around her
fair little face, where the blue eyes laugh out
from the midst of the living aureole. Forgive
me, darling ; you are yourself a fond
mother, and know the garrulous weakness
appertaining to such individuals. Talking of
*Marigold,' carries me to Margaret Brereton,
her godmother by proxy. I had a letter
from the dear girl only yesterday, in which
there were also a few lines to Herbert from
the father. She is carrying on the work of
the Marigold Guild bravely, and helps her
father in every way, studying always with

him. How glad I am for her father s sake !
a holy man, Helen, and a true. I long
for you and Reginald to know him.

I cannot write any more, as being still
secretary, I have much work on my hands.
Kindest regards from both to dear cousin
Reginald, and much love to yourself, from
your cousin

May.

Just a few words to say that I know
nothing about the exquisite water-colour
drawing you speak of as found in Dr. Grantham's
portfolio, labelled in the doctor's handwriting
as ' Nausikaa,' which Mr. Ashcroft
has secured, thinking that it must be a portrait
of myself when a girl. I was certainly
at no time drawn in the character of Nau-
sikaa, nor playing with a ball, although I
was very fond of that simple sport in my
girlish days. Dear Dr. Grantham, I remember,
had an especial admiration for that
young Homeric princess, so much so, that
in his last moments, when his mind was
wandering, and speech had almost failed, I
heard him in broken accents murmur ' Nau-
sikaa.'"
