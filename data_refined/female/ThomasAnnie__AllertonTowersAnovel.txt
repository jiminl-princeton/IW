CHAPTEE I.

MRS. Feathered's GARDEN PARTY.

IIALTEE, I may as well tell you
/H that mother thinks we have been
very premature and foolish."

"And I may as well tell you, Ethel, that
your mother shows great want of consistency
in saying so*'

Mother doesn't go in for being consistent,"
the girl laughs, joyously ; " she speaks and
acts on impulse as a rule, and this morning
she told me she had one of her strong
intuitions against our being engaged ; you
see your practice isn't much yet, Walter ;
mother's only prudent after all."

"And do you want to be prudent too,
Ethel ? " he asks, and his voice trembles
a little as he manfully strives to steady it.

VOL. I. B

His feelings are being cruelly assailed by the
remarks which the girl to whom he has been
engaged a week is repeating so carelessly.

She laughs again, but her mirth is not
quite spontaneous.

I don't want to plunge into poverty, I
must admit."

Poverty ! a day or two ago you were
willing enough to face the future with me,
darling ; what has changed you ? Your
mother was satisfied with the prospect I
offered then ; what has made her dissatisfied
with it now ? I can give you a good home,
surround you with every comfort." He
pauses abruptly, for Ethel's eyes and attention
are evidently wandering back to a
group on the lawn, the centre of Which is
a young, handsome man of unmistakably
good form," to whose utterances all the
girls who grace Mrs. Heath erle's garden
party are listening with almost too flattering
attention.

"Who's that fellow?" Walter Gifford
the young surgeon, who has within the last
six months made himself a medical power in

this district  asks pugnaciously, and Ethel
Heatherley answers, in a state of tremulous
excitement,

"Don't you know? that is Lord Manus
Boyne  the Marquis of Monks town's second
son.

Now I know why your mother has grown
prudent so suddenly," Mr. Gilford says, quietly.
Then he takes Ethel's small hands in his, and
holds her fast while he says, " Why has Mrs.
Heatherley got that good-looking boy here to
dazzle all you girls ? he's a young scamp,
Ethel, sent here to do penance at poor old
Townley's, for having been a naughty boy
at Oxford ; he has a courtesy title and eighty
pounds a-year, and your mother wants you to
throw me over for him!"

You're very rude, Walter," Ethel says,
her cheeks growing crimson in a condemnatory
way at once ; " mother has asked him
here as she always asks Mr. Townley's pupils ;
she can't help his being attentive and handsome
and having a title, and  and how do
you dare to imply that dear mother is a
match-maker ? "

B 2

Don't get savage, Ethel "

Then don't you be jealous ! "

As the girl says this, there flutters towards
them one of the prettiest and youngest-looking
of matrons. Mrs. Heatherley, who has a
well-grown daughter of twenty, looks at the
first glance little more than thirty herself,
for she has the fair beauty and the slenderness
of limb which makes middle-age pass
for youth.

Dressed to perfection to-day in pink sateen
with pockets and cuffs and piping of ruby
velvet, the pretty blonde widow commands
almost as much admiration as does her beautiful
brunette daughter Ethel, as she flits
hither and thither on her closely-shaven lawn,
seeing to the amusement and well-being of
her guests.

She has achieved a great social success.
The lord-lieutenant of the county and his
wife are here, and the Bishop of Atherton
Towers and his daughter; and, indeed, everybody
who is anybody in all the region round
has accepted her invitation for lawn-tennis
and strawberries and cream this day. But

she feels a crumple in her rose-leaf! Her
only child has just before wilfully' engaged
herself to a hard-working young country
surgeon, and now a marquis's son has come
and found her fair.

Such a marquis's son too ! It is all very
well for malignant envy and jealousy to sneer,
and hint that the Marquis of Monkstown
derives his income from Irish property  the
rents of which are not paid in these days.

Mrs. Heatherley knows better. His lordship
is no mere feckless, improvident, out-elbows
Irish peer ! Mrs. Heatherley has it
on Mrs. Townley's authority that he has todo,
surreptitiously, but remunerative, with
indigo and coffee, and that he can snap his
fingers at his non-rent-paying tenants. The
eldest son. Lord E. Kenmare, is delicate, if
not imbecile, and Lord Marcus is the second
son  and  well 

"A coronet would become Ethel well, and
it's not with my consent that she shall throw
herself away on a mere country practitioner,"
the ambitious lady tells herself; and immediately
afterwards she makes that remark to

Ethel, as to their having been very premature
and foolish in enfjaa:ine themselves to one
another, which Ethel has frankly repeated
to her lover.

As Mrs. Heatherley flutters up to the
young pair, into the music of whose love
and contentment she has introduced a discordant
strain, she looks so gladly and gaily
unconscious of having said or done anything
antagonistic to Mr. Gifford's interests, that he
is almost inclined to believe that she is as well
pleased with the engagement as she professed
herself to be at first. Such a dear little airy
impulsive woman ! So evidently quick to feel,,
and prompt to act as her feelings dictate !
Her future son-in-law can but admire hers
and think that his Ethel has perverted
her mother's meaning, rather than think
Mrs, Heatherley is either inconsistent, or foolish
enough to wish to displace him for Lord
Marcus Boyne.

Her first words make him change this
view of things.

"My dear Mr. Gifford," she begins, in her
bright, electrical, young Away, "(/o forgive me

for putting your interest before your pleasure ;
I am going to take you away from Ethel, and
introduce you to the Bishop and Miss Templeton
: he is a martyr to the gout, you
know, the dear old thing, and if you are
called in at the Palace, the whole of Aller-ton
Towers will be sending for you ; Ethel,
Miss Templeton has been sitting alone for the
last ten minutes ! I can't be everywhere,
can I ? " she continues, appealingly ; " so
you must sacrifice yourself a little to our
guests."

The Bishop hasn't the gout at the present
moment, so he don't want me, and Miss
Templeton is exercising her maidenly wiles
on Townley's new cub, so she doesn't want
Ethel," Walter Gifford says, in a way that
implies, under these circumstances, he means
to keep Ethel to himself  apart from the
others  a little longer.

Mrs. Heatherley makes a face expressive
of excruciating suffering, and then explains
the cause of it.

It would give me intense pain if the
St. Justss and the Bishop remark that my

daughter neglects her social duties," she says,
seriously ; " and as Ethel would not wish me
to feel pain or annoyance on her account,
she will do as I wish her, of course ; and
you really must let me introduce you to
his lordship."

She* puts a coaxing hand on the young
man's arm as she speaks, and he feels himself
being slowly but surely propelled towards
the ecclesiastical potentate whose patronage
she professes to be anxious to secure for him.
Meantime, he sees Ethel going off in the
direction of Miss Templeton, who is bending
a gracious ear to all the folly it pleases
Lord Marcus to utter. Walter Gifford's 
heart whispers to him, that
not for many minutes longer will the Bishop's
daughter have the opportunity of so visibly
condescending to a mere man. For Ethel
has the winning power to a rare degree,
and Walter knows, from sweetly bitter experience,
that it is not in her gracious nature
to refrain from exercising it.

He is introduced to the Bishop, who is
urbane to, but evidently uninterested in, him ;

in spite of the eulogistic words Avhicli Mrs.
Heatherley speaks of him.

My lord, allow me to introduce a friend
of mine, Mr. Gifford, one of the few people
Who makes this wilderness of Atherton endurable
and pleasant to me."

In response to this direct call upon his
proverbial urbanity, the Bishop smiles briefly,
says " he is happy, he is sure, to make the
acquaintance of anyone who is fortunate
enough to find favour in Mrs. Heatherley's
eyes ; " and then, having been previously
apprised as to the calling of the young
man, who is now supposed to be a suppliant
for his favour, goes on to say that he hopes
he finds the climate salubrious and the
population healthy."

The instinct of self-preservation makes
me regret that I am able to answer your
lordship's hopes satisfactorily," Walter says,
savagely ; for Ethel, Miss Templeton, and
Lord Marcus Boyne have just sauntered upto
the group of Which he is one, and he
sees a look of merrily-malicious amusement
in Ethel's brown velvet eyes, at the way in

which her mother is striving to make him
perform for patronage.

"It's just Hke papa always to say the
wrong thing to people of that sort," Miss
Templeton mutters to Lord Marcus, and
Ethel hears the words and understands
their full meaning.

Her colour rises with her generous wrath.
Shall she stand by and hear the position of
her lover  the man to whom her troth is
plighted !  assailed, without saying one word
of rebuke ? or shall she spare the assailant,
who is her guest, according to the dictates of
hospitality ? For a moment she wavers, then
she says :

'' What sort of people does the Bishop
say the right thing to, Miss Templeton"'

Oh, to our own class, or the very poor,
papa is always happy in his expressions, and just
what he should be in manner ; but to people of
that sort " (and Miss Templeton, as she speaks,
nods her head towards the young surgeon)
"the Bishop is apt to be uncomfortable."

Local apothecary, isn't he ? " Lord Marcus
asks, tersely.

Yes," Ethel says, facing him in her perfect
prettiness and irreproachable style, " that, if
you please to call him so ; and something
else, as I please to call him ; the man
who is going to marry me, by-and-bye ! 
my ' sweetheart,' in our plain old country
vulgar tongue."

The young fellow she addresses is very
handsome, very thoroughbred, very fascinating
and dazzling in his gay, bright way,
but he is very boyish still! Consequently,
he bursts into a loud, rather derisive laugh,
and says:

Come, now. Miss Heatherley, don't
chaff a fellow too much ; you going to marry
a ' local practitioner,' that's too awfully awful
a joke."

But I am' Ethel is saying, with steady
severity, when her mother again intervenes.

Flitting up in the most guileless way possible,
the active little parent-bird is by the
side of the brave but injudicious young
one in a moment.

"Ethel, dear. Lady St. Just was saying just
now, she had not spoken a word to you today

; go to her, my child : Miss Templeton
and Lord Marcus" (this with ever so sweet a
smile) " will excuse you, I am sure. Lady St.
Just is quite another mother to my child," the
vivacious little hostess says, fluttering in between
her two guests, and contriving to direct
Lord Marcus's attention to the graceful way
in which Ethel is crossing the lawn towards
martial-looking Lady St. Just.

Then she's prepared to adopt 'Sawbones,'
too, I suppose ? " Lord Marcus says, imprudently.
He has yet to learn that Mrs.
Heatherley can snub as well as she can
court.

What a nice, unsophisticated boy you
are," she says, innocently ignoring the fact
that youth objects to few things so much as
having itself forced crudely into the fierce
light of sarcastic observation; "it's an old
joke from Pickwick to call a surgeon a 'saw-bones'"
she continues, in an explanatory
tone, to Miss Templeton ; isn't it refreshing
to meet with any young man hi these days
who is sufficiently world-worn to quote such
nearly-forgotten Witticisms? "

Her tone is so full of feminine kindness as
she speaks her biting words, that Lord Marcus
is undecided whether he ousht to hate
her for the rudeness, which may be unintentional,
and which is making him smart, or
like her for the liking she expresses so
openly for him ! Eventually he decides in
favour of doing the latter, for, besides having
the claim to manly toleration of being a
pretty woman still, she is Ethel's mother!
And already his heart has gone out to Ethel,
with a young man's pure, adoring, but still
passionate love.

So, with the courtesy of his caste, he accepts
the snub so gracefully and graciously,
that Mrs. Heatherley is half inclined to regret
having given it to him,

"If you had called me 'vulgarly malicious,'
instead of ' nice and unsophisticated,' you
would have been nearer the mark, Mrs.
Heatherley," he says, with proud boyish candour.
"I won't err again in your estimation
at least, not in that way."

"And on my side I promise to look very leniently
on your errors," Mrs. Heatherley says,

softly, but not so softly but that Miss Templeton
hears the words, and malignantly repeats
them, by-and-bye, to her right-reverend father,
whom she undutifully suspects of a desire to
change his state, whenever he sees much of
the late Mr. Heatherley's agreeable and good-looking
little relict.

Meantime, the onus of sustaining a conversation
with a man who evidently labours
strenuously to converse with him, is becoming
a burden, heavier than he can bear, to Walter
Gifford. With that fatal perspicuity, which
is one of the gifts which become curses to
true love, he sees all that Ethel is doing, and
all that Ethel's mother is meaning for her.
He sees her drawn into the magic circle which
surrounds fiercely-aristocratic old Lady St.
Just, who from her heights of age and rank,
treats Ethel and Lord Marcus as boy and girl,
and thus gives them the opportunity of being
more intimate and familiar than they otherwise
would have been. Though he does not
hear the words they speak, for the Bishop
beams at him at brief intervals, he can feel
the arrangements for future meetings that are

being made with "her ladyship's cognisance and
sanction. His Ethel will be riding and dancing
and playing tennis with this young lordling,
whom in his heart he is calling " an arrogant
beast of a boy," in places to which he
Walter Gifford  will have no right of access
! He sees it all now ! Her mother's recantation
of the cordial assent she had given
at first to their engagement ; the motive for
making the effort to get the St. Justss and the
Bishop to this garden party, in order that
Ethel may get return invitations to the set in
which Lord Marcus will revolve ; the reason
why always charmingly-dressed Ethel is more
charmingly dressed than ever to-day  all
these things are seen and understood by him
with horrible distinctness, and summed up
tersely in his own mind thus :

The mother's a designing woman, and
she'll try to make Ethel throw me over for
that boy with a handle to his name ; but
I'll have a fight for her."

I don't think you quite admit the force
of my remarks ? " the Bishop questions,
suavely, at this juncture, and Walter Gifford

ruins his chance of ever being called
upon to assuage gouty pangs in the episcopal
feet and legs, by answering bluntly :

I didn't hear them, my lord."

Papa, have you asked Lord Marcus for
tomorrow ? " Miss Templeton puts in, with
a little air of eagerness, which is meant to
show " the mere country surgeon " that he
is so completely outside their circle that they
can discuss social arrangements before him
with the same freedom they feel before servants
and inferiors generally.

For tomorrow ? " the Bishop asks, perplexedly.


Yes, to dinner ! don't you remember ?
Lord and Lady St. Just are coming and Mrs.
Heatherley and Ethel."

Walter Gilford turns away sharply and
hears no more. In another moment he has
gained Ethel's side, and detached her from
the aristocratic group who are seeking to
absorb her.

Ethel," he begins, a little too gravely,
why haven't you told me that you dine at
the Palace tomorrow ? "

Really, Walter," Ethel says, with some of
her mother's vivacity (vivacity which strikes
Mr. Gifford painfully as being assumed) ;
really, Walter ! did I undertake to tell you
where I dined every day Avhen we became
engaged ? "

You put it in a way that makes me seem
a petty tyrant, even in my own eyes ; and yet
I know I'm right and you're wrong the whole
time," he says, wearily ; and Ethel, quick to
mark the change in him, has lier hand on his
arm, clasping it caressingly in a moment.

"Walter! don't look tired and disappointed,
it hurts me ; mother told me not to
say anything about dining at the Palace, ' it
would look like boasting,' she thought ; and
mother has such perfect taste and tact, now,
hasn't she?"

She has indeed ! such perfect taste and
tact that I feel I jar upon her at every turn
to-day," he says, bitterly.

No, you don't." the girl cries, with quick
compunction ; " only do be broad and look at
things as they are, and not try to distort them
into what you think they ought to be ; be as

VOL. I. C

friendly with Lord Marcus Boyne as he Avoid
be with you, and take it for granted, Walter,,
that / shall keep my promise as sacredly to-you
as I should do to a peer of the realm""
The girl draws herself up and looks proud
and noble, true and trustworthy, to a degree
that reassures him, as she says this. And for
the hour Walter Gifford is satisfied that the
idol he has set up will never prove false to
him.

CHAPTER II.

THE bishop's daughter.

do the Bishop justice, he would
rather go without the dinner than
give it to-day. And this, not because
he is an ascetic on principle, but simply
because his digestion is out of repair, and his
bones are aching;.

It is hard on him that these things should
be, for he has lived sparsely for many a long
year ; and now that the good things of this
life are about him abundantly, he does not
dare to indulge in them, any more than if he
had revelled in them from his cradle.

But his daughter has ordained this dinner ;
and what is socially ordained by Miss
Templeton, at the Palace, is as the laws of
the Modes and Persians.

At times she runs her social ways mysteriously,
giving out an impression subtly
that she has a deeper meaning hidden in her

c2

virgin heart than is given out and suffered to
appear on the surface. If the Bishop utters
a faint protest against the expediency of
having a lawn-tennis party, when the clouds
are loweringly threatening rain ; or hints that
it would be pleasant for him to defer a state
dinner until such time as there might be a
slight chance of his being able to eat some of
it, his daughter's reply invariably crushes out
all opposition.

I have a reason for having it now, papa ;
you know I never do anything without a
motive."

i To-day, Fanny Templeton has a very strong
motive for insisting on this dinner coming off
 a motive that, though not noble, is, at least,
essentially feminine. Her mature fancy has
been favourably affected by Mr. Townley's
handsome, aristocratic, gay-hearted young
pupil, and she desires to give him the chance
of reciprocating her flattering sentiments.
She has been a girl so long that she cannot
get out of the habit of thinking herself one
still, though she has had ten more years'
experience of life than Lord Marcus.

And, to be quite fair to her, the mistake of
regarding herself as a girl still, is a pardonable
one on her part ; for if a woman is
only as old as she looks, it must be admitted
that Fanny Templeton looks very young
indeed. She is one of those fair, soft-looking
women, whose cheeks retain the roses and
roundness of youth well on into middle age.

She has, too, one of those coolly constituted
natures that never take it out of their possessors
by giving way to deep or violent
emotions. Her blue eyes are not in the habit
of shedding tears, for no trouble worth crying
about has ever touched herself, and she is a
very heroine in the way in which she can
calmly contemplate the troubles of others.
Her father has been Bishop of Atherton Towers
for ten years now, and during these ten years
she has had no need to take depressing heed
to pecuniary ways and means. Additionally,
she has had thrust upon her a delightful sense
of social importance, and in small, soft ways,
social importance is very dear to the good
Bishop's daughter. Altogether, the circumstances
of her life are rejuvenating, and she

is justified in feeling that, as far as looks go,
age need be no barrier to the alliance she
hopes to compass.

But Ethel Heath erle may be ! Miss
Templeton rarely deceives herself, whatever
she may do to others ; and she admits that,
whereas she is only a pretty young woman,
Ethel Heatherley is a beautiful young girl,
upon whom Lord Marcus Boyne has already
bestowed very favourable glances. She
recognises the fact also that if Ethel does
enter the lists against her, that it will be a
case of two to one ; for Mrs. Heatherley will
be on Ethel's side, and Fanny Templeton is
fully aware of the widow's value as an ally
and dangerous qualities as an opponent.
And these two are not tie sole barriers
between herself and holy matrimony with
Lord Marcus.

The Bishop has a chaplain !

This fact, as an isolated one, is unimportant.
Every Bishop has a chaplain,
and frequently nature and Providence combine
to make a union between the Bishop's
chaplain and the Bishop's daughter a highly

desirable thing. But in this case Fanny
Templeton has come to feel that it would
be, to say the least of it, unadvisable for
her to throw herself away on a mere
Reverend Bernard Grove, when it is in
the order of things " that may be " that
she shall become eventually the Marchioness
of Monkstown.

It is true that " things have been," between
Bernard Grove and the Bishop's daughter,
which are not now. It is the fashion of
smart leader writers, reviewers, and others
of that ilk, to represent and pretend to
believe that a curate is necessarily a rather
effeminate, poor-spirited, mild-game-playing,
weakly, flirting sort of creature. They
heighten the obnoxious tones in which they
paint this picture by sneering allusions to the
impunity with which ladies, young and old,
may " pet " the shepherd of the flock, and
assume an idiotic air of surprise if a curate
" a 'poor curate " is the happy phrase to
properly describe him  does anything that
commends itself to the eyes of the world
as indisputably manly. Why this idea

should pervade the press-reviewing and
ordinary fiction writing mind is incomprehensible
to every one who mixes indecent
society, and knows that the clergy
are quite up to the level of not only
gentlemanliness," but " manliness," as exhibited
by the members of any other
profession, class,, or clique. Nor does the
person who mixes in this aforesaid decent
society find that the " poor curate " differs
in any way from the " rich rector " in birth,
breeding, education, or manner. But those
who are outside the pale of good society do
not understand or realise this truism. And
so the innumerable vulgar men and women,
who supply cheap periodicals with emotional
stories of that life among the upper
classes of which they know nothing, invariably
portray " the curate " as a susceptible
ass, or a scheming, hungry fortune-hunter,
and make fatuous jokes about his goodness
and poverty for the edification and amusement
of the dissenting masses.

It shall be told at once that Bernard Grove
is not a type of either of these classes. He

is merely an honourable, good, good-looking,
well-bred, and equally well-read gentleman.
Poor enough, in all conscience, to satisfy the
greedy desire of all those who would see the
priests of the Lord impecunious. But neither
mean-spirited nor threadbare, crawling nor
audacious on the strength of his spiritual
position. Only a gentleman ! gifted with the
grace of high culture and real religious
feeling.

It is, however, with his social status and
his social career only, that we have to do in
these chronicles of life at Atherton Towers.

He has been the Bishop's chaplain for three
years now ; and other men, interested in the
question, in the diocese, are beginning to say
that his chances of a good living from his
diocesan are going off rapidly. For Miss
Templeton has visibly cooled towards him
recently, and it is tacitly understood that
the best living in the Bishop's gift will
go to the successful clerical wooer of the
Bishop's daughter.

Other chaplains had come and gone before
him, but something had always intervened

between themselves and the means of obtaining
the coveted promotion. In two
cases it had been a wife and several
children. In another, a band of hopeless,
helpless, penniless sisters. But Mr. Grove
had come upon the stage free from all
encumbrances, and the heart of the Bishop's
daughter had gone out to him gladly. Unfortunately,
as far as regards his chances of
getting the best living; in the diocese, he had
not responded with flattering celerity.

But after a time, she, showing him her
liking in a thousand undemonstrative ways,
he, being only a man, began to be moved
to regard her in the light of, at least, a
warm and dear friend. The constant daily
intercourse gradually melted the bulwark of
indifference behind which he had found
safety at first, and when once she had compelled
him to feel that she was both pretty
and pleasant, and, moreover, very partial to
himself, the rest was easy.

It certainly would have ended in his
marrying her, and thus getting that good
living of which mention has been made,

had not a check been given to the completion
of the half-formed scheme by an
unintentional outsider.

Things are in this state of check now, and
have been ever since Lord Marcus Boyne
came so blithely within the borders of
AUerton Towers. For Miss Templeton is
quite as well posted up in the probabilities
of Lord Marcus succeeding' to the title and
estates of his father as Mrs. Heatherley is.
Accordingly, the cool, well-regulated pulses
of the Bishop's daughter cease to beat for
the man who never can make her more
than a rector's  perhaps a rich rector's 
wife, and throb with amiably selfish tenderness
for the handsome boy who can make
her a marchioness.

Fanny Templeton is, perhaps, as cautious a
girl as ever guided herself through the intricate
ways of good society. But there are
times when her over-caution, combined with
that high estimate of her own charms which
so nearly approaches vanity, betrays that
which she most ardently desires to conceal

It is so now, and though she his never >o

much as mentioned Lord Marcus's name to
Mr. Grove, that gentleman knows as well as
she does herself that the woman who was
ready to be his wife only the other day, is
now even readier to be the wife of the boy
who has the pleasure-loving desire to taste
all that is sweetest, as well as the brilliancy
of the butterfly.

Mr. Grove sees and admits this, and is, to
tell the truth, not very much piqued at it.
His feeling for the lady, who has been using
her womanly wiles to win him, is not sufficient
for resentment to take the place of the
liking she herself planted. Accordingly, he
makes no change in his manner of treating
her, with the kindly intention of showing her
that he has no manner of objection to her
carrying her new point  if she can ! And
she misconstrues this considerate thoughtfulness
of his, and thinks that he is determined
to consider their relations unchanged, and
fears she may have some difficulty in getting
rid of him without the shadow of a scandal
should she succeed with Lord Marcus.

On the other hand, she does not deem it

wise to burn her boats. To be quite off with
the old love before she is on with the new, is
a weak policy according to her ideas. So she
puts her manner into the scales with her
chances, and as these latter go up and
down, so shall the former vary delicately
and safely.

It is grievous to Miss Templeton that the
Fatherless should be here on this, the first
day of Lord Marcus's dining with them, but
it is better to have him with them than not
to have him at all. Besides, Ethel Heath erle
is engaged, and though she believes Ethel to
be quite as capable of being off with the old
love if a satisfactory new one appears on the
horizon as she is herself, still she will make
Lord Marcus feel that Ethel is devoted to her
lover, if the English language can do it.

Through the whole of the day she has
successfully evaded a tete-astute with Mr. Grove,
little suspecting that he has not made the
slightest attempt to have one with her. On
other sultry summer days,, such as this, it had
been her wont after she has seen her housekeeper
and ordered the domestic doings for

the day, to go out on the velvet lawn through
which the river runs, and over which the
grand cathedral casts its dignified shadow,
and spend the hours till luncheon. For the
Bishop's study window peeps out through an
ivy screen upon this lawn, and when the
Bishop and his chaplain have transacted their
morning's business of seeing suppliant clergy,
and answering a budget of supplicating, rebuking,
or defiant letters from others, what
more natural than that the younger man
should get himself out into the fresh air
under the waving trees, and glance through
the magazines and new publications with
which Miss Templeton always sedulously
provides herself?

But the " old order change ! " This
morning there is no lady on the lawn ready
to look up  with a smile playing over the
softly-tinted rounded cheeks, and the prettily
cut pink lips  at his approach. Nevertheless,
Mr. Grove takes his accustomed seat with the
air of one who is perfectly satisfied with
things as they are, and reads a couple of stiff
articles in The Fortnightly right through,

without stopping to give one thought to the
one who is fancying that her current course
of conduct is giving him pain, and causing
him bewilderment.

When the time comes for him to knoAv it,.
he shall not have it to say that I misled
him for a moment after I began to care for
Marcus," Miss Templeton says to herself,
complaisantly ; and she really credits herself
with holding rather exalted sentiments, and
with acting in an irreproachable manner.

In the afternoon it is her custom to drive
with her father for two hours, and often,
Avhen any of the country magnates are to be
honoured with a call, Mr. Grove accompanies
them. Indeed, the city of AUerton Towers
itself is rarely honoured by the presence of its-bishop,
and the city clergy are never invited
to partake of the hospitality of the palace '
Why this should be is not clear to the secular
mind, which does not understand why this
delicate line should be drawn between the
cathedral and the city clergy, or why a faint
show of the episcopal favour should be extended
to the country rectors and vicars

which is withheld from their brothers in the
town. But, as Miss Templeton says of herself,
she never does anything without a
motive, and Miss Templeton is the daughter
of her father.

On this exceptional day, however. Miss
Templeton does not second even with a look
the Bishop's suggestion that Mr. Grove shall
drive out with them to Collingham, five miles
from Atherton Towers, to look at a newly-erected
church which the Bishop is to consecrate
during the ensuing week. On the
contrary, she puts on a look of filial solicitude,
and exclaims almost tearfully against
the gentle exertion which her father is
contemplating.

The effort of getting into this room was
almost too much for you this morning, papa,"
she says ; and then, for the first time this day,
she lifts her lashes, and looks Mr. Grove in
the face.

I am sure you agree with me that it
would be injudicious in the extreme on papa's
part to venture out, with his left foot swollen
as it is ? " she says, appealingly ; and Mr.

Grove replies with an air of good-humoured
indifference that makes her fear he is going
to obtusely disregard her change of feeling
respecting him.

I am sure that the Bishop can settle that
question for himself; but as regards my going
with you, my lord, I shall ask you to excuse
me to-day ? "

Certainly ; but I thought it would have
been well for you to find out what they mean
to do at Collingham on the fifteenth," the
Bishop says, testily. The vicar of Collingham
is believed to be as much in favour of advanced
ritual as his Bishop is opposed to it.
And it adds to all the gouty symptoms,
this lurking fear that his lordship has, that
he may be surprised into sanctioning the
coloured vestments and other things which
are abominable in his eyes, if his chaplain
does not reconnoitre the dubious ground
beforehand.

I think I may safely say that everything
is sure to be done decently and in order at
Collingham on the fifteenth," Mr. Grove says,
speaking far too cheerfully and approvingly

VOL. I. D

of that local head-centre of good churchmanship,
his broad Bishop thinks.

"I specially wished to go to-day," the
Bishop says, repining ; and his daughter
puts in 

Dear papa, don't you think it would be
better to keep away from Collingham till the
day? You can't stand altercation on any
subject, and if Mr. harcourt means to make a
fight for certain things of which 3:'ou so
properly disapprove, won't it be easier for
you to put it down with authority on the day
when your presence is essential, than to
quibble about it beforehand? I am sure you
think I am rifr]it?"she adds, turning  with
a pathetic look of reliance on his always
thinking lier that, at least  to Mr. Grove.

I think you're admirably prudent and
perfectly right if you wish to save the Bishop
from being troubled," Mr. Gi-ove sap's, cheerfully
; and again Fanny tells herself that the
poor fellow is blinding himself to her change
of feeling, and that it will be a heavy trial to
her bye-and-bye to make him understand that
she has altered." But vnen as she tells herself

this, she cannot help seeing that Mr-grove
is very unconcerned, not to say indifferent,
about missing the opportunity of
driving with her this afternoon.

The end of it is that the Bishop, rendered
litigious by the absence of his chaplain and
the presence of his daughter, in an absent
mood, goes out to Gillingham, and finds fault,
that he feels to be uncalled for, with most of
the arrangements which the vicar has made
for the fifteenth. So the pebble thrown into
the social pool, innocently enough, by Lord
Marcus Boyne, is making rapidly widening
circles.

Out on the lawn while they are away this
afternoon, the chaplain sits reading, and now
and aiijain reviewing the situation.

"Poor old fellow!  he hasn't been taught
yet that I am to be petted no longer," he half
laughs to himself, and then for a few minutes
he does seriously consider whether or not
Fanny Templeton is the kind of woman whom
it would be well for him to make his wife?
After a brief period, he says, with an air of
relief, " Well ! she has settled it easily for me,

D 2

as it happens ; it might have been, if it
hadn't been for this young fellow's opportune
appearance : as it is !  I hope, for old time's
sake, she won't make a fool of herself ; Marcus
Boyne is a mere boy, and will regard her as
an old woman."

When the Bishop and his daughter come
back from Collingham they find Mr. Grove
ready to welcome them with unusual impressiveness.


Such capital news I have had by the five
o'clock post," he says, with animation, " my
old friend, Colereigh, has been offered a
colonial Bishopric  Fitz-Spitzburg  somewhere
up the South African diamond fields, I
fancy ; he's coming over to see me before he
goes : I shouldn't wonder if he wants me to
go with him."

"They're giving these colonial bishoprics to
the wrong men," the Bishop says, testify, "we
ought to send out men of moderate views, not
those who offer themselves as violent contrasts
to those of us at home who like to go on
quietly, and are averse to ceremonial."

"Some of those at home go on so quietly

that the heathen might be forgiven for
imagining that sleep and sloth in religious
matters were the things needful," Mr. Grove
replies, and Fanny says, hastily 

Missionary work would suit you I'm sure;
you like roughing it and opposing people ;
now for my part I feel that I could only be
good in an atmosphere of peace."

(she fears I may ask her to go with me,
poor girl ! " the chaplain thinks.)

Lord St. Just takes Miss Templeton in to
dinner this night, in the order of things. He
is a pleasant old gentleman  when he has
been kept away from strong waters for some
hours  full of scientific information, which he
is willing to impart to anybody who listens to
him with appreciative understanding, but
rather apt to relapse into a grimly-smiling,
and silently-ironical frame of mind, when his
words of wisdom are not waited upon. This
is the case now, for on Miss Templeton's other
side is Lord Marcus Boyne, separated by some
two others on the same side of the table from
Ethel Heatherley.

He shall not even see her during dinner,"

the astute hostess has declared ; " aud I shall
interest him sufficiently to make him come tome
instead of to her in the evening."

If Miss Templeton were quite candid she
would confess to herself that by " interesting
him " she means that she hopes " to disgust
him with Ethel," by speaking of the latter's
engagement to Mr. Gilford, " one of the town
surgeons."

rim.

im

I SHALL NEVER Forget YOU ; NEVER ! "

T was touch-and-go whether I came 
night or not ; I'd made an engagement,
before I had your invitation, to
go with some fishermen, and see what they
call a seine drawn : I forgot that, you see,
when I said I would dine here, and to-night I
forgot I Alas coming here, and was going off
with them, when Mrs. Townley charged at me
with a rebuke and a reminder."

Lord Marcus makes this unflattering confession
with a candid coolness that disarms
Miss Templeton's resentment. It is not a
difficult task for a woman who wishes to be a
marchioness to pardon a small slight from the
man who may make her one.

"Oh! it's so dangerous going out with the
seine; I should have been dismal all the
evening if you had forgotten us for the iisli,"
Miss Templeton says, pathetically.

I wouldn't regret the fish for a moment,
if you had. put me next to, or opposite to,
that lovely Miss Heatherley," he replies,
ungratefully.

Miss Templeton presses her lips a trifle
closer together, and lowers her eye-lashes
for a moment. Then she lifts the cloudless,
blue eyes with a smile, and says :

Perhaps you would have found her
even a duller companion than you are
finding me, she is not like the same girl
she was before her engagement ; so dreadfully
engrossed with thoughts of the absent
love, that she is almost useless now in
society."

It is not really an engagement, is it ? "
Lord Marcus asks, kindling to the topic.

It is, indeed, a real engagement, and it
will be quite a love match, in spite of all
her mother's machinations," Miss Templeton
laughs. " Poor Mrs. Heatherley ! her own
day is done, and she may easily be forgiven
for being a little disappointed at Ethel's having
fallen so desperately in love with a man who
hasn't much of a home, and no position whatever

to offer her ; but Ethel will have her
own way in this as in other things."

Lord Marcus fixes his sparkling eyes on her,
With a serious expression in them, which
gives a new charm to his boyish, handsome
face, and is  silent.

There is a little awkwardness in renewing
the conversation, as he will not aid her ; but
she is equal to the task, for she has a few
more shots to fire.

For my own part, I am glad it is
settled so, for I am very fond of Ethel," she
begins, looking fondly down the table at Miss
Heatherley's profile. " I'm very fond of her,
very; but she has been such a silly little,
easy-dazzled, little flirt, that it is a comfort
to know" she is settled at last with a man who
is able to take care of her."

I think she can take care of herself."

Miss Templeton laughs and shakes her head.

She's only a little rustic after all, you
know ; poor Mrs. Heatherley gives herself
dreadful airs  to a great extent, I fear, because
we have noticed them a good deal  but
Ethel knows nothing of society ; if it had not

been for this marriage (Lord Marcus winces)
I should have had her in town with me next
season "

What a stir she'd have made," he murmurs
with enthusiasm, " she is prettier than
the prettiest woman I saw at the princess's
ball just before I came down, and all the
beauties who are in the best swim were
there."

"It will not be much use for a country
surgeon's wife to make a stir in the ' best
swim'" Miss Templeton says, coldly. Then
she remembers Lord St. Just's claims on her,
and tries to give her undivided attention to
him for five minutes, hoping that Lord Marcus
Boyne will feel punished by her neglect.

Lord St. Just has taken sufficient wine
at this juncture to make him feel bitter
about having been debarred fi'om speaking of
his favourite hobby for so long a time.
Accordingly he is not in charity with anyone,
least of all with the man who has been
preferred to him by this one socially legal
auditor.

Is that longfellow as witless as his

brother Kenmare, that you have to waste
so many words in making him understand
that he's not to cast his eyes at pretty Miss
Heatherley," he says, sardonically, and Miss
Templeton could eat him as she feels that
Lord Marcus hears the speech and is amused
by it.

Pretty Miss Heatherley is so hopelessly
attached to her rather rough hero, that I have
no need to caution Lord Marcus against
falling into the pit which her ambitious
mamma is quite prepared to dig for him,"
Fanny says, presently, and Lord St. Just
gnashes his teeth and smiles, and compliments
Miss Templeton on that ' well-known
engineering skill which will doubtless enable
her to undermine Mrs. Heatherley."

All this time she has nearly forgotten Mr.
Grove, who is down at the other end of the
table, near enough to the Bishop to come to
the rescue should this lordship uuAvarily fall
into any theological difficulties. There is a
good deal of excitement frequently about this
task of extricating the Bishop, for he is apt
to force, at times, that he has solemnly

pledged himself to the rigorous observance of
certain forms and ceremonies, which occasionally
he denounces as " puerile, childish,
popish, and altogether abominable.' The
duty of figuratively picking his lordship
up, setting him erect before the Church and
the world, and saving him from falling into
unconscious heresy, is ofttimes a hard one.
But Mr. Groves does his best to perform it,
and his best is the work of a churchman, a
gentleman, and a peacemaker.

He has been having a hard time of it
during this dinner, for Bingham is on the
tapis and the Bishop, supported by some recently
delivered judgments, is as a lion on
the subject of one or two things that will
give him extra trouble if he does " not stamp
them out," as he vehemently expresses the
operation he proposes to himself. To revise,
cancel some portion of, and generally edit,
the Bishop during the heat of a controversy
into which he has hurled himself unsupported
by facts, has been a sk for a Titan. But
Mr. Grove has not only undertaken it, but
actually carried it through.

And all the while he has been in this fray.
Miss Templeton deludes herself (when she has
time to think about him at all) with the idea
that he has been aching and seething at the
sight of his successful rival on her left hand.

They go  into the drawing-room presently,
and Ethel instantly finds her way to a deep
old bow window, with cushioned seats in
its recess, in a corner of the room. She
takes up her position without let or hindrance
from Fanny Templeton, for this window
is remote from the piano and other
points of general attraction in the room,
and the girl, engaged as she is, will not have
the face to seclude herself in such a corner
with a man. Miss Templeton thinks.

Fanny has found out that Lord Marcus is
fond of music, and sings and plays a little
himself. It is a terrible trial to her now, that
she should have disregarded the efforts her
music and singing masters made in years
gone, by, to instil something like artistic feeling
into her ; for, intuitively, she feels that Lord
Marcus will not listen tolerantly to mere
namby-pamby prettiness, such as she can

deliver. With a further pang, she reflects
that Ethel Heatherley plays the violin, and
plays it well, too, for an amateur! Blessings
from Miss Templeton for her own far-lightness
in not having asked Ethel to bring her
violin to night.

In a short time it all seems to be going
as Fanny wishes. Old Lady St. Just has got
Mrs. Heatherley well within her gossiping
clutches, so that there is nothing to be feared
from the widow, as regards the Bishop, yet
awhile. Mr. Grove is discussing the possibility
and advisability of making an underground
railway right into the heart of Dartmoor
; thus rendering access to the most
picturesque points easy, and at the same
time preserving the will aspect of the place
unimpaired. Other people have grouped
themselves together more or less uncongenial
and incongruously, and Lord Marcus
is safely landed at that bane to peace in the
majority of houses  the piano.

Mrs. Townley tells me you have such a
lovely voice, and such a perfect style*' she
says; and he laughs Inioyanlly.

"Mrs. Townley knows little of music and
less of styles. My voice is good enough as
far as nature goes, but I haven't had much
good training."

But sou will sing something to oblige us ?

It will be such a pleasure to hear you ! ( )lido

! "

She begins to pick a under of songs out

of the music-stand, but he repulses her, and

refuses them politely.

Haven't learnt one of them. Miss Templeton,
and wouldn't offend your ears by crudely
singing anything I hadn't learnt," he says,
gallantly ; but she knows that he is looking
about for Ethel as he speaks. Suddenly he
discerns Miss Heatherley, and crosses over to ,
lier leisurely, quite regardless of the expression
of mingled spite and admiration in the
blue eyes which follow him.

Wdl you play an accompaniment forme?"
he asks, gently; "twickenham Ferry;'
you know it."

"Yes, I know," she says, rising swiftly,
and coming out of the mysterious light of
the recess with a bright gladness in lier ftice

and manner that undoes all Miss Templeton's
work. "I wish I had my fiddle here," she
goes on, as she seats herself at the piano, " it
goes with the violin, oh ! so deliciously."

She seems half appealing to Miss Templeton
for an endorsement of her sentiments respecting
her beloved violin, but that lady's
heart is hardened towards her.

"A little bird has Whispered to me that Mr.
Gifford wishes your choice had fallen on any
Esther musical instrument than the violin,
Ethel ; how will he like your speaking of it
as ' your fiddle ? ' "

Ethel turns slowly to the piano, draws off
her many buttoned gloves without the
slightest sign of haste or annoyance, flutters
her small, nervous hand over the keys, and
looks up into Lord Marcus's face with a smile
for which Fanny could kill her.

Now ! " Ethel says ; and the pleased,
enamoured young fellow sings " Twickenham
Merry," to her sympathetic accompaniment, ina
way he has never sang it before  or since !

They all listen to him, and to her  spellbound,
till the last echo of the last whispering

notes die out ; then a chorus of thanks and
admiration greet both the brilliant young
performers.

In listening to the thrilling strain, the
Bishop has forgotten ColHngham and his gout,
but both are rapidly recalled to him when
his daughter crosses over, and whispers :

There is nothing in the song itself, but
the way her playing prompted him to sing it
was simply shocking ! Speak to Ethel, papa,
for her own sake ; point out the impropriety
of that daring, defiant style ; and don't hint
to her that I have asked you to do it, or the
poor, vain, silly child may think I'm jealous
of her."

So, at the bidding of his exemplary child,
the good Bishop presently calls Ethel to his
side, and unwillingly reproves her.

It's a dreadful song for that boy to have
sung in the Palace, before me," he says, as
austerely as he can bring himself to speak to
the pretty widow's prettier daughter, " and
I'm sorry to find that you are so well
acquainted with it as to be able to play it ina
way that must have shocked everybody."

' What harm is there in the song ? I'll ask
you about my playing the accompaniment
afterwards," Ethel asks, respectfully ; but
there is a light in her brown velvet eyes,
that shows she is ready for battle.

" No actual harm, but it's altogether not
quite the song for a lady or gentleman to
sing in a drawing-room before other ladies
and gentlemen."

Ladies and gentlemen listen to it delightedly
at concerts."

In private society it is not well that the
full meaning should be put either into the
words or air," the Bishop says, dictatorially ;
and then, satisfied that he has said enough to
satisfy his daughter and his conscience for the
present, he resumes his conversation with the
Townley, and leaves Ethel to reflect on his
counsels.

Humming the last two lines of the song
which has been the cause of her disgrace,
Ethel saunters away to her seat in the window
again, and there, behind the curtain, is
Lord Marcus.

I didn't see you come," she says ; and he

knows there is no girlish subterfuge here ;
she did riot see him come.

Isn't it the best place in the room ? " the
girl goes on, never lowering her voice a half-tone,
but speaking out so that all in the room
may hear if they be minded to listen. " The
view is lovely, and we needn't talk."

She plants herself on the low seat opposite
to him, and he crosses to her side
quickly.

"It is the best place in the room, for it's
the place you're in ; and I can't look at the
view, lovely as it is, while I can look at you ;
and as for one not talking, I must say something
to you. May I ? "

You say ' you must,' " she says, looking at
him with wonder in her eyes.

Well, I must. It is this : I shall never
forget you, never ! And you are engaged ? "

I am engaged to Mr. Gifford ; I told you
that myself, yesterday," she says, looking at
him too kindly.

And yesterday I heard, and didn't care
whether I believed it or not ; to-night I've
heard it again. It was dinned into my ears

K 2

all through dinner, and now I can't bear to
believe it. Do you know why ? "

Because you like me yourself, I suppose,"
the girl says, proudly ; " that's the only
reason I can think of, and I'm sorry."

Oh ! Ethel, it's because I love you," he
says, bending nearer to her  worshipping
her with the pure worship of a young
man's first passionate love  "don't be sorry
for me, whichever way it goes ; be glad,
for if I ever can gain you it will be my
life's happiness, and if I'm to lose you !
Well ! be. glad I have loved you, won't
you?"

You'll forget me and your fancy in a
week," Ethel says ; and she tries to say it
steadily, and tries to believe that she
means it.

Forget you ! " He rises up, and stands
before her straight, erect, beautiful in his
youth and strength, and love for her.

Forget you ! Is it because I'm younger
than the man in whose love you are going to
rely that you think mine will fade? or is it
because you despise me for having been so

quickly won, that you think I shall be
lightly lost?"

No ; it's because I love the other one best
that I say you'll soon forget me ; because I
hope you will."

Best ! Then you do feel something 
liking or something for me ? " he pleads,
eagerly ; but before Ethel can answer him,
Miss Templeton dances into the recess, and
puts her hand within Ethel's arm.

I hope the others  the Townley especially
 haven't noticed this, Ethel," she whispers,
and the grip on Ethel's arm grows
vicious as she says it. Then she adds aloud
to Lord Marcus :

"Mr. Townley has said good-night to us,
and the carriage is at the door ; do you go
with them?"

No. I shall walk home to-night," he
says, gloomily.

Walk ! impossible ! it's five miles. Stay
here, my father will be most happy if you
will, I am sure ; if you are determined not to
drive."

Thanks, Miss Templeton, but to stay here

would be more impossible still ; in the first
place I have no clothes with me, and in the
second place "

"What?"

I have no inclination to stay without
them," he says, lazily ; and then lie takes
Ethel's hand, and mutters "good-night" to her.

Good-night, good-bye," Ethel says, rather
chokingly ; it is a bit of romance, and she
rather likes it. Still she thinks it would be
well to end it !  while yet there is time !

It isn't ' good-bye, ' " Lord Marcus says,
impetuously ; " it can't be that  when you're
the one person in the world I want to see
again."

He wrings her hand, and something in the
strong grasp impresses her with the truth
and reality of what he has been saying to her.
Aid she cannot but be pitiful towards the
man who has given his love to her so unreservedly
and quickly, and to whom lie
feels convinced she can never give her love
in return.

As soon as he is gone Miss Templeton
drops her mask of sweetness.

Ethel ! " she begins, in a tone of reprobation
; " you have been more than fooHsh tonight
; even papa spoke of the way in which
you played just now, so professional and
showy, not at all what we-could have wished
to hear in our drawing-room ; and then, to
cap such an exhibition, you retire into a
dark corner with a young man who is a
stranger, and flirt with him in a way that
must have amused him."

Ethel's eyes flash in the growing darkness
" Don't call me ' Ethel ' when you speak tome
in that way, Miss Templeton, or rather
never speak to me again till you can remember
that I am neither your dependent nor
your servant, but your equal ; and as for
your father's opinion of my manner of playing,
you worded it for him, and made him
say it, because you knew Lord Marcus sang
the song as if he loved it simply because I
played it for him,"

Oh, Ethel ! " Miss Templeton cries, desperately,
feeling that if she has driven Ethel
into (open rebellion, the girl will hold no
terms, will keep no covenant.

"I am 'Miss Heatherley' to you, if you
please, until you tell me you are sorry for
having insulted me," the girl cries, passionately.
"Wasn't it bad enough to be
tempted "

She checks herself abruptly, walks like a
queen into the lighted room, and bending
over lier mother, whispers, " We have stayed
too late, mother dear ! come ! "

A.

w

IS SHE JEALOUS?

jiT is the morning after the dinner at the

Palace, and Ethel Heatherley is out in

the garden at the back of her mother's

pretty cottage, alone with thoughts that are

not pleasant.

She cannot help admitting to herself that
she did like that brief, spasmodic bit of
romance which flashed into her life so unexpectedly
on the previous evening. She
liked it at the time, and remembers it with
blushes and pride, and pleasure now. And
for doing this she knows she ought to be
thoroughly ashamed of herself, for the man
whom she is pledged to marry has announced
that he is coming to have a serious talk with
her this morning, and he is not the man who
has temporarily glorified existence for her
with this Hash of bright romance.

I shall never forget you, never ! " she

keeps on repeating to herself, but, do all
she can, she fails to utter the words with
that drawing sweetness which had been in
his tones dien he uttered them. Did he,
could he mean them ? She hopes not ; iov
of course she is engaged to Walter, and she
loves him dearly, and wouldn't do anything
but marry him for the world. Still, did
Lord Marcus mean them ?

Marcus is a lovely name, too, she tells
herself. His name, Marcus Boyne, attracts
her more than his title, it's so Irish, and so
uncommon, and so exactly the gallant-sounding,
fitting name for so gallant-looking a
hero. How he ransj out those words 

With love like u rose at the stern of the wherry,
There's danger in rowing to Twickenham Town"'

What an old prude the Bishop was for carping
at such a sweet love-song. But no ! it
wasn't the Bishop's fault, poor old man ; it
was Fanny who had prompted her father to
find fault; it was Fanny's jealousy, the
foolish, spiteful thing ; as if he would ever
look at her, even if she, Ethel Ileatherley,
didn't exist.

Was lie fickle, as Irishmen are, proverbially?
Would he forget her, as she had
told him he would in a week ? How she
would like to test him, and find him faithful
and true ; that is to say, how she would like
to do it if Walter (dear, good Walter, who
shouldn't be snubbed for anyone) didn't exist ;
and Walter was coming in a moment, and
Lord Marcus had said he would " never forget
her, never ! "

She looks prettier this morning than she
has ever looked in her life, and somehow
or other she knoAvs that she does so, and
attributes this pleasing result rather to the
effect of the new emotions which have been
awakened in her by the brief romance of last
night, than to the deliciously-tinted pale pink
lawn dress, with its flounces and frills of
white lace. New feelings, new emotions, new
aspirations, new possibilities have entered in
and taken possession of and beautified her,
all through this bright glimpse she luis had
of an ardent's man's suddenly-developed admiration
and love.

If he could only see her this morning lie

would surely like her better than ever. If
he could only see her ! Not that she wishes
him to come, or to see her, or to think about
her any more ; but he had said he should
never forget her, never ; " and after that,
what can she do but think of him a little,
for a time at least.

She is startled out of her meditations on
this head abruptly, by a step close to her
side, a hand on her shoulder, and a voice in
her ear, saying,

Ethel, darling, I'm afraid I've kept you
waiting, but I've heard from my sister, offering
to come and stay with me ; she wants
to come at once, and to bring a friend with
her, so I've been about searching for lodgings,
and the time has slipped away without my
knowing it."

He stoops over her as he speaks, as if
to kiss her, but Ethel stands a little aloof,
not angrily, nor coldly, but just as if a kiss
from him were not in the programme at
the moment.

I didn't know you were late. I mean,
you haven't kept me waiting," Ethel says.

hurriedly, and then, seeing that Mr. Gifford
looks hurt and surprised, she tries to throw
a little extra interest into her next words.

I'm so glad your sister is coming, Walter,
it will be so nice for you. But Why are
you getting lodgings for her? Why won't
she stay with you ? "

Didn't I tell you she is bringing a friend
with her ? "

But why can't the friend stay with you,
too?"

The friend is a young lady, and it
wouldn't be quite the thing for her to stay
in a bachelor's house."

"" What nonsense ! What utter nonsense !
Not the proper thing to stay in a bachelor's
house, when the bachelor's sister is with him.
Such prudery and rubbish ! I've no doubt
she's an old maid whom you wouldn't look
at ; besides (with a gay, self-satisfied laugh),
while I am in the way she needn't be afraid
of your falling in love with her, need she ? ''

She's not an old maid," he says, with
slight embarrassment.

"Isn't she?" Ethel asks, quickly. "You

told me your sister is twenty-nine or thirty,
so I took it for granted that her friend would
be equally aged. What is her name ? Is she
pretty ? "

Very," he says, emphatically.

Oh ! "

"Very pretty, and very clever, and "

How pleased you must feel at the prospect
of welcoming her," Ethel interrupts, with
a little air of hauteur that becomes her welland
that pleases Walter Gifford, because he
fancies it betokens jealousy! Alas! for him
and his short-sightedness. Ethel's jealousy
will never bring her nearer to him. His first
instinct against the coming of his sister's
friend has been a correct one. Her presence
will bring no peace to him.

"I am not at all pleased, to tell the truth.
I wish Mabel had come by herself, and then
she could have stayed with me ; as it is, Miss
Somerset has spoilt the pleasure of my sister's
visit, as far as I am concerned."

Don't you like Miss Somerset ? "

My not wishing her to come has nothing
to do with mv likings or not likings her. I'm

annoyed because she will take Mabel into
lodgings instead of letting her come to nie,
and she will engross my sister entirely."

You either hate or love her very much,
Walter," Ethel says, gravely. " I wonder
which it is ? "

It certainly is not ' love ' that I feel for
the lady who is going to interfere with my
plans for Mabel."

Then it has been love, now, hasn't it P
If she is less than a friend to you now, it is
because she has at some period in the past
been more than a friend. Won't you trust
me and tell me, Walter? I shouldn't bethe
least bit annoyed or hurt. I'm not
silly enough to fancy that I am the only
one you have ever cared for. One can't
have one, and only one love in a life "

I hoped that I was your first love, at any
rate, Ethel ; and told myself that I had won
you utterly."

You shouldn't tell yourself anything
so foolish and dog in-the-mangerish. Why
should I only have the pleasure of being
in love once, any more than the rest of

my fellow-creatures? You've half confessed
already, at least, I've screwed it out of you,
that you have been in love with this Miss
Somerset, whatever you may be now. Why
should I be different, and vow truly that
you're the first and only one my heart has
thought of for a minute ? "

If I could think you were jealous," he
is beginning, when she laughs and stops
him.

No, no, Walter ! I'm not jealous, I'm
only glad to find that I'm not so much, so
everything to you, as I thought I was ; it
would have frightened me to feel that you
never had loved anybody, and never could
love anybody but me ; now I feel freer, oh !
ever so much freer."

I'm sorry that your assumption of facts,
that you can't verify, should give you such
liberty of conscience. Miss Somerset is no
more to me than any other person who intervenes
between me and unfettered intercourse
with my sister."

You got red about her," Ethel says,
with a lively laugh, that seems to tell him

she does not care whether he is in love with
Miss Somerset or not.

I came to speak to you about something
widely different, and that is your mother's
unjustifiable opposition to our engagement,
after having given her free consent to it."

Don't call anything my mother does or
says 'unjustifiable,' if you please."

"It is unjustifiable to profess perfect satisfaction
with a man and his prospects one
day, and then, suddenly, without any change
having taken place in either, to find fault
with both."

Mother doesn't find fault with you, as a
man."

She does with my position, and seems
to distrust my power of improving it ; and
you don't appear the least distressed at her
doing so. Why is this, Ethel? What has
happened to change you from the dear,
loving, devoted, staunch little girl you were
that day you said you would be my wife ? "
Please don't use such words and such
grand sentiments about it," Ethel says, with
unaffected distaste to the subject ; " you're

making it all big and important by the way
you speak ! Why can't you let things be ?
Why can't you drift on just as we are, contentedly,
for a little time ? "

Because I love you, Ethel, and can't see
you either taken from me, or drifting from
me, without showing the pain I feel," he
says, with emotion.

They have come away from the house,
down along the winding paths that lead
from the pretty, old-fashioned garden to the
banks of the river, as he says this ; and now
they stand in silence for a time, looking down
at the water, as it ripples and leaps now
along quiet places, and now over big boulders.
On the opposite side of the river, the Palace
grounds spread their stately, sheltered walks
and lawns, and, presently looking across,
Ethel sees, on one of these latter. Miss
Templeton sitting on a rustic bench, under
a deeply-drooping tree, looking down complacently
at a manly form reclining on the
grass at her feet.

Fanny and Mr. Grove don't often come
so far as this," Ethel is saying, when the

manly form starts to its feet, with an amount
of activity that does not characterise Mr.
Grove's movements usually, and a strong,
clear, young voice calls out,

Hold hard, there, will you, Miss Heatherley,
and I'll cross over on some of these big
stones," and Ethel recognises the form and
voice of Lord Marcus Boyne, and cannot
restrain an exclamation of glad delight as
she does recognise him.

This at the first blush of pleasure ! A
moment after she remembers that Lord Marcus
can never be anything to her, and that
her lover is by her side ! Oh ! the joy there
ought to be in such a reflection ! Oh ! the
flat pain there is in it !

(that puppy here again ! ") she hears Mr.
Gifford mutter, and she can't refrain from
saying,

He's manly and gentlemanly, and bright
and beautiful ! Why do you call him a
puppy,' Walter ? "

' Beautiful ! ' What a word to use about
a man ! One gets a contempt for the man to
whom it's applied, even if one hadn't it before."

F 2

"Why?" Ethel asks, impetuously, as she
eagerly watches Lord Marcus's perilous passage
across the boulders, over which the river
is rushing tumultuously. "Why? We use
it about a sunset, and a horse, and a mountain
; why not about a man ? "

Pshaw ! "

There's no argument against its use in
that, anyway," Ethel says, stubbornly. Then
she drops her acknowledged lover's arm,
which has been holding her tightly this while,
and goes of! to meet the unacknowledged
one, as he clambers up the bank, flushed and
dripping from his exploit.

A modern Leander ! " Miss Templeton
shouts from her dry and deserted position on
the opposite lawn ; but her spitefully suggestive
words fall on Walter Gifford's ears
only, and deeply do they aggravate him.
The others hear them not. Ethel is bending
over the bank, holding an enthusiastic hand
out to Lord Marcus, who is leaping up inmost
Leander-like fashion, quite oblivious of
the jealous glances which are being hurled at
them from either side of the bank.

I have come to tell you something'' Lord
Marcus gasps, as he reaches level land. " T
know you won't care to hear it, but, still, I
can't help wanting to tell you, and to hear
you say you're sorry for me. Kenmare 
he's my brother, you know ?  is awfully ill,
and I'm going home at once to see him ; but
I wouldn't go without saying good-bj'e to
you."

He is holding her hand, and looking into
her face with his wonderful, glistening, aquamarine
eyes, and she is tenderly touched, as it
behoves a woman to be who hears of the
sudden illness, which may possibly have a
fatal termination, of one who is dear to one
whom she loves.

Perhaps your brother Avill get better,"
she blurts out, prosaically ; " but, if you
wanted to say good-bye to me, why Avere you
lying on the lawn at Miss Templeton's
feet ? "

Because I had to take a message Iron
Townley to the Bishop ; and when I said I
was coming on l:ere to the cottage, she told
me she expected you there this morning,

and said I should miss you if I didn't
wait. Would you have been sorry ? Would
you have cared a bit, Ethel ? "

Ethel," Mr. Gifford shouts from a height
a few yards above her, looking down
with threatening eyes upon the fascinating,
frivolous pair. " Ethel, I must go in five
minutes, and I have many things to say to
you."

Why the deuce doesn't he say them and
have done with it," young Marcus Boyne
mutters to himself, discontentedly. He is
mad with fate, love, everything this morning !
and Ethel's eyes are distracting him. Why
are the " sweetest eyes that were ever seen "
predestined to light the path of another
man? Why may he not dare to ask her to
definitely break all previous bonds, and share
his fortunes with his heart to-day?

No, he cannot. There is that man on the
little winding path above them proclaiming
his rights in the cold, cavilling, displeased
tone in which he says 

Ethel, I must go in five minutes."

Wearily, Ethel begins to ascend the winding

path. What is she to say to Walter Gifford
when she rejoins him ? Nothing ; absolutely
nothing ! She cannot thank him for waiting
for her, for she has not wanted him to wait !
She cannot profess to think that he will be
glad to see Lord Marcus Boyne, because she
knows that the young man's name is <-is the
root of bitterness to him ! And if she does
not do either of these things, Walter may be
righteously annoyed.

Why, oh why, has any one but mother
the right to control me or find fault with
me ? " she says to herself, as she plods up the
path. Lord Marcus affectionately at her heels.
Then she meets Walter Gifford, and must say
something.

You don't know one another, I find ?
Mr. Gifford, let me introduce you to Lord
Marcus Borne ; now come in and see
mother," she adds, with an air of relief, turning
towards Lord Marcus.

And you stay here with me," Walter
Gifford puts in, decisively.

She looks from one to the other for a
moment, and then makes up her mind that

she cannot even seem to slight the man who
is in sorrow about his brother.

Lord Marcus's will be rather a sad goodbye,
Walter," she says, gently ; " you are
going to see your sister and her friend, who
are both full of spirits and life ; he is going
to his dying brother. I think I must stay
with him and mother."

Walter Gifford stands back and folds his
arms over his chest. In that moment he
comes to a definite conclusion concerning
the part he will play in this drama. Ethel
shall go her own way for a year. At the
end of that year he will either have the
power to control her, or the will to resist
her ! What matter which ? She shall go
her own way now.

It must be as you please," he says, inclining
his head, and Ethel lifts her bonnie,
blooming face towards him and answers 

"My pleasure is that you go and enjoy
yourself with your sister and Miss Somerset,
for a time, and leave me to mother ! Now,
you can't say Tm nasty, and exacting, and
jealous."

"I wish to Heaven you were," he says,
piteously, but she is not listening to him.
She is already running up the winding path,
with Lord Marcus by her side.

The young Irishman has all his woman-worshipping
wits about him, for all the real
trouble he is in about his brother.

I knew it was on the cards that you
couldn't or wouldn't see me if I came," he
says, with that bewitching humility which
more than other form of pride compels a
woman to surrender ; " but still, I thought
I'd come and ask for your sympathy, thigh
you can't give me your "

"Oh! don't, don't." They are in the
clematis-covered entrance-porch to the cottage
now  a little place  the interior of which is
a mass of tea-roses, stephanotis, gardenia, and
giant mignonette.' It is all so sweet that fora
few moments poor Ethel feels sweetly
astray. Then she recovers herself.

I wish Mr. Gifford had come with us,"
she says, rather mournfully.

"If he had I shouldn't be here now,"
Lord Marcus cries. Then he goes down on

one knee before her, and she can but hear
what he has to say.

Ethel, I love you, I love you ; whatever
comes, I shall come back and tell you so ;
Ethel, you are my star ! Guide me back to
you soon ; forgive me for saying this now
when he's here, and I oughtn't to say it, but
I'm unhappy about my brother, and I want
someone to love me. I mean I want to tell
someone all about myself and what's before me."

Ethel is leaning back against a shelf, her
hands behind her, tightly clasping it, and he
is standing before her, grief-stricken, bewilderingly
handsome, and utterly oblivious
of the fact that the man she is pledged to
marry is standing a few yards away from
them, anathematising him.

In response to his ardent appeal, Ethel,
with the instinct for self-preservation which
is inherent in her sex, says nothing ; but
moves discreetly towards the inner hall,
cooing out as she moves,

Mother ! mother ! we want you ! Are
you not down yei, darling ? " and presently
Mrs. Heatherley appears, all India muslin

and sarah, and soft laces, looking lier freshest,
sweetest, airiest morning self in fact, and,
as with a quick glance she takes in the
whole situation (for Walter Gilford is looming
gloomily in the background), Ethel
feels that the onus is off her !

Mother will manage them both'" she
says to herself, with a sensation of relief,
for it has not come to the pass yet, with
her, that she desires to manage either of
them apart from " mother."

My dear boy," Mrs. Heatherley says,
quiveringly, presently, when she has heard
the reason why he has been recalled home,
my heart bids me go and help to nurse
your brother ; but my motives might be
misconstrued if I volunteered for the service !
What say you? Shall I go?"

For a moment Lord Marcus thinks of his
motherless, dying brother, away in the
imposing but exceedingly ill-regulated Irish
castle, and is half inclined to accept the
Quixotic offer. The next he looks at
Ethel's face, and reads her look of pained,
scornful disapproval aright.

I aren't ask you, though I'd give all
I have, or may have, in the world to get
you and Ethel there," he says, with unwonted
trembling and hesitation in his
voice and manner. And Mrs. Heatherley
looks at him with tears of maternal understanding
in her eyes, and Ethel turns away
hastily, and gets out to look for Walter
Gifford.

He is just about to depart when she
comes, and it is in his heart to punish her
for having been so long.

"I had a hundred things to say to you,
Ethel ; but you have been so much taken
up with Lord Marcus, that I must put
them off till the evening."

Or till another day  say till you've
found lodgings for your sister and Miss
Somerset," she says, calmly.

Ethel ! don't send me off like this ! and
don't be dazzled by that boy."

"That ' boy,' as you call him, is not in the
dazzling ' line of business, at present. Hein
grief, real grief, about his brother
Kenmare.'

If Kenmare dies, he will be the Marquis.
His grief is as real as all else about him,"
Walter GifFord storms out ; and Ethel can
only say,

Walter ! how can you say it ? "

t

entp:r lily, exit ethel.

pORE than a week has elapsed, Mr
' GifFord has found the most comfortable
and picturesque lodgings
for his sister and her friend that the heart
of woman can desire, or the most exacting and
fastidious nature of man can desire for her.

Three lavender-scented rooms in a sweet
farm-house, called " The Uplands," are placed
at their service by one of the bonniest-faced
housewives in the West counties.

Three old, raftered rooms, low and roomy,
with quaint corner cupboards full of china,
and long, queerly carved settles, along the
walls. Rooms that are full of the sweetness
and light of the country, and, it may be told
here, rooms into which Lily Somerset would
rather die than enter, if she too had not an
end to gain.

For she is one of the world's spoilt darlings,

and for her " to rough it " in ever so
slight a degree, is an extraordinary thing.
It is the mornings after their arrival at the

o

Uplands  the farm-house that lies on the
breezy borders of Atherton Towers  and the
two ladies are sitting at their rather late
breakfast, in the old oak-panelled, low-raftered
sitting room which has been placed at their
service.

Anything more incongruous than these two
friends are in appearance, manners, motives,
habits, and aspirations, cannot well be imagined.
Mabel Gifford is a tall, stout, good-humoured,
commonplace-looking woman of
thirty, full of thriftiness, and excellent household
ways, blessed with an eagle's eye for the
main chance. Not a mean woman! Far be
it from the chronicler of this portion of her
blameless, uneventful career, to suggest that
Mabel GifFord is endowed, in ever so slight a
degree, with the quality of meanness. But
essentially a thrifty, careful, saving Avoman,
who, abhorring every form of luxury and
extravagance for herself, is rather apt to be
intolerant of it in others.

Yet, see her now, the chosen friend and
companion of Lily Somerset, a girl of four-ands
twenty, whose fortunes are as fair as her
most lovely face  a girl who has never known
what it is to " deny herself anything that
money can purchase, or which she has set her
heart upon having  a girl to whom fine raiment
is absolutely one of the chief necessaries
of life, who invariably averts her eyes from
the seamy side of everything, and who feels
it rather hard that some one cannot bribe the
sun to perpetually shine upon her  a self-indulgent,
wilful, capricious, extravagant,
exacting, ungrateful young lady, yet one for
whom Mabel Gifford is willing to sacrifice her
time, principles, occupations, sharply-defined
rules of life, and personal independence.

She does not puzzle her head much by
trying to define the reason why she has gone
into this bondage to one who, she feels dimly,
will cast her off and do without her very
buoyantly as soon as she no longer needs her.
It is enough for Miss Gifford, who has no
charms, no caprices, and but a very narrow
fortune of her own, to shine in the reflected

light of this glittering fairy queen, who is as
fair, slender, graceful, and sweet to look upon
as the lily whose name she bears.

Miss Somerset is lying back in the most comfortable
chair in the room, her long morning
gown of cream Madras muslin and lace floating
away in soft folds around her fragile figure.
Her beautifully shod diminutive feet are stuck
up on a chair in front of her. A cup of chocolate
is frothing on the table by her side, and
Miss Gilford is just engaged in the critical task
of selecting; the daintiest bit of sweetbread in
the dish, wherewith to tempt her (Lily's) fitful
appetite.

Put your hat on, Mabel, and go at once,"
Miss Somerset is saying, after there has. been
a short pause in the conversation.

Yes, dear. Go where ? " Miss Gilford replies,
acquiescently, but vaguely.

"To your brother, of course. Oh, I forgot
you didn't know what I have been thinking
about. I have just made up my mind that I
won't touch a thing, not a single thing, for
breakfast, until I know what Mr. Gilford means
by treating me in this exceedingly rude manner."

VOL. I. o

Rude, my dear ! Walter rude to you !
He couldn't be."

"It's bearish of him not to have come to
inquire for me this morning, after that hideous
journey yesterday; and I will not be treated
with churlish discourtesy by any man, least of
all by Walter Gifford. He inst come, and
make something like an apology to me, before
I touch anything this morning ; and if I go
without my chocolate, I'm always ill, as you
know ; so go at once, please."

Mabel Gifford rises promptly, and puts on
her hat ; but she sighs as she does it, for she
knows that her task is a hopeless one, and
that when lie comes back with it unfulfilled,
her loved tyrant will make her suffer for her
inability to perform it.

You must remember that Walter's time
is not his own," she says, feebly.

Then pray who's is it ? " Lily retorts,
imperiously.

Well, a doctor, you know, must consider
his patients before even his friends," Miss
Gifford says, humbly.

I will not have his patients considered

before me, and he would never be fool enough
to tell me that he does so," Lily says, with
smiling derision. " You are blundering, as
usual, you good, awkward old Mab, in your
efforts to defend your brother ; you had much
better simply do as I tell you  go and tell
him he must come at once. Leave the work
of explanation to him."

It is in Miss Gifford's mind to say, " Time
was when Walter would have left every
patient in the world for your sake, and then
you drove him from you." But she does not
say it, for it is the fondest desire of her heart
that these two shall come together again, and
she humbly acknowledges that she is not
gifted with the grace of uttering those seasonable
words which may bring this desirable
end about.

The young surgeon's house is in one of the
most picturesque quarters of the old city, but
the distance between it and the Uplands farmhouse,
where the two ladies are lodging, is as
wide as Walter has been able to make it.
His sister's feet grow tired, and her soul grows
sad as she walks it rapidly this morning, for

G 2

she detects a meaning in his having placed
them so far away.

He doesn't want to be in the way of
seeing her often, I'm afraid," Mabel soliloquises,
shaking her head. " And I really do
believe, now, that she's got to be fond of him,
and finds she can't do without him ; what a
thiuCT it would be for dear Walter. Five
thousand a year, and no one to interfere with
the way she spends it ! There'd be an end of
all the working and scraping and toiling, and
being beaten back by richer men, who can
afford to make more flourish about what they
do, if Walter will only love and trust her again."

.Walter is just coming out of his surgery
door, into the yard, where his stanhope is
waiting for him. The stanhope " looks prosperous,"
Mabel thinks, for it is well built and
well kept, and the big, powerfully modelled
bay horse that stands between the shafts hasa
satisfactory air of sleekness about him, that
reassures his owner's sister. Still ! " It is
hard work, grinding work, for poor Walter to
keep things up to the mark, I know," his sister
thinks, pityingly, as she steps across the

yard towards liii. Then in a moment it
flashes across her, that he may be Lily
Somerset's husband, and the master of five
thousand a year, if he pleases, and her pity
resolves itself into a sensible, practical, earnest
desire and intention, to see that he uses this
opportunity aright.

"You moving at this hour, after your journey,
Mabel," he says, addressing her in cheerful
accents, though he has no cheerfulness in
his heart, for he has not seen Ethel since that
day when he left her pouring out pity, that
seemed to him misapplied, for Lord Marcus
Boyne, about his brother Lord Kenmare.
How, therefore, should cheerfulness and himself
be " on terms " just now ?

Yes, Walter, and I'm here without having
had any breakfast, let me tell you," Mabel
says, querulously, and then, as she sees that he
is about to step into his stanhope, she makes
a sudden step forward, lays her hand on his
arm, and arrests his further progress.

You must come back with me, Walter.
Lily is  is hurt that you haven't been over
already; you'll come back with me now?"

Walter Gifford slowly takes out a notebook
of imposing proportions, and reads a
list of cases and the hours which he is bound
to give to them.

You see, Mabel, I have no time to give
to you this morning," he says, as he closes
the note-book.

Not to me, but to hei" his sister pleads
with unconscious pathos.

Nonsense, dear old girl." He speaks
with affected unconcern and indifference, but
within he is terribly moved. Why cannot
this Syren cease to lure him now, when he
is so nearly safely anchored in a far more
holy love ? Why cannot she cease to strive
to distract him ? Why cannot she cease to
be herself, in fact?

Nonsense, dear old girl ; my time is not
my own. Present my compliments to Miss
Somerset, and tell her that if she gets bilious
or neuralgic down here, I will come to her at
once, in pursuit of my calling ; but while she
is well and happy, she does not need me, and
other people do."

He steps up into his stanhope as he speaks,

and his sister imjerils all lier limbs in striving
to follow him.

But, Walter ! do listen ! "

Brightly he leans forward, holding the
reins, and looking horribly ready to drive
over her, she thinks.

"I am listening."

Think, Walter ; think of what I shall
have to endure when I go back without you !
Lily is nervous this morning ; take her as one
of the patients whom you will not neglect."

As his sister says this, Mr. Gifford thinks of
Ethel, the girl he loves and longs to marry ;
of Ethel, the girl who seems so heartily disinclined
to marry him just at present Then
across the thought of her, comes another
thought  a thought, lightning-like, of Lily,
who is all flush and glow, and passionate
resolve !

With all my heart, I wish Miss Somerset
had selected another spot to recover her
faded health in, and another medical adviser
than myself ; understand me, Mabel ! I will
not help Lily out in another sham ! tell her
so from me."

If I dared to do it, she would be sitting
in your surgery when you came home today.
Walter, be sensible, be led by Lily
and me."

Led ! to what ? "

To be Avhat you wanted to be once to
her. Oh, Walter, do listen, think of her
beauty, and sweetness, and money ; think ! "

Of their all beings the devil's snares
for me, and of how I won't be snared""
he said, coldly ; " go back to your friend,
Mabel, and tell her that T know now what
self-preservation means ; I shall not leave
my duty at lier bidding."

"And she won't touch a bit of breakfast till
she sees you," Mabel pleads, as she sees the
chances of her mission ending successfully
fading away.

Then I fear she will not breakfast to-days"'
he laughs, " for when I come back from my
rounds, I am due at Mrs. Heatherley's."

*who is Mrs. Heatherley?"

She is Ethel's mother, and Ethel is the
girl I hope to make my wife."

"Walter!"

Why this announcement ? "
I have never even heard of her."
No ; I have kept my heart's darling very
close," he says, meditatively.

Are 5ou teasing and trying me ? I hope
you are, Walter, for rather than go back and
repeat what you have just said, as a truth,
to Lily, I would  I don't know where I
wouldn't go."

Come up and have a quiet talk with
me this evening, Mabel," he answers, for
his sister's manner and appearance is too
flustered and heart-rending altogether for
him to hold further converse with her
now. A strong, brawny woman dissolved in
tears is a sight to make even strong men
shudder and depart from it ; they themselves
being the cause of the unseemly emotion
being the more cogent reason why they are
intolerant of it.

If this is what I have come to AUerton
Towers for, I could almost wish I had stayed
at home, though for months it has been the
dearest wish of my heart to see you, Walter,"
Miss Gifford says, half to her brother and half

to herself, as he drives away, and leaves her
ill the full morning light, clearly outlined and
very warm, in his stable yard.

Presently, stepping daintily and tenderly
across the paving stones, there comes a delicate
little lady, vigorously dressed in raiment
of the most gossamer-like grey. Intuitively,
Miss Gifford feels that this is an antagonist,
and when with a pardoning smile the transparent
intruder addresses her, the substantial
sister feels that Walter's path may be beset
with other snares than his own untoward will.

' lias Mr. Gilford gone? Ah! how unfortunate
I am, to be so late," the pretty little
lady in grey exclaims, disconsolately, and a
conviction starts through Mabel's mind, that
this can be no other than the Mrs. Heatherley
to whom Walter has declared he is due as
soon as he has finished his rounds.

My brother is gone for several hours, I
believe," Miss Gifford says, frigidly, and
Mrs. Heatherley, with eyes wide open with
perplexity and friendly feeling, murmurs :

"Your brother; is it possible? I am
delighted to meet such a sister of Mr.

GifFord's, for I take a deep interest in him,
and have so often wished that he had a
wise sister near him."

I am the only sister he has, and I am
near enough to him now," Mabel says,
fluently. " As to my wiseness ! we won't
say about that at present  as 3'ou are such
a friend of Walter's, I may venture to ask
your name."

"Oh! I am Mrs. Heatherley," the fair little
widow says, with the prettiest air of surprise
imaginable. That anyone should be ignorant
of her name and status, is not at all in order
at AUerton Towers.

Ethel's mother ! " Miss Gifford cries, surprised
out of prudence, and Mrs. Heatherley
nods her head assenting, and says :

Yes, Ethel is the name of my child, and
now you have come, I almost regret that I
have just made arrangements for taking her
away for a time ; she is so young, and as it
is so terribly dull here, at last I have yielded
to her unspoken plea for a change ; we leave
Atherton Towers just as you come to it, Miss
Gifford; can anything be more unfortunate''

Mrs. Heatherley does not even assume the
shallow appearance of being sorry for the
combination of circumstances which she is
verbally regretting, and Mabel Giilbrd feels
her face flushing with mortification. That
Ethel's mother is no more anxious for the
engagement to last and the marriage eventually
to come off', than she herself, Walter's
sister, is, is evident to her, and it angers her
that it should be so. She can justify herself
for undervaluing and lightly regarding the
unknown Ethel. But that Mrs. Heatherley
should presume to undervalue Walter, whom
she knows, goads Walter's sister into the
utterance of words of indiscretion.

"I have just heard something from my
brother that makes me feel rather surprised
at your daughter's desire to go away from
Atherton Towers," Mabel says, stiffly ; and
Mrs, Heatherley aggravates the already
aggravated sister still further by taking
no notice of her remark.

When did you say you expected your
brother home ? I am most anxious to see
him before I go, in order that he may prescribe

for my neuralgia. You would hardly
believe it, Miss Gilford, but I am a martyr to
my nerves "

My brother will be home in the course of
two or three hours," Mabel interrupts. "Are
you leaving so suddenly that you won't wait
to see him ? "

The train will not wait for us, my
dear Miss Gilford," the little widow says,
graciously ; " we leave in an hour, I regret
to say, as I, should much like to have seen
Mr. Gilford, so kind and nice as I have always
found him ; but the train, like the tide, waits
for no man, you know, and the hour is fixed
for us to join our friends the St. Justss, at the
station ; delightful people. Lord and Lady
St. Just ; I wish your brother knew more
of them. We have arranged a little tour
together. My Ethel is enthusiastic about
scenery. If we had been staying here, I
should have begged you to be kind enough
to come to the cottage and look at some of
her sketches ! as it is, unfortunately, all I can
say is, good-bye, dear Miss Gilford, and I
trust we may meet again."

Bewildered and annoyed as she is, still
Mabel has no definite ground of offence
against Mrs. Heatherley, and cannot, therefore,
refuse to take the graciously proffered
little hand which that lady extends.

But it seemed to sting me, Walter," she
says, by-and-bye, when she is reporting the
interview to her astonished and acforrieved
brother, who has not seen Ethel for a week !

Ethel, gone ! without a word to me ! Impossible
! " he says, sternly. Bit when he
goes up to the cottage to have the "mistake,"
as he believes it to be, triumphantly rectified,
he finds the place deserted and its occupants
flown.

The servants are " left in charge, on board-wages,
for six weeks at least," they tell him ;
but they cannot give him any address, as
missus said ' there Alas no need to forward
letters; everything would keep till she came
home."

He has a sharp tussle with his pride fora
few minutes, and then he asks :

'Is there no note, no message for me,
from Miss Heatherley ? "

"Not a line, nor a word, sir," they tell
him, cheerfully ; and his heart is atiame with
wrath and fear. Instinctively he feels that
Mrs. Heatherley is going to try the well-known
power absence has of making the
heart grow fonder of  somebody else ; and
his jealous fancy vainly strives to paint the
lucky man who will be fiendishly invited to
join the party by that atrocious old matchmaker.
Lady St. Just.

And, unless Ethel writes to me, I can't
send her a line, praying her to be staunch,"
he tells himself, miserably ; " her mother has-planned
it Avell ! I can't combat that false
little fairy, who looks as innocent as a harebell.
She has planned it well! And she will
teach Ethel to think me careless and in-indifferent."


There is no professional call on his time
this evening, and in his desolate, miserable
dulness he is more than half inclined to goto
the Uplands, where two women are waiting
to welcome him with warm gladness, in
sharp contrast to the two who have gone away
from him with callous indifference. But he

subdues the half intimation, telling himself
that he will be a true knight to Ethel, however
sorely she may try him.

It is disappointing after this to find his
sister and Miss Somerset waiting for him
under the verandah, outside his drawing-room
window.

CHAPTEE VI.

A FATHER S Prayer AND PLAN.

Ethel Feathered must be freed

K;$

Nliis from the odium of being suspected
of being either heartless or sly with
as little delay as possible. The temptation of
being taken into the heart of beautiful
scenery has been put before her suddenly
and adroitly by old Lady St. Just, who likes
interfering with a love-affair for love of interference
; and who, additionally, really thinks
that pretty Ethel Heatherley ought to marry
someone better than a country surgeon."
Having once committed herself to the public
statement of this opinion, she is determined to
leave no stone unturned in the path by which
she proposes to lead Ethel out of the local
difficulty; and, without consulting Ethel's feelings
or wishes in the least, proceeds to pull
various strings, by means of which she intends
to set various influential puppets in motion.

VOL. I. H

Keep her from corresponding with the
young man while she is away, and leave the
rest to me," her ladyship says to Mrs.
Heatherley, " and be ready to start within
an hour after Ethel hears that we are
going."

All letters shall wait our return, and
I'm always in light marching order," Mrs,
Heatherley says, blithely. " My only difficulty
will be in case she insists on seeing
him before she goes."

Don't let her know she's going till he has
started on his long morning round. The rest
will be easy. Ethel is not an infatuated
goose. She won't be impolite enough to
want to make us lose our train, in order that
she may take a sentimental leave of her
lover," Lady St. Just says, gruffly. And on
these lines Mrs. Heatherley works.

Ethel is apprised of the contemplated
pleasure-trip, made to engross herself with
"Dackincf, told of Miss Gifford's arrival with a

J. o '

lovely friend, who has already shocked the
worthy mistress of the Uplands by her eagerness
to see Mr. Gifford," and, in short.

admirably " managed " through the hour
that elapses between her hearing that she
is to go, and her going.

When, in a flush of pleased excitement at
the prospect of the change, mixed with a
blush at the sound of the alarming charms
of Miss Somerset, Ethel comes down ready
dressed for the journey. Lady St. Just is
Avaitinoj for them in her carriage at the
door.

Mother," Ethel Whispers, " you said
you'd go and tell Walter, and fetch him up.
Have you been? Why isn't he here?"

His sister was there, dear child, and 1
could not get a clear answer from her as to
where her brother was," Mrs. Heatherley says,
with affected hesitation. " Don't mind it,
dear ; if he's worth anything, he will not bedazzled
away from you, though they say this
Miss Somerset is very dazzling. I almost wish
I had not sent up to the farm for eggs this
morning ; then I should not have heard of
her beauty, and her anxiety to see ' Walter,'
as she calls him. The servant told Sarah
that the young lady wouldn't eat any breathe



fast till Miss Gifford went to fetch her
brother ; so, I suppose, he had gone to the
Uplands when I went to his house with your
message. Naturally, I did not leave it with
his sister."

Mrs. Heatherley speaks almost sadly, her
sympathy with her child is so strong. But
her heart bounds with delight when Ethel
replies :

Come, mother, dear ; Lady St. Just is
waiting for us. Walter will write to me, if
he cares still. Of course, he'll get our
address from the servants."

This is not said in the form of a question ;
consequently Mrs. Heatherley does not feel
called upon to answer it. In a few minutes
her heart bounds more exultantly still ! They
are clear out of Atherton Towers without
having met with any obstruction from Walter
Gifford. It will be six weeks before he will
have a chance of making a personal appeal
to Ethel ! Time is so kind in the way of
obliterating one set of impressions, and
substituting others. Ethel is so pretty, and
fascinating, and sensible ; and dear Lady

St. Just is so practical and successful as a
social diplomatist ! No wonder that Mrs.
Heatherley feels satisfied that these ensuing
six weeks will contain all the possibilities
on which she relies to save her.

"It has all been so sudden that I don't
even know where we are going, first," Ethel
says, as the train bears them free of Atherton
Towers.

"Be satisfied to know that Lady St. Just
has' arranged a series of most delightful
surprises for 3'ou, Ethel. You could never
have arranged anything half so charming
for yourself," her mother says, rapturously :
and Ethel strives to express gratitude, and
to repress curiosity. But the latter is very
strong within her, and will put forth its head
again presently.

"Shall we be travelling all the time. Lady
St. Just?"

We shall travel till we settle for a time,"
her ladyship says, and again Ethel combats
curiosity successfully for a few minutes.

"Shall wee settle for more than a week?"

Lady St. Just nods assent.

For a fortnight ; or a month perhaps P "

About a month ; that will bring us to
the end of September, and the best of the
shooting will be over then."

Oh ! Are we going to stay at a shooting
box ? "

"Yes."

"At one of Lord St. Just's?"

"At one he rents."

"Where is it? "

"In Gloucestershire."

Lady St. Just, do tell me a little more
about it ; I've never been at a shooting
box ; is this one large or small, beautiful
or bleak, and what is it called ? "

It's a bijou shooting box, and it's called
Boyne Gate," Lady St. Just says, fixing her
eyes full on Ethel. " If you want to know
more about it, my dear, you must get your
information from the Marquis of Monkstown,
of whom we rent it, when he and his son,
Lord Kenmare, come to stay with us in a
fortnight."

Ethel feels her face tingling as this abrupt
mention is made of Marcus Boyne's father

and brother ; but she struggles to speak
unconcernedly :

I thought Lord Kenmare was very ill ? "
The one you are thinking of died the
day before yesterday ; Marcus is Kenmare
now. And now, my dear, take your book
or keep quiet ; I like to read when I'm
travelling, and hate to be bothered with
questions."

Ethel is only too glad to avail herself
of the opportunity of hiding her confusion
under cover of being engrossed with a
book. Has Fate played her this trick, and
are her mother and Lady St. Just guiltless
in the matter of bringing her into collision
with that delightfully dangerous rock on
which her fidelity to Walter Gifford was
so nearly wrecked the other day? If Fate
alone is to blame, then will Ethel go
through the ordeal of another meeting
with Marcus without repining and without
reproach. But if her mother and Lady
St. Just are leagued against her and Walter,
then Ethel weill retire from the unequal
battle, lest she loses it.

Oh, Walter ! pray that I may be true if
I am tried," the girl says to herself, " for I
love you and honour you ; but the other loves
me so well, and tells me, too, so. warmly."

Meanwhile " the other "  his sorrowful
duty of soothing the last sad, nearly unconscious
hours of his afflicted brother over
is trying hard to reconcile the conflicting
influences of his father and his union love.

The young man's task is a hard one. He
is Lord Kenmare now, the heir and hope of
his house, and his father can but partially
conceal the satisfaction he feels in having
such an heir. The Marquis of Monkstown
has suffered keenly both in his affections and
his pride during the whole term of life
allotted to the poor boy who is now gone.
He has loved him, Kenmare, as a son, but he
has shrank with bitter sickening pain of mind
and heart from the thought of Kenmare as
his successor. And in a dim way the poor
young fellow, who has not been so altogether
witless as some have believed, has felt and
mourned over his own indolent inability to
satisfy. When this grief and mourning and

self-distrust has been overwhelming him at
times, he would have died under it, battered
down by the hard heavy cruelty of it, had
it not been for his brother Marcus. But
Marcus is too like the mother the-y loved and
have lost, to have anything but deep generous
love in his heart for his brother. So it is in
Marcus's arms that Kenmare has died, and to
Marcus's lot it falls now to bear the brunt
of the first burst of mino-led orgies and relief
which emanates from Lord Monkstown,
carrying with it a confidence which is
almost a command.

"While my poor boy lived I said nothing
to you about your cousin Caroline ; your
uncle would never have let her look at
you," lord Monkstown says to the son who
is Lord Kenmare now, and who will be
Marquis of Monkstown, the day after the
death which Marcus is deploring with boyish
honesty and fervour ; " but it's different
now, and it's my duty as a father to tell
you what good fortune may be yours for
the asking."

I think there's only one human being

on the face of the earth for whom I care
rather less than I do for my cousin Caroline,
and that is for my uncle Hawtrey," Kenmare
says, languidly. His thoughts are with his
dead brother and his living love, Ethel
Heatherley, " who will be sorry for his
loss when she hears of it." He does not
like having these thoughts rudely disturbed
by suggestions about relations whom he
rather dislikes than otherwise.

Caroline Hawtrey has fifty thousand a
year of her own," Lord Monkstown says.

Ah ! so I've heard ; she has reason to
bless Cotton. I suppose she'll buy a title
with it ; something bigger than her mother
succeeded in getting. Sir John Hawtrey
was quite a little one, but he's a more
decent article to hand about as a father,
than old Wollaston, of Manchester, is reputed
to have been."

Sir John Hawtrey is your mother's brother,
Kenmare," the Marquis says, rebukingly,
but his eyes kindle with sympathetic fire
when his son flashes out 

A brother who gave my mother many a

heart-ache, many a rude rebuff and harsh
word when she was Lady Kenmare, and some
of his bloated wealth might have made life
smoother than it was then for you and her.
My brother, perhaps, would not have been
afflicted as he was if his mother's brother
had been more of a man and less of a mean
brute before your eldest son was born, sir."

Forget old injuries, Kenmare ; Sir John
and I have been friendly now for many a
long year ; we buried the hatchet "

When you came to the title and a good
property ; yes, I know that, father ; but my
brother's case was beyond medical skill by
that time, I've heard my mother say, and when
Sir John Hawtrey sheds crocodile tears over
Kenmare's grave, I shall remember and perhaps
remind him that the nephew he professes
to lament might have been alive and well
now, if he had spared a few guineas from his
thousands some years ago to a sister's prayers
and tears."

Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
them that trespass against us ; " quotes Lord
Monkstown, gravely and earnestly, laying his

hand on his son's shoulder. " Besides," he
adds, " in any case she is guiltless of all
offence against us. She must not be held
accountable or to blame for her father's
indifference and neglect. You are in a position
to ask for the hand of any woman in
England ; your uncle will admit that, though
his daughter is a magnificent match from the
money point of view, you will bestow a grand
equivalent on her ; and as you are free to
make it, I pray you to do so, my boy, for
Irish land no longer keeps up Irish titles."

I'm not free to make it," Kenmare says,
quietly. He has grown considerably older
during these sad days which he has spent by
the bedside of his dying brother. Manhood
and boyhood are separated by so fine and
delicate a line that a sharp touch of sorrow,
a keen feeling of responsibility, are, as a rule,
quite sufficient to break it.

Not free ! " Lord Monkstown has bushy
eyebrows and penetrating deep blue eyes.
His glance stabs like steel as he utters these
words  " Not free ! "

Well, not free in a sense," Kenmare says,

moving uneasily under the stabbing glance,
not from any feeling of shame for his love,
but because of the disquieting doubt he has
of having won anything like reciprocal feeling
from her,

In what sense, may I ask, are you  who
are responsible now for the honour of the
house and the welfare of the house  bound? "
the Marquis asks, with his grandest, because
it is his most subdued and intensely quiet
manner.

"I am neither bound nor free," Kenmare
says, trying to laugh away his own confusion.
"The truth is, sir, I have seen a girl who
seems to me to be the only girl I can ever
care to marry, but I am afraid she will never
care to marry me."

May I ask whether or not you have
confided these romantic sentiments to the
young lady ? "

I have let her know that I like her  that
I like her better than any one else in the
world," Kenmare says, flushing hotly.

And she, I presume, has been prudent
enough to say nothing definite?"

"Why should you presume that, sir?"
Kenmare asked, angrily.

"' Because I assume that you declared
yourself  while you were my second son 
with no income worth mentioning; it is
to the credit of the girls of this generation
that they are prudent enough to be indefinite
with younger sons."

She is not a girl of the class you are
thinking of, sir ! "

Good Heavens, Kenmare, I am thinking
of gentlewomen of our own class ! Is your
enslaver beyond that pale?"

She is the sweetest gentlewoman that ever
breathed," Kenmare cries, hotly ; " but she
is not a fashionable girl who regulates her
smiles to the fellows about her according to
their incomes ; the same day I told her dear
old Ken. was dying, I told her that I loved
her and would go back to her ; and she
stood out against me, and tried her best to
make me feel that nothing should ever tempt
her to "

He pauses abruptly; after all, he is not
justified in speaking of Ethel's engagement to

Mr. Gifford, to his father, who will regard it
as another insurmountable barrier to the accomplishment
of his own (Kenmare's) wishes.

Yes ! that nothing shall ever tempt her
to do  do what ? " Lord Monkstown asks,
icily.

To  to have anything to do with me,"
Kenmare stammers out, composedly, and Lord
Monkstown smiles in a weary, pitying way,
that shows he suspects his son is not stating
the case fully.

I will not ask you to tell me this young
lady's name ; it is probably one I have never
heard, nor will I ask where you met her ;
Townley ought to have known better than to
bring you in contact with designing rustic
beauty ; however, as things are, all is welland
I am happy to find that I can honourably
repeat what I said of you just now 
you are free to make the best match that
may be made in the kingdom ; I need not
add, my boy, that it is the fervent prayer of
my poor, over-tried heart, that you make it."

"Does Miss Hawtrey know of your
wishes ? " Kenmare asked, gloomily.

What are you thinking about ? " Is it
likely that we would risk wounding her
amour jropre until we were sure of your
prompt and eager acquiescence in the scheme
for your own happiness. Caroline will
accompany her father, and when they leave
we shall go back with them ; Boyne Gate is
close to Hawtrey's place, and I have accepted
an invitation from St. Just to stay there for a
month ; by the way. Lady St. Just hopes that
you will go to her for a few days."

Hate staying at Boyne Gate," Kenmare
grumbles, little guessing who will be thereto
make Boyne Gate an Elysium on earth to
him.

When you're tired of it you can go to
your Uncle Hawtrey's, and in her own home
you will have the best opportunity of studying
the best way of winning ray dear little
niece," Lord Monkstown says, conclusively ;
and for the time Kenmare feels that it will
be wise on his part to say no more of
Ethel.

The poor young fellow feels the iron entering
into him whichever way he turns. On

the one side is Ethel, who, though she has
not disdained, has unquestionably not encouraged
his suit, and on the other side is
his father unconditionally scorning him for
pursuing it  or rather, for wanting to pursue
it, and despising Ethel without knowing
her.

Jove ! she'd match him for pride, and
beat him hollow for savoir faire'' Kenmare
tells himself. At the same time he admits
to himself that his father will have a fair
amount of right and justice on his side
even if he does oppose an alliance with the
Fatherless with all his might.

The girl is perfect, as perfect as my wife
ought to be," the young fellow says, proudly
to himself, " but I wouldn't like to meet the
mother in the dark if I had offended lier ;
she'd as soon throttle that young doctor now
as look at him  for the sake of clearing m}
path ; and if an eligible duke cast a gracious
glance at Ethel !  the woman I want to make
my mother-in-law would gladly poison me !
All the same, I'll risk the surgeon's life and
my own for Ethel's sake."

VOL. I. I

FANNY YEARNS FOR ?

npHE travelling has been very pleasant,
pleasant as only wealth and experience
can make travelling, and, while
it has lasted, Ethel has scarcely been conscious
of missing anything ; for the girl is still
young enough and fresh enough to find
happiness in mere change of scene ; and,
moreover, she has been the pet of the party.
All things have been made to mould themselves
to her wishes, and the feeling of
consequence this course of treatment has
engendered has been very delightful to her.
Two or three people who were not in the
original programme have joined the party at
various places. The Bishop and his daughter
ran against them as they sauntered through
a Surrey village one evening, in a way that
would have surprised Lady St. Just and Ethel
much less than it did if they had only known

that Mrs. Heatherley had written to the
Bishop three days before, hinting that a
rencontre with him in this very place would
be one of the happiest incidents of the tour.
This bait would, she well knew, be quite
sufficient to catch his lordship, were it not
for his daughter. That young lady being
capable of interfering successfully for the
salvation of her parent, if free herself, it was
necessary to hang a tempting bait out for
her also, therefore, Mrs. Heatherley threw
a September fly for her, and landed her
cleverly.

I am sure Miss Templeton and you will
both be glad to hear that poor Lord Kenmare
has sufficiently recovered from the crushing
effects of the grief he felt at his brother's
death to promise to join us at Weybridge,
and, after a few days spent there in sketching,
boating, and fishing, to go on with us to
Boyne Place," the pretty little widow wrote,
laughing to herself the while, and telling
herself that "dear Fanny will leap at this
bait, and will bring dear papa to my feet
without delay, rather than lose the oppor-

I 2

unity of displaying her pretty innocence
and disinterestedness to Kenmare in the midst
of river scenery ! Let her come ! He will
never even see her when my Ethel is by."

So they are at Weybridge now, spending
the late August days very happily, according
to their respective lights. Lady St. Just, who
really loves Ethel Heatherley for her frankness
and good looks, loves sketching also, and is
well satisfied to sit for hours in one of the
exquisite glades on St. George's Hill, while
the young folks roam about, and lose themselves
in the wood, or to float idly in a boat
on the broad bosom of the Thames, while
Kenmare teaches Ethel how to hold her
line, and takes the little roach and barbel
off her hook, with a lingering tenderness
that is a maddening thing for Miss Templeton
to witness.

For Fanny does not do herself the injustice
of absenting herself from any of these
lounges through the wood and on the river,
and, to her surprise, Ethel never seems to
wish to rid them of her (Fanny's) companionship.
The Bishop's daughter is fairly

puzzled by this toleration, and is vexedly
uncertain whether it is attributable to indifference
to Kenmare or contempt for her own
charms. But whatever it may be, she takes
advantage of it to the utmost, and gives them
all to understand that " dear Ethel can't bear
to be a moment without her," And as Ethel
does not take the trouble to contradict this
statement, or in any way to tone it down, Ken-mare
is compelled to take a part constantly
in a trio while he is pining for a duet.

To tell the truth, Ethel is almost glad of
the girlish vigilance which protects her from
an outspoken avowal from Kenmare. For she
is tempest-tossed in her own soul now by
reason of the doubt of him, which Walter
Gifford's continued silence is causing her to
feel. And, worse than the silence, is the
rumour which every now and again floats
past her unwilling ear, relative to the beauty,
and bewitching charms and caprices, and the
lavish liberality to the poor, of Miss Somerset,
the doctor's sister's friend."

There is much of the happiness of " stolen
joy " in this period to Kenmare. He has

joined them at Lady St. Just's bidding, and
his father is well pleased that it should be
so, for every day the Marquis hopes to hear
they are at Boyne Gate, in Caroline's atmosphere.
An additional source of peace and
satisfaction to Lord Monkstown may be
found in the fact of his utter ignorance
and suspicion of Miss Heatherley being the
girl for whom iiis only son's heart is sick.

His son ]pas not kept him in the dark as
to the names of the other guests of Lady
St. Just. With a half-sense of its being
better to be. ingenuous than secret, Lord
Kenmare has written : " There are three or
four people here who seem to mean staying
on at Boyne Gate. The Bishop of Atherton
Towers, an old chap who would always be
Vicar of Bray, and who promotes men of
power and promise in his diocese without
regard to their views, provided they can
serve him when promoted ; and his daughter,
a girlish young creature, who means, I
fancy, to be Lady Kenmare ; Grove, the
Bishop's chaplain, a right good fellow, and
Mrs. Heatherley and her daughter. Mrs. H.

means the Bishop, as decidedly as the Bishop's
daughter means me, and if the latter goes
on neglecting her home policy on the
chance of widening her borders and annexing
me, she will find herself liberally endowed
with a step-mother before she has time for
protest or resistance."

" The governor can never say that I have
kept Ethel's being here dark," Kenmare tells
himself boldly, as he finishes writing this
letter, which carries the happy conviction
to his father's mind that " the boy is safe
enough with the St. Just set."

But though Kenmare tells himself that he
is putting himself beyond the reach of reproach
by writing thus, his conscience tells
him that he is acting disingenuously to say
the least of it, if not deceitfully, in throwing
his father off the right track by his mention
of the Bishop's daughter, and mere cursory
allusion to Miss Heatherley. It is in vain he
tells himself that he has written nothing: but
the truth. He knows that he has suppressed
the only part of it which holds vital interest
for his father.

The hotel at which they have temporarily
established themselves in Weybridge is down
close by the ferry. You have only to saunter
a few yards along the road, turn a corner
round a hedge, and you find yourself on a
slope of grass, with the broad shining river
running along at your feet.

The silence and the beauty of the scene are
very conducive to sentiment, especially by
moonlight ; and by moonlight Lord Ken-mare
strives to teach the full beauty of it,
and of all the possibilities it suggests, to
Ethel.

They are come to the very last August
days now, and the harvest moon is nearly
full. Dinner is over, and the elders of the
party have settled themselves to the work
that so speedily brings its OAvn sweet reward,
of peeling peaches and pouring out the wines
that best assimilate with the subtle flavour of
the fruit. The young people have strolled
out, nominally to look at the effect of the
moon over the extreme tip of the highest
chimney-pot. When they have admired this
exhaustively, a suggestion floats in the air

as to their going down to the river, and
Ethel and Miss Templeton act on it at
once.

We ought to follow the ladies and see
that they come to no harm," Lord Kenmare
says to Mr. Grove, and the latter immediately
assenting (though at the same time he practically
remarks that " the ladies are safe
enough), the quartette presently stand on
the bank looking out at the ferry.

suddenly the boat glides close up to them,
and without giving a thought to the consequences,
Ethel slips her hand out from
Miss Templeton's restraining arm, and reaching
a ste]) forward, cries :

Let us cross over to the other side,
do? Who will come with me?"

"You must not think of it, Ethel," Fanny
says, assuming the duenna demeanour far too
naturally to be in keeping with the youthful
rule she desires to play. " Papa won't like it,
and Em sure Lady St. Just "

"Mother won't mind my going, I know
that," Ethel laughs. "You had better all
three of you go back and proclaim that

you have no part With disobedient me. I
mean to go over."

And I mean to come with you," Kenmare
cries, jumping into the boat, and drawing
Ethel after him, and in an instant the ferryman
pushes off. Perhaps he feels that the
young pair in the boat are not dependent
for their current happiness upon the other
pair on the bank.

Miss Templeton's delicate pink cheeks grew
rosier even in the cold moonlight.

Did you ever see such an audacious girl
as Ethel Heatherley?" she exclaims; "dragging
Lord Kenmare away alone with her in
this way ; her conduct would be bold and
disgusting even if she were not engaged, as
it is it's disgraceful beyond everything."

It was not Miss Heatherley's doings that
the boat pushed off without us," Mr. Grove
laughs ; " she wanted us all to go, if you
remember ; it is Lord Kenmare who has
seized the opportunity."

"The opportunity! for what?"

For being alone with the girl he loves."

Nonsense ! she compels him to pay

her attention by flirting at him abominably,
but I am sure he's not serious," Fanny says,
sharply ; " I could tell by the way he looked
at me as he 2:ot in that he wanted me to 2:0
too ; but I am not in the habit of doing such
things," she winds up, lamely.

I think you're mistaken about his having
wished you to go with them," Grove says,
simply ; and then, without having the
slightest desire to mortify her, but just because
it is the case and he knows it, he adds :

I saw him slip a coin into the ferry-man's
hand, and heard him whisper ' Shove off.'
I wish him success with Miss Heath erle, withall
my heart ; she'll make a splendid little
marchioness and an equally good wife."

Miss Templeton shivers as she hears her
own fears and suspicions confirmed in this
way, and a gnawing desire to put herself
beyond Lord Kenmare's reach should he even
yet repent him of his evil ways and want to
reach her, takes possession of her. She has
resolved that she will not return to Atherton
Towers a free and fatherless thing. As the
Bishop's daughter she knows that she is

pretty nearly played out. But as the ambitious,
gracious, patronising, powerful wife of
a risuig mau, she may still play a distinguished
part m the secular element of clerical
life in the diocese.

And who so fitted to rise as the man
standing by her side? Her father's chaplain,
the one who steers the Bishop over
stormy seas with such safety and discretion.
There hangs about him, too, a halo of
romance, for he has loved her long and well,
she firmly believes, and nothing less than
the prospect of a coronet would have made
her waver from him. As it is, she congratulates
herself on the wavering having
all been done cautiously and decently, on
having been all done " inwardly," in fact,
and so being invisible to the naked eye.

In the course of the few minutes that
elapse between the ferry-boat leaving the
Weybridge bank and gaining the Clipperton
side, Miss Templeton, though she watches
it with all she has of heart in her eyes, has
come to the conclusion that " Mr. Grove
deserves to be rewarded by her for his touching

devotion and fidelity, and that lie will
reward him." It will be doubly his duty
after this to preserve papa from all those
perils to which bishops, who must talk (and
can't talk) in convocation and elsewhere, are
liable. And it will be doubly pleasant for
her to lay this honourable onus upon him
now on this evening, when Lord Kenmare
may be conceited enough to suppose that
she is suffering: from his desertion.

It does not occur to her for a moment
that, having herself loosened Mr, Grove's
shackles, he may be unwilling and unready
to tighten them again. He has been so consistently
kind, courteous, cheerful, affable,
and Avell satisfied during these last few weeks
in which she has been considerately letting
him down from the giddy eminence of her
flattering regard, that she feels safe in the
conviction that he has not observed the
change. And though it is mortifying to feel
that he has been so unobservant of aught
that concerns her, still the law of compensation
works, and she admits that in this case
it is better so.

It is difficult to begin again with him after
being out of practice so long ; but mere
difficulty is not sufficient to deter Fanny.
As soon as she can command her voice,
and feel sure of speaking in soft, kindly
tones, she replies to his remarks about
Ethel making a splendid marchioness and
an equally good wife by saying:

If you really think there is a probability
of such a happy ending to this thoughtless
freak of theirs, they will be just as well
pleased to find us gone when they come
back as waiting for them."

Unquestionably they will ; are you feeling
cold? Shall we go in? " he asks, with
amiable, ready, obtuse acquiescence.

Not in the least cold, and not at all
inclined to go in," she says, lowering her
voice so that he has to bend his head towards
her in order to catch the meaning of
her words. Then she turns and abstractedly
paces along very slowly in the opposite direction
to the homeward one, and, as in duty
bound, he courteously paces along by her
side.

The moon is making a silver pathway up
the river, and the silence around them is
unbroken. Now or never is the time for her
to indicate to him that she considers their
relations to one another are unaltered.

This is very sweet," she begins, looking
up at him, and her face, rising out of the
soft masses of a white Shetland shawl, is
very young and innocent in the moonlight.

Very jolly, indeed," he says, heartily.
And she replies, " Yet I'm sure we both long
to get back to the dear old Palace gardens,
where we've spent so many, many happy
hours together ; this travelling about is very
nice, but we always seem to be with other
people, and I am getting tired of it ; do let
us persuade papa to give up Boyne Gate
and go home, when the others leave Wey-
bridge."

I thought you were enjoying it, and
looking forward to the time at Boyne Gate
as much as any of us ? " he says, in some
surprise ; and then he is conscious that
Fanny is appealing to him with all the
mute power of appeal there is in woman.

Her eyes are raised with timid tenderness to
his, her hand sUps into his arm in order that
she may steady herself in crossing a rugged
bit of turf, and the Avoids she murmurs
tremble on her lips.

Happy ! Yes, I am ' happy,' because
after all, little as we have been seeing of
each other in the old way lately, still we
have been together. But / am very faithful
to my love of the old order of things at the
Palace ; yow never read to me here as you
used to do in the garden at home ; these
people come between us and make us seem
to drift apart ; and  well ! altogether, I shall
be happier when we are home again."

He cannot help understanding that she is
ready to love once again ; but he knows that
not only is he not ready, but that he never
will be able to make himself ready any more.
The coldness that he knows has not been
caprice nor uncertainty, but nothing better
than cool calculation on her part, has chilled
and nipped his budding regard for her.
Nothing will ever make it spring forth and
bloom again. But he is a gentleman and he

likes her, and is sorry both for the mistake
she has made in leaving him, and for the
mistake she is now making in coming back
to him.

"You're very fond of the old Palace, are
you not ? " he says, kindly ; and then he goes
on, " I don't wonder at it either, for I'm
sure if it had been my home as long as it
has been yours, I should be fond of it too."

"Are you not fond of it as it is?" she
asks, with tender reproach, and he thinks
it better for them both that he should be
very matter-of-fact about it.

"I think the Palace a very jolly place to
tent in for a time, but, to tell the truth, I
fear a cathedral-town sphere of work is nota
congenial one to me ; it's stasfnatinoj ; the
chaplaincy is too much of a sinecure for a
strong young fellow like me; I ought to be
in the heat of the battle, and some poor
fellow, who has nearly worn himself out in
his work, ought to have my easy berth."

Do you mean-you can't mean that you
think of leaving?" she gasps.

Indeed I do, Miss Templeton ; I can stand

VOL. I. K

contact with the rough edges of life, and
many of my brethren are physically unable
to do that, who yet would fill my present
comfortable niche quite as well as I do."

It will break papa's heart if you leave,"
she says, vehemently ; and then with a sob,
she adds in a whisper, " and mine, too."

I'm sure the Bishop will feel I'm right'"
Mr. Grove says, discreetly ignoring the whisper.
" Look ! they're crossing over again.
Shall we go bask and meet them ? "

Fanny's clasp on his arm grows tighter.
Shall she, the Bishop's daughter, meekly submit
to being conquered and discomfited by
her father's chaplain. It is not love, but a
wild craving desire to carry her point which
prompts her now.

Stop ! " she says, passionately ; " forgive
me. I know you have fancied me cold, or
not observant of your affection for me, but
your threat to go has shown me the state of
my own heart. I cannot let you go without
telling you that you have entirely won me
now  for I cannot part with 3'ou."

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.

k'EEHAPS the Bishop's daughter would
' not pursue her own course with such
remorseless zeal were she endowed
with the useful gift of prescience, which
would enable her to see the way in Which
her father is improving the shining hour of
her absence.

All the romance of the party has not gone
out into the moonlight by the river with the
young people ; in fact, Mrs. Heatherley, whose
grace and tact, and happy art of making the
best and most of any situation in which she
may find herself, has passed into a proverb
in her circle, has given the Bishop a glimpse
of a blissful domestic picture ! And the
Bishop has regarded it with affectionately
approving eyes.

Practically the mature pair are as much
alone as either of the young couples down by

K 2

the river. For Lady St. Just sleeps well after
a generous dinner, taken at the close of a
long open-air day ; and under cover of her
reassuringly deep and slumberous breathing,
Mrs. Heath erle shows the Bishop how easy a
thing it is to cross the delicate neutral line
between friendship and love.

We may not either of us look forward to
keeping our dear girls with us much longer,"
she murmurs, as, from the window which is
farthest from Lady St. Just, the Bishop and
herself watch the four young people turn the
corner to the river.

And we must prepare to part with them
cheerfully, if it is for their happiness that
they should go," the Bishop says, heartily.
To do him justice he has been quite ready to
part with his Fanny any day during the last
ten years. At some periods, when her yoke is
heavy, it occurs to him to feel that the time is
long in getting ripe for her flight from the
paternal roof.

Ah ! yes ! our love for them will make
us seem cheerfully resigned," the fair, bright
little widow says, with a mixture of sparkle

and pathos, that calls his attention to the
sweet blue of her eyes, and the exquisite
tenderness of her heart at the same moment ;
but we shall both be very dull and desolate
in our respective homes. When Fanny goes,
and I'm sure it will not be Mr. Grove's fault
if she does not go soon, yours will be a very
solitary life, though you will live it in a
Palace, my friend ! "

"Do you think that Grove thinks of this
still ? At one time I fancied that affection
was springing up between them, but lately I
have thought there was a certain stiffness and

o

want of cordiality towards him on Fanny's
part."

Mrs Heatherley's eyes sparkle more than
ever, as she reflects, that the real cause of
the change in Fanny has been the latter's
presumptuous desire to dispute the " big-game"
 Lord Kenmare  with Ethel. But
she merely says 

Trust me for reading these riddles aright.
I am almost as sure that your daughter
will be Mrs. Grove as I am that mine will
be Lady Kenmare."

The Bishop pricks up his ears. Good man
as he is, he is alive to the value of a good
worldly connection, and if Mrs. Heatherley is
to be the mother of Lady Kenmare, and by-and-bye,
of the Marchioness of Monkstown,
who so well fitted as the attractive little
widow to be the Bishop's wife, and the
enhvener of his solitude.

I shall give Fanny to Grove with great
satisfaction ; he will rise on his own merits,
for, quite independently of his having any
family claim upon me, I shall feel it my duty
to give him good preferment ; but as you say
I shall be a very solitary man when I lose my
daughter, and you ! "

He pauses, and his silence is so eloquent
that Mrs. Heatherley turns her face coyly
away as she relies 

I suppose rigid Mrs. Grundy will denounce
me if 1 venture to go to the Palace
to talk over these happy days that we are
spending together ! Days that unfortunately
are only too short, and too nearly at an end."

Mrs Grundy will never dare to asperse
you while I live, dear lady."

All! my dear lord, you forget that I am
not so very old a woman that you, an attractive
man, may dare to be kid to me without
calling forth comment and ' malignity : yet
though I shall be too cowardly ever to do it,
I will dare to paint a picture of cosy hours
spent with you in that grand library  of
sunny hours in your lovely grounds  of long
delightful readings. I take such a deep,
unceasing interest in politics, that when you
have the gout I muM come and read the debates
to you "

I will not have you contemplate that
contingency only," the Bishop says, feeling
almost young and debonair, as Mrs. feathered's
facile mental brush puts in the lights
and shades of these pleasantly-pictured possibilities.
But, though he says this, a vision
of himself prostrate and in pain, without the
presence of this most soothing woman, rises
before him and pleads for her !

She lias precisely the voice for reading
aloud clear, sweet, and not too rapid.
She is well off, too, and will not limit the
hospitalities of the Palace severely', as this

daughter has done at times. If he must
lose Fanny for Fanny's good-sho can
blame him for seeking the constant companionship
of a mind and heart-stirring
woman, in the most unexceptionable way ?
It is not good for bishops to live alone,
more than any other man ! She will be
essentially the right woman in the right
place  averse to frivolous gaiety, and admirably
contented with cosy hours with
him in the library, and political readings
by his couch of pain.

I will not have you contemplate the
contingency of my illness only ; with you
by my side, constantly, I should be happier
and, therefore, healthier probably, than I
have been since the death of my  I mean
since I have lived a sedentary and secluded
life. The responsibilities of the position I
venture to offer you are many," the Bishop
goes on, with unconscious pomposity. " Its
worldly gaieties are of necessity few ; but
your place will be a high one ; a fierce
light will shine upon you, and I feel sure
you will bear it bravely."

He pauses, his eloquence checked by an
untimely remembrance of his daughter, and
of the wrath that young lady will feel and
display when she hears of what he has been
about in her absence. But Mrs. Heatherley
fills the pause graciously.

"I won't affect to misunderstand you," she
says, with an amount of womanly self-possession
and frankness that is rather
embarrassing to him for a moment, for Lady
List. Just is giving signs of waking, and he
feels that this vital matter is to be clinched
in her presence.

1 won't affect to misunderstand you, my
lord, and I accept the honour you have done
me with the more readiness, because I feel
that I shall fill the position of your wife in a
way that will redound to yoivr credit, as it
shall redound to my own."

she strikes the key-note of the tune to
which she means to set our altered lives in
that speech," the Bishop says to himself, in a
little spasm of alarm at the boldness and
irretrievably of the step he has taken.
And he is right ; Mrs. Heatherley has taken

the reins into her own fair, firm little
hands, and will drive the episcopal chariot
where and how she pleases from this day
forth.

The matter is all settled, and he is receiving-lady
St, Just's congratulations before he has
quite decided in his own mind whether or not
he has asked this woman to be his wife !
Then, in a few minutes, his daughter and his
chaplain come in, and he is observing with
alarm that Fanny's brow is ominously
clouded, and her lips pressed alarmingly
together. Mrs. Heatherley burns his boats
behind him by saying, playfully 

Tell my new daughter that I am going
to try and fill the place she has adorned so
long, and to share her care of you.'''

To which Miss Templeton replies, unpropitiously,
" Papa will never waste his time
in trying to make me believe such an
utterly incredible thing, Mrs. Heatherley."
At which display of temper the pretty widow,
who has won the game, and who can,
therefore, afibrd to be affable and forgiving,
smiles her sunniest smile, and putting

her gentle powerful little paw on her 
Bishop, says :

"I hope, dear, that my child will accord
you a warmer welcome into her family
than your daughter accords me into yours.
If you can't give me a daughter's affection,
Fanny, I hope at least you will tive me a
sister's sympathy," she continues, so sweetly,
that Fanny feels it will be impolitic to exhibit
resentment at the allusion to her
having passed girlhood.

Papa's wife will not stand in need of
sympathy from me"' she says, brusquely,
and Mrs. Heatherley passes by the observation
with magnanimous unconcern, feeling
sure that she is not the only bitter
drop in Fanny's cup at present.

Allow me to offer you my heartiest
congratulations and warmest hopes for
your happiness," Mr. Grove says, with a
bold acceptance of the situation that enables
the Bishop to hold up his head.

Mrs. Heatherley rewards the speaker at
once.

And allow me to say that I hope you will

be very, very often at the Palace to witness
that happiness, Mr. Grove, when you can
spare the time from the prettiest rectory
and parish in the Bishop's gift "

Livings are in papas gift, not yours
yet'' Miss Templeton interrupts.

But he shall not stray about among the
vacant ones in solitude and uncertainty as to
whom he shall bestow them on any longer,"
Mrs. Heatherley says, caressingly. " I mean
to take the greatest interest in everything you
do and think of doing, dear," she continues,
and the Bishop smiles feebly, but withal
sullenly. To be called " dear," and openly
comforted, was not in the agreement he
made with himself about the terms he would
make with Mrs. Heatherley. However, he
keeps silence, for to protest or rebuke, and
fail to subdue, would be fatal, indeed, just
now.

I'm afraid I shall not be in the way of
benefiting by your patronage," Mr. Grove
says, blithely and frankly. He is not displeased
with Mrs. Heatherley for the tone
she has taken  he will be out of the diocese

soon ; this, for one thing, and, for another,
her rule is, or will be, a more graceful one
than Fanny's has been. Nevertheless, he is
sorry for Fanny, and, if it were possible, he
would go back to his old ground with her,
and remove her from the humiliations to
come.

But it is not possible ! He had never been
in love " with her, and now he was quite out
of the habit of her ; and this he had given
her to understand fully and clearly during
the last ten minutes which they spent alone
together in walking; up from the river.

But he had done this with courtesy and
consideration ; allowing her to suppose that
the change in him had been wrought by herself,
sparing her all the mortification that is
possible, by his manner of suggesting that he
has believed it to be her desire to alienate
him.

Thus, on the surface, her pride is spared,
though in her heart she knows well that his
regard for her could never have been as
strong as she thought it, since it has been
so easily killed.

Nevertheless, this tone, which he has
chivalrously taken, will make the task which
is before her -of accounting for its being allover
between them  a far easier one than it
would have been had Mr. Grove simply
backed out of the semi-entanglement without
this flattering explanation.

Fanny has a keen recollection of having
given all and sundry of her lady friends and
acquaintances to understand that it rests
with herself to convert the bachelor chaplain
into the Bishop's son-in-law, any day she
pleases. She has even gone so far, in
moments of elation, as to hint that his
pertinacity and jealousy have been the
winning powers that have moved her, and
to imply that he had to fight hard and
humbly for the victory which he has finally
attained over her virgin heart. She knows
well that these hints and suggestions will be
remembered against her when Mr. Grove
openly resigns her and the chaplaincy, and
goes off without any visible mark of having
suffered in the conflict, upon him. There will
be many to say that she has deluded herself

all along, and that the love-passages which
she has prettily confessed, have been purely
imaginary.

By-and-bye Ethel and Lord Kenmare come
in, and Mrs. Heatherley is disappointed at the
first glance. Kenmare looks dispirited, and
Ethel is flushed and distressed in appearance.
The girl's first words, too, prove that golden
as the opportunity by the moonlighted river
has been, the young people have not made the
most of it, as Nature and Providence seemed
to design, by getting engaged.

Mother, I want to go home tomorrow
instead of going to Boyne Gate ; no. Lady
St. Just, don't say that I'm tired of you, and
don't be angry with me ; I can't be happy
until I know why Walter GifFord seems to
have forgotten me."

You're not weak enough to waste a
thought about a man who even seems to
have forgotten you, I hope," her mother
says, coldly, and the flush deepens on Ethel's
brilliant face as she answers:

Yes, I am ; for I know it's only seeming."

Mr. Gifford must be unlike any other

fellow in the world if he could forget
Miss Heatherley," Lord Kenmare says, with a
gallant effort, "though I wish, with all my
heart, you could forget him," he adds, in a
low tone, to Ethel.

Perhaps I wish it, too," she murmurs, for
the pertinacious young lover who is present
does contrast favourably just now with the
apparently negligent one who is absent. And
on the strength of these words, uttered partly
in pique and partly in idleness. Lord Kenmare
determines to persist in his suit, and to finally
win both Ethel and his father to regard it
favourably.

I want to speak to you in my room tonight,
Ethel," Mrs. Heatherley says, rising up
and silently extending her hand to the Bishop,
who takes it and retains it honos enough to
give Ethel time to see that something has happened
between her mother and the Bishop.
Then the newly-betrothed pair separate, and
the Bishop says good-night to Ethel in a paternal
and benedictory way that informs her of
the truth, before her mother can word it
touchingly and gracefully.

"Mother," the girl begins, as soon as she
gets into her mother's room, " what is it ?
what does it mean ? The Bishop patted my
head as if I had been a little child, and
Fanny glared at me as if I had wanted him
to do it  what does it mean ? "

Before I tell you that, tell me chat you
mean by making a scene about Mr. Gifford,"
Mrs. Heatherley says, reproachfully.

Ethel's arms are round her mother's
neck in a moment. The girl wants to be
strengthened and supported in her intention
of being leal to her absent lover.
She is made of the stuff to hate herself if
she does eventually fall away from her freely
given promise to marry Walter Gifford by-and-bye.
Yet, all the while she feels that
Lord Kenmare, with his warmly-proffered
love, his great personal beauty, and his winning
way, is a great temptation to her.

Oh, mother ! say something kind of
Walter; help me to keep on loving him
best," she pleads, with her arms clinging
closely round her mother's neck.

"My dear Ethel, nonsense! Mr. Gifford

is showing plainly that he can resign you,
and it is your duty to me and to yourself
to regard your eno-acfement with him as at
an end. I am not going to say anything
to you about Lord Kenmare more than
this : that his preference for you demands
this return  that you do nothing hastily ;
it would grieve the Bishop  to say nothing
of myself  if you raise any objection to
going to Boyne Gate.

The Bishop has nothing to do with me,
and if I do what I think right I don't
care whether he's grieved or not."

"The Bishop's wishes are paramount with
me ; in running counter to his desire for
your welfare, you will be directly opposing
me  your mother ! "

Oh, Mother ! dont bring him in between
us," Ethel says, tempestuously. "What can
it be to him whether I go to Boyne Gate,
or, for the matter of that, whether I ever
speak to Lord Kenmare again?"

"The Bishop does me honour in proposing
to become my husband, and he does you
honour, Ethel, in proposing to treat you as

his own daughter"' Mrs. Heatherley says,
with the air of patient sweetness that she
has invariably found useful in the subjugation
of Ethel.

Mother, dear, let him do you all the
honour he can  he can't shoal you too much
homage for your goodness in giving your
darling, pretty self to his service ; but don't
let him try to ' father ' me ; if he wants
Lord Kenmare in the family for his own
honour and glory's sake, let him marry
Kenmare to Fanny."

You were never a silly child, Ethel,
always my brightest and best companion ;
don't be a silly girl ! " and with these words
Mrs. Heatherley dismisses her daughter with
a kiss, and proceeds to write an autumn
programme for herself.

Let me see ! " she says, meditatively
pausing, pen in hand, for a minute or two ;
a fortnight at Boyne Gate will bring us
to the middle of September ; by that time
Ethel will be settled  the child is too
sensible to continue contumacious, and
Kenmare is too fascinating to be resisted

AUert(?n Towers.

long. Then home for a month of preparation
! The weddings shall be the third
week in October, and before I sleep I'll
write to Worth about the dresses."

SISTERLY ZEAL.

(LL the place is talking about it, so

0m it must be true," Miss Gifford
says, angrily and conclusively, to her brother,
when he disputes her assertion that there is to
be a double wedding at the cottage soon,
dien Mrs. Heatherley will take the Bishop to
honour and obey her, and her daughter
will marry Lord Kenmare.

Lily and I have been in at Turner's,"
Miss Gifford continues, animatedly, " and
they showed us the order for the costumes,
eight for Mrs. Heatherley, and eight for
Miss Heatherley. The bridal dresses are
coming from Paris, Mrs. Turner says, but
there is no doubt about these eight a-piece
being trousseau dresses, and so, naturally,
there is no doubt about Miss Heatherley
going to marry Lord Kenmare."

"I will, not believe it jet," Mr. Gifford

says, stoutly ; but it vexes him to* see that
his sister and her friend exchange smiles
that seem fraught with pity for his contemptible
blindness.

I would not believe it  yet," Lily Somerset
says, quietly. " I would wait on in patient
endurance until the wedding-day, and all
doubt is over, if I were a man and in your
place. I would give the woman I loved all
the satisfaction and honour and glory I could.
I would not give her indifference for indifference,
scorn for scorn ; I would show her
that I was the real ' gentle tassel,' ready to
be whistled back again at any moment.
But when I had done all this, and been requited
by her according to my deserts, I
would never dare to ask another woman to
love me."

Walter Gifford strokes his moustache,
meditatively, as he listens to this harangue,
which Miss Somerset delivers with the most
absolute composure, in silvery, unruffled
accents.

I am never likely to ask another woman
to love me," he says, presently, and Lily

nods her head at him in an approving way
that provokes rather than soothes him.

Of course, you are not likely to do it ;
it wil be only due to Lady Kenmare to show
her that where she has ruthlessly wounded
no other can heal. And what an amusing
story Mrs. Templeton will make out of your
fidelity to her beautiful daughter ; you'll bethe
topic at the Bishop's dinners and the
Bishops's garden-parties for a time ; and I
shouldn't wonder if the fact of your wearing
the willow publicly increased your practice
considerably. I hope it will, I am sure, for
the law of compensation ought to work in
some way."

It is working already," he says, trying
to speak gaily ; " it is making you think
about me, and talk to me more than you
have for years."

They are sitting in the rafter-roofed, old-world
sitting-room at the Uplands ; it is easy
for Miss Gifford to slip out of the room at
this juncture without distracting their attention,
or in any way disturbing them. The
daylight is waning, and the moon has not

risen yet. From their seats in the wide
window-recess, the old-fashioned garden, in
which pear and apple trees are mixed up in
picturesque confusion with tall hollyhocks
and sun-flowers, and feathery plants of
waving asparagus that has gone luxuriantly
to seed, looks quaint and attractive. Just
under the window a mass of lemon-thyme
and mint surrounds a few sweet-scented
bushes of late-flowering; roses. Altogether
there is a softening, subduing influence in the
beauty and the perfume that permeates the
atmosphere. And Walter Gifford, wearied
as he is by a hard day's work, and many
conflicting emotions about his absent Ethel,
feels that it is pleasant to look upon so fair
a scene with such a sympathetic companion.

Pleasant but dangerous, as Lily droops
the face that is as fair as her name with
languid tenderness towards him, and murmurs
in reply 

Does it please you that I should show the
interest I have never ceased to feel in you by
saying bitter things of the girl who has won
your love only to throw it away like an old

glove ? Oh ! I am vexed with myself for
having been so weak as to give you such an
occasion for triumphing over me."

Heaven knows I have never felt triumphant
where you have been concerned," he
says, moodily ; " and even now I know that
you only portray interest in me as you gather
flowers  to please yourself for the moment."

Walter, you wrong me, indeed you do, in
thinking so of me now ; there was a time
when I did not appreciate you, a time when
in my egotism I told you so for granted that
1 did not think it possible to wear out your
regard by my caprices ; but you taught me a
sharp lesson, and I have learnt it well ; you
can't forgive, any more than I can forget."

I forgave you all the pain you made me
suffer long ago," he says, frankly; "but you
are right in hinting that I can't reconstruct
the old romance; you wouldn't be happy if I
attempted to do it ; you would feel naturally
that you deserved more than grateful friendship,
which is all that I can ever offer you."

If Ethel Heatherley had never existed

you would be more forgiving to me I "

You shall not speak of forgiveness ; you
broke the chain of feeling which once bound
us together, yourself; I haven't the power
of re-uniting the links, that is all. Perhaps if
Ethel Heatherley had never existed I should
have carried ray end of the chain up to this
present day ; as it is "

She will cease to exist for you when she
becomes Lady Kenmare ? "

She will  God bless her ! but she is not
Lady Kenmare yet, nor will she ever be," he
says, heartily, gathering fresh faith in Ethel
from the force of his own words.

Lily leans through the open window and
gathers a sprig of something at random. It
happens to be mint, and as she presses it and
smells it, and then hands it to him, she says,
prosaically, and as if the preceding conversation
had not been one of vital interest to
her, " We shall always think of each other
and of what we have been saying in future
Avhen we see roast lamb and mint sauce,
shan't we? shockingly commonplace, isn't
it ? but so true and we both like truth."

Then she rises from the window, and irons

back to a corner in the room where an old
piano stands, and, sitting down to it, she
begins to sini " In the Gloamino-."'

As her soul-fright voice gives power and-pathos
to the song, which in itself is mere
prettiness, Mr. Gifford, who has borne himself
bravely in the battle up to this point,
feels that he is vulnerable after all. Why,
if Ethel is false, should " what has been "
with Lily " never be again ? "

To love is best, but to be loved is good,"
he tells himself, and there is something of
this sentiment expressed in the way he holds
Lily Somerset's hand when he says goodnight
to her,

"Well!" Mabel, the over-anxious sister, asks
eagerly, as she comes back to the room after
accompanying her brother to the garden gate,
Well, how are you and Walter getting on ? "

We shall get on better when Miss
Heatherley is married'"

It's tame of Walter to wait till all the
world has seen that she has thrown him
over," Miss Gifford says, indignantly, and
forthwith she determines to do something

rather desperate, for the sake of what she
deems the honour, and dignity, and happiness
of her brother.

Miss Gifford does not hold the pen of
a ready writer, therefore her self-appointed
task is a laborious one, and occupies her
well-nigh through all the hours of the night.
Weariness and sleepiness is her portion in
the morning, but she gets up bravely and
waits upon Lily Somerset as assiduously as
ever, for she has upon her the pleasing consciousness
of having done a good work
for her brother.

This " good work " goes forth by the midday
post from Atherton Towers in the guise
of a letter to Miss Heatherley, whose address
the devoted sister has procured, at the
cost of a considerable amount of speciously
worded enquiry, from the head milliner at
Turner's shop, and Ethel receives it three or
four days after her arrival at Boyne Gate.

It is as follows : 
Dear Madam, 

I must begin by offering you a profound
apology for the liberty which 1, a

stranger, take in addressing you at all.
Xothini: but the earnest desire I have to seethe
welfare and happiness of my dear brother
secured could excuse this conduct, even in
my own eyes.

"A rumour has reached us that you are
about to make a brilliant marriage very
shortly, but my brother refuses to accept the
release from his engagement to you until he
hears from you that he may take his freedom
honourably. My reason for hoping that you
will act thus generously is, that I have good
reason to know that my brother would find
happiness with another, if it were not for his
scruples concerning you ; and I am sure,
from what I have heard of your nobility of
character, you would not wish to stand in
his way now that you have preferred another
to him.

My brother is not aware of my intention
of writing to you, nor do I wish him to
know it, as, unless he feels that your action
is spontaneous, and not the result of interference,
he may refuse to be influenced by it.

In conclusion, my dear young lady, let

me pray you again to pardon this bold act
of mine, and to believe that I am actuated
solely by my affection for my brother, and
my heartfelt belief that what I ask you todo
will enable him to become a happy and
wealthy man.

I am, dear Madam,

Respectfully yours,

"Mabel Gifford."

Happily for herself, Ethel is alone when
she receives this extraordinary epistle. Her
first indignant impulse upon reading it, is
to enclose it to Walter, without a word. Her
next is to write to him, asking, " if it can be
true that he is not only willing to let her go,
but ready to console himself with ' another,'
as his sister puts it ? " This is the reasonable
and right impulse ! Unfortunately, however,
Ethel does not act upon it, but reads the
letter over again and again, until her whole
soul is filled with anger and mortification, and
while this last and worst mood is upon her
she writes to Walter 

Do not let any further thought of me
weigh with you for a moment longer. I

have gone out of your life for ever ! and
I can only hope that you Avill seek happiness
where you can find it, and as soon as
possible forget that Ethel Heatherley ever
existed." '

"Mother," she says, an hour or two afterwards,
coming upon that lady and the Bishop
in one of the many sequestered walks that
intersect the Boyne Gate grounds, " I have
something to tell you."

The girl turns into a side path, and looks
as if she expected her mother to follow her.
But Mrs. Heatherley is indisposed to do anything
that may look like independent action
in the eyes of the Bishop.

"You may feel sure that the Bishop will
listen with glad interest to anything that concerns
you, dear," she says, with her freshest,
youngest air of innocent reliance on the
Bishop's affections ; but Ethel is in the
wrong mood to return her mother's fascinating
lead.

"If you won't come and hear my news,
mother, I will keep it for a more convenient
season," the disappointed daughter says, with

a catch in her voice that appeals to so much
as is motherly in the vain little widow's heart.

Spare me for a few moments, will you ? "
she says, coquettishly ; " my child is a little
tiny bit jealous of the time I give to you, I'm
afraid ; " then she adds in a whisper, " she
reveres you too much to speak familiarly
before you yet, but love will soon cast out
fear when you are her father."

Very proper, nice feeling on her part, I
am sure," the Bishop says, benignly. To
tell the truth, reverence is not precisely
the sentiment with which he himself fancies
he has inspired his pretty widow's handsome
daughter. Nor, indeed, to do him justice,
does he desire to insist upon a display of
filial feeling from the young lady. But,
for the future, his ways and wishes will be
moulded and guided by a stronger hand
than his own, and, like a man, he prepares
to bow to the inevitable.

So Mrs. Heatherley trips along after
Ethel, who walks rapidly to a recess in
the high laurel hedge, where she stops, and
begins at once 

I have broken off my engagement with
Walter Gilford to-day, mother ; don't ask
me why I have done it, and don't build
any fallacious hopes upon it. I have done
it! and I'm more unhappy than I ever
thought it possible I could be ; but I don't
want to go back to AUerton Towers. I
would rather go away where no one will
over speculate about me and my lost happiness."


My darling, you will be rewarded for
this obedience to my wishes, and to the
dictates of common sense, by meeting with
one who will make yOur lot a far happier
one than it could ever have been as
Mr. Gifford's wife," Mrs. Heatherley says,
rapturously ; but Ethel shakes her head
and says 

"No, mother, you will be burdened with
me all my life, or rather the Bishop will be ;
I won't let myself fancy anything so evil
as that you will ever wish me away from
you."

Again the maternal instinct is aroused,
and tears of genuine feeling for her daughter

VOL. 1. M

well up into Mrs. Heatherley's bright blue
eyes. But when she speaks there is a
nervous quiver in her voice that sounds
more like fear than love.

I shall never know a moment's peace,
Ethel, my darling, till you are well married,
and removed from the possibility of any
change in my fortunes affecting you."
Ethel smiles sadly.

My dear little mother, for your sake the
Bishop won't grudge me a corner in the
Palace, and, if he does, why shouldn't I
live on at the cottage ? "

There are many reasons why ; but it's
ridiculous to talk seriously in this strain,"
Mrs. Heatherley says, sharply ; and for a few
moments she looks quite middle-aged and
haggard. Then with an effort she resumes
her youth and gaiety, and runs back to the
Bishop as if her feet were not shackled,
and her brow burdened with a weight of
secret care.

I must tell you the good news at once ;
my dear child has made me quite happy by
freeing herself from that foolish entanglement

with the young surgeon," she says, sliding
her hand under the Bishop's arm.

It was not a regular engagement, I understand?"
he asks, and she tells him 

Oh, no ! a foolish arrangement between
two thoughtless young people, of which I
never could approve ; his connections are
not in our class of life at all, I should say,
from the little I saw of his sister."

I can never bring myself to countenance
a breach of such a solemn thiner as a
regular, authorised, sensible engagement,"
his lordship says, sternly. Then, having
asserted his prerogative to judge and condemn,
he relapses into affability, and expresses
a hope that Lord Kenmare will
now catch Ethel's heart in the rebound.

"I shall certainly advise him to seize this
golden opportunity," he says ; and Mrs.
Heatherley, who dreads the effect of anything
like interference on his part, is obliged
to entreat him to observe the golden rule
of silence when Ethel's heart affairs are
concerned.

In Toot time it will all arrange itself,

I am sure," she says, confidently, for she
does not dare to allow herself to doubt
and fear about Ethel's future. If her
daughter does not make a wealthy marriage,
with a man who will for love of Ethel be
both liberal and discreet, the blithe little
widow, who has always passed for a
wealthy one in Atherton Towers society,
will be poor indeed.

Lord Kenmare has not accompanied them
to Boyne Gate. A letter from his father,
peremptorily demanding his son's immediate
presence at Sir John Hawtrey's house hard
by, has relieved Ethel from the embarrassing
daily intercourse with the young man whom
she has refused to marry, but whom lie
likes with a warmer liking than she has for
anyone else on earth, excepting Walter
Gilford !

She must not be thought either inconsistent
or fickle, when it is said of her that there has
been so much sweetness in this daily intercourse
that she misses it very sadly now that it
is over. There are moments when she longs
for his presence again, longs to hear his ardent

adoriiior words, that will not be silenced ;
longs to see his boyishly frank displayed of
desperate regard for her ; longs, in fact, for
the sight of " the only one who is true
and loyal and staunch to her," as she tells
herself, thinking sorrowfully of Walter.

It must be admitted that life is not very
lively at Boyne Gate. Lady St. Just having
failed in bringing matters to a successful issue
between Lord Kenmare and Ethel, and being
rather annoyed than otherwise at her old
friend, the Bishop, having suffered himself to
fall captive to Mrs. Heatherley's bow and
spear, is rather tired of this family party
which she has brought upon herself. If
Ethel would only be sensible, and accept the
love that is offered to her, Lady St. Just
would take the credit of making the match to
herself next season, and feel pride and pleasure.
But as Ethel is contumacious, there is
a flatness about the group, which falls upon
Lady St. Just, who revenges herself by being
so depressing that even the Bishop feels that
the atmosphere of his Palace is exhilarating
by comparison.

I can't help thinking that our friend is
expecting a fresh relay of guests ; possibly it
may not suit her arrangements to have us
here any longer," he hints to his bride-elect.
But she, having her own reasons for staying
away from Atherton Towers until her wedding-day
is near at hand, tells him that " for her
child's sake she has resolved to stay and
meet and conquer Lord Monkstown."

It is a little thing to Mrs. Heatherley, who
has large things at stake, that her august
hostess should be obviously tired of her and
her future spouse.

He is heavy, deadly heavy, when he
emerges from the cloudy splendour of bishop-hood,
and becomes a mere man, affecting
harmless sprightliness," Mrs. Heatherley says
to herself, with a laugh and a shrug of the
pretty supple shoulders  whose undulations
the Bishop is observing at the moment with
admiring eyes  " but I shall have to endure
the burden of being bored by him so long as
we both do live. Why shouldn't Ladj St.
Just have a sensation of what I shall have to
bear ? Ethel and I compensate her amply for

Fanny's cautious insipidity, and her father's
excellent uninterestingness," So for the sake
of a certain something, which she does not
confide either to her child Ethel, or her
captive Bishop, Mrs. Heatherley puts her
pride aside, and stays on where she is
obviously not wanted.

Success appears about to crown her in one
direction, at least, when she hears that on the
following day " six guns," chosen for their
well-known prowess over turnip fields and
against partridges, are going out from Boyne
Gate for a hard day's work, and that their
arduous labours are to be relieved by the
ladies and luncheon at Bale Coppice at half-past
one. For among these six are the
Marquis of Monkstown and his son, Lord
Kenmare.

"I hear that Lord Monkstown is a sweet
old man," Mrs. Heatherley says to the Bishop
; " and [I am sure when he sees Ethel,
and finds how perfectly she behaves, never
giving Kenmare the slightest encouragement
to make love to her, and yet showing her
liking for him in such a pretty, frank way,

I an surf quite, quite sure lai he "veil]
?:Tip:>r: his son's suit, and thai our daring
Ziiiel will be made happy almost against
her will

~ A Higher Power than ours directs these
times," the Bishop sars. with the impressive
tcaae that is pronounced to be ** ver teOing "
by his admirers when he is divine a Charge
ful] of flawless commonplaces. Bat at the
same time, despite this verbal expressed of
pious radiance, be is clad that Mrs, Heatberiey
will have such an excellent opportunity of
loing a mundane hand towards the fcH"-
mjUicm of so gratifying a connection.

There is a sort of tacit agreement between
Lady Jst. Just and Mrs. Heatherley to the
effect that Ethel shall not be told that Lcwd
Kemnare and his father will leet them at
Bale Coppice this day. Accordingly, Ethel
aDoviB herds to be bent and moored to
thor wishes and wHls without a murmur.
There is a good deal of the managing faculty
required in order to tranKHt the home
party to the trysting-place oomlbitafafy and
consistently. It is clear to the most; <nqae

secular mind that the gaiters and hat of a
bishop must not be shown to the eye of
dissent (which prevails in these parts) descending
Iron a little Norfolk cart. Therefore
sirs. Heatherley is compelled to accompany
the wearer of these honourable but oppressive
insignia in the landau with Lady St. Just,
instead of going, as her taste would dictate,
in the Norfolk cart drawn by the sporting-looking
Httle cob which is driven by Ethel.

And to make matters worse, it seems, fate
decrees that, for the greater convenience of
the greater number, Fanny Templeton shall
be Ethel companion. Fanny Templeton,
who will squeeze herself into every little
crevice of an opportunity which judicious
management may make for Kenmare to have
uninterrupted intercourse with Ethel. Mrs.
Heatherley's brow darkens and her eyes glare
at her future step-daughter, as Fanny takes
her place  and Fanny's intuition tells her the
reason why.

Your mamma is' afraid I shall be in your
way. dear." she says, at once, and Ethel,
taking her literally, replies 

Oh ! nonsense ; there's plenty of room -
room for one behind as far as that goes ; Mr.
Grove, why don't you come with us ? "
she cries out, as the chaplain is preparing
to step into the landau, and without hesitation
Mr. Grove turns and accepts the
invitation.

For a few minutes Fanny is silenced by this
move on the board, but as they dash out into
the lane which leads to Bale Coppice she
recovers her wonted equanimity, and power
of uttering that which is most likely to
discompose her audience.

"I am feeling quite anxious to see Lord
Monkstown, are not you, Ethel? They
say he's such a fascinating, courtly old gentleman,
and as handsome, even now, as Lord
Benares''

The cob bends his nose in half an inch
more, and steps out a thought quicker, thus
indicating that he has felt a sudden pressure
on his bit. This is the only sign given that
the name so lightly mentioned has gone home
to the heart of the hearer.

"Is Lord Monkstown one of the party?"

Ethel asks, holding her face well round for
Miss Templeton's inspection.

Why ; yes, of course, you know that both
he and Kenmare are here," Fanny rejoins, and
at the same moment the cob swerves sharply
round a corner close to the coppice.

BALE COPPICE.

[[jSpHE cob has distanced his more majestic
stable brethren in the landau,
and the consequence is, Ethel finds
herself dashing up to the group of six expectant,
hungry men, with the air of being
so eager to join them that she has outstripped
conventionality, and left her chaperone behind
her.

The clear, bright, dark face lights up
radiantly, and the soft, dark velvet eyes are
lustrous with a variety of deeply-stirred
feelings, as, foremost among the group of
men, the girl recognises Lord Kenmare.
She cannot help feeling pleased at the warm
pleasure with which he comes to greet her.
She cannot help feeling flattered at the flattering
heart-and-lip-homage he renders her.
She cannot help being proud of the pride
he takes in showing all those who care to

see it, that his devotion to Ethel Heath erle
is unaltered.

He is by the side of the Norfolk cart the
moment; the cob stops, doffing his hat low
to the young lady, whose pretty blushes
might pass for the red flag of love in the
eyes of one less keen to detect the truth
than he is.

May I introduce my father to you ? " he
asks, and presently Ethel feels her hand taken
very kindly by a handsome old gentleman,
who is merely a splendidly-matured edition
of Kenmare.

This is the obstacle to my wishes with
regard to Caroline," Lord Monkstown thinks,
and he resolves to ignore Kenmare's infatuation
altogether, since the latter has never
confided the name of the object of it to the
paternal ear.

The boy wears his heart upon his sleeve,"
the father says to himself, as Ethel springs
out of the trap, and Kenmare at once endeavours
to draw her away from the others
to look at a view of Boyne Gate from the
other end of the coppice." But Lord Monks-town

does not think this angrily, by any
means. He is not displeased that his son's
first serious heart-affection should have been
given him by a girl who would so gracefully
wear the title and coronet of a marchioness
as Ethel. " It must never be with Kenmare,
but she amply justifies the boy's admiration
for her, and desire to have her," the old
nobleman  who prides himself upon estimating
women correctly, and specially plumes
himself on the aptitude of his power of discerning
whether or not they are fitted by
nature and habit to hold high places  thinks.

It must never be with Kenmare ; but

if he gets over it, or rather when he gets
over it"  Lord Monkstown checks even his
thoughts at this juncture, but they have
run away with him far enough for it to be
nearly a certainty that if Ethel is ambitious
only, her ambition may be gratified by
another than Kenmare !

That something of this is shadowed forth
in the long, admiring gaze which the old
gentleman sends after the supple, erect figure
which is stepping along so lightly in the

distance by the side of his son, may be
gathered from the fact that Fanny Templeton
feels impelled to say as soon as an introduction
enables her to address Lord Monkstown :

Have you never seen my pretty friend
before ? "

I have never had the pleasure of meeting
Miss Heatherley until to day," he replies.

Ah ! your son has the advantage of you
in that respect at least," Fanny says, putting
on a look of tender regard for the young girl,
whom she would willingly obliterate from the
face of the earth at the present moment, were
such a course feasible without unpleasant
results to herself. Then, as Lord Monkstown
acquiesces in her statement that his own son
has the advantage of him, Fanny goes on 

Lord Kenmare and Miss Heatherley are
quite old friends, and would have been something
more, I have heard, if it had not been
for the prior claims of Mr. Walter Gifford."

Indeed ! "  Lord Monkstown startled a
little, not as Fanny supposes by the suggestion
that his son has been in love with Ethel,
but by the idea of any other man being fortunate

enough to have a prior claim to her 
"indeed! and who is Mr. Walter GifFord?"

A surgeon in practice in Atherton Towers,
a good sort of young man, I believe, not that
I know anything of him, for, of course, he's
not in our set''

At the same time you are so intimate
with his fiancee. ""

Lord Monkstown put it in this way, hoping
that he may be told immediately that Ethel
is not a fiancee, but the feline Fanny has no
intention of putting the noble mover out
of pain or suspense quickly.

I am so intimate with his fiancee, because
her mother and the Bishop, my father, are
going to be foolish enough to marry one
another in their old age. Then she remembers
that Lord Monkstown must be the
Bishop's senior by many a long year, and
adds an amendment :

"Xot that my father's age is against the
wisdom of the intention, I don't think that
for a moment ; but Mrs. Heatherley is
certainly long past the age at which it might
have been easy to tear her from the habits

to which she is wedded, and mould her to
a new manner of life."

There is nothings that can be said against
Mrs. Heatherley's prudence ; she has shown it
in accepting the Bishop," the Marquis says,
smiling, and, as he speaks, the landau with its
highly esteemed cargo comes lumbering up
respectably, and kind little Fanny is unable
to put any more pins into the noble pincushion
for the time.

As soon as Mrs. Heatherley comes into
collision with Lord Monkstown, she understands
that she must renounce her intention
of creating a paternal regard for Ethel in his
heart. He is no " heavy father " to hold out
against the projected union of the young
people, for whom she is scheming, for a
time, and then to endow them with countless
thousands and his blessing. He is, on the
contrary, a fine, handsome, rather vain;
attractive, rather selfish man, who banishes
his age as much from his own mind, and
from the sight of other people, as possible.
A man in whom the pride of life is still
strong enough for it to be extremely pro-vol.

I. K

table that lie will prefer having a beautiful,
penniless young wife for himself, to permitting
his son to enjoy the luxury.

All this is so patent to Mrs. Heatherley,
that she, being in her own eyes a still young
and remarkably pretty woman, is almost disposed
to regret that the proclamation of her
victory over the Bishop has gone forth. Her
unfailing instinct for the fitness of things tells
her that she would have made a better marchioness
than she will a bishop-less. But as
this is not in the alterable order of things,
Mrs. Heatherley makes up her mind to
succumb to the inevitable, graciously and
gracefully.

She still has a trump card in her hand!
"Ethel is the most marriageable girl I ever
saw in my life, if she can only be induced to
marry," she tells herself; and then she looks
at the Marquis and makes plans !

Dear old man !  so distin2:uished-lookinii !
After all, there's nothing finer on the face of
the earth than a real Irish gentleman. And
the Marquis of Monkstown may safely chap
lege criticism. An old man's darling.

What better fortune for a fortuneless girl can
be desired? An old man's darling ! And that
old man a venerable Adonis and a marquis ! "

"My daughter is such a perfect child of
nature, that she forgets other people may-animadvert
upon her conduct ; she treats
Lord Kenmare with the simple familiarity
she would show towards a younger brother ;
forgetting that unkind eyes may see more
in her manner than she means, and unkind
tongues mention it."

Mrs. Heatherley says this in plaintively
apologetic accents to Lord Monkstown, in a
brief interval  during which she has him 'entirely
to herself  while the luncheon is being
spread. It is not through neglecting the
Bishop that this opportunity arises, but rather
that he is allowing himself to be absorbed by
a communication his daughter has just made
to him,

"Papa," Fanny says, as she sees Mrs.
Heatherley preparing to melt Lord Monks-town,
" I want to show you a fern that we
ought to have for our grates, it spreads so
beautifully." Then, while the Bishop is looked



ing in blind confidence for the fern, in the
direction his daughter indicates, she stabs him
ruthlessly :

Papa, do you know that woman is
hopelessly, irretrievably, scandalously in
debt ? "

I don't believe  I mean what woman are
you speaking about ? " he says, wincing pitifully
under the pain, but struggling still to
preserve an air of composure.

You know I can only mean Mrs. Feathered."


And you know Mrs. Heatherley is to be
my wife, Fanny ; I can't listen to gossip
about her, even from you."

But the gossip is true, papa ; I have
heard to-day, on excellent authority, that
Mrs. H. coverley is only marrying you
because she has wasted her daughter's substance
and her own ; she is nothing better
than an extravagant pauper."

It would be treason to myself were I to
listen to such an evil report," the Bishop
says, strengthening himself in his determination
to be staunch by the reflection that he

is too firmly in Mrs. Heatlierley's clutches
ever to hope to get out of them.

It is worse treason to yourself to turn
a deaf ear to what I tell you, papa," Fanny
persists, and to do her justice, she has good
grounds for what she says, and is not
actuated by an unkindly spirit towards Mrs.
Heatherley only. It is gall and wormwood
to her to think of the widow as the presiding
genius of the Palace, but there is
worse bitterness in the thought that the
widow will bring no grist to the mill.

At any rate, enquire into her affairs
before you take the fatal step, papa," she
urges, and the Bishop, who has a quiet
conviction that he is going to his doom in
making this marriage, promises her that he
will " be cautious."

"At the same time, understand that I
have every confidence  every confidence in
Mrs. Heatherley," he says, emphatically 
so emphatically, in fact, that he almost
believes himself. But his daughter knows
better, and in the unconvinced toss her
head gives there is another dagger-thrust.

Meanwhile Ethel and Lord Kenmare are
looking at the view on the sheltered side

o

of Bale Coppice.

Did you think I should be here to-day ? "
he asks, when they have rounded a corner
and found a bank thickly-cushioned with
moss, to sit down upon.

I didn't think about you before I
started."

But, after you had started, did I come
into your head at all ? Give me that much
pleasure at least  say you thought I should
be here, and still you came."

You were put into my head by Fanny
Temple ton ; she told me just as we drove
up to you, that ' of course I knew both your
father and you were here ! I didn't know,
but that was her way of putting it."

I hope you'll like my father."

I hope I shall," Ethel says, politely. It
does not seem a matter of vital consequence
whether she likes his father or not, but, ashe
wishes it, she does not feel disposed to
cavil at the expression of his desire.

"Yes," the young man goes on, I hope

with all my heart you'll like my father,
because if you do he'll soon think all the
world of you, and the other will be nowhere."


I don't want him to think all the world
of me'' Ethel says, anxiously ; " it would be
such a pity, such a waste you know, if he
did ! And who's the other one ? "

Oh ! I forgot you didn't know about
my cousin, Caroline Hatred' ; she's the
governor's craze ; she's an heiress, and she's
his niece, and she's destined by both her own
father and mine to be Lady Kenmare ; and,
look here, Ethel, whether you will in time,
or not, I don't mean to have it."

"To have what?"

"You know what  Caroline for my wife;
she's a good little thing, meek, and gentle,
and nice-looking ; but, after seeing you, and
seeing what I do in you, I cannot see anything
in her stronii enough to blot you
out."

I think most men fall in love two or
three times, in a fanciful way, before they
meet the women they marry,"

I think I've heard that remark made
before," he laughs. "Miss Heatherley, even
when you try to be tame and trite you're
more interesting than any other girL"

I have not been sufficiently interesting
to Mr. Gifford to keep him true to me,"
she says, sorrowfully. " Just think ; I'm
as fond of him as you are of anybody,
and I've had to give him up because he
has seen a girl he likes better than me."

I don't believe it."

"Do you mean you don't believe he's
tired of me ? " she asks, eagerly.

Yes, that's what I do mean ; I wish I
could run him down with all my heart ; I
wish I could dare to say that I think him
a hound. But I don't, you see ; if anyone
has told you that he's tired of you
and that he likes someone else better, that
someone must have lied, because he
couldn't, you know !  the thing isn't inman
' to do.' "

I think you're better than anyone else,
you're nobler ; you can't imagine low, false
things ; oh ! you are so true, and you are

?o generous ! " Ethel says, vigorously, and,
instantly, she wishes she had not said it,
for Lord Kenmare takes heart of grace
from her encouragement to say :

You never say a thing you don't mean,
I've found that out ' about you ; and so, as
you mean you think all these good things of
me  can't you, ccmt you love me, dear ? "

I wish I could  I am an unfortunate girl,
I think, Lord Kenmare," she says, with a
sweet seriousness that appeals to all that is
noblest in his noble nature. "' At least," she
adds, hurriedly, as if she fears she were doing
injustice to someone, ' I seem to be unfortunate
just now, but, perhaps, it's only seeming
; the two people I think most of in the
world  the two I love the best and want to
trust the most, 'seem' to be getting away
from me."

"And one of these is this Mr. Gifford?"
he asks, with kindly curiosity.

Yes, one of them is ' this Mr. Gifford,' as
you choose to call him," Ethel says, perking
her head up in proud deprecation of the
depreciation which is implied in that word

*' only ; " " and that he should fall off, or
seem weak and wanting, is a trouble heavy-enough
to embitter my life, for I thought
him higher than myself, you know, and  "

She pauses suddenly, and a light, as of a
new revelation, springs up into her face.

I forgot," she whispers, bending her
pretty head, with pretty modesty, " I forgot
! the one who has taken him from me
may be so much better than me, that it
was only right of him to go."

This is a view of the case whicli Kenmare
cannot combat. When Ethel is lowly, she is
a beloved but still an overwhelming burden.

"But it can never be made to look right
that mother should marry the Bishop," Ethel
goes on, looking him direct in the face, in a
way that makes him feel that it will be idle
on his part to utter a mere platitude. " It
will always look a strained and incongruous
arrangement  and it will be worse than it
looks. And I can't bear it, for I love my
mother."

She is a free agent," Lord Kenmare
remarks, suggestively. He is afraid to assert

anything, yet he wishes to show that he hasa
healthy yearning for information on all
points that concern Miss Heatherley.

Yes  mother's a free agent, as far as
being well-off and quite independent of everyone
goes ; but mother has a very gentle and
reliant nature  oh ! she's ever so much more
inclined to yield and to lean upon people
than I am."

"And the Bishop is a good, massive
leaning-post ! "

That's just it ; dear mother has lived her
graceful, unprotected life long enough for her
to have gained reliance on herself; but, somehow
or other, she hasn't got it ; she's afraid
of what people may say of her and of
me ! as if it mattered ! and she fancies when
she is the Bishop's wife that we shall both
be founded on a rock."

If I were you I wouldn't fret myself
about my mother's marriage. The Bishop's
worst fault, as far as I can see, is that he's
a deuced nuisance to talk to; and, if your
mother can stand that, you needn't worry
yourself about it, need you ? "

I often wonder what people go on talking
about all through the long years  forever
so long  for so long as they both do
live  as, when they're married, and all the
furniture is got, and they know who's going
to call and who isn't, there can't be much
more to say ; " and he replies, with the
decision that is an attribute of his age 

"They don't talk to each other, you know."

Do you mean that husbands and wives
don't talk to each other ? "

Not as a rule  but  you and your
husband will be an exception ; I could goon
talking with you for ever without feeling
tired, or thinking that a change would be
pleasant."

Ah ! but you're not my husband," she
says, lightly ; " and if you were we should
soon wear the topics we have in common,
threadbare ; now, with a man who had a profession,
it would be different. I should take
an interest in his cases, and speak about
them "

Is there any path in life that I can

tread that will awake interest enough in j-ou

to make me follow it," he interrupts, eagerly ;
I'll go in for politics with my whole heart
if you'll put a bit of heart into my doing
so''

If I weighed with you for a moment 
if you thought of me when you went into
the strife, your whole heart wouldn't be in
your work, therefore you'd do it badly."

May I not hope to touch a noble aim, and
then lay fondly at your feet the fulness of my
fame?" he asks, and then Ethel gives him
a sharp thrust with the sword of commonsense.


If your father knew the way in which
you are misusing your privileges, how angry
he would be with you and with me ; and
don't make him angry with me  I want him
to like me."

For my sake ? " he mutters.

No, not for your sake at all ; but because
he's a grander gentleman than I've ever seen
before, and so I should like him to like me,
and make much of me, for my own sake."

The girl is very much in earnest, and only
a little in jest, in saying this. Nevertheless,

it startles and almost hurts her when he
answers, gravely :

I hope and trust that it may be for your
'own sake,' for your sake will be mine."

Even as he says this, the old Marquis
rounds the corner of the coppice, escorted by
Mrs. Heatherley and Fanny Templeton. The
Bishop would not come " because the wasps
worry him," they explain ; and Lady St. Just
wishes the elaborately-prepared luncheon to
be eaten without further delay. But Ethel
cannot help feeling that neither the importunity
of the wasps assailing, as they do, the
current comfort of a Bishop, nor the urgency
of the case as regards the luncheon, would
have brought Lord Monkstown round the
coppice corner in search of her.

For whose sake, and in whose interest,
then has he come?"

Mrs. Heatherley nurtures a hope, and Ethel
strives to banish a thought, that both tend
to the same point.

He is more struck with my child than I
could have believed a man would be, accustomed
to the society of the most loveliest

women in London," Mrs. Heatlierley thinks,
exultantly, and at the same time Ethel, struck
by the expression of her mother's face, is
telling herself 

Mother is putting the father in the place
she wanted the son to fill the other day ! I
hope he won't make an old goose of himself
and meet her views, and make my hard lot
harder than it is already. Oh, Walter ! if
other men are ready to love me, why couldn't
you go on doing it?"

But while she is saying this to herself, she
is listening very attractively to the information
Lord Monkstown is giving her about Boyne
Gate. He is telling her how it came into the
family generations ago, when a Baron Monks-town
(this was before they were prompted
marquises) had fallen in love with a pretty
English oirl, who turned out the heiress of
Place," as the estate was called then, and
who returned her Irish lover's affection with
such romantic fervour, that she insisted on
chancing: the name of the estate of her
fathers to Boyne Gate.

This is the first time it has ever been lethe

goes on to explain; "hitherto it has always
been used as a dower-house ; but, as I am
unfortunate enough to have survived my wife,
I have let St. Just have it for two or three
shooting seasons."

It's the only place you have in England,
isn't it ? " Ethel asks, for the sake of saying
something. To her embarrassment, Lord
Monkstown has succeeded in lagging behind
the others, and courtesy has compelled her to
stay and listen to his explanation ; therefore
she seems to be lagging, too.

Yes ; the only place I have in England,
with the exception of a little house in Norfolk
Street, that is scarcely worth speaking of, as
it is only fit for bachelor's quarters."

Mother has a house in Norfolk Street,
too," Ethel says.

"Has she? Do you go to it for the season?
Perhaps I shall be fortunate enough to have
you for neighbours, if you go up for the
winter gaiety ! "What is your number ? "

Ethel tells him, and he exclaims  " Are
you sure? that is very strange, for it's my
number ! "

Yes, I am quite sure. We haven't been
up for three years, but I can't be stupid
enough to have forgotten the number."

"I bought it three years ago," he says,
quietly ; " perhaps your mamma may have
sold it to me."

Oh, no ! I'm sure she hasn't, because she
was speaking of her London house property
the other day to the Bishop," Ethel says, with
an air of conviction. Still, the subject seems
to dwell in her mind with undue weight ; for,
when they are all settled into place around
the luncheon-cloth, she says to Mrs. Heatherley,
who is opposite 

"Mother, isn't it odd? Lord Monkstown
has a house in Norfolk Street, and its number
is the same as ours ? "

In a moment each pair of eyes present are
bent questioningly on Mrs. Heatherley, into
whose pretty, fair face, a deeper tint comes
for a moment, but there is not a touch of
confusion in the way in which she answers
promptly :

It would ' be odd,' dear, if our house had
not a distinguishing letter added to the num-vol.

I. O

ber." Then with the easiest grace she turns
the conversation into another channel, along
which, with ready courtesy, Lord Monkstown
aids her to glide, and helpfully accompanies
her. But all the while he is thinking
That woman has parted with her property,
and has her own reasons for keeping quiet
about it."

The same thought enters into Miss Templeton's
mind, and the Bishop groans in spirit ashe
skies a furtive o-lance at her, and sees the
expression of malignant meekness which is
lighting up her face. " I shall hear of this
most unfortunate coincidence from Fanny,"
he says to himself, and mentally he resolves
to " keep Grove close to him all the day."

But his precaution, though he fully carries
it out, is of no avail. For the remainder of
the day he is protected from the assault of
daughterly-devotion, by his chaplain and the
home circle generally ; but as soon as he is
left alone on his defenceless pillow at night,
his loved, but dreaded Fanny, takes him
unawares, and reduces him to a state of
abject misery :

Papa," she whispers, creeping in with a
little lamp in her hand, and her dressing-gown
on, " I waited till I heard Perkins go
away to the servants' wing, and then, as 1
couldn't sleep, I crept down. Did you hear
that at luncheon ? "

Did I hear what ? " he says, in a spirit of
feeble prevarication,

Why, about the house in Norfolk Street ?
Don't you think that if it had been hers still,
she would have said more than she did about
the coincidence of the numbers being the
same ? Of course she would ! Isn't she just
the person to have twisted it into a link
between herself and that old Marquis ! Oh !
papa, don't be weak ; do inquire into the
state of her affairs ! In justice to me, don't
hamper yourself with Mrs. Heatherley and
her daughter, till you find that they can pay
their own way."

The Bishop is frightened, undoubtedly
frightened, by this fierce appeal to his paternal
sense of justice, and his commonsense
and honourable spirit of detestation of monetary
entanglements. At the same time,

o2

frightened as he is about her, he is resolved
to be very loyal to the best-looking, and most
fascinating woman who has ever taken the
trouble to show herself at her best before,
and exercise her fascination to the utmost
upon him.

'' A pledge to marry is a very solemn thing,
and the consideration of mere dross must
not be permitted to interfere with its fulfilment,"
he says, with as reverential, and at the
same time august an air as he can manage,
prostrate beneath the bed-clothes, with something
suspiciously like a night-cap on.

But Fanny is inexorable. The attempt at
being reverential and august does not strike
awe into her heart for a moment :

Nonsense, papa," she says, with emphasis,
it may be ' mere dross,' but you know how
it upsets you to be short of it."

A PLOT.

jiALTEE Gifford has not confided

  the contents or nature of that

fatal little note of Ethel's . to a

single human being. It is always in his

pocket and his thoughts ; but he speaks

of it to no one.

Nevertheless his sister knows as well as he
does himself, that her shot has told, and that
he has received his dismissal from Ethel
Heatherley. And still, though she knows
this, she is not happy!

Honestly and truly the disingenuous and
cruel course she has taken, has been taken
solely in what she mistakenly believes to
be her brother's best interests. Therefore,
it is disappointing and disheartening to her
to see him glooming so terribly, now that
she has won freedom for him, instead of
making the highest use of that freedom,

and seeking the love which Lily Somerset
is willing to give him.

To do Lily Somerset justice, there has
never been a moment during which she has
displayed maidenly zeal to win him, since
that interview between them which has been
already recorded. On the contrary, she has
rather stood aloof from him, being very
kind and cordial when they are together,
but never taking the turning's in the direction
in which he may come, and never
asking him when " he will come again," as
the manner is of women, when the yearning
for the society of the beloved object has
overcome all reticence.

Now this, in Miss Gifford's simple
and unsuspicious eyes, looks too much
indifference for her to let it pass uncommented
upon long. Just as everything else
seems to be en train for success, it is a
little too trying to worthy Mabel that Lily
should suddenly become careless and dis-encouraging.


It seems to me that Walter may go or
come, or stay away, so far as you're concerned,"

she says, plucking up heart of
grace to speak her mind for the cause that
is so dear to her, even at the risk of
offending her resplendent young tyrant.

He certainly may go and come as he
likes, without let or hindrance from me,"
Lily laughs.

You don't tell me that you're tired of 
of thinking of him ? " Mabel asks, aghast.

' Well, not that, certainly ; but I am tired
of plodding on in my way, and of seeing him
plod on in his. I want to see some startling
change come to one of us. If I got suddenly
poor, and he got suddenly rich, your brother
would be so charged with pity and old associations
about unworthy me, that  I don't
know what might not happen ; now, I am not
likely to get suddenly poor, but I am considering
in my own mind how it would be
possible to put him in such a position, as
would compel him to put forth all his powers;
at present his practice is not engrossing
enough, or important enough. He moves
by inches ; he thinks he is working hard,
whereas he is nearly exhausting his energies

in rolling a heavy ball filled with littleness
up a steep hill."

As well as she can, Mabel follows the drift
of these remarks, and as clearly as she can,
extracts the meaning from them. Still, being
human, she is liable to error, and she errs
now in the deduction she draws.

"You mean that poor Walter ought to
work harder, and make more money than he
does "  she is beginning, when Lily interrupts
her, sharply 

I mean nothing of the kind. I mean
that working chiefly as he does among a
class who are not deemed of sufficient importance
by their generous-minded fellow-creatures
to have their well or ill-doing
chronicled, and published, and wondered
about  is like burrowing in the earth. I
want him to come out into open places, and
exercise his noble art upon those who are
able to make him celebrated ! I would not
wish him to be anything more than he is
a good man, working well by stealth.
But, for his own sake, for the sake of the
restoration to health of his broken, weakened

ambition, I would wish to see him a great
man, Mab, and, if I tell you how he can
become one, will you keep the secret ? "

Of course Mabel promises, but she does
it with a misgiving heart. It may be in
irresistible Lily's mind to carry Walter off
to. the altar, and marry him by force, the
alarmed sister fears, and, if so !  how about
the penalties which will befall those who
are accessory to the deed ?

Still the force of habit is upon her, and
she promises !  hoping for the best.

Then for the first time in their intercourse,
she sees Lily timid, and uncertain of herself.

My plan is this  if you think it wise  "

Mabel starts so violently at this unwonted
recognition of, and appeal to her wisdom,
that Lily pauses to say, with a brief relapse
into imperiousness  "Don't jump, and be
absurd. If you think it wise, an opportunity
offers itself, which, if taken, will put
your brother in such a position that he will
be compelled to be famous, and forced to
blot out all the undermining memories and
disappointments he nourishes and broods

upon now. If you think it wise  that
is, if you'll only say you're glad about
it  I don't want any opinion from you,
you know, Mab  Walter will have Dr.
Laughton's practice, and with it he will
take the onus upon himself of maintaining
Dr. Laughton's magnificent reputation, and
of justifying Dr. Laughton's acceptance of
him as a successor."

But, Lily, what can make Dr. Laughton
give it up to Walter?" Mabel gasps,
for Dr. Laughton is a prince among practitioners,
the nodding of whose head,
and the uplifting of whose eyebrows, puts
fifty guineas in his own purse.

Money, you goose, money ! " Lily says,
with a great assumption of superior worldly-wisdom,
"and that's just the part of it that
you are to keep quite secret ; the money
has been found, and the matter has been
arranged ; and now all that remains to
be done is for Dr. Laughton to introduce
Walter to his most important patients."

Walter will never agree to it," Mabel
cries, startled out of her customary awe

of, and implicit, unquestioning obedience
to aught that Lily decrees. " Walter will
feel that he hasn't worked his way to it,
and that it's your money has bought it,
and, feeling that !  no Lily ! I couldn't wish
my brother to have so little spirit as to take
it, grand as it would be."

Lily tries to fly into a passion, and fails
in doing so for once in her life. Li place
of passion, scalding tears, the offspring of
based, really good feeling, run down
unbecomingly.

"How can you tell, how can you be so
silly as to think, or to say that it is my
money that has done it? How do yon
know that Walter hasn't other friends as
willing to spend money upon him as I amor,
rather, as I would be if he needed it?
Besides, how do you know that there's
any money passed in the business at all?
Dr. Laughton thinks an enormous deal of
Walter's abilities ; how can you say that, as
Dr. Laughton is an old man, he hasn't been
glad to give the good-will, or whatever they
call it, to a worthy young successor ? "

"I should like to think it," Mabel meditates
aloud ; then she reminds herself-and
Lily that 

You told me it was ' money ' made
Dr. Laughton give it up yourself, Lily,
and oh ! what shall I do when Walter taxes
me with having deceived him, and reproaches
me with not having thought of his dignity
a little more. He will think it shocking,
and quite a thing that it would be impossible
for a man of honour to do, to take
money for his own advantage from a
woman ; it would be different if you were
old and ugly, my dear, indeed, it would !
But, I could never look my brother in the
face again, if I pretended to think he
would take such a great benefit from you."

I can't be old and ugly all at once, can
I ? " Lily says, trying to speak in a petulant
way, that she has frequently found efficacious
in bringing Mabel into prompt acquiescence
with her view of things. But to-day the
petulance fails her! The "reality" of
something higher and better than gratified
ambition or rewarded love, is forced upon

her. Faint and uncertain as these outlines,
drawn by his faltering, frightened sister's
hand, are, Lily sees something of the grand
hasting, resting " nature which she
has been selfishly seeking to shackle with
her little chains of gold.

"I can't be old and ugly all at once,"
she repeats, sorrowfully ; " but it will wither
me if what I have done lowers him in his
own eyes  it can't in the eyes of anyone
else." Then, with a quick change to indignation,
at being misunderstood and trapped
into making disclosures, she adds :

"And, how can you dare to say that it
has been done in a way that could hurt
the feelings of the proudest and most sensitively
honourable man in the world ?  and,
even admitting that it has been done, who can
say  who can tell him  that / did it ? "

"Oh, Lily! your conscience accuses you,
and your face betrays you," Mabel says,
pushing her victory over filthy lucre to the
utmost ; " it would have been too terrible if
my brother had fallen into such a trap for
want of a word in season from me."

The supreme moment is over ! and Lily is
disgusted at the aspect of the generous action
she has contemplated performing, when held
up in this cold, rather coarse light.

Don't waste any more seasonable words
on me, Mabel ; I know you're half right, and
I am more than half wrong ; still ! what I've
done, or wanted to do, won't be altogether
so bad as to make me take the whole of the
consequences to myself; get Dr. Laughton
to be off his bargain  if you can ; but, if
ever you wish to speak to me after to-day,
don't breathe a word of this to your brother
or, to me after now, when I close the
subject, and fan it away!"

The way in which Lily wafts a huge,
black, Spanish fan backwards and forwards,
in a royally-fatigued, languishing way, as she
says this, brings Mabel back into subjection,
promptly.

That you should be upset about either
Walter or me  not but that Walter's worth a
dozen of any other man / ever met With  "

"You've not met many"  this from the
fairy tyrant.

No, perhaps not, and the fewer the better
for me and all other women, I say ; but that's
neither here nor there, and what I want to
say shortly is  if you think of Walter rightly
you'll think that he is too high already in
the right way for either of us to help him
with mere money and good introductions ; a
peer's case will never be more to him than a
pauper's, my dear !  and, I do think, when
Dr. Laughton sees how really honest and
straightforward Walter is, that Dr. Laughton
will think twice."

I'll never take the curb off good
intentions again, without seeing what the
road is before me," Lily says to herself,
remorsefully. Then she looks at Mabel, and
half-laughingly quotes  " A Daniel come to
judgment ! Oh, wise young man ! Oh,
good young judge!"

I'm not a Daniel, neither am I wise or
good, but I know what's what, my dear,"
says Mabel, triumphantly, seeing she has
made an impression, and then Lily gets it
heavily for a few moments presently, in the
way of meek, soul-subduing, friendly castigation,

in a manner that is not to be contemplated
in the ordinary manner of things.

And Lily has to admit that " What's what "
in this delicate minor kej?", is a knowledge
that is withhold from her. So she has
to possess her soul in unwonted patience,
and wait for the outcome of the best resolution
she has ever formed.

Will Walter take it ? Will the man who
has fjiven himself ung-rudsfincfly to the most
irksome and unremunerative side of his professional
labours yield suddenly, and consent
to be well-placed without sufficient labour
on his own part? Will he honourably  but
tamely  take a place he has not won ? Will
he let a woman's hand carve his fortunes for
him while his own is strong ?

These questions can only be answered by
Walter GifFord hiniself. And Walter Gifford
does not have an opportunity of answering
them until he is tongue-tied by considerations
which are forced upon him by other
people.

For example, Dr. Laughton calls on him,
and tells him in suave, courtly phrase, that

he does not desire to see himself succeeded
by an abler man than Walter Gifford. Nor
does the great practitioner, whose fiat has
been fate in this neighbourhood for years,
give his decision with a sordid motive. It
matters little to him whether Walter Gifford
succeeds him or not. He retires !  that is
all ! His retirement is the event, and no one
knows better than himself that his successor
must rely upon himself solely, just as much
as though the " good will " of Dr. Laughton
had never been bought and paid for. But
Dr. Laughton is a mere man, and is afflicted
with a desire to stand well with pretty
women ; and Miss Somerset is the prettiest
and most charming woman Avhom it has ever
been in his power to serve ! If selling his
practice  which he wants to get rid of  Avill
please her ! well, he will sell it, and butter up
young Gifford into the bargain, for young
Gifford has it in him to make a bigger name
than himself. It is in vain that Walter
Gifford asks straightforward questions. Dr.
Laughton evades them with the easy grace
for which he is so justly celebrated, and

without uttering a word that can accurately
be called " untrue," he succeeds in giving
Mr. Gifford the impression that he has been
selected on his own merits to be the successor
of the mighty medicine-man.

From the day you came into the town I
have watched your career with the greatest
interest, and I give my unqualified approval
to the course pursued in every case that
has come under my notice," the courteous
physician says ; and when Walter remarks
that, to the best of his knowledge, not one
of his cases has come under the great man's
notice, he is made to feel that he has raised a
petty quibble, and that there is something
puerile in going thus into details.

You young men are very properly so
entirely absorbed in your own work, that
you have no perception of the cognizance
that is being taken of that work by older,
more experienced, and consequently less
absorbed men," Dr. Laughton explains,
quelling.

Still, I cannot comprehend the motive
which makes you select me, a stranger, when

there inst be so many men equally deserving
as myself, who have worked with you, and
been taught by you," Walter urges.

Put it down to an old man's caprice, if
you refuse to think it a matter of sound
judgment," Dr. Laughton says, for he is
resolved to be loyal to pretty Miss Somerset,
and to keep her secret to the end.

So the honour of succeeding Dr. Laughton
on his own merits is thrust upon Walter
almost against his will, and with reluctance
he consents to the next move, which it is
absolutely essential he should make, namely
to t)'() round under Dr. Lauo-hton's winof, and
be introduced to the more august patients.

He has few friends in Atherton Towers,
none of whom he can take counsel now
Ethel has cast him off, and he does shrink
from taking this final step, which will seal
the bond irrevocably, before he has expressed
his doubts, and perhaps had them
dispelled.

It will be more than useless to consult
Mabel, he feels. That affectionate sister, and
anything but profound woman, will see nos

2

thing out of the wav in the transaction, but
will probably regard it as merely a just and
natural tribute to the extraordinary merits of
her brother ! Still, though he feels that she
will be valueless as a counsellor, he must goto
her for sympathy in this dilemma in which
he finds himself placed. And, by going to
her for Sympathy, he knows that he will get
it from some one else from whom he can
scarcely ask for it direct.

Mabel is alone, rather to his disappointment,
when he goes into the old-fashioned
room at the Uplands, which is
gradually getting the impress of Lily Somerset
upon it. Out of the simplest materials
Lily has brought grace and beauty.

A long, fish hamper seems an unpromising
subject to deal with in the decorative
way, at the first blush, but, treated by
Lily, it seems as if no more fitting receptacle
for ferns and heaths could be found. He
recognises her hand, too, in the way in
which a common, round, deal table has had
its top covered with a cloth of velvety
green moss, upon which wild flowers are

studded artistically. The sight of these
things bring the thought of her so vividly
before him, that he exclaims at once, before
even he gives his sister the customary
salutation 

Where's Lily ? "

Oh ! Walter, she ran up to her room
the moment she saw you coming ;  don't
be angry with her, my dear, she did it
thoughtlessly, but she did it for the best,"
the poor lady blunders out, her mind
so charged with the one subject, that she
does not even notice her brother's look of
supreme bewilderment.

Angry with her !  did it for the best !
what in the world are you talking about,
Mab ? " he asks.

"Don't you know it yet?" she questions
in return.

KnoAv what !  pray don't be enigmatical,
Mab."

Why, know about Dr. Laughton's
practice ? "

I know that he has offered it to me 
what has that to do with Lily ? " Then

he pauses suddenly, as the whole truth
flashes upon him, and though his brow
burns, and his blood gallops through his
veins, there is no anger in his heart
against Lily.

AND ITS CONSEQUENCES !

lpRESENTLY, after a pause, the solemn
 stillness of which frightens Miss
Gifford into the vivid remembrances
of the sacred promise as to secresy, which she
has just well! nearly broken, Walter says:

Let me see Lily ; she can't be silly
enough to think that I can be annoyed
with her ! "

You'll take it, then ? Oh ! Walter, my
dear boy, I am so glad, though I never
thought for a moment that you'd condescend
so far as to take such a handsome
offer, I mean favour, from any
young lady  least of all from Lily Somerset,
because of what has been, you know,
and what you seem to have made up
your mind never shall be again ; and so
I told her when she consulted me  I
mean when she told me what she had

done, and desired me to hold my tongue
about it ; ' No, Lily,' I said, quite firmly, ' hard
as it is to gainsay any of your wishes,
my duty to my brother compels me to tell
you that this can not be ;' and now I
am so delighted to find that I was wrong,
and that you are going to make Lily happy
by letting her make you prosperous."

"My dear Mabel, you always think kindly
on every subject, and wish for everybody's
happiness," he says, gently, and his
sister is nearly melted to tears by this
recognition of her amiability, which, she
instinctively feels, is a little tedious in its
mode of expression at times.

And now, will you let me see Lily ? Ask
her to come and speak to me," he says,
taking advantage of the arrested flow of
sisterly eloquence.

For the first time in her life, Lily Somerset's
heart is beating rapidly from sheer
nervousness. For the first time in her life,
the spoilt child of fortune doubts the wisdom
of one of her own acts, and fears what
the consequences of it may be.

If he would only have accepted the
position without enquiry, and became famous
and rich, I could have borne that he should
never speak to me, or think of me again,"
the girl says to herself, as she stands
clasping her trembling hands, longing, yet
dreading, to be summoned to hear his fiat.

She has to lean against the dressing-table
in order to support herself, when Mabel
comes in, and she can hardly constrain her
trembling to say 

Well, Mabel ! do you bring me the
verdict? Does your brother think me an
impertinent fool, for I see in your face you
have told him."

'' No, my dear Lily, that he does not,
and that I did not ; that is, you can't call it
my telling him, when he jumped at it himself,
in a way that looked like divination ; and
you would have been the last in the world,
I'm sure, to wish me to perjure myself, and
say I knew nothing about it, when all the
time I knew everything; and he wants
to speak to you, and he's so grateful and
touched, that I believe things will end ina

different way to what I feared ; and  why,
Lily! what's this?"

"Only  only  " Lily tries vainly to stutter
out an explanation, through the convulsively-repressed
sobs, and the hot, rushing tears.

I am not like myself," she goes on,
struggling gallantly to regain composure.
I have made myself nervous staying up
here alone, picturing Mr. Gifford's contempt
for my impotent attempt to mould his career ;
and it has given me such a revulsion to
hear that he is going to be friendly and
kind."

Her words sound strangely in her own ears.
Can she be the same spoilt, capricious,
imperious Lily, whose own selfish will and
pleasure have been of paramount importance
to herself all her previous life. Can it be
possible that the mere thought of having
wounded or offended him can be cautioner
this exquisitely painful anxiety? She
feels that her limbs tremble under her, and
that her lips are quivering, as she goes
down the stairs and into the room where
he is waiting to judge and condemn her.

And something in the pleading, pale face,
that is bent so wistfully towards him, makes
him spring to meet her, in a sudden
access of such pitying regard that she maybe
forgiven for mistaking it for love.

Lily, your beautiful generosity, exercised
so delicately, too, as it has been, touches me
more than I can say," he says, warmly taking
her hand ; and she draws her perfectly-balanced
figure up proudly and happily, and
her forget-me-not eyes beam gratitude and
love upon him.

You forgive me for daring to do something
for you, and accept the poor service I
can render, Walter ? " she asked.

He shakes his head, and all her unselfish
hopes and aspirations for him fall down dead.

I am more than strongly tempted to go into
the groove, merely because you wish it and
would put me there," he says, kindly ; " but
look here, Lily, you'd be sorry yourself when
you thought of it coolly, if I deserted the
post I have gained for myself, and the people
to whom I am useful. A man fills the niche
into which he has fitted for himself, better

than he can ever fill one into which he is
pressed. The work I do in my own sphere is
the work that has come in my way to do; it is
ready to my hand ; perhaps  Who can tell 
it might get neglected, or even not done at
all  if I went away from it  "

There is sickness, and suffering, and need
of medical skill in the upper classes as well as
in the middle and lower," she says, briefly,
triumphing in the thought that she is using
an unassailable argument.

There is, Lily, and no man would more
gladly strive to relieve that sickness and
suffering than I would, if it came in my way
in the course of things, and if I hadn't to
neglect my plain and obvious duty in order
to do it ; but to gain, by purchase, a fresh
field of labour, when the one that has been
given to me needs all my care and skill,
would be to leave undone my God given work
for my own worldly gain. Your own good
heart will feel the truth of this, and teach
you to pardon what, at first sight, looks like
a churlish rejection of a sweet, gracious piece
of womanly-kindness."

And I was fool enough to fancy I could
raise a man like you," Lily says, with such
heart-felt admiration for what is best in him,
in her tone, and look, that Walter admits to
himself that his heart would go back to Lily,
if Ethel Heatherle} had never existed for
him ;  " forgive my presumption, and  ask
Dr. Laufjhton to find another successor."

"Do you mean?"  Walter is beginning,,
when she interrupts him hastily 

"Yes, yes, I mean that exactly; let the
arrangement stand, don't hurt me by having
anything returned ; you must know some
clever doctor, and good man, who has a large
family and no practice ; turn my feeble efforts
to good account, Walter ; give me the joy of
feeling that it has resulted in the welfare of
some one better, and nobler, and more deserving
than myself  will you ? "

That I will, right heartily," he cries, and
Lily tells herself, humbly, that she is scarcely
worthy to be associated with this loyal, unselfish
nature, even in good works.

That Miss Gifford's disappointment, when
she comes to hear the real state of the case,

is not bitter, it is impossible to deny. For a
few wild moments she has permitted herself
to nurse the delusive hope that her brother
would acquiescently slide into the position of
local medical potentate, and be the wealthy
and important person she always yearned to
see him become, at the cost of the sacrifice
of some of the loftiest conscientious scruples
entirely ! But still ! " if Walter could doit,
it would be right ! " as she tells herself.
And, now, to hear that all this anticipated
honour and glory, and gold galore, is to be
placed at the disposal of some unknown
person, of unacknowledged worth and poor
fortunes 

It is trying, my dear, very trying," Miss
Gifford says, mournfully, to Lily, and Lily's
face beams brightly, as she answers, cheerfully


"It is right."

A few days after this the Bishop returns to
the Palace and Mrs. Heatherley to the cottage.
The wedding day is fixed for an early
date, and an extraordinary report gains credence
in the neighbourhood, to the effect that

a marriage is arranged between the Marquis
of Monkstown and Miss Heatherley."

"My poor Ethel," Walter Gifford says to
himself, when he hears this, " my Ethel, still, I
know. Whose influence is it? No man but
myself has any over her  it must be her
mother ! "

AT LAMINGTON HALL.

UmINGTON Hall, the seat of Sir
John Hawtrey, Baronet, is one of
the show places of the county. Local
guide books go into ecstacies of enthusiasm
over it ; and after avowing that language cannot
adequately describe its charms, generally
wind up by declaring that it " almost rivals
far-famed Chatsworth."

This, however, may be ascribed to local
partiality, since those who know both places
will fail to discern the faintest resemblance
between them. Nevertheless, Lamington Hall
is a very spacious and a very fine mansion,
well anointed with that golden ointment
which puts all things in the fairest light,
and preserves all things in the most perfect
order.

Its terraces are exquisitely arranged ;
mosaics, formed of flowers and foliage,

master-pieces of carpet-gardening all the
season through. Estheticism finds no congenial
corner at Lamina-ton. Xo thine tall
and ungainly in the way of sun-flowers or
white lilies, or hollyhocks are permitted to
mar the effect of the flat, low growth of
symmetrically-arranged beds. Somewhere,
away at the rear of the house, sheltering
the wing of the palatial stables, there is a
well kept " wilderness," in which nothing
is allowed to run wild, and where every
leaf seems to know and keep its proper
place.

The interior arrangements are quite as
admirably devised, and as effectually carried
out as the outdoor ones. Old Wollaston's
money is put to a good purpose, in so far
as keeping " Heaven's first law "  " Order "
goes. Smoothly and noiselessly works all
the machinery of domestic management,
guided by the firm, strong hand, and the
great, good sense of the mistress of the
house, the baronet's only child, Caroline.

There is no doubt about Miss Hawtrey's
being a very wise dispensation. The great

heiress, who has fifty thousand a year in her
own right by her grandfather's will, is unswerving
in the vigour and the zeal with
which she seeks out lurking extravagancies
and puts them down. There are moments
when the housekeeper and the butler loathe
their master's daughter, for she is not above
chronicling the flow of the very smallest beer.
And even the hens at the home-farm seem to
have an uneasy sense of duty undone on their
parts in the matter of egg-laying, when her
penetrating, cool eyes look them over as she
passes through, on the occasions of her
weekly visit of inspection.

This excellent gift of cautious prudence, in
every case in which money is concerned, is
not an inheritance from her lowborn mother,
the daughter of the Manchester Croesus, but
is handed down to her in unimpaired integrity
by her well-descended, ostentatious, money-loving,
money-grudging father ; who contends
that he has not an atom of penuriousness in
his disposition because he cannot remember
the day on which he denied himself aught
which miofht tend to his own individual

comfort, or to the glorification of himself in
the e3'es of others.

And Caroline resembles him in most respects,
but not in the matter of ostentation.
She has not an atom of love of display in her
nature. She cannot alter the order of things
at Lamington because she is overruled by her
father, who will have it said that his vineries
and conservatories are the finest, and his
carriages and horses the best-appointed in
the county. But it pleases her better to
drive about in a little unpretentious pony-carriage,
than to sit in state in the huge family
coach, or lounge in the elegant landau.

Then again in the matter of dress her tastes
are plain almost to ugliness, her cousin. Lord
Kenmare, thinks, when day after day he sees
her come down to breakfast in a dull-hued,
bodily-made, gray dress, that gives her an
air of quakerish simplicity. She lias not a
girl's natural love for flowers or jewellery,
and never brightens herself up with a deftly-placed
rose, or gathers lace about her throat
gracefully, with a gold brooch. Magnificent
diamonds and other gems repose in her

q2

massive jewel boxes, but Caroline can rarely
be induced to deck herself in any of them.

They suit me no better than a peacock's
tail would a little Jenny Wren," she says,
when her father signifies his desire that she
should array herself sumptuously, and shine
forth in the borrowed light of gems; "beautiful
dress and brilliant jewels ought only to
be worn by beautiful and brilliant women 
they make me look smaller and more insignificant
than I am naturally."

Her humble opinion of her own personal
appearance is quite a genuine thing. In her
early childhood, when she was supposed to
be sleeping, an injudicious nurse remarked to
a nursery visitor that " Miss Caroline was an
ugly little thing sure enough, but that
wouldn't matter !  there would be plenty to
see beauty in her money." The remark sunk
into the childish heart, wounding it deeply at
the time, and leaving an impression that has
never been erased. Her money is the only
elinor that man or woman finds attractive
about lier, she believes. And so she goes on
her way, a self-contained, undemonstrative.

quiet little creature, whose one object in life
is to exercise a wise control over the riches
which have fallen to her share.

As may be imagined, there is little in common
between this quiet, prudent, thoughtful
little lady, and her bright, rather reckless,
Irish cousin. He finds her dull and uninteresting,
especially now that he knows
Ethel Heatherley, and she regards him as
one of the stars above her. But neither byword,
look, or sign will she let him discover
the secret of her heart.

Neither her father, nor her uncle, Lord
Monkstown, have said a word to her of
their wishes about Kenmare and herself.
But she has divined their wishes, and the
reason why Kenmare is made to stay at
Lamington, and the old, sore feeling comes
back to her heart as she sees that not even
the money which the old nurse prophesied
would make her beautiful, can win his
careless eyes to rest upon her for a moment,
approvingly. " He thinks ,me a dull, ]plain
little thing, and he's too honest to pretend
to think anvtliinir else, and I like him for

his honesty," she tells herself. But though
she approves of the honesty, her heart aches
for the cause of its being so displayed, and
she goes on her daily round of duty with
a feelings of bitterness that not all her sense
of justice and reasonableness can enable her
to cast out.

Instinctively she arrives at the truth, when,
after that shooting-luncheon at Bojaie Gate,
Lord Monkstown comes home, and makes
Ethel Heatherley his theme. As the father
expresses his admiration, her eyes are quick
to see the flush on Kenmare's brow, and she
discerns that the son is righteously indignant
at the possibility of having his father for a
rival.

Poor Kenmare ! " she thinks ; " if she only
had half my money, how happy you might
be ; how crossly things go in this world !
Poor Kenmare ! "

Little observant as Kenmare is of her, he
cannot but admit that his cousin does not lay
herself out to attract him, or seek in any way
to forward their fathers' plan. And so, after
a time, feeling that he is safe with her, he

gives her a little more of his time and attention,
and is rewarded by finding out that
the dull, uninteresting, unattractive little girl
whom he has been barely regarding as companionable,
even though he is argues in her
father's house, is well informed on many subjects
that have an interest for him, and can
talk about them sensibly.

One morning he stops her just as she is
about to step into her little pony-carriage,
and drive herself down to the home-farm to
receive the weekly amount of the dairy and
poultry-yard produce. The pleasure she feels
in the fact of his coming to her thus voluntarily,
hinds no expression in either face or
manner. Unconsciously she fears that any
exhibition of liking on her part may check his
friendly feeling, and drive him from her, and
she is beginning to dearly love the intercourse
with him, prosaic and void of sentiment as
it is.

"Where are you going?" he asks, coming
up to her swiftly, " I want you for a few
minutes, to tell you something that has
disgusted me awfully ! "'

Can you wait till I come back from the
farm ? " she asks, indifFerently, though her
heart leaps with pleasure when he says 

Why can't I go to the farm with you ?
Yes ! let me come, and send your groom
away ; I can open the gates and hold the
pony while you're pottering about down
there."

You can come if you please ; and I shall
not want you, William," she says, placidly,
but if Kenmare had eyes for her, he would
see a colour on her face and a light in her
eyes that only the painter. Love, can put
into a woman's face.

You heard my father speak of those
people who have been staying at Boyne
Place?"

' Do you mean the Bishop and his daughter,
or the widow who is going to marry the
Bishop and her daughter?" she asks.

I mean the widow, Mrs. Heatherley and
Ethel  that's her daughter's name. Ethel
Heatherley is the only girl I've ever cared
for, and I love her more than a fellow . ever
loved a fjirl before, I believe, and I've told

her so, and she wouldn't have anything to
say to me, because she was engaged to a
man  a doctor at AUerton Towers. And,
now, this morning, my father shows me a
letter from her mother ' accepting the offer
of his lordship's hand for her daughter ! '
Carry, it's monstrous, when I love her so ;
my own father, too ! it's horrible."

"Did Lord Monkstown know of your 
your love for her ? "

I never told him it was Ethel ; but once,
when the question of my marrying somebody
else arose, I told him that I cared too much
for a girl already ever to think of marrying
another one ; but it's not that. Carry. I'm
not unreasonable enough to blame my father ;
he has a right to ask her to be his wife,
knowing nothing of my affair ; but how can
she have brought herself to accept him ? "

How, indeed ! " Caroline murmurs ; then
half-fearing that she may have partially betrayed
herself by those two words, lie goes
on, collectedly 

I understand it is her mother who has accepted
him for her daughter ; from the little

I have heard of Mrs. Heatherley I should
think she is a scheming, ambitious woman,
just the one to accept my uncle's offer, without
her daughter's knowledge, and then work
on the girl to redeem her mother's promise ;
don't condemn Miss Heatherley, till you know
more about it, Kenmare."

He looks at her more wistfully, and with
more interest than he has ever shown in her
before, and says :

'Pon my word, you're a kind little thing,
Carry ! I felt I must speak to someone about
it. When my father spoke to me just now,
and showed me Mrs. Heatherley 's letter, I felt
stunned, and it was all I could do to keep
myself from bursting out with the truth ; but
I reminded myself that it would be a frightful
thing, if this great calamity does come to
pass, for him to know that I had wanted her
myself; so I pulled myself together, and got
away as quickly as I could."

I am very, very sorry," she says, earnestly.


'' That's very good of you," he responds,
heartily ; " someway or other, I didn't expect

Zo

much sympathy from you. I thought you'd
regard anything of the nature of love as bosh
and nonsense, and only thmk me a fool for
being unable to get over my disappointment."

"Oh, no! I can quite understand a man
loving a beautiful girl, like Miss Heatherley ;
beauty is a great gift! the most precious
possession a woman can have, I think, for
it wins the only thing worth winning in life 
real love."

The girl speaks with an intensity and
fervour that astonishes her companion, and
covers herself with confusion, as soon as she
ceases speaking.

I shouldn't have thought you felt like
that," he says, Wonderingly. " You give me
the idea of being so very full of commonsense,
that I fancied you had never given a thought
to the trivial matter of love in your life."

"perhaps I haven't for myself; but I have
thought a great deal about it for other
people."

But you're wrong about the beauty, you
know; it isn't only beauty fellows care .for;
there is something else, and every bonum,

who's anything at all, has that something else,
I believe, for some fellow, if he only happens
to meet her."

She shakes her head solemnly.

Not every woman ; I haven't it," she says,
and she is innocent of all wish to extract a
compliment from him.

*you don't know that," he says, encouragingly,
but there is no strong air of
conviction about his manner of saying dt.

You don't know that ! it's only that you
haven't met the man with the right, clear
sight to see it: I daresay you have had any
number of professed worshippers after you,
now haven't you ? Girls with such fortunes
as yours always have."

She winces ; and the same look of mortified
pain which swept over her little face when
she heard her nurse's words long ago, sweeps
over it now. But she forces herself to say
quite calmly :

Yes, my money has had many worshippers
; there are many men who Mould cumber
themselves even with me, for the sake of my
fortune."

It is a difficult speech to answer. The
speaker's humble opinion of her own personnel
is so evidently unfeigned, that he, half-sharing
it as he does, does not think it worth
his while to deprecate or combat it. Accordingly,
he diverges abruptly from the subject
of her lack of charms, and returns to the
one that is absorbing all his thoughts.

"Though 1 can't have her myself, I
should never have been utterly wretched
if Ethel had stood to her guns, and married
her doctor ; but if this thing is true I shall
go away, and I shan't very much care where
I go, or Avhat becomes of me ; to think of
her as my father's wife ! To think of her
selling herself in such a way will be
maddening ! "

Hope still that it is merely her mother's
consent which has been given ; I don't
believe the girl lives who could take your
father after refusing you ; it would be impossible,
unnatural ! "

She speaks so fervently that he cannot
doubt any longer that she will prove a real
true friend to him. A friend to whom he

may with safety and assurance turn in an'
time of trouble or distress. A good, sensible
girl, who will give him a sister's quiet love,
listen patiently to the story of any difficulties
which may assail him, and, if needful,
give him advice and sympathy ! All this
her tone seems to promise him, and it never
occurs to him, that such a sensible, plain girl
as she is, can be actuated by any warmer
feeling than this " friendship," on which he
is so confidently relying.

It does me good to hear you speak m
that way, Caroline," he says, cheerily. His
sanguine spirit has revived under the influence
of her sympathetic words, and he almost
fancies that her instinct against the possibility
of Ethel committing the enormity of marrying
his father, must be a correct one, " I wish
I could get you to know Ethel ! You'd plead
my cause for me like a little brick, I know,"
he says, enthusiastically.

"No one can do that for you. This is the
dairy ; shall we stop here or drive up to the
house ? "

"Up to the house I think ; anything to

prolong the pleasure of driving with you,
Carry," he says, so up to the house they
go, and Mrs. Hocking, the farmer's wife,
stabs Caroline right through the heart, by
whispering, meaningly 

Pleased to see the gentleman, and more
than pleased, Miss Hawtrey! I've heard two
or three words, but didn't like to take any
notice, till I saw you driving up together,
so cosy and happy, just now ; I repose it
won't be long before we lose you now, Miss ? "

These words are half-whispered, but still
they are designed for the gentleman's ears as
Avell ; and feeling sure that he hears everyone
of them, Caroline is too proud to attempt
to arrest the torrent of j\[rs. Hocking's eloquence.


"This gentleman, is only my cousin. Lord
Kenmare, Mrs. Hocking ; you are quite mistaken
in supposing that he will ever be
anything else to me," she says, with cold
dignity, and Kenmare thinks " she really
needn't be quite so serious about such an
utterly absurd mistake."

The rest of the visit to the farm is very

pleasant  to Kenmare. Now that he has
broken the ice, and discoursed of his love to
Caroline, his spirits have risen considerably,
and he is quite happy and at ease. It amuses
him to see her gravely going through the
business of auditing the accounts which are
submitted to her, and it interests him to see
her eight perfectly-matched Jersey cows, and
her various runs of rare poultry.

Cut out for an old maid," he says to himself,
as he marks the orderly way in which
she has everything kept, and the thorough
precision with which she contrives to have all
her directions carried out. " Cut out for an
old maid ! but a dear, sensible little piece of
ice for a friend for all that ; how she would
laugh at the governor's suggestion, that I
should make up to her. Awful joke it would
be to tell her."

chapter, contented with
that mahogany and horse-hair set, hideous as
it is ; the things seem to have grown by
magic since you came, Mrs. Templeton."

I have found my vocation," that lady
says, triumphantly.

And one of it's greatest charms to me
is that you have effected this transformation
in the dining-room without expense," Lady
Monkstown says, approvingly; "it's just rearrangement,
nothing else  the art of putting
old things in a favourable light ; how well
that tapestry looks against that end wall ;
I am quite impatient to see the change

you will effect in the drawing-room and
boudoir."

I shall wreck them first," Mrs. Templeton
says, and have them repainted and
papered "

I think that quite an unnecessary expense,"
Lady Monkstown interrupts.

My dear Fanny, it is absolutely essential ;
would you put those fine old marqueterie
cabinets and escritoires against a white
watered shiny paper with a border of
cabbage roses: you cripple me at the outset
by objecting to the re-painting and papering
; I shall send up to Morris, describing the
most prominent furniture, and he will send
a paper in true artistic keeping ; I shall
have those odious carpets taken up, and put
Persian rugs in their place ; you will hardly
know your own house in a week."

I shall not afford Persian rugs ! " Fanny
says, definitely ; upon which Mrs. Templeton
sweetly and serenely declares that " as she
cannot work in chains, she must cancel the
agreement."

N 2

So terminates her first engagement rather
abruptly ; and it is altogether unfortunate
that it should be so, for Lady Monkstown, in
disgust at the unseemly state in which her
house is left, and, in a state of hopelessness
about bringing order out of chaos, and beauty
out of ugliness, speaks of it as " Mrs. Templeton's
failure'' and altogether neglects to say
anything about her own repression of the
new papers and the Persian rugs.

I shall try new pastures," Mrs. Templeton
writes to Ethel ; " a prophet is rarely one
in his own country ; I am going to London
to make a few bold strokes and carve my
own road to fortune. My advertisement is
rather attractive, ' Mrs. Templeton, Artistic
Adviser.' Lady St. Just has refuted my offer
of superintending the furbishing up of her
London house in the most resolute manner :
My house is quite dingy enough already,'
she writes ; ' I don't want it made to look
more mediaeval and miserable than it does
already.' So rude and crude of her, isn't it ?
Monkstown is so different ; he writes to ask,

6 If I will do him the great honour and service
of re-organising every house he possesses,'
and adds, ' I shall treat you as great physicians
who cure other evils are treated : as
their fees range from fifty to a hundred
pounds, so shall I do myself the pleasure
of giving you the same on every occasion of
consulting you ! ' Isn't he liberal and charming
? And don't you sometimes regret  No !
I will not tempt you to admit that you do,
but I will ask you to allow that he is deserving
of more than he has got, shall I
say."

So for a time poor Mrs. Templeton sails
upon a prosperous sea, for just so long a
time, in fact, as Lord Monkstown's magnanimity
allows her to ring incessant changes
in the arrangement and furniture of his town
and country houses. But when she has torn
down and built up, and frittered away a
good deal of time and money, and finally
pronounced her task complete, fresh clients
do not spring up, and the poor Artistic
Adviser's occupation is gone.

But she is in funds for the time, and she is
endowed with a sanguine spirit. That she
does not seem likely to prosper in the profession
which she has enterprising invented
does not depress her for more than a day
or two. Like Cleopatra, " age cannot wither
nor custom tame " this wonderfully young-hearted
woman.

Again a letter comes to Mrs. Walter Gifford
fraught with hopefulness from Mrs. Templeton.
She has resuscitated the memory
of an early dream of art and ambition,
she says, and this dream is that she shall
go on the stage !

To her credit be it said that difficulties
do not deter her from struggling to carry out
her aim, since she has resolutely refused
her children's earnest counsel against her
pursuing the histrionic course. She puts
herself under the tuition of an able, accomplished,
and assiduous instructor, who?
strangely enough, grand actor as he is in
tragedy himself, is an even finer teacher and
critic of female comedy parts.

And if Mr. Copley Fielder is an able
master, it must be admitted that his ability
has never been exercised upon an apter, or
more capable pupil than Mrs. Templeton. It
is in vain that those who are in the secret of
what she is striving for, deride and denounce
as futile the efforts she is making to secure
success. It is in vain that they proclaim her
age ; averring that the first imperative condition
for a first appearance upon the stage is
youth. It is equally in vain that they deny
her still sylph-like figure, and say she has no
stage presence ! Mrs. Templeton takes no
heed at all of sneer or innuendo, but just goes
on her laborious path perseveringly and undauntedly,
until the best judges declare that
if those command success who deserve, then
is Mrs. Templeton destined to fill a prominently
placed niche in the Temple of Fame.

Ethel, down at Atherton Towers, reading
judiciously worded preliminary notices of her
mother's forthcoming appearance as "Constance
in the Love Chase," is full of sorrowful
fear and sickening foreboding. Her

mother's letters are full of buoyant, happy
anticipation, but Ethel's heart sinks lower and
lower as she reads the self-confident epistles.

Mother's voice is so low and light, it
won't half fill even a small house," she says,
deploringly, to Walter ; and he, having made
up his practical, exact, and impartial mind
that Mrs. Templeton is going to make a
colossal failure, and then return in penitence
into the wholesome obscurity of a home
under his roof, replies,

It won't make a particle of difference to
the result whether she is heard or not ; when
a new actress appears on the boards people
go to see a young girl, who may reasonably
be expected, whatever her beauty and talent
in the present, to develop a far greater
amount of both in the future. If they don't
find what they go to see they're disappointed
and disgusted, and I fear that's what they
will be with your mother."

Mother's a very pretty, graceful woman,
and her manner is the most fascinating I
ever saw," Ethel says, with filial loyalty.

She is all you say  in your eyes, darling,
and 1 like you for believing in her chances
of success ; but all the same the public will
look at her from a less favourable point of
view, and I would have you brace yourself
to read some cruel and pungent criticism."


With what appears " reckless daring," to
the croaking band who foresee nothing but
ignominious defeat for Mrs. Templeton,
that lady, it is decided by her manager
and instructor, shall make her debut at
Manchester !

The defiant daring of this decision creates
a furore before the event that means either
a brilliant success or a blighting failure. For
Manchester is known to be a terrible test
of both the nerves and talents of even well-seasoned,
time-tried, and hardened actors
and actresses. Its audiences are highly
cultured in dramatic knowledge, and are
keenly critical. How, then, may a middle-aged
woman, who has never put her foot
on any stage, dare to hope to pass unscathed

through the awful ordeal of an expectant
Manchester house !

But Mrs. Templeton does dare to hope that
she may do this, and her manager-tutor does
not throw anything like a wet blanket over
the fire of her ambition.

CHAPTER XI.

A STAR OF STRENGTH.

fHpSANGUAGE can't tell how I feel for
ygflg Walter and you, my dear," Miss
Gifford says to Ethel, whenever
any fresh paragraph appears in any one of
the newspapers about Mrs. Templeton. It
is really almost miraculous the way in which
Miss GifFord, who has never been known
to look at a paper before this epoch, hunts
down the lightest line of reference in the
press to Mrs. Templeton.

She goes straight to every allusion to the
forthcoming actress, however deeply it maybe
buried in " Theatrical Notes," or " London
Letters," with an unerring instinct that distances
many an experienced reader. And
she dwells upon these allusions, serving them
afresh, word for word, with an unfavourable

emphasis that is all her own to everyone
whom she may meet in these days.

I see the Daily Telegraph says that your
mother's ' ambition is laudable, if nothing
else ; ' now, one can but feel that what they
mean by that is, that though ' laudable, it's
misplaced ; ' that's what I've feared myself all
along."

Then, Mabel, you must remember that
you are not a fair judge ; you know less than
I do, even, of the requirements of a dramatic
career, and I know absolutely nothing."

No ! You are right in saying I know
nothing about the stage. I have always
made a point of standing aloof from its
snares and abominations."

When Mabel says this, Ethel quotes a
verse from one of the Bab Ballads, relative
to the experiences of the Rev. Micah Soles,
who, acting on the advice of his Bishop,
passes a few hours in that " penitential fane
called Drury Lane."

But Miss Gilford fails to see any point in
the quotation, and by way of answering it

falls back on her former statement of having
sedulously preserved herself from all the
snares and allurements of the drama in any
form.

I tremble to think of what's before them
all. Mrs. Templeton's flightiness was a proverb,
I'm told, in Atherton Towers, even when
she was in private life ; what it will be now,
when she gets among ballet-girls and pantaloons,
it is impossible to say."

It is recorded with sorrow that the above
uncharitable remarks are made by Miss Gifford
in a loud under-tone to a friend whom
she meets one morning in Turner's shop.
Mental agony is vividly depicted on the
friend's face as she listens, for she is aware
of the propinquity of Lady St. Just, who is
showing herself in good colours now, as a
staunch adherent of Mrs. Templeton's, and a
warm com mender of that lady's determination
to struggle for freedom and independence.

To Miss Gilford's amazement, and Miss
Gilford's friend's dismay, her ladyship begins
a free fight at once with the words :

Mrs. Templeton's ' mightiness,' as you call
it, never hurt a human being, and that's
more than can be said of anyone's censorious
tongue. And now she's going to make a
name for herself, that all whom you pity for
belonging to her, Miss Gifford, may welland
reasonably envy ; the little woman has
real grit in her," Lady St. Just adds, turning
to one of her own ilk who happens to be in
the shop at the time ; " she'll never be a Lady
Macbeth, but she'll be a bewitching Miss
Hardcastle, and a bewildering neighbour
Constance."

I never heard of either of these ladies,"
Miss Gifford says, lamely, for Lady St. Just
fixes Mabel with a stony stare from which
there is no escape. " I never heard of either
of these ladies, but I do think there's something
infra dig. in my brother's wife's mother
playing at being them."

Lady St. Just laughs gruffly, but heartily.

Never you mind," she says, " don't disturb
yourself about Mrs. Templeton's social status,
for depend upon it she will never take you into

consideration when she is compassing it ; she
is a very clever and sprightly little lady, and
if she does all I expect her to do I shall regard
her as the chief attraction to my ' at homes
next season, if I am fortunate enough to get
her."

These words permeate Turner's, and exercise
a wholesome restraint on the imaginations of
many who have been thinking that Mrs.
Templeton is on the high road to perdition.
But on the whole, " Turner's " takes the safe
and Philistine view of Mrs. Templeton's
exploit, in spite of its aristocratic advocate and
defender ; and their name is legion who prophecy
dark things concerning the woman who
is going forth on a treacherous smiling sea to
help herself !

As for Ethel, she has Manchester on the
brain in these days of suspense. She rakes
up every immaterial and valueless fact concerning
it and its inhabitants that comes
within her reach. And when she has done
this, she finds she is as far as ever from the
knowledge of how " they will receive mother."

On the day before the initial performance
is to come off, a request breaks from Ethel's
lips straight away from her heart.

Let me go to Manchester, Walter ? If
she fails she will want me; if she gets through
she will want me still more ; let me go ? "

You are not strong ! the least excitement
may be prejudicial to "

"No, it won't  it won't! let me go. Excitement
won't hurt me or anyone else ; let me
go.

I will let you go, certainly, but I think
you are rash."

The way in which you say that cancels
the permission you gave a moment before.
No ! I will not go as if I were going to gaze
on a pernicious and forbidden spectacle. I
will go to applaud and rejoice with my
mother if she succeeds, and to comfort
and soothe her if she fails. I don't much care
which she does  if the doing either will not
-hurt her. Walter, may I go ? "

Yes."

"Freely and clearly, without your harbouring

a thought in your mind to the effect that
I had better have stayed at home ? "

Freely and clearly."

And whatever comes you will promise
that you will never use those awful phrases,
'I told you so,' or 6 I feared as much,' to me?"

Never. I distinctly promise this ; but
Ethel, my darling, prepare yourself for hearing
them used by other people ; your mother
has gone out of her way with a feeler to
challenge social criticism  and it will be
given harshly, I fear."

"If she comes off the boards baffled and
beaten I will be there to welcome her as if
she was a History or a Rachel ; no one can
humiliate or contemn mother really. She
is trying to use her talent instead of hiding
it away in a napkin. Walter, like you, I
may wish that she had put it out to interest
in some other way, but I won't say the way
that she has been drawn into selecting is
worse than some safer ones."

I thing you had better pack up if you
mean to catch the train that will land you

VOL. III. o

in London in decent time to-night," Walter
interrupts, good-humouredly ; and then he
adds, " and I shall go with you, my plucky
love. Whether your mother is victrix or
vanquished tomorrow night, she shall find
her son as well as her daughter waiting to
welcome her."

Mr. Gifford can't help feeling rather magnanimous
as he says this. His mind's eye
already sees a picture of Mrs. Templeton
abased and discomfited ; and though he is
sorry for what he believes to be the inevitable
bitter end, he has made up his mind to see
her through it gallantly, and to throw the
mantle of his son-in-lawship and general
respectability around her without hesitation.

And in resolving to do this he is really resolving
to do a doughty deed, for he knows well that
more than half of his lady-patients in the
country will flout at the idea of the lady who
was the foremost of them all " having gone
on the stage." They will flout at her, and
will signify that they pityingly sympathise
with him for being connected with her. And



at the same time if she succeeds, they will
boast next season in town of having " known
her intimately in Atherton Towers," and will
diplomatise to get her to their houses.

Meantime, she is soaring on untried wines
through a rarified atmosphere of expectation.


Her youthful aspect and unforced vivacity
amazes herself, even, when she turns from
the hands of her dresser to give a last look at
herself in the glass. " I might be twenty ! I
am Constance ! " she says, admiringly, for she
has in appearance surpassed all her most
sanguine expectations of herself. Every line
of her supple figure is as true as it was on
the day  long ago  when she married Mr.
Heatherley, and was pronounced to be the
slimmest, gracefulness young lady that ever
stepped up to altar rails ? " Her feet and
hands are as small and nervous as ever. Her
hair is of as bright a golden tint as is ever
seen without the aid of " auri comus." Her
eyes are like sapphires  sparkling, effective !
Her complexion is  whatever she wills it to be !

and that is saying a great deal for a skin that
has borne the wind and weather of forty-five
summers and winters. Lastly, her taste in
dress is unassailable.

There is a great hush in the house when
she comes upon the stage with that air of
being where she is for her own pleasure that
makes the stalls begin to think about the
actress's " motive," and causes the gallery to
halt before it hoots. Then in the midst of
the hush her voice falls on the ear of the
assembled crowd, and with a sob of relief
one of the crowd falls back in her seat
whispering to her neighbour :

Walter ! her voice has won the fame
already ! See ! how they're leaning and
listening ! "

It is a fact ! Mrs. Templeton's sweet,
silvery voice, has, under training, become a
bell which rings sympathetically, not only
into every well-trained ear, but into every restrained,
but, maybe, good heart in the house.

The applause is unanimous, overwhelming,
conclusive ! Mrs. Templeton has made such

a " first appearance " in Manchester as will
make every London manager, worthy of
the name, seek to secure her at any
price.

And, after ail, what has she done ? Some
of the critics find flaws in her manner, her
intonation, her " poses," and her conception
of the part. Others find her " wanting in
repose," " in animation," " in lightness," " in
solidity," " in composure," and in that
nervousness which proclaims self-confidence."
But the public  for whom manager's
cater, and critics carp  find her wanting
in nothing ; avow her to be absolute
perfection.

So it comes about that Mrs. Templeton
leaves the Manchester theatre this night a
recognised Queen of Comedy.

As she leaves it to step into her carriage,
Mr. and Mrs. Walter GhTord arrest her progress,
Ethel half swooning  apparently from
delight.

Mother ! I am so proud of you' she
gasps. " Oh, mother ! I would have liked

every one in the theatre to-night to know
that I am your child."

Take her home, take her home ! Walter,
how could you let her come here? My Ethel,
keep up a bit ; I'm with you  your mother,
you know," the new theatrical star cries,
utterly regardless now of a dramatic effect.

And so, between Walter and Mrs. Templeton,
Ethel is taken to an hotel, and lodged
there as comfortably as nature will permit
for the night, considering that during it a
little daughter is born to Walter and Ethel
Gifford.

That this little child should be weak and
ailing is no unnatural result of the overstrained
state in which Ethel has been living of late ;
but it is a ghastly blow to Walter Gifford
that it should be so. He has unconsciously
taken pride in his own robust health, and
in Ethel's perfect physique  and now, their
offspring is " weak and ailing."

A dark demon down at the bottom of his
heart whispers : " This is the doing of Ethel's
mother ; this is the doing of the woman who,

on the night her daughter went through
woman's most awful agony, played the part
of a girlish coquette before a house full of
strangers."

The demon has a horribly shrill voice.
He is a little devil with a long name, and it
is to be feared we all know him well. His
rio'ht designation is " Desire-to-cast-blame-
off-myself-and-lay-it-on-other-people." Walter
lusts him from out his heart and off his
shoulder with difficulty. He is a little devil
who sticks. 

If I could only have persuaded Ethel to
remain at home quietly, or if Mrs. Templeton
could have been induced to defer her
triumph for a few nights, my poor wife
might have been spared much agony," he
finds himself thinking ; and he adds, rather
bitterly : " Of course, the woman's insatiable
vanity will be pampered now, and will grow
on what it feeds. She has made a hit, there's
no doubt about that ; and in the flush of
her triumph she'll go off, and stoop to any
depths to conquer, as Miss Hardcastle, while

her own daughter lies here suffering and in
danger. My poor Ethel shan't be left here
alone, though ; I'll send for Mabel ; she's
always to be relied upon ; vanity and frivolity
will never tempt her from her duty."

Meanwhile, Mrs. Templeton is being overwhelmed
with the most tangible and satisfactory
compliments that can be paid to success
with offers, namely, of splendid paying
engagements from the managers of several of
the first London theatres. Oddly enough,
she seems in no hurry to accept them ; and
she is accused by those who desire to secure
her, and to know definitely what she will do,
of giving herself airs, and of being capricious,
as it is the wont of popular favourites
to be.

Mabel comes, and Ethel continues very ill
for many weeks ; but it is not Mabel who
watches day and night with unremitting
devotion by the sick-bed. It is not Mabel
who soothes the fractious baby, and nurses
it with double-distilled motherly care and
love. It is the new theatrical star who does

this ; it is the frivolous, vain, careless, and
indifferent Mrs. Templeton, to whom, under
God's providence, Walter Gifford owes his
wife's restoration to health.

xlnd when she is restored to health, and
ready to go back to her own beautiful home
in Atherton Towers, it is the woman whose
insatiable vanity Mr. GifFord has been thinking
must be thirsting for fresh triumphs, who
says to Ethel,

There is something; incongruous in the
idea of a grandmother being; on the stage.
Moreover, I can't make up my mind to part
with baby ; so, if you and Walter will have
me, my dear, my professional career shall end
from to-day, and Til go back and show
Atherton Towers that my artistic education
has at least taught me how to grow old
gracefully."
