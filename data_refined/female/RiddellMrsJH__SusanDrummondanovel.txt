CHAPTEE I.

AN OFF DAY IN THE PARK.

Own in the country the meadows
gP were yellow with buttercups, the
hawthorns were in full blossom ; in the
Hertfordshire woods, sweet-scented white
and purple violets literally carpeted the
turf; beside the meandering streams of
Surrey wild flowers were spreading and
blooming ; but still the spring had been
late and ungenial, the accustomed easterly
winds had held a longer carnival than usual,
vegetation, on the whole, was backward ; and
as a natural consequence, Hyde Park, which
seems specially sensitive to the influence of

Vol i. 2

weather, could not, in the May of 1874, be
considered looking its very best, as is sometimes
the case in that "merrier" month sacred
to catarrh, rheumatism, and bronchitis.

The winter of 1873-74 was what is
generally called " singularly mild." It was
singularly disagreeable, at all events : snow
and frost held aloof, and bitter blasts and
raw unwholesome mists and damps prevailed
instead. That season will in one district of
London be ever held memorable for a most
dense and awful three days' fog, during
which period a darkness like unto that of
Egypt spread its pall over the whole of the
East end.

On New Years' night 1874, indeed, it
seemed as though the English climate had
determined to turn over a fresh and satisfactory
leaf. Such a fine evening was surely
never known before on any 1st of January;
so magnificent a moon rarely, even in August,
has shone on fields where the grain was ripe

for the reaper's sickle ; but, like too many
good resolutions made that day, the promise
of amendment led to no lasting improvement,
and winter dragged itself into
the lap of spring; and the spring itself was
late and dreary ; and in the May of that year
Hyde Park was not looking its best.

Hyde Park is a place which appears to
greatest advantage when seen in full dress,
when the trees are full of leaf and the flowers
in full bloom, and the Drive full of carriages
and the Eow full of riders, and the whole
scene one of incessant motion, and constant
change, and shimmering colour, and varying
effects.

At some periods and under certain conditions
it looks more mournful than a desolate
heath or a wide expanse of lonely moorland.
There is a sky under which its aspect
is depressing in the extreme. Even in the
season " there are times when the very

genius of desolation seems to be brooding

22

over the grass, and the trees, and the mud-coloured
Eow, and the Drive whence the last
carriage has departed.

It is then, plodding his lonely way homeward,
the whole show over, with the sun
setting behind him, and night coming on
apace, the pedestrian who is not rich or
fashionable or prosperous feels a fine despair
oppressing him, and is inclined, as a
comforting exercise, to recite aloud six verses
taken from the ninth chapter of Ecclesiastes.

Judging from the face of a lady who was
walking her horse along the Eow, she had
compassed this state of mind little more
than an hour after noon on that specially
dull May day in the prosperous year of grace
eighteen hundred and seventy-four, when
my story opens. Tittlebat Titmouse himself
could not have looked more dissatisfied.
Her expression was gloomy as the aspect of
the heavens, which seemed to betoken rain ;
and her listless dejected attitude accentuated

the desolation of the Park, which was almost
empty.

A Drawing-room had drawn nearly all
the rank and fashion in town off to St.
James's ; and the few who at an earlier
period of the day graced the Eow were
now gone home for luncheon, leaving but
one solitary rose to bloom, almost unseen,
in a desert peopled apparently only by nurse-maids,
children of tender years, and Life-guardsmen.


And this was not a rose that liked to
blush unseen. Solitudes were not places
she would have affected of her own freewill.
She preferred to be amongst her kind,
more especially when that kind included a
considerable number of male admirers. A
quiet life would certainly not have been
her choice, and yet for the twenty years
she had lived in this world a quiet life
chanced to be her portion.

She was a very singular-looking girl to

be riding in the Park, apparently a total
stranger. She seemed unknown, even by
sight, to those who, had, earlier in the day
passed and repassed her, and who now were
gone away. Not a woman had spoken a
word to her, not a man raised his hat.
She had walked and cantered her horse
round and round the Eow, evincing a curious
tendency to " hug " the railings, instead of
venturing out ii;to the middle of the ride.
A gray-haired groom attended upon her,
keeping closer to his mistress than is the
usual habit of grooms ; and the discontent
which clouded her face assumed on his the
proportions of absolute ill-humour.

Yet, if beauty count for anything, she
was a lady most grooms would have felt
proud to follow!

As has been said, the Park was singularly
empty. There were not any equipages
worth noticing ; the few equestrians had
gone away, either because they feared rain

or were hungry; the usual loungers were
elsewhere ; but still the young lady rode
up and down, and round and round, with
the dull steady persistence of a person on
the treadmill.

That she was not enjoying herself in the
least might have been patent almost to a
superficial observer ; the groom, who was
enjoying himself even less, knew wherefore,
and wondered why she did not end the
ordeal and go home.

Ko fairer face was seen in the row that
season. One man, leaning upon the railings,
decided no fairer face ever could have been
seen anywhere. It was quite new to him.
He had not beheld it before, and, while he
stood watching her as she passed, he marvelled
more and more who she could be,
what she was, and whence she came. He
was a man of thirty, with closely-cut light-brown
hair, and rather starved moustache.
He had the look of a man about town ;

and, while evidently captivated by the girl's
appearance, he eyed her with a critical investigating
glance, which spoke more for
the coolness of his head than the warmth
of his heart.

He seemed to have no appointment to
keep, or anything particular to do, for he
waited on and on, watching lady and groom
with a puzzled expression that certainly did
not betray the full extent of the admiration
he felt.

To him, over the grass, there came, with
a quiet but not stealthy step, a man much
his senior, who, saying, " Well, Sudlow, as
usual, admiring rank and beauty," took up
a position beside the person he so addressed.

"I do not know much about the rank,"
answered Mr. Sudlow, " but the beauty is
undeniable ; " and he fastened a bolder gaze
than he had previously ventured upon the
girl, who was passing at the moment.

She saw this and coloured, and yet there

was a look in her eyes  a downcast, indefinable
look  which told she did not feel
wholly offended.

The new-comer followed her progress
thoughtfully.

She can't ride a bit," he remarked.

Mr. Sudlow made no answer, but he
turned his head and stared hard and inquiringly
at the speaker, who, though no
question had been asked, replied, "I should
say not," and then they both remained silent
till after she passed again, which she did
this time at the side of the Eow furthest
from where they stood.

"She is very beautiful," said Mr. Sudlow.

"No doubt, to those who admire that
sort of thing."

What sort of thing ? " asked the younger
man.

If you can't see for yourself, it would
be useless to try to explain," answered his
friend, in a tone which had something annoying

in its very calmness ; " but the girl
is good-looking  beautiful if you like."

I wonder who she is ? Did you never
see her before ? "

The other shook his head.

Never ; and it would not grieve me if
I never saw her again. What have we
here ? " he added, as two persons, riding
very fast indeed, came at a hard trot
down the road leading across the Serpentine.
" You'll get yourselves into trouble,
my friends, if you don't mind what you are
about," he added.

But apparently the pair knew very well
what they were about, for, reining in their
horses, they walked as quietly down the
Eow as if they had been riding lambs
instead of powerful hunters, that looked
ridiculously out of place in Hyde Park, and
carrying such light weights.

There was a lovely flavour of the country
about the new-comers. One, a lady, was

mounted on the heavier of the animals  a
roan with black legs, a grand chest and
splendid action, well up to fifteen stone.

For a moment Mr. Sudlow's acquaintance
wondered why she rode the roan instead
of the magnificent bay, upon which he fastened
an appreciative gaze, but his wonder
was not of long continuance. Just as the
horses were passing the spot where they
stood, the bay took umbrage at the sight
of a stone roller which lay at the side of
the Eow. If it had been a wild beast he
could not have made more fuss about the
matter ; he shied almost across to the opposite
. railings ; he got up on his hind legs,
and reared as if he meant to fall right over
on his back ; then he put down his forelegs
and kicked, till Mr. Sudlow felt sure
his rider's last hour was come; after that he
tried to get his head and bolt ; and when
he was balked of this intention he seemed
for a minute to lift all his four feet off .the

ground at once, and dance upon nothing
in the air.

Meanwhile the gentleman sat the horse
as if he had been part of him, and his
companion looked on without evincing the
slightest discomposure or anxiety.

By Jove ! " said the elder of the spectators
under his breath, with an admiration
which was as involuntary as it was genuine.

People shouldn't bring such brutes into
the Park," observed Mr. Sudlow, who had
turned quite white, and who would, indeed,
have speedily placed himself beyond all risk
of danger had not his dread of ridicule
been greater even than his cowardice.

Then the centaur patted his horse on the
neck as if he had done something praiseworthy,
and the bay and the roan proceeded
peacefully on their way side by side.

At the same moment, the girl who had
been for so long a time exercising herself
on the Hyde Park treadmill, and who was

just then retracing her way from Albert
Gate, shrank past the pair, putting all the
width of the ride between them.

No words could adequately describe the
agony of terror into which the scene had
thrown her. She had been coming on to
meet the new-comers when the horse shied,
and during his varied performances she sat
with her eyes fastened on the rider, frightened
almost to death, afraid to turn back,
afraid the creature would rush madly upon
her, afraid her own steed might next take
alarm, suffering a thousand agonies in the
space of about a minute, and for once in
her life utterly unmindful of who might be
looking at her, or how she looked. She
had never even cast a glance at the roan,
all her attention being concentrated on the
bay, which she regarded in the light of a
four-footed demon ; nor, indeed, did the
lady on the roan particularly regard her :
but as they passed the groom a sudden

light seemed to dawn upon her mind, and
she looked back.

Why, that must be Lavender ! " she
exclaimed; "and, yes  certainly  that is
Margaret Chelston ; " and without more ado
she wheeled her horse round, and, riding
after the girl, said as she got close up to
her, 'who would have thought of our
meeting here, Margaret ? "

That settles the matter," remarked Mr.
Sudlow's companion to that gentleman ; and
Mr. Sudlow somewhat shakily answered,
Yes." Evidently there had been a doubt
of some sort in the minds of both men
which was now laid at rest.

I wonder who she can be, Gayre ? " said
Mr. Sudlow. " Are you sure jou have
never seen her before?"

Quite sure ; and yet, oddly enough, her
face seems familiar to me. Oh, look ! this
is very funny."

It was rather funny. The girl on the

hunter had put up a warning hand to keep
lier companion at a discreet distance, and
then, placing the object of Mr. Sudlow's
admiration in safety between herself and
the railings, proceeded with her conversation,
whilst the man who was thus debarred
from the delights of feminine society philosophically
fell back on Lavender, to the
manifest discomfort of a groom who " knew
his place" and "had been accustomed to
what was fitting,"

"It is long since I beheld so lovely a
woman," observed Mr. Sudlow.

"I never did," answered Mr. Garret

is a pity you so seldom speak
seriously."

I fail to see the particular application
of your remark."

"Why, it is not ten minutes since you
said she might be very well for those who
liked that sort of thing ; now you declare
she is lovely."

"0, I was talking of the other one.'

"Pooh!" exclaimed Mr. Sudlow.

"There is no accounting for tastes,"
remarked Mr. Gayre.

So it seems," was the curt reply.

You need not be angry with me because
I have not fallen in love with your
beauty," said the elder man. " She is a
very nice thing in girls, indeed. I should
say she is not long from the country; but
she will soon know her way about town.
I daresay, Sudlow, you may meet her at
some party or other before you are much
older."

"Do you really think it likely?"

"I do, indeed. I should not mind buying
that horse," he added, following the
bay with the eyes of a person who understood
horse-flesh.

What a curious seat the fellow has ! "
observed Mr. Sudlow, trying to emulate his
friend's critical manner.

"Do you know the reason?" asked Mr.
Gayre, cruelly throwing him at once.
"No; do you?" retorted Mr. Sudlow.
Of course ; he has been accustomed to
ride buck-jumpers."

"And what the deuce are buck-jumpers?"
It is a pity your grandfather is not
alive to tell you," observed Mr. Gayre;
which was an extremely unkind cut, had
Mr. Sudlow clearly understood the full
meaning of his friend's remark.

"What are you going to do with yourself
this evening ?" asked Mr. Gayre after
a pause, which Mr. Sudlow had devoted to
the consideration of that conundrum concerning
his grandfather.

I do not know  nothing."
"Come and dine with me, then."
The fashion of Mr. Sudlow's face instantly
underwent a change. It lighted up
with pleasure and surprise, and he answered
heartily,

Vol. i. 3

"I shall only be too glad. How very
kind you are to me ! I can't imagine why
you should be so kind."

Neither can I," was the answer. " You
do not amuse and you do not instruct me.
I have no daughter I want you to marry,
and I have enough money of my own without
trying to rob you of any of yours.
Farewell, then, till eight. If in the meantime
you discover why I am civil to you,
tell me."

Left thus to follow his own devices, Mr.
Sudlow, after a moment's hesitation, turned
and walked after the lady who had attracted
his admiration.

"I knew it," said Mr. Gayre, glancing
back ; and then, with a cynical smile curling
his lip, he pursued his way, which
happened to be Citjward. He was accounted
a great man in the City ; he was
a great man anywhere, indeed, if money
and greatness can be considered synonymous

terms. If a stranger had asked
any one of the many persons who touched
hats to him, and waved hands at him, and
made point of stopping to says " How d'ye
do ? how are you ? "was if their own
existence depended upon hearing that the
state of his health was satisfactory  who
he was, the answer would have been,

That, sir, is mr. Gayre, the banker 
Gayre, Delone, Eyles, and Gayre, Lombard
Street."

Utterly ignorant of the wealth and
wisdom they had passed by unheeded, the
two young ladies rode slowly on, talking
as they went.

"Who in the world, Susan, is that
person you are with ? "

It was Miss Chelston who asked this

question the moment the '* person " thus

spoken of was relegated to the improving

society of Mr. Lavender.

He is my cousin," answered Susan.

32

"0, indeed! which of them?"

"Mrs. Arbery's son. He has just come
back from Australia."

Did he bring his steed with him ? "

"No," said Susan, laughing; "that pretty-creature
and this," stroking the roan as she
spoke, " belong to a neighbour, who lets
us exercise them."

Does he wish them exercised in the
Eow ? " asked Miss Chelston ; " because if
he does, I will never venture into it again."

No, it is too far for us," was the
reply ; " but we should not do any harm
to any one if we did come. Are you as
timid about riding as you used to be ? "

The beauty shrugged her shoulders.

"I hate it," she answered.

Why do you ride, then ? " was the
natural question.

"Why do we do a hundred and fifty
things every day of our lives we would
rather not do ? " she retorted. " Susan,

pray keep your horse a little further off.
He has not a nice expression of face at
all. He looks as if he would bite. I can't
think what could induce you to mount
such a monster."

"He is tall," agreed the other indifferently;
"but a hand or two does not much
signify."

"And where have you been living since
your uncle's death ? " said Miss Chelston,
giving two young men who met them at
the moment a full view of her face turned
towards her companion, and her eyes raised
with a bewitching expression of interest and
sympathy. " You dear old thing, it was
hard for you to have to leave the Hall."

It was not so hard for me to have
to leave the Hall as for you to have to
leave the Pleasaunce, Maggie," answered
the other, with straightforward frankness
and good sense. "I knew the day must
come when it would be necessary for me

to go; but you 0, I felt so sorry for
you!"

"Yes; but, after all, I don't think things
are much worse with us than ever . they
were. Indeed, I think on the whole they
are better. As for you, it is simply
dreadful to be brought up . as you were
and then left without a sixpence. I call
it disgraceful of your uncle."

Don't say anything against uncle, please,
to me," said Susan, involuntarily tightening
her rein, and so causing the roan to spring
forward, which movement elicited a little
scream from Miss Chelston ; " and I am
not left without sixpence' she added. "I
have two thousand pounds saved from the
wreck of my father's fortune. If uncle
had known sooner that great India house
was going to fail, he would have arranged
to leave me something ; but as it was "

I know," interrupted Miss Chelston ; "he
always: intended you to marry his son."

"Who came home with a wife and two
children," added Susan. " Dear uncle 
dear, kind uncle I "

"That is all very well," said bliss
Chelston ; " but he might have left you
some practical proof of his kindness. Even
my father, who, as you know, is not
remarkable for the interest he takes in the
troubles of any one excepting himself, says
it is a shame for you to be left out in the
cold  a very, very shame ; " and Miss
Chelston nodded her pretty head to italicise
the naughty words she would not utter in
their native force and integrity.

How is your father P " asked Susan ;
then, without waiting for a reply, she
added, " the first ride I ever had in my
life was on his old horse. Wild Indian. Do
you remember Wild Indians It was
my fourth birthday, and he took me all
across the park and up the long beech
avenue."

And he has told me often enough since
you were not frightened, and that you
ought to have been his daughter instead
of me. I wish with all my heart you had
been."

They did not speak for a minute ; each
apparently was busy with her own thoughts ;
then Susan, looking at her old friend, said
suddenly, and as if the fact had only just
struck her,

"You are prettier than ever, Maggie."

"Do you think so?" answered Miss
Chelston.

"Yes, I always thought you were the
most beautiful creature in the world ; but
you are more beautiful now than you
used to be. It is London, I suppose, and
dress."

"Dress improves every one," said the
young lady, as a sort of general statement
which she immediately applied to a particular
case by asking.

"What could induce you to come out
in that hat and habit?"

"What is the matter with them?"
asked the other.

"Matter! Why, they must be ten years
old!"

I daresay they are, or more ; they are
not mine. I tore my own habit to rags
almost in Ireland."

Have you been staying in Ireland ? "

"Yes, with the Dudley. By the way,
I wrote to you from their place, but I
suppose you never got my letter. The
girls hunted, and of course I went with
them."

"Of course you did. Does Mrs. Arbery
hunt ? "

Good gracious, no ! Why, she must
be nearly sixty."

I didn't know. I only thought that
might be her habit. Seriously, Susan, you
must buy yourself something fit to wear."

"It is not .worth while. . I shall not
have the chance of riding even borrowed
horses long."

Dear me ! what will you do ? "

"Do without." 

"And you so fond of galloping about
the country." ;

"A niaii may be very fond of champagne,
and still find himself able to exist without
it. Will Arbery says where he is, out in
the Bush they drink nothing but tea."

"Will Arbery is this latest cousin, I
suppose ; any tenderness there ? "
"Not the slightest. He has come home
for a wife, I may tell you, and that intended
wife's name is not Susan Drummond."

"Most unfortunate Susan! whose cousins
won't marry her, and who, for all her
knowledge of horseman  or rather, horsemanship
 has not, I see, yet learnt to
hold her reins properly."

"Yes, is not it stupid of me? I have

tried to break myself of that old trick ;
lout, do you know, I do not feel as if I
had the slightest power over my horse
when I take them the other way. . Where
are you living now, Maggie?"

We have only a friend's house for a
short time," was the reply. " When we are
settled you must come and spend a long
day."

'M shall be delighted," answered Miss
Drummond. " You knov Mrs. Arbery's
address, don't you ? "

Yes ; Enfield, is it not P "

"Enfield Highways" corrected the other.

' Good heavens ! have you ridden all
that distance to-day P "

It is not so very far," laughed Miss
Drummond.

"And don't you want to get back before
night ? "

There are many hours before night,"
answered Susan. " Still we ought to be

making our way home. Just let me
introduce Will to you. Sultan is perfectly
quiet, I assure you."

sewell, I don't know; however, if I am
killed my death will He at your door.
Your cousin won't come very near me,
wil he?"

The introduction was effected without
any mishap, Sultan comporting himself
during the ceremony as if he had never
stood on his hind legs or lifted his hind
heels in his life. Then adieux were exchanged,
and Miss Drummond and her
cousin, having announced their intention
of returning home vit Camden-road, turned
their horses' heads towards Stanhope Gate,
and were soon out of sight.

With a sigh of relief Miss Chelston
pursued her way to the Marble Arch,
thinking pensively as she rode slowly along
that it was a pity Susan Drummond had
not the slightest idea of making herself fit

to appear in decent society, and wishing
she felt as Httle afraid of horses as that
young lady.

Who do you think the girl is we saw
in the Park to-day?" Mr. Sudlow asked
Mr. Gayre the same evening, as they sat
tete-astute over their wine.

Which of them ? " returned the
banker.

"0, the one with the dark hair, and
the dark-blue eyes, and the long lashes,
and the damask-rose complexion."

Yes, go on ; who is she ? "

Miss Chelston, the only daughter of
Sir Geoffrey Chelston, of the Pleasaunce,
near Chelston."

Of Sir Geoffrey Chelston ! " repeated
Mr. Gayre, setting down his claret. "God
bless me ! "

Why, do you know him ? "

"I used to know him," was the unexpected
reply. " He married my sister''

SIR GEOFFREY Shelton.

IHEEE have been, since the institution

of that order, all sorts of baronets 
even good. To the latter class, however, Miss
Chelston's father certainly did not belong.
He said himself he " was a good deal better
than some, and not nearly so bad as
most ; " but, then, no one who was fortunate
enough to be acquainted with Sir
Geoffrey attached much weight to any of
his statements. Had this estimate of
himseK been true  which it was not  the
moral condition of the rest of the world
must have been, indeed, regarded as
lamentable in the extreme ; for Sir Geoffrey
had, since his boyhood, been in the habit

of doing those things which he ought not
to have done : whilst those ' things which
he outfit to have done he did not.

Geoffrey is not a name which suggests a
taste for the Turf, a fondness for the society
of jockeys, blackness, and gamblers ;
an almost inconceivable amount of ignorance,
except on the subject of "sport," horses,
games of chance and skill  an abundance
of that disreputable lore which a man who
has always been knocking about the world's
least desirable haunts cannot fail to accumulate
; to say nothing concerning a distaste,
which almost amounted to hatred, for the
pursuits, trammels, and traditions of a decent
and orderly life.

There was no shame about the man, and
there was no hope whatever of repentance
unless it might be a poor makeshift deathbed
repentance, with a wasted life stretching
behind, and an unknown eternity yawning
in front. So long as a " chance remained

for him"  a chance, that is, of returning
to the mud in which he loved to wallow 
remorse was not likely to fasten its tooth
upon him. His doings, his sayings, his sins,
his shortcomings, were enough, in very truth,
to have caused the scholarly ancestor from
whom he inherited his name to rise from
the grave, sold by this degenerate descendant
to strangers, and return to see the
ruin wrought by one man  one solitary
man.

There had been spendthrifts aforetime
amongst the Chelstons, but no spendthrift
like unto this. There had been sinners 
wicked, godless, graceless sinners ; but either
they died young, or, taking thought to
their ways betimes, reformed and settled
down ere age came upon them. There had
been misers who grudged themselves food
and the poor a farthing ; but it was left
for Sir Geoffrey to spend freely on his own
pleasures, and rob both rich and poor of

that which of right belonged to them. His
inherited title  won by a certain Ralph
Chelston on a battle-field, where the fate of
the day was changed by a mere handful
of gallant soldiers  he dragged like a worthless
garment through the mire of the
kennels ; while his name, one of the oldest
in the kingdom, had become a mock and a
byword amongst the vilest of women and
the worst of men.

He was not born to poverty like many
another, who, with equally little satisfaction
to himself or any other human being, has
travelled the road to ruin. It was not
necessity which first made him acquainted
with strange bedfellows. No impulsive generosity,
no desire to serve a friend, no*
boyish prodigality in the way of giving
great entertainments, or wild desire to
scatter gifts around, brought him into early
contact with the Jews. If he had desired
a father's help and counsel, he could, till

Vol. i. 4

he was nearly twenty-six, have obtained
both from a parent wise as loving. So far
as man could tell there was not an excuse
for the bad mad race on which he entered.
Some said he " cast back " to a certain
Elizabeth Godwin, who was raised by a
former baronet from the condition of a
fisherman's daughter to the rank of Lady
Chelston ; but those best learned in the
family lore shook their heads when they
heard this theory ; for Elizabeth, possessing
for her dower as much sense as beauty,
had proved the saviour both of her husband
and his fortunes. When she married
him he was, with other gay gallants of his
time, running a muck ; but she took her
husband well in hand, and brought him out
of the ordeal safe, though not unscathed.
She wore her honours with a splendid meekness,
winning respect rather than compelling
it. She had, as one, who knew her well,
chronicled, a " smile for the rich and a

tear for the poor ;" in all ways an exceptional
woman, who once, it was recorded,
saved a child's life at the peril of her own.
Except as regards mere brute courage, Sir
Geoffrey did not own a trait in common
with his brave and beautiful ancestress, but
he had one good quality  physically he was
no coward.

People marvelled a man of such ancient
lineage should play the pranks he did.

Why, don't you know," said a farmer
once in the village tap-room, " ' the older
the seed, the worse the crop.' "

Sir Geoffrey was an awful crop for any
house to have to gather home within its
records. With him the race seemed destined
to die out. Slightly varying the
words of James V. of Scotland, it might
have been said of the wealth of the Chel-
stone that it had " come with a lassie" and
that the name "would go with a lassie."
The king who conferred the baronetage on

42

Ealph the soldier added the hand of an
heiress, who was nothing loth to wed the
handsome hero. Since that time heiresses
had come and gone, adding their fortunes
to the Chelston coffers ; but now the coffers
were all empty, and Sir Geoffrey owned
no lands, or houses, or money, or son, or
anything save one fair daughter and a
pile of debts that never could be paid.

Well might men wonder where the
money had gone. There was nothing
whatever to show for it. Sir Ealph had
bought the estate, adding to his own
small patrimony many a broad acre and
goodly manor ; Sir Charles built the great
rambling house, and laid out the quaint
gardens, and planned the terraces from
the west front to the river Ciel ; Sir
Bruce built the stables and kennels, and
then, when he tired of dogs and horses,
purchased the pictures and statues which
made the Pleasaunce a show place. Then

there was the Sir Ealph who entertained
royalty; and Sir Geoffrey, who spent his
life in collecting blackwater and rare editions,
and who wrote a book full of
useless learning, of which he printed but
one hundred copies ; and then came the
saintly Sir Francis, who, after a youth of
sin, devoted his old age and his money
to ecclesiastical purposes, rearing and endowing
one of the loveliest churches in
the whole of England ; then there was
another Sir Charles, who performed great
deeds at sea, and died an admiral ; and
a Sir James, who was a great politician,
and rose to be a foremost man in the
councils of the nation ; and then there
came Sir Cecil, with the scholarly tastes
of his progenitor, Sir Geoffrey, which he
entirely failed to bequeath to the son he
named after that "lover of the best
thoughts of older minds."

Never, surely, was there such a man

for getting fortunes and wasting them as
Sir Geoffrey the second. Before lie was
seven-and-twenty he came into possession
of the Pleasaunce, a large sum in ready
money, pictures, plate, horses, carriages,
everything necessary to the establishment
of a gentleman of rank and position.
When he was thirty his mother, who
had been an heiress, died, and he got
her money. Two years later he married
Miss Gayre, dowered with a fortune of
thirty thousand pounds, which was so
settled, the lawyers declared, that a coach-and-four
could not be driven through it.
When matters came to be investigated,
however, it was found that if a coach-and-four
had not scattered her fortune.
Sir Geoffrey had burrowed a way into
the money. Four years afterwards his
grandmother left him a satisfactory sum
in ready cash, and this legacy was soon
after followed by one from his only uncle.

But all these legacies were mere drops in
the ocean ; Sir Geoffrey went through them
at a hand-gallop ; and when he finally sank
in a very rough sea of well-nigh unlimited
liability, there was not a thing left to show
for the money that had sifted through his
hands but piles on piles of writs, and
lawyers' letters in sufficient quantity to
have papered the walls of the new " thieves '
kitchen " hard upon Temple Bar.

Everything saleable was sold ; everything
go able was gone  books, pictures, statues,
horses, lands, furniture, stock, timber. If
he had been able to dispose of his title,
that would have followed in wake of his
other possessions. In less than thirty years
from the time of his father's death he had
not a rood of his own ground left, not
even the family burying-place ; not a roof
to cover his head belonging to himself ;
not a chair to sit down on, or a table
to dine at ; not even old Chelston Pleasaunce

 with its moss-covered avenue, and
its rusty gates, and its park, kept latterly
like a meadow, and its garden, where the
roses were trailing across the paths  to go
down to, when London life grew for him
very hot indeed.

To say that in any one respect, whether
personally or mentally, Sir Geoffrey even
faintly resembled a gentleman, would be to
libel a class not accustomed to flattering
similes.

Of course when people heard he was a
baronet, and had run through hundreds of
thousands of pounds, they declared there
was " something about him," that " blood
would tell," and all the rest of it; but
meeting him casually " knocking about," it
never occurred to any human being to
suspect he was other than some disreputable
horsey individual who frequented racecourses
and stables, who affected very tight trousers,
who was a proficient in bad language, who

wore his white hat a good deal on one side,
who walked with his legs wider apart than
is the custom of those who have not spent
best part of their waking hours on horseback,
and to whom no respectable landlady
in her senses would have let her first floor,
even if furnished with the best references
and offered a month's payment in advance.

It had happened to Sir Geoffrey in his
comparatively palmy days to be taken for
what he looked like ; and as he never afterwards
hesitated to tell the story himself,
there can be no harm in repeating it here.

One day wanting something in a hurry,
he called at the shop of a saddler with
whom he had never before had any dealings,
was shown what he required, and marvellous
to relate, laid down a sovereign in payment.


The price of the article was one pound
precisely, but the shopkeeper handed him
back two shillings.

'what's this for?" he asked.

0, we always allow ten per cent, to
grooms' was the answer.

Do you ? " said Sir Geoffrey, coolly
pocketing the two shillings. " I think I'll
patronise you again."

Which, indeed, he did to some purpose ;
for when the final settlement of his bad
debts came about, it so happened he
owed that particular tradesman something
like four hundred pounds.

It is delightful to think of the charming
manner in which favoured persons can incur
debts they know they will never be able to
discharge, and how easy it is for any man
with a handle to his name to cozen the
British tradesman.

You and I, my friend, with the limited
income, might wait a long time for a loaf
of bread unless the Bet. were well assured
the wherewithal to pay for it would be duly
and truly forthcoming. But a baronet, ora

knight, though he may not have a lucky
penny to bless himself with, need not, even
at this present incredulous period of the
world's history, want any manner of earthly
thing that is good.

As regards Sir Geoffrey Chelston, he was
one of those men out of whom no created
being seems able to make money. He had
no steward or lawyer or agent, or mistress
or boon companion, who waxed fat while
he grew lean. He was not systematically
robbed or persistently cheated. His tenants
were harassed, his solicitors worried, his
friends victimised, his servants' wages left
unpaid, and, as has been said, at the end
of it all there was nothing to show for the
princely estate mortgaged, for the fortunes
gone, for the pictures and the books and
the jewelry and the timber, any more than
might have been the case had the whole
been swallowed up bodily on one disastrous
night in the Goodwin Sands.

Nay more, misled by the Baronet's easy
indifference, by his gross ignorance of
matters with which most men are conversant,
by his " devil-may-care " manner, by a certain
fatalist warp of mind which had descended
to him not from the fair Elizabeth, and by
the impossibility of conceiving that it was
absolutely necessary such wide estates and
such an old title should "go down into the
pit," many hopeful persons had tried whether
"something could not be done."

Joyfully Sir Geoffrey surrendered the helm
to each in succession : the credulity of any
fresh fool concerning the future, meant ready
money to him in the present. That it also
meant loss to the fool did not affect the
Baronet in the least.

They speculated for a rise," he was wont
to say laughingly, " and the stock fell  that
was all."

The stock did fall indeed ; there is no
quotation known on 'Change that could

adequately represent the fall in the Clielston
stock as it appeared eventually to those who
had felt quite sure they would be able to
make a crowd thiner out of it.

If I had not to write this book about
quite other people than Sir Geoffrey Chelston
and his dupes, or rather the dupes of their
own imagination and self-confidence, who,
setting out to shear, came home shorn, an
instructive history might be compiled for the
benefit of solicitors, bankers, money-lenders,
and others, who were each and all represented
on the bankruptcy schedule when the
Baronet went airily into Portugal Street with
a rose in his buttonhole and a straw in his
mouth to pass his examination. Liabilities
scarcely to be recorded in figures : assets
available for the benefit of the unsecured
creditors  nil.

Take one pleasing instance as an illustration
 but a poor illustration, it must be
confessed, because it is sketched from a

landscape over which the evening shadows
were drawing rapidly down.

A smart young lawyer, who thought all
the wisdom of his predecessors folly, bought
a practice in the market-town of Chelston,
near the Pleasaunce. There he heard a
great deal about Sir Geoffrey, his debts, his
recklessness, his rent-roll, his mortgaged
acres, his embarrassments, his one daughter,
till he got nearly beside himself with the
magnitude and originality of the design he
had conceived.

He possessed a few thousands ; he believed
he could reckon on a few thousands more
from his relations. He knew a man who
was enormously rich and the father of an
extremely plain daughter ; the " oracle "
might be worked, he considered ; so without
more to-do he set 'himself to work it.

Sir Geoffrey was not difficult of approach
bless you, not he ! The young lawyer did
not experience much trouble in boarding

the good old ship Chelston, in enticing the
Baronet into his pretty Httle parlour, in
introducing that worthy to his 'blue-eyed
wife, in walking down the street to the
Golden Stag, where Sir Geoffrey put up ;
the talk between them being all the while
as " pleasant and familiar as talk could
be."

After a short acquaintance, he began
dexterously to feel his way.

"Your affairs have been mismanaged, Sir
Geoffrey, I am afraid," he suggested.

"They have, damnably," agreed Sir Geoffrey,
with agreeable frankness ; but he did
not say by whom.

It seems to me that all they require is
a Httle systematic arrangement," observed
the adventurous young man.

"That's all they ever wanted," answered
Sir Geoffrey with another oath.

"If a person were to devote time and
energy to the matter, they could soon be

put in train," observed the lawyer tentatively.


"They might," replied the Baronet; but
it is only justice to add his tone was
dubious.

There was nothing more said then. They
went, of course, into the Golden Stag,
where Sir Geoffrey asked his new friend
what he "would take;" and the wine
which the landlord produced having been
duly added to an already long score, the
nominal owner of Chelston Pleasaunce goton
his horse, and rode back to that place,
leaving the lawyer well satisfied with the
progress he had made.

Not a fortnight elapsed before he was
installed as Sir Geoffrey's legal adviser, of
whom that gentleman had already about
a hundred. He was told just as much as
the Baronet chose to tell him ; he paid
out a couple of small but very pressing
executions ; he wrote to several persons



who had issued writs ; and he began to
find his affable cent in " pocket money."

That was Sir Geoffrey's lively way of
putting the obligation, and you may be
sure the young lawyer laughed loud and
long at the pleasantry.

The Baronet wanted so much pocket-money,
however  or, as he put the matter,
he had such a confoundedly big hole in
his pocket "  that ere long his accommodating
friend thought it might be better
to expedite affairs a little ; so one day
he went across to the Pleasaunce, where
he found Sir Geoffrey seated in the library,
the portrait of his scholarly ancestor surveying,
from its frame above the mantelpiece,
long lines of well-nigh empty bookshelves
; a small dog lying on the table,
and a large one stretched on the hearth-rug
; brandy and soda-water on a tray
beside him ; and a number of unopened
letters littering the blotting pad.

Vol. i 5

All duns," said the Baronet, sweeping
them carelessly on one side. "Well, and
what has blown you over? Some good
wind, I am sure : for I was just wondering
where I should get enough money to
carry me to town."

The lawyer took a seat, and commenced,
with diplomatic caution, to unfold his plan.

"You'd like to be rid of all this annoyance,
Sir Geoffrey?"

It was thus he opened his first parallel.

Indeed, I should well like to be rid
of it," answered the Baronet ; " and if anyway

out of the mess has occurred

to you, I shall be only too glad to discuss
it when I return from London."

He had gone through too many interviews
of the same sort not to have learnt
his best wisdom lay in deferring the final
hour of explanation. Explanation, bitter
experience had taught him, meant a sudden
stop in the supplies.

When do you suppose you will be
back ? " asked the lawyer.

0, in a few days ; a week at farthest,"
said Sir Geoffrey ; " and I want to start
this afternoon, if I can anyhow raise
funds."

"I have not much money with me,"
observed the lawyer.

I can take your house on my way
to the station," suggested his client.

Before I leave I should like just to
ask you one question," ventured the other.

Ask away," said the Baronet, graciously.

Should you have any objection to resettle
the estate ? "

Sir Geoffrey stared at him.

How the deuce could I do that," he
asked, " when it's as good as out of my
hands altogether ? "

'' But if it were back in your hands ? "

"That's quite another matter. I'd do

anything in reason, I'm sure, to get out

52

Universal m win

of this blank blanked continual hot water.
I can't see, however, where the good of
resettling would be now. As you know,
or as, perhaps, you don't know, there is
not a male left to come into the title
after me ; and there was no remainder to
females in the patent."

The Baronet took great credit to himself
in that he never, in his later years,
told his legal advisers a syllable he could
not swear to. He did not count silence
any falsehood. So long as they asked no
questions he held is tongue; when they
put a thing to him plainly, time had
proved it was better to answer without
equivocation. Then if they liked to go on
deceiving themselves  which they generally
did like  it was their own fault, not
his.

For which reason he told this latest
adviser a fact " any fool," to quote Sir
Geoffrey, " could find out for himself from

the Need Book in a minute." There was
no heir to the title.

I am aware of that ; 0, I am quite
aware of that'' answered the other.

All I want is everything to be fair
and above board," said the Baronet, with
a genial frankness. " I don't know how
you mean to help me ; but I take it for
granted you have some project maturing
in your head, and all I can assure you
is, you won't find me stop the way if you
are able to find an outlet. Only don't
ask me to listen to any details now ; for
it is of vital importance that I should get
into town by the afternoon express."

Sir Geofirey was detained so long in
town by reason of what he called a
stroke of luck," that his new friend
deemed it prudent to follow and "put
matters in train."

He found the Baronet, who had won
something considerable on the Turf, in the

highest spirits. His talk was of a certain
outsider who had come in first; and it
proved somewhat difficult to get him to
listen to all the other had to say.

Divested of verbiage, the lawyer's proposition
was this :

He knew a gentleman who had made
his money in trade  " never mind what
trade," he said, hesitatingly.

"That does not matter in the least,"
observed Sir Geofirey, in a truly liberal
spirit.

If there were one thing this man adored
beyond all other things, it was rank. He
would, in a way of speaking," declared the
lawyer, " part with all he possessed for a
title."

"Well, that's odd too," commented the
Baronet. " I'd sell my title and "  but I need
not particularise the other adjunct Sir Geoffrey
offered to throw in as a mere make weight 
"for a few thousands, cash down."

He has a daughter," went on the lawyer.
She is not handsome, certainly. I suppose,
however, you would not allow that to influence
you much."

I always did prefer a pretty woman to a
plain one ; but what has she to do with all
this ? Her good or bad looks can't signify tome."


I thought you would take a sensible view
of the matter," observed the other. " Stow, I
believe  indeed, I know  a marriage might
be arranged which would at once relieve you
from your more pressing embarrassments, and
induce my millionaire  "

Stop a minute," said the Baronet. " Do
you mean a marriage with me''

I could not mean one with anybody else,"
was the reply. "You see no objection, I hope?"

"There is only one objection; but I am
afraid it is insurmountable, unless you are
able to find a way out of the difficulty. We
can't get rid of Lady Chelston."

"What Lady Chelston?"

My wife."

But you have not got a wife."

"Haven't I?"

She died fourteen years ago."

"Did she?"

"You  you haven't married again, Sir
Geoffrey, have you ? "

No, faith ! One wife at a time is enough
for any man."

But you were left a widower fourteen
years ago, when you came back from abroad
with your little girl, dressed in deep mourning
; and you said then, ' Poor Maggie has
lost her mamma.' "

So she had. When we were on the Continent
my wife and I parted for ever. My
daughter and I were in mourning, I remember
; but it wasn't for Lady Chelston."

And do you mean to tell me Lady Shelton
is still alive ? "

And likely to live, so far as I know."

"And has there never been anything to
enable you to get a divorce ? "

My good fellow, do not ask such ridiculous
questions."

"And you are tied hand and foot matrimonially
as well as pecuniarily ? "

"Your statement of the position is painfully
accurate."

And how am I to get back the money I
have advanced you?"

If you advanced it in the expectation of
being repaid on my marriage with your friend,
who is, as you say, not handsome, I really
have not an idea."

But I can't lose my money because you
happen to have a wife living when everybody
thought she was dead."

If you like to take your chance of hanging,
you can get rid of her."

Then the lawyer broke out. Sir Geoffrey
himself could scarcely have indulged in worse
language, in more futile and frantic profanity.

He would expose the Baronet. England
should ring with an account of the transaction.
He had been swindled ; he had been
robbed ; he had been dealt with most treacherously
; his pocket had been picked by a
person who called himself a gentleman, but
who was in reality no better than a common
thief and swindler.

"He goes on in this way because I won't
commit bigamy," said Sir Geoffrey, addressing
the imaginary jury the lawyer had summoned
to sit in judgment on so heinous a criminal.

"But surely in common honesty you will
pay me ? " said this irate creditor.

Pay you ! how in the world am I to do
that?"

Why, you have won a lot of money, you
say."

"0, but I want that for myself; besides,
there is very little left. You talk about being
deluded and disappointed. You have not
been half so grossly deluded as I have been.

What is your disappointment compared to
mine? I made sure you had hatched some
scheme for cheating the Jews and giving me
my own again, and now the whole thing
resolves itself into an impossible marriage.
Gad, if I had been free I'd have got a rich
wife for myself long ago ! You may be
very sure I never should have employed a
lawyer to look one out for me."

Perhaps this matter hastened the end a
Httle ; but, under any circumstances,' that end
could not have been long deferred. There was
a rush down to the Pleasaunce, a race as to
which creditor should get his man into possession
first ; but they all got there too late. Sir
Geoffrey had " taken the wind out of their
sails " by begging a Jew to whom he owed a
large sum of money to petition the court, and
the court sent down a messenger, who was
comfortably installed at the Pleasaunce when
the representatives of the two chosen tribes of
Israel, and various so-called Christians, who

may have been, and very probably were, descended
from the other ten sons of Jacob, put
in an appearance there, only to be immediately
turned out again.

There was wailing and gnashing of teeth
amongst bailiffs and sheriff's officers, and lawyers
and creditors ; but the Baronet remained
nobly serene.

"It was bound to come," he explained to
the friends who offered him their condolences.
"I don't really know that I can be much
worse off than I was ;" and seeing the resigned,
not to say cheerful, manner in which Sir
Geoffrey bore his misfortunes, people came to
the conclusion there was something in the
background, that he had prepared a featherbed
to fall on, satisfied of which good management
on the part of the Baronet, society refrained
from giving him as cold a shoulder as
it might have done had that amiable abstraction
believed he was an honest man.

I shall have to take a house in London,"

he remarked, not because at the mordent he
had the slightest intention of doing anything
of the sort, but merely for the reason that he
thought the statement sounded well ; " a furnished
house, till I can pull myself together a
little."

Then spake young Aloreby, who had
been causing the large fortune left by his
papa, a great colliery proprietor, deceased, to
disappear like dust before the wind, till his
mother, the widow Moreby, who, though sometimes
doubtful in her English, had a thorough
knowledge of business, came to town, and,
assuming the conduct of affairs, as she had a
right to do, being not merely executrix, but
part-owner of all the coal-pits whereout old
Moreby had extracted his money, announced
her intention of taking him abroad away
from " all his vicious companions ;" spake
this youth, who had not been blest with Sir
Geoffrey's friendship for more than a few
months, and said.

My crib in the Eegent's Park would be the
very thing for you, Chelston ;" and then there
ensued a little chaff and various allusions to
Mrs. Moreby and another very different sort
of lady who had exercised the mind of the
worthy widow in no slight degree, which need
not be more particularly chronicled here ;
and Sir Geoffrey made himself very agreeable
while these themes were in progress, and
any one might have imagined the last thing
he had in his thoughts was of the house in
question, or of taking in young Moreby.

But somehow he just stepped into the
"crib" as it stood  fully furnished  and,
when he was fairly in residence, said quite
calmly to his youthful friend,

"I do not know how to thank you sufficiently
for lending me your house. It
shall be taken good care of, 1 promise
you."

Now young Moreby had never dreamt
of lending Sir Geoffrey anything without



being paid for it ; but he found the
Baronet's understanding so dense on the
subject, he was forced to yield the point
with such grace as was possible under
the circumstances.

% J,"

GAYRE, DELONE, Eyes, AND GAYRE.

she Spirit of Improvement, taking a
K walk about the middle of the year
1857 down Lombard Street one day, bethought
itself that the banking-house leased by
Gayre and Co. from the gentleman whose
fleshly tenement was temporarily occupied
by the meddlesome sprite referred to, ought
to be rebuilt.

Nothing less to the taste of the old
firm could readily have been suggested.
Ancient ways seemed good in their sight ;
spick and span new edifices savoured, according
to their ideas, of shoddy com
panics, limited liability, tricks of trade,

bankruptcy, and various other matters hateful
to honest men.

More, to rebuild would cost much money,
and Gayre and Co. did not like parting
with even a Httle money, unless, like
bread on the waters, it was sure to come
back to them after many days with interest
from date added. Rebuilding would
inconvenience them, and that was even a
more serious consideration than the pecuniary
outlay ; rebuilding was unprofitably
laying down gold at some ridiculous rate
per foot on the property of another man ;
and the fuss and bustle, the hoarding, the
scaffolding, the masons and labourers, the
mess and lime and confusion, and utter
demoralisation of the integrity of their dear
old dirty den, would prove annoying, not
to say intolerable, to their clients, who
were mostly slow-going people of title and
old-fashioned City merchants, whose fathers

and grandfathers had trusted their money
Vol. i. e

to Gayres' keeping, and never found cause
to repent of the confidence reposed.

If a bank, and all a bank's customers,
dislike change, cleanliness, and convenience,
it is evident that without great external
pressure things are likely to remain in
their original condition till the crack of
doom ; but when this pressure did come
in the shape of an expiring lease, and a
ground landlord who would not be diverted
from his purpose even by the offer of
money, old Mr. Gayre, who was then
alive, and Mr. Edwin Gayre, his son, set
their wits together to try how little they
could do in the way of making their
bank look like any other bank of recent
date as possible.

It is only fair to say they succeeded in
their endeavour. Even to the present
hour Gayres' is a model of what a 
ought not to be. An old building
at the back, which chanced to be

their own freehold, was left untouched,
and in a portion of that edifice the Gayre
of to-day gives audience to the few persons
who ever ask to see him, and transacts
the little business it is necessary for him
to attend to. Gayres' have not gone on
with the times ; but they feel no desire
to do anything of the kind.

Banks have come and banks have gone,
but Gayres' still holds on the even tenor
of its respectable way. Though the main
part of the bank abutting on Lombard
Street was, as has been stated, brand-new
less than twenty-five years ago, it has
managed somehow to acquire during that
period quite a look of antiquity. For one .
thing, it was built on the old lines, and
kept rigidly free from any improvements of
structure or originality of design. It is as
square as the shape of the ground would
permit ; it has steps up to the door, ap-

parents with the intention of checking

62

the ardour of any stranger who might
feel disposed to rush in and open an account
; the exterior is utterly destitute of
ornament, and the inside as plain as Dissenting
chapels used to be. It is badly
lighted and not ventilated at all. The
way to the strong room is encompassed
by as many traps and perils as those
which beset Christian on his road from
the City of Destruction to the better land ;
and there is a dark step down into Mr.
Gayre's own especial sanctum which has
nearly ended the earthly career of more
than one intending client.

Any one who by some rare piece of
good fortune gets a cheque to present
across Gayres' counter feels as the narrow
half-door swings behind him that he has
stepped out of Lombard Street and the
modern days of hansom cabs, railways,
and electric light, into the seventeenth
century, and he half expects when he steps

out again to see the old signs which denoted
the goldsmiths' whereabouts in the
days when Mr. Francis Child, the first
regular banker, married Martha, only-daughter
of Robert Blanchard, citizen, and
Heed with his wife, business, and twelve
children in Fleet Street, where, to quote
Pennant, " the shop still continues in a
state of the highest respectability."

The Gayres were goldsmiths also about
the same period, and had been notable
people in the City even before the time
when their relation. Sir John Gayre, was
Lord Mayor of London. Xo mushroom
house this, eager to extend its credit by
means of cut stone and ornamented pilasters,
or to flaunt its wares in the face
of the public through plate-glass windows,
or reflect the faces of dupes in French
polished mahogany counters and brass
knobs and rails. It was quite enough
satisfaction for any man to know himself

m the books of the firm, without looking
upon his own distorted likeness in shining
furniture and glittering lacquer.

Gayres were by no means anxious to
open accounts " on the usual terms ; " indeed,
their terms, according to modern
ideas, were most unusual. They did not
even care for the " best bills ; " upon the
whole they preferred that bills of all sorts
and descriptions should be negotiated elsewhere,
and he would have been a rash
man who had ventured to ask Gayres'
manager to discount even the finest mercantile
paper.

Conservative in their ideas of trade,
though, following civic traditions, perhaps
somewhat independent and radical in politics,
Garret' notion of banking was eminently
primitive. According to the traditions
of their house a banker was a man
of substance and repute, who took care of
money for his customers. Gayres professed

to do little more than this. Like their
predecessors the Lombards, they could,
though rarely, be induced to accommodate
a well-known customer ; but the whole
transaction was fenced about with such
forms and ceremonies, prefaced by such
details, and requiring such an expenditure
of time, legal advice, and thought, that
the business " was, as a rule, transferred
to some house accustomed to more rough-and-ready
methods of procedure.

Time, to ]messrs. Gayre, Delone, Eyles,
and Gayre, might have represented eternity,
to judge from the deliberation of their movements.
To take, say, one hundred pounds
in five notes over their old Spanish mahogany
counter occupied more time than the
cashing of ten thousand might at Glen's.

But then Gayres' looked down on Glen's,
as it did on Child's. Gayres represented
itself as being more respectable than any
other banking-house in London.

Nell Wynne banked there, did she ? "
said a Gayre, long and long anterior to
the date at which this story opens ; " and
Child are proud of the fact, are they? I
wouldn't have let the hussy set foot
across our threshold."

Which remark may give the key to
Gayres' policy. Respectable, decorous, sound ;
if you had wound Gayres up at any
minute in the twenty-four hours, enough
would have been forthcoming to satisfy
everybody and leave a balance.

Yes, even in the year 1874, when the
Gayre in whose veins flowed the blood of
all the Gayres since 1647, to say nothing of
many previous generations, laid down his
claret, and astonished his guest by declaring
his sister had married Sir Geoffrey
Chelston.

As has been said, banks had come and
banks had gone, and, it may be added
banks were going; but Gates' knew no

anxiety as regarded its financial position.
The heads of the firm had not appropriated
their customers' title-deeds  a favourite form
of latter-day banking dishonesty; the security
on which their good money lay at
interest they had never found need to
mortgage. All their business lives for a
couple of centuries, at least, they had been
quiet, honest, orderly people, living well
within their income, owing no man more
than they could conveniently pay, eschewing
speculation, holding aloof from the railway
and other manias, that beggared and
crippled so many large houses in the years
preceding the great show in Hyde Park.

And yet Gayres' was not what it had
once been. It could not have counted
down guineas with some of the great banks,
as it might formerly. The principals had
not gone on with the world ; and so the
world, which latterly has got into the habit
of travelling very fast indeed, made no

scruple about leaving Gayres' behind.
Some even of their titled customers, find-nor
the old bank allowed them no interest
on balances, were contracting a nasty habit
of transferring two or three thousand pounds
at a time to the London and Westminster,
or National Provincial, or any other great
bank which had the knack of being more
considerate. They kept their accounts
still at the " old shop," which once hung
out a tortoise for its sign ; but even
country squires and Tory noblemen were
learning a few things their ancestors chanced
to be ignorant of, and seemed as anxious
and greedy to make a " tenner " as a lad
to toss for tarts.

City wags occasionally suggested it
would be the most fitting of all fitting
things if Gayres' were to hunt up the old
tortoise out of their cellars, and hang it in
the sun. Scoffers declared " Gayres' was
the slowest coach going in the city." They

wondered why, if Gavres' would not amalgamate
with a bank that ' had some life
in it," Gayres did not shut up. and cut the
City altogether ?

"And there is only this one fellow left,
and he not married," was the remark
generally made. "Why, he must be as
rich as a Jew ; " which did not happen to
be the case. Mr. Gayre was well off, very
well off, but he could not be called a
millionaire for all that.

Nicholas Gayre came of a stock more
famous for saving money than making it.
To pitch thousands about, to see gold flung
recklessly into this venture and that, would
have seemed criminal in the eyes of men
who esteemed riches a possession to be
desired, more especially when accompanied
by a good name. Thus, if they had lost
little or nothing, they had not made
fortunes in a day, like their neighbours up
and down the street. They took few

measures to extend their connection ; and
so it occasionally happened that, as the
heads of a family died off, the younger
branches carried their accounts elsewhere.

Banking, in a word, had changed its
character, and as Gayres' refused to veer
round at the bidding of the banking world
the old house came gradually to be pushed
up into a quiet business corner, like a
dowager at a ball, " whose dancing days
are over."

But it was while Jeremy Gayre and his
son Joshua  whose name figured at the
tail-end of the firm  were the actual heads
of a house in which Delone and Eyles had
long ceased to be anything save sleeping
partners, that a blow was dealt, sufficient
to have destroyed a business built on any
other foundation than the rock of honesty.

First, Delone elected to be paid out, and
then Eyles. For long previously they had
both been drawing the full share of the profits,

and when the opportunity occurred they
gladly said, paraphrasing the words of the
Prodigal Son, " Give us the portion that
falleth to us." Unlike the prodigal, however,
they did not waste their money in
riotous living ; they bought estates, and
went into mining and other speculations,
and added to their store, and married
heiresses, and took up their position among
the first in the land, while Gayres' was
left with a decreasing business and a reduced
capital. Well was it for the bank
that the then principal in the firm had always
lived, not merely well within his income,
but so as to save largely out of it.
Jeremy Gayre was, indeed, one to have satisfied
the author of Banks and Banking, who
thus drew, in pen and ink, a type of a
class now well-nigh extinct :

He " {i.e. a banker of the old school)
bore little resemblance to his modern
successor. He was a man of serious manners.

plain apparel, the steadiest conduct, and a
rigid observer of formalities. As you
looked in this face you could read, in intelligible
characters, that the ruling maxim
of his life, the one to which he turned all
his thoughts and by which he shaped all
his actions, was, that he who could be
trusted with the money of other men
should look as if he deserved the trust,
and be an ostensible pattern to society of
probity, exactness, frugality, and decorum.
He lived, if not the whole of the year, at
least the greater part of the year, at his
banking-house ; was punctual to the hours
of business, and always to be found at his
desk. The fashionable society at the
West-end of the town and the amusements
of high life he never dreamed of enjoying."


Times, even during the noon-day of Mr.
Jeremy Gayre's existence, had changed sofar
that few merchants in a lame wav of

business resided on their City premises.
The upper portions of their houses couple
utilised much more profitably, it had
been found, than as mere dwellings ; and
Mr. Gayre, who understood the full import
of that old Scotch saw which tells how
"many a pickle make a mickle," when
he married let off part of the Lombard
Street establishment, moved " west of
Temple Bar," and took up his abode in
one of the old roomy houses in Norfolk
Street, Strand.

There was no Embankment then, or
thought of one. At high tide the water
came lapping up to the railings at the
bottom of the street ; and, save at the
Strand end, there was no exit. Cabs and
vans did not go tearing and rattling over
the pavement, as is the case now ; and
the dwelling Mr. Gayre bought was as
quiet as though it had been situated in
some retired City court.

When in good course of time Joshua
Gayre, the son, took unto himself a wife,
he set up housekeeping in Brunswick
Square, where four sons and one daughter
were born and bred. Of these four sons,
Jeremy, the eldest, died before he came of
age. Edwin in due time went into the
bank, in which, while still young he was
associated as partner. John elected to take
orders ; and, in compliance with the bent
of the youngest son's inclinations, a commission
was bought for Nicholas in a
cavalry regiment.

The three were all good men and true.
They sowed no crops of wild oats for their
father and themselves to reap. Edwin
took kindly to banking, John to the
Church, Nicholas to the army. The latter
rose rapidly in the service ; he went
through the Crimean campaign; and his
regiment, crowned with distinction, had
just returned to England, when the Indian

Mutiny caused it to be again ordered off
to the East.

Five years elapsed before young Gayre,
who had fought his way to the rank of
colonel, saw his native country once more ;
then he came back in obedience to a
summons from his father.

Great trouble had fallen upon the head
of the now elderly banker. Edwin was
dead, and Margaret had left her husband.
Mr. Gayre did not see how the Lombard
Street business was to be carried on without
help, necessitated by the state of his
own broken health.

Should he take a partner, or amalgamate
with some other firm ; or would nicholas
leave the army, and fill the place left
vacant by the death of his elder brother?
Xicholas took a week to consider, and then,
to his father's infinite joy, signified his
willingness to devote himself to commerce.

With a clear head and a stout heart he

Vol. i. 7

set to work to master the mysteries and
intricacies of banking ; and if Gayres' had
been a different establishment, one in which
the energies of an active man might have
found full scope, there can be little question
he would in the commercial world have
risen to eminence.

But without changing entirely the lines
on which the business had hitherto been
conducted, he soon saw it would be vain
to attempt to make the old bank a monetary
power in the City. It might preserve its
character for unspotted respectability, and
for a honos time be made still to return a
fair income ; but no great financial future
could be hoped for a house which had
voluntarily dropped behind in the commercial
race, and wilfully shut its eyes to
the great changes for good or for evil
being permanently wrought by steam,
electricity, luxury, limited liability, the
destruction of old landmarks, the extravagance

of the Upper Ten, and, in the lower

stratum of society, the determination of

Jack to be as good as his master.

All this did not trouble Mr. Nicholas

Gayre to any very great extent ; and yet

it would be idle to deny that it was a

disappointed man who, leaning over the

railings in Hjde Park on that May day

when Mr. Arbery's bay mare indulged in

such wild antics, saw Susan Drummond

for the first time. When he unbuckled

his sword and took up the pen, when he

exchanged the saddle for a seat in his

father's office, there can be no question he

relinquished a great deal ; but till he tried

the experiment he fancied he should be

able to find sufficient excitement in the

heart of the City to compensate him, in

part at least, for the career in which,

when he abandoned it, he had so rapidly

been rising to distinction.

By degrees he learnt he and his people

7-2

were not made of the stuff out of which,
at this time of the world's history, celebrated
financiers are fashioned. The game was
to be played, but not by him. Great
things were possible, but not to Nicholas
Gayre ; aud so, feeling he was out of the
running, he stepped quietly aside and
watched the mercantile game, where, as a
rule, the stakes were power or poverty,
wealth or bankruptcy, a baronetcy or
outlawry, with a certain cynical pleasure
he might not have derived from the contemplation
of greater things.

Never, perhaps, in the history of the
City of London was there a better time
for observing the humours of commercial
speculation than the years immediately
following his introduction to business
life.

The wild speculation, the reckless private
expenditure, the sudden madness of all
classes ; the swamping of little men, the

absorption of small concerns into large,
the wholesale annexation of many Naboth's
vineyards in order that the great houses
might have even " larger gardens of
herbs; the pulling down and the rearing
up ; the pomp, the pride, the extravagance ;
the belief that the tide of apparent prosperity,
then running so strong, would never
turn  these things, and many more of the
same kind, were for a time  only a short
time, though  stopped by the collapse of

In one minute, as it seemed, the Corner
House tottered and crashed in ; and fora
while banks kept failing, firms stopping,
old-established businesses tottering. Throughout
the whole of England  from orphans
who were left penniless, from widows
stripped of their incomes, from country
rectory and hall and cottage  arose an
exceeding bitter cry of "mourning and
desolation and woe '*

See the end of these men, Nicholas,"
said old Mr. Gayre to his son. The prosperity
of many a mushroom concern had
tried the banker's faith  indeed, it is not
too much to say there were times when he
felt he " had washed his hands in innocency
in vain ; " but now, as he looked at the
commercial ruin hastened by the collapse
of the Corner House, he shook his head
gravely. " ' I have seen the wicked in great
power,' he quoted, ' and spreading himself
like a green bay-tree. Yet he passed away,
and, lo, he was not : yea, I sought him,
but he could not be found.' We have
great cause for thankfulness," added Mr.
Gayre, after a moment's pauses and truly
such was the case.

Weighed in the balance of that terrible
panic, Gayres' was not found wanting.
Every security was safe in the strong-room
; the bank needed no help  nays it
found itself able to give assistance ; through

the ordeal it passed in quiet triumph ; and
yet, eight years later, Mr. Nicholas Gayre
could not be regarded as a perfectly contented
man.

His being a nature which coveted success,
it was scarcely to be expected he should
feel satisfied with having merely compassed
safety. " And yet," as himself remarked,
safety is a very good thing when it means
the possession of a comfortable income."

i ay

pALKING leisurely towards that
JyMg "crib" hard by the Eegent's Park
which Sir Geoffrey Chelston had appropriated
as coolly as the cuckoo does the
hedge-sparrow's nest, Mr. Gayre employed
his niind in dissecting the motives which
were taking him to North Bank. Love
for his brother-in-law could certainly not
be reckoned amongst them. In every
capacity of life  as man, as gentleman,
as baronet, as husband, father, friend,
relative  Sir Geoffrey was distasteful to
him. Only for one thing had Mr. Gayre
ever felt grateful to the well-born sinner.
Sir Geoffrey's life had been so openly shameful

that it was vain for him ever to think
of suing for a divorce. Lady Chelston was
Lady Chelston still  living abroad in the
strictest retirement on a pension duly paid
to her every half-year by the solicitors of
Messrs. Gayre and Co. The scandal, now
an old story, was confined to the knowledge
of a very few persons ; it had never
been a nine days' wonder or a case for the
courts. Sir Geoffrey held his tongue about
the woman who had made such a wreck
of her life, and society did not trouble itself
to ask whether the disreputable Baronet
were married or a widower. It knew in
either state he was not fit to associate with.
Voluntarily he had placed himself outside
the pale as well of intimacy as curiosity,
and no one thought of being inquisitive concerning
him. To the Gayres the Chelston
connection had ever been a source of loss,
annoyance, and disgrace, and it was not
love for his brother-in-law that could be

one of the reasons now drawing Mr. Garret
the unaccustomed pastures of the Eegent's
Park.

Given to sarcastic analysis of the motives
of others, no one could accuse Mr. Gayre
of undue lenity towards his own. It was
not as a censor he regarded the foibles of
his fellows ; on the contrary, his great failing
happened to be that he looked on life
unconsciously, perhaps  as a bystander
at a game. He knew all the moves and
tricks and subterfuges, and he watched the
play with a cynical interest which even
extended to the working of his own
heart.

Surprised perhaps at finding a Human
weakness in that great citadel, he would
trace its birth and career with a curious and
intelligent attention. As some persons have
a mania for the study of bodily disease,
his craze was to watch the manifestation
of mental sin and folly. Making due

allowance for original temperament, it might
be said his nature had grown up malformed
by reason of two accidents in early life.
There was good m him and there was bad,
and he would have assured any questioner
solemnly there was neither bad nor good,
that he was an utter negative ; that he had
no pleasure except in watching a woman
spin a web, and then invite some fly who
thought himself very clever to walk across
and see what a beautiful web it was, or,
greater ecstacy still, noting the process by
which one big thief was robbed by a bigger.
Finding so little to do in Lombard Street he
had turned his attention to these matters ;
and having at length decided to go to North
Bank, it was most unlikely he would arrive
there till he had ascertained why he had
decided to call.

Given," he thought, " ten parts, there
is one to form some slight conjecture how
my precious brother-in-law, without a penny

of visible income, without property, celia
racer, or friends, manages to shuffle along.
Shall we say one for that, or is it too
much ? We'll say one. Two  because I
really can look no longer at my sister's
child making such an exhibition of herself,
and feel constrained to stretch out a
hand which may save her or  may not.
Then there is Sudlow worrying me to death
to introduce him. We'll put a half for that
three and a half out of ten ; how much
is that per cent, in City phrase ? Never
mind ; it leaves six and a half for the girl
with the brown eyes, and the wonderful
hair, and the pure complexion ; that is a
large proportion. Nicholas, my friend, you
had better mind what you are at. It's a
case, I'm afraid, of either kill or cure ;
you'll either find the first half-dozen words
you hear her speak disenchant you totally,
or else  you've met your fate. But I haven't
met her yet," he added more cheerfully 

only seen her once with the breadth of
the Eow between us  and for that matter,
I may never meet her anywhere, or see
her again."

Having arrived at which conclusion, he
turned down North Bank, and sought the
residence of his kinsman.

Everyone acquainted with North Bank
knows exactly the sort of house, secluded
inside high walls, which obtains on the
preferable or canal side of the way ; the
mysterious postern-gate that, being opened,
discloses three yards of gravelled path, a
few evergreens, some trellis-work, and a
peep of greensward and water beyond ;
houses small, it may be, but capable of
being in their style made anything  which,
indeed, they often are  save respectable.

Mr. Gayre smiled grimly as he recognised
the type of dwelling, and asked the irreproachable
Lavender, who, in striped waistcoat,
without his coat, and in what he

modestly called his " small clothes," answered
the bell,

"Is Sir Geoffrey in?"

Lavender did not know in the least who
the new-comer might be ; but he looked
at the erect carriage, the trim cut-away
coat, not half an inch too wide, not a
quarter of an inch two small ; at the
cropped head, the military moustache, the
quiet tie, the trousers and waistcoat ensuite,
the command in the cold gray eye,
and decided,

Here at last is somebody decent come
to see master."

"Well, sir," he answered, shocked at
his deshabille and the consciousness there
was no one to do the honours, " Sir
Geoffrey is in, but he's not up. He did
not come home till late last night, and
he has not yet rung his bell."

Which was, indeed, within the letter of
truth ; for Sir Geoffrey had not come

home till so late last night that the water-carts
were abroad before he made his
appearance, and when he did come was
so drunk Lavender had no expectation of
hearing his bell till late in the afternoon.

"I ought to have taken that first check,"
said Mr. Gayre to himself in the days to
come ; but he did not, and went on, '' Is
Miss Chelston at home ? "

Yes, sir," answered Lavender ; " but  "

"If you take in my card, she will seeme,"
said Mr. Gayre ; " I am her uncle."

"I knew it," affirmed Lavender, subsequently
; " I knew it was somebody decent
come to the house at last."

"If you'll walk in, sir, please," he observed
to Mr. Gayre; and that gentleman
was consequently shown into the morning-room
of young Mr. Moreby's lady-love 
that lady-love whose doings, and more
especially whose spending, had so distracted
the soul of Mrs. Moreby, widow.

"Humph!" reflected Mr. Gayre, looking
round the apartment, which was about
eleven feet by seven ; "a fool and his
money are soon parted."

If you will be pleased to walk this
way, sir," repeated Lavender, who, having
seized the opportunity of donning a coat,
now felt himself quite a master of the
ceremonies ; then, flinging wide the 
door, he announced " Mr. Gayre."

There was something so ludicrous about
the whole business that Mr. Gayre could
have laughed in his sleeve, had he not
felt it was bad form on his niece's part
to wait till he had crossed the small hall
and entered the charming apartment overlooking
the canal ere coming to make his
acquaintance.

"She is not a duchess," he thought ;
and, considering where I find her, she
might be a little more natural. however
 "

And so at last I see my niece," he
said aloud ; and then Lavender discreetly-closed
the door, and Mr. Gayre found
himseK alone with a most lovely young
woman, who, in the shyest manner, gave
him her hand and timidly held up her
face, so that he could kiss her if he
liked.

Which he did, though with no very
great good-will ; and yet there were ten
thousand young men in London, to say
the least of it, who would have availed
themselves of such a chance with effusion.


Well, well, thus runs the world away,
and it is only natural that it should.

And so at last I see my niece," Mr.
Gayre repeated, which, for so usually
ready an individual, seemed a needless
waste of words. " Let me look at you
in the light ; " and, framing her cheeks
between his hands, he drew her towards

Vol. i. 8

one of the windows. " If you are only
as good as you are pretty," he said,
releasing her.

"0, I  don't think, uncle, I am so very
bad," she answered, with delightful confusion.


How far are you off your copy-book
days?" asked Mr. Gayre.

What a funny question ! Nine or ten,
I suppose."

"Then you remember self-praise is no
recommendation."

0, how dreadful, uncle ! I did not
mean to praise myself. no ! I'm very,
very sure of that, because  "

What is your name, my dear ? " he
interrupted.

Marguerite," she answered.

And your mother was called Margaret.
Well, perhaps better so."

They talked together in the house fora
while ; then they walked out on the

sharply sloping lawn for a time longer,
she with a dainty parasol over her wealth
of dark-brown hair, he bare-headed. Then
they returned to the drawing-room, and
after she had drawn the blinds half-down
they exhausted, as it seemed to Mr. Gayre,
all topics of ordinary interest, and he was
just racking his brain to think what he
should say to her next, when the door
opened and Sir Geoffrey Chelston  clean,
clothed, and in his right mind, and on
his very, very best behaviour  entered the
apartment.

"I take this very kind of you, Gayre,"
he said  " deucedly kind indeed," he added-and
soothed and cheered by these amenities,
Mr. Gate resumed his seat.

By dint of long endeavours to keep

his hat on three hairs, Sir Geoffrey had

contracted a habit of shaking his head,

which caused many persons when first

introduced to imagine (erroneously) he was

82

afflicted with palsy or some other disease,
which had somewhat impaired both his
bodily and mental powers.

Under this impression they were wont
to challenge him to play billiards and
other games, to take his bets, and all
that sort of thing, and come signally to
grief.

If subsequently they departed cursing
him, surely Sir Geoffrey was not to blame.
It was only a habit ; but some men's
habits are useful, and his proved eminently
so.

"This is your first introduction to your
niece, isn't it ? " observed Sir Geoffrey,
after a few interesting remarks had been
made about the weather and the locality.

Well, and what do you think of her ?"
he went on, with a knowing twitch of
his head, when his brother-in-law had signified
acquiescence with the previous proposition.
"She's not so bad, is she?"

I have already taken the liberty of
remarking to her that if she is only as
good as she is pretty  "

Ay, that's the thing," interrupted Sir
Geoffrey ; as though he himself were such
a paragon of virtue, the mere idea of
naughtiness proved repugnant to his moral
sense ; " that's what I used to say to
her and Susan, ' Beauty's only skin deep,'
Handsome is as handsome does.' Haven't
I told you so a hundred times over,
Peggy, when you were going to fly at
Susan and scratch the ten commandments
over her face because I said she was
prettier than you ? "

I feel no doubt you have," answered
Peggy, with a tender smile, which was
somewhat belied by a look in her eyes
that made Mr. Gayre fancy in her heart
she desired nothing better at that moment
than to grave some lines on Sir Geoffrey's
sallow cheek.

"Who was Susan?" asked the banker.
I always thought you had never but
the one daughter."

That's right enough  no more I had.
Who was Susan ? why, the merriest Httle
lass in the whole world, and fond of me,
too  far fonder than my own child ever
was. Lord ! it seems no longer ago than
yesterday when she used to come running
across the lawn, aud say to me, with
both her little arms round my knees,
"Dive me a wide, papa Geoff ; didn't
she, Peg?"

"I have no doubt she did," Peg replied,
with another smile.

"Doubt!" repeated Sir Geoffrey; "why,
you know she did, just as well as you
know what a nice passion you used to get
into when anybody said she had a better
complexion than you."

I was only a child, papa," reminded
Miss Chelston.

"Ay, only a child," agreed the Baronet,
with another indescribable twitch ; " and
now you're a young woman, there's no
need for you to be jealous of anybody,
though I say it. And that brings us back
to what your uncle remarked, that he
hoped you were as good as you were
pretty."

Well, you are a strange pair," considered
Mr. Gayre, contemplating parent
and child with admiration.

And this Miss Susan," he suggested 
is she not pretty now ? "

yes, she is," said Sir Geoffrey, *' but
she's not as handsome as my girl there.
Those very fair children somehow don't
look so well at twenty as at six. I can't
tell why. Susan's good, though, that
she is."

Having dealt his daughter which backhanded
compliment, and leaving both his
hearers to take whatever meaning they

pleased out of it, the Baronet proposed an
adjournment to the next apartment.

'you must have a glass of claret, Hereafter
your walk." he declared, with the
hospitable warmth of a man who gets his
claret for nothing. Mr. Gayre did not want
the wine, but he accepted the proffered
civility, as he wished to speak to his
brother-in-law alone.

"Xow look here," exclaimed Sir Geoffrey,
piloting the way to the dining-room, " take
some champagne, do  claret's an un-english,
ungenial sort of tipple, except when one
can't get anything else. I have some first-rate
champagne, as you'll say when you
taste it, and I'm going to have some myself.
Champagne and soda-water is the
best " pick up " I know, and, to tell
you the truth, I feel I need a pick up
of some sort. We did keep the ball
moving last night. I'd have been right
enough if I'd never gone to bed ; but now

my head seems spinning round and round,
like a coach-wheel. You'll have champagne?
That's right, with just a dash of
brandy in it. I always advise the brandy;
champagne's cold without, and, some people
find, absolutely unwholesome too."

Mr. Gayre said he would venture upon
the champagne minus the brandy ; and this
point being amicably settled, Sir Geoffrey,
to show he was not recommending what
he feared to practise, followed up the first
prescription he ordered for himself with
that he advised for his brother-in-law ;
after which proceeding, regarded by Mr.
Gare with curiosity, not to say awe, the
Baronet stated he felt much better  "fit
for anything, in fact."

"You've dropped into a nice place here,"
said the banker, as he and Sir Geofirey
sauntered down the garden. "You might
be a hundred miles in the country."

Yes, it's quiet enough in all conscience,"

was the reply ; " fact is, it's too quiet and
out-of-the-way for me. Still, we can't have
everything ; and the little cottage costs me
nothing. Moreby  capital young fellow 
lent it to me."

So I heard," remarked Mr. Gayre ; and
he might have added he had also heard
how Mr. Moreby came to lend it.

His mother took him abroad all in a
hurry, and not an hour too soon," explained
the new occupier, in the tone of a man
who is paid for denouncing vice at the
rate of about a guinea a word. " He was
going a pace! Why, just look how this
house is furnished ! I only wish I had the
money it must have cost him."

Eeally, to hear Sir Geoffrey talk, anyone
might have imagined he had never
possessed a spare sixpence or been given a
solitary chance in Iiis life.

"It was too good an opportunity to let
sHp," he went on, finding his brother-in-law

made no comment on the desire last expressed,
" for I had not a roof to put
my head under. Don't think that would
have troubled me though ; I can live anywhere
and on anything. I'd as soon sleep
on the floor as not ; and nobody ever
heard me object to gin when I could not
get Aliquot ; " and having, in the contemplation
of his own self-denial, almost
dropped his hat. Sir Geoffrey shook it on
again with the conscious rectitude of a
person earning two pounds per week by
hard labour, and contriving to save fifteen
shillings out of it.

"But it was my daughter," he said, after
a slight pause. " I couldn't let the girl
remain without a shelter, however willing
I might be to make shift myself."

"It was a difficult position, certainly,"
observed Mr. Gayre, feeling this concession
could not compromise him.

Difficult ! I believe you ! Give you

my word, I could not sleep o' nights
wondering what on earth I was to do with
her ; " a statement which, as Sir Geoffrey
very rarely slept of nights, usually soundly
reposing by day, meant less than it might
otherwise have done.

You called her Marguerite, she tells me."

Faith, that I did not, or anybody else,
so far as I know, except herself. Her
right name is Margaret, of course, but she
thinks Marguerite fits her better, somehow;
and if it pleases her, I am sure it may
please me."

Has she many friends in London ? "
asked Mr. Gayre.

Many !  not a soul ; I don't know what
to do with her, or how to set about
getting her acquaintances. Time slips away;
and I can't tell how long I shall be able
to keep this house. It's confoundedly
awkward altogether, for something ought
to be doing."

You want to get her married, I suppose
? "

If I can," answered Sir Geoffrey, breaking
off a bay-leaf and eating it with great
apparent relish.

"You'll not compass your object, I'm
afraid, by sending her out in the Park."

Have you seen her there, then ? " said
Sir Geoffrey, reddening under his brother-in-law's
steady gaze.

Yes ; that is how I knew you were
in town. You had better let her abandon
equestrian exercise. In the first place, she
can't ride."

JSFo, indeed, she can't," groaned Sir
Geoffrey ; " if she could she'd have been
worth a fortune, in a way of speaking.
But she'll never be of any use to me 
not the least in the world ; she hasn't
a notion of making herself useful. Why,
with her appearance  "

You will have to be careful what you

are about," interposed Mr. Gayre, with
decision. "You must get some lady of
position to introduce her."

"I don't know who that lady is to be,
then," retorted Sir Geoffrey. " If you can
find her, I shall feel mightily obliged to
you. It's all very easy to talk, but I can
tell you it's not so easy to do. Why,
there's my own second cousin on the
mother's side. Lady Digley. When I was
a boy the old people thought it would bea
fine thing to make up a match between
us ; and she was brought down to
the Pleasaunce on view. But I couldn't
stand her nose  too much of the Coriolanus,
Eoman-senator-business, about that
nose. However, as I was saying, I wrote
to her, telling her my daughter was in
London, and mentioning the girl's good
looks, and so on, and in plain words
asking would she take her up."

Well ? " inquired Mr. Gayre.

"The old hag sent an answer by return.
Lady Digley presented her compliments, and
the rest of it, and Lady Digley regretted to
say circumstances over which she had no
control compelled her to decline the honour
of making the acquaintance of Miss Chelston.
Damn her ! " added Sir Geofirey, with great
fervour, referring to Lady Digley, and not to
his own daughter.

Mr. Gayre made no remark for a few
minutes, but stood looking thoughtfully down
upon the canal.

The situation undoubtedly was awkward ;
and it did not seem as if any fresh revelation
was likely to improve its aspect.

"Why did you bring her to town at
all at present ? " he asked, after a pause,
during which Sir Geoffrey, looking as much
unlike a dove as possible, plucked another
leaf.

Why ? " repeated that gentleman ; "because
I had no other place to leave her. It

seems to me, Gayre, you don't at all understand
how I am situated."

"I think I do," was the reply; "but had
you no friends near your old place with
whom the girl could have stayed for a
while ? "

Deuce a friend," answered Sir Geoffrey.
"Believe me, my dear fellow, when a man
has got to the bottom of the hill, those
who were civil to him at the top find it
convenient to forget the fact of his existence."


But your daughter," urged Mr. Gayre ;
young people form acquaintances for themselves,
and, as a rule, the young are not
mercenary. Was there no single door held
wide to welcome my niece ? "

"Not one."

"But think  for example, that Susan you
were speaking of just now, did she hang
back ? "

Susan Drummond ? No, she did not

hang back ; but she had nothing in her
power. You see, about the time that things
got to the worst with us her uncle died, and
she had to clear out. She wrote me as nice
a letter as you could wish to read. She was
always fond of me, poor Susan! I know
she thought a deal of me," added the Baronet
almost sentimentally.

Mr. Gayre looked askance at Sir Geoffrey,
and wondered what in the world any girl or
woman could see personally or mentally to
admire in the disreputable jockey and battered
roue.

"There is no accounting for the caprices
of the sex," he decided, and reverted to the
original question.

It will save us both a great deal of time
if I am quite plain with you," he said, almost
smiling as he spoke in Sir Geoffrey's slowly-lengthening
face. " I don't mean you to
dip deeper into my pocket than you have
done ; but as regards my niece, I should

Vol. i. 9

like her, at all events, to have a chance of
making something better of life than an utter
failure. For this reason I will see whether,
amongst my own connection, I cannot find
some one to chaperone her ; you must do
your part, however. Keep her in the background
till she can come to the front properly.
Could you not, meantime, get some
lady to reside in the house, as governess or
companion, eh ? "

Well, I'm afraid not," answered Sir Geoffrey.
" We've tried that sort of thing before,
and though I am sure I was always most
courteous and careful, still, ' once give a dog
a bad name,' you know ; the respectable ones
wouldn't stop, and  "

Mr. Gayre laughed outright. "We
need scarcely pursue the other side of the
question," he said, a decision which, on
the whole, proved rather a relief to the
Baronet.

"If your daughter had even some young

friend stopping with her for a time," suggested
Mr. Gayre. " Where is that Miss
Drummond ? wouldn't she come ? "

I daresay she would ; she spent more
than half her time at Ch els ton Pleasaunce.
Yes, she'd come fast enough ; but then, you
see, I don't know where she is."

"But your daughter does, no doubt."
Sir Geoffrey shook his head dubiously.
I don't think so," he said.

"Ask her," advised Mr. Gayre ; " there
she is."

And, indeed, there Miss Chelston was,
framed within an open window, to which
her father at once advanced.

Where is Susan Drummond now, do you
know ? " he asked ; and Mr. Gayre, standing
a step or two behind, watched her face as
she answered,

Susan Drummond, papa. I haven't an
idea. She was in Ireland, staying with some

people who live near Killarney."

92

"But you've an address where you can
write to her ? "

Miss Chelston lifted her beautiful eyes and
looked at her father, as she answered, in the
accents of utter truthfulness, "She did tell
me where an aunt lived who would always
forward on any letters ; but I have mislaid
the direction, and quite forget what it was."

After that ! " thought Mr. Gayre ; and his
meditations as he strolled through Eegent's
Park homeward, were of a more unpleasant
character than those with which he had
amused himself a couple of hours previously.

A POSSIBLE SAMARITAN.

T is one thing to ask friends to " take
up " a girl, and quite another to get
to do it.

This was Mr. Gayre's experience, at all
events. He went very heartily into the business,
in the first instance full of faith and
hope, and later on with a species of desperation.


Margaret's child ! " repeated his brother,
now a great dignitary of the Church, with
a town house in Onslow square, Rector
of Little Fishermen, Canon of Worcester
Cathedral, Chaplain to the Queen, and
Heaven only knows what besides  'margaret's
child ! Ask Matilda to invite her to

this house and introduce her to our friends !
My dear Nicholas, the thing is an utter impossibility.
I would not for any consideration
prefer such a petition to my wife."

Why not ? " demanded Mr. Gayre.

"It is a matter into which I really must
decline entering. Your own usually excellent
sense should tell you it is out of the
question persons in our position could fora
moment entertain the idea of bringing forward
the child of our unfortunate sister,
and the daughter of that most disreputable
reprobate Sir Geoffrey Chelston. Our dear
Fanny and sweet Julia are not aware even
of the existence ot such a cousin. And you
say she is in London ; what a dreadful misfortune
! "

Every one was in the same story ; the words
might be different, but the sense proved the
same. Sir Geoffrey rich might have managed
to slip his daughter through a camel's eye
into the social heaven presided over by Mrs.

Grundy ; but Sir Geoffrey without an acre of
land, with no balance at his banker's, Having
on his wits, regarded by gentlemen of his
own order as a very leper, had not a
chance.

"I reckoned without mine host," said Mr.
Gayre to the Baronet Bagot. "It is not to
be done."

I told you so at the beginning,"
answered Sir Geoffrey, who, if he had
learned nothing else from experience, could
not help knowing the sort of reception any
creature belonging to him was likely to meet
with from the fashionable world. " You
meant it all kindly, Gayre, I know ; but there
is no use in trying to kick against the pricks.
You had better stop in your own comfortable
home, and not trouble about us 
folks up here. If Margaret and I
cannot swim together  and it seems we can
neither of us do that  we must sink; and
the Baronet, as he concluded, regarded his

brother-in-law furtively out of the corner of
one knowing eye, for he was wondering what
on earth this latest benefactor meant to do,
if not for him, for his daughter.

Confound him ! " considered Sir Geoffrey,
why does he not adopt her ? If he took
her to Wimpole Street, and got some dashing
widow to patronise her, and hinted he meant
to give her a handsome dot he might pick
and choose a husband for her. Ah, if I
had only in my power what he has in his,
I'd soon bring the old dowagers who have
sons about me, begging and praying for my
daughter's company! But he's only a duffer,
that's what he is, spite of his military
achievements and the old bank at his
back. Lord, how lucky some men are ! "
and Sir Geoffrey, with his hat more on one
side of his head than ever, wended his
virtuous way to pluck the latest pigeon
good fortune had made him acquainted
with.

'' K Gayre were in my shoes he'd starve,
that's what Gayre would do," he decided ;
and he walked along thinking what a clever
fellow Sir Geoffrey Chelston was, and what
a fool Nicholas Gayre. "Still, I should like
to know his notion about Peggy, because he
has some notion, I'll swear."

Sir Geoffrey would have been very wronging
swearing anything of the kind. Mr.
Gayre had no fixed notion whatever concerning
the divine Marguerite. He wanted
her to marry well ; but he failed exactly to
see how, weighted as she was, she could
marry at all.

I should say," was the result of Mr.
Gayre's mental reflections, " That she is as
awkward a girl to get ' settled ' as ever I
saw in my life. India would be the place
for her ; and yet I don't know. She might
get a husband on the voyage out, most
likely ; but then it is not every husband
that would suit her. If she could have been

properly brought out in London  but I see
that is not to be thought of."

There was one way this might have been
accomplished  one way which would have
suited Sir Geoffrey and his niece extremely
well ; but it is only justice to that excellent
sense Canon Gayre, in his suave voice and
best pastoral manner, declared Nicholas
possessed, to say the idea of adopting his
niece had never once crossed the banker's
mind.

Even had he taken to her, which indeed
was not the case, he would have thought
a long time ere installing himself as a
parent to another man's child, and that man
Geoffrey Chelston. About Nicholas Gayre
there was nothing much stronger than his
strong common sense  that sense which
induced him, when he went down to war
amongst the City Philistines, to drop the
title of Colonel, and sink into simple Mr.
Gave.

I've seen," he said, " vans going about
the City with ' Dr. Hercules Smith, blood-manure
manufacturer,' and ' Sir Reginald
Jones & Co., patent stench-trap makers,'
painted upon them. Thank you, nothing of
that sort for me. I have no fancy to figure
as Colonel Gayre, banker, like the fellow
in the Volunteers who puts on his busi-
ness-card, ' Major Robinson, waste-paper
dealer.' '

Upon the whole, excessive virtue has a
great deal to answer for. Its action, as regarded
Margaret Chelston, had certainly the
effect of making Mr. Gayre wonder whether,
after all, there might not be some merit
in vice.

'' I need no man to remind me "  thus
ran his thoughts  "what a black, disreputable,
sinful old sheep Chelston is ; but hang
it ! surely if John's religion has any reality,
that ought to make him more anxious to
help the girl. She is not answerable for

her father's faults ; and after all, she is
Margaret's child."

During the course of the stormy correspondence
which ensued on the Marguerite
question between the Canon and his brother,
the banker made some unpleasant remarks,
which the Eev. John took as personal
injuries, concerning the priest and the
Levite who past by on the other side, and
left to a Samaritan their proper work of
tending the man who had fallen among
thieves.

Nicholas, being at the time not merely
very angry, and greatly disappointed, but
possessed by a gibing devil, which at times
rent," and caused him to foam at the
mouth," ransacked the New and Old Testament
for texts concerning the pride and
worldliness of priests and Levite, to hurl
at his brother's head. The Canon simply
ducked," and declined the contest ; he
would not argue, he said, with a man in so

unfit " a state of mind. He promised to
remember him in prayer. He alluded to St.
Paul's oft-quoted statement concerning evil
communications corrupting good manners,
and mildly hinted he feared communication
with that evil thing Sir Geofirey Chelston
was corrupting the small amount of morality
Nicholas had brought with him out of the
army.

In good truth, John Gayre was as furious
as a Christian and a canon of Worcester
might be. In orders he had done remarkably
well ; yet, since the death of his eldest
brother, he had often felt that, but for
orders, he might have done much better.
Further, he never really loved Nicholas ; and
Nicholas, on his part, had not fraternised
with " canoness " Gayre and the mnior
canonesses Gayre as he ought to have done.
When dear Julia published a song for the
benefit of the Lambeth Shoe and Stocking
Society, Nicholas suggested, first, it was

brought out less to benefit bare-footed
Lambeth than as a bid for a future primacy ;
and then offered to buy up the edition and
sell it for waste paper, on condition she
forswore musical composition ever after ;
whilst he criticised so mercilessly some
angelic " hymns written by our sweet
Fanny, that the Canon's favourite child,
feeling all moderate Church views vanity,
and meeting with a sympathetic " priest,"
was for some time in danger of going over
to the Naturalists, which would indeed have
proved a most grievous slap in the face
for that party from whose hands Canon
Gayre hoped some day to receive a mitre.

Altogether, a great division seemed imminent
in the Gayre camp one morning, in
the fine June following that late May when
Mr. Sudlow, leaning over the rails in Hyde
Park, admired rank and beauty as, embodied
in Miss Chelston, it rode timidly along the
Eow.

Mr. Gayre, banker, walking Cityward, had
left an extremely nasty letter behind him in
Wimpole Street, emanating from Mr. Gayre,
Canon. It went into money matters, always
a fatal and terrible subject to select for
family correspondence. It expressed quite
plainly, grievances which had never before
been more than hinted at. It referred to
one topic, regarding which Nicholas desired
forgetfulness ; and it said a man who
voluntarily permitted himself to become
entangled for a second time with Sir Geoffrey
Chelston could only be considered a fit candidate
for the nearest lunatic asylum.

Moderate," proceeded Canon Areas
you must be too well aware, my means
are, in comparison with what I expected,
and had a right to expect, they would prove,
I should not have hesitated joining you in
settling a small annuity on the daughter of
our unfortunate and erring sister ; but to be
exposed to your insolence because I refuse

to disgrace my cloth by taking, as a mate
of my house and the associate of my wife
and daughters, the child of a blacken and
a woman who forgot what was due to her
name and her sex, is more almost than I
can bear. Happily, however, I am not vindictive,
and I shall earnestly pray you may
never hereafter find some of the texts of
that Scripture you now so painfully wrest,
applicable to yourself.  Faithfully your
sorrowing brother."

There was so much " excellent sense," common
sense, worldly sense, plain useful sense,
in this epistle, that it stung Nicholas to the
quick. So far as money matters went, he felt
himself blameless. He knew, if no one else
did, his father had made a fair will, and left
John as much or more in hard cash as the
business would stand. He remembered the
annuity paid to his sister came out of his
own pocket ; he was aware that, had he
not given up a profession to which he was

devoted, Join's large income Avould have
been considerably smaller ; he understood
perfectly what his brother wanted was a
share in the bank, if not for himself, at least
for one son-in-law, or perhaps two sons-in-law.
It was not as regarding  s. d. the
letter irritated, though it hurt ; no arrow
the Canon shot really found its mark, save
that which criticised the prudence of his
conduct regarding Margaret No. 2.

He was well aware he had acted on an
impulse he was powerless to control, and
Mr. Nicholas Gayre did not like to act on
impulse.

Canon Gayre himself could not have looked
with more disfavour on such a freak than
the banker of Lombard Street.

However," thought that gentleman, " I
have gone in for my niece, and I shall try if
I cannot ' see her through.' The materials
are not promising; nevertheless, I thmk
something may be done. The world is not

Vol 3. 10

bounded by my own social horizon, and it is
inhabited by a good many other people
besides Canon John and Lady Digley  only,
who is going to play the part of good Samaritan
? "

A pertinent question, truly. Mr. Gayre
had gone the round of his own friends, and
met with " No," for answer in every tone
and every form of words a negative could
be uttered. It was clearly of no use expecting
help from Sir Geoffrey ; and so far
the young lady herself appeared either
unable or unwilling to mention the name of
any person with whom she could take up
her abode, or who might be induced to
enter the gates of North Bank as an honoured
guest.

Still," considered Mr. Gayre, " the
thing is to be done, and I must do it, if only
to take the canoness ' down a peg ;' " inspirited
by which idea, the banker mended
his pace, and, walking briskly Cityward,

reached Lombard Street just as the clock
of St. Mary Woolnoth chimed half-past
eleven.

On the top step of the three which at
Gayres' afforded departing customers that
number of chances for breaking a Hmb the
banker beheld an apparition which filled
him with ire. It took the bodily form of
Lavender, but behind it Mr. Gayre knew
stood the prompting figure of Sir Geoffrey.
Now, he had told that worthy in plain and
unmistakable language he must not ask him
for money or appear at the bank. "Here
is the first breach of our convention," he
muttered, acknowledging with but scant
courtesy Lavender's pleased and respectful
greeting, and receiving the letter written by
the Baronet's own hand in a somewhat ungracious
manner.

"I took it to Wimpole Street, sir," explained
the man, "but you had just left;

and as Sir Geoffrey he wanted an answer

102

very particular, I got on a bus, and came
here as fast as I could."

"Don't stand there," answered Mr. Gayre
testily. " I can't attend to you for a few
minutes  wait inside till I am at leisure."
And having thus successfully snubbed poor
Lavender, and permitted the bank porter,
and consequently every clerk in the establishment,
to see there was " something up
with the governor," he walked into his own
room, still holding Sir Geoffrey's envelope
unopened in his hand.

There was a pile of letters awaiting his
attention, and to these  laying aside the
Baronet's epistle, as though some serpent
might be expected to crawl out of it  he
first addressed himseK.

Almost at the bottom of the heap he
came upon a tinted envelope, with an imposing
crest wrought in silver for seal. The
banker smiled as he drew out the enclosure,
and read :

'' Brunswick Square, Wednesday,
"Dear !Mr. Gayre,  As usual, I am in
trouble, and also as usual I ask you to advise
and help me.

My poor little Ida is still ailing, and
Dr. Tenby says I must get her out of town.
He does not want her to go far away, as it
will be necessary for him to see her frequently.
He recommends me to take a
house in the country, and yet near London 
for, sweet darling, she is so delicate, she requires
every possible home comfort. There
is a place to let near Chislehurst (furnished)
which, from the description I have
received of it, would, I think, suit her
exactly; but, alas, I am chained to the sofa
with a sprained ankle. There is no hope
of my being able to walk for weeks ; and
the agent writes that the house is sure
to be snapped up immediately. What
am I to do? Have you any elderly
and reliable clerk who could go down

and bring back a faithful report of "The
Warren ? "

Of course, whatever expenses might be
incurred I should' be only two happy to
pay. I am always encroaching on your
kindness ; but I know you vill forgive me.
Is not the weather lovely now? It does
seem so dreadful to be pent indoors, with
the sun shining and the birds singing. 
Yours very sincerely,

Eliza Gubbins's."

"Eliza Jubbins will be the Good Samaritan,"
said Mr. Gayre aloud in triumph. "I
wonder how I could be so stupid as never
even to think of her ; " and seizing a pen,
he wrote back :

'" Dear Mrs. Gubbins,  I will go to Chislehurst
for you with much pleasure. Tell
me to whom I must apply for an order.
When I call with a full report I shall hope
to find you and Ida much better.  Yours
faithfully, Nicholas Gayer.

XoTT to see what Chelston wants. I
wish he had not selected this particular
time for beginning to worry me ; " and,
seizing the Baronet's epistle, he tore it
open with the air of a man determined toto
face the worst.

And behold, after all, there was nothing
so very terrible  only a crossed cheque,
with a good signature attached, which Sir
Geoffrey wanted his brother-in-law to cash.

For I have no banking account," he
explained ; " and if I took it to any of
the tradespeople I should perhaps be expected
to leave most part of the change
behind me."

Mr. Gayre pressed his bell.

Spicer," he said, " send in the person
who has been waiting for me, and tell
Hartley I want him."

Doubtful, perhaps, of the reception he
might meet with. Lavender hung beside
the door till the banker, with all his usual

affable frankness when addressing those
inferior to himself restored, bade him come
forward ; and while Hartley was absent
getting fifteen ten-pound notes, the precise
form Sir Geoffrey had requested the change
might take, asked how Miss Chelston was,
and remarked on the fineness of the weather,
and altogether relieved and satisfied the

man.

0, by-the-bye," said Mr. Gayre at last,
do you remember one day when you
were in the Eow seeing a gentleman's
horse shy at a stone roller ? It was a
hunter  bay, with black legs."

Yes, sir, well ; he was riding with Miss
Drummond. I don't know if you noticed
her horse  a very handsome animal too."

"It was the bay took my fancy," answered
Mr. Gayre. " Do you happen to
know the rider's name ? "

No, sir, I never saw him before ; but
he was a free-spoken sort of gentleman,

not long back from the Colonies, as he
gave me to understand, and, if I remember
right, he said he and Miss Susan had ridden
across from a place I think he called Enfield
Highway. I don't know if I am quite right
in the name."

There is an Enfield Highway," remarked
Mr. Gayre ; and then he put up the notes
in an envelope, which he handed to Lavender,
smiling to think hour far matters seemed
to have advanced in the course of a single
morning.

I'll see, my dear niece," he decided,
whether I cannot ascertain Miss Drummond's
address, which you say you have
forgotten."

ELIZA Gubbins.

jHEN Colonel Gayre decided to exchange
his sword for a pen, he
took up his residence in Brunswick Square
with old Mr. Gayre, who had long determined
not to remove from that central
and convenient locality till the time came
for him to be carried to the Gayre vault
in Highgate Cemetery.

The house was situated on the north, or
quietest, side of the square. Into fault
could be found with the number or size
of the rooms, the healthfulness of the situation,
or the general air of comfort pervading
the whole dwelling. Nevertheless, Mrs.
John Gayre and her husband both professed

themselves surprised at their father electing
to stop in a house where he had known
so much trouble. His wife and son both
died in it ; and there, also, he faced that
bitter sorrow concerning his daughter.

John urged the old man to make his
home with them, or, at least, to move
further westward, and " away from all the
sad memories which clustered around Brunswick
square ; '' but his parent asked in return,
"Where could I go that it would be
possible for me to forget ni} dead ? "

Those were the days ere it had become
a fixed belief of the Enohsh nation that
happiness and health are to be compassed
by eternal change of residence ; but yet
John Gayre felt it very unreasonable for
any one to refuse the delights of constant
clerical companionship and those intellectual
pleasures only to be found in the more
fashionable parts of London. He and his
wife became more exercised in their minds

than ever as to whether the sole-surviving
member of the Gayres meant to take a
certain "designing" manager into partnership.
Long previously Mrs. John had settled
future banking arrangements entirely
to her own satisfaction. Her brother was
to put in a certain amount of money ; and
then his son would marry dear Julia or
Fanny, and so " preserve " Gayres for the
family. John had been " pushed forward "
in the Church in a truly "miraculous manner,"
but his wife wished him to be pushed
forward a great deal more.

A most worldly and ambitious woman,
she was constantly trying to manage an old
gentleman who erred, perhaps, on the side
of fancying that all his life he had contrived
to manage exceedingly well for himself.
Mr. Gayre, however, utterly declined
to be managed. He got very tired, he
said, of general society, and, resisting all
attempts to induce him to change his abode.

he " shut himself up," to quote Mrs. John
Gayre's own words, "to question the justice
of the Almighty." But in this statement
she was quite wrong. Mr. Gayre was a
much truer Christian than his daughter-in-law
had ever been. He had lost, but he
did not sorrow as one who has no hope ;
disgrace had touched him, but he went
among his fellow-men and transacted his
business notwithstanding. As for other
matters, he still maintained his custom of
giving four formal dinner-parties each year ;
and if the guests who accepted his invitations
seemed to Mrs. John " dreadful people,"
they suited the banker a vast deal better
than the folks he met when seduced to an
at home " in Onslow-square.

They might not know much of Court
or the " dear Queen," or dukes and duchesses,
but some of them were acquainted
with Baring and Rothschild ; and if they
could not talk about the latest pieces of

fashionable scandal, they were aware how
stocks stood, and shook their heads mournfully
over Jones's huge failure, and told
how Smith had netted fifty thousand
at one transaction. Further, at his dinner-table
he delighted to see the clergyman
from the church situate in Eegent Square,
just at the back of his own house, and
any officer or civilian to whom Nicholas
asked him to show a little attention.

There was plenty to eat in Brunswick
Square, and of the best quality, Mr. Gayre's
spreads differing in this respect from the
Onslow Square parties, where, as once was
said, a fellow never got anything except
water ices and iced water."

Mrs. John Gayre had, indeed, reduced
gentility to a science. Her " social gatherings
" finally became so eminently genteel, no
one who could help it went to them twice.
Mr. Gayre had reason when he objected to
drive all that distance and stand "in a

crowd" with nobody he knew near him,
and get nothing in the way of food save a
morsel of sandwich and a wine-glassful of
claret-cup. Vhat he enjoyed, and what
really kept him in Brunswick Square, was
the companionship of a few old friends,
who liked their rubber and a bit of supper
to follow, and something hot and comfortable
in the way of punch as a genial
good-night ; all Hghts out by half-past
eleven, and the whole household warmly
asleep before twelve. Insomnia was not a
thing Mr. Gayre knew much about, and
he did not want to know about it.

The modern manner of living," he was
wont to declare, "brings all sorts of evil
in its train ;" a sentiment his friends in
Bedford and Russell Squares and Gower
and Guildford Streets were quite willing to
echo so long as old-fashioned customs presented
so pleasant an aspect as they did in
the hospitable banker's house.

Amongst the friends who for many a
long year after Mrs. Gayre's death had
helped to soothe the widower's loneliness by
taking a hand at a rubber was a certain
Mr. Jubbins, who, though not old in comparison
with most of the worthies wont to
assemble in the comfortable drawing-room,
was certainly by no means youthful. His
father had been a well-to-do oil-merchant
in a very large way of business ; and Mr.
Samuel Jubbins, devoting his attention to
the same line of money-making, contrived,
through some process, either chanced upon
by himself or devised by another person,
literally to turn oil into gold. Give him
the dirtiest, thickest-looking stuff imaginable,
and it came forth from his warehouse
clear and beautiful, a tiling to be admired,
an article to be paid for.

This wonderful process seemed also to
have produced a similar effect on Mr. Gubbins.
All the oil of his nature was good

and pleasant and genial. No better, or
honest, or kinder man ever cut for deal.
He was good to the poor swarming in the
courts off Gray's Inn Lane, and other neighbourhoods
adjacent to his house ; and he
bore the tyranny and the tantrums of an
elderly maiden sister, whose bitter tongue
was the terror of Bloomsbury, with a
patience which should have secured him
canonisation.

Amongst his many friends was a solicitor,
who lived in great style at a corner house in
Bedford Square, having offices in Bedford
Eow. This solicitor owned one child, a
daughter ; and Mr. Jubbins had dandled
this young lady when she was a baby, and
won her childish heart with presents of
fruit and cakes and confectionery. Her
name was Eliza Higgs ; and it may safely
be said, as a girl, no greater hoyden ever
existed.

When they were all little folks together,

Vol. i. u

she and the smaller Gayres were close
friends ; and on wet days they were wont
to play at battledore and shuttlecock in
the wide hall of the Bedford Square house,
and drive imaginary coaches and tandems
up and down stairs, to the distraction of
their elders.

Eliza Higgs was the youngest and worst
of the trio. She had a hard, well~filled-out,
good-natured, lively face ; wonderful brown
hair ; as stout and straight a pair of legs
as ever gladdened a parent's heart ; activity
which seemed simply inexhaustible ; and a
capacity for getting into mischief which
could only be regarded as miraculous.
She was in love with Nicholas Gayre, and
used to kiss him in a manner the boy resented
with many shoves and angry remonstrances
; but, on the whole, he liked Eliza
very much indeed, and preferred her companionship,
when any deed of daring was in
question, to that of his more timid sister.

When Nicholas Gayre returned home for
good he found the bouncing Eliza, Mrs.
Jubbins, and the mother of several tallow-faced
and delicate children. Mr. Higgs'
affairs had arrived at such a state of entanglement
that he tried to hang himself.
Being cut down just in time, Mr. Jubbins
stepped forward to the rescue, and proved
the splendid fellow everybody had always
thought him. He took the Higgs helm,
arranged with Higgs' creditors, found money
for the Higgs establishment ; and finally,
one Sunday morning, when he was escorting
Eliza back from St. Pancreas church, asked
her if she would marry him.

Had Miss Jubbins known she had kept

her brother single till he was fifty years

old, only in order that he might propose

for her god-daughter, she must have risen

from her grave ; but she did not know or

hear Miss Higgs' murmured "Yes."

The young lady had been warned by

112

her mamma that a proposal was imminent,
and told on no account to indulge in any
little affectations or pretences.

Our position is too serious, my dear, to
be trifled with," said the astute lady ; and
accordingly Eliza  who could not forget the
shock her papa had given them all, or the
mere thread which stood between her and
beggary, or, to do her justice, Mr. Jubbins'
kindness  gave her lover to understand she
would marry him with great pleasure.

When the happy man reached Bedford
Square, he had one of those kisses Nicholas
Gayre once received with such disfavour.

God bless you, dear," he said ; and
went away because he wanted to be alone
with his bliss.

That same afternoon, Mrs. Higgs, who
was an eminently practical person, with no
tendency to let the grass grow under her
feet, called on Mr. Gayre, and had a
long chat with that gentleman.

I left Lisa crying," she said, with a
cheerful countenance, after she had told
her good news, "and you'd never guess why."

"Perhaps," suggested the banker  who
thought the whole arrangement most sensible
and proper, and ' evincing a right feeling
'  " because he is nearly thirty years
older than herself."

dear, no," answered Mrs. Higgs ;
she does not mind that at all."

Had she any other lover ? "

"Not that she cared for."

"Was she fond of any one who was not
fond of her ? "

"Good gracious! what ar thinking of?
Certainly not, Mr. Gayre."

Then, as I have exhausted all my
guesses, will you tell me why your daughter
was crying when you left her ? "

Because her name would be Jubbins.
Higgs,' she said, ' was bad enough, but
only to think of Jubbins ! ' "

"Ah, those novels, those novels!" exclaimed
Mr. Gayre ; and then with a glad
heart, he offered Mrs. Higgs a glass of
wine, for the banker was a very kindly
man, and sincerely lamented the misfortunes
of his friends, when they did not
ask him for any money to tide them over
their troubles; and he thought reverses ina
certain rank of life were most lamentable,
and that if any one member of a
family could help the remainder to regain
their former position, it was the duty of
that individual to make even a great
sacrifice in order to avert the social scandal
of wealth being reduced to poverty.

In the matter of Eliza Higgs, as wife,
mother, and widow, she behaved precisely
With that admirable feeling and excellent
sense Mr. Gayre expected. She could
scarcely have been human, and failed to
prove grateful to the man who thought
her perfection, and deemed nothing in the

world money could purchase, or love think
of, too good for his young and handsome
wife.

Xo happier couple could have been found
in the whole of Bloomsbury, where Mrs.
Jubbins was pointed out as an example
to refractory misses, and a rebuke to
skittish matrons.

She learnt to play whist almost as well
as her husband, and Mr. Gayre often
crossed the square in order to play a
rubber, and spend a quiet evening in the
Jubbins house, which was ordered on the
same lines as found favour on the north
side.

Mr. Jubbins, making money a vast deal
more rapidly than Mr. Gayre, spent buta
small proportion of his income, and invested
the rest in good undertakings. He
looked up to the banker as his superior
in age, rank, and wealth, and Mr. Gayre
liked to be so looked up to; therefore the

intercourse between the two houses grew
closer and closer.

Things were in this state when Nicholas
Gayre commenced, under his father's tutelage,
to learn the knowledge and mystery
of banking ; and though he never associated
freely with, or took kindly to, the
Bloom bury connection, it was impossible
for him to avoid seeing a great deal of it.

"Where could you find kinder or more
excellent people ? " asked the old man, who
saw, or fancied he saw, a sign of the
cloven foot  the West-end mania  in his
son.

"All your friends, sir," answered Mr.
Gayre, jun., " do, indeed, appear to be
most kind and excellent persons." (sat
the same time," he added mentally, " it
is quite possible to see too much of
them")

He made no mention, however, of this
feeling to his father. Long habits of military

discipline, and sincere affection and
profound respect for a parent who had
always acted kindly and liberally towards
him, tied the ex-officer's tongue concerning
questions far more vexed and important than
the choice of acquaintances or the selection
of guests.

He did not abandon his own circle, but
he concealed the weary impatience he felt
of the Bloomsbury dinner-parties and social
evenings. The Israelites never could have
loathed the wholesome manna and the too
plentiful quails to the same extent that
Nicholas Gayre learned to hate whist and
port-wine and whitebait and lark-pudding
and City talk ; but in a most difficult position
he behaved himself remarkably welland
though his father's friends never, perhaps,
felt themselves quite at ease when he
was of the company, they liked to speak
about young Gayre, who, in spite of his
having " been at Balaclava, you know, and

all through the Mutiny, had given up this
profession and his brilliant prospects to please
his father, and was settling down in Lombard
Street as if he had been sitting behind a
desk all his life, like one of our own sons, sir."
Years had come and years had gone,
since the days when Nicholas and his sister
and Eliza Higgs romped through the large
house in Bedford Square ; but the first thing
Colonel Gayre thought of, when he saw Mrs.
Jubbins in the bosom of her family, was
concerning those sounding smacks she had
been in the habit of bestowing so lovingly
and lavishly upon him. He had forgotten
all about them and her, till his father piloted
him across Brunswick Square, and took him
up into the great drawing-room, the windows
of which almost faced those of Mr. Gayre's
own house, and said proudly, " I have
brought an old friend to see you, Mrs.
Jubbins. I do not suppose you remember
my son Nicholas."

Did she not, poor soul ? Had not a wandering
thought gone forth to him across the
seas even on her wedding-day?  though
Heaven knows there was not a taint of disloyalty
in her thought to the best husband
that ever lived.

I am so glad you have come back to us,
Colonel Gayre," was her greeting.

Then it all returned to him  the battledore
and shuttlecock, the mad galloping up
and down stairs, the surreptitious descents
to the kitchen, the visits to the housekeeper's
room, the kisses, the quarrels, the jam, the
scolding, the delights snatched with a fearful
joy and terror from under the very eyes
of Higgs pere. The change was so complete
and so absurd, Colonel Gayre felt the corners
of his mouth twitching under the shelter of
that friendly moustache, which had so often
protected his character for gravity ; but he
managed to say what he ought to have said,
and say it well. And then mr. Jubbins

appeared, and the visit passed off pleasantly ;
and the Jubbins' children, who were supposed
by a Bloomsbury fiction, to inherit the beauty
of their mother and the virtues of their
father, were introduced, and politics, as well
as more material fare, were discussed ; and
the head of the house hoped Colonel Gayre
would never feel a stranger in it.

Then once again the years went by, and
during the course of them Mr. Jubbins
waxed richer and richer, and Mrs. Jubbins
comelier, and the Gay res got a little poorer ;
and everything seemed going on in the same
monotonous groove much as usual, when
one day in the spring of 1865, Mr. Jubbins,
returning home from the City somewhat
earlier than usual, complained of having
caught a cold and not feeling very well.

Ever after he never felt very well, and
it was during the long and painful illness
which supervened, and eventually carried
him where there is no more pain and

no more sorrow (and Mr. Nicholas Gayre
hoped no more whist), that Mrs. Jubbins
won her golden spurs as a wife.

Nursing him she lost flesh and colour,
but never cheerfulness. To the last she
took a smile with her into the sick-room ;
and when Mr. Jubbins died, it was with
his poor wasted hand clasped tight in hers.

The best woman in the world ! " said
old Mr. Gayre enthusiastically, an opinion
his son did not feel inclined to controvert.

He considered Mrs. Jubbins' conduct towards
her husband unexceptionable ; and
if she failed to interest her old playfellow,
it was rather because of some deficiency
on his part than any shortcoming on hers.

After the death there ensued more thana
nine days' wonder. With the exception
of a very small sum secured to the children
and a few legacies of no great amount,
everything was left unconditionally to the
widow.

"Literally everything," said Mr. Gayre
senior, who was executor.

She'll have the whole City of London
asking her in marriage," thought Mr.
Nicholas ; but he did not say so.

He knew nothing vexed his father to
such an extent as any reflections on the
City ; therefore, if the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen and every member of the Corporation
had come courting to Brunswick
Square, he would have refrained his tongue
from comment.

But, as a matter of fact, nobody did anything
of the sort. Mrs. Jubbins afforded
the many admirers she no doubt possessed
small chance of declaring their sentiments.

For a year she lived in the strictest seclusion,
having Mrs. Higgs, now also a
widow, resident with her, seeing no one
except a few old and intimate friends, and
mourning most deeply and unaffectedly for
the husband whose loss, as she told Mr.

Gape, she felt more deeply day by
day.

This was all as it should be ; yet at the
end of a twelvemonth, mr. Gayre decided
there is a limit even to mourning and propriety,
and that it would be a serious loss
to the world if such a woman took her
grief to nurse for ever.

It is time she began to wean it," thought
the banker. This was after the great crash
of 1866, and his attention had been
directed even more than usual to the solid
advantages conferred by a large income.
She's the very wife for Nicholas, if he
can only be brought to think so. What
is there against the match ? Nothing.
What is there in favour of it ? Everything."
And indeed so many golden reasons
seemed to point to the Jubbins-Gayre
alliance as a most desirable one for both
parties that the banker decided some step
ought to be taken, unless Nicholas meant

to permit such a prize to slip through his
careless fingers.

So entirely at length did this idea take
possession of his mind that he determined
to broach the subject to " my son
Nicholas."

It was one Saturday morning, and senior
and junior were alone in the private room
at Gayres', when the old man, without any
leading up to the question, asked,

Do you never think of getting married,
Nicholas ? "

Well, no, sir," answered Nicholas ; " at
least, for a long time past I have not.
Once in a life, surely, is enough for a man
to make a fool of himself ; " which remark
had reference to a wild romantic passion
of the speaker's youth which had come to
a disastrous conclusion.

Ah, you must forget all that," said Mr.
Gayre. " I am sure you would be a great
deal happier married. All men should

marry, more particularly men who, like yourself,
have an old name to transmit, and an
old business to bequeath. I know nothing
which would give me such pleasure as to
see you united to a good wife. You have
been such a dutiful son, Nicholas, you deserve
to meet with a woman who could
give you more love even than your old
father has done."

There was a touch of deep feeling in
Mr. Gayre's voice as he spoke ; and as
Nicholas did not know very well what to
answer, he only said,

'thank you, sir."

And there is a woman," proceeded the
banker, "who, I am sure, would make you
happy, and I think would take you if you
asked her."

Indeed ! " exclaimed his son.

"Yes, Eliza Jubbins." The plunge was
made, and Mr. Gayre felt he could go on.
A most suitable match in every respect,

Vol. i. 12

Nicholas. She is a few years younger
than yourself. She is still a very handsome
woman ; you know how she acquitted
herself as a wife. You remember
what a daughter she was. She has 
but there, I won't mix money matters
up with the business. If she had not a
penny a year, she would still be a
treasure in herself. We know all about her
since the day she was born. No after-clap
can come in that quarter ; and I believe 
I do believe  she always felt a great regard
for you."

It would be idle to state that so astute
a man as Nicholas had not known for sometime
previously whither his father's desires
were drifting. Nevertheless, this plain intimation
of what Gayres expected from
him in the way of a fresh sacrifice came
with the force of a blow.

Marry Eliza Jubbins !  become stepfather
to the young Jubbinses !  son-in-law to clever,

manoeuvring Mrs. Higgs ! Settle down for
the term of his natural life among the
Bloomsbury connection  go voluntarily into
the penal servitude of eating, drinking,
sleeping, thinking, visiting, with a class he
knew he could never really care for, seemed
to this man too dreadful a doom to hear
mentioned by another.

Nevertheless, he did not say " No." Long
experience of his father had taught him
the wisest policy in all family games was
to play not trumps, but the most insignificant
and inoffensive card he could find in
his hand.

One of those he threw out now.

It is early days to talk of anything
of that sort," he objected. " She has not
been a widow much more than a year,
and her tears are not dry yet."

Dry them yourself, my boy, then," recommended
Mr. Gayre, with a chuckle of
delight at finding Nicholas took his sug-

12-2

gestion so coolly. " There is no time for
winning a woman equal to that while her
eyes are still wet. Besides, I feel sure
she has a fondness for you. I am old, but
I can see ; bless you, I have not lived all
these years with my eyes shut."

That I am certain you have not, sir,"
replied Nicholas, in a tone in which respect
and a pleasant flattery were dexterously
blended. "Yet I must confess it
seems to me premature to discuss such a
matter."

Not in the least  not in the least.
Jubbins has been dead over a twelvemonth."
said the banker, practically " going into
figures."

"Still  to say nothing of my own objections
 I do not think Mrs. Jubbins would
feel grateful if she knew we were already
disposing of her in marriage."

There may be something in what you
remark," agreed Mr. Gayre. " Spite of

her excellent sense, Eliza was always a little
given to sentimentality. We'll speak no
more about the affair, then, for the present ;
only, Nicholas, you will promise me to
think about it."

Yes, I will do that, on the condition
that no word is dropped to Mrs. Jubbins.
I must feel myself quite free ; for, to be
quite plain, I do not believe I shall ever
marry."

"That is simply nonsense, my son.
You owe something to your family. You
are almost the last of the Gayres. John
has no sons ; we have not even a distant
relation of our own name. If you do not
marry, and have children, who is to carry
on the business ? "

Mr. Nicholas made no reply to a question
his father evidently considered crushing"
; but he thought two things  one, that
the future might safely be left to look
after its own affairs ; and another, that if

things went on in Lombard Street as they
were going, at the end of another thirty
years they would be no business called
Gayres' to carry on.

WILL HE PROPOSE?

'T was to the house in Brunswick
Square, which had for years been
tenanted by the Jubbins', that Mr. Gayre
repaired on the afternoon following his
visit to .Chislehurst. Opinion in Bloomsbury
was divided as to whether the banker
had proposed to the widow and been
rejected, or was still making up his mind
to put the momentous question.

Concerning the first alternative, Mrs.
Jubbins could have enlightened her friends ;
but with regard to the second it was impossible
for her to say, even mentally,
aught save "I hope and I fear." There
were days when she hoped, and there were

days when she feared ; yet as months and
years gilded away, she grew very sick with
hope deferred." She believed the man,
the only man she had ever truly loved with
the one love of a woman's heart, would
some day ask her to be his wife ; nevertheless,
she did not quite understand him;
surely that wound, which had changed the
frank, brilliant, charming youth into a still
more interesting, if less comprehensible,
man, ought to have been healed long
ago ?

Mrs. Jubbins had some reason for believing
he meant to marry her. Old Mr. Gayre,
keeping to the letter of his promise, if not
to the spirit, confided to Mrs. Higgs that
my son Nicholas was thinking seriously
of her daughter, and he, Mr. Gayre, should
feel glad if the young man proposed, and
Mrs. Jubbins accepted him." To Mrs.
Higgs, the idea of her daughter wedding
into the Gayres seemed a thing almost too

good to realise, and in her exultation at
the suggestion she forgot to maintain that
reserve Mr. Gayre had stipulated on. So
Eliza was given to understand Nicholas
had intimated he meant to " think of her : "
and Nicholas, like his father, fulfilling the
mere letter of his promise, did for a whole
year think of his old playfellow with an
ever-increasing dislike towards the connection.
He did not want directly to cross
his parent's wishes, but he felt to make
Eliza Jubbins his wife would be to settle
his own future in an utterly distasteful
manner.

He liked the lady well enough  but
liking is not love  and though he knew
her money would be of use, both to
himself and the bank, those thousands,
made out of oil, repelled rather than attracted
him. Then there were the juvenile
Jubbins  commonplace in mind and features,
spoiled, delicate, antagonistic, to his perhaps

over-fastidious taste. Though the
Bloomsbury world, or that other world quite
away from Bloomsbury, with which he
still kept up a friendly intercourse, did
not suspect the fact, he had long outlived
the old attachment Mrs. Higgs and her
daughter often talked about with bated
breath.

He was single, not from any actual
objection to the married state, or fancy
for one especial fair, but simply because
no woman calculated greatly to delight so
stern and cynical a judge of the sex had
crossed his path. Possibly he was looking
for perfection. If so, he had certainly as
yet not found it. Upon the other hand,
seeing that mediocrity and common-place
virtues are often supposed to form a very
good embodiment of a higher ideal, it
seemed really hard he could not please his
father and delight Mrs. Higgs, and return
Mrs. Jubbins' attachment and reward her

constancy ; but all this appeared to Mr.
Gayre impossible. The more he thought
the matter over, the longer he contemplated
himself hedged in by City notions, surrounded
by a mere moneyed cheque, tied
to the apron-strings of Bloomsbury gentility
 travelling life's road in company
with the men he had to meet in business,
and acting the part of a model stepfather
to the Jubbins' brood  the more truly he
felt that, putting all question of romance,
or love, or the glamour which does encircle
some women, totally aside, such a marriage
was, for him, out of the question.

At the end of a year from the time his
father first broached the subject he was
still " thinking the matter over ; " after
which period all necessity for him to think
about it ceased  his father died.

For six months after that event, Mr.
Nicholas Gayre, a wanderer here and there,
debated what he should do with his life ;

then all in a hurry he made up his mind ;
sold the lease of the Brunswick Square
house, took another in Upper Wimpole
Street, removed the furniture, books, plate,
and china left to him under his father's
will, and, with the help of three old servants,
soon found himself much more at
home than had ever been the case since
he left the army and took to banking.

It was about this time Mrs. Jubbins'
hopes revived. During the period when,
according to his father's desire, he had
been thinking of the widow as his future
wife, Mr. Nicholas Gayre's manners became
quite unconsciously cold and distant to
the constant Eliza. Now no longer bound
by his father's old-world notions ; free from
the Bloomsbury servitude, wherein he had
duly fulfilled his term ; free to think and
talk of other things besides money, and
stocks, and investments, and commercial
imprudence, and mercantile success ; free.

further, to marry whom he chose, or no
one at all, Mr. Gayre grew quite amiable,
and fell easily back into the familiar, though
not close, intimacy which had marked his
intercourse with the Jubbins family after
his return from soldiering.

As a matter of course, the good-looking
Eliza took it for granted he would step
into his father's place as adviser-inches
concerning the Jubbins property.

The title-deeds, the scrip of all sorts,
the  shares, the trade secrets, were under
lock and key in Gayres' strong-room. At
Gayres' Mrs. Jubbins continued the account
her husband formerly kept there. Had he
felt curious about the matter, Mr. Nicholas
Gayre might have ascertained almost to a
penny what she spent, and how she spent
it. There was nothing which pleased the
lady so much as getting into a muddle,
and being compelled to ask Mr. Gayre to
help her out of it.

She made mountains of mole-hills in order
to write notes to him, and, herself a most
excellent manager and capital Avoman of
business, tried to pass for one of the most
incompetent of her sex. Mrs. Higgs died,
and then, of course, Mrs. Jubbins needed
advice more than ever. Two of her young
people, spite of money and doctors and
care, and everything which could be thought
of to restore them to health, drooped and
died. All these events retarded Mr. Gayre's
proposal, no doubt ; still, there were times
when Mrs. Jubbins doubted whether he
ever meant to propose. Had she known
as much of the world as Nicholas, she
would have understood friendliness is the
worst possible symptom where a man's
heart is concerned. Mr. Gayre had as
much intention of proposing for one of
the princesses as for the widow. Preposterous
as the idea seemed in his father's
life-time, it seemed trebly preposterous now.

He did not exactly know what lie expected,
though indeed he guessed ; but he had
long before made up his own mind that,
so far as he was concerned, Mrs. Jubbins
should remain sirs. Jubbins till the end
of the chapter.

A longer interval than usual had elapsed
without his seeing her, when he turned his
steps in the direction of Brunswick Square.
As he approached the familiar door Mr.
Grayre surveyed Mrs. Jubbins' residence with
an amount of interest and curiosity he had
never before experienced, and he certainly
felt a sensation of pleasure at the sight of
windows clear as whiting and chamois and
that other commodity, better than either,
vulgarly called "elbow-grease," could make
them, enamelled boxes filled with flowers
on the sills, curtains white as the driven
snow and of the best quality money could
buy, spotless steps, polished knocker, and
all those little et-ceteras which point to

money, good servants, and a capable
mistress.

"It is not Onslow Square, certainly,"
thought Mr. Gayre, " but we will see what
we can do with it."

Now, this is really kind of you ! "
exclaimed Mrs. Jubbins  a handsome and
well-preserved woman on the right side of
forty  stretching out a white plump hand
in greeting. "You see, I am still unable to
move," she added, with a laugh which
showed an exceedingly good set of teeth,
pointing as she spoke to a stool over which
a couvre-pieds was thrown, in the modeste
manner possible. "Why, it is quite an age
since you have been here !"

"Yes, indeed," he answered, in his suave
decisive manner  " almost three months.
I fear you have been suffering much
anxiety. Why did you not send for me
sooner ? "

Well," she began to explain  " well  "

Then, after a pause, " I know you must
have so many engagements."

None," he answered, ' believe me, that
could ever keep me absent if you said
you needed my poor services."

Mrs. Jubbins had been a bold child, but
she was not a forward woman. Quite the
contrary. Supposing she could have won
Mr. Gayre by saying, " Will you marry
me ?" he must have remained union forever,
and for this reason she did not take
advantage of his pretty speech, but merely
inclined her sleek head in acknowledgment,
as she asked,

"Have you been able to go to Chislehurst?"


"Yes," he said. "And The Warren is a
most lovely place."

Which you would advise me to take ?"

If you really wish to go out of town
for the summer, certainly."

Tell me all about it, please ;" and the

Jubbins relict leaned back on the sofa,
crossed her hands, and closed her eyes.

She was worth  heavens, ladies, how
much was she not worth ?  and could
consequently, even in the concentrated
presence of Gayre, Delone, Eyles, and Co.,
lean back, cross her hands, and close her
eyes to any extent she liked.

Mr. Gayre looked at her not without approval
 looked at her comely face, her
broad capable forehead, her straight well-defined
brows, her wealth of hair  not
combed over frizettes, a fashion then still
much in favour, but taken straight off her
face to the back of a shapely, if somewhat
large head, and there wound round and
round in great plaits almost too thick and
long even for the eye of faith.

Such hair  such splendid hair  as Mrs.
Jubbins possessed, quite of her own and
altogether without purchase, belongs to
few women.

Mr. Gayre knew it to be perfectly
natural. He had been well acquainted
with it in his youth, and in his experienced
middle age he could have detected a single
false lock ; but there was nothing false
about Mrs. Jubbins. All she had was as
genuine as her money, as the Spanish
mahogany furniture which had belonged to
her husband's grandfather.

The Warren," proceeded Mr. Gayre, " is
simply charming. A cottage in a wood ;
but such a cottage, and such a wood!
Lord Flint, it seems, bought about twenty
acres covered with trees, cleared a space
on the top of the hill, and built a summer
residence for his bride. Shortly afterwards
he succeeded to the earldom ; but still
spent some portion of each year at the
cottage, laying money out freely on the
house and grounds. He died last summer ;
and as the widow does not now like the
place  whether she liked it when her

13-2

husband was living, I cannot say  she
wants to let it ; so there the house, fully
furnished, stands empty for you to walk
into, if you like."

At the mention of a lord, Mrs. Jubbins,
who dearly loved nobility, old or new,
opened her eyes and assumed an upright
attitude.

A place of that sort would be too
grand and fine for me," she objected, in the
tone of one who wished to be contradicted.

"It is not at all grand," answered Mr.
Gayre, " and the furniture is not fine. I
daresay it cost a considerable sum of
money ; but really everything looks as
simple and homely as possible." And then
he went on to talk of the gardens, and
grounds, and terraces, and woods, finishing
by remarking, " Though quite close to
London, one might be a hundred miles
away from town, the air is so pure and
the silence so utter."

For a few moments Mrs. Jubbins made
no reply. Then she said, with a delighted
little laugh,

Only fancy me having in the house of
a real lord  not a lord mayor, but a
peer !"

It is a very nice house for any one
to live in," observed ]mr. Gayre, wondering,
if she rented the residence, how often in
the course of a month she would mention
Lord Font, and the Earl of Merioneth,
and her ladyship the Countess.

"Who would believe it!" exclaimed sirs.
Jubbins. "And yet, do you know, I think
I must have been dreaming of something
of this sort. I have had the strangest
thoughts lately. Whether it is this lovely
weather following the long dreary winter,
or being kept a prisoner by my ankle, or
what, I am sure I cannot tell ; but often
of late I have found myself wondering
whether I was doing right in staying so

much at home, and spending so little
money, and making no new acquaintances,
and continuing the same round from year's
end to year's end, as though Brunswick
Square were the world, and no other place
on the face of the earth existed except
Bloomsbury."

Mr. Gayre smiled, and hazarded the remark
that neither of them ought to
speak against Bloomsbury.

"No, that is quite true," agreed the
lady ; " but yet, you see, you have gone
west, and everybody else seems going
west, or buying places out of town,
except myself. The Browns have taken
a house in Dorchester Terrace, the Jones
have gone to Bournemouth."

"And the Eobinsons no doubt will follow
suit," suggested Mr. Gayre, forgetful
that Mrs. Jubbins' circle of friends did
include a family of that name.

"Yes, Mr. Robinson is building himself

quite a mansion down at ,
and they expect to be able to
move in August. I tell her she won't
like it  that there is no place on the
Thames to equal London ; but they all
seem eager to go ; after a time there will
be nobody left in Bloomsbury but me ; "
and Mrs, Jubbins sighed plaintively.

"You will not be left if you take the
Warren," said Mr. Gayre.

"I can't stay at The Warren for ever,"
she answered ; "I shall have to come back
here some day, unless  "

"Unless what?" asked Mr. Gayre.

Unless I sell the lease of this house,
and remove altogether. I really think 1
ought to make some change. The children
are growing up, and ought to be in a
neighbourhood where they could form
pleasant acquaintances. Bloomsbury is all
well enough for elderly persons ; and the
tradespeople are very good ; I don't think

you could get better meat anywhere than
Grist supplies ; and though Ida is not
strong, I fancy that is only natural
delicacy, and has nothing to do with the
air. But still"

If I were you," interrupted Mr. Gayre,
who always waxed impatient under details
that had seemed both instructive and
agreeable to his father, " I should take
this Chislehurst place for a year ; at the
end of that time you could decide
whether it would be best to return here,
or remain on there, or buy a house at
the West End. What lovely flowers ! How
they transform this dear old room ! It
looks quite gay and bright  ."

They make a dreadful litter," remarked
Mrs. Jubbins, who was a very Martha in
household details, though to hear her talk
at times any one might have supposed
Mrs. Hemans took a healthy and lively
view of life in comparison with the

buxom Eliza  " but they certainly do light
up a house. The day before I sprained
my ankle I went over to Dorchester Terrace,
and, dear me, I thought what a
difference between the West End and
Bloomsbury ! When I came back our
square seemed quite dingy ; so I told
Hopkins to arrange with some nurseryman
to keep me supplied with plants. At first
it did seem a dreadful waste of money,
and I could not help wondering what
your poor father would have said to such
extravagance ; but there, the world goes
on, and one can't stand still and be left
all behind, can one ? "

Gracious Heavens ! " considered Mr.
Gayre, " if I had married her I should
have been compelled to listen to this
sort of thing all the days of my life ; "
then he said aloud, " Talking of my father,
I want you to grant me a favour ; will
you?'

Certainly ; need you ask ? What is
it ? " And then Mrs. Jubbins paused abruptly,
as the notion occurred to her
that perhaps the long-deferred hour was
at last on the point of striking.

But Mr. Gayre's next words dispelled
the illusion.

You remember Margaret ? "

Hot and swift the tell-tale blood rushed
up into Mrs. Jubbins' face, and as she
said, " Yes, is she in London ? " a duller,
but not less painful, colour mantled Mr.
Gayre's brow.

"I do not suppose Margaret will ever
come to London," he answered ; " but her
daughter is here, and I should consider
it a great kindness if you would pay the
girl a little attention. You lnow  or possibly
you do not know  what a miserable,
hopeless, irreclaimable sinner the father is.
His own relations have cut him adrift :
mine will have nothing to do with him ;

consequently, through no fault of her own,
my niece is, by both sides of the house, .
left out in the cold. I should like her
to be intimate with a good sensible woman
such as you are ; but perhaps I am 
too much."

"Too much! I shall be enchanted todo
anything in my power for Margaret's
daughter. Is she like her mother, poor
dear Margaret ? "

"My sister was pretty," answered Mr.
Gayre, with a feeling of deep gratitude
swelling in his heart for the friendly
warmth of Mrs. Jubbins' manner. " My
niece is beautiful. Her face does not
seem so sweet to me as Margaret's ; but
most persons would admire it far more.
She is, in fact, so beautiful, so lovely,
and placed in such a painful and exceptional
position, that I shall not know
a moment's peace till she is suitably
married."

Dear, dear ! " exclaimed Mrs. Jubbins ;
I would go to her this moment if it
were not for this tiresome ankle. Could
she not come to me, though, Mr. Gayre?
I am such an old friend of your family,
she might dispense with ceremony, and let
us make acquaintance at once. If she
spent a few days here, for instance, and
then supposing I were to take Lady Merits
house, that would make a little
change for her."

You are the kindest person in the
world," said Mr. Gayre, with conviction.

No, indeed I am not ; only think,
you know, if it were one of my own
daughters. I am sure I quite long to seethe
dear girl. Wliat a thing for poor
Margaret to be parted from her only
chid ! "

"My niece believes her mother is dead,
and there seems to me no necessity to
enlighten her."

Ah ! that makes it all the worse.
When I remember  when I look back,
and recall her lovely face framed in those
sunny curls  "

"Looking back is worse than useless,"
interrupted Mr. Gayre, speaking hoarsely.
We cannot undo the past ; the best
plan is to act as prudently as possible in
the present. That is why I ask your
help  why I want you to look a little
after the child of my unhappy sister."

"And that I will," declared Mrs. Gubbins,
heartily, " It will be like having a
daughter given to me in the place of
my darling Clara ; a daughter to think
and plan for and love. How I long to
see her ! When do you think she can
come here ? Will you bring her?  or
shall I send a fly and Hopkins? You
know he really is a most superior and
respectable person."

This time Mr. Gayre forgot to smile

at Mrs. Jubbins' singular way of putting
things.

I will arrange the visit with my niece,"
he said, " and give you due notice when
you may expect to see us. I am a bad
hand at returning thanks; but I feel your
kindness more than I can express."

It is nothing," she answered vehemently,
nothing at all ; it is I who am obliged. All
my life I have been receiving favours from
your family, and doing nothing in return.
You have made me so very happy. I wonder
if you would mind my consulting you concerning
another little matter I could not
avoid thinking about while tied to this
sofa?"

"I am all attention," Mr. Gayre declared.
What is this matter ? Are you thinking of
setting up a carriage ? "

"Well, you must be a wizard!" exclaimed
Mrs. Jubbins. " Do you know, often lately
I have been wondering whether my poor

husband and your dear father would think
a single brougham and a very plain livery
too great an extravagance. You see things
have changed so much during the course
of the last few years. There was a time
when all one's friends lived close at hand;
but now one must have a fly to pay visits ;
and really a carriage and coachman of one's
own would not cost so very much more."

"My dear Mrs. Jubbins," said Mr. Gayre,
"you talk as if you had to economise upon
five hundred a year instead of being obliged
to starve on fifteen thousand."

Yes," she answered ; " but there are the
children, and I do so want to be a faithful
steward, Mr. Gayre, and justify the trust reposed
in me. Yet there are two sides to the
question, I am sure. Our fathers moved with
their times, and, as a mother, I ought to move
with mine ; and that brings me to what I
wished to say  not about the carriage, it can
wait ; but  '.'

Yes ? " said Mr. Gayre, interrogatively.
"You must promise not to laugh at

me."

I am very sure I shall not laugh at what
you say."

"Well, then I have been thinking most
seriously whether, if I take a house out of
town  and the doctor says I must  it would
not be a good opportunity for changing my

name."

/ leg your pardon ! "

No italics could indicate the astonishment
expressed in Mr. Gayre's tone.

Are you thinking of marrying again ? "
he went on  severely, as the widow imagined,
but really in a mere maze of bewilderment.

"No  no," she said, hurriedly. "It is
not likely I shall ever marry again -I am
certain I never shall ; but I cannot blind
myself to the fact that the name of Jubbins
is in many ways a bar socially. Put it to
yourself, Mr. Gayre  Jubbins ! Awful ! All

the years I have borne it have never reconciled
me to the name. Higgs was not beautiful,
but Jubbins is worse."

' A rose by any other name would smell
as sweet,' " quoted Mr. Gayre, resolutely refraining
even from smiling.

"Not if it was called Jubbins," answered
the lady almost tearfully.

Yes, it would," persisted the banker ;
but whether or no, there are for the present,
at all events, good and sufficient reasons
why your late husband's known and honest
name should be preserved. As you are
aware, the formulae for making those wonderful
oils lie at our bank. When your sons
come of age they will want to make use of
them. The name is associated with the product.
It is of pecuniary value. The De
Yere Oil, for example, would not command
any market. I have always admired many
traits in your character, but none more than
your excellent feeling. Give that fair play

Vol. i. 14

now. Just think what the name you bear
has done for you."

I know  I know."

And do consider that, although you have
an undoubted right at any moment to change
your own name by marriage, you really have
no right to change the name of jour children."


Mr. Gayre, how good and clever you
are ! How clear you make everything ! "

"And speaking for myself," added the
banker, warming to the subject, " I can only
say that, though I liked ]\Iiss Higgs much,
I like Mrs. Jubbins more."

You are kind ! " exclaimed the widow,
while the colour once more fluttered in her
face, and, spite of her declaration that she
would never marry again, she began to consider
such an event not quite impossible.
What, must you go ? Well, you have given
me a great deal of your valuable time, and I
am very grateful to you."

She could not rise on account of that
troublesome ankle, and, as Mr. Gay re held
her hand while he spoke some words of
thanks, he was obliged to stoop a little, and
unconsciously perhaps  fell into an almost
tender attitude.

Mrs. Jubbins' heart beat so fast and so
loud, she felt afraid he would hear it. The
long-expected declaration must surely be
hovering on his lips !

That was a supreme moment. Never
before had he retained her hand so long ;
on the contrary, he had ever previously held
it as short a time as possible. Never had he
before regarded her with a look of such admiration;
never had his lone been so low,
or his words so earnest, or 

Just then a tremendous double knock  prolonged,
ear-splitting, infuriating  resounded
through the house. Was ever knock before
so unexpected and so loud ? Mrs. Jubbins
gave a start, which almost threw her oH" the

142

sofa. Mr. Gayre dropped her hand as if he
had been shot.

And, after all, it was no one coming up ;
only Mrs. Robinson's card, and kind inquiries
after dear Mrs. Jubbins' ankle. Mr. Gayre
saw that card lying on a salver as he passed
out, excellently contented with his afternoon's
work, but, upon the whole, not quite so well
satisfied with himself.

FATHER, DAUGHTER, Uncle.

your Father at home, Margaret ? "
It was Mr. Gayre who asked this
question. He had gone straight from Brunswick
Square to North Bank, debating that
matter of his own conduct all the way.

When he left the City he fully intended
to have " a few words " with his niece ; but
he did not feel his own hands quite clean
enough at the minute to cast stones at her,
and accordingly would have deferred the
operation till a more convenient season but
for the action taken by the young lady
herself.

Yes ; papa has not gone out yet," she
said, in answer to his inquiry. " I will tell

him you are here ;" and she left the room,
but, changing her mind, returned almost immediately,
and, closing the door, observed,
with a confusion which for once was not
feigned,

I want to say something to you, uncle."

Say on then, my niece," he returned.

But she hesitated, looking at him piteously
for help, till at last he felt compelled to ask,

"Well, what is it?"

Can't you guess ? "

Whether I can or not, I decline to do
anything of the sort. Come, say what you
have got to say, and let us be done with
the matter."

"It is  about  Susan Drummond."

"Yes; what about her?"

For one moment Miss Chelston doubted
whether he remembered, and lamented her
own folly in not letting a sleeping dog lie ;
but the next she felt sure he could not
have forgotten, and said.

"You must have thought it so odd that
I did not tell papa I had seen her."

Did I ? Xo, I do not think I did. 1
'yonder now why you told him such an
untruth ; but I presume you had some
reason, good or bad, for not wishing him
to know."

"I was wrong," she confessed, in a tone
of the deepest humility ; " but indeed I
acted from the very best motives."

It would be interesting to know what
those motives were ; but I suppose you
won't tell me."

yes, indeed  indeed I will ; I have
been longing to tell you. Susan and I are
the oldest and dearest of friends  I may
say  she is the only friend I have ni all
the wide world. I understand her perfectly :
and the reason I did not want papa to suspect
she was in London  "

Out with it," advised Mr. Gayre.

"Well, you see, at the time I thought

things would be different here. Papa told
me we should have a great deal of company,
and that I would be asked out to
parties and  and  all that sort of thing;
and I knew, since her uncle's death, poor
dear Susan could not afford to dress  as 
as people have to dress if they go into
society ; and I thought asking her to come
to us would only vex and place her in a
false position."

"Anything else?" suggested Mr. Gayre.

Yes ; but you must not be vexed with
me. I do hate riding, and I was sure papa
would be wanting me to go out with Susan;
and I dare not  0, I dare not ! That
horse you so much admired almost frightened
me to death."

"You are quite sure you have nothing
more to tell me ? " said Mr. Gayre, as she
came to a full stop.

Quite sure  quite sure, indeed."

Mr. Gayre looked her over with an

amused smile. She did not lift her eyes to
his, but stood With them cast penitently
downwards, waiting for any comments he
might have to make.

I think," he began at last, " there is
some truth in what you have just been
saying, but I fancy there is not much.
Now let me give you a little advice. Don't
try to hoodwink me. In the first place,
it is a mere waste of time ; and in the
second, you will find it to your advantage
to work with, instead of against, me. All
I desire is your good. You are placed
in a most difficult and exceptional position,
and you have not so many friends you
can afford to quarrel with any of them,
more especially a girl like Miss Drummond."


"Quarrel, uncle! I wouldn't quarrel with
Susan for all the world ; but how could
I know living in London would turn out
so different from what I expected  so

miserable ? " ended Miss Chelston, with a
gasping sob.

"You expected, perhaps, to be presented
at Court?" hinted Mr. Gayre, with
bitter irony.

"I did not think it was at all impossible,"
she answered.

"And what do you think now?" he
asked.

That I have been very silly ; and 0,
it's all such a dreadful disappointment ! "
and, covering her face with her hands,
she left the room fairly in tears.

"It is hard on the girl," thought Mr.
Gayre, " and why should I have expected
straightforwardness from her ? The father
does not know the meaning of the word ;
the mother was a poor weak timid fool ;
and I  well, my friend, I don't consider
you have much reason to be proud of
yourself."

So you have sent Peggy off crying,"

said the Baronet cheerfully, opening the
door at this juncture; "I am very glad
of it. Hope you gave her a good scolding.
As I told her yesterday  for I had
an appointment after I got back from
Enfield the other day, and was not home
till long after she had gone to bed  as
I told her, there is nothing in the world
I detest like a falsehood. Let a man ora
woman only speak the truth, and I
do not much care how bad he or she
may be in other respects, though no one
who does speak the truth can be very
bad."

"I think we may let the affair rest
now," remarked Mr. Gayre. "More particularly
as Miss Drummond ought never
to know Margaret's silence was other
than a piece of carelessness. It will bea
great matter for your daughter to have
so nice a friend staying with her. Have
you settled when she is to come ? "

Yes. Peg wrote her as pretty a note
yesterday as you'd wish to read. 0, she
was humble enough, 1 can tell you. It's
not often I do come the stern parent
business, but I did speak out. I said,
If you think because Susan has only
got a poor couple of thousand pounds
she is not as welcome to my house as
though she had millions, you are very
much mistaken, that's all. I'm sorely afraid,
Peggy," I went on, " you're an arrant
little snob ; and you don't inherit that
failing from me any more than your want
of candour. No one can say I ever held
myself aloof from any man because he
was not rich or well-born. What's the
use of being well-born if one can't shake
hands with a beggar ? No, that girl of
mine wants taking down. She does think
so confoundedly much of herself."

It seems to me she has been taken
down a great deal," observed Mr. Gayre.

She evidently came to London expecting
to carry all before her ; and, spite of
your agreeable manners and large circle
of desirable acquaintances, she finds herself
alone in a great city, without a soul
to speak to. However," added Mr. Gayre
hurriedly, to prevent his brother-in-law
once again taking up his parable, " I
have at last succeeded in getting her one
invitation, which I hope will lead to more.
As we can't induce rank to notice her,
I determined to try money. Mrs. Jubbins
of Brunswick Square, a lady I have known
all my life, will be delighted to do anything
and everything she can for Margaret."

Come, that's encouraging," exclaimed
the Baronet, "though Jubbins does not
exactly seem a name one would find in
Burke, and Brunswick Square is a little
eh?"

If you mean that it is not Belgravia,.
you are right ! but as no duchess has

rushed forward to chaperone your daughter,
it may be prudent to try and make the
best of rich respectability."

Why, my dear fellow, how you talk !
Any one, to hear the way you go on,
might imagine I was particular ! Thank
God, I am no such thing ! I do not
worship rank or money. And so your
friends are very rich. What is the husband?"


I don't know what he may be at
present ; he is dead ; he was a most excellent
person when living."

Widow ! Bless me, why don't you
make up to her, Gayre ? "

"Well, there are several reasons. One,
however, may seem sufficient. She says
she is not going to marry again."

Pooh ! " commented Sir Geoffrey, with
an airy incredulity.

At all events, she has let seven years
pass without making a second choice."

The right man has not asked her,"
remarked the Baronet, with decision ; and
he shook his head with such emphasis
that Mr. Gayre knew he was thinking if
his wife " gave him a chance," and the
fortune proved sufficient, he himself woukl
attempt Mrs. Jubbins' conversion, and with
brilliant success.

She is a truly admirable woman in
every relation of life," said Mr. Gayre.

"I am thankful to hear it  most
thankful," answered Sir Geoffrey, solemnly.
What a fortunate fellow you are, Gayre,
not to be saddled with the responsibility
of a daughter! I declare the future of
mine is getting to be a nightmare to me.
What on earth would become of poor
Peggy if I died?"

It is extremely difficult to say,"
observed Mr. Gayre, too wise to be
entrapped into any promise by his simple
brother-in-law.

And we must all die," pursued the
Baronet, tentatively.

So it is said ; but there is no rule
without an exception, and you may prove
that exception."

Sir Geoffrey digested this remark, and,
deciding he would not make much out of
Mr. Gayre on such a tack, said, in a frank
sort of manner, as if the idea had only just
occurred to him,

"I really don't know that I should object
to a City man as a husband for my girl if
he could insure her a proper establishment."

It is extremely good and wise of you
to say so."

You see I can give her no fortune."

And, as a rule, money expects money
nowadays."

"Upon the other hand," proceeded Sir
Geoffrey, " she is my daughter."

So she is ; that is a great advantage,"
said Mr. Gayre.

For a moment it occurred to the Baronet
that his brother-in-law was openly gibing at
him ; but looking sharply up, he could see
no hint of laughter in the calm, cold face.

"And a title must always carry a certain
weight," he ventured.

"But your daughter has no title, and as
for yours  knights and baronets have in
the City become somewhat of drugs in the
market. What can Margaret, without a
penny of dowry, do for any man ? You
have no property left for him to talk
about. Your daughter has no social standing
; she possesses the manners of a gentlewoman,
I admit, and is extremely good-looking.
Nevertheless  "

For Heaven's sake, Gayre, don't make
me more wretched than I am ! It was my
misfortune, not my fault, I did not marry
into my own rank of life, in which case
my relations must have seen to the girl.
But as matters stand  "

Vol. i. 15

I think, Sir Geoffrey, I will wish you
good afternoon,' " interposed Mr. Ga3n:-e,
rising in hot wrath, and striding across the
small room to the door, with the almost
forgotten military gait.

But ere he reached it, Sir Geoffrey caught
him.

My dear, dear Gayre  " he began : and
then, as his dear Gayre wrenched himself
from his detaining grasp, and reached the
hall, the Baronet, once again seizing his
sleeve, went on, " You have misunderstood
me, quite."

Mr. Gayre, however, was not so easily toto
be appeased. Standing in the middle of
the gravelled path, sheltered from the
vulgar gaze by that high wall already
mentioned, he delivered his parable. He
rehearsed the righteous doings of the
Gayres, and the sins of Sir Geoffrey.

Good God ! " he cried, and certainly,
as a rule, Mr. Gayre was no profane

swearer, " if my father had Hkecl he could
have given you seven years' penal servitude
over that matter of my sister's settlement.
But he refrained ; and yet now you
talk as if you had made a mesalliance by
entering a family able to trace a longer
pedigree than your own."

Through a little pantry-window, almost
screened from the sight of visitors by a
goodly arbor vice. Lavender watched the
progress of this wordy war, saw Mr. Gayre's
impatient and angry movement, and his
master's deprecating gestures, and the
humble and almost cringing servility of
his manner.

Sir Geoffrey's gone and done it now,"
he considered. " Ah ! I knew it was too
good to last. He'll be off in a minute
more, and I suppose we'll never set eyes
on him here again."

And indeed departure seemed imminent.
Mr. Gayre had his hand on the lock of

152

the gate, and, spite of Sir Geoffrey's efforts
to detain him, was evidently bent on
making his way into the road ; but just
as he had turned the handle, and was on
the eve of leaving Mr. Moreby's borrowed
villa for ever, Margaret, her eyes still a
little red, but her dress as usual perfect 
Margaret, with one rose in her hair and
another in her girdle, looking fair and
fresh, and pathetically humble, came round
the end of the house, and exclaiming, "
uncle ! you won't go without a cup of tea,"
changed her own destiny as well as that
of others.

"You can't refuse A?%" remarked Sir
Geoffrey sotto voce. " Upon my soul and
honour, you took quite a wrong meaning
out of what I said ; and hang it, whatever
I may be, she's your sister's child."

Have you two been quarrelling ? " asked
Miss Chelston, in quick alarm. "Don't do
that, don't  just, too, when I had made up

my mind to be so good and nice and
sweet to you both and everybody. Uncle,
you mustn't mind papa. Eeally he was
quite unpleasant to me yesterday. Papa,
uncle, is in a bad humour : he scolded me
half-an-hour ago till I had to go upstairs
and have a good cry by myseK. Xow
come in to tea, both of you," she finished,
with a pretty, imperious, and yet caressing
air which became her wonderfully, and
caused Mr. Gayre to consider, " After all,
something may be made of her."

Come," she repeated, taking Mr. Gayre's
arm and leading him towards the house ;
and you may follow us, you bad man,"
she went on, addressing her father, who,
for answer, put his fingers within the bit
of black velvet she wore round her neck
and gave it a twist.

Father and daughter did not exactly pull
together, yet still, upon the whole, they
understood each other pretty well.

Though the tea was lukewarm and extremely
bad Mr. Gayre swallowed one cup,
exactly as he would have with some wild
Indian smoked a pipe of peace. Sir Geoffrey
refrained from partaking of the beverage
offered for delectation, remarking his " liver
wouldn't stand it," which, considering v\'hat
he forced his liver to stand, seemed on the
part of that organ an extraordinary act of
rebellion ; but he was brood enough to o
into the dining-room, and prepare a brew
for himself that did not err on the side of
weakness. This he drank a good deal faster
than Mr. Gayre did his tea, while he drank
communicating the good news of Mrs.
Jubbins' invitation to his daughter, telling
that young person she could never sufficiently
prove her gratitude to the best of
uncles, and, during the course of the conversation
which ensued, artlessly inducing
his brother-in-law to state many acts in
connection with the state of the Jubbins'

finances he had not thought of imparting
previously.

By Jove, what a chance ! " considered
the Baronet ; and then he proceeded to
think, "if her ladyship would only be kind
enough to quit a world she never really
adorned, I'd have a try for that quarter
of a million  buried in the earth, as one
may say  and I'd get it, or else know the
reason why."

Which only proves that even baronets
may be liable to error. Sir Geoffrey
thoroughly understood the weakness of
human nature, but most certainly he failed
to estimate its strength.

SUSAlf.

Seated in his library  a room which,
 in a bachelor's establishment, ever
seems the pleasantness and most comfortable
in the house  Mr. Gayre, on the evening of
that same day when he fought Sir Geoffrey
on his own ground, and felt perhaps,
ashamed conscious of having led Mrs.
Jubbins astray, or at least allowed her to
stray, permitted his own soul the luxury of
a day dream. During the course of his
life he had not indulged in many ; and now
and then a doubt would intrude as to
whether anything could come of this vision,
or if it would end like the others in grief and
humiliation and disappointment. But in that

quiet twilight hour doubt seemed exorcised.
After all, why should happiness not be his?
If in some things he had failed, in others
he had succeeded ; in no respect could hebe
accounted an unfortunate man. The
stars in their courses had not fought against
him as they did against Sisera. ''I ought
to have no quarrel with Fate," he thought,
for Fate has done a great deal for me ;
and, perhaps," he went on, contemplating
his air-castle with an eye of faith, '* she has
been keeping the great blessing of a good
pure wife for the last."

Dreams, fair dreams ! Were they only,
after all, to be dreams? Was his day to
end in darkness, illumined by the golden
beams of a mutual love? Was life to hold
nothing for him of the beauty and the
glamour which only a woman can shed over
it ? " Ah, no ! " he murmured ; and through
the gloom it seemed to him that a figure,
clad all in white, came gliding to his side ;

that a delicate hand lay clasped m his ; that
a pair of tender brown eyes looked wistfully
in his face ; that a soft touch smoothed
the coming wrinkles from his brow ; and that
at last, tremblingly, he clasped to his heart
the wife he had Awaited through the long
lonely years to meet.

Already he felt as if he must have
known her always. They were strangers
no more. He heard her speak, and her voice
sounded familiar to him. She smiled, and
the waters of his soul reflected back the
pleasant sunshine.

Had they, in some former and happier
state of existence, wandered side by side
through flower-decked meads and winding
leafy lanes, it could not have seemed more
natural to him than it did to find himself
pacing the never before trodden fields of
Enfield Highway, in which the mowers were
busy with their scythes, filling the air with
the delicious perfume of recently-cut grass.

Her little tricks of manner and speech and
look and movement struck bim with no
sense of novelty.

I must have been acquainted with Susan
Drummond the whole of my life," he
decided ; " that is to say, for a good many
years before she was born." Her very name
sounded to him accustomed; homelike seemed
its simple melody. Susan  Susan  Susan 
Susan Drummond, with her fair honest face ;
with her hair, which was neither brown nor
yellow nor red, but a marvellous mixture
of all three ; with her exquisite complexion
and sweet tender mouth  he recalled them
all ; and yet each individual and to be particularised
beauty faded into nothingness
beside the intangible and indefinable charm
which had its source no man could tell
where.

Had she been smitten with smallpox, or
lost a limb, or become suddenly old, Susan
would have been Susan still. There are

women who retain, whether in youth orage,
some subtle and inexplicable essence of
womanliness as far beyond analysis as the
scent of a rose. Whatever the fashion of
the earthly tabernacle her soul inhabits,
nevertheless from the windows of even the
poorest habitation some passer-by catches the
glimpse of a countenance never for ever to
be forgotten.

Mr. Gayre at all events felt he could
not, while life lasted, forget riding along the
Green Lanes and through Southgate, and
thence,  many devious roads, into Enfield
Highway.

Are you quite sure where you're going,
Gayre ? " asked his interesting brother-in-law
Sir Geofirey, whom he had seduced into
setting off on a wild-goose chase after a
fellow who owned a wonderful hunter on
the London side of Waltham.

JS'o, indeed, I am not," answered Mr.
Gayre despondently ; " but I mean to inquire

about my man at each " public " we
pass."

Which performance, greatly to the
Baronet's satisfaction, was gone through
duly and truly with negative success, till
the pair reached a certain hotel, noted in
the old days, that still did a roaring trade
by reason of excursionists to the Eye House
and Broxbourne Gardens.

"Does I know a german as owns a
'ransome bay 'unter? Why, in course I
does  Squire Temperley, of Temperley
Manor. But, Lord love you, sir, it ain't of
no manner of use riding on to see 'im ! 'E's
been away  let's see  a matter of three week
with the gout, which do nip him up sore."

Mr. Gayre mused. It was not his fashion
to rush into dialogue.

What sort of looking man is your
Squire ? " he asked at length, while he
slipped half-a-crown into his informant's
hand.

Well, sir, 'e's not unlike yourself in
build and fissure, only 'easier and a trifle
more advanced in years "  Mr. Gayre
winced ; " a very pleasant german, and
most out-and-out rider ; didn't mind taking in
'and any 'loss  got the most splendid 'unter
to be seen in all these parts  a regular
wild one ; no person can, to say, really ride
'im but 'himself and young Mr. Arbery."

"Young Mr. Arbery? Who is he? Not
Squire Temperley's son, of course ? "

o sir ; Mr. Arbery is the son of Mrs.
Arbery, Granston 'Ouse, just above 'ere.
'E's just back from the Australis, and we
'haven't seen yet the 'horse could throw 'im."

Having with a commendable pride finished
which statement, the ostler, whose manners
happened to be of a more free-and-easy
description than obtained in Lombard Street,
was good enough to " throw his eye over
Mr. Ga}Te's steed," and remark " she was
a tidy sort of beast, who I essay can go."

"Well," asked Sir Geoffrey, coming out
of the bar, where he had been taking something
" just for the good of the house,"
"have you dropped on your friend's track

yet?"

Yes, I think so," answered 'Mr. Gayre ;
and having received some further information
on the exact position of Granston House,
the pair departed, only walking their horses
up the Great North Eoad, but nevertheless
eliciting an observation from the ostler that
he hoped he might be blanked if those
gents didn't know something about riding."

On they went past the church and into
the older part of the village, which even so
late as 1874 was little more than a mere
straggling street. They had got into the
region of a few unpretentious shops, when
Mr. Gayre started so suddenly that his
mare sprang forward with a bound which
elicited a profane inquiry from Sir Geoffrey
as to "what the ailed the brute."

His brother-in-law did not answer. Apparently
he was devoting his whole attention

to " the brute," but in reality his eyes

were following two persons who chanced
to be sauntering slowly along the footpath ;
one was a lady wearing a white straw hat
and pique dress of the same colour, both
trimmed with black ribbon ; the other the
young fellow he had seen in the Park.

He had found his quarry, and yet, though
Repassed the pair so close that he could
almost have laid his hand on Mr. Arbery's
shoulder, he did not pull up and accost him.

Shyness was a fault from which, as a
rule, the banker might be considered perfectly
free ; but at that moment he felt it
impossible even to turn his head in the
direction of the very persons he had come
to seek.

Not so Sir Geoffrey. That woman must
indeed have been old at whom he would
have failed (to use his own expression) to



take a squint ; and, following his usual
practice, he proceeded to honour with a
hard stare a girl whom he had already decided
possessed " a deuced good pair of
ankles ; " then,

Lord bless my soul I " he exclaimed, ina
tone loud enough for all the village to
hear, "if it isn't Susan Drummond ! " and
Mr. Gayre, at last looking back, beheld Sir
Geoffrey standing in the middle of the road,
with his horse's bridle slipped over his arm,
shaking both Miss Drummond's hands, and
expressing his delight and wonderment at
meeting her in such an out-of-the-way place
so volubly that he was well-nigh unintelligible.


Gayre, Gayre," he cried, " stop a minute
this is Susan ; Susan Drummond, you
know. By Jove, who'd have thought of
coming across her here ? Susan, this is
my brother-in-law ; gad ! I never was so
surprised in all the days of my life ! What

Vol. 1. 16

in the world are you doing in Enfield Highway
? "

Watching her, Mr. Gayre saw a shadow
of disappointment creeping over her face,
lit up the instant before with a delighted
smile of pleasure.

Did not Maggie tell you I was here ? "
she asked.

How should she know ? " demanded the
Baronet.

\' Why, I saw her one day in Hyde Park,
about a month ago ; didn't she tell you ? "
repeated the girl.

Not a word ; if she had you may be
very sure I'd have been down here before
now. I  " and Sir Geoffrey was about to
plunge into the whole story of Peggy's
statement that she did not know even the
address of her old friend, when a look from
Gayre arrested the words on his tongue.

You know what a careless forgetful
baggage it is," he said, with great presence

of mind, " and how much fonder she always
was of telling things to other people than
her own father ; however, now I've found
you, I won't lose sight of you again ; you
must come over and see Peg, and have all
out with her. Come and pay us a long
visit."

But Susan made no answer except, " You
are very kind, but you always were kind
to me. Sir Geoffrey."

"Papa Geoff," amended the Baronet.
Where are you stopping ? Who are you
with? What are you doing? I am amazed.
Who'd have thought of seeing you here ? "

"There is nothing remarkable in seeing
me here," she answered, " but it is astonishing
to see you. I should just as soon
have expected to see Chelston Church spire
coming up Enfield Highway as you. What
can have brought you to this part of the
world?"

"My brother-in-law wanted to find some

16-2

fellow about a hunter  ''' Sir Geoffrey was
beginning, when Mr. Gayre interposed.

"This is the very gentleman I wanted to
see, I think," he said, looking towards Mr.
Arbery, who had stepped into the background.
" As I did not know your name,"
he went on, speaking to Miss Drummond's
companion, " we have had a great deal of
trouble in finding out who you were and
where you Heed."

Well, it's all right now, isn't it ? " exclaimed
Sir Geoffrey. " Susan, my dear, I
am so glad we came ; you can't think how
pleased I am to see you again."

"This is my cousin, Mr. Arbery," she
said, acknowledging the Baronet's hearty
words with a smile which chased the
shadows from her face ; and then, with a
pretty grace, she introduced him to Mr.
Gayre, which ceremony duly performed,
they all walked on together to Grand ton
House, where the young man said his

mother would be delighted to see them.
It is more than doubtful whether Mrs.
Arbery was anything of the kind ; nevertheless,
she received the unexpected visitors
with a good grace, and asked them to stop
and take early diner.

We always dine early," explained Will
Arbery, " but you can call it luncheon ; "
and then, while Sir Geoffrey was making
himseK agreeable to Mrs. Arbery, Avhom
he afterwards spoke of as " shaky  deucedly
shaky," and Susan left the room, probably
to add a few touches to the appointments
of the dinner-table, Mr. Arbery and Mr.
Gayre talked, not merely about Mr. Temperley's
hunter, but other equine matters.

At the meal to which they all subsequently
sat down the conversation was general. It
turned a good deal on Australia, and Mr.
Arbery, who found much to say, and said
it well, interested Mr. Gayre considerably
within account of life on a great sheep-run.

He had three brothers settled in Australia,
and one sister  all married. " So when I
get back," he added, " there will be five
of us out there, old married folks. If we
could only induce my mother to come too,
we should be as happy as possible."

Mr. Gayre looked at Miss Drummond,
who smiled amusedly in reply, while Mrs.
Arbery said, "I shall never cross the sea,"
in a tone which told the banker this was a
sore subject in the family.

But 'pon my soul," exclaimed Sir Geoffrey,
" it seems to me a splendid idea. Why
can't we all go ? What do you say, Susan 
will you pack up and let us leave England
together?"

Ko," she answered ; " like my aunt, I
never mean to take so long a voyage."

"I have asked her already, and she refused
me," declared her cousin.

That is very true. Will," she said ;
"but perhaps, if you had implored me to

share the sheep-run instead of helping to
catch wild horses, my answer might have
been different."

At which they all laughed  Mrs. Arbery
a little sadly, Mr. Gayre with a sense of
relief. Sir Geoffrey delighted to find his
old favourite " as saucy as ever," and Will
Arbery after the fashion of a person who
felt himself fairly hit.

Xo, Susie, it wouldn't," he said, looking
at her with fond, but merely cousinly,
affection. *' You are far too much of a
bloated aristocrat ' for Australia ; you like
purple and fine linen, and servants, and
regular meals, and nice furniture, and "

I like civilization, if that is what you
mean," she summed up. "I think a sheep-run
in Cumberland or Wales, or even
Ireland, might be all very well ; but I
confess I should not care for it a thousand
miles from a post-office."

Hearing which declaration Mrs. Arbery

sighed deeply, and Mr. Gayre drew his
own conclusions. He understood there sat
the wife Mrs. Arbery would have liked
for her son, and he could not exactly
understand why " cousin William " had
elected to go further afield, till a few
weeks afterwards, when Susan was good
enough to enlighten him.

I don't fancy," she said, slyly, one day,
men usually fall in love with a woman
because their mothers think the particular
she ' will make a good daughter-in-law."


After dinner they went out on the lawn,
which was perched high over the road,
and where the whole "Way" might have
watched them promenading had it chosen ;
then they wound round the house to a
pretty trim flower garden, laid out in the
Dutch style, and from thence Susan, and
Mr. Gayre, and Sir Geoffrey, and young
Arbery strolled down the pleasant meadows,

in which the grass was being cut and the
hay being made.

A stream bordered by pollards meandered
at one side of the fields ; large Aylesbury
ducks were disporting themselves in the
water ; afar off, beyond the level marshes,
rose the rising ground, near Sandstone
and Chingford ; there was a great silence
in the air, and it seemed to Mr. Gayre as
if suddenly he had left some old life of unrest
behind, and entered a land where
trouble could not enter.

Even Sir Geoffrey assumed quite a different
aspect sauntering through those Elysian
Fields with his hat off, discoursing learnedly
with young Arbery about country affairs, or
turning to speak to Susan as she and Mr.
Gayre lagged behind.

You wouldn't like to jump that stream
now, would you, Susie ? " he asked, as they
came to a standstill at one particular bend
of the river.

No," she laughed. " I do not feel so
young as I did once, and besides, this is
wider than the Shell even at the Pleasaunce."

I am not so sure of that," said the
Baronet, surveying the sluggish water dubiously.
"Well, perhaps you are right. Lord,
Lord ! shall I ever forget that day when I
was out in the Long Meadow looking at
Lady Mary  do you remember that chestnut
filly, Sue?  the prettiest thing, the
very prettiest!  seeing you come tearing
down the green walk, With Lai Hilderton
behind you, racing like two mad things ! I
shouted out to you to mind the river ; but
you just gathered your skirts about you
and took it like a deer. Gad, I never saw
a patch upon it before or since ! And,
afterwards, you stood mocking Lai, he on
one side, and you on t'other."

He did not follow, then ? " suggested
Mr. Gayre.

If he had, he'd have pitched right in

the middle of the water. Lai was no
jumper."

"Ah, but couldn't he pant, Sir Geoffrey?"
said Susan, with just the faintest mockery
of an Irish accent as she uttered a completely
Irish sentence.

' Yes, certainly he was clever with his
pencil," agreed Sir Geoffrey.

"And who was this Mr. HildertonP"
asked LIr. Gayre, feeling really he could
contain himself no longer.

0, an old neighbour," answered Susan
carelessly. "He was intended for the Church,
but preferred art and went to Eome to
study. For the credit of Chelston, we hope
he will be a great man yet. About three
years ago he was good enough to comedown
to see us aborigines, and caused
quite a sensation in a velvet suit and a
red tie."

"And all the ladies fell in love with
him, I suppose ? " said Mr. Gayre bitterly.

I think a great many did," agreed Miss
Drummond. " He really is very handsome."

What a strange girl !  one who spoke
of men and life and wooing and marrying
as if she were seventy years of age ; who
addressed the representative of Gayre, Delone,
Gayre and Co. as though she had frisked and
frolicked about Chelston Pleasaunce with
him ! How frightfully easy were her manners
!  well, perhaps not so easy as indifferent
; and 3'et  and yet who was the
only woman that since that crazy fancy of
his youth, had ever seemed winsome to him.

Already he loved her distractedly ; already
he felt, on the slightest provocation, madly
jealous. The first six words she spoke had
not disenchanted him  quite the contrary.
She was different from the girl he expected
stronger  a woman better worth loving
and winning  a woman such as, in all his
previous experience, he had never before
met, and 

"I think, Gayre, we must be seeing now
about getting back to town," said Sir
Geoffrey, who, fond though he might be
and was of Susan, fek the pastoral business,
enlivened by champagne and the hope of
a dupe, wonderfully slow.

To this proposal Mr. Gayre at once
assented. He felt that, whatever his own
wishes might be, he and the Baronet could
not stay at Granston House for ever ; and
accordingly, declining young Arbery's
hospitable suggestion that they should stop
and have tea, and ride home in the cool
of the evening, it was finally settled their
horses were to be saddled and taken to the
back gate, where Susan undertook to pilot
the visitors in ten minutes.

The back gate is really the carriage-gate
here," she explained ; " only we have no
carriage, and nothing in the stable, excepta
cow and a donkey."

Killing that ten minutes  a process

which Sir Geoffrey thought occupied about
ten hours  they paused beside a Marshal
Noel which ran over the drawing-room window.


Give me a rose, Susie," said the Baronet ;
and then, as she complied, added ; " Give
Gayre one, too. Now," he went on, " you
must fasten it in my coat, in memory of old
times. What jolly little buttonholes you
used to make up for me at Chelston ! Only
look at Gayre  see what a mess he is making
of the performance. Better let Susie take
your rose in hand "

Now, the fact was that Mr. Gayre had
never in all his life worn a flower in his
coat. Affecting a severe simplicity, he
eschewed jewelry, perfumes, buttonholes,
and every vanity of latter-day male life ;
but not knowing what on earth to do with
the rose Susan had given him, feeling he
could not go about dangling it in his
hand, he was, when Sir Geoffrey spoke,

vainly attempting to coax it to stay in his
left-hand lapel.

Will you really take pity upon me ? "
he asked ; and the blood came up into his
face as he put this question.

0, certainly ! " said Susan ; and while
fastening the stem, she looked up at him,
blushing too, but with a merry light in her
brown eyes.

Gad," exclaimed Sir Geoffrey, complacently
surveying his decoration, " they'll
think along the road we've been to Brox-
bourne Gardens ! " a remark which induced
such an expression of disgust on Mr. Gayre's
countenance that Susan laughed outright,
and explained the correct form of bouquet
generally borne home in triumph from that
place of gay resort.

Wliat people will imagine, Sir Geoffrey,
is that you must be a great rose fancier,
and are returning from Paul's at Waltham,"
she said ; which suggestion of his 

being mistaken for a florist so tickled
Mr. Gayre's fancy that, his good-humour
quite restored, he joined in Miss Drummond's
merriment.

You are a bad, bad girl ! " declared
the Baronet, pinching her cheek. " Come
now, before we leave, you must tell
me what day I am to drive over for
you."

Then instantly Susan's manner changed.
She didn't know ; she was afraid she could
not go ; perhaps Margaret might be able
to arrange to run down by train and spend
a day with her ; excuses Sir Geoffrey cut
short by saying decidedly,

Now look here, my girl, no use our
beating about the bush ; you're huffed,
that's what you are, but you needn't be.
Peggy will be only too glad if you'll come
and stop with us  not for a night or two,
remember, but on a long visit. She's just
as lonely a girl as you will find in London,

and she has not a friend on earth she likes
as she does you. Of course, you know,
we are down in the world a bit, but
you cannot be the Susan I know if that
makes any difference."

I was sure the poverty touch would
fetch her," he remarked afterwards to Mr.
Gayre ; and it did " fetch " Miss Drummond
so far as to induce her to say
she would try to go and see Maggie," if
that young lady would write and name an
hour when she should be likely to find
her at home.

"I think I did that pretty well,"

remarked the Baronet, as he and his

brother-in-law rode straight down the wide

Highway to Edmonton, cheered by Mr.

Arbery's parting assurance that whichever

road they took back they would fancy

the longest. " I think I did that pretty

well, considering: we had nothing? but water

at dinner. How people can drink water.
Vol. 1 17

as if they were beasts of the field, beats
me altogether."

If you were on the march, and
couldn't get any, you might change your
opinion."

I might," said Sir Geoffrey, in a tone
which implied he did not think such a
change very likely.

However," he went on, " I am going
to stop here for a minute to ' bait ;' "
and suiting the action to the word he rode
up to the door of the inn, where he had
previously partaken of spirituous refreshment,
leaving Mr. Gayre to walk slowly
on and admire the prospect of flat country
which alone met his eye, look where he
would.

"I feel another man now," declared the
Baronet, when he overtook his brother-in-law.
" Well you haven't told me yet what
you think of Susan."

She seems a very nice girl," answered

Mr. Gayre, coldly as it seemed to Susan's
enthusiastic admirer.

Nice ! I believe you. There's not a
dark corner about her. I've known her 
how long haven't I known her?  the
dearest little woman ! I used to think it was
a pity I could not harness her and Peggy
when they were children ; such a pair
they'd have made  Susie in blue shoes,
and my young one in red ; blue and red
sashes, blue and red necklaces to match ;
and later on, while Peg was posturing
before a looking-glass  if you believe me,
from six years of age she was always
putting flowers in her hair and smiling at
her own reflection  Susie would be out in
the paddocks with me, or sitting in the
dining-room while I told her stories."

Stories ! " repeated Mr. Gayre in amazement,
wondering what sort of fairy-tales
the Baronet's repertory contained.

"Yes, stories," said Sir Geoffrey, defiantly.

172

I don't mean, of course, nursery-tales
or foolish stuff such as most children are
crammed with ; but good sensible stories
about duels, and races, and shooting, and
spins across country  things likely to improve
her mind. Lord, how she used to
drink them in ! holding her breath almost
till we got to the end of a run, and
clutching the arms of her chair with both
hands, and well-nigh gasping as I told her
about flying over hedges and taking bullfinches,
and all the rest of it. She'd never
have been what she is if it hadn't been
for me. One evening I made a great mistake.
I don't know how I happened to
get upon Dick Darrell, who was the hardest
rider and the wildest devil I ever did
come across. He was going to be married
and settle down, and the young woman
was stopping at Darrell Court with the
father. Dick thought he'd have a burst
with the hounds ; and if you believe me,

when I came to where at the last fence
he went clean over his horse's head and
broke his neck, Susan fell to crying to
such an extent my housekeeper wouldn't
let her go back to the Hall that night.
Ay, it seemed a hard thing to take Darrell
home stiff; such screaming and weeping
and wailing I never heard  the old man
childless and the bride a widow, as one
may say."

What became of the bride, as you
call her ? " asked Mr. Gayre, with some
interest.

0, she stayed to comfort the Squire ;
and comforted him to such purpose that
they made up a match between them."

I thought as much," remarked his
brother-in-law sardonically. "Where's your
rose, Chelston ? "

Faith, I don't know," answered the
Baronet, glancing at his coat, and for the
first time noticing the flower had disappeared.

" I must have knocked the head
off as I was mounting this fidgety beast."

Mr. Gayre smiled, but said nothing.
On the whole he was not perhaps displeased
that Sir Geoffrey had lost his Marshal
Mel, as he had already lost the whole of
his other possessions.

Seated in the twilight then, it was of
Susan Drummond and Enfield Highway and
fields of emerald green, and a blue sky
just flecked here and there with snow-white
clouds, and the air filled with the fragrance
of new-mown hay, that Mr. Gayre thought,
as he dreamed his day-dream, and built fancy
castles with towering pinnacles that glittered
in the sun. Why should he not win and
wear her? Why should he not marry and
be happy? Why should she not come
stealing to him through the gloom, and
fill his empty heart, and change his lonely
life into one of utter content?

She was young, very young, no doubt ;

and he was old  yet not so old, after all.
She was poor, and he was rich enough to
drive her all he fancied she could desire.

o

Women had figuratively torn caps about
him ; why should he despair of awakening
an interest in Susan Drummond? She had
no lover  he felt sure of that ; quite sure
the depths of her nature had never yet
been stirred.

The twilight deepened ; it grew so dark
he could not see the objects surrounding
him ; and yet he dreamt on, till suddenly
the door opened, and an old servant, who
had been with him " through the wars,"
said,

"Mr. Sudlow, Colonel, wishes to know
if he can see you."

"Yes," answered the "Colonel," coming
back to earth and its realities. "Ask him
to walk in ; and brincr Hcrhts and coffee."

DC

MR. Ludlow IS ADVISED FOR HIS GOOD.

glpIGHTS and Mr. Sudlow appeared
IjbSk together  the former in tall silver
candlesticks, massive, and of an antique
pattern ; the latter in all the splendour of
evening dress. As they shook hands Mr.
Gayre surveyed his visitor.

Going to some scene of gay festivity ?"
he inquired.

Mr. Sudlow coloured a little.

No, nowhere very particular," he
answered. " I just looked in on  on my
way. 1 thought you would not mind. I
have called so often lately and always
found you out."

Yes, it has been unfortunate," remarked

the banker, ; but he did not proceed to
indulge in expressions of regret, or tender
any explanation of or apology for  his
absence. He only asked Mr. Sudlow if he
would take some coffee, and while he
sipped his own stood leaning against the
mantelpiece, looking thoughtfully down on
the flowers that filled the wide hearth.

For a few moments the younger man
did not speak ; then he said, as if in a
sort of desperation,

"Mr. Gayre, when are you going to
introduce me to your brother-in-law?"

Mr. Gayre, thus directly appealed to,
laughed, took another lump of sugar and
stirred his coffee, before he answered,

1 am sure I cannot tell ; fact is, the
more 1 see of the worthy Baronet the less
I consider his acquaintance a blessing to
be desired."

But you promised me," expostulated
Mr. Sudlow ; " you did  you know you did ! "

Did I ? Well, perhaps so ; only circumstances
alter cases, and with the fresh
understanding I have recently gained of
Sir Geoffrey's character, I should certainly
advise any one able to keep him at
arm's length to do so."

"But it is not Sir Geoffrey I want to
know  it is his daughter."

"My dear fellow, don't excite yourself;
of course, I understand it is the daughter.
But you can't make her acquaintance
without at the same time mains that of
the father, and, as a friend, I say have
nothing whatever to do with Sir Geoffrey
Chelston. You think you can take care of
yourself, I know," went on Mr. Gayre ;
that the owner of Meridian Square will
be more than a match for the Baronet,
without an acre of land or a house of his
own. On your own head, then, be it.
You shall become acquainted with a
gentleman who, to quote those words of

Mr. Pickwick which so deceived the widow
Bar dell, will teach you more tricks in a
week than you would ever learn in a year."

And when ?" asked Mr. Sudlow, suggestively.


Only to consider the impatience of
youth !" exclaimed Mr. Gayre. " Perhaps
you imagined I Avould take you to call
this minute," he added, with cruel irony ;
"but I won't hurry you along the road to
destruction. One of these afternoons we
will search out Sir Geoffrey, about the time
he arises from slumber and before he goes
forth to seek whom he may devour. But
one word of caution, Sudlow," went on
Mr. Gayre, with a short bitter laugh ;
don't let him choose you a horse."

You may be very sure I won't "
returned Mr. Sudlow, with energy.

I am aware you think you play
billiards pretty wellstill, were I in your
place, I would not pit my skill against the

Baronet's. Further, do not lend him any
money ; do not let him persuade you to
put your name to paper; be very wary of
all games both of chance and skill ; refrain
from laying or taking odds  "

"Anything else?" asked Mr. Sudlow a
little sulkily.

Well, no, except that you would do
well to have nothing whatever to do with
Sir Geoffrey Chelston."

You must permit me to be the best
judge of that."

"All right, so you shall; only I should
be very sorry to see Meridian Square, and
all the other elegant and convenient, if less
profitable, properties you possess, converted
into ducks and drakes ; and that is a
conjuring trick the Baronet will perform
with incredible rapidity unless you are very
careful."

' I believe he has bit you'' said Mr.
Sudlow, with a certain triumph.

"You are mistaken in that belief,"
answered Mr. Gayre, the coldness which
lead characterised his manner during the
interview deepening into displeasure. " In
which direction are you going, Sudlow ? I
will walk part of the way with you. I
want a stroll and a cigar."

In some places and with some people
Mr. Sudlow was often bold, not to say
arrogant ; but the banker exercised a deterrent
influence over him, which he felt
perhaps rather than understood.

With almost any other man he might
have prolonged the conversation, and indulged
in further argument ; but since his
youth he had looked up to and feared Mr.
Gayre. Habit accordingly proved stronger
than indiscretion, and muttering something
about the Strand, and looking in at one of
the theatres, he took the hint so plainly
given, and rose to go.

They passed together into the quiet street.

and under the peaceful stars sauntered
slowly along, speaking no word for some
little time, each busy with his own
thoughts, whatever those thoughts might
be.

It was Mr. Sudlow who broke the
silence, and his first remark proved he had
been considering how to give Mr. Gayre a
rap over the knuckles.

I was surprised to meet Miss Chelston
the other day."

"In the Park?"

No, I have not seen her there for a
long time. At Baker Street Station."

"Romantic," commented Mr. Gayre, who,
had he spoken frankly, would have said he
felt a great deal more surprised than Mr.
Sudlow.

"A railway-station is as good a place to
meet a lady as any other in these days,"
retorted the younger man.

"It may be, you ought to know."

She was going to Kew."
You mean my niece, I suppose ?"
Yes ; and we travelled down in the
same compartment."
"Indeed!"

She went to one of the old houses on
the Green."

"Once more referring to Miss Chelston?"

Of course ; I did not know it was

necessary to go on repeating a woman's

name in conversation, like ' my lord ' in

an official letter."

! " and Mr. Gay re walked on, smoking
steadily, and refused utterly to ask a single
question, though Mr. Sudlow waited and
longed for him to do so.

"True love will excuse many things,"
began the banker at last ; " still, as neither
Sir Geoffrey nor his daughter is aware you
fell in love with my niece the first day you
saw her riding remarkably badly in the
Park, I really do not think I should ever

mention that you followed Miss Chelston
in the manner you seem to have done. The
Baronet might think you had been  spying.



How do you know I was not going to
the Green too, on my own business ? "

I do not know, of course ; I only suppose.
And under any circumstances I
should not advise you to mention the
matter  I really should not."

"I only mentioned it now to show
youth

show me what?" asked Mr. Areas
the other paused and hesitated ; " to
show you could form my niece's acquaintance
without my help. Make no mistake
on that point, my friend  you might get
to know a milliner's apprentice by travelling
in the same compartment with her to Kew
on Whit-monday, but not that of a girl ina
higher rank of life."

"You are always so hard upon me,"

complained Mr. Sudlow. "You generally
take a wrong construction out of what I say."

Then learn to express yourself in such
a way that misconstruction is impossible,"
returned Mr. Gayre, sternly. " At all
events, understand clearly that though Sir
Geoffrey Chelston is an unprincipled roue
his daughter has never caught even a
glimpse of Bohemia, and I mean to take
very good care she never shall. Fortunately
she has not the slightest inclination in that
direction ; I believe a girl never lived more
capable of understanding and resenting the
impertinence of modern puppyhood than
my niece."

Do you suppose I was going to offer her
any impertinence ? "

"How can I tell? All I know is you
had better not."

"Mr. Gayre, on my honour  "

Your honour ! Well, well, let that pass ;
proceed."

Vol. i. 18

"I wish you would not so constantly
catch me up  you make me forget what
I intended to say."

That is a pity, for you were, if I mistake
not, about to remark you admired the
calm dignity of Miss Chelston's manners,
when answering the observations made to
her by a gentleman ' who travelled in the
same compartment all the way to Kew,*
as much as her beauty. Come, Sudlow,
confess my niece snubbed you effectually."

"She did not do anything of the sort."

Do you expect me to believe she talked
to you?"

"No, no! 0, no! She did not talk, but
she was quite polite. Said ' no,' and ' yes,'
and ' thank you,' and that."

Evidently regarding you as an outer
barbarian all the time," suggested Mr.
Gayre, with relish. " Yes, I know her style.
Frankly,' he added, 'for your sake I am
very sorry this has happened ; why can't

or won't you remember all girls are not
barmaid, and that the fascinating manner
and brilliant conversation which prove so
effective across a marble-topped counter
are really worse than useless with young
ladies who have been discreetly brought up? "

You are always preaching to me,"
observed Mr. Sudlow.

And with so little result I think I
shall leave off preaching altogether."

You are offended, and I declare nothing
in the world was further from my intention
than to annoy you."

We had better let the subject drop."

"But you will introduce me to your
niece ? "

"I shall have to reconsider that matter.
Second thoughts are often best."

"But, Mr. Gayre, indeed, I meant no
harm. Pray do not speak to me in that
tone. You know I would not voluntarily
vex you for the world."

1? 2

Mr. Gayre burst out laughing. It was
the best thing possible for him to do under
the circumstances.

Three quarrels in one day ! " he exclaimed.
"It would be wise, I think, to
get me home and send for a doctor. Nevertheless,
Sudlow, it was truth that I told
just now. You must mind your p's and q's
when I introduce you to Sir Geoffrey
Chelston."

"I'll take good heed to every letter in
the alphabet, if that is all," exclaimed Mr.
Sudlow, relieved. Yet as he walked away,
after parting from Mr. Gayre, who seemed
disposed to carry out the programme he
had indicated, so far as hiding him back
to Wimpole Street was concerned, he
muttered under his breath, "0, if I only
once could get the chance of giving you
change in your own coin, I'd make your
ears tingle ! I wonder what has come to
you lately ! You always were given to

gibing, but since the Baronet appeared
on the scene you have grown unbearable."


Once rid of his companion, Mr. Gayre
only retraced the way for a short distance
towards Wimpole Street. Instead he turned
in the direction of Manchester Square,
and walking evidently for the sake of
walking, and not because he desired to
reach any definite goal, occupied himself
in reflections upon the occurrences of the
afternoon, devoting a considerable amount
of attention to that statement of Mr.
Sudlow's concerning Miss Margaret's visit
to Kew.

"I wonder who it is she knows at
Kew?" he thought. "Shall I try to get
her married ? " or, following the Canon's
sensible advice, settle a small annuity on
her and wash my hands of the whole
business ? Heavens ! what dirty water I
always seem to be dabbling in now! There

was a time when I would not have soiled
the tip of my finger With it. Alas ! and
alas ! Nicholas Gayre, Love has, I fear,
played you a scurvy trick once more.
You had better don cap and bells at once,
for you are a far greater fool than Sudlow,
and all for the sake of a woman concerning
whom you know next to nothing. I
wonder if she will be able to sweeten this
March  extract any healing out of such a
Bethesda ? "

For, indeed, when Mr. Gayre exhausted
the subject (and his mind was so constituted
he could not help exhausting any subject
which concerned himself, whether agreeable
or the reverse) he found he had since that
memorable day in May, when the horse
Mr. Arbery was riding shied at a steam-roller,
been travelling across a wilderness,
in which the few springs were very bitter
and the pools brackish, and playing an
extremely risky game. What he said was

quite true. There had been a time when
he would not have meddled in Sir Geoffrey's
concerns for any consideration. You cannot
touch pitch and not be defiled was a
truth the Gayres never cared to forget, and
Nicholas Gayre could not disguise from
himself the fact that his brother-in-law
could in no moral sense be regarded as
clean. The more he saw of him the more
hopelessly disreputable did the man appear.
Washing an Ethiop white would have been
a possible task in comparison with taking
even a part of the stain out of the Baronet's
nature.

In the days gone by, when Sir Geoffrey
kept his account in Lombard Street, on the
first occasion of his drawing below the large
amount which Gayres expected to be kept
as a balance, a letter was despatched to Shelton
Pleasaunce, directing his attention to
the fact, and begging that the mistake might
be rectified ; but, finding the same " mistake

" repeated, Mr. Gayre, Senior, requested
that the account might be closed.

This was the beginning of a coolness which
lasted up to the time when Mr. Nicholas
Grayre sought out his relative in North Banka
coolness which Sir Geoffrey's own conduct
intensified into total estrangement. The
banker thought of all this as he walked along
the London streets under the quiet stars, and
a feeling not unlike shame oppressed him ashe
considered how utterly at variance his own
conduct had of late been with the traditions
of his house.

And all because of a woman's face," he
decided. " Well, I can't draw back now.
I went into the Chelston pest-house with my
eyes open, and whatever happens I have only
myself to thank. Sir Geoffrey is not any
better than I expected to find him ; and my
niece is not much worse than I expected to
find her. She is false ; but she is not fast,
thank Heaven. I wonder who it is she knows

at Kew ? She ought not to be running about
London by herself; but I do not see that I
can interfere in the matter." And having,
just as he reached his own door, arrived at
this sensible conclusion, Mr. Gayre put his
key in the lock, and passed into the library,
where he saw a letter lying on the table.

It is from Sir Geoffrey, Colonel," said his
servant ; "a messenger brought it up from
the club. He did not know whether any
answer was required ; so I told him you were
out, and that I had no idea when you would
be back, but if a reply was expected I could
take it myself."

Mr. Gayre made no comment. He only
lifted the note with the usual dread and
repugnance with which he always approached
the Baronet's communications, and, tearing
open the envelope, read :

Dear Gayer,  Peggy is certainly turning
over a new leaf. What do you think she
proposed this evening ? Why, that we should

both run down to Enfield early tomorrow
and look up Susan. I can't tell you how
pleased I am. I have promised to be a good
boy and get home betimes to-night, so as to
be in condition for the journey.

'yours, G. C."

Now what is the English of this move ? "
marvelled Mr. Gayre. But he need not have
exercised his mind over this question. For
once Miss Chelston was playing a perfectly
straightforward game. " Circumstances ater
cases," and she felt as anxious for Miss Drummond's
company as she had once been desirous
of avoiding it.

SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT ? "

peace reigned in Mr. Moreby's villa.
The summer glory lay golden without,
sunshine dwelt within. Susan had come,
and the house seemed transformed. The
rooms were the same, the furniture was the
same, and yet everything looked different ;
the place had that charm of home it never
possessed before. Susan was there  with her
bright cheerful face, her pleasant laugh, her
useful hands, her constant thoughtfulness,
her unselfish heart, her tireless consideration
for others. Mistaken ! Ko, Mr. Gap-e understood
here at last was a woman sound to
the core ; a woman a man would be safe in
loving, and who herself could love till the

last hour of her life. Already he felt as if
he had known her for years  as if there
had never been a time when he and Susan
Drummond were total strangers.

They sat at tea in the charming room overlooking
the lawn ; sun-blinds excluded the
glare of light and heat, the windows were
filled with flowers. Sir Geofirey lay almost
at full length in an easy-chair ; his daughter
was looking her best, and trying to seem
demurely unconscious of Mr. Sudlow's admiring
glances.

Miss Drummond presided over the tea
equipage, and Mr. Gayre was taking her
part against the apparently good-natured
accusation of extravagance which Miss Shelton
was bringing against her.

But Susan needed no champion, she was
perfectly well able to defend herself.

If one is to have tea at all one may as
well have it good, and I am very sure the
extra cost cannot be a shilling a week. 1

excessively dislike tea that has been
brewed.' "

"So do I, Susan," exclaimed Sir Geoffrey,
who had been coaxed into accepting a cup
of the refreshing beverage, and was considering
how to escape drinking it. " I'd just
as soon take a dose of senna."

Your tea is certainly extremely nice,"
capped Mr. Gayre.

We are all teetotallers at Enfield, you
see," went on Susan, in calm explanation 
"my cousin from choice, my aunt on principle,
and I and the servants from necessity."

Susan, how can you say such things ! "
expostulated Miss Chelston, shocked.

Have I said something very dreadful ? "
asked Miss Drummond of the company generally.


No, faith," cried Sir Geoffrey ; " after the
wine your uncle used to have at the Hall
you must find water an awful cross to bear."

Happily the water is very good at Enfield.

But what I meant to say was, that as we have
no other extravagance we surely are justified
in making good tea."

You shall make it as you like here,
Susan. That lazy little minx always leaves
it to the servants, and nice stuff* they turnout
;" and the Baronet set down his cup and
took a little stroll to the window, and peeped
under the sun-blind and remarked he thought
a breath of air was stirring, and then asked
Susan when they were to have a long ride
together. "I'll find you a mount," he added.

I think there is one of my horses Miss
Drummond would like," remarked Mr. Gayre.

0, you don't want to ride, do you, dear?"
suggested Miss Chelston softly.

Yes, I do, very much indeed. But I must
first ore a habit ; I won't bring; eternal disgrace
upon you, Maggie, by wearing that
old thing I had on when we met in the Park."

It was a horror," said Miss Chelston.

Ah, well, it won't offend your eyes

again. I mean to have one of the latest
fashion, short and narrow, so that if I
am thrown I shan't have a chance of
helping myself."

Order it from my tailor, Susan," advised
Sir Geoffrey ; " he never expects to
be paid under six years."

You had better have it from mine,
Miss Drummond," said Mr. Sudlow ; " he
is a very good man, and allows fifteen percent,
for cash with order."

What a pull you rich fellows have
over us poor devils !" groaned Sir Geoffrey;
we are forced to pay through the nose
for everything."

"Thank you, Mr. Sudlow, for your suggestion,"
answered Susan ; " but I am
having the habit ' built,' as my cousin
phrases it, by the ' local practitioner.' "

Good gracious, Susan, you might just
as well put your money in the fire ! "'
said Miss Chelston.

Wait till you see this great work of
art," advised Susan. " I ventured to pay
the old man a compliment about the fit,
which he received with lofty indifference,
merely saying, " Yes, I think we are pretty
good sculptors ! ' "

Mr. Gayre laughed. Miss Chelston looked
disgusted, and Sir Geoffrey declared, "By
Jove, that wasn't bad ! "

"What is the colour of the thing?"
asked Miss Chelston.

The colour of the uniform of the Irish
Constabulary," said Miss Drummond, " invisible
green. I am not going to enter
into competition with you, though I do
think that precise shade of blue in your
habit divine."

And so becoming," added Mr. Sudlow,
as a general sort of statement which he
made particular by a look at Miss
Chelston.

And so becoming, as you truly remark,"

observed Miss Drummond, lauo-hinof,
to some persons y

At this juncture Sir Geoffrey bethought
him that the room was unbearably hot,
and that he would take a turn round the
garden to " stretch his legs a bit."

It was some time before he appeared
sauntering over the lawn, for it had been
necessary for him to pause in the diningroom
and refresh exhausted nature from a
convenient decanter.

Shortly Mr. Gayre joined him among
the flowers, and then learned his brother-in-law
was deuce idly sorry, but he had an
appointment he could not possibly miss.

Don't let me drive you away, Gayre,
though," he said. " Make yourself as much
at home as you can ; and look here you
bring your friend up some evening to
dinner. The girls make luncheon, dinner
when I am out ; but name your day, and
I daresay we can manage something fit to

Vol. i. 19

eat. Susan and Mrs. Lavender shall go
into committee."

Are you going to instal Miss Drummond
as housekeeper?" asked Mr. Careless

you, she has installed herself.
Peggy will do nothing but dress. There
never was such a girl for finery. She'll
have to marry somebody rich, for she'd
very soon bring a poor man to the workhouse.
Has it struck you that Sudlow's
mightily taken with her ? "

He seems to admire her very much."

Well, then, clearly understand, if he
means business I won't stand in the way.
Anybody with half an eye can see there's
not a bit of breed about him, but you say
he's well ofi*; nobody without money need
think of Peggy. It would be a great relief
to me to have her well settled ; so now
you know my views, and, as far as I am
concerned, your friend can propose as soon
as he likes."

But, good Heavens, he was only introduced
to her the other day ! "

I know that ; but ' happy's the wooing
that's not long of doing ; ' and between
you and me, the sooner we can get her off
our hands the better. A great deal of running
could be done in a short time ; and
the days slip away when you are living ina
borrowed house and have to trust to
your wits for money. I thought I would
just give you a hint of what is in my mind."

Most kind of you, I'm sure."

Well, my idea is a man can't be too
straightforward, and I may tell you the
sooner Peggy is married the better I shall
be pleased."

Surely you don't want, though, to
throw her at the head of the first person
who seems to admire her ? Don't be in
such a hurry ; give the girl a chance.
She may meet plenty of men more desirable
in every way than Mr. Sudlow."

19-2

She may," agreed Sir Geoffrey, " and
also she may not ; besides Gayre, a ' bird
in the hand,' you remember ; and don't
you make any mistake about sentiment,
and all that sort of thing, as regards
Peggy. She is as cold as a stone. She
cares for nothing on earth but herself.
K she had been different she might have
done well for both of us."

Then you had some plan in your
head when you brought her to London,"
thought Mr. Gayre, " which she has
baulked."

And she's not a bit clever," pursued
Sir Geoffrey, anxious, apparently, thoroughly
to convince Mr. Gayre of the
desirability of closing with the first eligible
offer. " All that can be said in
her favour is she's pretty, and she knows
how to dress herself."

Two very good points about a woman,"
commented Mr. Farewells

well, I only tell you for your
guidance."

But, Sir Geoffrey, she is not my
daughter ; if you want to get married
you had better set to work for yourself,
had you not ? "

I ! What can I do, a poor fellow
out at elbows with Fortune, who has had
the devil's own luck in life ? Besides, it
is not from my side of the house she
gets her selfishness and want of brains.
If I had thought more of myself and less
of other people I should not have been
placed as I am. I have been too considerate,
too honest, Gayre  that is about
the state of the case. Ah, if I had to
begin life over again, I would act very
differently!"

I wouldn't vex myself about your own
perfections, "were I you."

No ; it's of no use crying over spilt
milk. But, to come back to what we

were saying, you keep that matter in mind,
and remember if your friend likes to propose
I shall make no objection. Some
men would want to know a lot about
family and all the rest of it, but, thank
Heaven, I have no prejudices. Everybody
must have a befifinninof, and all I shall
require to be satisfied about is, can he
pay her milliner's bills and keep her as a
girl with such a face ought to be kept ?
All, talk of the  here she comes ! Well,
Peggy, how are you going to amuse your
uncle ? for I must be off. I am so sorry
Mr. Sudlow  confoundedly sorry ; but Gayre
has promised to bring you up to dinner
some day very soon. You'll come, quite
in a friendly way, won't you ? We are
very plain people, but sincere. I never
ask any man to the house I don't want
to see."

In which statement there was so much
truth Mr. Gayre felt that even mentally he

could not controvert it, while Mr. Sudlow,
almost trembling with pleasure, said he
would be only too delighted to accept the
invitation.

That's all right, then," said the Baronet
heartily. " Xow I really can't stop another
minute. "You'll excuse me, I'm sure, Mr.
Sudlow. Till our next merry meeting,
Gayre. Farewell, Peggy. You'll see the
last of me, I know, Susan ; " and he
turned back a pleased face to his 
as Miss Drummond slipped her
hand through his arm and went with
him into the house.

Something in that action seemed to
touch Mr. Gayre to the heart. He had
heard ere then of guardian angels, but
never previously did it fall to his lot to
see a pure and lovely woman taking charge
of such a sinner as Sir Geoffrey Chelston.

We must also be thinking about
going," he said ; but Miss Chelston pleaded

SO prettily for a longer visit that the
gentlemen consented to remain tiU nearer
dinner-time, and finally it was arranged
they should all go out for a turn in
Eegent's Park.

0, delightful ! " exclaimed Susan, when
the question was referred to her. " I do
think this part of the park so exquisite."

Half-an-hour later they were all strolling
along together  Susan in a black silk
dress, Margaret in a brown, which became
her as well as the blue cloth habit had
done. Eegent's Park was looking its very
best ; the ornamental water shimmered
and glittered under the beams of the
evening sun. The leaves of the trees
were fresh and cool, and free from dust ;
the birds were singing in the mimic plantations
; there was a great peace in the
hour and the scene, which seemed to lay a
soothing hand on the hearts of two, at all
events, who looked wistfully at the landscape.

"It is very, very pretty," said Susan
to Mr. Gayre ; and, looking in her face,
he agreed with her ; it was, indeed, very,
very pretty.

"Are Kew Gardens well worth seeing,"
asked Susan, after a minute's pause.

Yes ; I like the wild part best, however,
where one gets away from the excursionists."


Maggie and I are going down to Kew
tomorrow ; perhaps we might be able to
see the gardens."

They are open every day," said Mr.
Garret

was not that I meant ; we intended
to visit two dear old ladies that we used
to know at Chelston. They are the sisters-in-law
of the former Eector. They used
to live with and keep house for him.
Such charming ladies! You can't think
how lovely they were ; the pink in their
cheeks was so delicate, and their eyes so

clear and blue, and they dressed so
plainly, yet so spotlessly, if you know
what I mean ; and the poor loved them
so much, and with reason. Well, the
Eector died. But I am afraid I tire you,
Mr. Gayre."

Tire ! Your story enchants me."
The Eector died, and then it seemed
such a terrible thing for them to go
into lodgings and live on their poor little
income. I am sure I lay awake at nights
crying about them, for they were such
darlings. And then, in a minute, like
something in a fairy-tale, a distant relation
died, and left them a house on Kew
Green for their lives. They took their
lovely china and Indian curiosities up
there. I helped them pack. And a niece,
a widow, lives with them ; and they put
their incomes together ; and it really is a
delightful . ending to what might have
been a sad tale. They have a nephew,

an artist. I think you heard Sir Geoffrey
mention him."

Is he the son of the widow," asked
Mr. Gayre.

Xo ; his mother died loner and Iodo-

ago.

And is he still in Eome, or has he
returned to England ?"

I have not heard anything about him fora
long time. I shall know all tomorrow."

At last," thought Mr. Gayre, " I have
met a woman in whom is no ' shadow of
turning.' She is as transparent as glass.
She is frankness and truth itself." And he
felt mightily relieved ; for, after all, there
seemed no wrong in his niece's trip to Kew.

Save that she ought not to have gone
alone. But then, if she never went out except
with a chaperon, she might stop at
home for the term of her natural life."

Altogether it was an anomalous position.
Mr. Gayre, when he considered the matter

dispassionately, found it extremely difficult
to define the rank to which his niece belonged.


How fond, Miss Drummond," he said,
you seem to be of every thing and person
connected with Chelston !"

If you only could imagine," she answered,
" how happy I was there, you would
not wonder at my loving even the vagabond
curs running about the roads."

Chelston, she went on to tell him, was
the loveliest place in all the wide world.
Had he ever been there ? Yes, once. Did
he remember this, that, and the other about
the Pleasaunce, the yew hedges, the fish-ponds,
the cherry orchard, the great mulberry-trees,
the vineries, the billiard-room, the library?

At one time I used almost to live at the
Pleasaunce," she explained. " Sir Geofirey
was good to me ;" and then in a few words
she told how, when but two years of age,
her father died out in India, and her mother

drooped and pined, and was buried in Shelton
churchyard six months afterwards.

I never knew what it was, though,
really to miss my parents," she said.
Everybody was so kind. I do not think
any child could have been more petted and
spoiled than I. My dear uncle would not
even let me go to school to be taught, as
poor old nurse used to lament, to be like
other young ladies ; and I am very sure
Maggie is right in saying I did not learn
much from the governesses, who were supposed
to teach useful knowledge. Dreadful,
was it not ? "

And Miss Drummond, remembering many
pleasant speeches Miss Chelston had made
to her in Mr. Gayre's presence, turned a
mischievous laughing face to that gentleman,
who, though he only smiled in answer,
thought if his companion were to be
regarded as an example of total ignorance,
education might be dispensed with.

"I used to hear so much about you,"
Susan went on, " I feel as if I had known
you all my life. And then  papa was an
officer too."

"I wish I were an officer now," answered
Mr. Gayre heartily, " only that in such case
I might not have had the pleasure of making
your acquaintance. Should you like
to go back to Chelston, Miss Drummond ? "

I think not," she said, with a sad
dreamy look in her wonderful eyes. "You
see we cannot take up the past again just
as it was. It is like reading a book a
second time, or hearing a song, or seeing a
sunset. It is never the same twice. My
past was very beautiful, but it is ended.
You can't put last year's leaves on the
trees, and we  we can't stay children and
girls for ever. Pretty nearly all the people
I loved are dead or gone. No, I should
not care for Chelston without my kind old
uncle, and Sir Geoffrey, and all the other

friends I was so fond of." And for a
moment Susan turned aside, while Mr.
Gayre, who had his memories of loss, if not
of love, walked on in silence too.

Just then, while Mr. Sudlow and his
companion were gravely discoursing concerning
the latest on dit  the Queen and
Royal Family, the picture of the year,
and the play which was considered most
amusing, or the book attracting the greatest
attention  Mr. Gayre saw a gentleman
striding along the path, who, with eyes
bent on the ground and hat pulled over
his brow, passed beautiful Miss Chelston
without a look, and would have served
Miss Drummond in like manner had that
young lady not arrested his attention with
a cry.

"Lai!" she said, "Lai!" and then they
grasped hands, both hands.

0, I am so glad ! " she went on, " I
am so glad ! "

"Where in all the wide world, Susan,
did you spring from ? " he asked, his face
radiant with pleasure. " It is like the
good old long ago, meeting you again."

"I am stopping with the Chelstons,"
she answered. " Mr. Gayre, would you
mind telling Margaret this is Mr. Hilderton ? "

Sweetly and decorously, without any
undue haste or excitement, came back
the fair Marguerite. She did not call the
young gentleman "Lai." She did not greet
him with effusion ; she only said, " How
very odd! We intended to go to Kew
tomorrow."

Susan's friendship, however, was of quite
another kind. No cause to complain of
the warmth of her greeting. She insisted
on knowing " Where he was," " What he was
doing," "How he was doing." While Miss
Chelston seemed to be considering how
she could most gracefully efface herself,
Miss Drummond asked fifty questions.

"I have a studio in Camden Town,
Susan," said the young man, " and your
face is in a picture there. Come and see
it do."

Certainly I will," she answered. " Not
tomorrow, but the day after. Is it not
wonderful to have met you ? "

I don't know," he answered ; " I live
not very far away." And then, raising
his hat to the rest of the party, and
shaking hands with Susan, he was gone.

"How could you," asked Miss Chelston,
chiding  "how could you think, dear,
of saying we would go to Mr. Hilderton's
studio? The thing is utterly impossible."

Sir Geoffrey's daughter tarried behind
Mr. Sudlow to make this remark, and
her friend retorted,

I never said you would go ; but /
shall."

Now, Susan darling ! "

Now, Marguerite ! "

Vol. i. 20

And the two women stood tall and
lovely and defiant in the evening light.

If you would accept of my escort,
Miss Drummond," said Mr. Gayre, softly.

0, how very, very good you are ! "
exclaimed Susan, turning towards him with
that charming smile which seemed her
greatest possession ; " I should be so glad
if you would go with me. Not because
I mind what Margaret says in the least.
She knows, nobody better, that Lai and
I have been good brother and sister always,
and shall be the same, I hope,
till the end of our days. But if you
went with me, you might see some picture
you admired, and then you could
talk of it to your friends, and, perhaps,
somebody might buy it. Lai is very, very
clever ; but  "

"Is that the Lai who did not jump
the river at Chelston?" asked Mr. Gayre.

Miss Chelston had, apparently in stately

disgust of her friend's frivolity and impropriety,
resumed her walk with Mr.
Sudlow.

Yes. Poor Lai ! I am afraid he will
never jump any river anywhere," said
Miss Drummond, sadly. "Don't you know
that sort of man ? But, of course, you
must be acquainted with all sorts of men.
There are people who can write books,
and paint pictures, and compose music ;
and yet not sell a book, or a picture,
or a song. I am afraid Lai won't do
much good so far as making money is
concerned, and yet he has such genius.
He did a crayon likeness of uncle, which
was, indeed, his living see. Poor, poor
Lai ! Isn't he handsome ? "

With a light heart Mr. Gayre agreed
the young man was uncommonly handsome.


"I do not think it is well for men to

be so very good-looking," observed Miss

20-2

Drummond. " I know his beauty has
been Lai Hinder ton's ruin. His aunts denied
him nothing, and the women about
Chelston, young and old, thought he was
a nonsuch. Poor Lai! I have often felt
sorry for him. You will look at his pictures,
won't you, Mr. Gayre?"

If she only could have realised the fact
she had but to speak a little longer in
similar terms to insure the purchase of Mr.
Hilderton's whole collection!

HIGH FESTIVAL.

lyAYS swept by. Since Mr. Gayre left
IP the army, days had never sped along
so quickly. All his scruples vere gone,
his painful self-examinations ended. He
almost lived at North Bank ; he walked and
drove and rode with his niece and her
friend. Save for an uneasiness he could
not explain, an occasional doubt which
would intrude, he was perfectly, utterly
happy and content.

For some reasons best known to himself
most probably because he wished at once
to begin operations upon the widow's heart
Sir Geoffrey decided to accompany " his

girls " to Brunswick Square when the
luncheon " came off."

"I think it would be only a fitting mark
of respect to your kind friend," he observed
to Mr. Gayre ; who merely said
"Very well," and having duly apprised
Mrs. Jubbins of the pleasure in store for
her, announced that he would defer his
own visit till some future occasion.

According to the Baronet's account everything
went off delightfully. He knew he
had made himself most agreeable. Mrs.
Jubbins' acquaintance with that class of
nobleman " (brought prominently before
the public by the Tichborne trial) was
of the slightest. Indeed, she had never
before known but one " Sir " intimately, and
he was only a red-faced, snub-nosed, loud-talking
gentleman in the tallow trade, who
had been knighted upon the occasion of
some royal expedition to the City. In comparison
with him Sir Geoffrey's manners

when on good behaviour must have seemed
princely. Truly, as the widow told Mr.
Gayre afterwards, his brother-in-law was
most affable," " and I am quite taken with
your dear niece," went on Mrs. Jubbins.
She is a most lovely girl, and so sweet
and winning ; but I can't say I care for her
friend. What do you suppose she asked
my maid ? "

I really cannot conjecture. Was it
something very dreadful ? "

"Very impertinent, at any rate," declared
Mrs. Jubbins ; " she asked her if my hair
was all my own''

Miss Drummond," said Mr. Gayre, when
he next went to North Bank, " may I
inquire what induced you to put such a
singular question to Mrs. Jubbins' maid as
you did about that lady's hair ? "

It was not Susan, it was I," interposed
Miss Chelston. " I did not mean any rudeness,
though it seems Lies. Jubbins is very

angry with me. So she has been complaining
to you, has she ? "

Yes, but she said it was your friend.
Miss Drummond, what are you laughing at? "

I can tell you," said Miss Chelston,
as Susan murmured " Nothing." " She is
wondering if Mrs. Jubbins let down her
back hair to prove to you it was ' all
real, every bit of it ; ' for that is what
she did the other day, when expressing
her righteous indignation to Susan."

My acquaintance with that back hair
is of too long a date for practical assurance
to be necessary," answered Mr. Gayre,
joining in Susan's mirth, which was now
uncontrollable.

Her hair is as coarse as a horse's
mane," put in Miss Chelston, spitefully.

no, Maggie. It is not as fine as
yours, but it is magnificent hair, for all
that," said Susan.

"I do wish you would call me Marguerite

! " exclaimed that young lady. " I
haTe told you over and over again I detest
hearing Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, from
morning to night ! "

I'll call you Griselda, if you like,"
said her friend slyly.

What I cannot conceive," remarked
Mr. Gayre, " is how Mrs. Jubbins came to
imagine you were Miss Drummond, and
Miss Drummond you."

It was all papa's fault," answered Miss
Chelston. " You know the ridiculous way
he talks about Susan being his own girl
and his favourite child, and his two
daughters, and all that sort of thing ;
and poor Mrs. Jubbins, whom I really do
not consider the cleverest or most brilliant
person I ever met, got utterly bewildered.
Besides, Susan set herself to be so very
agreeable that I know I must have seemed
a most reserved and unpleasant young
person by comparison ; and, of course, Mrs.

Jubbins imagined Mr. Gayre's niece could
not be other than delightful. She still
believes Susan to be me. For some reason,
when Susan called the other day to inquire
concerning the health of Mrs. Jubbins'
ankle, she did not think it necessary to
explain the mistake."

I thought it would be wiser to give
her time to forget that little matter of
the hair," observed Miss Drummond.

You had better try to make your
peace, my dear Marguerite," suggested Mr.
Gayre, a little ironically. "I know no
kinder or better woman than ]airs. Gubbins
; and it will grieve me very much if
she and you do not get on well together."

"If I can make her credit I am really
your niece she will forgive me readily,"
said Miss Chelston, in a tone which told
Mr. Gayre she understood the widow's feelings
towards her uncle, and did not approve
of them.

Indeed, the whole question had been very
freely commented upon by Sir Geoffrey and
before Miss Drummond.

I shouldn't wonder," declared the
Baronet, "if they make a match of it yet.
I think she'll bag her bird, after all. He's
a strange fellow, but I daresay he'll settle
down in the traces one of these days. I
am sure he might have her for the asking,
and I don't think it would be a bad thing
for him, eh, Susan ? "

It does not strike me as very suitable,"
answered Susan.

She's not exactly his sort, but she'd
make him comfortable, I'll be bound.
With such a lot of money any woman
must be considered suitable ; besides, Mrs.
Jubbins is not bad-looking, and she's a
good soul, I feel satisfied."

Is not Mr. Gayre rich enough ? " asked
Susan. "I should have thought it was not
necessary for him to marry Money."

Bless you, my girl, nobody is rich
enough. Gayre must have plenty ; but I
daresay he could do with more, and it
would be an actual sin to let such a
fortune slip out of the family."

Susan did not say anything further, but
she thought a great deal ; and she often
afterwards looked earnestly at Mrs. Gubbins,
wondering whether Mr. Gayre would
ever marry that lady, and supposing he
did how his notions and those of his wife
could be made to work harmoniously together.
She liked Mr. Gayre immensely ;
but somehow she felt she did not like him
quite so well since the Baronet broached
that idea of marrying the widow for the
sake of her money.

And yet he was so kind and considerate.
It was he who made her visit utterly
delightful. Margaret and she had their
little tiffs and misunderstandings. Sir Geoffrey
 well, Sir Geoffrey did not seem to

her quite the Sir Geoffrey of old. " We
go on," as she observed so truly to Mr.
Gayre ; and oftentimes we find old friends
do not suit us if they have not gone on
our way.

Much as faces change  age, sadden, alter
-they do not change half so much as
souls. This is what makes it so hard to
take up a friendship again after a long
separation. We may get accustomed to
gray hair that had kept its sunny brown
in our loving memory  to wrinkles  to
dim eyes  to the bowed head and the
faltering step ; but what we never grow
reconciled to are the moral changes wrought
by time, the faults which have become
intensified, the latent weakness we never
suspected, the falsehood where we would
have pledged our lives there existed only
truth, the frivolity and the selfishness
where we never dreamed to find other than
high aims and noble aspirations.

To the young the process of disillusion
seems terrible, and Susan found that to be
forced to see her friends' faults was very
bitter indeed.

Nevertheless, spite of Sir Geoffrey's
eternal Jeremiads on the subject of money,
and his daughter's jealousy, irritability, and
lack of ordinary straightforwardness, Susan
did enjoy stopping at North Bank. It was
such a delightful change from the deathly
quietness and dull monotony of Enfield
Highway, from her aunt's lamentations,
and the conventionality, not to say stupidity,
of her cousin's intended wife.

Constant variety was the rule at Sir
Geoffrey's : except when Margaret and she
were alone together, Miss Drummond never
felt dull.

"I daresay I should tire of the Hfe after
a time," thought Susan ; " but a little of it
is delightful."

Flower-shows, concerts, exhibitions  Mr.

Gayre took the girls to everything that
was going on. Sometimes Mr. Sudlow was
of the party, but the banker never seemed
particularly desirous of his company. He
was waiting to see whether some better
chance might not open for this niece. The
closer he came in contact with that gentleman
the less he liked him, " and yet he
is good enough for her," was his deliberate
conclusion.

Happiness, in those bright sunshiny days,
made Mr. Gayre almost amiable. Dimly it
occurred to him that if he married Susan
he could then give Margaret the opportunity
of meeting men of a different class and
stamp altogether. He had quite made up
his mind to ask Susan to be his wife; but
he did not want to be precipitate. He
wished to woo her almost imperceptibly, to
make himself necessary to her before he
spoke of love, and win her heart, if slowly,
surely, and run no risk of even a temporary

rejection. He could not do without her.
She was the woman he had been waiting for
through the years  sweet, tender, spirited,
truthful. Life seemed very beautiful to him
then  well worth living, indeed.

Properly speaking, Miss Drummond's sojourn
at North Bank was rather a succession
of short visits than one continuous stay.
Every alternate week she returned to En-field,
remaining there from Friday till Monday
 sometimes for a longer period ; besides
this, she and Miss Chelston went to stop a
little time with their old friends at Kew ;
and when Mrs. Jubbins took up her abode
at Chislehurst she often had both girls staying
there.

The widow was in a state of the highest
excitement concerning a great party she
meant to give. The Jones had celebrated
the change to their new house with a ball ;
the Browns had got up a picnic really on
a scale of unprecedented magnificence;

whilst it was known the Eobinsons intended
to ask all the world and his wife to a tremendous
entertainment, when their new
mansion " at Walton was ready for occupation.


So I really must do something," declared
Mrs. Jubbins to Mr. Gayre ; "it would bea
sin and a shame to have such a house
as this and not ask one's friends to it."

"Better give a garden-party," suggested
the banker ; " and then the young people
can have a dance in the evening."

So said, so done ; the invitations were
written and posted. Every one Mrs. Gubbins
had ever known was asked, and a
great number she never had known.

Sir Geoffrey begged her to give him
some blank cards, and promised to secure
the presence "of a few young fellows well
connected, and so forth."

The Jones, Browns, and Eobinsons, and

many other rich families  all of the same
Vol. i. 21

walk in life  had each two or three intimate
friends who wanted, of all things, to
make dear Mrs. Jubbins' acquaintance.

Mrs. Jubbins even asked Canon and
Mrs. Gayre and the Misses Gayre, and received
by return of post an emphatic refusal.
The widow was unwise enough to
mention that she expected Sir Geoffrey
Chelston and his beautiful daughter to be
of the company.

What a set your brother has got
amongst!" said Mrs. Gayre to her husband.
"I should not be at all surprised to hear
any day he had married that Jubbins woman."
"Neither should I," groaned the Canon.
"There is one comfort, however, she is
enormously rich''

O, I don't believe in those City fortunes,"
retorted Mrs. Gayre : " look at your father !"
My dear !" exclaimed the clergyman, less
in a tone of endearment than of mild remonstrance.


The garden-party, to which Mrs. Jubbins
had bidden a crowd of people, and with which
she intended to inaugurate a new epoch,
wherein "she should enjoy her money, and
have some good of her life," promised indeed
to be a unique affair. Where expense is no
object it is comparatively easy to compass
success ; and on this occasion, if never on
another, the widow announced her intention
of not troubling her head about sixpences
a resolution which met with unqualified
approval from Sir Geoffrey.

In for a penny, in for a pound," he said,
in his off-hand, agreeable way ; and then he
asked Mrs. Jubbins how she " stood " for
wine, and offered to take all trouble concerning
her cellar off her hands, by having
anything she wanted sent down by his own
wine-merchant, "who supplies an excellent
article," finished the Baronet, " and is a
deuced nice sort of fellow."

"Affable," however, though the Baronet

212

might be, friendly as well, and indeed on
occasions homely in his discourse, Mrs. Gubbins
was not to be enticed into taking her
custom away from the houses that had won
the favour of Mr. Jubbins deceased, and
Mr. Jubbins' father before him. She would
as soon have changed her church ; sooner
indeed, because in her heart of hearts she
inclined to a moderate ritual, while the Gubbins
had always pinned their simple faith
to black gowns, bad music, high pews, and
the plainest of plain services.

At every turn Sir Geoffrey's proffered suggestions
met with a thankful but decided
rejection.

For the commissariat department, concerning
which the lady's ideas were of the
most liberal description, Mrs. Jubbins felt
that she and her butler and her cook, and
the City purveyors, would prove equal to
the occasion.

I am not afraid of being unable to feed

my friends," she said to Sir Geofirey ; " only,
how am I to amuse them?"

"Let them amuse themselves," answered
Sir Geoffrey. " Gad, if they can't do that
they had better stop away."

He had laid out his own scheme of entertainment,
and also given a private hint
to Miss Chelston it would be wise for her
to make " some running with that Sudlow
fellow." "Remember the crooked stick, my
girl," he advised, " and while we are in
comparatively smooth water try to get a
bit ahead. You mind what I say to you.
If you don't, the time won't be long coming
you'll repent having neglected my advice."

Plants by the van-load, muslin by 'the
acre, relays of musicians, luncheon and supper
from a firm of confectioners well known
to City folks, waiters whose dignity would
not have disgraced a Mansion House dinner :
The Warren looking charming in its setting
of green trees, guests alighting as fast as

the carriages could set down, a hum of
voices, dresses of every possible fashion and
colour, ladies young and old, winsome and
passee, girls and matrons, gentlemen in
every variety of male costume, people who
had respected Mr. Jubbins, and people who
respected Mr. Higgs' daughter ; the combined
odours of all the flowers on earth,
as it seemed, mingling with the sound of
rattling china and jingling glass ; everywhere
a Babel of tongues : guests sauntering
solitary over the gardens, wondering
how they were to get through the next
few hours ; groups chattering on the lawns ;
sunshine streaming on the grass through a
tracery of leaves and branches ; rabbits
scudding away into the plantations ; windows
open to the ground ; light curtains
swaying gently in the summer air ; white
pigeons with pink feet and wondering eyes
looking down on the company from the
roof; millionaires exchanging words of

wisdom about " stocks," and " Turks," and
Brazils," on the terrace which once " his
lordship " had no doubt often paced ; Mrs.
Jubbins nervous, triumphant, handsome ; her
'children in a seventh heaven of delight ; Sir
Geoffrey Chelston in a perfectly new white
hat and pale-blue necktie, talking to everybody
his discerning glance told him might
be made worth the trouble ; Margaret radiantly
beautiful, in a dress which suited her
hopes and expectations ; Susan more simply
attired in accordance with her certainties ;
Mr. Arbery escorting a young lady whose
ultimate destination was Australia ; Mr. Lai
Hilderton looking handsome, forlorn, and discontented
; a sprinkling of clergymen ; a few.
unmistakable West Enters ; this was what
Mr. Gayre saw when he walked up from
Chislehurst Station to The Warren on that
glorious afternoon in August.

The number of persons who declared it
was " a perfect day " could only have been

equalled by those who talked about Lord
Flint and the Earl of Merioneth and the
widowed dowager. Though all dead or
absent, the " noble family " seemed to pervade
the whole place.

The rooms were inspected, their appointments
criticised, the style of architecture
examined in detail. Opinions differed as to
the convenience of the residence as a family
mansion ; but every one agreed it was just
the place for a party. Such a number of
rooms, and all on the ground-floor !

"It is like wandering through the courts
in the Crystal Palace," said one young lady.

As fine a billiard-room as I'd ever wish
to see I " exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.

Never could have believed any man out
of Bedlam would build such a place; it is
offering a premium to burglars," grumbled
an old alderman.

"Dear me, I should not care to sit in
these great drawing-rooms by myself ! " cried

a portly dowager, who, next minute, confided
to all whore it might concern, " I am such a
poor timid creature, though  a mere bundle
of nerves."

"Just fancy lying awake at night and
listening to the wind howling through the
trees I I would as soon hive in the middle
of an American forest," ventured a lackadaisical
miss to her neighbour, with a shudder.

I like it," answered the neighbour, who
happened to be Susan Drummond.

You don't mean to say you live here ? "
in a tone of mingled awe and horror.

"No, but I stay here sometimes."

And where do you sleep ? Surely not
in one of those dreadful rooms with only a
pane of glass between you and robbers ! "

I am not afraid. For twenty years I
resided in a much more lonely house than
this."

Eeally ! I wonder how any one can doit
; I could not ! I should die ! "

Come into the garden, do," entreated a
voice at Susan's elbow ; and, turning, she
saw Lionel Hilderton.

Crossing the spacious hall, they walked together
to the gardens, which were curiously-planned
on sloping terraces, rustic steps,
formed of logs laid lengthwise, leading from
level to level.

What a rambling sort of place this is ! "
remarked the young man irritably, as he
regarded the evidences of wealth which met
his eye at every turn; "and these huge
gatherings are a complete mistake. I don't
know a soul here."

You know m," said Susan, mildly.

Yes, you of course ; but then everybody
wants you ; and what a set of people they
are ! ''

Some of them seem very nice, I think,"
dissented his companion.

0, you find good in every one ; but they
are a lot of dreadful snobs, you may depend.

Of course I have not a word to say against
your friend Mrs. Jubbins, though she has
about as much appreciation of art as that
cow ;" and Mr. Hilderton pointed down to
the plantations, where a milky mother was
seeking food under difficulties calculated to
try her patience. " She  Mrs. Jubbins I
mean, not the cow  asked me the other day
what I would charge to paint her a picture
exactly a yard long. I found out she wanted
it to put in a frame she had by her not
worth twopence. Of course I said I could
not paint to measure. If these sort of
people do not know better they ought to
be taught."

I think I should have taken the order,"
said Susan.

I would not, then. If I have no respect
for myself I have for my art. To please you
I consented to paint her prosaic self and
hideous children, but I feel I can't stand
any more of that sort of thing."

You know I did all for the best."
Of course I understand that ; and I am
most grateful to you ; but you cannot think
how trying it is. You remember that picture
of ' Esther ' for which your friend, Mr. Gayre
said he would try to find a purchaser ? Well,
he sent a dealer  actually a dealer, a man
with dirty hands and diamond ring, and
heavy gold chain and thick nose, a Jew of
the worst type  who had the impudence to
criticise my work. He was good enough to
say ' Esther ' herself was not so bad, and
he was willing to buy that painting, though
the perspective was defective and the minor
figures unfinished. I told him he must take
'Mordecai' as well  that I could not part
the pair. He declared he would rather be
without ' Mordecai ' if I gave him the picture ;
but at last, finding me firm, offered eighteen
shillings extra!"

"Poor Lai! What did you do?"

Do ! I ordered him to leave the studio,

and next day had a note, saying I could
send a line ' to his place ' if I thought better
of the matter."

So you failed to sell ' Esther ' after all?"

I was forced to take his terms. I had
not a sovereign left."

They went a little further without speaking
a word ; then Mr. Hilderton took up his
parable again.

"And to see all these people absolutely
wallowing in wealth! It is utterly heartbreaking!
Don't you think so, Susan? 
now, honestly, don't you ? "

Well, no," she answered. " If they can
derive happiness from money and you from
art, surely it is better they should have
their money and you your art."

But I can't be happy without money.
I want ever so much. I'd like to be as
rich as Rothschild, if I could."

"In that case would it not be wise to
accept as many commissions as you can

get, even if the people who give them are
not particularly interesting? Were I you
I should try to paint Mrs. Jubbins and her
children as well as possible, and then she
might get you more orders. To be quite plain,
Lai, as you are in such want of bread-and-butter,
you ought not to quarrel with it."

What answer the artist might have made
to this extremely wise speech will never
now be known, for at that moment their
iete-d-tete was interrupted.

0, here are the truants ! " exclaimed
Miss Chelston, gaily : she and Mr. Sudlow
coming from an opposite direction, met
Susan and Mr. Hilderton somewhat unexpectedly.
"We could not think where you
had gone ; Mrs. Jubbins has been sending
in all directions after you. Aren't you
tired of walking about? You missed some
exquisite singing ; dancing will commence
presently  you had better come in and get
cool."

I am not at all too warm," answered
Miss Drummond ; " but I won't miss the
dancing as well as the singing."

And remember I am to have the first
waltz," said Mr. Hilderton.

"You shall have it, though you did not
ask me before," she laughed.

And then they all bent their steps in
the direction of the house, Mr. Hilderton
drawing his companion a little back in
order to ask,

Who on earth is that man, Sudlow ? "

"Haven't an idea," replied Miss Drummond,
in the same low tone ; " some one
Mr. Gayre knows."

He is rich, too, I suppose ? "

"I fancy so, but I don't know."

"He has eyes for nobody but your friend
Miss Chelston."

Your friend, too, or at least she used
to be."

"Ah, she is like every one else in this

vile place. She cares for nothing but
money."

"I am sure you wrong her," said Susan.

"It does not much matter whether I door
not. I am only a struggling artist. You
see she scarcely speaks to me."

It is her quiet manner ; she does not
mean to be unkind."

As they stood near one of the windows
watching the quartette slowly ascending from
terrace to terrace, Mrs. Jubbins was saying
at that very moment to Mr. Gayre, "Judge
for course'; I feel positive my idea is correct."

I should not have thought it ; but
ladies no doubt understand all these matters
better than we do," answered the banker,
courteously.

"And it seems such a pity, for she is so
good and charming, and he is so poor and
so impracticable."

We must try if we can't do something
for him."

"Yes, you are always thinking how you
can serve others." This was quite a stock
phrase of Mrs. Jubbins, and one which Mr.
Gayre had long ceased to deprecate. "But
I really can't see how he is to be helped ; "
and then the widow went on to relate the
painting by measure " episode, and also
another painful experience she had undergone
in her efforts to "bring the young
man forward."

Dear old Deputy Pettell came down to
call on me the other day, and you know
what a judge he is of pictures; he has bought
thousands of pounds' worth one time and
another. Well, I had got Mr. Hilderton to
take my darling Ida as a shepherdess with
a crook and sheep  such a pretty idea 
and there was the portrait m the smaller
drawing-room, and Mrs. Robinson and her
nephew Captain Flurry and Mr. Hilderton
in the other. Of course the painting instantly
arrested Mr. Deputy. ' What have

Vol. i. 22

we here ? ' he asked ; and he put on his
spectacles, and I was just going to remark
I hoped to introduce the artist, who fortunately
was at The Warren, when he said,
My dear Mrs. Jubbins, where did you
get this awful daub from ? It is one of
your girls, isn't it? I suppose that long
stick she is balancing over her shoulder is
meant for a crook ; but those things can't
be sheep  they have not even the remotest
resemblance to that animal.' "

What happened then ? " asked Mr.
Gayre, as the widow paused in her impetuous
narrative.

From the next room," answered Mrs.
Jubbins, " there came this, quite loud and
distinct : ' The man only knows a sheep hy
its head and trotters I ' I declare, Mr. Gayre,
I thought I should have dropped ; and I
felt so angry with Mrs. Robinson for laughing
outright  you are aware the Eobinsons
never liked the Petrels. But don't mention

the matter before Miss Drummond,"
added Mrs. Jubbins, hurriedly, as that young
lady, leaving her friends, turned to enter
by the window. " I wouldn't have her
vexed for the world ! "

Time  relentless time  flew by. The
afternoon had gone, the evening was going,
the time for the last train coming. Everywhere,
as it seemed, there was dancing 
in the dining-room, the larger drawing-room,
the library, so miscalled from the fact of a
few volumes of forgotten magazines being
there imprisoned within glass cases, locked
and bolted as though each book were valuable
as some old Elzevir.

The musicians were placed in the wide
corridor which divided the private part of
the house into two portions ; and in the
various rooms set apart for their use light
feet twinkled in the mazes of the dance,
and light hearts grew lighter and bright
eyes brighter as the old, old story, which

22-2

will never stale till the heavens are rolled
up as a scroll, was told in words or implied
in glances more eloquent than any form of
mortal speech.

"There never was such a party." At
last everyone seemed agreed on that point
the many who approved of the affair, and
the few who did not. As a "social gathering
" it proved a supreme success. No
stand-aloofism ; no proud looks and uplifted
noses ; no " How the deuce did you come
here, sir ? " sort of expression. The City
did not seem antagonistic to the West, or
the West supercilious to the City ; while
the latest fashion in suburbs did not disdain
to ask a few kindly questions concerning
dear old Bloomsbury."

There a High Church clergyman was exchanging
confidences with a wealthy Dissenter,
who had given Heaven only knows
how much to the destitute and heathen.
Young Graceless was dancing-with Miss

Reuben, who was reported to have a
fortune of a hundred and fifty thousand.
Beamish, the author of Fashion and Fancy 
brought to Chislehurst by Mr. Hilderton,
was showing some tricks in the card-room,
to the great mental disturbance of a few
old stagers, who looked upon levity in the
midst of a game of whist as a sort of act
of bankruptcy ; while Sir Geoffrey Chelston
having button-holed Mr. Jabez Falls, the
great match manufacturer, who was then
running a tremendous opposition to Bryant
& May, had just concluded a deal with
him for a pair of carriage-horses, subject
to inspection and a vet's approval.

The price may seem stiff," remarked
the Baronet (at the same time confidentially
recommending Mr. Falls to try some sparkling
hock ; " the very best I ever tasted ;
and I thought I knew every vintage worth
talking about " ) ; " but there is not such
another pair or match in London  three

parts thoroughbred ; action perfect, temper
ditto ; except that the mare has a star on
her forehead and the horse hasn't, might be
twin brother and sister. Now I tell you,"
and the Baronet dropped his voice confidentially,
"how they come to be in the
market. Bless you, I know all the ins
and outs of these things ; " and as he
made this perfectly true assertion. Sir
Geoffrey poured his new friend out a
fresh beaker of Ills. Jubbins' wonderful
hock. " Graceless  that young fellow coming
along now to get an ice for the pretty ghi
he has been waltzing with  who is she, did
you say?  had, owing to a little misadventure
 young fellows will be young fellows,
but you can't make old dowagers understand
that  got into the black books of his great
aunt the Dowager Countess of Property.
Well, he knew her ladyship's one weakness
was horseflesh ; so as a sort of propitiatory
offering, he got over from Ireland two of

the sweetest things ever put into harness.
They were just a bit wild at first, as all
Irish horses are ; they need coaxing and
humouring, like the Irish women, and then
they'll go through fire and water and to
death for you, if need be. He and I
trained them : took them here and there,
first wide of London, then nearer and
nearer, and into the Park, till they were at
last well-nigh perfect ; then what d'ye think
happened P "

I can't imagine ; perhaps one on 'em
fell lame," said the match-maker, lapsing
into a once-accustomed vernacular.

Lord, no," said Sir Geofirey ; " but the
Dowager died. When Graceless went down
to the funeral, he found his name not in
the will. That was last week. There are
the horses eating their heads off; and to
come to what I said, ]Mr. Falls, if they
don't do their twelve miles, half country and
half over the stones, in less than forty

minutes, why, I'll eat them, and that's all
about it."

The hall was set about with great banks
of flowers. Sitting, half hidden by ferns,
palms, begonias, and a hundred sweet-scented
flowers, that certainly were that
night not on deserts wasting their perfumes,
Mr. Gayre at length espied Miss Drummond,
whom he had for some time past been seeking.
She was nestling behind a great oleander,
with a scarlet shawl wrapped around
her shoulders, her hands idly crossed in her
lap, and her head resting against the wall.
Her whole attitude was one of listless weariness
; and it seemed so strange to see Susan
Drummond, of all people in the world, sitting
apart idle and silent, that Mr. Gayre was
about to approach and ask if she felt ill,
when Mr. Hilderton, hastily brushing past,
exclaimed,

Come, Susan, this is our dance."

I think not," she said ; " but, in any

case, I mean to dance no more tonight."


The translation of which is, you don't
mean to dance with me."

I intended you to understand my words

literally."

/

K I were Mr. Sudlow your answer
might be different."

As you are not Mr. Sudlow, and as he
will certainly not ask me, there is no use
speculating about my possible answer."

K you will not dance, then, come and
have an ice."

No, thank you. Like a dear good Lai,
do leave me in peace. I want to be quiet
for a few minutes. I really am very tired."

"The next time I ask you to do anything
for me  " began the young man.

"I'll do it if I can possibly ; but not tonight."


"That is all very fine. I am going,
Susan."

It delights me to hear it."

Perhaps some day you will feel sorry
for this."

I do not imagine I shall ; but you had
better leave me now to try to get up
strength to bear the regret you prophesy is
in store."

"Susan, I never thought I should almost
hate you."

Neither do you hate me seriously,
Lai ; you will regret your words tomorrow."


Is Miss Drummond not well ? " asked
Mr. Gay re at this juncture, calmly and
innocently, as though he had just come
on the scene.

I am only tired, Mr. Gayre," Susan
answered for herself; while, without deigning
an answer of any sort, Mr. Hilderton,
an ugly scowl disfiguring his handsome face,
turned away abruptly, and strode out of
the hall.

I fear greatly you are ill," persisted
the banker anxiously.

"No, indeed ; but I do feel very very
tired. I have been standing, talking,
or dancing all day, and am beginning to
think with Mr. Hilderton, these continuous
parties are mistakes. One has too much
for one's money," she added, with a laugh.

You are about the only person here
who thinks so, I imagine," said Mr. Gayre.
Let me get you a little wine. Sir Geoffrey
has been chanting the praises of some
hock, as though he had a cellar-full to
dispose of. Will you try its virtues? "

Not even on Sir Geoffrey's recommendation,"
she answered. " I think I will try
instead the efficacy of night air. Anything
to be quiet for a short time ; anywhere to
get away from the sound of those eternal
waltzes and mad galops."

May I  will you allow me to accompany
you ? " and the banker's courteous

manner formed a marked contrast to the
rude familiarity which had characterised
Mr. Hilderton's speech.

I should be very glad ; but I do not like
taking you away from your friends."

I have not many friends here," he
answered ; " and if I had  " But he stopped
in time, and drawing her hand within his arm
in the paternal manner he affected, led her
out on to the drive.

The terrace is crowded," he explained ;
which way shall we go ? "

Down towards the Hollow, please," said
Susan ; and accordingly, winding round the
end of the house, they struck into a narrow
tortuous path which led to the plantations.

How pretty it is ! " remarked Susan, looking
up at the lighted windows, from which
the music floated out into the peaceful night,
and sank tenderly down into the heart,
softened as music and bells always should
be by distance.

Yes, not a bad sort of ' Love in a
cottage ' place."

Too large for that," she answered.

What a bad character to give Love !
Do you think he could not fill all those
great rooms ? "

He might ; but still The Warren does
not fulfil one's ideal  at least my ideal 
of Love in a cottage : three small sittings
if Love were inclined to be extravagant,
a tiny tile-paved kitchen with
latticed casement, a thatched roof, m the
eaves of which martins and swallows make
their nests  it is said martins will never
build where man and wife disagree  a
trellis-work porch covered all over with
honeysuckle and jasmine  roses, crimson,
white and pink, peeping in at the windows.
No, The Warren is too stately a cottage
for ordinary lovers. The very place, of
course, for folk of high degree, but not
or common mortals. Do you know, I

have often wondered how a lord makes
love."

Very much like anybody else, I should
think," answered Mr. Gayre.

But Susan shook her head in dissent.

I should say not, though of course I
am no judge ; for I never knew but one
lord, and he was a dreadful old man.
People said he beat his wife, and certainly
she looked miserable ; and I knew for I
saw it  that he kept a book in which
every household item was entered. You
would hardly believe that the diary ran
something in this fashion :

' At luncheon to-day : Mr. Gayre, Mrs.
Jubbins, Sir Geoffrey Chelston, Miss Chelston.
Miss Drummond. Game-pie, cutlets,
blancmange, stewed fruit : nothing sent
down.' "

You cannot mean that ! " exclaimed Mr.
Gayre in amazement.

"Indeed I do. The book had been

handed to the housekeeper to convict her
of some sin regarding three sponge-cakes,
I think, and she showed it to me. I
looked at a page or two, and saw my own
name with this comment : ' Miss Drummond
was helped twice to cold heed! ! and I
remember also : ' Mem.  Never to ask
young Hilderton again ; he drank three
glasses of old madeira'' And poor Lai
really did not know what he was drinking."

"By the bye, I wanted to speak to you
about Mr. Hilderton," began Mr. Gayre.
"I could not avoid hearing what he said
to you in the hall just now."

Yes ! " said Susan, surprised ; and she
waited for the next words her companion
should utter.

chapter of accidents
; lie low and watch results.

But yet he must in some way indicate
the way of the wind to Susan. It was
essential he should tell her that ill-starred
engagement might be considered at an end ;
therefore next day, before he showed at the
bank, he repaired to her lodgings, where the
landlady, who in person answered the door,
greeted him with a pleased smile, and said,
Miss Drummond was at home.

He waited for her a minute or two, then
Susan appeared, and with a stiff bow recognized
his presence.

"You wished to see me," she said, laying
lier hand on the table and speaking as
though she had been walking very fast, and
found it strangely hard to get her breath.

"Yes, Miss Drummond, if you will kindly
sit down I shall perhaps be able to talk a
little better."

About Oliver ? "

"No, singular as it may seem, not about
Oliver. Besides that gentleman, there are a
few millions of other persons in the world,
myself a unit amongst them, you understand
that."

And, Mr. Gayre  ?" she said, rising and
looking strangely cold and resolute, as she
spoke.

Just for a moment he swayed his hat
gently to and fro ere he spoke  then 

I have come to release you from our
compact," he said, quite quietly.

She looked at him, startled.

Do you mean  ? " she asked, at last.

Just what I say," he answered, " I bring

you liberty ; never again need you look

at me as one abhorred ; never more will

it be necessary' for you to shrink from my

touch ; you are perfectly free."

He thought he heard her murmur, "My
God, I thank thee," but the cry of gratitude

was merged iu the question, "And what
about OHver. Oh, Mr. Gayre ! don't give us
both up together."

No," he answered, " no, I shall never
cease striving for his release till you and he
meet once more. Good-bye, Miss Drummond
good-bye, my dear. I was mad once, for
which I beg your pardon. I am sane now,
and really I do not think I need beg your
pardon at all."

But Avhat about Oliver ? "

"He must wait a little, his case is being
seen to. Gracious Heaven, Miss Drummond,
you have heard me just now give up my
soul's desire, and yet you never say, thank
you ; you have no thought or pity save for
Oliver.' Take him, marry him," added the
banker, shaken by a sudden whirlwind of
passion. " Only I pray God that, living or
dead, I may never hear his name again."

- Mr. Gayre  Mr. Gayre," she cried, rushing
to the door after him and laying a detaining

hand upon this arm, which he tried in vain to
-shake off

Go," he said, " go, I lament the day I
erst saw you, the hour I first spoke to you ;
till that time I respected myself fairly, but
sever since I have been acting a mean,
cowardly part towards my Maker and my
fellows. For the Almighty's sake, do not
tempt me to lose my soul and my substance
as well. I never was rich, and my love for
you has left me bankrupt, not merely in
heart but also well-nigh in pocket. Let me
go while I am master of myself  good-bye."

But still she held him, she clasped his arm
with both her hands, and her tears fell down
like rain as she sobbed " I can't bear it  I
cannot. You shall not leave me till you say
you forgive me  that we are friends."

Friends ! " he repeated, scornfully. " How
like a woman  to prate ahoiit friendship to a
man who has loved as I have loved. You
have been very cruel to me  you are not

Vol. iii. 64

really sorry for me now. You do not know
what love means when youth is over  when
spring has gone, and no fresh sap can ever
rise again to nourish one green leaf of hope
and promise."

Oh ! do not say that," she entreated 
"there will be a fair springtime yet for you.
The day must come when you will meet
some one you can love and marry  and  "

"I shall probably marry," he interrupted,.
but love again I never can  besides, who
could love me. You have taught me that
the whole passion of my soul  the undivided
affection of my heart  is incapable of winning
one tender smile, one feeling of regard  "

But oil ! " she said, looking up at him
with swimming eyes full of sorrow and
womanly pity, " my love was given long
before we met. If it had not been  had I
never known Oliver  "

He could bear no more. With a sudden
wrench he tore himself away, leaving the

girl, who liacl never come so near loving him
before, in an agony of grief. For the
moment she foro-ot even Oliver  the o-reat
tide of her faithful affection seemed to ebb
out in one husre wave  leaving an arid waste
of memory, on which was traced only the
image of a broken and despairing man.

Had she known more of his nature,
however, she would have understood that
paroxysm of ungovernable agony was but
the dying struggle of a passion which had
torn and tormented him. Even in the first
misery of that final parting, he felt a sense
of relief that all was over. The face of
his dead wore as yet no look either calm
or beautiful, but at least, the misery of
suspense would not have to be gone through
again for ever. He had suffered, no human
being could know how horribly  he had
grown hateful to himself  he had been
falling lower and lower in his own esteem,
till at last self-examination became torture.

642

He had done thugs of which he could not
have believed himself capable  he had
forgotten honour, mercy, justice, all, because
a woman had sweet, wistful brown ej'es,
and the fairest face he ever looked upon.

If love fail to purify the waters of a
human soul it fouls them, and it is not
without reason we pray the best instincts
of our nature may produce a blessing, nota
curse. It rests with each amongst us
to decide which course to pursue. We can
climb, blinded it may be into tears and shod
with sorrow, to heights, illuminated by a
sun which never streams across any low or
unworthy road mortality elects to tread ;
or we may trail our love through the mire
of earth, till nothing remains at last but
the marred and broken image, from which
our anguished hearts shall finally behold
the last trace of comeliness fade utterly
away.

ANYTHING BUT Pleasant.

'v, >/-v .

ROM the time settlements were first
mentioned his most partial friend
could not have described Mr. Sudlow as an
ardent suitor.

He had tried every means of avoiding
making any, and when he found Sir Geoffrey
what the baronet described as " stiff," he
bejran seriously to re-consider the whole
question of marriage.

He had learned that money makes any man
of value in the matrimonial market and it
occurred to him that he might do a good
deal better than Miss Chelston. He might
not get a more beautiful wife, but there
was no reason why he should not secure one

even better born and moving in the best
circles. Mr. Sudlow's only weakness chanced
to be a craze for good society, and he
had not long possessed the privilege of
Sir Geoffrey Chelston's friendship before
he clearly understood whatever the rank
of that gentleman's acquaintances might be,
his daughter did not visit at grand houses or
receive visits from ladies whose names were
ever likely to figure in the Court Journal.

Not all the baronet's finessino and talk
about great people could deceive him on
this point. For a short time he suffered
himself to be deluded into the belief that his
adored one could introduce him to those
charmed circles where fashion holds hisli
carnival, but this idea was soon dispelled.

As regarded Mr. Gayre also. Sir Geoffrey's
notion was rio-ht. The banker had ceased to
be a hero to his former admirer. There are
some persons it is unsafe to admit to a
private view of dignity in dressing gown and

slippers, and Xortli Bank and The Warren
exactly represented this sort of attire to Mr.
Sudlow's artless inexperience. To quote his
own mental phrase, he didn't " think much "
of the Chelston or Gayre set. He had never
met and he was never likely to meet the
Canon, and if he had, even that respectable
clergyman would scarcely to his mind have
represented a Court card. Sir Geoffrey
-certainly did know some persons of title, but
then as a rule they were black sheep, and,
whether black or white, took no pains to conceal
that they meant to have nothing whatever
to do with Mr. Sudlow. He was far
too careful and model a vous? man to find
favour in their eyes. He looked many times
-at a sovereign before changing it ; he would
not bet, he did not drink, he knew nothing
about horses, he was not amusing, or good-natured,
or useful ; he bored even Miss
Chelston to death, and she certainly was
not a peculiarly lively person.

Altogether Mr. Sudlow felt greatly disappointed
Avitli the result of the first love-affair
he had adventured upon that could
with any propriety, be spoken about, and
he was steadfastly purposed if possible ta
make those settlements a cause for breaking
off the match. It was ridiculous to expect
him to marry a mrl who had not a shilling
or a settled social position, who, spite of
being a baronet's daughter, was in reality
more thoroughly a nobody than himself
If Mr. Gavre liked to ive his niece a
fortune, he would put down an equal amount.
There was no reason why the banker should
not do this, yet Mr. Sudlow scarcely fel
brave enough to make the suggestion.

When he received a note, however, from
Mr. Gayre, asking him to call in Lombard
Street, lie began to think matters might
still take a favourable turn. He knew Miss
Chelston was in Wimpole Street, but he did
not know why, and under the circumstances.

it was natural enoucfli he should imagine
Mr. Gape at last meant to " act handsomely"
by her.

Walking along the Strand to keep the
appointment he ran across a man he had
met in North Bank. As a rule he passed
Mr. Sudlow with a careless nod, but on
this occasion he stopped and, with hands
plunged deep in his pockets and hat tilted
back from his forehead, said :

Heard if Chelston is out of danger ? "
I didn't know he was in any danger."
Didn't you really ? Awful smash  mare
bolted with him the very day after he went
down into Yorkshire ; he was picked up for
dead, so Graceless tells me. Pity, too ! never
saw a finer horseman. Hope they'll save
his leg," and Mr. Helsey, who was waiting
for a friend, leisurely took his cigar out of
his mouth and looked at it with a contemplative
cast of countenance.

I am very sorry," remarked Mr. Sudlow.

Sure you are  not half a bad fellow.,
Clielston. No one's enemy but this own.
That was a bit of a bother up at North
Bank, wasn't it ? "

I have not heard  "

Why bless my soul, you know nothing,
and I thought you were hand and glove there,
not but what Graceless said lone: 2fo he
believed you meant to cry off. You are just
as safe too, perhaps. Shouldn't care for
Clielston for a father-in-law myself, and
though the girl is quiet and demure enough,
still where there has been anything with the
mother I think its risky work. Jlliat I you
don't mean to tell me you never knew that,
I wouldn't have spoken only I made sure
you knew all about it. I believe Lady
Clielston was as little in fault as a woman
sever can be when she goes off with somebody
not her husband. It was a hard blow for
the Gayres ; the old man never really held up
Diis head after it. Ah ! here comes Jennings,

Hope Clielston will pull through all right.
Ta-ta."

Mr. Sudlow did not pursue his walk eastward
 instead, he dispatched a curt note to
Lombard Street saying he could not call,
and giving no hint when it might suit his
convenience to do so. The note reached Mr.
Oayre before he left the city  he kept very
different hours from what had formerly been
his wont, and he decided to take Mr. Sudlow
on his way home.

"I have come to have some talk with you,
Sudlow," he said, " about my niece."

"Yes, Mr. Gayre."

I consider matters are in a very unsatisfactory
state between you  and as her father
has left her in my charge I want to come to
a, thorough understanding with you on the
subject."

What is it you wish to know ? "

First, when the settlements are to be signed
next, when the marriage is to take place."

Mr. Sudlow hesitated  lie didn't like Mr.
Gayre's tone, and he liked the look of Mr.
Gayre's clenched hand laid firmly upon the
table still less. There was very little of the
banker about that hand, and there was a
great deal too much of the cavalry officer.
At that moment the old Adam was very
strong in Mr. Gay re. He had a fierce
desire to quarrel with somebody, and he
felt he would rather quarrel with Mr. Sud-low
than am other human beino\

I am waiting for your answer," he said.

You are very imperative," Mr. Sudlow
replied, " what is the cause of all this sudden
haste ? "

There is nothing sudden about the
matter. The affair has been at a stand-still
for months. On one paltry pretence and
another you have managed to put ofi* the
signing of these settlements from autumn to
spring, and we are no further forward now
than we were in the autumn."

That is true, and I fear we shall never
get any further forward."

What the devil do you mean, sir?" asked
Mr. Gayre.

Just what I sav. It is of no use trvini
to bully me, Mr. Gayre. I don't intend
to sion those settlements and I don't mean

o

to marry sour niece."

Mr. Gayre sprang from his chair, and Mr.
Sudlow sprang from his. Just for a moment
they looked across the table at each other,
then 

Sit down, you coward," said Mr.
Gayre, " I am not going to strike you.
Xow, tell me the plain English of all this ?
What makes you say you will jilt the
girl?"

I was duped into proposing to her."

You were what ? "

1 was misled."

Who misled you ? "

*' You must know I had every reason to

suppose lier father was a very different
person from what I fid him to be."

I know no such thing. From the very
first, when you woukl insist on being introduced
to my niece, I toil you in so many
words her father was a blacken, a scoundrel,
and a cheat. If you did not choose to believe
me  if you would persist in thinking a
baronet could not fail to be a paragon of
virtue, the fault was yours, not mine ; but
you did not think anything of the sort ;
you have some other reason for wanting to
back out of your engagement, and I insist
on your telling me what it is."

I always objected to those settlements."
"Why did you not then refuse to make
any ? When Sir Geoffrey said you should
not have his daughter on any other terms,
why did you not tell him fairly you declined
to marry her ? You have not acted straightforwardly,
Mr. Sudlow ; you have kept silly
about the affair till I am tired

of hearing it named. But I intend to put

matters on a different footing. It was come



patent for you once to withdraw your
offer  but you shall .not do so now. I
mean you to marry her soon  or else know
some excellent reason why you won't."

It is something outrageous to expect
me to make such settlements on a girl
utterly destitute of fortune."

It would be something outrageous if a
girl possessed of any fortune were willing
to marry you

Xow it is of no use takins' that tone
with me, ]mr. Gayre, I won't stand
it."

You'll have to stand it and a good deal
more before you have done with me,"
retorted Mr. Gayre. " And as we are upon
the topic, I tell you fairly that if my niece
had not been as selfish, calculating, and
worldly as yourself, I should never have
thought of letting her marry you. In most

respects you 'will, however, be admirably
matched."

We never shall be matched," interrupted
Mr. Sudlow.

"We'll see about that," said Mr. Gayre.

I should have married Miss Chelston
honos ago," remarked Mr. Sudlow, " if you
would have made some suitable provision
for her, but I am now (quite determined
to break off the affair entirely."

I know, then, what I shall do," and Mr.
Oayre took up his hat 

I have been kept most shamefully in
the dark. It was by the merest chance I
heard there had even been a scandal about
Lady Chelston  and  "

Oh ! that's it, is it ? " and Mr. Gayre
laid down his hat  " you had better think
twice about what you purpose doing, my
friend. When this matter comes into court,
as come into court it shall, it will be pleasant
for you to hear counsel state that the

individual who makes an old story about a
woman, who had such excuse as wife living
never could urge before, whose husband
never brought a charge against her, who
condoned her error, who laid her amongst
his own people, the pretext for refusing
to marry her daughter  is the grandson of
a felon, transported for life for robbery and
attempted murder."

"How dare you state such an infamous
lie ? "

Lie is a nasty word, but we will let that
pass. I always knew your grandfather had
been a convict, but I did not know the full
measure of his crimes till I came the other day
upon all the papers connected with the
affair. The public will find the story very
exciting' and entertaining reading have
nothing more to say now, except that I shall
be glad if you will remove your account tomorrow,
and transfer your securities to the
keeping of some other banker. You objected

Vol. iii. 65

to employing any solicitor over those settlements
 I should advise you to look out for
some sharp lawyer now, for you will require
one before you have done with me  Good
evening."

As he walked up Wimpole Street, Mr.
Gay re felt conscious that he was extremely
tired, and needed a long night's sound rest ;
but the day's work was not yet over. He
had scarcely sat down to dinner before
Eawlings announced that Mr. Colvend
wished to see him particularly.

"He will wait, Colonel" said the man.
'' He said you were on no account to disturb
yourself."

When Mr. Gayre entered his library he
found the poor old man sitting in a listless
attitude, with head drooped and hands
clasped together between his knees.

You must forgive me for coming so late,"
he began ; " but  " and there he stopped :
Twice he tried to finish his sentence and

failed, and then fairly giving way, he covered
his face and cried like a child.

What is the matter  what has happened,"
asked Mr. Garret

is my daughter, my poor Dossie. She
has had lrain fever  she has been dreadfully
ill," moaned Mr. Col vend, in a series of
gasping sobs  " Jut that is not the worst of
it. Oh, Mr. Gayre ! have pity upon me. I am
afraid what that scoundrel Fife said was too
true. There is no doubt she was fond of
Dane and that the trouble unsettled her
reason my unfortunate girl  my dear, dear
little Dossie."

"I am very sorry indeed for you," and Mr.
Gayre did feel most truly sorry for the
wretched father.

Yes, it is an awful business," went on Mr.
Colvend, wiping his eyes and trying to speak
calmly. "Awful, only to think of that young
fellow, and of that poor brave girl who stuck
to him through all  I dont know what to

652

do. How is this wrong ever to be set right.
Though she is my daughter, an innocent man
must not continue to suffer for her fault.
Would to God, Surlees had never given Dane
in charge ! The prosecution was quite against
my wish. The doctors do not think she will
ever recover her reason."

Under the circumstances that is perhaps
scarcely to be regretted," said Mr. Gayre.

Just the remark Dr. Johnson made ;.
but oh ! there is no living; creature can tell
what this has been to me ; ever since the
terrible truth was forced upon me, I have
thought about that unhappy young man till
it seemed as though I should go mad
myself."

I do not imagine if you join with me
there can be much difficulty now in procuring
his release."

I will do anything and everything in my
power. The cause of this frightful illness
was that Fife came to the house and told

Dossie, as all other means of clearing Dane
seemed unavailablejie meant to give himself up.
He frightened the poor little thing to death,
said her letters to him would be read in
court. Wlien I got home I found her in the
most dreadful state of mind ; of course I did
not believe she was in fault then, any more
their I believe Fife's statement that night you
came to see me at Brighton ; but I can't
blind myself any longer ; she had never
been crossed before, and she lacked strength
of mind to bear up under the trouble of
knowing Dane was in love with someone else.
Why couldn't he have fancied my darling? 
I'd have given her to him, poor child I She
was all I had  and now  "

Gone mad, has she ? " commented mr.
Fife, when mr. Gayre subsequently repeated
the substance of Mr. Colvend's statement to
that individual. " Don't you believe a word
of it ; she's not the sort to go mad. I daresay
she has had a touch of brain fever, but it

would puzzle a wiser man than Doctor
Johnson to tell where temper ended and
fever began. If they mean to get Dane
out, though, without any fuss or publicity, I
shall be well enough content now ; I am
going to turn over a new leaf and I think I
would rather not turn it before a magistrate."


It is a great pity you do not turn over
a new leaf," said Mr. Gayre, " for you certainly
are exceedingly clever."

And trustworthy," added Mr. Pise, " that
little matter of the cheque, notwithstanding.
Oh, I forgot to mention, Mr. Sudlow was at
the bank three times to-day while you were
out. He wants you to make an appointment
he left a message he had something very
special to say."

Did he ? " said Mr. Gayre, scarcely able
to refrain from smiling

GAYRE THANKS HEAVEN.

pGHT seeks slipped by so fast that
2 like the seven years Jacob served
for Earlier it seemed but a day, and Mr.
Gayre, seated one glorious summer's morning
in his private room at Lombard Street, was
dreamily reviewing the events which had
occurred since the previous July when a
letter was brought to him, directed in Sir
Geoffrey's sprawling handwriting. It was a
lengthy epistle that Mr Gayre cut open, not
without some curiosity as to what the
contents might prove.

"Dear Gayre" (began the baronet) 
Though you never liked me as much
as I liked you, I fancy you will be glad

to know I am at last getting better.
Whether my leg will ever lee a good legit
is difficult to tell. The doctors say not 
which is the reason, I feel inclined to think
it will. Lord, what a lot they are ! If
I had followed then bidding I'd have been
comfortably tucked up with a spade long
and long ago ! What do you suppose they
kept me  me  on for one blessed fortnight 
you'd never guess  milk in some confounded
form or other. Gad, I was so weak and
wasted at the end of that time, when I
looked down at my hands I thought they
belonged to somebody else. Remonstrance
was not a bit of good. Bless you, a
fellow that used to come and feel my pulse
two and three times a day would have
put a navvy on the same diet as a newborn
child ! I'd never have picked up
again if it had not been for the landlady,
who is as trim and smart an article in
petticoats as you ever set your eyes on.

She keeps all the business of this house
going  ostler, waiters, chambermaids, and
the whole trans: of them. Her husband's
occupation is dyincr as fast as he knows
how (the doctors have put him on milk
and soda water  ugh ! poor wretch) and
the only recreation he has strength enough
left to indulge in is whist. There are generally
some decent fellows stopping at this
hotel, so we manage to make up a party
most evenings. While I was pretty bad
we were in the habit of playing on my bed,
.so you see time has not been spent quite
unprofitably after all. However, as I was
saying, if it had not been for Mrs. Fits
rather a high-flying sort of name
isn't it P you would never have been troubled
more, by yours truly 

' For heaven's sake,' I said to her, ' get
me something fit for a man to drink  not
cat-lap.'

'But the doctor, Sir Geoffrey.'

' My dear soul,' I expostulated, ' I am
not a calf  if I were, I have no doubt I
should relish milk greatly ; being what I
am, if I don't have some brandy soon, I'll
not answer for the consequences.' Firmness,
Gayre  it was firmness saved me. How
Mrs. F.'s father did laugh to be sure, when
she told him ; his name is Sponner, and it
is said he had netted seventy thousand
pounds by always betting against the favourite.
He's a funny old chap, who can scarcely
write his name. 'That's a good one,' he
roared. ' Sir Geoffrey Chelston, the hardest
rider and the heaviest drinker in England,
put into training on kettle tea and
pap. No  no, my lass, that won't do at
any price. We'll find him something better
than that, doctor or no doctor.'

"You may imagine I am pretty comfortable
here. I don't exactly know who is
going to pay the piper, but I rather expect
Dash wood will stump up. 'Twas his mare, or

rather one lie was thinking of buying, took
the notion of trying a race with the wind.
I never went so fast before, and I suppose I
may venture to say I never want to go such
a pace again. All's well that ends well,
though, as I feel quite sure I could not have
dropped into better quarters. I thought I
had not much to learn in the matter of horseflesh,
but the old gentleman has given me a
wrinkle or two.

I had no doubt but that you would get
Sudlow to terms. It is a sort of thing far more
in your line than mine. You don't say how you
managed to screw him up, but so long as he
is screwed the modus operandi signifies little.
Yes, you arrange about the wedding as you
like. I can't come up for it, but I wrote to
the Canon to know if he wouldn't tie the
knot P ' You had best let bygones be
bygones,' I said, ' peace and goodwill in
families is both politic and Christian. My
daughter is making a capital match, and it is

always prudent to cultivate friendly relations
with a niece who is well off. Peggy is
a confoundedly handsome girl  a girl any
-uncle might be proud of with a rich husband
at her back,' so to cut a long story short the
"Canon will officiate, that is, if you like. I said
I had always kept clear of the faniih quarrels,
water, either cold or lot hoeing a thing quite
out of my line.

"sow the matter rests between you two
brothers ; just do as you please, it makes very
little difference to me. Give Peggy my blessing
 I am afraid she won't care for that much,
but I have nothing else to present her with. I
certainly think she and Sudlow will run in
harness very well together. A selfish man
sought always to marry a selfish woman. This
will sound like a mistake, but it works well
in practice. Entre nous it would have been a
thousand pities to spoil two houses with such
a pair. There is a hard commercial smack
about them both that fills me with astonishment.

If Peg had been different she would
have sent him to the right-about long ago.
If Sudlow had been different I could have
hobbled him last summer.

What a splendid girl poor, dear Susan
has proved herself. Fancy her smuggling that
picture of Delilah out of Hilderton'sstudic.

The young hound !  what a scandalous
thing to paint my daughter's face in such a
connection. He meant to exhibit the painting
somewhere too, and then there would have
been the deuce and all to pay. I am afraid
Peg did not act fairly by the lad. She's an
out-and-out flirt  a dangerous flirt  these
quiet demure women always are. However,
she's met with her match in Sudlow. They
must arrange matters when they are man and
wife. Meanwhile you and I may thank
Heaven we are well out of the whole business.
Directly Peg's matter is settled I shall present
my petition in bankruptcy. Poor girl, she
does not know all her father is going through

for lier sake ! I had thought of having Peg
turned off' at Chelston (the Wookes would
have been only too delighted to stand a wedding
spread at The Pleasaunce) but second
thoughts are best and it seemed to me we
should act prudentia (one ought always to
keep an eye an that future) to play no
triumphal march while the disgustingly
woolly sheep, Sudlow, was led up for sacrifice.

Besides, the Wookes are total abstinence
folks and you know what that means when
the success of a marriage feast is in the
balance.

You have managed splendidly about the
settlements. In confidence I may tell you,
if it had been impossible to get Sudlow upto
the starting post so weighted, I'd have let
Peg take her chance without any settlements
at all. After my first London experience
of her, I knew she would be a most
difficult vouno' woman to ' run,' and I think
we both deserve the highest praise for getting

her married at all ! My letter has been the
work of two mornings. Of your charity
write often, if you can, to this poor ' Exile of
Erin.'

I don't complain. You know I never
complain ; still there is no denying the fact
that solitary confinement in the height of the
London season is rough on

Yours faithfully,

Geoffrey Chelston.

'P.S.  One little suggestion. Don't you
think it might be well to pay that milliner's
bill of Peg's? Of course I want to put
it in my schedule ; but if I do I'm afraid
Madame Rosalie will apply to Sudlow for
it, and kick up no end of a row, in the
event of his Lot paying her, and whether he
paid her or not he would make things confoundedly
unpleasant for the girl.

If you agree with me I am sure you will
do what I can't, namely, settle with Madame K.

As you are acting so generously about the
bridal rig-out all could be paid under one
head, and it will be the last thing you will
ever have to do for Peg. Tell Susan, by the
time her execution morning comes, I mean to
be well enough to act as father.

I am so glad about Dane. As I always
said no better fellow ever breathed, and from
the ver' first I felt sure his innocence would
be proved. When you are amongst jewellers
I wish you would choose some pretty trifle
and send it with the enclosed to Susan. I'll
square that account with you out of the veris
first bit of luck which comes in my way.

G. C."

Mr. Gayre felt inside the envelope for the
enclosure mentioned. It proved to be a slip
of paper on which were written the words,.
"From Papa Geoff."

For a short time Sir Geoffrey's brother-in-law
sat contemplating this epistle Avitli a sort
amazed admiration. There had been a

period when it would have maddened him,
but that period was past, and he couki now
regard Sir Geoffrey dispassionately as a
person upon whose like it seemed most
improbable he should ever look again.

Besides the letter was almost an epitome of
the events which had occurred within the
space of little over a year. Was it really
something less than fifteen months since that
day when he sauntered idly across the grass in
Hyde Park, and saw Sudlow leaning over the
rails? Why, those months seemed to him a
whole existence. He had nearly lived a life
in the time. What a sermon it all was on
the vanity of human hopes, and on the uselessness
of mortal projects. What a satire to
be commissioned by Papa Geoff, to buy a
wedding gift it was intended he himself should
pay for, to present to the woman he loved!

I thought to manage Sir Geoffrey," he
considered, " and Sir Geoffrey has managed
me. I wonder if he will outwit his new

Vol. iii. 66

friend Mr. Sponner. Nothing more likely.
And what about Mrs. Fits-Hugh when Mr.
FitzHugh goes out of business, and relinquishes
whist and leaves her a widow?
Humph," and Mr. Gayre, lighting a match,
applied it to the baronet's letter and watched
the precious missive burn to dust on the
hearth.

Whatever his faults, and he had many, the
banker was not really mean. All his instincts
led him to loyalty, for which reason he did not
docket and pigeon-hole his brother-in-law's
epistle and consider " This may prove useful
some day."

What he did, however, consider was that he
wished he had not to go to Chislehurst in
order to spend a " nice, quiet, comfortable
afternoon." He was forced to spend many
such afternoons at The Warren and they
filled his soul with a terrible despair. Wliat
should he do when he was married and life
became a series of such afternoons ? Already

Susan was avenged. Never had lie shrunk
with greater horror from the idea of passing
existence with him than he recoiled from
the notion of spending the years " fev>- and
evil " which might be in store for him with
Mrs. Jubbins.

It was the old Brunswick Square business
over again. She had changed the venue,
but the pleadings were the same. He never
for half-an-hour together o't out of the
Jones, Brown and Robinson set. Deputy
Pettell and others of that connection literally
:swarmed upon the carpet. Their houses,
their furniture, their carriages, their servants,
their friends, their parties, their travels, their
sayings, their doings  was he never, till death
brought peace, to hear any other sort of
conversation? Talk of moulding Mrs. Gubbins
! He might as well have thought of
making her a girl again or of cutting downier
goodly proportions to the airy symmetry

of a Hebe! Endurance was the only thing

66-2

left for him, and to do Mr. Gayre justice he
did bear the eternal flow of talk about
nothing with saintlike equanimity. He had
sold himself for a mess of pottage and he
would have to wear the chains of his
captivity, though they galled his flesh and ate
into his very soul. Already there had been a
few differences of opinion, in all of which
Mrs. Jubbins marched off the field with a
grand composure in the character of conqueror.
She would have felt greatly surprised
had anyone told her she was or
wanted to be a conqueror ; she honestly
believed she was deferring to Mr. Gayre in
all things. It is difficult for a woman whose
first husband has made an idol of her,
and whose widowhood has proved a long
career of doing exactly what she liked, to
understand her ways and ideas or even her
manners and habits can possibly be uncongenial
to any one who wishes to marry her.
Mrs. Jubbins had fallen into the not

uncommon mistake of imagining that all she
did, and all she had, stood far above the
vulgar height, where holes could be picked
in either her doings or belonerino-s. She had
her own notions and of course those notions
were right. She had her possessions and
those possessions in her opinion were
precisely the proper possessions. She wished
to live in town, and as a natural consequence
it was ridiculous to suppose Mr. Gayre could
really prefer the country. He knew nothing
about the country, and she did ; she had
lived in it for a whole year and was deadly
tired of it ; he had not lived in it at all, if
he had he would be tired of it too. This
was Mrs. Jubbins mode of reasoning, and it
is unnecessary to state that the result of
discussion future arrangements with Mr.
Oa}Te invariably ended in his apparent conversion
to her views ; considering what Mrs.
Jubbins had done for him he would have
been most ungrateful to insist he had any

right to maintain his own opinions, but the
banker sometimes thought he should like to
know whether he might ever be permitted
to have an opinion at all. It was very well
for Mrs. Jubbins to say, as she did say continually,
" I want to consult you." But it was
scarcely so agreeable to find that these
consultations meant well-nigh interminable
talks about what the lady wanted to do.

Mr. Gayre knew perfectly well no better
nor kinder woman than Mrs. Jubbins, so far
as her light went, ever existed, but he also
knew she would wear, and was indeed wearing,
him to death.

There were things about her which reo



minded him constantly of his father. He could
not forget the monotonous round of small
interests, petty details, contemptible gossip,
and narrow ideas which made Brunswick
Square more irksome to him than narrow
cell ever seemed to prisoner. Then he
could not say, "My mind to me a kingdom

is," for he often felt this mind was stultifying
while he listened to the even flow of babble
that did duty for conversation in Mrs.
Jubbins' house.

Could he face the prospect of being
cooped up in a town house with that eternal
trickle of twaddle always running through
his ears ; with the Petrels, and the Jones, and
others of the same ilk, for his only home
society ; with his old friends banished to
his club  for he could not no, he felt he
could not  invite men whose ideas were
cosmopolitan, who had travelled, and thought,
and read, and seen life, understanding the
phrase in its best and widest sense ; to
come and listen to discussions concerning
the amount Mr. Robinson's " mansion " at
Walton had cost to build, or the questionable
taste of Mrs. Brown, who having been
taken up by a" grand High Church set," had
so far forgotten what her poor papa's ideas
of Popery were, as to go to early service

and walk about the West End clad in
hodden grey, and wearing a close bonnet
made of brown straw, just as if she were
the wife of a clerk in the receipt of thirty
shillings a week.

Further he could not disguise the fact that
antagonistic as Mrs. Jubbins might be to him,
she was beginning to feel him even more
antagonistic to her.

Honestly, he meant to make her an excellent
husband ; but he had no intention of
being a foolish one I At the first offset it
was clearly understood marriage should not
be thought of till sufficient time had elapsed
to enable him to release his own capital, and
finally put matters between him and his
future wife on some business and tangible
footing. For a time this arrangement worked
admirably but it could not last for ever, and
with dismay Mr. Gayre found himself expected
to play the part of lover to a lady he
had known ever since she wore short frocks.

and blue sallies  and whom lie should certainly
have thought old enough to know
better. Something of the awe she formerly
felt for him still remained ; but it was wearing
away. No later than the occasion of his last
visit to Chislehurst, she entered through the
open window near which he was seated in
order to ask him some question, and in the
most simple and natural manner came behind
his chair, put a hand on each shoulder and
called him " dear''

Mr. Gayre thought of this experience with
a shudder. He recalled the sudden chill her
action had sent through him, and earnestly
trusted the 2ood, generous soul felt nothings
of the deadly tremor which for a moment
turned his strength into weakness.

He could not draw back now. In honour,
in common honesty, he was forced to go on.
As long as he could make the woman who
trusted him happy and content, what did it
signify how wretched he felt ? He had been

placed in a sore strait  on the one side lay
the Scylla of poverty, on the other the
Charybdis of an uncongenial marriage.

Matrimony was the only interest Mrs.
Jubbins Avonld have accepted and that he
could laye offered for the use of her fortune.
Yes, looking back he could see no other
course possible for him to pursue. Given
that he dared not face bankruptcy, no
resource remained but to marry the relict
of Mr. Jubbins. The position did not bear
thinking about, so deciding not to think about
it Mr. Gayre put aside his papers and started
for Chislehurst,

He found Mrs. Jubbins arrayed in a yer}
pretty summer dress, which did not become
her in the least. Susan or his niece would
laye looked lovely in it ; but the soft floy
of the light material, and the cunning
of delicate colours, were death
to Mrs. Jubbins' mature charms. Nevertheless,
he had to say something about her

attire, and he spoke a few words of compliment
with such grace as he could assume.
That was the first event of an afternoon
he will never forget as long as he keeps
his memory. From the first moment things
went on steadily chafing his spirit and
finally inducing such a state of irritability,
that finally addressing one of Mrs. Jubbins'
young people in a tone of sharp decision,
he said, " Don't be so rude, sire"' Mrs.
Jubbins' offspring were, as a rule, extremely
rude  but no one had ever ventured to tell
them so before, and the lad stared at
the banker ere, turning on his heel, he
walked out of the room, whistling defiantly.
Mrs. Jubbins looked at Mr. Gayre, and
Mr. Gayre looked at Mrs. Jubbins  but
neither spoke. The boy had been offensively
impertinent ; even a mother's partiality
couldn't deny that fact. Mr. Gayre regretted
his hasty speech, but felt he ought not to
apologize. He waited for Mrs. Jubbins to

make some remark, but to this surprise and
relief lie took no verbal notice of what
lead occurred.

Instead, she began to talk of The Warren,
and her wish to return to town.

''I have been thinking," she said, "that
I should like to take a house somewhere
in the Kensington direction. I do not
care much for Palace Gardens, though the
houses there are good, and of course it is
nice to look out on the Park. I prefer
Camden Hill. I really do not think I
should object to Camden Hill."

You have quite decided, then, not to
return to Brunswick Square ? "

Quite  the neighbourhood, you see, has
so altered its character. Besides, the
lease has not long to run, and I feel sure
Mr. Rotten would be glad to take it for
the remainder of my term."

"And I had a letter this morning from
an old Indian friend, who is coming home

on leave for eighteen months, asking me
to look out a place for him within twelve
miles of town. The Warren would, I know,
suit him exactly."

I am so glad. I have taken it on for
another year, and 1 should not like to
be under two rents."

That is a thing to be avoided, certainly,"
and then there ensued another silence. Mr.
Gayre felt he was spending a very quiet
afternoon indeed.

Shall we take a turn through the
grounds ? " asked Mrs. Jubbins, " the gardens
are looking beautiful. As Mrs. Gibson
was saying only yesterday, they do Hole
very great credit indeed."

As he had observed, a score of times
before, Mr. Gayre again observed there could
be no doubt but that Holditch understood
his business.

' I must just get a parasol, so we may as
well go through the hall," and accordingly

they passed through the hall, where Mr.
Gayre had seen Susan sitting amongst the
showers on that night which seemed so long
and long ago.

As though she had known of what he was
thinking Mrs. Jubbins, directly they got upon
the gravelled walk leading down the hill-side
on which the gardens lay, began,

That dear Miss Drummond was here
the other day ; she came to say good-bye."

Why, where is she going ? " asked Mr.
Oayre.

To her cousin's, to the place where she
spent her girlhood. She is to be married
from there ; did you not know ? "

I did know something of it, but I had
forgotten. How is she looking ? "

"-' Radiantly happy; poor thing, I am so
sorry for her ! "

"Sorry! Why?"

Oh, because she icill marry that young
man, and what can be in store for her but

misery. Nobody will ever believe in this
innocence, and even supposing lie had been
innocent when he was sent to that dreadful
place, how can he be fit for any nice woman
to associate with after livings among' thieves
and murderers and, as Deputy Pettell calls
them, the very scum of the population ? "

I do not think we need discuss that
question again," suggested Mr. Gayre, who
had heard it discussed till he was tired.

Then they have so little money ; nothing,
I assure you, but the trifle she has
left out of her own small fortune."

"They have a great deal of love,
though."

"But, good gracious, people can't live
entirely on love ! and after all I am afraid,
though I did not say so to her, there is
much more love on the one side than on
the other. I shall never feel quite satisfied
about that business of Miss Colvend. If
lie had not paid attentions to the young

lady, of course, she would never have
thought of getting so violently fond of
him."

You must understand such matters
better than I," said Mr. Gayre, humbly.

And I have not patience with his folly
in refusing to accept compensation from
Mr. Colvend. He says it would look as if
he were being bought off  like taking hush
money. So ridiculous ! ' He ought to take
all he can for your sake, my dear,' I told
her, but she wouldn't see it. Her cousin
means to try and get lira an appointment,
but I suppose he can only expect some
paltry salary."

"I rejoice to hear she is looking welland
happy."

"Yes, but I am afraid that won't last. She
spoke very gratefully about you, though
not so gratefully as I consider she ought,
considering the enormous trouble you gave
yourself over Mr. Dane's affair."

"I only wish I lead been able to do more
and do it sooner," he answered. " Ah I there
fifes Joshua ! Did you see how he turned
back the moment he saw us ? He hasn't forgiven
me yet for telling him not to be rude."

"Xo, poor boy ; you see my children have
never been spoken to in that way."

If you really think I went beyond the
limit of what I ought to have said I suppose
I ought to apologise."

"Xo, no, don't think of such a thing,"
said ]airs. Julius, hurriedly, "you did not
mean to vex me, only  only  you scarcely
understand  you have not been accustomed
to young people and, besides  "

He looked at her inquiringly, as she paused
and coloured violently. " I fear I have
annoyed you even more than I thought," he
said, " Believe me, I had not the slightest
idea ray remark would wound you in anyway.
I am very sorry. You know if there
be one person in the world whose feelings I

Vol. iii. 07

should consider more than another, that
person is yourself."

She made a little sign to ask him to stop ;
then, all of a sudden turning and beginning
to retrace her steps, she murmured in a
voice so low he could scarcely catch her
tones,

I want to speak to you ; let us go and
sit under the ash trees ; we shall not be
interrupted there."

Mr. Gayre assented, wondering greatly.
He had not understood an inexplicable
change in her manner, which he noticed from
the first moment she greeted him. What
could she be going to say? He racked his
brain to imagine what had happened.

Afterwards he remembered each detail of
that interview, could recall the way the
sunbeams lay athwart the road ; could seethe
trembling of the leaves, feel again the
touch of the gentle wind which lightly
swayed the branches, but just at that moment

all sense of observation seemed swallowed
up in amazement.

It is no use beating about the bush,"
she began, and her voice was not quite
steady. "I will tell you at once what I
have been thinking. AVe must never marry 
our engagement must end."

"Why?" he asked.

"The last two months have been very
pleasant to me," she went on, unheeding his
question ; " one week out of them I may
say was the happiest in all my life. \lien
I look back I can never remember a time
when I did not care for you ; when I was a
girl you were the hero of my imagination,
the ideal man of all my girlish dreams."

He was about to speak but she laid her
hand on his, as a token she did not want him
to do so.

When I was left a widow and my mother
told me your father wished you and me to
marry I felt life almost too happy ; I forgot

my dead husband and all he had done forme
and mme, and thought of you and you
only. I am not ashamed to tell you this
now," she proceeded, after the slightest
break ; " because it is all past and done with ;
we will, I hope, be good friends for ever ;
but I have thought matters over, and know
it is best we should be nothing more."

"May I again ask you why  I shall not
try to influence your decision, but if not
disagreeable, I wish you would tell me

CD ' ./

the causes which have induced you to
arrive at it."

I will tell you as well as I can. First
of all, the conviction has been growing
upon me, for a long time, that we were
unfitted for each other-sit is no sudden
fancy of mine  that we should never be
quite happy together. You have your
notions and I have mine, and we could not
make them agree. Even in upholstery,
the things I like you don't like  and it is

the same in other matters. That we insight
o-et over thoui>-h ; but what I never could
get reconciled to is that you do not care
for me  really. If you ever had cared forme
you would have said so, years ago  "

Passionate attachment," he urged, "can
perhaps scarcely be expected from a man
of my age but  "

"Yes, I understand all that," she interrupted,
" but I should not feel satisfied.
I know now, why, at times, lately I have
been so unsettled and miserable  yes,
miserable  even while I believed myself
happy  but there is more still. I have
yet another reason  "

I must indeed be a heinous criminal,"
he remarked, with a faint smile.

Xo," she said, " you are not to blame
at all, the fault is entirely my own. I
have no right to marry  anybody. My
husband left me in charge of a great trust,
and I ought to try to be worthy of it.

How could I do justice to this children and
to you. I never thought of marrying anybody
but you  and I shall never think of
marrying again. I mean to live for my
sons and my daughters, and to be what
your father once said I was  a faithful
steward."

It is perhaps quite as well, then, that I
spoke to Joshua as I did to-day; otherwise,
you might not have found out your duty
till it was too late," said Mr. Gay re.

Yes, I should. I had found it out, and
what do you think shoved it to me ? "

' I would really rather not hazard any
conjecture."

"Miss Drummond."

'why, what did she say?"

She said nothing, except two words.
I'll tell you lioAv it happened. When we
were talking together, and she Alas speaking
about how happy she was, I could not
help telling her I was very happy too. I

forgot, for the moment, you and I had agreed
to let no one know how affairs stood for
the present and I went on  ' I am gong
to marry a man I have loved all my life;
your friend, Mr. Gayre.' I assure you, it
slipped out quite accidentally."

Yes, and then  "

She repeated " J//\ Garret'' just like
that, in an incredulous sort of tone  yet still
IS if she was shocked  and I shall never
:beget the look in her face, like some one who
could scarcely believe her ears. Then she
recovered herself and said, prettily, she wished
us all sorts of happiness  but the wa' she
cried out Mr. Gayre, and her startled
expression, have haunted me ever since. I
could not close my eyes last night, I felt
so wretched, and then when you spoke to
Joshua as you did, I knew it was best we
should (consider everything at an end. As
for the money, don't trouble yourself about
that  keep it as long as you like  I always

knew you would not wrong me or my
children of a penny  but lending money is
one thing and marrying another ; and noah say
you are not angry with me, and that we shall
never cease to be friends?"

'mrs. Jubbins, I never respected or admired
you so much as I do at this moment
and I shall always be your devoted friend,"
said Mr. Gayre  and it is only right to ache
spoke from his heart.

Relief ! " Was that any word to express
the load taken from his heart ? As he r
turned to town that night he felt yer
humble, very penitent, very thankful.
Heaven has been more merciful to me
than I deserve," he thought, and who can
deny but that there was a considerable
amount of truth in the observation.

Conclusion.

whitsuntide 1877. May once again,
:5? for the third time, since that
morning when Mr. Gayre stood beside
the railings in Hyde Park, and watched
Margaret Chelston's meeting with the
"fairest of fair women."

London was virtually deserted. On the
previous Saturday London had dispatched
lier hundreds, and tens of hundreds, her
millions, indeed, into the quiet country, to
the seashore, and the continent. On
Monday morning there was not a street
situated hi as low and poor neighbourhood
a district visitor could name, but found
means to raise enough money to charter

some sort of conveyance and proceed behind
wretched horses that inst long previously
Have learned to curse the sound of a
cornopean, to such places of resort as
represent fun and fashion to the excursions
mind. The great Metropolis was like a
city of the dead. Round and about the
Royal Exchange many commercial corpses
lay awaiting burial, but the ceremony being
(compulsory delayed till after Bank Holiday,
the men whose cheques and bills had
been dishonoured were waiting? in suburban
villas and great West End mansions,
for some miracle to happen in the interval
which should enable them to begin the
struggle of business life afresh on the
Tuesday folio vdng Pentecost.

In the streets scarcely a human being
was to be met with  cabman recognising a
possible fare afar off hailed him with
effusion : a few country cousins wandered
four abreast along the pavements without

getting " shouldered " for their pains ; lads
who had no pennies wherewith to pay
train or tram fares, tied white woollen
.scarves tightly round their throats, and started
to walk for the nearest places where stickle-hacks
could be fished for, or the pleasing
.sport of seeing starved donkeys being
thrashed by brutes armed with heavy
sticks witnessed. Scarce a soul was abroad.
The better classes who were forced to
remain in town kept close within doors ;
on the railways all distinctions of class
were virtually abolished ; it was possible
to walk from Temple Bar to Lydgate
Circus down the middle of the horse-road';
the West End conveyed a pleasing impression
of rustic seclusion ; men walked to their
clubs as if a large balance of the seventy
allotted years remained in which to stroll
along the shady side of the street ; in the
home counties rhododendrons and early roses,
hawthorn, laburnum, lilac, a thousand wildflowers

 yellow buttercups, meek-eyed daisies
springing grass  girt London round with a
natural belt of emerald green, gemmed by
a thousand stars of divine hues, such as no
astronomer, no jeweller, ever, out of his own
consciousness, could have imagined.

In the hedgerows, by the wayside, flowers
were springing, blooming, dying. It was an
early year, and in London a May sun positively
beamed upon its inhabitants. There
were not many belonging to the better condition
of life remaining to be beamed on ;
still one man, well-considered and reputed
to be wealthy, was walking down Duke
Street, St. James', on his way to Victoria
Station.

The quietest of quiet pedestrians, the
sedate of sedate gentlemen ! Certainly not
very young, presumably not very old, a clean-cut,
closely-shaved, military-looking sort of
person, who might have been anybody, from
peer to poet, but who happened to belong

neither to the Upper Ten nor to the dear
Bohemia.

Suddenly the silence of the West End
street was rent with,

"Gayre, Gayre I Hill ! Hill I " and
Gayre, for so the gentleman was named,
turning round, beheld a figure on the
opposite side of the way, making frantic signs
for him to stop.

Ah ! you remember me," this individual
said, as they shook hands in the middle of
the horse-road. " Gad, you are looking' well.
Years, I vow, run by and leave you younger."

Why, Sir Geoffrey, I did not expect to
meet you here."

And, by Jove, I did not expect to meet
you. Just see here, Gayre," and the baronet
affectionately passed his arm through that of
his brother-in-law, as if they were the dearest
of dear friends, "I swear it is like water in a
thirsty land to look on your pleasant face
again. I am glad to have even this glimpse

of YOU. I called at Sudlow's, but, faith, I
found such cold welcome there I was glad
to return to mine inn."

They are not a very genial pair, certainly."


Neo, but you remember what I always
said. I mayn't be a very sharp fellow,
but I'm the very deuce in the wa' of
prophecy. I always knew they would suit
each other to a T. Lord, how she did goon
about my marriage."

' You hold your tongue, my girl,' I said,
there was trouble enough to get you
married.' That shut Iter up."

And how is your wife ? " asked Mr
Gay re. For . answer his brother-in-law
pulled a newspaper from his pocket 
smoothed it carefully over his knee  turned
to the first page, folded it up so as to leave
the " births " outside, and pointed out one
especial paragraph for perusal.

The paragraph ran thus 

"At Brockborougli, near Doncaster, the
-wife of Sir Geoffrey Chelston, Baronet, of
a son and heir."

It is all their own composition," explained
the happy father. " Gad, I Irish they'd 
an heir, but I'm nobody now, of course.
I came up to town to be clear of the fuss
Old Sponner is just out of his senses with
delight at being grandfather to an embryo
baronet."

"I am sure I congratulate you all very
heartily."

"It's more than Peggy did. I said, 'It's
of no use your turning up your nose; you'd
better by far be civil to the young stranger.
He is born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
He'll have lots of money when he comes of
age. Old Sponner swears he shall have all
his money, and his mother says shell see I
have no chance of touching it. By-the-bye,.
I stopped a night at Susan s on my way up.
She's got a jolly little girl, and she is prettier

than ever  and as foi' Dane  lie's fairly
crazy about her. You'd think no man ever
owned a wife before. She's just the same as
she used to be, only a little quieter. I think
she can't quite forget all that trouble. She
is the best creature ! She persuaded Lai
Hilderton to leave London, and he lives in a
cottage on the estate, with Sue's old nurse
to cook his meals and mend his socks. He's
doing real good work, I hear  don't profess
to care for that sort of tliino' myself!
Weren't you surprised to hear Dane had got
his grandfather's property? Good job the
miserly old sinner could never make up this
mind to sign a will. Well, they are a very
happy pair  as happy a pair as 3'ou'd wish
to see. I often wonder you never married,
Gayre, but perhaps you're as well as you are
women as a rule are a confounded lot of
trouble."

"I am sorry you think so, for I have
asked one to take care of me."

Who is it Mrs. Jubbins ? "

Mrs. Jubbins will never marry anybody.
Xo, this is the daughter of a man who was
my superior officer when I first entered the
army. She is a charming girl, or rather
woman, for she is nearly thirty, and
I hope and believe we are exactly suited to
each other. Her father leaves for India
before the end of the summer, and then we
shall take up our residence permanently at
The Warren. You recollect Mrs. Jubbins'
hearty there ? "

"Eather," said Sir Geoffrey. " Well, I'm
heartily glad to hear this, my boy  and whenever
you're ready, only let me know and I'll
'some and look you up. Gad. you've decided
on a sweet place. I am more pleased than I
<:an tell you to think you are going to live
at The Warren  always thought that dear
good creature, Mrs. Jubbins, was the wrong
thing in the right place there. Money's
not everything  that's what I say a dozen

times a week ; but I can't get the set I've
got mixed up with to believe me."

You have quite recovered from your
accident ? "

Yes, quite, thank you  leg's a bit stiff still,
but I can ride as well as ever, Heaven be
praised  don't know what would become of
me if I couldn't. By-the-bye, I was deucedly
glad to hear you are allowing interest on
balances now. I can send you lots of accounts,
and I don't want a penny of commission.
Yes, indeed, it was quite a surprise tome
to hear some fellows saying, the other day,
the old Tortoise might chance to outstrip some
new hares yet. There's Graceless ! I must be
off. Hi ! Gayre, just one thing more. Mark
ni} words. You'll see that youngster wont be
able to drink a drop of anything stronger than
water. I know he'll turn out a regular milksop.
Shouldn't wonder if they make a parson
of him. The Reverend Sir Ferdinand Shelton.
Baronet. You'll find that's what it will be

Ferdinand is this mother's selection. Well,
good-bye, don't quite forget me."

The banker stood looking after Sir
Geoffrey's retreating figure for a few minutes;
his legs were a little more bowed and his hat a
little more on one side than usual, but otherwise
there was no change in his appearance.

Forget you "  thought Mr. Gayre as he
turned away  " Never ! "
