CHAPTER I.

A FRIEND IN NEED.

And as Mr. Eobert Jarrett continued to
stare, lie suddenly woke to the consciousness
that the young lady, whoever she
might be, possessed a very charming face.
A face soft, and fresh, and fair ; round inform,
delicate in colouring, and beautified
by a pair of clear gray eyes, fringed with
long dark eye-lashes, whose straightforward
and honest expression was attractive in the
extreme.

She reddened imperceptibly at his somewhat
prolonged scrutiny. Then finding
he did not reply to her offer of assistance,

VOL. II. 17

she broke into a little laujzh, and said

liflitlv :

Ah ! I see you think I am makini] a
vain boast, in offering to help you out of
your present dilemma, but the difficulty is
by no means as great as it seems."

It has puzzled me for some time," said
Bob, wiping his damp brow with a silk
pocket-handkerchief. " I never saw such
a orate in my life."

She laughed again, merrily like a little
child, and clapped her hands together.

Ah ! YOU are not the first gentleman
who has been similarly baffled. Indeed,
I often tell Farmer Budge quite seriously
that he ought to put up a notice, giving
full directions as to how his gates open,
but he declares this is precisely what he
does not want. Now, look here and I will
show you the secret. There ! do you see ? "
and stooping' down from the saddle, she
pressed a small iron knob, imbedded in the

wood at the very end of the latch, and
which Bob in his impatience had entirely
overlooked.

The gate immediately Hew open.

It is quite simple once you know
the way," she said with a smile of amusement.


' Like a food many other thinf][s," he
remarked, as he led The Swell on to the
road.

"These latches were exhibited at the
last Agricultural Show, I believe," she
went on, talking naturally and easily.
"Farmer Budge has taken out a patent
and claims to be the inventor. He is very
proud of them, but all the hunting gentlemen
are loud in their condemnation."

' I don't wonder. They are diabolical

things, and I really can't think what would

have become of me if you had not just

happened to appear when you did."

And yet you looked a little *



appointed, at least judging from the expression
of your face," she said archly.

Bob blushed. He had no idea that his
countenance had betrayed him, or that she
would prove so discerning.

IIow sharp you are. Well, I will not
deny the truth. I was a little disappointed,
because I thought it had come to be a
regular case of brute force, which would
require a couple of men's strength."

Whereas female cunning has answered
the purpose as well," she retorted gaily.

It has answered the purpose so far,
that I cannot help feeling I owe you an
immense debt of gratitude."

And as he spoke, he caught hold of The
Swell's mane, hoisted himself into the
saddle, and moved on a pace or two.

His companion, whose way was apparently
identical, instead of wishing him
good-bye, continued to ride by his side.
She was not very smartly dressed, not

nearly as smartly as Lady De Eoclisey.
Her plain black habit showed symptoms of
wear. It had a large leather patch over
the knee, and the seams were decidedly
threadbare ; but for all that, Bob thought
there was no comparison between the two
women. With the one, every tone, every
action, was evidently studied ; with the
other, a freedom from all self-consciousness
gave her an undefinable charm, which he
felt before he had been two minutes in her
presence.

Oh ! " she exclaimed ; " how dreadfully
lame your poor horse is. What is the
matter with him ? "

I don't know," answered Bob. "But
I can't get him along at all."

You shouldn't try to," she said reproachfully,
as he endeavoured to increase
the speed. " If you do, you deserve to betaken
up for cruelty to animals."

It would not matter if it were not

SO infernally cold," he rejoined w'itli a
shiver.

She looked up at him with an air of true
feminine pity, which sank deep into the
foolish fellow's heart. All through the
day that particular organ had. been
hardening and hardening, until at last it
felt like a stone. One single glance from a
pretty, fresh-faced, young woman made a
curious difference in his sensations. It was
so. sweet to find that somebody sympathised
in his misfortunes, instead of turning them
into ridicule. A lump came into his throat,
as her soft, compassionate eyes rested upon
him.

*' Did you meet with an accident ? " she
asked commiserating.

It was as if he could not tell her an
untruth, or even conceal his shortcomings.


I tumbled off into a brook. Mv horse
stopped short, and I Hew over his head.

No doubt I ought not to have quitted the
pigskin, but I did."

He spoke with a kind of defiant doggedness,
which betrayed a secret fear that she
might laugh at him. Apparently nothing
was further from her intentions. She had
laughed merrily enough a few moments
ago. He had only thought to himself how
pure and childlike her mirth sounded.
But now her little flower-like face, with its
large eyes and rose-bud mouth, looked very
grave and sedate.

"Everybody comes off when they ought
not to," she said consolingly. " We think
nothing of such small casualties down
here. Why ! the very best rider in all
the Hunt  a poor man who was killed
only the other day, Hew off last season
before the whole field, without any
apparent reason. But tell me, have you
far to go ? Because if so, we could change
saddles, and I might lend you my dear old

Mouse to ride home upon. You 'v'ould get
there sooner."

Bob was quite affected by the kindness
of this proposal, coming as it did from a
complete stranger.

And you  what would you do ? " he
said after a slight pause.

I ? Oh ! I should put your horse into
our stable, and let the poor thing remain
there till you send for him. How much
further have you to ao ? " returning to her
point.

I really haven't an idea. I'm a stranger,
and have never hunted here before
to-day."

' Will you tell me, then, for what place
you are bound ? I know most of the
distances pretty accurately, having lived
in this part of the world nearly all my
life."

I am bound for Straighten Court "said
Bob in reply. "

Lie gave a little start.

Then you are Mr. Jarrett ! I thought
as much."

Did you ? How was that ? " he asked
with awakening curiosity.

"Because I know the greater number
of the regular habitues of our hunt, at all
events by sight."

"Don't you think," said Bob, "that
since I have told you my name, you might
as well tell me yours ; it's always more
comfortable to know who people are."

If it would add to your comfort in anyway,
Mr. Jarrett," she replied jestingly, " I
have great pleasure in informing you that
my name is Dot." And two mischievous
dimples appeared in either cheek.

Dot ! " he repeated, lingering unconsciously
on the word. "What is Dot
short for ? "

Dorothea. Being a rather small person,
I was presented with a very grand name.

But as everybody seems to find it rather a
mouthful, it has been reduced to Dot."

"Dot what? I rather like Dot," and
Bob stole a glance at her ; " but I suppose
you have a surname like all the rest of the
world."

Oh ! yes, Lankester. But let me introduce
myself formally. Miss Dorothea
Lankester, only daughter of Doctor Hugh
Lankester, who enjoys the privilege and
distinction of dispensing nostrums to the
good people in your village. When you
require medical aid, Mr. Jarrett, please
think of us." And she turned a pair of
laughing gray eyes full upon him."

Would you come to nurse me ? " he
asked, chiming in with her mood.

"I should have to. Ko choice would be
given me in the matter. So mind and
don't fall ill. I always say that I would
rather attend to a dozen women than one
man''

Why ? I should have thought it would
have been the other way about."

Because the men have not got a bit of
pluck, and give in at once. They always
make up their minds that they are going
to die, even if they only cut their finger,
whereas women are so used to discomfort
and physical pain, that they bear even the
most dreadful sufferings with stoicism."

'' I shouldn't mind putting up with a
good deal of discomfort to be nursed by
you," said Bob, still harping on the same
idea, and getting bolder as he began to feel
more at ease.

Oh ! no, you wouldn't." And she
pursed up her little face till it wore a
comically severe expression. " I'm an
awfully strict nurse and keep my patients
in thorough order."

I hope we shall see a great deal
of each other," he said, visions of neighbourly
visits, pleasant dinners, and delightful

country rides with Miss Dot flashing
across his mind's eye. " It will be so nice
for us to be good friends'*

Very," she replied with frank unconsciousness.
" The worst of it is, father is
generally so dreadfully busy, he hardly
ever has a moment to himself. He was
only saying to-da}-. that really we ought to
call upon you."

Who are we ? " asked Bob, artfully
endeavouring to find out of how many
members the family of Miss Lankester
consisted.

Mother and me. Father very seldom
is able to come with us when we leave his
paste-boards."

"Don't pay me a formal visit," he
said eagerly. " I do so hate them. And
and  what day may I expect you ?" He
was making great strides towards intimacy.
Somehow he felt as if he had known her
all his life.

I really can't say exactly, Mr. Jarrett."
lie replied, smiling at his impressment.

Come any non-hunting day. Tuesday,
for instance. That's tomorrow, isn't it ? "

Very well, I'll ask mother."

Wait a bit, though. Why not come to
dinner ? " urged hospitable Bob. "It
"would be ever so much jollier." Then,
with a sudden burst of confidence, inspired
by Miss Dot's sympathetic manner, he
added plaintively : " I can't tell you how
lonely I've been all this time. It will be a
perfect godsend to me to have somebody
to talk to."

Don't you find everybody remarkably
talkative out hunting ? " asked Dot, mischievously.


No, very much the reverse. They
seem a rum lot of fellows, at least according
to my way of thinking. I never met a
duller, solemn set in my life."

Dot's clear laufh ram? out. It did him

good to hear it. There was something so
genuine and so hearty about her laughter.

Ah ! " she exclaimed, " I perceive that
either directly or indirectly you have been
making the acquaintance of some of our
great people."

Yes," he said, savagely, " they are
very great, at all events in their own
estimation. As for me, I confess I cannot
see wherein lies their superiority over the
rest of mankind. They are intolerably rude
and entirely wanting in good manners."

Then he checked himself suddenly, feeling
that he might possibly be committing
an indiscretion, and that it was scarcely
wise to abuse folk with whom Miss Lankester
was probably well acquainted. For
all he knew, they were perhaps personal
friends of hers.

Forgive me," he said, turning crimson.
I was foroettincf that I miirht be hurting?

Your feelings.

J>

Lie smiled brightly, and when she smiled
Bob could not account for the attraction
her face possessed. With the exception of
the eyes, it owned no really striking feature,
and yet he admired and liked her more
than any girl he had ever seen. His own
sisters were ofood-lookin], but there was a
subtle refinement about Miss Lankester
which he felt was wanting? in their case.
Nevertheless, it was hard to define the
difference. As for Lady de Fochsey, she
seemed positively vulgar in comparison.

Pray don't have any fear of hurting
my feelings," said Dot, with just a touch of
satire audible in her clear young voice.
We are only small fry ; and such exalted
personages as the Mutual Adorationites do
not even condescend to know us. We
regard their many virtues from a distance
"

The greater the better," he interrupted.
But," she went on, more seriously.

you must not condemn all Englishmen
from the specimens you may have seen today.
There are some "  and a tender look
illumined all her face  " who don't live
exclusively for their personal pleasure and
consider it the chief and foremost object of
existence  men whose ideal is not mere
amusement, but something worthier and
nobler, and dio see that work and work
alone can brings out the f]rit and substance
of a man's character."

Bob looked at his companion with
growing interest. She spoke enthusiastically,
and her views evidently coincided
with his own. Young as he was, he had
arrived at a philosophy of life which insubstance
was much the same.

You are right, no doubt," he said.
*' And those are the men I thought and
hoped I should meet over here. Perhaps I
expected too much." And he gave a sigh
of disappointment.

"I don't think so. You forget that
those who represent the hunting-field
mostly belong to the rich and consequently
idle class : a class without professions, and
which has no incentive to bring its higher
faculties into play."

They look down upon a fellow," said
Bob bitterly, "because his clothes are
different from their own, because he has
not been born in England, and for a
hundred and one different reasons, equally
trifling. I am sharp enough to know what
they think of me. They think me an
outsider,' and therefore cut me dead. It's
not pleasant being cut. Miss Lankester,"
he concluded pathetically. " One can't
help feeling it, especially when, as in my
case, you have always been brought up to
look upon these men as brothers, and
people of your own kith and kin."

Never mind," said DoL, soothingly.
Things may very likely improve after a
VOL. II 13

bit, and in any case, you must not form
your opinions too hastily. I only wish you
knew a man "

But she stopped short, and did not fish
the sentence. A bright blush rose to her
face, and Bob wondered inwardly what had
caused it, whether some chance word of
Ais had touched any secret chord.

Good-bye, Mr. Jarrett," she said, after
a somewhat prolonged pause, holding out
her hand as she spoke. " Here we are in
the village. You cannot possibly mistake
your way now, since if you go straight on
for another hundred yards you will seethe
elates of Straighten Court. I turn
down here," pointing to a side road that
branched off at right angles from the main
one.

Good-bye," said Bob, reluctantly, detaining
her little gloved hand decidedly
longer than strict politeness demanded.
I'm tremendously obliged to you."

"What for?" she asked, with the innocence
of a child.

Oh ! for ever so much. I felt most
awfully down in the mouth when you
joined me at that beastly gate, regularly
out of sorts all round, but thanks to your
company, I am pounds better already."

I am very glad to hear it, Mr. Jarrett.
Please keep up your spirits, and don't
forget that we English, as a race, are not
so bad as you seem to imagine."

"I except the fair sex," he replied
gallantly. " I think that English women 
especially English girls, are perfectly delightful."


Oh ! so you have made their acquaintance
already, have you ? "

Yes," he answered, raising his hat with
the courtesy of an Elizabethan knight. " I
have met you Miss Lankester. That is
quite enough for me."

Her smooth, pink cheek turned just a

18*

shade pinker, but otherwise she took but
little heed of the implied compliment. It
did not ruffle her calm serenity.

Dot Lankester was not a flirt. Never
did there a girl exist less coquettishly inclined.
The frank simplicity of her nature
prevented her from seeing in every man a
possible lover ; besides, she was content
to remain as she was. In her youth and
innocence she believed firmly in platonic
friendships. She was touched, too, by
Bob's confession of loneliness. She knew
the big house, with its cold, formal rooms,
and retinue of servants  knew it and
shuddered at it. Some are born for
grandeur, some are not. Dot's idea of
happiness was a small abode, little bigger
than a cottage, and two softly-treading
maids to wait upon her. She did not
covet wealth or the pomp of this world.

And so, she could fancy how dull and
how home-sick the young man must feel.

separated from all his relations, living alone
in that great gray old place.

It was not in her power to do much
for him, but what little she could, she
would.

Before you go, do promise faithfully
to come on Tuesday," pleaded Bob, still
holding her hand in his. " Surely you
need not treat me like a stranger or stand
on ceremony."

She withdrew it gently, and with a little
air of quiet dignity, which told him as well
as actual words that he must not attempt
to take any liberties. If they were to befriends,
the limits of their friendship[) must
not be overstrained, especially on so short
an acquaintance.

"Thank sou. I will tell my father and
mother of your kind invitation, and an
answer shall be sent this evening. Will
that do ? " shortening Mouse's reins.

It will have to do," he said, not feeling

wholly satisfied, 3'et afraid to urge the
matter further.

Good-bye, then," she said again, this
time moving away at a fairly brisk trot.

' Good-bye." And cold and wet as Bob
was, he reined in The Swell until Miss
Lankester's girlish form had completely
disappeared from vision.

Coming to him as she had done, in the
midst of his distress  the only person
during all that day who had treated him
kindly and with commiseration  he felt
ready to fall down and worship at her
feet. His imagination magnified a
hundredfold the service she had performed.

So deeply does a little sympathy sink
into the heart of those whose sensibilities
have been outraged and feelings wounded.

At such times a few kind words will
restore a man's self respect and make him
the friend for life of the woman who utters
them.

Only such words are dangerous, from
the very fact that he is apt to think too
much of them and to take them for more
than they are worth.

In Bob's case, he immediately jumped
at the conclusion, that as a specimen of a
fair, frank Eno;iish eirl, utterly devoid of
conceit or affectation, there were not many
who could compare with Miss Dorothea
Lankester.

He had arrived at the age of four-and-twenty,
and, strange to say, had never
been seriously in love. The Australian
maidens had failed to captivate his fancy,
though perhaps the reason might have
partly been that until now he was, not ina
position to marry. Be this as it may,
those five minutes spent in Miss Dot's
society, her gray eyes, and fresh young
face, put some very strange and novel
ideas into his head.

He himself was startled by their presence

and by the suddenness with which they
took form and shape. Only yesterday he
would have been the very readiest to laugh
at such a thin as love at first sii?ht. Today
he was by no means so sure that
it was as idiotic and absurd as he had
hitherto maintained.

First IMPRESSIONS.

Had our friend Bob not had the good
fortune to encounter Dot Lankester when
he did, he would most assuredly have
sunk in the lowest depths of despair on
proceeding to review the results of the
day, to which he had looked forward with
such a large amount of youthful enthusiasm.
Few pleasures equal the anticipation that
they excite. When they do they are too
short-lived to produce any substantial
satisfaction. Only a few brief moments,
snatched from the dreary waste of life
which we fain would lengthen if we could,
but whose very brightness makes the dull
daily path seem darker in comparison.

Every human being lias an .insatiate 
peril aps a selfish  desire for happiness. It
is all very well to philosophize, to preach
wisdom, moderation and content. When
we are first put into the world, and are
young and sanguine, we all of us expect
something from it. We look upon it as a
kind of fairy godmother, who will certainly
grant our wishes and fulfil our desires. It
takes a good many years to learn the
truth, and the learning is seldom pleasant.
Some never learn it. The lesson is too
hard. They cannot understand why,
instead of showering good gifts upon
their children, the world only robs them
of their small possessions, and takes away
with hard covetous hand, faith, hope and
illusion. What then is left ? Little save
endurance. A growing apatli}- which
renders the buffets of Fate a trifle less hard
to bear, and a conviction of the pettiness
of human strivings, when opposed to the

stern, resistless pressure of nature. A
sense of defeat still hunch over Bob. He
was as sore morally as if lie had been
thoroughly thrashed for an uncommitted
offence. Nevertheless the remembrance of
Dot's innocent face, when she had looked
up into his own and offered to lend him
her cob, exercised a wonderfully soothing
effect upon his over-wrought nervous
system.

It contrived to render bearable what
otherwise would have seemed wholly unbearable.
For his heart was full of wrath
when he reflected upon the reception
accorded him by the master of the Morbey
Anstead hounds and his friend General
Prosieboy. It was useless trying to persuade
himself that he did not care. He did
care, and moreover very deeply ; although
he declared inwardly that he was every bit
as food as these men who affected to
despise him. But it was not enough for

him to know the fact, he wanted them to
acknowledge it also. Besides, was he not
their neighbour, and the owner of lands
broad and goodly ? Surely these latter
entitled him to some consideration.

In short, Bob was very angry, almost
as angry as he had been when he had
caught one of his cowboys red-handed in
the act of torturing some cattle. From
that day until this no such volcano had
racked within his breast. He hardly realized
what tumultuous passions he possessed.
But if he was quick-tempered, he was not
vindictive.

By the time he had eaten a good dinner,
comforted the inner man by flesh, and fowl,
and wine, his anger gradually cooled. He
was thoroughly warm again now, having as
soon as the evening meal came to an endo



taken up his quarters in the smallest and
cosiest sitting-room in the house, and
ensconced himself in a luxurious armchair

before a blazing fire, whose blue
and yellow flames shot merrily up the
chimney licking its sooty sides with greedy
avidity.

A long day's hunting in the open air,
especially when accompanied by an increase
of the physical temperature, gives birth to
a gentle lassitude, which promotes dreams,
and renders a state of do nothing not only
permissible but enjoyable.

A man feels at such seasons that he
has earned a right to repose, and nine
times out of ten gives himself up to
slumber, or, if not to slumber, to quiet
meditation which encroaches on the
borderland of sleep. Bob began by going
over all his experiences since the morning.
He summed up the pleasures and the pains
with almost morbid precision, trying hard
not to detract from the former, or to
exaonrerate the latter. But do what he
would the pains preponderated until, down

the road of thought, his brain travelled as
far as Miss Dot.

There he came to a complete halt,
almost as if he did not care to pursue his
retrospection further, but was quite content
to dwell upon the image conjured up
by her frank face, bright eyes and soft
fresh tints.

And all of a sudden it occurred to him,
like a genuine flash of inspiration, that the
big, desolate house, with its empty rooms,
and uninhabited appearance, might wear a
very different and more home-like aspect if
presided over by a clear-headed, sweet-voiced
mistress. What was wanting at
Straighten Court was a gracious, feminine
influence. He had felt it from the first
moment he set foot inside the hall, but now
there could be no doubt whatever about
the matter. A man alone could not
possibly keep authority in the household,
or make the intricate wheels of domestic

life run smoothly. How was he to order
dinner, and add up the butcher's book, and
keep peace between the maid-servants ?
There was only one answer to such a
question, and that answer was  impossible.
He could look after cattle and sheep, attend
to the farm and stables, but as to ordering
in legs of mutton and sirloin of beef  why
he simply could not do it. He revolted at
the mere thought of entering into such
petty details. As for women, it was the
business of their lives. Man-like it never
struck him that the same " petty details "
which worried him while he scorned them
have rendered many a woman miserable,
and laid a daily burden on her shoulders
under the weight of which she often
groans.

But there is no escape for her. One of
the chief uses of a wife is to lay the blame of
everything that happens at her door. And
for this reason, of all luxuries she is the

greatest. It is so easy and so nice to be able
to say in a loud, chiding voice, " My dear, it
is your fault. I told you to do it," or, " Why
the dickens have you made such a regular
mull of things all round ? "

The responsibility is shifted, very conveniently,
and the poor " luxury " can only
mumble feeble excuses and in her turn
try to implicate Mary Anne or Susan Jane.

Bob had had about ten days' housekeeping,
and already he wished to resign
the situation. He told himself that with a
nice little wife sitting opposite, even
English dinners might prove enjoyable.
His imagination could not conceive of Mrs.
Eobert P. Jarrett's fascinations being put to
a greater test, but he believed Dot would
emerge from the ordeal triumphant. True,
he was very young to think of marrying ;
indeed, up till now, he had always been a
staunch advocate of the theory that men
should have their flings  and a i2"ood one

too  before settling down to jog-trot
matrimony.

But it is astonishing how a pretty
face and good eyes will revolutionize the
most strong-minded male's theories, crumbling
them to the very dust with lightning-like
rapidity. They can alter a man's whole
train of reasoning in a few seconds, and
more wonderful still, make him advance an
entirely new line of argument. No deserter
in action could possibly change front with
greater speed or make m-ore plausible
excuses for his conduct.

Bob, who hitherto had professed to be a
confirmed bachelor, felt suddenly convinced
that the proper thing to do was to marry a
girl directly sou saw one who you thought
worm suit you. Only fools shilly-shally
under such circumstances.

The funny thing was how, after five
short minutes' conversation with Dot, he
should have arrived at so momentous a
VOL. II. 19

conclusion as to believe that lie had certainly
discovered his affinity, and could not
possibly be enchained by any other.

How men can flatter themselves they
know anything of a woman's real character
in such a brief space of time is marvellous,
to say the least of it. And yet that they
do so imagine is seen every day of one's
life, and proved by the ill-assorted and
incongruous couples so frequently met
with. A face endowed by nature with
certain good points, a pink and white complexion
and a nice expression, is quite
sufficient to convince the lords of creation
that they know the proprietor perfectly
well. Just think of it ! 1 how woman !
that masterpiece of caprice, of fitful moods
and sudden impulses ; that coy, uncertain,
changeable creature who does not even
pretend to know herself, and who admits
the variability" of her character.

Oh ! men, beware of your passions.

They render you blind as the veriest mole
that ever burrowed earth. For fully an
hour Bob sat there musing rapturously on
Miss Dot's perfections. Then by degrees a
sleepy inclination stole over him. At last
he made a vigorous effort, and risings from
the arm-chair, laid aside his pipe and went
towards the writing table. It was sometime
since he had written to his mother,
and she would be eettinf anxious if she did
not hear from him. Therefore he sat down
and inscribed the following letter ;

Dearest Mother,

I sent you a hurried account of
my uncle's sudden death and the altered
circumstances in which it left me. Even
now I can scarcely realize all that has
happened, or appreciate what I suppose
most people would call my good fortune.
I need not say that I wish you and my
brothers and sisters to share in it. It

19*

is unnecessary attempting to describe
Straighten Court to yon, because of course
you know it well. I will only mention that
in size and grandeur it far exceeds my
expectations. Indeed, I often think I
should like the place better if it were not
quite so big. Ten days have elapsed since
my arrival, and I begin to doubt if I shall
ever settle down. Everything seems so
new and so stran(]fe  forgive me if I add
so dull and so formal. There is a want
of freedom here, a stiffness and a conventionality
which produce a stifling effect
upon me. People all seem to jog on in
one little narrow groove, from which they
either cannot or will not emancipate themselves.
The consequence is there is very
little real independence, such as we see at
home ; the ladies and gentlemen are very
much to be pitied in my opinion ; as far as
I have had an opportunity judging, they
are mere slaves to their establishments,

their institutions and their bodily comforts.
They are like a flock of sheep ; if one treads
a particular path they all follow, however
inconvenient and ridiculous it may be.
Appearances are evidently a great deal
studied in this country ; the verdict of the
world carries much weight, yet in curious
contradiction to this fact, the upper classes
seem going to the dogs altogether. From
what I gather, their morality is at a very
low ebb. Even dukes and duchesses fissure
in the Divorce Court. There is a famous
case going on now, some of the details of
which would simply horrify you. The men
here have no veneration for women ; it is
dreadful the way they speak of them, and
yet I am informed that in fashionable
society the women deserve all they get.
But whether they do, or whether they
don't, it seems to me a mean, unmanly sort
of thing to go about backbiting the poor
creatures. You will think I have turned

very censorious, so now for a change of
subject. I went out hunting to-day for the
first time ; the sport is a grand one ; I
don't believe there is another that can
compare with it, and yet it seems odd too,
wherein the pleasure consists of chasing a
little red animal, and running the risk of
breaking your bones, if not your neck, in
the pursuit. But there are some things
that don't bear analyzing and, thank goodness
! fox-hunting is one of them. May it
never be picked to pieces by a herd of
dissecting critics, for when it ceases to
exist England's day will be done, and she
can take a back seat among the nations ;
so much for the glorious chase. You see
what an enthusiast it has made of me. But
the field ! the people ! those genial, jovial
squires whose acquaintance I so longed to
make ; words cannot describe the insolence
of their manners towards an unoflendiufT
stranger. To tell you how they treated

your first-born, mother dear, would only
pain you. Therefore I pass over my reception
in silence. Suffice it that all my
illusions are gone, I fear me, never to
return. The question is, whether I shall
be able to live amongst these people. And
this brings me to an important point.
How strange it seems having to communicate
one's plans by letter. At present it is
horribly cold over here, and later on the
climate becomes, if possible, worse. Now
what I would propose is this. In the
spring I must certainly return to Australia,
if only to wind up affairs and hand over
the farm to Dick. Instead, therefore, of
you and the girls joining me at once,
leaving warmth and sunshine and coming
to frost and fogs, I am of opinion that it
would be far wiser to defer your journey,
until the winter is over. Then we might
all travel back together. What do you say
to this idea? To tell the honest truth, I

feel as if my life here were an experiment.
I may or I may not settle to it. In two or
three months' time I should be in a better
position to judge whether you and the girls
are likely to be as happy at Straighten
Court as at home. We have been colonists
so long that frequently I have misgivings
as to our ever succeeding in converting
ourselves into fine gentlemen and ladies
of the orthodox type. One needs to be
brought up to it. To break up our dear
old home before we are perfectly-certain
the new one will suit us, appears to me an
imprudent act. For myself, it is quite on
the cards that you may see me, at anytime,
return unexpectedly. I feel awfully
homesick already, and miss you all most
dreadfully. I never thought it would be
possible to get so dead tired of one's own
society. Nobody has condescended to call
upon me so far, except a couple of parsons,
who both immediately begged for subscriptions

to various charities. The County
people seem a very stuck-up lot. I don't
wonder you preferred my father, and
showed your good sense by running away
from them. And now, dear mother, I am
very tired and very sleepy, and must leave
off. Give my love to Belle and Tot tie, and
the little ones, and tell Dick from me that
I trust to him to look after you well in my
absence.

Ever your affectionate son,

Robert P. Barrett."

Not a word of Miss Lankester. Something
made Bob shy of mentioning her
name, even to those he confided in most.

And yet he felt as guilty as if he were
concealing a secret of vital importance.
He re-read his letter, and made some
trifling corrections. But when he came
to the end a sudden impulse urged him
to add :

"I forgot to tell you that I am giving
my first dinner-party tomorrow night. It
is almost absurd to call it by such a name,
since the company consist only of a Doctor
and Mrs. Lankester and their daughter.
They live in the village, and are my nearest
neighbours."

Bob perused this postcript with considerable
self-approbation. It satisfied his
conscience and yet revealed nothing. He
felt proud of having handled such a
delicate matter with so much skill, for if,
at any future time, there should be anything
to tell, then he flattered himself that
he had paved the way for telling it. At
least the name of Lankester would not
burst like a bombshell upon the family
circle.

As he sealed up his letter Charles
brought in a note on a silver salver.

It was from Dot.

The contents were brief enough.

o

Dear Mr. Jarrett,

My father and mother wish me
to thank you for your kind invitation, and
to say that we shall be very pleased to dine
with you tomorrow at half-past seven.

Hoping you feel none the worse for
having got so wet, believe me,
Yours sincerely,

Dorothea Lankester."

Only a formal note of acceptance, worded
in polite but distant language, and yet Bob
gazed at it with rapturous admiration.

What a pretty handwriting she wrote!
so clean, and neat, and thoroughly feminine.
He liked the way she crossed her t's and
dotted her i's ; there was a deal of character
about them. And then he took to speculating
how the signature would look if it
were signed Dorothea Jarrett instead of
Dorothea Lankester.

Lankester was a fine, high-sounding?
name. The sort of name just suited for
the heroine of a novel, but for all that
there was something very pleasing about
Jarrett.

D. for Dorothea, and J. for Jarrett went
well together  very well, he considered.

So, with his head stuffed full of strange
new thoughts, this hitherto sensible young
man went to bed, and  dreamt of Miss
Dot?

Not he.

He was far too tired and stiff to indulge
in any trance-like visions.

The dun cob, the gray eyes, the frank,
innocent face, all faded from his mind as if
they had been a mirage, and settling down
between the sheets he slept like a top.

GETTING UP A FLIRTATION.

Punctually at half-past seven next morning
Bob was roused from his dreamless
slumbers by Charles, who, after tapping at
the door and receiving no response, entered
the room majestically, and began pulling
up the blinds with noisy clumsiness.

Halloa ! Charles, is that you ? What's
the time ? " yawned Bob.

It has just gone half-past seven, sir."
By Jove ! You don't say so."
And before he was thoroughly awake
Bob jumped out of bed, goaded by the
knowledge that he had a journey to take.
After his experiences of the previous day
the indifference to personal appearance
which he had hitherto displayed vanished

miraculously. He was prepared to admit
that there mifht be something in clothes
after all. Those soft snowy leathers and
bright scarlet coats undoubtedly did set a
man off. Until he had actually seen them
with his own eyes he could not have
realized how great an effect they produced.
In fact, all Bob's ideas on the
subject of adornment had undergone a
complete transformation. He was now
filled with a consuming desire to appear
out hunting dressed precisely as his neighbours
were dressed.

Consequently he had decided to run upto
town, and lose no time in ordering a
suitable stock of boots and breeches.
Although he had said as little as possible
about the discomforts caused by his attire,
and the breaking of those elastic straps, he
had been unable to prevent Charles from
acquiring a tolerably accurate knowledge
of the situation ; and Charles had strongly

advised and approved of his going to
London and purchasing a proper hunting
kit without any delay.

I told you afore you went 'hunting 'ow
it would be, sir," he said with a malicious
chuckle. Consequently Bob had studied
the Bradshaw, and discovered that if he
rose tolerably early he could reach the
metropolis a little after eleven o'clock and
return in time for dinner.

So he dressed hurriedly, ate an excellent
breakfast, and by half-past eight was bowling
honor to the station in a light, two-wheeled
cart, drawn by a hog-maned,
fast-trotting pony.

The mornings was fresh and brio-ht.

The bifid, Teen fields on either side of
the hedgerows were steeped in pale, yellow
sunshine, not fierce and glaring as in the
summer-time, but cool, light, clear, and
refreshing to the eye. Every now and
again a swift, dark cloud shadow would

come coursing alonnf their emerald surface,
for a few minutes converting all the vivid
tints into a sombre grey. But as it raced
ahead it was beautiful to behold the glory
of leaf and blade bursting out afresh,
appearing yet brighter and greener for
their temporary obliteration.

Big, black, limpid-eyed oxen stood close
under the hedges, rubbing their broad,
scurfy foreheads against the knotted twigs,
and slowly but steadily boring apertures
in the thick fences with their strong,
polished horns.

Gay autumnal hues adorned the trees ;
red, brown and yellow combined to render
their last span of life beautiful. Their
tall, irregular tops towered up towards the
faint blue sky, and in places where the
leaves had already fallen, revealed the
delicate network of their construction.
As for the birds, they were twittering and
chirping, flitting and alighting, almost as

if the time of year had been March instead
of November, forgetting that the winter

'DO

was approaching with its cruel frosts, cold
snows, and pitiless winds. They recked
not of the future, wee, happy, thoughtless
things ! The present with its gladsome
sunshine was all they cared about,
believing that this one bright day would
last for ever.

As Bob drove along, the cool, bracing
air bringing a healthy glow to his cheeks,
he thought that never had he been out on
such a fair m morning. What struck him
most was the astonishing greenness of everything.
Here was no sign of drought or
barrenness, but everywhere the same
verdant, fertile stretches of undulating
pastures meeting the sky-line and extending
in all directions, far as the eye could
reach. It was a perfect harmony of blue
and green, with a dash of yellow thrown

in to give light to the whole.

VOL. II. 20

Bob arrived at the station in good time,
took his ticket, purchased a morning paper,
and ensconced himself in a smoking-carriage.


He waited thus some minutes, when
befrinnini to wonder why the train did not

DO J

start he put his head out of the window.
Then for the first time he became aware
of a commotion on the platform, which
appeared to be caused by a dapper little
female figure, enveloped in a thick Scotch
ulster, that presently came tripping along
as fast as it could move for a pair of brand
new, and evidently extremely tight, hunting
boots.

I'm late, dreadfully late," cried an
excited feminine voice, speaking in high,
agitated tones. "There was a mistake
about the horse-box. Put me in anywhere
; I'm not at all particular."

Bob had already fled and lit a favourite
cherry-wood pipe. The next moment, to

his no small discomfiture, lie found the
owner of the voice securely locked into
his compartment by a stalwart, red-bearded
guard.

What an idiot that boy of mine is, to
be sure ! " exclaimed the fair one crossly,
apparently too much flustered to notice
that she was not alone, and evidently venting
her wrath by giving utterance to it
aloud. " I declare if he didn't go and take
a ticket for Master ton, when I told him as
distinctly as possible overnight that I
intended hunting with the Gallopers to-day
instead of with the Seldom Kill hounds.
I really think I shall have to give him
warning. His stupidity is too great for
anything."

So saying, she stood up and smoothed
her ruffled plumes, buttoned up her ulster,
and generally adjusted her toilette, the
finishing touches of which had clearly been
performed in a hurry. The train whistled,

an't raovel slowly out of the station. She
was jerked back into her seat, and Bob
half rose to go to her assistance.

The recognition was instantaneous.

Lady De Fochsey ! " he exclaimed.

"Mr. Jarrett!" she ejaculated on her
ride, in well-pleased accents, for Bob's
fresh, good-looking face had already made
an impression upon her ladyship out hunting,
and she was determined to get up a
flirtation, in the hopes that that long deferred
passion might possibly spring into life.
''I do hope you will forgive my forcing
m} company upon you in this exceedingly
unceremonious fashion, but the truth is,
I was so abominably late that I really
had not time to notice whether the
guard put me into a smoking-carriage or
not."

(As a matter of fact, she invariably chose
one by preference, having a rooted dislike
to the society of her own sex, but this

idiosyncrasy lie did not deem fit to
mention.)

Pray don't apologize," said Bob
politely, knocking the tobacco out of his
pipe with an alacrity more feigned than
real.

Oh ! Mr. Jarrett, why did you do
that ? "

I thought you might object to smoke.
Nine ladies out of ten do."

I don't. Not in the least. I assure
you I'm quite accustomed to it. Besides "
casting a languishing flance at him from
under her goldfish eyelashes  " you need
not mind me, surely."

I can't help minding you," he responded
audaciously, having already
decided that if he indulged in a few
flowers of speech, there was not much fear
of his meeting' with a rebuff. " You are
far too charming to be ignored, wherever
you may be."

She smiled encouragingly. This young
man promised uncommonly well ; better
even than she had suspected. She had
feared he might prove shy, but now she
altered her opinion. If there was one thing
she loved in this world, it was a good,
honest, outspoken admission of her charms.
If only her admirers would keep on telling
her that she was pretty, fascinating, divine,
she could forgive them almost any impertinence.
She was not very strait-laced,
but flattery she must have.

'' When are you coming to see me ? " she
inquired coquettishly, in answer to Bob's
remark.

When are you going to ask me ? " he
rejoined, giving up any attempt at reading
the newspaper, and seating himself directly
opposite to her.

I have asked you already, Mr.
Jarrett."

Only in a very general way. I don't

prefer your specifying a day, if you have
no objection."

Dear me ! " lie exclaimed, " low
punctilious we are, to be sure ! Do you
always stand on so much ceremony ? One
is not accustomed to it now-a-days."

Yes," answered Bob gravely, " whenever
there is a pretty woman in the case, I
would rather have five minutes' chat with
her alone than three hours in the presence
of a dozen other men. The fact of the
matter is, I'm covetous, and prefer not
sharing my bone."

Lady De Fochsey was delighted. She
thoroughly enjoyed this style of conversation,
and moreover possessed the happy
faculty of believing that where she herself
was concerned men meant all they said, and
were perfectly sincere in their professions
of admiration.

Oh, you flatterer!" she said, shaking
her blonde head playfully at him, " you are

trying to put me off with compliments,
instead of settling a day for your visit. I
call that too bad."

Such an idea never entered my head,"
protested Bob. " When is your ladyship
at home ? "

I'm alway's at home to my particular
friends."

And may I venture to think myself
included in their number ? "

Now, Mr. Jarrett, you want to
know too much. That's hardly a fair
question."

"Perhaps not," he admitted. " I'll ask
you another one instead. Tell me, is not
Sunday generally supposed to be a good
day for calling, or do your devotions
prevent you from receiving gentlemen on
that afternoon ? "

Oh ! dear no, not at all."
Ah ! I'm glad to hear it. I was afraid
you might have some religious scruples on

the subject." He spoke with just a touch
of sarcasm, which she detected and
resented.

T do not know why you should have
imagined anything half so foolish," she rejoined
tartly. " And as for my religious
scruples, I flatter myself that I possess
neither more nor less than my neighbours.
Perhaps you mayn't believe me, but I
always make a point of going to church
every Sunday morning, if only for the sake
of the example."

One attendance franks you for the rest
of the day, I presume ? " said Bob, with a
laugh.

She recovered her brood humour. It was
a relief to find he was not disagreeably
strict.

Well, yes, it does, I confess."

Ah ! I thought so."

For my part," she said decidedly, " I
can't see the least harm in entertaining a

few amusing people on a Sabbath afternoon."



Neither can I," he acquiesced, quite
approving of the sentiment.

In that case, Mr. Jarrett, I shall expect
you on Sunday without fail."

How long an audience do you grant
your admirers at a time. Lady de Fochsey?
Ten minutes, quarter of an hour ? "

She laughed her little, thin, artificial
lauli.

You shall have a whole hour if you are
good, and promise to come early."

That I certainly will. The instant I've
gobbled my lunch I shall set out."

Do. I live quite close to Straighten
Court, Mr. Jarrett. Only about two miles ;
it's nothing of a walk, and I hope you will
come over often'*

Thanks, you are very kind. And I can
assure you that were the walk ten times as
long I should think nothing of the distance

with such a reward awaiting me at the end
of it."

She put out her foot, and glanced coyly
down at it. It was a very pretty one, and
she was quite aware of the fact, and saw
no reason why other people should not
become acquainted with it too. A clever
woman always makes the most of her good
points, and hides the bad ones. Lady De
Fochsey was not a bit ashamed of her foot,
no  nor of her ancle either. Thank goodness
! they were both symmetrical and
patrician, though her people were nobodies,
and she herself was only in the position of
a poorly paid companion, when Sir
Jonathan had been smitten by her charms.
 " Really, Mr. Jarrett," she said, in honied
tones, " you will quite turn my head if
you will insist on paying me so many
compliments."

It was a regular invitation to repeat the
offence. At all events, Bob, who was no

fool, construed her ladyship's accusation
as such, and construed it aright.

I don't think it altogether fair to lay
the whole blame at my door," he responded,
feeling more and more amused by her
transparent coquetries, and evident desire
to ea: him on.

Why not ? " she inquired with a
simper.

For the very simple reason that if that
extremely pretty little head of yours were
capable of being turned in such a manner,
the mischief must have been done lonj
since. I can only be one of many

sinners'*

Positively, Mr. Jarrett, if you go on
talking in this foolish fashion, I shall have
to impose a fine upon you," she rejoined,
her whole countenance beaming]: with
deliijht.

Any fine imposed upon me by
your ladyship would be rapturously accepted,"

he said, not able to refrain from
laughter.

Then thinking she might wonder at his
mirth, and also that he had administered
enough sugar  at any rate for the present
he added more seriously :

By the-by, where are you going to
hunt to-day ? "

"I? Oh! with the Gallopers. I get
out at the next station "

"So soon?" interrupted Bob, with a
well-simulated sigh.

Yes, you ridiculous creature. So soon,
and what's more, I shan't have any too
much time, as I have to ride nearly twelve
miles to the meet."

I had no idea you were so determined
a Diana. But won't it make a very long
day for you ? " he inquired, wondering at
her energy.

"It would, only, luckily for me, I am
not coming home to-night. A great friend

of mine, a Mrs. St. John, has asked me to
stay at her house this evening. In fact,
that was the principal reason why I determined
to hunt to-day. I wanted to see the
Gallopers, and I also wanted to attend a
private seance, which is to take place
to-night at Mrs. St. John's."

A what ? " echoed Bob, in tones of
bewilderment.

A seance. Surely you must know what
that means."

"Not exactly There are so many
different kinds."

Mrs. St. John is a firm believer in
spiritualism," explained Lady De Fochsey,
and she has invited a well-known medium
down from town, on purpose to try and
obtain some fresh manifestations. Only a
few chosen spirits are to be present."

Do you go in for that kind of thing ? "
asked Bob, thinking what a queer mixture
his companion was.

A little," she answered, dropping her
voice to a mysterious whisper. " Mind
you don't tell anybody. I don't wish it
known all over the hunting-field, but I'm
developing psychic force."

Oh ! indeed, and pray how do you
develop it?"

I can't tell you now. It would take
too long, but I will some other time.
Unfortunately I don't get on very fast."

"How's that? Uncongenial influences?"

Yes, partly," she replied. " The difficult
thiner is that the electric current,
which by many is supposed to be the
foundation of all spiritualism, can only be
communicated in my case by means of a
kindred spirit."

And do you mean to tell me that you
have never come across one ? " asked Bob
incredulously.

She looked up at him with an odd,
uncertain expression.

No, Mr. Jarrett, I have not."

Then the blue eyes dropped suddenly,
and she added hesitatingly : " But  perhaps
 I may now. Who knows ? " and up
went those azure orbs again, with the most
infantine and innocent of looks. Somehow
they seemed to go right through Bob, and
to produce a most uncomfortable sensation,
just as if he were being requested to perform
some action which went against the
grain. He reddened up to the very roots
of his hair, and remained transfixed, as it
were, until her gaze was withdrawn. What
a queer little mortal she was ! He couldn't
make her out at all.

Did she intend to convey the idea that
he was the kindred spirit whose advent had
been expected and looked forward to for
so many years ? His modesty took alarm
at the thought.

And yet she was very pretty in her little,
neat, got-up style, very pretty  and veri.

VERY amusing. nevertheless so embarrassed
did he feel by Lady De Fochsey's words
and more than gracious manner, that it
was quite a relief when the train in which
they were travelling rushed into a station,
and the lady declared that she had arrived
at her destination.

How quickly the time has gone, to be
sure ! " she exclaimed regretfully, gathering
up her skirt, her hunting crop and her
worsted gloves . " I had no idea we were
so near Millingboro' ! It only shows what
an agreeable companion you have been.
Good-bye, Mr. Jarrett ; don't forget to
come on Sunday." And she waved the tips
of her fingers airily, and hopped out on to
the platform before Bob had had time to
recover his self-possession.

Is there nothing I can do for you ? "
he asked, with a sudden sense of relief.
"I will go and see after your horse-box if
you like."

VOL. II. 21

My dear, foolish young man, don't
think of such a thing. Why, your train
starts again immediately. Ta ! ta ! And
don't lose your heart in the gay but vicious
metropolis."

So saying Lady De Fochsey walked
away, and as the train once more moved
off Bob could hear a high-pitched feminine
voice, shorn of all its dulcet and melodious
intonations, scolding away at an unfortunate
groom.

Phew ! " he exclaimed, as he settled
himself in his seat, and once more re-lit
the cherry-wood pipe. " That woman's a
rum 'un, and no mistake. Awful sport,
though, if she weren't quite such a humbug,
and didn't stare at you in such a
funny way. I wonder what the deuce she
means by it." And then he thought of
somebody who, he would stake his life, was
as true and honest as the day ; somebody
who did not look at men in that queer,

equivocal fashion, who scorned petty artifices
and unjustifiable means of rendering
herself attractive, and who, on that very
account, was a hundred thousand times
more so.

Fancy his talkinf to Miss Lankester in
the free and easy style he had at once
adopted when addressing Lady De Fochsey.
He could imagine how wide the gray eyes
would open with indignant amazement.

And now that he was alone, and removed
from her ladyship's fascination, he
even blamed himself for having been so
familiar. The temptation certainly was
great. It takes a very strong man to
resist the advances of a good-looking
woman. He may pick ever so many holes
in her afterwards, but at the time, he can't
help feeling flattered and amused, and if
she gives him an inch, takes a liberal elL
Masculine nature will out.

Furthermore an irresistible sense of

21*

mischief had arisen within Bob's bosom.
It was fun  splendid fun, paying the vain
little woman high-flown compliments and
seeing the avidity with which she swallowed
them ; but, nevertheless, when he came
calmly to review his own conduct, he was
fain to admit that such silly, butterfly
specimens of the female sex could not exist
unless men encouraged them.

It was the perpetual fostering of their
vanity by speeches containing not a germ
of truth, but which were accepted by the
listener in perfect good faith, that was
responsible for so painful and preposterous
a pitch of feminine idiocy.

In his heart of hearts, despite her youth,
position, and personal attractions, Bob felt
repulsed rather than drawn towards Lady
De Fochsey. She represented a type of
womanhood which he both pitied and despised.
And yet he did not for one instant
believe that there was any real harm in

her. She was only silly  very silly and
frivolous. But lie experienced an uncomfortable
conviction, that he had encouraged
her to be even more silly and more
frivolous, just for his own amusement.

Was this right, or gentlemanly, or
honourable ?

He preferred not to answer the question.

For he had sense enough, and good
feeling enough to know that female credulity,
vanity, and folly, all combined, in
the absence of much heart and a total
deficiency of head piece, render a woman
one of the saddest spectacles on the face
of this earth.

As for what lad been said between them
when one came to analyze the conversation,
a single word summed it up.

That word was rubbish  unmitigated
rubbish from beginning to end.

Yet, no doubt, this was the wny pccjle
talked in polite society.

LEFT IN THE LURCH.

Bob returned from town in an extremely
satisfied state of mind. Fortune had
favoured him almost beyond his expectations,
for on driving to Messrs. Taut and
Son's well-known establishment, in order
to be measured for some breeches, he was
lucky enough to find a pair that had just
been returned which exactly fitted him.

These he purchased on the spot, delighted
to have something to fall back
upon during the time his own were being
made. After enjoining haste, he repaired
to another celebrated emporium, and spent
a small fortune in boots, gaiters, &c.

Altogether, the day's expedition proved

a great success, and although quite a week,
if not more, must elapse before he could
array himself in the full glories of a brand
new red coat, still as long as his nether
limbs were suitably cased, he no longer
felt afraid of appearing in the hunting field.
Evvn General Prosieboy would not seem
half so formidable when opposed by boots
and breeches as immaculate as his own.
As for bow-tying, Charles had promised to
give him a lesson, and initiate him into all
the difficulties of that delicate art.

Bob reached Straight em Court just intime
to dress for dinner.

In honour of Miss Lankester he had
given orders for the drawing-room to be
lit up, and to this room he therefore repaired
to receive his guests. The housemaids
had been busy most of the forenoon,
removing brown holland covers, taking up
drugget, and shaking out curtains. Consequently
Bob was unprepared ibr the

gorgeousness now revealed. As he stood
warming himself before the fire, with his
back leanin<2f against the solid marble
mantelpiece, he looked round complacently
at the old-fashioned crimson and silt furniture,
the rich velvet hangings, and elaborately
decorated walls on which Cupids and
cherubim were freely represented. The
style of the whole thing was perhaps rather
florid, but Bob knew very little of the
tenets held by the Aesthetic school ; he had
not been educated up to the sun flower and
the lily, the bulrush and the peacock, and
therefore considered the general appearance
of his drawing-room highly satisfactory.


Of course, if later on. Miss Dot wished
anything changed, or innovations introduced,
she had only to say the word.
In matters of taste. Bob was quite willing
to defer his judgment to hers. Women
knew a <reat deal more about these things

than men. Besides, they had such a
wonderful way of twisting chairs and
tables about, and robbing them of all
their formality. No room really looked
habitable until touched up by a feminine
hand. Perhaps Dot might like to have a
new carpet. The present one, although
handsome, was certainly somewhat too
crude in colouring, and too suggestive of
Joseph's coat. A grand piano also  he
suddenly noticed that the room contained
only a cottage instrument of very antiquated
appearance  she must have one naturally.
It should be the very first present he would
make when  when they were engaged.

Thus resolving, the door flew open, and
Dr. and Miss Lankester were announced.

The blood rushed up to Bob's face as he
went to greet his visitors, and shook the
object of his thoughts warmly by the
hand, feeling that she, at any rate, was
quite an old acquaintance.

"Why, where is Mrs. Lancaster?" he
inquired of her husband, after they too had
gone through the ceremony of handshaking.
" You have not left her at home,
surely ? "

I am sorry to say, Mr Jarrett, that
my wife was unable to accompany us,"
replied the doctor apologetically. " The
fact of the matter is, she is subject to very
bad, sick headaches, and unfortunately one
attacked her this afternoon."

I regret to hear that," said Bob politely,
disappointed at Mrs. Lankester's absence,
since he had been curious to see what
manner of woman Dot's mother was.

"We ought perhaps to have sent and
let you know," continued Dr. Lankester,
but my wife hoped, up to the very
last moment, that she might be able to dine
with you to-night, and so put off sending
until it was too late."

The loss is altogether mine I feel

certain," returned Bob in his most cordial
manner. " But I shall hope very soon to
have another opportunity of making Mrs.
Lankester's acquaintance. Tell her we
missed her much'*

But although he spoke so courteously,
after the first moment he did not seem to
mind doing without the mamma, as long
as he had the daughter. Until now he
had hardly trusted himself to look at Dot.
He had felt so curiously and unaccountably
shy, whilst his heart beat so fast that it
seemed to him as if she must hear it. But
when he had ensconced her in the most
comfortable chair he could find, he
summoned up sufficient courage to steal a
sidelong glance at her. Hurried as it was,
it enabled him to take in all the details.

He could see that she was dressed in
some sort of soft, cream-coloured material,
made hish to the throat, and cut in the
simplest possible fashion. No frills, no

furbelows, no flounces. Perhaps if he had
been entertaining a party of fine ladies,
they might have called Dot's gown skimpy
and old-fashioned. Certainly it displayed
no artificial protuberance below the waist,
or deficiency of stuff above. If it was
skimpy it was skimpy only as regarded the
skirt, not the body. But whatever might
have been its defects, to Bob's mind Miss
Lankester's gown suited the wearer to
perfection.

The clinfTinfT muslin outlined her slight
form admirably, displaying its rounded
curves to far better advantage than the
costliest silk or satin. Above the soft,
creamy folds rose her slender throat, and
shapely, well-poised head, whose stag-like
carriage was full of grace and beaut v, and
constituted one of her chief attractions.

There was no doubt about it, she was
very pretty  prettier even than he had
believed her to be ; whilst the singularly

honest expression of her face rendered it
to him, at least, peculiarly fascinating.
Then he looked critically at her father
standing within a few feet of him. Doctor
Lankester was a handsome man. It was
easy to see from whom his daughter
had inherited her good looks. He had the
same straight, delicate features, the same
colouring, and clear, grey eyes, with large
dark pupils, which in some lights appeared
almost black. Like Dot, he was short
rather than tall, but slender and perfectly
proportioned.

Well, and what have you been doing
with yourself to-day, Mr. Jarrett ? " Dr.
Lankester asked of his host, as soon as the
first bustle of their arrival had subsided.
I suppose you did not go out hunting.
The meet was a long way off."

It was," answered Bob. *' And therefore
I profited by the opportunity to take
a run up to town."

Indeed ! And how was town looking ? "

Simply filthy. When I left here about
half-past eight o'clock this morning it was
the most lovely day imaginable  a bright
sun and a blue sky  but as we neared
London a dense curtain of io arose,
which grew thicker and thicker every
moment. As for the atmosphere, it was
laden with smuts, dirt, and every kind of
abomination, which got into my eyes,
down my throat, and up my nostrils. I
never was more thankful in my life than
to get back to fresh country air that did
not poison one's lungs. Phew ! I can feel
it now."

And yet people who live in London
don't seem to mind the foss one bit,"
remarked Dot.

"I suppose tlie} get accustomed to
them," returned Bob. " But it would
take me a very long time to become
acclimatized." And as he spoke he beiran

to cough, the impure air to which he was
not habituated having evidently irritated
his throat to a considerable degree.

Dot looked up.

Have you got a cold, Mr. Jarrett ? "
she asked with concern.

Yes, I believe I have managed to catch
a slight one. Somehow or other I have
felt shivery ever since yesterday's wetting."

Then you should take care of yourself,"
said Dr. Lankester in a kindly, but
semi-professional manner.

"Too much bother," answered Bob
lightly, with all a strong young man's
disdain of coddling. " I never think anything
of a cold. Besides, it's really
nothings. Not worth talking about."

But as he said the words, he coughed
again, and this time worse than before.

Doctor Lankester glanced at him, and
saw that he was flushed, and showed every
symptom of having contracted a chill.

Very likely not," lie said quietly.
But you must remember, Mr. Jarrett, that
you are not used to our English climate.
It is a very treacherous one, I assure you,
and few people can afford to take liberties
with it. The winters are often extremely
severe, especially of late years, when in
some parts of the country the thermometer
has registered as many as twenty degrees of
frost."

The conversation was here interrupted
by the entrance of the butler, who
announced that dinner was ready. No
Englishman is ever indifferent to this
acceptable summons, and Dr. Lankester at
once ceased talking, and waited politely for
his host to make a move.

Bob gave his arm to Dot, regretting that
he had been unable to provide an agreeable,
elderly lady for her father.

It is so good of you to come in this
sort of way," he said apologetically. "I

wish I could have asked some people to
meet you, but the fact of the matter is, I
don't know anybody yet."

I'm very glad you didn't," answered
Dot with characteristic frankness. " My
father and I will enjoy a quiet evening
alone with you ever so much more. You
see," she added brightly, " we look upon
you as a novelty. You can tell us all kind
of things we know little or nothing of,
whereas Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Jones  dear,
excellent people as they may be  only
prattle away about their domestic concerns
with which we are already thoroughly
conversant'

Bob laughed.

I'm so awfully afraid you'll find it
dull," he said.

Dull ! " looking up at him with

sparkling eyes. " That is paying yourself

an exceedingly bad compliment, Mr. Jarrett.

As for me, I am a pretty good hand at

VOL. II. 22

amusing myself. There is a great deal of
enjoyment to be got out of life, if only one
has a sense of the ridiculous and cultivates
the faculty of applying it to everyday
trifles. Besides, you forget that a visit to
Straighten Court is quite an event in our
humble experience."

Why ? Did you not come here often
in Captain Straighten's time ? "

Often ? Xo. We came exactly once a
year. Every spring we were invited to a
formal luncheon at the conclusion of the
hunting season. We invariably met our
clergyman and his wife, whom as you may
imagine we see frequently, and the county
solicitor and his married daughter. This
lunch was evidently a duty ailliir. It could
not possibly be mistaken for anything else.
The conversation was lame and forced on
both sides. We asked after the sport and
the hounds, our host after our individual
health, and how we had got through the

winter. After these civilities had been
exchanged, we fell back upon eating and
drinking. As for poor Captain Straighten,
it was impossible to help pitying him. He
looked so superlatively miserable, and so
infinitely bored. Altogether, the relief
was immense when the festivity came to an
end, and the strain was over. But," she
concluded, pulling up short, " I ought not
to talk in this sort of wav, now that
Captain Straighten is dead and gone."

I am surprised at what you tell me,"
said Bob, who had listened attentively
to his companion's observations. "I can't
imagine how my uncle could have lived so
near to you without getting to be on very
friendly terms."

For his part, he felt convinced that if he
were to see Miss Dot only a few times more,
his feelings would inevitably become something
even warmer than friendly. He was
irresistibly drawn towards her.

"You don't seem to know much of
Captain Straiglitem," said the young lady
seriously. "If you did, you could not
fancy him capable of being on what you
call ' friendly terms ' with people in our
lowly position."

What was he like ? " asked Bob with
considerable curiosity.

He was a very gentlemanly man," she
replied. "Exceedingly quiet and reserved
in his manner, and always remarkably
neatly dressed. Further than that, I can
tell you nothing, except that somehow or
other he invariably contrived to make you
feel that he looked upon you as an
inferior."

By Jove ! " exclaimed Bob, "but that's
exactly the way some of these swells made
me feel yesterday."

"Did they?" said Dot. "Then I can
sympathize with you, Mr. Jarrett, for I
know from experience that it is by no

means a comfortable sensation. I do not
mind a bit on my own account, but I do
mind on father's. He is so clever and well-informed,
and I can't bear to see him
snubbed by people who have not as much
in their whole bodies as he has in his little
finger."

And does not Dr. Lankester resent such
conduct ? "

No," she answered spiritedly. " I have
to resent it for him. Father has far too
large a mind to take notice of trifles."

He has a warm champion, at any rate.
It must be very nice to have somebody to
stick up for one," said Bob. "I only
wish "

But he was unable to conclude the
sentence, for having marched down a long
corridor, they had now reached the diningroom,
and after seating themselves at table,
were soon discussion? an excellent dinner.
The meal passed very pleasantly.

Dr. Lankester was not only a good
talker, but had the rare art of inducing
those with whom he came in contact to
talk also. He would start a subject, and
when it was fairly launched through the
shallows of polite conversation, adopt the
role of listener. Before lonij Bob found
himself describing his life in Australia, the
soil, climate, government and a hundred
different things, in all of which Dr.
Lankester appeared to take an interest.

Dot did not say much ; nevertheless,
from the animated expression of her
countenance, it was easy to tell that her
silence did not proceed from stupidity, but
rather from modesty, youth, and a highly
receptive faculty, which rendered it a
delight to sit still and listen, whilst others
were talking sensibly.

They lingered long over their wine.
Dot had made a movement as if to leave
the gentlemen to themselves, but Bob

particularly requested her to remain.
Consequently it was nearly a quarter past
nine before they rose from the table.

Would you like to smoke a cigar,
doctor ? " asked Bob, " because, if so, we
can go into my little snuggery, provided,
of course, that Miss Lankester does not
object."

Oh ! never mind Dot," he answered
with paternal confidence. " She is quite
accustomed to the smell of tobacco, and
always keeps me company over my post-cranial
pipe."

Upon this, the trio adjourned to a small,
cosy apartment of which Bob had taken
special possession, and which being one of
the oftener used, was about the most
comfortable room in the house. Three
capacious easy chairs were dragged in
front of the fire, and herein they seated
themselves. There was something pleasant
and informal about this arrangement, which

the hard-working doctor, for one, highly
preferred to the red-and-gold glories of the
drawing room. He had had a long day,
and thoroughly enjoyed stretching his
weary limbs before the hearth, and
deliberately puffing away at the fragrant
cigar which Bob had just handed to him.

They were settling down to a quiet,
peaceful evening, when the general
harmony was disturbed by the delivery
of a note fur Doctor Lankester.

lie opened it a trifle impatiently. Calm
and easy-going as he was, the moment
proved inopportune. " Dear me ! '' he
exclaimed in accents of vexation, when he
had read the letter through, springing to
his feet as he spoke. " This is terribly
annoying, and the worst of my profession.
One never can be at rest for two minutes
at a time."

What is the matter, father?" inquired
Dot.

A summons to a bad confinement case.
I must oro at once. The woman's life is in
danger. I wish to goodness people would
give over having babies, or else that they
would time their entry into the world at
more convenient hours."

Poor Doctor Lankester ! He was very,
very tired, else he never would have spoken
in this manner.

"Must you really go?" asked Bob.

Yes, I am sorry to say I must, and that
at once. The case is a very urgent one,
and I should reproach myself for ever if I
allowed my own love of comfort to prevent
me from going to the poor creature's
assistance." And he threw away his cigar,
as if trying to resist temptation.

Suddenly he remembered his daughter.

Dot, my girl," he said, addressing her,
what's to be done ? I shall have to take
the carriage, since every minute is of importance."


"All right, father," she answered cheerfully,
*'I will go and get my shawl at

once."

Stop a bit. Dot. You don't quite
understand the situation. I can't possibly
take you with me."

Why not, father, can you not drop me
on the road ? "

No, I have to go in quite a contrary
direction. The only plan will be for you
to stay here until I can send the carriage
back  that is to say, if Mr. Jarrett has no
objection."

Bob expressed his extreme satisfaction
with the proposed arrangement. He liked
Dr. Lankester uncommonly, but he liked
his daughter better, and looked forward
with delight to a most agreeable icie-a'tHe,

But the youn;] lady did not altogether
appear to relish the idea. A shade of
displeasure passed over her sunny face.

I think that I had better come with

you, father," lie said in the same tones of
gentle dignity Bob remembered her using
once before. " I could wait in the carriage,
just as well as here."

Sto," he replied. '' It would only
fidget me to think that you were there.
Besides, it is quite likely I may have to
send Thomson into town, to fetch medicines
at the dispensary, in which case you might
never get home all night. Leave it to me,
and I will either send the carriage back as
soon as possible, or else order a fly."

I can walk back," said Dot resolutely.
It's no distance, and mv shoes are
tolerably thick."

Evidently the tete-astute was not to
her mind, or else she disliked its being
forced upon her without her giving her
consent.

While this discussion was going on, Bob
stood by, feeling a perfect beast. There
were horses enough and carriages enough

too in his stables, doinir nothings at that
very moment, but he never offered to
produce them for Miss Lankester's benefit.
The single brougham would have conveyed
her most snugly back to her home. Yet
he said not a word.

The truth was, his imagination had taken
fire at the bare thought of setting Dot all

O DO

alone to himself for half an hour, or with
good luck, perhaps even a whole one. He
felt thoroughly ashamed of his conduct. He
did not attempt to excuse it in any way,
but the temptation was too strong to be
resisted, and he maintained an obstinate
silence. Even when once the ijirl looked
appealingly at him, he made no offer of
lending a vehicle. Dot, on her side,
though she knew quite well that there
were any number in the boathouse, was
far too proud to beg for the loan of one.
Only for the first time, she experienced a
kind of hostility against her host. He might

have helped her out of her difficulty, and
he had refused to do so.

Well," said Dr. Lankester, giving himself
a stretch, "there's no peace for the
wicked, and I must be off. Good night,
Jarrett. Thanks for your hospitality."

And am I really to stay here, father ? "
asked poor Dot in consternation.

"Yes, child. I thought we had settled
all that. I will send the carriage back if
I can, but if it is not here by half-past ten,
and I am unable to get a fly, I have no
doubt that Mr. Jarrett will kindly let
one of his men-servants see you safely
home."

I will see her home myself," said Bob
effusively, suddenly finding his tongue, now
that matters were definitely arranged
according to his desires.

All right, then ; I leave her in your
hands." And so saying Dr. Lankester
hurried off, leaving his daughter a prey

to a whole host of curiously mixed sensations.


In many ways the village doctor was a
strangely simple and unworldly man.
Despite his forty odd years, it apparently
never entered his head to think that there
was anything the least unusual in letting
Dot remain by herself, at a tolerably late
hour of niL,dit, in the house of a younfr
bachelor acquaintance who, most ordinary
people would have perceived, admired her
immensely.

He would have been astounded if anyone
had suggested such a tliinc.

But Dot's perceptions were sharper.

Her maidenly instincts rebelled against
the situation.

She knew the innocence and simplicity
of her father's nature, but for once she
wished that he possessed a little more of
that worldly cunning of which her mother
owned so large a share.

She liked Mr. Jarrett very much. He
was very kind, very nice, very polite. But
every now and then she had felt his eyes
fixed upon her in an embarrassing manner,
and once when she looked up, and happened
to intercept their gaze, there was
a look in them which troubled her not a
little.

She could not understand it, and Dot
Lankester was a vounj woman who did
not care for things she did not understand.



AN OFFER OF A "MOUNT."

Bob saw Dr. Lankester out at the hall
door as in courtesy bound ; and for a
minute or two Dot was left to her own
resources. During this time she took
herself seriously to task for her disinclination
to be left alone with Mr. Jarrett.
It really was ridiculous to mind, and it
would be doubly, trebly absurd to allow
him to guess that she experienced any
reluctance. She had already stated her
wish to accompany her father, but since he
had decided otherwise, the best plan now
was to try and appear totally unconcerned,
and altogether at her ease. Even delicacy
might be carried to too great an extent.

Luckily her conscience was free. The
situation had been none of her choosing,
and undoubtedly the wisest course was to
attach as little importance to it as possible.
In this manner did she argue, endeavouring,
by the aid of common sense and calm
reasonings, to make liiht of the whole
business. She succeeded so far that by the
time Bob re-entered the room she contrived
to smother the temporary resentment she
had felt against him, and to all appearances
was quiet, indifferent and self-possessed.
But she did not attempt to commence the
conversation, and for a few seconds a
somewhat awkward silence prevailed. If
Dot's conscience was at rest, Bob's was far
from being so. He could not divest himself
of an inward conviction that he had
behaved traitorously towards his guest.
Moreover he entertained an uncomfortable
belief that she shared the same opinion,
and in her inmost mind criticized his
VOL, II. 23

conduct severely. Well, he must try and
make up for past misdemeanours, and do
all he could to regain her esteem.

Dot had risen from her seat, and was
now standing leaning? with one arm against

DO O

the mantelpiece, in a pose full of unconscious
grace. The bright flames from
the fire cast flickering shadows on her
light dress and grave, downcast face. They
lit up her soft brown tresses with gleams
of gold, and made the small head and
slender pillar-like throat stand out in high
relief against the dark oak panelling.

A thrill went through Bob's frame as he

I

looked at her. She had no positive claim to
beauty, but her air of quiet refinement,
her youth, lier freshness, her total freedom
from coquetry, rendered her in his eyes
the most attractive woman he had ever
come across. He admired her immensely,
and yet he feared her a little. He doubted
the reception his advances might meet with.

Lie inspired an unusual sense of self-distrust
and timidity. Therefore lie resolved
to be more than commonly prudent,
to guard against any hasty impulse carrying
him away, and above all, to do and
say nothing that might directly or indirectly
give the alarm to her maidenly susceptibilities.
Miss Lankester and Lady De
JFochsey were evidently two very different
types of womanhood. The same plan of
procedure could not be indiscriminately
adopted with them both.

At last the silence grew so prolonged that
Bob was constrained to break it.

Will you not sit down. Miss Lankester ?''
he said in studiously correct tones. " You
will abet tired of standing." And he drew
the chair she had already occupied a trifle
nearer.

It must be owned that Dot did not
receive this suggestion very graciously.
Before replying she glanced at the clock ;

23*

then, with a suppressed sigh of impatience,
answered :

'' Yes, I suppose I may as well. The
carriage can't possibly be here just yet."

Bob felt nettled by the remark. It
implied a desire to escape at the very
earliest opportunity.

You seem in a most tremendous hurry
to get away," he said with considerable
asperity. " I am sorry that you should be
so awfully bored."

Dot blushed up to the very roots of her
hair.

Oh ! no indeed," she said lamely, " I'm
not the least bit bored."

Are vou'not ? Then all I can sav is,
your manner belies your words. Is there
nothing I can [do to amuse you ? Don't
you even care to look at books or photographs,
since you appear disinclined to
talk ? "

I don't want amusing, ]mr. Jarrett.

You labour under a mistake in fancying
that I do."

So you said before. But from personal
observation I am rude enough to disbelieve
the statement. If you were contented
where you are, you would not count the
minutes quite so anxiously."

You seem to forget," rejoined Dot,
with an attempt at archness, " that we
country people areearly birds, who become
sleepy and stupid unless we go to roost atour
accustomed hour."

Am] I .to understand, then, that you
retire to rest at half-past nine every day of
your life ? "

Well, no, not perhaps quite so early."

You are tired on this particular evening
? Is that it?"

No, not at all."

Not bored, not tired !," said Bob
musingly. " Then I can only arrive at one
solution."

He waited for a moment, as if hoping
his companion would inquire what it was,
but as she did not speak, he went on
more impetuously : " The fact of the matter
is, Miss Lankester, you still persist in
treating me like a stranger, from whom all
manner of evil is to be expected. Do you
imagine I am going to eat you ? " And he
turned a pair of very reproachful eyes upon
her, whose injured expression seemed to
render her shortcomings painfully apparent.

She gave a forced laugh, and blamed
herself for having been so ridiculously
prudish.

No. I do not Hatter myself that I
should prove a very palatable morsel ; and
as for bc4n<] a stram:][er  were you not one
only quite a short while ago ? "

Yes. It is kind of you to remind me
of the fact," he answered still, " though I
was in no danger of forgetting? it." Then,
determined not to quarrel with her, he

added in a gentler key : " It was my fault,
of course, but somehow or other when you
were so good as to help me through my gate
difficulty, I was foolish enough to imagine
that you were a little more human and
not quite so ceremonious as the rest of
them."

This time Dot laughed outright. His
remarks were extremely naive, and made
her begin to wonder why she had distrusted
him.

Come, Mr. Jarrett, confess. Do I look
very ceremonious at the present moment ? "
lying back in the arm-chair with a gesture
of abandonment, and resting her small
brown head against the cushions, whilst
her eyes shone with fun and mischief.

Both the words and the attitude pleased
him, and took away his sense of soreness.

No, I can't say that you do. But you
did a little while ago, when you were in

two minds about sitting down.

}>

And ("!o you really think me as bad as
the ' rest of them ' ? " mimicking his
aggrieved tones.

I shan't reply to that question, for fear
my answer might offend you," responded
Bob, his face beaming with delight, this
sudden transition to a playful mood making
the blood course like wildfire through his
veins. Then, with a strong effort he
controlled the desire to tell her his exact
thoughts, and said hesitatingly :

Of course you know very little about
me at present. Miss Dot  I beg pardon,
I mean Miss Lankester  but  but,"
beginning to flounder in his speech, " 1
should like to set your mind at rest in one
particular."

What is that, Mr. Jarrett ? I was not
aware my mind was uneasy."

Yes, it is. Excuse me for contradicting
you so flatly, but I can see it quite plainly.
The real truth is, you are afraid of me, and

and," turning very red, " upon my soul
you need not be."

The blush on her companion's face reproduced
itself on Dot's.

I'm not afraid of you  not a bit," she
vowed more emphatically than truthfully,
for she felt humiliated by Bob's declaration,
and by the keenness of his perceptions.

Oh ! I thought you were."

She plucked up sufficient courage to ask,
Why ? "

Because you showed so very plainly
your dislike to being left alone in my
society."

He had been piqued by her conduct, and
man-like could not conceal his pique as a
woman would have done. It might not be
wise to speak out thus freely on so short an
acquaintance, but for the life of him, he
could not hold his tongue.

Dot, however, felt too guilty to attempt
to deny the accusation. She only mar-veiled

at his powers of penetration, having
hitherto flattered herself that she had
managed to disguise her sentiments pretty
well. Either she must have acted her part
very badh% or Mr. Jarrett must be a good
deal sharper than most gentlemen.

Fortunately for Dot, Bob having secretly
enjoyed the confusion depicted upon her
countenance, was generous enough to start
the conversation afresh, and this time in a
different channel. He had no intention of
pressing her too sorely. His object had
merely been to let her see he was not
wholly devoid of observation. She was a
bad dissembler, and in his heart of hearts
he liked her all the better for it. A girl
who could tell stories readily, must have a
flaw somewhere in her composition.

Don't you ever go out hunting, Miss
Lankester ? " he inquired.

In a second. Dot's whole manner
changed. A wonderful thaw set in. All

the coldness and the frigidity vanished as
if by magic. They were on safe ground at
last, and she was her own, natural self
again. The need of defence, which constitutes
a maiden's armour, departed.

Oh ! yes, sometimes," she answered
vivaciously. " But not very often, I'm
sorry to say."

How's that ? "

Father won't allow me to go alone, and
it is only on very rare occasions that he
can steal a holiday."

Is Dr. Lankester fond of the sport ? "

He loves it, when he gets the chance.
Do you know," and Dot lowered her voice
confidentially, " nobody goes better than
father, when he happens to be mounted on
a decent horse, which, however, is not
often. Every one declares what a wonderful
eye he has got for a country, and
how marvellously quick he is in following
hounds."

And do YOU o where he does r "
inquired Bob with interest, though he did
not like the idea of Dot's delicate frame
being exposed to danger.

I used to always," she answered
proudly. " But," stifling a sigh, " the last
year or two poor Mouse has failed sadly.
She is very old and has quite lost her
speed."

Why don't you get another horse, then ?"
asked Bob somewhat inconsiderately.

She looked at him. Even the sharpest
men were curiously dense in some ways.

For the very simple reason, Mr. Jarrett,
that my father is, comparatively speaking,
a poor man, and we cannot afford to
indulge in many expensive amusements.
If we could, we should both go out
hunting a very great deal more frequently
than we do."

In short," said Bob, '' you have nothing
to ride but Mouse."

No, nothing, but I am very lucky to
have her, and it is only when hounds
happen to run really hard, and I hear her
poor heart go pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, under
me, and have the mortification of seeing
everybody pass me by, that I can't help
feeling annoyed, and envying people who
are better mounted than myself. It is so
delightful to be on a good horse," she continued
enthusiastically, " and not always to
have to think of cutting off corners, and
easing up hills, and walking through
ploughs. Besides, nothing puts one off
one's riding more, than following some
cunning old hand, who knows every gate
in the country, and who pulls up at each
gap in turn, to inquire of the multitude
what sort of a place it is, and then either
gallops swiftly away, or takes ten minutes
making up his mind whether he will or
will not, according to the nature of the
answers received. It ruins a person's nerve."

I should dearly like to lend you one of
my horses," said Bob eagerly. " There are
ever so many more in the stables than I
want for my own use, and I feel sure two
or three of them would carry a lady to
perfection."

Dot's face brightened at the mere suggestion.
She was passionately fond of
fox-hunting, and of everything connected
therewith. Her love of sport was genuine,
and inherited from her father, who came
of a good horse-racing Yorkshire family.
Bob could not possibly have held out a
greater temptation. Nevertheless, she had
many scruples as to accepting the offer so
generously made. To begin with, it would
place her under an obligation.

You are very kind, Mr. Jarrett," she
said gratefully. " More than kind, indeed,
to hint at such a thing ; but I do not think
my father would allow me to ride any one
else's horses. There is always a certain

amount of risk about the proceeding, and
if there was a 2:ood scent, and I crop warmed
up, I could not help ' going ' and doing my
very best to keep with hounds."

I'll take all the risk," he answered.
Come," persuasively, " what do you say ?
If I can succeed in overcoming Dr. Lankester's
objections, will you grant me this
small favour  for it is one, I assure you 
and let me have the pleasure of mounting
you now and again ? "

Dot hesitated before replying. It was
awfully nice of him, he was quite restored
to her good graces, but  ought she to
yield to the temptation however great it
might be, and was ? What was the use of
her cultivating her taste for hunting, when
the circumstances of her life were such
that in all probability she would have very
little opportunity of gratifying it hereafter.
And then Dot's imagination wandered faraway.


Well, what do you say ? " Bob asked
anrain. " Can't you make up your mind ? '*

She looked lira straight in the face with
clear and kindly eyes. She was touched
by the sincerity of his offer.

I don't know what to say, Mr. Jarrett,
except to thank you for your most generous
proposition."

But that is no answer, Miss Lankester.
None whatever."

It is the only one I can give at the
present moment."

May I speak to your father ? Have I
your permission ? "

I  I  think you had better not." And
she began twisting her pocket-handkerchief
about.

But in spite of these words, Bob could
see by her manner that she was yielding.
If he pressed the point only a little more
he would overrule her objections ; and
then  what cross-country delights, what

feats performed together, what long,
delicious rides home in the frosty twilight !
His pulses thrilled at the mere thought of
them. There would no longer be any
question of scheming to obtain a miserable
half-hour of her society. And when she
was pleased and amused, and owed her
pleasure and amusement to him, perhaps
she mio'ht orpow to care for him a little bit.

VOL. II.



BOB MAKES A BAD USE OF HIS OPPORTUNITY.

Can even the best of men help their
thoughts being selfish, especially when
their passions are aroused ? It is questionable.
At all events, there was a leaven of
self-interest in those that instantaneously
rose to Bob's mind. He could not refrain
from realizing that in benefiting Dot, he
would benefit himself a hundred thousand
times more. Consequently he grew increasingly
urgent.

"I shall attack your father the very next
time I see him," he said decidedly. " It's a
downright shame for you not to have a
good horse when you ride so well, and are
so fond of hunting."

His energy and determination quite
carried Dot away. She felt as if it were
almost impossible to resist them, when
directly subjected to their influence ; for
there are qualities which, when displayed
by one of the opposite sex, possess a
strange power of subjugating a woman,
even against her better judgment. She
likes to find all her objections answered,
all her scruples overruled just now and
again. It makes her say to herself ;
Well ! I have done a foolish thing, but
it really was not my fault. I had no
choice left me."

So instead of sticking to her colours, Dot
deserted them basely, and said with a faint
smile, for she was conscious of her weakness,
and condemned it :

I am afraid that if I let you have your
way, you will spoil me altogether, Mr.
Jarrett."

Spoil you! " he ejaculated. "By jingo!

24*

I only wish I had the chance. Should you
object to being spoilt by me, Miss
Lankester ? "

The question slipped out almost before
he was aware of it, and then he could have
bitten off the tip of his tongue, in his fear
of having gone too far.

It was almost a relief, and yet  with the
contrariety of masculine nature, he could
not help feeling vexed as well, to find no
reply forthcoming. Indeed, Dot appeared
not to have heard the interrogation. Her
face assumed an anxious, listening: expression.


"Hark," she said, ' is not that the sound
of wheels ? ''

No, I don't hear anything," rejoined
Bob shortly, wishing the expected conveyance
at the bottom of the sea.

I am almost sure it was the carriage,"
she said uneasily.

Oh ! never mind if it is. It is so

jolly sitting here talking, and there's no
hurry."

She began moving restlessly about the
room. Presently she said, unable to control
her impatience any longer ;

Mr. Jar ret t, I feel certain the carriage
is here. Would you mind ringing; the bell
and asking ? "

It was impossible to refuse so direct a
request. Bob reluctantly did her bidding,
and when the man-servant appeared, it
seemed that Dot's ears had played her
false. No vehicle had arrived.

Are you sure ? " she asked incredulously.


Yes, miss, quite sure. I looked out of

the 'all door myself just 'afore I came up."

"It's very odd," she said, rising to her

feet as soon as Charles had withdrawn.

Something must have happened, or else

father has forgotten all about me.

)>

That's not the least likely," said Bob.

Daughters can't be ignored altogether so
easily."

*' Well, anyhow, I must be going*'

He felt provoked by her persistence. It
showed him plainly that he had not
succeeded in setting her at ease.

Without exception," he exclaimed, half
in jest, half in earnest, "you are the most
fidgety and tenacious person I ever
encountered."

Thank you," she replied, dropping him
a mock courtesy. " Anything else ? "'

May I ask, Miss Lankester, how you

intend to get home ?

j>

She walked across the room, and drawing
the curtains a little aside, looked out of
the window. Just at first she could
distinguish nothing, but after a few
seconds she saw the stars shining vith
frosty radiance, and a big white moon
illumining all the heavens with her cold
and mystic rays. It might be a bit chilly

out of doors, but at any rate there was no
fear of rain. The night was calm and
still, the lawn already whitening over with
silvery hoar frost. Her resolution was
taken without delay. There could be no
reason why she should wait any longer.

1 shall walk."

By Jove ! No, that you shan't," he
protested.

Who is to prevent me ? " a spirit of
opposition rising within her breast.

I will. If you are really in earnest
about going, my brougham is of course at
your disposal."

Thank you very much," she rejoined,
in tones which he could not help fancying
conveyed a touch of reproach, " but it is
too late  now."

Without doubt, there was an emphasis on
the last word. The blood flew to his face.

Spare me," he cried, with impetuous
self-accusation. " I know quite well what

a beast I have been, and that 1 ought to
have ordered out the brougham ever so
lone a<]jo."

There was no law to render the action
obligatory" said Dot coldly.

Perhaps not, but I knew that you did
not like being left here, and wanted to get
away."

You need not blame yourself, Mr.
Jarrett. I stayed by my father's wish."

Yes, but I did all I could to keep you.
There ! now the murder is out." And Bob
gazed penitently at her. " Had I chosen,
I might have helped you out of your
difficulty in a second."

No doubt he had his faults, but he was
a good fellow, and honest to the core. She
could not feel angry with him for long,
especially when he looked so contrite for
what, after all, was only a small offence.
Besides, it was making a mountain out of a
molehill.

It seems to me," lie said pleasantly,
that if you have failed as a host, I have
failed as a guest, so we may as well cry
quits, and make our peace. Good-bye, Mr.
Jarrett." And she held out her hand.

You are not going to walk home,
surely ? " he said.

Yes, I am. It is only a step, and
nobody will run away with me."

I can't possibly let you go like this,"
he expostulated in genuine distress. " Do
wait a little longer."

Out of the question. It has already
struck half-past ten, and mother will be
wondering; what has become of us. She
does not know that father may have to
spend the night away from home."

Bob admitted the force of this objection,
and accompanied his companion down the
corridor that led to the hall. As he passed
a hat-stand he seized his hat.

What is that for ? " asked Dot.

*' To put on my head. I am coming
with you."

Oh, no, indeed, Mr. Jarrett ! I can't
allow you to do any such thing. You have
been to London to-day and are certainly
tired, and have a bad cold into the
bargain."

Excuse me, Miss Lankester, but you
must let me have my own way in this. I
have failed in my duty as a host once  you
yourself have just said so  and I hope it
may be a long time before I make a similar
mistake."

Dot was in consternation. To use a
vulgar simile, she felt that she had only
jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire.
And yet there was an air of decision about
Bob which effectually prevented her from
indulini]f in anv further remonstrances. It
was quite clear that whether she approved,
or whether she didn't, he intended to abide
by his decision. She liked him, too, in this

authoritative mood. The manliness of his
nature came out.

She actually let him wrap her up in one
of his great coats, and stood quite meekly
while he buttoned the buttons. He was
awfully slow about it, but she did not
attempt to hasten his movements. For the
time being he had gained a certain mastery
over her.

But when he handed her a warm shooting-cap,
and insisted upon her putting it on,
she once more found her tongue. He was
so portentously serious that she felt bound
to make light of the situation.

I declare," she said, looking saucily up
at him from under the projecting peak of
her head-gear, " you have turned me into
a regular man. How do I look ? Like a
master ? "

'' Look ! " he echoed, his head going
from him all of a sudden, " as you always
dc  charming."

She turned her head away, and said
petulantly :

For goodness sake, Mr. Jarrett, don't
treat me like a fashionable young lady, to
whom compliments are as the salt of existence.
I hate them  nasty, insincere
things."

But they are not always insincere,"
responded Bob in self-defence.

In that case, they are superfluous. And
now shall we make a start ? "

Bob's spirits felt thoroughly damped.
He did not offer to make any reply to this
speech. One thing was clear: Dot Lankester
wholly differed from the majority of
her sex. She was not to be approached
through her vanity. A strange girl this,
who grew positively angry when men professed
to admire her, but how charming a
one to the lucky fellow whose admiration
she might deign to receive. Bob wondered
if the " lucky fellow " existed, and grew

miserable at the mere thouclit. Then he
comforted himself by arguing that she was
so young. She did not look a day over
eighteen, and it was not likely in this quiet
country village that anybody had already
snapped her up. Besides, she did not seem
like a girl given to matrimony, but very
much the reverse. He should not take his
rebuffs quite so deeply to heart if he could
but make sure there were no rivals in the
field. The very idea of some great, hairy
man (other than himself) having the right
to put his arm round Dot's waist, and kiss
her little, flower-like face, filled him with
anofer and disgust. An Australian micrht
possibly be worthy of her, but an Englishman
 never !

Meanwhile they walked down the drive
in absolute silence.

The spreading trees with bare, black
twigs formed a canopy over their heads,
through whose interstices shone the darkling

sky, deep indigo in hue ; whilst the
cold stars glittered like diamond facets,
and the big moon cast sharp shadows on
the path, which made the white road even
whiter, when contrasted with their sombre
outlines.

Night, with its still serenity, had hushed
mother earth to sleep, and the stars and
moon and the pure vaulted sky guarded
the weary dame's slumbers. Peace descended
with the mystic frost, that touched
the trees with ghostly fingers and fantastically
laid on every blade of grass a hoary
rime which would have done credit to a
fairy's web.

Peace, and silence, and solemnity  these
were the characteristics of the hour, and
yet Bob's poor, passionate heart, that joy
or curse of human beings, beat with
tumultuous beats. Scarce could he stifle
his emotion. The calm of his surroundings
failed to quiet it. For  and a

great yearning flooded his being at the
thought  he was so near to her and yet
SO far !

So near  that if he stretched out his
hand, he could have taken hers in his ; sofar
 that in giving the slightest expression
to his sentiments, he at once raised up a
barrier between them. Once as they
walked along, she stumbled over some
fallen stone which lay in the road, and he
offered her his arm. Oh ! how he loosed
for her to take it  to feel her little wrist
quivering upon his sleeve.

He dared not speak, he only shot one
mute glance of appeal from his veiled and
troubled eyes.

She refused the proffered member with a
stately gesture of the head.

Bob literally trembled as he walked by
her side. It was ridiculous. He had
never been afraid of any one in his life
before. There were some who even

accused him of beintr an audacious flirt,
and yet this little slip of a girl, who was
hardly more than a child, rendered him as
timid and as hesitating as a hare just
startled from its form. If this was love,
surely he had taken the epidemic in a very
disagreeable form ; and if it were not love,
what else could it be ?

They continued down the avenue, until
they passed through the iron gates which
separated the Park from the village.
Emerging from the shadow of the trees
a flood of brilliant moonlight seemed them,
converting every homely red-brick cottage
into a veritable work of art.

It enveloped Dot's girlish form in one
sheet of radiance, and lit up each feature
of her expressive young face. Her companion's
attention was arrested by its rapt
and dreamy look. If his thoughts had
strayed, hers had evidently wandered also,
for she never even noticed his steed v gaze,

or heard the sigh with which, at last,
he forced himself to withdraw his eyes.

The influences of night prevailed. A
spell descended upon them both, though
it worked differently. He thought only of
her. She ?  Ah ! who can travel the paths
along which a maiden's fancies meander ?

Soon they stood under the rustic porch
of Dr. Lankester's house.

Then Dot woke up from her dream, and
gave a long, soft sigh.

"Is anything the matter?" said Bob
anxiously. " Are you cold ? '

Not a bit, thank you. I can't tell you
how I have enjoyed the walk home*'

I'm glad to hear it," he answered,
feeling flattered even in spite of the conviction
that her enjoyment was not attributable
to him.

"It has been such a lovely evening,
and  "lowering her voice, 'I was thinking


5)

VOL. 11. 25

Of whom ? He burned to ask the
question, but did not dare.

She gave herself a little shake as if to
shake her spirit free of some enchantment.

It is too late to ask you in," she said,
but I hope you will come another time."

"You have only to give the invitation
for me to accept it. Miss Lankester."

Then, as they were on the point of
parting, her conscience smote her for
having behaved a trifle ungraciously to
him. If only he could be brought to
understand, all would go well ; but she
could not offer her undivided friendship
until that point had been reached. In the
meantime she was sorry to have rendered
his evenings less agreeable than he had
anticipated.

She guessed this to be the case from his
altered and downcast manner.

Good night, Mr. Jarrett," she said
frankly. "I am afraid I have proved a

very bad companion. Will you forgive me
all my misdemeanours ? "

His lace brightened instantaneously.
The demand was put with such an air of
pretty penitence.

You have not got any shortcomings forme
to forgive."

' Under the circumstances, you are very
indulgent," she answered with a smile.

That smile was fatal. It made him
force all his cood resolutions. The blood
rushed up to his boyish face, and he said
impulsively :

It is pleasure enough for me to be
near you, even when you don't care to talk.
I should never ask for more."

And then he was frightened  frightened
at the effect his words would produce. Do
not laugh at him. The truest wooers are
often the most bashful.

Moonbeam after moonbeam poured into
the porch, as they stood waiting for the

25*

door to be opened. By their light he

could see her eyes narrow, the delicate

brow contract, and the whole expression

of her face change. He cursed his own

imprudence.

Mr. Jarrett," she said in a constrained

voice, " you expressed a wish that you and

I should be friends. Please understand

distinctly that I cannot undertake to

remain so unless you give up the habit

of making flowery speeches on every

possible and impossible occasion."

I  I'm awfully sorry," muttered Bob
in abject confusion, wringing her hand ina
vice-like grasp. " Good-bye, I won't doit
again, and  and  I shan't forget about
the horse," striding hastily awa3\

The horse ? Did he think he could
bribe her with that?

Mr. Jarrett," she called after him, in a
clear voice, " wait one minute, please. I
have something to say."

Yes," stopping short, " what is it ? "
About your kind offer  I  I can't
accept it."

"You cant! Why not?"
Because I feel convinced that it would
be better for me not to do so."

And with this exceedingly unsatisfactory
reply Dot vanished into the house, leaving
Bob to trudge back to Straighten Court in
the worst of humours and the lowest
possible spirits.

For he saw quite clearly that the fortress
was not to be carried by a coup de main.

In his ardour he had imagined there
would be no delay  his courtship would
go smoothly. He would pay Miss Lankester
a great deal of attention, to which
she would respond in a suitable manner ;
then propose and be accepted. That was
how the course of true love should always
run, and how he had mapped it out in his
own mind.

And now, instead of a swift impetuous
channel, coursing madly down towards the
smiling ocean of matrimony, he saw nothing
but a little devious stream, blocked
by every kind of impediment. His ideas
had been subjected to a very severe shock.

He realized that Dot Lankester could
not be " rushed " into marriage. He had
been in far too great a hurry. Instead of
going to work cautiously, and inspiring her
first with confidence, then friendship, and
finally with the desired passion, he had
made a mess of the whole business, and
done nothing' but establish a feelings of
constraint which would now take several
days, if not weeks, to efface. In short, he
had frightened her. He knew it by the
tone of her voice and the look of her eyes.
And as Bob retraced his footsteps he
blamed himself bitterly for having made
such exceedingly bad use of the opportunity
that had been granted him.

A SUNDAY CALL.

Whether a hapless young man be in love
or not the world has to go on as usual.
He must get up of a morning, eat, drink,
and, to a great extent, pursue his usual
avocations. The passion which consumes
him is sedulously hidden from the vulgar
eye, as something too sacred for it to gaze
upon. His sufferings are borne heroically
and in silence.

A promise made to a lady, even although
that lady be not the object of your affections,
is entitled to respect. An honourable
gentleman feels himself bound to fulfil it,
whether his inclinations do or do not
approve. Having pledged his word, there
is no coins back.

This conviction was strong upon Bob's
mind when Sunday afternoon arrived.
Since meeting Lady De Fochsey in the
train she had occupied but a comparatively
small share of his thoughts. Nevertheless
he remembered his appointment.

Consequently, he dressed himself with
extra care, and, after eating a hearty lunch,
set out on foot for her ladyship's house,
whose locality he had previously" ascertained.
He had gone to church that morning in the
hope of seeing Dot, but Dot for some reason
or other was not present, and he felt the
sacrifice had been vain, and wondered
feverishly when and how he should see her
again. If only he could catch a glimpse of
the doctor then he miiht arrange a dav for
his daughter to ceo out hunting ; but at
present the future was shrouded in
obscurity. He kept contriving all sorts of
plans by which they might meet. Most
successful projects in imagination, and yet

ones that when he came to meditate
seriously upon putting them into operation
seemed to contain some element which
might possibly displease Dot, and were
therefore promptly discarded. Four whole
days had passed since he had seen her. It
appeared a miracle how people could live
so close to each other, and meet so seldom.
And yet he had marched up and down the
road in front of the doctor's house at least
a dozen times. If this were to go on life
would not be worth livings.

Altogether, Bob felt thoroughly disheartened.
Since his immersion in the brook
he had not been well. He could not throw
off the chill which he had then caught, and
although he refused to take any care of
himself, and pooh-poohed the idea of taking
any medical advice, a sense of physical
discomfort added to the despondency of his
mental condition.

But the walk did him good. His way

led through pleasant country lanes, where
the thorny bramble still retained a few red
and yellow leaves, and where bright clusters
of scarlet berries peeped out from the dark
hedge-rows. A sharp frost had prevailed
the night before. In the shade the grass
was still covered by a silvery burden ; but
where the wintry sun rested upon it, there
the rime had disappeared, leaving behind a
faint trace of moisture, which lent freshness
to the herbage and appetite to the browsing
cattle. As a rule the StifTshire roads are
not celebrated for their cleanliness. The
rain that descends lies about in miry
puddles, and takes days to percolate through
the heavy clay soil. But to-day there was
no need to turn np even a trouser hem.
They were bleached quite white and hard,
except here and there where the sun had
chanced to slant down upon them with
peculiar force. The air was still and sharp ;
the sky faintly blue, fading away to a

misty grey where it touched the horizon.
Every now and again as he walked along,
the deep lowing of cattle, or the crisp swish
of grass torn violently from its roots, broke
the silence. Otherwise, scarce a sound was
to be heard.

Before long Bob arrived at his destination.


Lady De Fochsey's house was well
situated on the summit of a gentle incline.
Though by no means large  being, in
fact, little more than a hunting box  it
commanded a fine panorama. Grass, grass,
grass. That was what could be seen from
its bay windows, added to three or four
dark patches on the sky-line, which represented
well-known coverts, half a dozen
church steeples, and as many villages ; the
whole intersected by rows upon rows offences,
some big, some little, but mostly
the former, and all crossing and re-crossing
each other at a variety of different angles.

A great green chess-board, somewhat
irregularly marked out, but whereon all the
motley crowd of players enjoyed themselves
to the full. A country on which the fox-hunter's
eye rested with unqualified admiration
and approval, but in which the
uninitiated could descry nothing except a
series of big, drear' fields, bleak and bare
to a degree, and destitute of all beauty,
save that of space.

Bob marched up a bijou drive, planted
with trees that looked as if they ourht to
grow, but either couldn't or wouldn't, and
rang the bell.

Upon the door being opened he inquired
if her ladyship were at home.

Receiving an answer in the affirmative,
he was at once shown into a small but
luxuriouslv-furnished drawing-room, literally
crowded with feminine knick-knacks
and conceits. Books, flowers, music, bulrushes,
peacock feathers, Japanese fans.

screens, ornamental photograph stands,
china, grotesque monsters, &c., met the eye
in every direction. Last, but not least,
curled up on a white fur hearth rug before
the fire were two fat, wheezy pugs, with
huge blue satin bows tied round their
creasy necks, and, without compare, the
grotesque monsters of all.

Altogether, a room in which evidences of
female folly and female refinement were
curiously blended, producing a mixed
impression on the acute observer.

For a few moments Bob stood with his
back to the hearth  the pugs occupied the
central position, and he could only secure
one corner  familiar izins himself with these
various details, and trains' to determine
where the refinement ended and the folly
began. But this was a point not easily
arrived at, and requiring a much greater
critic on art furniture.

In justice to his taste, he did not wholly

approve of all he saw. lie had a man's
impatience of useless lap-dogs, and pugs in
particular, especially be-ribbon pugs ;
also of flimsy antimacassars, gimcrack
chairs, and little spindle-legged tables, that
had the horrid knack of over-turning on the
slightest provocation. Good, solid, sensible
furniture was what he liked ; not all these
three-cornered, new-fancied arrangements,
which blocked up a room and made people
afraid to move in it. These reflections
passed through his mind as he stood awaiting
her ladyship's arrival. She was a longtime
in coming ; and, impelled by curiosity,
he took to examining the various photographs
so liberally dotted about.

They were nearly all portraits of gentlemen
beloniainc to that class which Dot
Lankester would probably' have designated
as ' masters." The same vacuous expression
of self-content adorned the countenances
of them all. Their hair was parted down

the middle, and beautifully brushed ; their
coats were tightly buttoned over their
manly chests ; a pocket handkerchief invariably
protruded  presumably to let the
public know that the owner possessed such
an article  and in the matter of shirt-fronts,
curls, studs, sleeve-links, watch-chains
charms, rings, gloves and button-holes, they
were simply beyond reproach. As specimens
of what careful and elaborate dressing-can
do, they were " Things of beauty, a joy
for ever." Only not men. At least, so it
seemed to Bob. There was an air of
effeminacy about these mute reproductions
of living objects which made him turn away
from them in distrust. He felt an irresistible
desire to divest the originals of some of
their smoothness and gloss, and meet them
in a fair stand-up fight.

Continuing his tour of examination, he
came upon a photograph of Lady De Foch-
sey  the only female one in the room 

wliicli lie remarked with some wonderment.
She was depicted in full evening
costume, extremely recollected, standing
beside a marble column, with both hands
clasped tragically behind her head, thus
boldly calling attention to the seductive
curves of her graceful figure.

Bob looked long and critically at this
masterpiece of the photographic art, coldly
ascertaining the lady's good and bad
points, and dissecting each feature with
cynical composure. Lady De Fochsey's
eves were fie, her nose small and straight,
her mouth passable, a trifle thin-lipped,
but otherwise unobjectionable. No doubt,
as the world goes, a very pretty woman ;
and yet although he admitted her beauty,
it was a face that possessed no fascination
for him. The expression spoilt it. It was
artificial, unreal and insincere.

He had just arrived at this conclusion,
when a rustling of skirts was heard outside

in the passage. He glanced at the clock.
She had kept him waiting exactly twenty
minutes. Luckily, time was of no particular
importance, else he might have felt
more aggrieved than he did. The afternoon
had to be whiled away somehow.

At the near approach of their mistress,
the pugs began to display a slight animation
outside their own immediate circle of
interests, represented by the fire and the
hearthruo. The youngest and slimmest
half rose from her recumbent position ; the
eldest condescended to cease snoring, and
gave vent to one or two short, snappy
barks, that might mean satisfaction, but
which certainly sounded more like irritation
at the entry of a second intruder.

Lady De Fochsey appeared on the
threshold, clad in an exquisite toilette of
dark blue velvet, which set off her golden
locks, azure eyes, and pink and white
complexion to perfection. She had not
VOL. ir. 26

lived twenty-eight, nearly twenty-nine,
years in the world without learning the
art of making the most of herself.

Bob had promised to come early, and he
had been even better than his word ; inconsequence
of which, her ladyship, instead
of being already seated in state to receive
her Sunday afternoon visitors, found herself
compelled to struggle into the velvet
gown in a desperate hurry and slur over
those last delicate touches of rouge, which,
when artistically applied, added so greatly
to her appearance. Not that the rouge
had been omitted, only her cheeks were
rather more hectic than usual, and consequently
required a subdued light.

But her drawing-room was so arranged
that this could easily be obtained.

A thousand pardons for keeping you
waiting such an unconscionable time, Mr.
Jarrett," she exclaimed effusive, holding]:
out both her white bejewelled hands with

a pretty foreign air of apology. " I was
just finishing a letter to a soldier cousin of
mine, at the Cape, when you were announced,
and thought you would be good
enough to excuse me for a few minutes.
These foreign letters are always rather an
undertaking. One has to cram so much
news into them, and has to rack one's
brains to find the wherewithal."

This letter to the soldier cousin was a
most gratuitous invention on Lady De Foch-
sey's part, but it sounded better than telling
the truth, which would have been

"Ahem! Mr. Jarrett, I'm sorry to have
kept you so long, but I had to go upstairs
and dress, and my frock was awfully tight
and wouldn't meet, and then, just when we
succeeded in fastening it, one of the buttons
went crack, and my maid had to hunt for a
needle and thread to sew it on assail."

Of course the soldier cousin was infinitely
preferable to such a plain unvarnished tale

2r)*

as that. Women were nowhere if they did
not surround themselves with illusion.
All admiration  all love was illusion really,
only of a pleasant kind.

But if Bob had been annoyed by the
delay, he was courtier enough not to show
his vexation, and proved quite equal to the
occasion. He declared to her ladyship
that he would willingly have waited all
day, if only to obtain a glimpse of her.

She smiled benevolently at him, pulled
down the blinds three or four feet, seated
herself with her back to the licht, and
motioned to him to occupy the vacant
place on the sofa by her side. Evidently
she was determined to make amends for
liavimr detained him so lonc.

DEVELOPING PSYCHIC FORCE.

*' There ! Sit down, do," she exclaimed
coaxingly. '' You great tall men seem
such a terribly long way off a poor little
woman like me that I declare it's downright
hard work having to crane one's
neck up at jou. For my part, I never can
talk, unless a person be close to me."

It assists conversation, certainly," said
Bob. " I shouldn't think, though, that
anybody could have the moral courage to
place any great distance between himself
and so charming a lady. I know I can't."
And he plumped down almost on the top
of the blue velvet skirt.

Oh ! you sad flatterer," she murmured

cofjuettislily. " How am I to believe
you?"

By looking in the glass. Surely you
see corroboration of the truth there."

Yes, of several rather unpleasant ones,"
she thought to herself, but she did not say
so aloud.

And what have you been doing since
we last met ? " inquired Bob after a slight
pause.

I have gone through a variety of the
most wonderful experiences, Mr. Jarrett ;
I feel as if I had only just begun to live,
in the proper and enlightened sense of the
word."

Indeed ! That sounds very mysterious.
How did you make so remarkable a discovery
? "

Do you remember my telling you
about my friend Mrs. St. John, and the
seance that was to take place at her
house ? "

"Yes, perfectly. I have the keenest
recollection of it," answered Bob.

Well, I spent the most creepy, delightful,
and blood-curdling evening I ever
spent in my life, and all owing to that dear
man. Monsieur Adolphee De Fidus. Do
you know him by any chance ? "

"Not I. Who is he?"

Impossible. You don't actually mean
to say that you have not even heard of
him. Well, you are behind the times."

*' Very likely. It strikes me one would
have to be uncommonly rapid to be before
them now-a-days. But with all due respect
to your ladyship, you have not yet gratified
my curiosity."

Adolphee De Fidus  isn't it a romantic
name? just the sort of name you expect
great things of  is the head of the powerful
modern school of electrical, esoteric and
spiritualistic psychology."

Dear me ! And what wonders did this

first-class conjuror perform ? " ejaculated
Bob.

"Elevations into space, even of common
objects like a chair or a table," she responded
in tones of intense excitement.
Mysterious rapping proceeding from the
spirits with whom he holds communication,
invisible writing, and many other marvellous
manifestations besides. I confess
that I went to my friend's house somewhat
sceptically inclined, but I came away a
complete convert."

It's awful hard lines upon the poor
spirits," said practical Bob.

In what way, Mr. Jarrett? "

Why, I fancy that one of the chief
ideas of our mortal minds in connection
with a future state is represented by repose.
We associate the hereafter with rest and
freedom from worry. Now, according to
your friend Monsieur Adolphee, the unfortunate
beings who have departed this

world and gone to another, are little better
off than general servants."

"Eeally, Mr. Jarrett. What extraordinary
things you do say."

Well, but is it not so ? These poor
spirits are at everybody's beck and call.
A little shoeblack, cleaning his shoes in the
gutter, displays mediumistic tendencies, and
he may summon the celestial form ; also
the tradesman, also the farmer, also nine
people out of ten. To me there is something
revolting in the very idea."

Ah ! " sighed her ladyship. " You
speak like one who does not understand.
As Monsieur Adolphee truly observed the
other night, ignorance and dulness of the
amer perceptions are our greatest enemies.
I wish you could meet him. He would
soon alter your opinions."

I doubt it," said Bob obstinately.

Oh ! yes, indeed he would. No one
can resist him. He has cultivated this soul

to such an extent that he is now nothing
but a mass of psychic force."

I'm afraid I'm rather dense, but will
you tell me exactly what those words
mean? At present they convey nothing
definite to my mind."

Dear ! how sad ! " exclaimed Lady De
Fochsey, clasping her hands tlieatricall3\

Is it ? I look to you to enlighten me."

Of course, ' psychic force ' means ever
so many things," she explained somewhat
vaguely.

All right," interposed Bob. " I'll take
that for granted."

And it is simply impossible to go into
detail, when one is treating so stupendous
a subject," she went on, wishing she could
but recall some of Monsieur Adolphee's
long words and high sounding phrases.
People must have faith  yes, faith first
and foremost, and then it all comes to
them in time."

Again I must ask you to forgive my
stupidity, but what comes, Lady De
roche."

Oh ! all sorts of things, as I told you
before. It is so difficult to explain, but
clairvoyance, and thought-reading, and 
and spiritual interchanges with the souls of
those who are dead."

"Very jolly if you met your dearest
friend, but quite the reverse if some
horrible wretch you were only too glad to
get rid of kept always cropping up," said
Bob. " Did you receive any messages

from Monsieur Ad I mean from the

spirits."

Yes, several."

"And what sort of messages were they ?"

"Delightful ones. Hoped I was welland
looked forward to seeing me. One
poor man I used to be very fond of in the
olden days sent me quite a long letter ;
and, oh! so beautifully worded."

It is curious that the language should
be the same," remarked Bob. "Do the
spirits ever make any mistakes in orthography
? "

How can you ask such a question ?
It's really quite shameful. I'll not tell you
anything more if you talk like that."

Oh ! yes, do. I want to hear all about
Monsieur Adolphee ; I am an unbeliever
now, I admit, but if any one can convert
me, I feel sure you can." And, whether
by accident or design, Bob's hand came in
contact with Lady De Fochsey's, and she
did not withdraw hers immediately.

Ah ! " she said, " I wish I were good at
explaining things, but I'm not, although
perhaps I may get to be a more worthy
disciple by degrees, for Monsieur Adolphee
says that if only I cultivate my powers
assiduously, and run up to town occasionally
for the purpose of receiving his
advice, in time I "

All of a sudden lie stopped short, and
fixed her eyes rapturously upon Bob, with
the air of one who has just made a great
and exceedingly important discovery.

What is the matter ? " he asked, feeling
rather uncomfortable at being stared at so
pointedly.

Just fancy ! " she exclaimed ecstatically.
You are  yes, you really are "

I am  I really am  what ? "

A medium, my dear boy. Oh ! you
lucky  lucky young man, let me congratulate
you." And in her rapture her golden head
almost sank upon his shoulder, only, as
one side of her fringe felt a little loose,
she had to be careful, and he profited by
the opportunity to edge a few inches farther
away.

Bah ! " he exclaimed contemptuously,
but not politely.

Oh ! it's no use saying ' Bah ! ' " she
rejoined. " The fact remains, and you

can't help yourself. You possess strong
magnetic powers. I can tell by your eyes,
though I don't know yet whether you'll
develop into a medium of the first or only
the second order. That depends chiefly
upon yourself."

"In that case I shan't develop into
either."

But you must. The process is unconscious,
and it may so happen that your
individual will has not much to do with it,
especially if you come under the influence

of a  of a " but as she could not find

the exact word, she broke ofl" short, and
said softly  "Oh! Mr. Jarrett, I am so
glad, so very vers glad. This was precisely
what I wanted."

What are you glad about ? " he asked
somewhat roughly, beginning to wonder
if she had gone ofl' her head altogether.

You don't quite understand at present
but I'll try and make it all clear to you.

Monsieur Adolph explained to nie most
particularly the system by which the
magnetic current is transmitted. It is
enough, he says, for two people who both
possess spiritual aptitudes to meet once or
twice a week, and sit for a couple of hours
at a time holding; hands, and looking
steadily into one another's eyes, for them
insensibly to gain power."

Good heavens ! " ejaculated Bob.
What next, I wonder ? "

But the curious part is this," resumed
her ladyship, with a pensive smile. "It
seems that the process is greatly assisted,
and the cultivation of internal force immensely
facilitated, when the two mediums
are of opposite sexes. For instance  a man
and a woman will arrive at much speedier
results than a woman and a woman, or a
man and a man."

"Yes, I can understand that," said Bob,
with blunt sarcasm.

All ! you are beginning to comprehend
at last," she rejoined, in satisfied tones. " I
thouLflit you would before long;. These
things just require a little explanation at
first starting, but they are not as difficult
as they seem, between two people who are
really sympathetic."

That's comforting, at any rate."

Yer}, is it not ? And now, Mr.
Jarrett, what do you say ? Will you
try?"

"Try what, Lady De Fochsey? You
speak in conundrums."

Firstly, to develop sour higher nature
and kill the baser."

Is that all ? And pray, how am I to
set about it ? "

I'll show you. You have only to do as
I tell you."

So saying she jumped up from the sofa,
dracced the cover off a small rosewood
table that stood in the window, lifted it onto

the hearth rug, and then proceeded to
place two cane chairs one on either side of
it. Bob watched these operations with
amazement.

Stow sit down," she said impatiently.

He did as he was told, too much mystified
to venture on an observation.

That's right, Mr. Jarrett. Give me
your two hands."

Won't one do ? "

No, I must have both."

He held them out obediently, feeling
somewhat like a captive.

Now take mine in yours  so, and press
them firmly."

At this request Bob revived. He lost no
time in complying with it. Indeed, he
began to consider the situation great fun.
They were quite close to each other, their
knees almost touched, and only the small
table separated them.

Bat her ladyship was not satisfied yet.
VOL. II. 27

*' Look straight into my eyes," she said,
with preternatural gravity, " and after a
time tell me what you see."

There's no occasion to wait. I see a
very pretty woman," replied Bob audaciously.


Hush ! You must not speak yet. It is
too soon."

How long am I to keep quiet ? I
never bargained for having to play mum-chance."


You must judge by your own feelings ;
probably about a quarter of an hour."

"Very well," replied Bob. " But before
we begin this game in earnest  for I
presume it is a game  may I venture to
make a suiifoestion ? "

*' Yes, if you are quick about it, but
don't be long, for the conditions are favourable,
and it's a thousand pities not to profit
by them."

From what I gather' said Bob gravely

our present object is to strengthen and
transmit the magnetic force which we  or
rather you  believe we both possess. Now
at this moment there is but one point of
contact between us. Time electric current
passes through our hands, and. our hands
alone. Don't you think  I make this
suggestion with all due diffidence  that if
you were to put out your pretty little feet
and I were to put out mine, the effect
might be enormously intensified ? We
should then secure a negative and a positive
pole."

She sighed gently.

Yes, Mr. Jarrett, per  perhaps you are
right."

I'm sure of it," said Bob confidently.

"And now to business," she said.
'' Keep on pressing m} hands and looking
into my eyes, and if, by the end of a
quarter of an hour, you begin to feel
peculiar sensations, swear to describe them,

27*

as I swear to describe mine. Only don't be
disappointed if we fail to produce any
active manifestations to-days, since it is
absolutely necessary first to establish
harmonious relations."

Bob laughed heartily.

All right," he said. " Your orders
shall be obeyed."

And then, for fifteen whole minutes
neither of them spoke a word.

The clock on the mantelpiece ticked
away industriously, and those two abominable
pugs snored on louder than ever.

Now, to have free leave given you to
press a pretty woman's hand, and a woman
moreover, not disinclined for flirtation, is a
permission of which most men would take
liberal advantage. To do Bob justice he
was by no means backward in doing so.
But squeezing hands surreptitiously and
from impulse, and squeezing hands by
command, are two very different things, as

before long he began to discover. For
TV lien you are enjoined to continue the
pressure at all hazards, then the temptation,
and, sui rosa, sense of enjoyment, vanishes,
until in the end you become only conscious
of an irksome effort. If any gentleman
doubts this fact, let him try the experiment
for himself.

For the first five minutes Bob's fancy
was amazingly tickled. He discovered that
the lid of one of Lady De Fochsey's eyes
drooped more than the other, that the rims
beneath them were not natural, and that
the eyes themselves, when critically
examined, were wholly wanting in
expression. But the next five minutes,
he began to feel rather bored, and suffered
from an irresistible desire to yawn, which
desire, however, he could not gratify, being
unable to withdraw his hand. The last
found him growling and grumbling
inwardly and voting the whole thing " a

most deuced bore." He made a mental
vow, never to squeeze a woman's hand as
long as he lived. The nerves of his arm
had grown quite dead. At length, to his
infinite relief, the quarter struck.

Well ! " murmured Lady De Fochsey,
who appeared in a dreamy and semi-hypnotic
state. " How do you feel? "

Oh ! awfully jolly," responded Bob, not
wholly veraciously, but thankful to be
allowed the use of his tongue aiain.
How do you ? "

Strange  very strange. I have indescribable
sensations. Do sou see anything
? ''

Earlier," he answered, his sense of the
ridiculous assuming the upper hand.

Oh ! what ? Tell me what."

I sec "  and he lowered his voice to a
mysterious key  " visions of fair disembodied
women, floating about in spirit
space. Waves of ether surround them.

They are free from every coarse and earthly
element "

*' Yes, yes, go on," she interrupted.
** This is really wonderful, especially at the
first attempt. It proves that you possess
most special gifts."

One gracious form beckons me to
draw near," continued Bob, still more
dramatically. " She whispers that she has
waited long, so long for my coming."

Just like me," sighed her ladyship.

Yes, just like you. She says that our
communications require strengthening 
that I amtoo"far off. Ha! she bids me,
with ethereal condescension, encircle her
diaphanous and well-nigh invisible waist,
with my grossly mortal arm." Here Bob
proceeded to clasp Lady De Fochsey's
tightly-laced one, the lady offering no
resistance. How could she? When he
was a medium, and was producing such
lovely manifestations.

My kindred spirit," she murmured,
my kindred spirit, at last  at last."
Then, abandoning herself completely to
the ecstasy of the moment, she added
deliriously, " Is that all ? "

Oh ! dear no. Would you believe it,
my spiritual adviser actually commands me
to press my mundane lips to her chaste
ones. She does not even recoil from the
thought of possible contamination, but
offers me a draught of purest nectar."

To what length Bob's audacity and
irrepressible spirit of mischief would have
led him it is impossible to say. Suffice it,
that his arm was still round her ladyship's
waist and her head was within suspicious
proximity to his own, when suddenly the
door flew open, and Lord Littelbrane was
announced. The aspirants after psychic
force started apart.

No further manifestations could be
expected to take place in the presence of

a third, and probably uncongenial, party.
Lady De Foclisey gave a little startled
scream, and alas ! alas ! the powerful
electric current which had been so successfully
established between herself and Mr.
Jarrett was rudely broken.

But that it had been established was
conclusively proved by the shock felt on
either side at its unexpected and inopportune
rupture.

None but male and female mediums
could possibly have arrived at such sterling
results in so short a space of time.

If the height of clairvoyance had been
reached in one single seance, what might
not be hoped for at the next meeting ?

To the earnest believer in psychology,
delightful and never-endin]j fields of
research were open. Guided and impelled
by the glorious spirit, the body might take
care of itself. That vile earthly thing was
of no account.

AN UNTIMELY Interruption.

It took a good deal to disturb Lady De
Foclisey's self-possession ; but for a few
seconds after the announcement of Lord
Littelbrane lie was fairly staggered.

Her mind had been filled with all kinds
of rare and transcendental ideas. It was
uplifted and exalted in quite an uncommon
degree. Her spirit was just ready to soar
amongst astral planes and undertake a
celestial voyage of discovery, and now, aU
of a sudden, she was called upon to attune
herself to things terrestrial. It was like
being bound by some horrid chain that
rudely pulled you back to earth. Her
discomfiture was increased, too, by the fact

that, amongst the whole circle of her
acquaintance, his lordship was the very
last person whose presence she expected.
No thought of him had entered her head ;
for, although she had already spent two
whole hunting seasons in Stiffshire, he had
never once condescended to call, or to set
foot inside her house ; and this in spite of
sundry friendly little invitations issued by
her hi the beo[innino\

Beyond a few stereotyped remarks out
hunting, confined almost exclusively to the
weather and the sport, no civilities had
been exchanged between them. After a
time her innate sense had told her that this
was a man on whom feminine fascinations
and blandishments would produce but little
effect. It was wiser to reserve them for a
more sensitive and emotional individual.

So she had almost given up the attempt
of trying to enrol his lordship amongst the
list of her admirers, and contented herself

with being on speaking terms  nothing
more.

Consequently she was now at a loss to
understand to what the honour of this visit
was due. Her brain was too distraught to
divine any possible motive.

But if, for once in her life, Lady De
Fochsey felt slightly disconcerted, Lord
Littelbrane was a hundred thousand times
more so. His notions about ladies and
their behaviour were strict, not to say old-fashioned,
and he had seen enough to shock
him very considerably. There could be
no two opinions as to the familiarity of the
positions in which the parties had been
surprised. If he could have withdrawn
without saying a word, most assuredly he
would have done so. But it was too late
now to effect an escape ; therefore, after
an awkward pause, he advanced a little
way into the room, and turning very red
in the face, said.

"I beg pardon. I fear I am intruding."


At these words Lady De Foclisey called
all lier forces into action. She felt that
the moment was critical  that, in fact, her
whole character might depend upon it. A
very pretty story could doubtless be
trumped up at her expense, and circulated
all over the hunting-field. In some way
or other she must account for the entire
business, and in a manner, moreover, that
would completely remove his lordship's
displeasure. The task was by no means
easy. There were a good many facts
against her, but she did not despair. Her
babyish blue eyes, and innocent pout, and
childish speeches which professed no harm
in anything had stood her in very good
stead before now. Besides, in spite of his
stillness and reserve, she did not believe
Lord Littelbrane to be either a very strong
or a very acute man. She thought that it

might not prove altogether difficult to
throw (lust in his eyes.

Therefore she held out her hand almost
affectionately, and said with great apparent
unconcern :

Intruding ? Oh ! dear no. How could
sou possibly imagine such a thing, my
lord ? Mr. Jarrett and I were merely
trying to repeat some spiritualistic experiments
which I saw the other night, and
which required a certain juxtaposition of
the electrical forces."

She was very good at long words. She
picked them up like a parrot, and introduced
them regardless of their meaning.
But they sounded well  learned, scientific
and so on ; and, to tell the truth, his lordship
was a little impressed.

Oh I indeed," he responded. " And
are these experiments confined exclusively
to yourself and this  " he was oinf to
say gentleman, but checked himself and

substituted " young man," without, however,
dei(?ninfT to look at Bob.

She smiled up into his face with the
frankness of a child.

Of course not. We were lon2:in2 fora
third person to assist our efforts. Will
you join us?" and she smiled even more
sweetly than before.

He was mollified, but not sufficiently so
to accept the invitation.

No, thank you. I am afraid your
experiments are not much in my line."

She looked at him oddly, wickedly,
alluringly.

Oh ! how cruel. Won't you even
try ? "

Thanks ; I think not. At all events,"
lovering his voice, " not in the present
company."

Ah, I understand. But," shrugging-her
shoulders, " it was simply a case of
faute de niisuxy

I am field to hear it. I feared it micrlit
be otherwise."

What ! with your experience ? " Then
she rested her hand on his coat-sleeve, and
said in a louder key, " Dear Lord Littel-brave,
you must really let me initiate you
into some of the mysteries of the higher
life. I do not profess to be an adept, but
we might try and cultivate our souls
together. I feel sure there is sympathy
between us."

The last ' remnants of his ill-humour
vanished. He felt infinitely flattered and
raised in his own esteem. Only he could
not unbend as loncf as that " duller "  that
nephew of Straighten's remained in the
room. lie wondered why on earth the
fellow did not go ; and although he was
not going to demean himself by talking to
him, he might talk at him, and convey a
pretty broad hint as to the desirability of
his prompt departure.

'' I think so also," lie said, addressing
Lady De Foclisey pointedly, ' but sympathy
requires a tete-astute. Don't you agree with
me ? "

Ah ! yes, of course. Do you hear that,
Mr. Jarrett ? "

Bob marvelled inwardly at her impudence
 " brass," he dubbed it mentally.
But he had no desire to stay any longer
and be scowled at by Lord Littelbrane, so
he took up his hat, and, moving towards
Lady De Foclisey, said abruptly :

Good-bye. I must be going."

Must you really ? " she asked, in
accents which seemed to say, " Quite right.
1 think you had much better, for 3'ou have
had your innings, and now should make
room for another." Then, turning to Lord
Littelbrane, she said :

Excuse me one moment, my lord."

He bowed stiffly in response. Up till
now he had resolutely abstained from taking
VOL. II. 28

the slightest notice of Bob, and desired to
avoid an introduction, so lie turned his
back upon him and walked to the window,
and stood gazing vacantly out at the green
fields and browsing sheep.

Meantime Lady De Fochsey accompanied
Bob to the door.

Was there ever such an untimely interruption
? " she whispered confidentially.
I declare I could have boxed his lordship's
ears."

Hush ! he will hear you."

"I don't care if he does. He has spoilt
our afternoon."

Bob could not help feeling rather disgusted
with her hypocrisy'. He was convinced
in his own mind that no sooner did
he leave the house than she would make upto
Lord Littelbrane, precisely as she had
made up to him.

His coming was awkward, certainly,"
he admitted. '* And i feel sorry on your

account, as I fear you were placed in a
rather disagreeable situation, and partly
through my instrumentality."

Oh ! never mind about me, I'll soon
smooth old ' Stick-in-the-mud ' over. But,
I say, Mr. Jarrett  Bob  I must call you
Bob, Mr. Jarrett sounds so formal."

Well, what is it. Lady De Fochsey ? "

You will keep our manifestations
strictly secret, won't you ? It would not
be wise to mention them to an ignorant
and unsympathetic public."

Of course not," said Bob, repudiating
the idea of recounting his folly. " You
mays trust me to hold my tongue, especially
where so many universal truths are concerned."


That's right. I knew I could depend
on you ; and, Bob  when will you come
again r

She might have been a girl of eighteen,
proud in the possession of her first lover

28*

and confident of her powers of attraction ;
but her eagerness repulsed him. It wanted
the charm of extreme youth.

"I really can't say," he rejoined coldly.
It depends entirely on what's going on."

Come soon, there's a dear creature. We
ought to join hands again in three or four
days' time at latest, else the magnetic
current may evaporate."

"Perhaps it would be just as well tolet
it, all things considered."

Nonsense. You must not talk like
that. To-day's sitting has conclusively
proved that we are indispensable to one
another. You can only rise through my
instrumentality, and I through yours. We
have each a mission to perform, which should
render us superior to personal feeling."

And what will be the end of it all ? " he
inquired with languid interest.

End ? Why, in course of time we maybe
able to raise the chairs and tables from

their places and suspend them in mid-air.
We may get to hold an ordinary pencil in
our hands, and find long spirit-messages
written upon a slate ; we may even see the
forms of the departed hovering about our
heads and whispering divine words of love
and comfort. Surely you cannot entertain
any doubts after the results we have obtained
to-day? They were so absolutely
conclusive."

I don't know. They seemed to me to
be purely mundane results at best. If they
contained any divine element, the spirits
must be very naughty people."

That is because you have a mundane
mind. We both have at present ; but by
degrees we shall grow out of all that, and
disencumber ourselves of every earthly
attribute."

"I doubt it," said Bob, sceptically.
Earthly attributes have a nasty way of
sticking."

And with that he effected his escape,
and did not breathe freely until once more
he found himself outside in the open air, inhaling
the clear frosty atmosphere, instead
of the languorous flower-laden perfumes of
Lady De Fochsey's drawing-room.

"Phew!" he exclaimed, with a quick
outward breath, as if to shake off every
reminiscence of his visit, " was there ever
such a pack of nonsense ? Eeally, it makes
one wonder what next women will be upto
now-a-days. Every new craze, no
matter how foolish, finds converts amongst
the fair sex."

Then he walked on a step or two, and
added, with a growing sense of self dissatisfaction
:

I wonder what the deuce Dot would
say if she knew what an infernal fool I've
been making of myself. I shouldn't like
her to hear how I've spent my Sunday
afternoon."

Meanwhile Lady De Fochsey applied
herself to the entertainment of her remaining
guest. He had felt annoyed by her
prolonged conference with Bob, and she
found him looking very cross and consequential,
like a bird whose feathers have
been ruffled the wrong way.

Ten thousand pardons," she exclaimed
in her prettiest and most penitent manner.
That young man promises to develop into
a dreadful bore. He has fastened himself
upon me, and really I hardly know how to
get rid of him."

This was an entirely new aspect of
affairs, and one infinitely more pleasing to
Lord Littelbrane.

If what she stated was true, and she
was being persecuted by an impudent
stranger, he was more or less bound to
step in and protect her from further inconvenience.


You are much too good-natured," he

said, " and should not allow yourself to be
imposed upon."

She sighed, and drooped her eyes in a
timid, feminine fashion that she knew how
to assume on occasions.

Ah ! Lord Littelbrane, your advice is
excellent, no doubt ; but \yhat is a poor
single woman in my position to do ? She
does not like to be downright rude, and yet
on the other hand she is more or less at the
mercy of every man she comes across."

How did you first get to know this Mr.
Jarrett ? " he asked, seating himself in the
place recently occupied, by Bob.

I met him out hunting. You remember
the day he tumbled into the
brook ? "

Do you mean to say that he had the
impertinence to speak to you r "

I dropped my hunting crop and he
opened a gate for me. I was obliged to say
thank you ! "

And on the strength of that the fellow
has actually had the cheek to come and
call. Well! I never."

She did not contradict him, and left his
lordship under the impression that Bob had
forced his acquaintance upon her. It was
a little mean, perhaps, not to tell the truth,
but it saved an infinity of trouble ; and
really, if one were to try and stick up for
all one's friends in their absence life would
become a perfect burden. To be nice to
them when they were present was the
extent of what she could undertake.

And what about this spiritualistic
business ? " inquired Lord Littelbrane suspiciously.
" Did your friend Jarrett start
the idea ? "

Well, no, not exactly. I proposed it
at first in fun, and because I did not know
what on earth to do with him. And then
as you might have seen  but really I hardly
like to tell you."

And she turned her head away coyly,
and gazed pensively at one little slippered
foot.

' Yes, yes, go on," entreated her companion,
whose curiosity was thoroughly
aroused.

Well, then, the young man grew
shockingly familiar. I was just going to
ring the bell and bid the servant show him
out, when you came in. You may imagine
my feelings of relief."

This was a very strange story, concocted
on the spur of the moment, but stranger
still, Lord Littelbrane believed it. From
that instant he saw before him a beautiful
and injured woman, whose natural modesty
had been grossly outraged.

Next time I meet the brute I'll punch
his head," he exclaimed vindictively,
knowing, however, that he would do no
such thing, except b} deputy.

Oh ! No, indeed, my lord, you must

not be so fierce. Mr. Jarrett misconducted
himself a little certainly, but then you see
he is a medium, and mediums are always
entitled to a certain licence."

Hem ! And pray how do you get to bea
medium ? "

In a great many different ways."

"Do you think you could make me one?
I should rather like to acquire a few
privileges in your case."

I don't know. I've never had the
chance of ascertaining whether I could or
whether I couldn't."

Will you try. Lady De Fochsey ? "

He spoke so gravely that she suspected
some serious intention.

With pleasure, my lord, provided you
really wish it."

LADY DE FOCIISEY CHOOSES BETWEEN HER
WORLDLY AND SPIRITUAL LOVERS.

Lord Littelbrane had come there that
day charged with a desperate purpose, and
bent on fulfilling a design which he had
only formed after long self communing and
inward cogitation. The presence of Mr.
Jarrett  the pose in which he had discovered
him  had shaken his intention,
but not wholly destroyed it. An explanation
had, however, been forthcoming,
which he considered satisfactory. The
lady was to be pitied, not blamed, as in his
haste he lead imagined. A dear, pretty,
little good-natured thing, who required
some one stronger than herself to iuide

and direct her through the shoals of life.
A woman who was sweet and guileless as
an infant, a very child in nature, and whose
faults proceeded entirely from too kindly
and unworldly a disposition.

This was how he summed her up, after
half an hour's conversation and after
some fifty or sixty eye-glances, lip-pouts,
shoulder-shrugs, and hand-touches. It
takes quite an ordinary Delilah to defeat a
Sampson, and Lord Littelbrane was no
pillar of strength. The very seclusion in
which he had lived, his reluctance to mix
freely with the sex, rendered him all the
more credulous and unsuspicious. Taking
a wife was very much the same as taking
an awkward fence out hunting. He did
not like the necessity. It put him in an
awful fright ;* still, once it became patent
that the thing must be done, it was wiser
to go through with a good grace.

And now he found his courage rising.

She was so very sweet and gracious  nay,
almost caressing.

He cleared his throat, and, with a preparatory
cough, said :

Ahem ! Lady De Fochsey, I wish to
consult you on a delicate matter, but
before doing so will you grant me a
favour ? "

Why, most certainly" she answered,
surprised by the solemnity of his manner.

Thank you. I thought you would.
Will sou give me your views on matrimony
? "

On matrimony ! " she echoed, fairly
astonished at the demand.

*' Yes, I should like to hear your ideas,
if you have no objection to stating them."

Do you mean my own personal experiences,
Lord Littelbrane, or the opinions
that I have formed in a general way ? "

I should like both, but the former for
choice. What 1 want to arrive at is this :

Do you, or do you not, approve of marriage,
looking at it not emotionally, but merely asa
philosopher ? "

What a peculiar question. Of course
I hold with matrimony as an institution.
Women would fare even worse than they
do without it."

Have you fully considered the responsibilities
connected with the state ? "

To what responsibilities do you refer,
my lord ? "

At the present moment, chiefly to
those incurred by parents towards their
offspring."

Oh ! I don't pretend to have any
experience in such matters," she said
lightly. " You see I was lucky enough
to avoid bringing a tribe of children into
the world."

You never had any ? Not even one ? "

No, never, I am thankful to say."

'' Excuse me, Lady De Fochsey, but

were you not disappointed at failing to
perpetuate the family name ? "

She burst out laughing. This cross-examination
appeared to her so utterly
absurd, and it had not yet dawned upon
her what he was driving at.

Eeally, Lord Littelbrane," she said,
still striving to control her mirth, " I
did not consider the family name of so
much importance as all that, and it
would have driven Sir Jonathan simply
mad to have had a squalling baby in the
house."

Strange," he murmured, eyeing her
critically from top to toe. " Any one would
have said that you were formed by nature
to be the mother of a healthy and numerous
family."

She was not over and above pleased at
the turn the conversation was taking. She
told herself it was coarse  very coarse.
As a charming woman she had no objection

to being admired, but not as a people of
the world.

Does your ladyship enjoy good
health ? " he went on, not noticing her
displeasure, and still pursuing his own
train of reflections with a stolid perseverance
that was one of the chief attributes
of his character.

Yes, very, thank goodness. Tve never
been ill in my life. But why this sudden
interest ? "

Young, strong, handsome, and the
owner of an admirable constitution," he
exclaimed, as if speaking his thoughts
aloud. " Where can I find a more suitable
mate, or one more likely to furnish me
with an heir ? Age, looks, temper  everything;
is right."

Good gracious ! Lord Littelbrane.
What on earth are you talking about ? '*

The time has come for an explanation.,
Lady De Fochsey." And as he spoke, he
VOL. II. 29

rose from this seat and began pacing restlessly
up and down the room. " It is
important that I should marry and obtain
a successor, otherwise the family title and
estates pass into unknown hands."

What a misfortune," she exclaimed
with an irrepressible touch of satire.

Of all the ladies of my acquaintance,"
he went on boldly, warming to his subject
at last, " you are the one whom I consider
most fitted to assist in procuring the
desired result. I am a plain-spoken man and
like coming to the point at once. My age
is forty six, and I have twelve thousand a
year. Will you be Lady Littelbrane ?"

So saying he stopped short, and looked
hard at her ladyship with his small colourless
eyes.

For the second time that day she experienced
a genuine movement of surprise.
Lord Littelbrane's proposal, however flattering
it might be to her vanity, was totally

unexpected. He had not paved the way
for it in the least. Moreover, this brusque
style of courtship did not recommend itself
to her ideas. They  as we already know 
were high-flown and romantic.

Besides on this particular afternoon her
soul was still steeped in the vague and
exquisite rapture produced by the recent
seance. Mystic influences intoxicated it.
If he had appealed to the more lofty and
spiritual side of her nature, he might have
had a chance ; but there was something
revolting and grossly material in the notion
of being invited to marry a man for the
express purpose of furnishing him with a
son and heir. Added to this, she had no
natural love of children. The siizht of a
baby did not throw her into tender
rhapsodies. On the contrary, the little
ugly, puckered, red-faced things only
inspired her with aversion. All the
affection she had to spare was already

29*

concentrated upon her darling pugs. In
short, Lord Littelbrane's proposal could not
possibly have been couched in more infelicitous
terms. The very words " children
and parental responsibilities " made her
shiver. And then, he was so abominably
grave. His face would have reflected
credit upon an undertaker, and won him
golden opinions as a hired mourner at a
funeral. She dearly loved a man with a
little dash and " go " about him, even if he
did require keeping in his place every now
and ajiain. During the whole time of Mr.
Jarrett's visit she had never once felt dull.
But, on the other hand. Lord Littelbrane
was a wealthy nobleman, and occupied a
fie position. If she married him she
would be able to snub all those people who
had shown her the cold shoulder during
her widowhood. To do so would aflxrd
infinite satisfaction. No doubt he offered
many advantages from a worldly point of

view. Even spiritual exaltation could not
entirely shut her eyes to that fact. And
then she looked at him. Looked critically
and dispassionately at his little, undersized
figure ; his bloodless face, with its covering
of wizened-up skin ; his sandy hair, and
weak, watery eyes. He was very insignificant
; in fact, downright ugly'. The
sort of man she disliked. Nevertheless, one
short hour ago she might have taken him,
and put up with his personal appearance ;
but at the present moment her whole
being vibrated in response to the ecstatic
conviction that she was deeply, desperately
in love, and at last had fallen victim to the
long-sought and vainly-courted passion of
which she had read so much in novels, and
seen so little in real life.

Already she felt like a heroine of
romance. Bob's brown eyes and bright
glances had penetrated her impressionable
heart, and henceforth she told herself that

she could never, never wed any but a
medium in search of the eternal verities.

How rapturous and yet how lofty had
been the sensations conjured up by that
too brief seance. And now she was requested
to sacrifice all these grand, heroic
feelings  feelings which seemed to lift her
into an altogether purer atmosphere  in
order to bring a young Littelbrane into the
world.

Faugh ! The vulgarity and the gross
materialism of the proposition clashed withall
her finer instincts, and even rendered
her impervious to her own self-interest.
The excitation of her mood was such that
it repudiated the commonplace idea of
getting married and having children. She
rose from her seat, smoothed down the front
of her dress (a habit of hers), and said :

M} lord, you do me great honour ;
nevertheless I cannot become Lady Littel-braes'*


He was too utterly amazed to be offended.
Such a reply had never entered into his
calculations.

Why not ? " he asked incredulously.
Have you any reason for saying no ? "

A mischievous smile played round the
corners of her mouth.

Because it is just possible I might
disappoint your expectations."

He looked at her, much as he would
have looked at some thoroughbred mare.

1 am inclined to think not, Lady De
Fochsey."

Well, whether I should or whether
I shouldn't, I am afraid to run the risk."

There need be none as far as you are
concerned."

What ? " she exclaimed satirically.
Not when Napoleon the Great offers the
honour of an alliance ? Pshaw ! my lord
I know what men are too well to believe
you."

He was rather flattered at being
compared with so famous a man. He
smiled.

I do not think you quite realise what
you are refusing," he said with quiet
confidence.

She made no immediate reply. Indeed,
she began to think that, arrogant as they
sounded, there might be some truth in his
words. She had got a little nearer earth
again in the last few minutes, and the
extreme assurance of his manner impressed
her more than she cared to admit.

Perhaps not. It is just possible you
may be right there," she said uneasily.

" However," he continued, taking up his
hat and stick, " I shall not look upon your
decision as final. No doubt my proposal
has come upon you as a surprise. Think
it over. In a month's time I shall ask
you again to be my wife, and expect then
to receive a different answer."

And with this curious speech he departed,
feeling very much more intent on
gaining Lady De Fochsey's consent than
when he had first entered the house.

Opposition lent a zest to the pursuit
which had hitherto been wanting.

He was not in the least downcast, as
many men similarly situated might have
been. He possessed far too good an opinion
of himself to believe for one moment that
the lady of his choice was in earnest. His
mind could not realize any woman refusing
him seriously.

Being somewhat unprepared for so great
an act of condescension on his part, it was
quite natural that she should require a little
time to get accustomed to it. This was
how he construed her rejection of his
suit.

As for himself  well  he did not profess
to be a very ardent wooer. He was marrying
from principle, and from principle

alone. That was why, unlike the rest of
mankind, he could look round calmly, and
select a partner according to his theories of
selection and maternal aptitude. But
under these circumstances he was not in a
hurry. He felt none of the passionate
impetuosity of youth, and had no objection
to wait until her ladyship had become
thoroughly familiarized with the greatness
and importance of her mission in life.

Of her ultimate acquiescence, he entertained
no doubts whatever.

When Lord Littlebrane had gone. Lady
De Fochsey sat for a long while lost in
meditation. By this time her mood was no
lonfrer so exalted as it had been immediately
after Eobert Jarrett's departure. The
phantasies of her brain were growing
dimmer and vaguer.

Already an inward voice whispered
uneasily that she had done a foolish thing
in refusing Lord Littelbrane.

What has a woman of your age got todo
with love ? " the tormentor kept on
sa3dng. " Are you not past all that
folly ? "

The thought made her feel quite
hysterical. It was such a cruel, cruel
question to emanate from one's own secret
consciousness, that it set her off laughing
and crying by turns.

The pugs were disturbed in their
slumbers, and barked in melancholy
chorus.

Thank goodness ! to these dear, discreet
confidantes she could confess the tumultuous
passions that tore her heart in twain.
Throwing herself full length on the hearth-rug
she embraced them fervently, almost
as if they, too, had been mediums, and
cried aloud :

"Oh! Doodie, Oh! Snoodie, my sweet
darlings ! Pity your poor mistress, for she
is most dreadfully in love, and has actually

refused a coronet and twelve thousand a
year. My pretty ones, what do you say
to that ? "

Doodie and Snoodie curled their tails,
blinked their eyes, and licked their black
shiny lips as much as to say :

We think our ' poor mistress ' has
taken leave of her senses altogether ; but
it don't much matter to us, as long as she
will retain them sufficiently to keep up a
good fire. As for love  it's all nonsense.
Comfort's the thing to go in for. Food,
warmth, drink, then sentiment can be dispensed
with."

Unfortunately Lady De Fochsey was
unable to obtain a clear insist into the
sagacious minds of Doodie and Snoodie.
If she had, she might have seen that
materialism there reigned supreme. Xo
gracious spirit-forms of departed pugs
affected the serenity of the living.

But their mistress, as she lay with them

clasped in her arms, kept on wondering what
further delicious manifestations miht have
taken place if only Lord Littelbrane had
not appeared when he did.

Her mind was a disordered chaos, in
which worldly and spiritual lovers were
grotesquely jumbled up, now one, now the
other gaining a short-lived preponderance.
Still, she had had so many of the former
that on the whole she preferred the latter.
A. spiritual embrace was not only very
exciting, but also delightfully novel.
Exhausted sensation took a fresh lease of
life when brought into communion with
psychological converts. Spirit - wooing
was so refined, so-chaste, so exquisitely
chivalrous.

There was nothing the least prosaic
about it  not like Lord Littelbrane's love-making.
His mode of courtship had
been laconic and commonplace to a
decree.

THE divinity's MOTHER.

As Bob walked in the direction of home
his thoughts, curiously enough, did not
dwell much on the events that had taken
place during his visit to Lady De Fochsey.
They rebounded from her ladyship to Dot
Lankester. It was strange how all the
higher longings within him, instead of
responding to the advances of his spiritual
affinity, were attracted in an entirely
different direction. He was disgusted with
the part he had more or less been forced
to play, and felt as if he had behaved
traitorously towards his real love.

Four whole days had now elapsed since
he had seen her. He becfan to fear she

must be ill, and wondered, although the
hour was somewhat advanced, whether he
could not concoct some excuse for calling
at Doctor Lankester's house, and perhaps
obtaining a peep of his daughter.

Thus thinking, he quickened his stride,
and walked steadily on, until within about
half a mile of the village. Then, all of a
sudden, as he turned a sharp bend in the
road, he saw no less a person than the
doctor himself immediately ahead.

This was indeed a piece of good luck, for
even if he failed to catch a glimpse of Dot,
he was sure to hear some news of her, and
learn the reason why, in spite of all his
endeavours, they had not met.

He soon overtook his neighbour, who
was walking at a leisurely pace, like one
enjoying the Sabbath repose, and who expressed
his pleasure at their meeting.

How do you do, Mr. Jarrett ? " he said,
shaking hands cordially. " I see that, like

me, you have been tempted by the beauty
of the afternoon to take a constitutional'*
" Yes," replied Bob, " I thought a walk
would do me good ; but I confess to having
had an object. I have been calling on
Lady De Fochsey. Do you know her by
any chance ? "

No, we have never met, except in the
hunting field, where I have seen her occasionally,
but not often. She is not one of
our regular residents."

Oh ! indeed. And when do you hunt
again, doctor?" inquired Bob, thinking a
good opportunity had presented itself to
attack the subject of Dot's accepting a
mount.

I'm not quite sure. It's very difficult
for me to form plans beforehand. They
are so liable to be upset at the last
moment. But if I can possibly manage it
I hope to get out on Wednesday,"

"Let me see, where do they meet?"

said Bob. " My memory is so bad that I
Lave forgotten."

"At Pilkington Hill-side, in the very
best part of the whole country. That's
liv I'm anxious to keep the dav clear if I
can. We generally have a good run from
there. The Pilkington foxes are nearly
always a wild, straight-running lot."

And Doctor Lankester's mild face lit
up with the enthusiasm of a genuine
sportsman.

Does does Miss Lankester accompany
you ? " inquired Bob, a trifle confusedly.

I hope so. She has ]seen away from
home the last few days, staying with a
friend the other side of the county."

"Oh!" said Bob, trying to appear indifferent.
" I thought I had not seen her
about."

That was the reason ; but the child
comes back on Tuesday, and I should like
to arrange a treat for her if I could. You
VOL. II. 30

don't know what an awfully keen sportswoman
Dot is, Mr. Jarrett."

I can quite imagine it, if lie takes
after her father," said Bob with a
smile.

Well, I suppose these things are hereditary,"
admitted Doctor Lankester. " At
all events, Dot inherits her love of sport
from me, for her mother does not know a
horse from a cow. However, the child is a
true chip of the old block, and it is a
pleasure to see her out hunting. She
enjoys herself so thoroughly. The only
thing is it makes me wish I could afford
to mount her decently."

Doctor Lankester had altogether dropped
his professional manner, and apparently
enjoyed nothing better than talking about
his daughter, of whom he was evidently as
proud as he was fond.

Now was Bob's chance ; he could not
possibly have had a better.

I  I wanted to ask you something,"
he said, blusliiriG like a sclioolml.

Indeed ! What is it ? If I can be of
any assistance to you, I shall be only too
glad."

"It's a favour," said Bob, turning a
shade more crimson than before.

"I'm delighted to hear it, because, in
that case, the probabilities are the request
is something I am in a position to
grant."

Thank you, awfully, doctor ; I only
want you to say yes."

His companion smiled. Bob's simplicity
was a refreshing contrast to Captain
Straighten's hauteur.

You forget," he said indulgently, " that
I still remain in ignorance as to your
wishes."

'' Well, the fact is," Bob blurted out in
reply, " I have a great many more horses

in my stables than I can possibly ride "

30*

Then you're a very lucky man'' interrupted
the doctor playfully.

Yes, but if you would only allow Do 
I mean Miss Lankester, to take one whenever
she wants to go hunting, it would be
conferring a downright obligation upon me.
There, that's what I wanted to say."

Doctor Lankester crave no immediate
reply. Coming from an almost total
stranger he was touched by the kindliness
of the offer. In twenty years Captain
Straighten! had never made a similar one.

Well, what do you think of my idea ? "
asked Bob anxiously. " You won't refuse,
will you ? "

'''Upon my word, Mr. Jarrett, I hardly
know. It is awfully kind of you to
suggest such a thing, but I scarcely feel
justified in allowing Dot to profit by your
generosity."

It would be uncommonly nice to drive
her a real good mount for Wednesday''

urged Bob persuasively, " especially if lie
knew nothing at all about it till she f]fot to
the meet."

Dr. Lankester's countenance showed that
the proposition was one which recommended
itself.

He was devotedly attached to his
daughter, and the mere thought of iivirif]
her pleasure proved a great inducement to
accept Mr. Jarrett's offer.

I think Dot would go off her head with
delight," he said. " How she would ride if
she were really well mounted. I should
like you to see her follow hounds just for
once, Mr. Jarrett." And his face beamed
with paternal pride.

I hope to see Miss Lankester follow
hounds not once, but many times," Bob rejoined
; " and, as I said before, it will bean
act of charity to keep my horses in
work."

*' There are not many ladies in these

parts who can beat Dot across a country,"
went on the doctor, feeling that he had
secured a sympathetic listener, and in his
innocence never once suspecting Bob might
have an ulterior motive. ' Although I say
it  who shouldn't  she can ride. I know
no prettier sight in this world than to see
Dot coming over a fence."

She's a pretty sight anywhere," said
Bob, under his breath. Then he added
aloud, and in tones of perfect satisfaction,
Come, that's settled, and we need not
discuss the matter any more. How do ycu
go to covert, doctor ? "

We generally ride, provided the
distance is not too creation

that case, if you and Miss Lankester
will jog out to the meet on Wednesday,
Kingfisher shall be there in readiness, and
my groom can then change the saddles."

A thousand thanks. That will suit us
capitally, and I do hope, for Dot's sake, we

may have a good run, if only to give lier a
chance of proving herself not wholly unworthy
of your kindness."

Pray don't talk about kindness," said
Bob, colouring up to the roots of his hair.
The boot is on the other leaf, really."

Ah ? that's your nice way of putting
it."

Not at all. I can't tell you, doctor,"
and Bob's face grew suddenly grave, " how
lonely I am all by myself in that great big
house. I long for companionship, and if
you and your family would only treat meas
a friend, instead of as a stranger, you
would be conferring a real benefit."

Doctor Lankester was moved by this
appeal. He had conceived a great liking
for the simple and straightforward young
fellow, and only Bob's superior social position
had prevented him from showing it
more fully. Now his heart was completely
won.

We shall all appreciate having a neighbour
in you' he said heartily. " And if
we are to treat you unceremoniously, you
must treat us the same, and, whenever you
are dull or out of spirits, consider our house
your home. And, as a beginning, you had
better come in now and drink tea with my
wife, who will thoroughly enjoy a chat.
For here we are," pulling up before the
identical porch beneath which Bob had
stood gazing at Dot's pure profile only a
few nights previously

The young man gladly accepted this invitation.
He had nothing: whatever to do
until dinner-time ; and, in spite of Dot's
absence, his curiosity prompted him to take
the present opportunity of seeing her home
and surroundings. The" would surely
speak to him of her in some form or
other.

He also believed that if he could but
succeed in establishing a friendship between

himself and Doctor and Mrs. Lankester, it
would materially assist this cause hereafter.
There was nothing like having the parents
on one's side to start with. Their goodwill
might prove an enormous gain, and greatly
facilitate all future meetings.

Mothers were proverbially kind to eligible
young men who appeared to fancy their
daughters, and Bob entertained every hope
of enlisting Mrs. Lankester's sympathies. A
quiet half-hour's confidential conversation
would at least afford a chance of making a
favourable impression, which he should
take care to increase later on.

So he followed the doctor into a small
but cheerful and cleanly-papered passage,
and shortly afterwards was ushered into the
presence of Dot's mother. He had looked
upon her with reverence, as a being to be
admired and distantly adored, in virtue of
her quite too charming daughter. And she
disappointed him.

Had lie not been so young and so foolish
he might have known that such would
surely prove the case. For when does a
middle-aged woman ever come up to a
man's expectations ? He can always find a
flaw in her somewhere, if so disposed. His
imagination had pictured a gentle, fragile,
ethereal-looking old lady, with silvery locks,
and a white Shetland shawl, and a sweet
musical voice. In reality, he saw a stout,
roundly-shaped personage, with black
beady eyes, rosy cheeks, and several chins,
who spoke in a sharp staccato voice, and
who, against his will, impressed him with
an idea of vulgarity, and of belonging to a
lower class than did her husband.

Mrs. Lankester was clad in a black silk
dress, very shiny at the shoulder-blades.
Her head was covered by a gorgeous
erection of lace and bright blue ribbons,
and round her fat red neck liuniif a honos o;old
watch-chain. The first glimpse proclaimed

her fondness for meretricious adornment.
At least, so Bob decided. As for any resemblance
to Dot  well, when she began to
speak, it relieved him to find that there was
none. They had not a single trait or
feature in common. All the girl's refinement
and gentility evidently came from her
father. She owed none of her charms to
the maternal side.

Mrs. Lankester received him most
graciously ; nevertheless, there was something
about her which he did not like,
though he would have been at a loss to
define what that something was. Her exaggerated
civility produced an irritating
effect upon his nerves, and seemed too
great to be real. There was too much
fussiness in her manner and in her effusive
speeches. He preferred Doctor Lankester's
homely method of offering hospitality. But
that good man remained singularly quiet in
the presence of his better half, of whom it

was easy to see he stood in considerable
awe. He soon left the room, pleading as
an excuse that he had some business to
attend to, and the lady was not ill-pleased
to find herself alone with her guest. The
doctor always would prose on so about
medicine and science, and things that
nobody cared a bit about. She should
extract far more from ]\[r. Jarrett in his
absence.

Meanwhile the tea had been brought up,
and she pretended to be very busy among
the cups and saucers.

Sugar ? " she inquired presently, with
an ingratiating smile, holding up a lump
between the tongs, and thrusting it almost
under her visitor's nose.

If you please, Mrs. Lankester."

And cream ? " laying an emphasis
on the words, which called attention to
the fact of cream and not milk being
offered.

' If it is not troubling you too much,"
said Bob amiably.

Oh ! don't mention the trouble ; it's a
pleasure."

Seated vis-a-vis his hostess and furnished
with a cup of boiling tea, which could only
be drunk in spasmodic sips, and which was
far more painful to the palate than comforting,
Bob now, for the first time, summoned
up sufficient courage to inquire after Dot.

And so your daughter is away from
home, Mrs. Lankester ? " he said.

Yes, she left early on Wednesday
morning. In fact, the day after she and
her father dined with you."

Don't you miss her most dreadfully ?
I'm sure I should if I had such a child,"
said Bob, his imagination running riot.

"Oh! yes, of course," responded Mrs.
Lankester, in tones which gave the lie
direct to the assertion.

But then, you see, Mr. Jarrett, we poor

mothers of families have got to get used to
losing our offspring."

Do you mean that they take husbands
unto themselves ? "

Exactly. You've hit the right nail on
the head."

And is Miss Dot (Tfoing: to set married ? "
he asked with considerable perturbation.

"Now, now, how you do jump at conclusions,
to be sure ! I never implied such
a thing ; I merely meant to say that I
suppose she will some day, when the right
man turns up."

And hasn't he turned up yet ? "

*' Not in my opinion. Bits of boys without
a halfpenny to bless themselves with
are no good whatever, and the mistake is
encouraging them, as I have impressed upon
Dot since her childhood."

MATERNAL TROUBLES.

Bob gave a sigh of relief at this announcement.
He felt as if some deadly weight
had been removed from his heart.

She's sure to marry pretty soon," lie
said decidedly.

She may or she may not," answered
Mrs. Lankester, looking at him with her
sharp black eyes. " I don't mind telling you
that my eldest daughter made a very bad
match indeed, thanks to her father's weakness
in giving his consent ; and I've no
intention of allowing Dot to do the same,
that is to say  " drawing herself up consequentially,
" if / have any voice in the
matter."

Quite right," said Bob, highly approving

of this decision, since he saw that it shut
the doors to numbers of penniless candidates.


You see, Mr. Jarrett," continued Mrs.
Lankester in her most confidential manner,
poor Matilda was simply sacrificed. Befell
in love with a young engineer who had
only a hundred and fifty a year, and Doctor
Lankester, instead of sending him to the
right about, actually encouraged the
marriage. With what result ? There js
poor dear Matilda now, at five-and-twenty,
living in some frightful, unhealthy African
village, from which she may never live to
return, and wdtli three little bits of
children on her hands. Can you conceive
of anything more dreadful or more trying
to my maternal feelings ? "

But perhaps she is happy, Mrs. Lankester.
If so she would make liixht of
enduring a few hardships for the sake of
being with her husband."

Oil ! don't talk to me of lier husband.
Every time I hear his name mentioned it
makes me mad to think what a fool Doctor
Lankester was, not to send him off with a
flea in his ear. But I shall take pretty-good
care not to let Dot throw herself away
in a similar manner, however much she
may be backed up by her father."

And as she spoke Mrs. Lankester s
countenance assumed such an obstinate
expression that Bob immediately caught
himself pitying her more unworldly and
tender-hearted spouse, and wondering how
many Caudle lectures he had already
been treated to on the subject of Matilda's
mesalliance. But he kept his speculations
secret, and said soothingly :

I think you have no cause for alarm

as regards Miss Lankester. She is sure to

make a good marriage, possibly a brilliant

one. But perhaps you are too ambitious."

Oh ! dear no, Mr. Jarrett. You are

VOL. n. 31

(quite mistaken there. I would let her
jnaiTj anybody who had a sufficient
income,"

*' And what do you call a sufficient
income, Mrs. Lankester ? Fifteen thousand
a year ? "

That was precisely the amount he had
inherited from his uncle.

Two would satisfy me. But there  "
breaking off short, " what's the use of
talking . Young men with money and on
the look out for a wife are scarce in this
part of the world : and even a few hundreds
are not to be picked up in a hurry."

I thought there were any number of
hunting bachelors in Stiflshire," said
Job.

So there are. But they don't count,
though lots of them are aggravating
rich."

"Indeed! Why not?"

Because their heads are stifled full of

nothing but horses and hounds, and they
think far more of a yearling filly than they
do of a young lady. I begin to despair of
Dot's finding a husband down here." And
Mrs. Lankester sighed audibly.

She must have one, of course P " said
Bob, with a touch of satire lost upon his
listener, whose extreme worldliness repelled
him, although he could not help feeling
amused by it.

' Of course. What is a young woman
to do if she remains single ? She's a
perfect nobody, and has no position whatever.
Besides, Dr. Lankester can't afford
to leave either of his daughters a fortune,
He's not at all a rich man, and of late years
he has been far from strong."

"Never fear," said Bob confidently.
*miss Dot can do quite well without a
dot '  no joke intended."

Ah ! that's all very fine, but seriously,
Mr. Jarrett, what disturbs me so much

31*

now-a-days is the tribe of women one
meets with wherever one goes. There
are a great many more in existence than
there are men, and things have got to such
a pass in our country, that the fact of the
matter is there are not enough husbands to
ago round. Some of the girls are bound to
get left out in the cold, whether they like
it or not."

Then I should ship them off to
Australia," said Bob, laughing heartily.
A batch of nice, rosy English young
ladies would be immensely appreciated out
in the bush."

One can't send a girl off to a foreign
country all alone," said Mrs. Lankester,
receiving the suggestion quite seriously

Besides, Dot is so young set, that I think
she should be allowed to have a chance first,
though Heaven only knows how she is ever
to meet anybody worth marrying down
here."

((

Mrs. Lankester's anxiety to get rid of lier
daughter, and the way in which she
appealed to him, tickled Bob's fancy not a
little. A lady of greater refinement would
have concealed her object better, and
treated the whole matter more artistically.
Instinct told him that in his love's mother
he should find a powerful ally, who would
advance his cause by every means at her
disposaL And, though he might not
much like the woman, this was of vast
importance. It was an immense relief, too,
to ascertain that practically the field lay
open, and that none other had laid siege to
Dot's affections.

Consequently, the more piteously Mrs.
Lankester bewailed this scarcity of eligible
suitors, the lighter hearted he grew.
Everything appeared satisfactory, as far
as he was concerned.

"You mark my words," he said gaily,
*' some stranger will come pouncing down

on Miss Dot when you least expect it, and
carry lier ofF before you have time to
recover from your surprise."

' I hope so at any rate. But are you
really in earnest, Mr. Jarrett?" looking at
him with eyes which seemed to pierce his
innermost thoughts.

Yes, quite. Your daughter is much
too charming to remain a spinster, even
in this country, where there is such a
sad insufficiency' of the masculine creature."


"And you are not joking?" she said
pointedly. " You really mean what you
say ?

Of course I do ; I never was more
serious in my life."

Why, Mr. Jarrett," she exclaimed play-full
v, " I shall befiin to think you are a
little bit ' gone ' on Dot yourself." And an
unctuous smile spread slowly over all her
roseate countenance.

It was a hazardous speech, but there was
a look in his face which emboldened her
to make it, and made her heart beat fast
with a hope that surpassed even her highest
ambition.

He blushed furiously, but did not attempt
to deny the insinuation.

Suddenly she leant forward and said with
almost motherly solicitude :

I hope we shall see you very often,
Mr. Jarrett, although we have no fine
house, or good cook, or old wines to offer
as an inducement."

"I don't care two straws about such
things," he said hastily.

No ? Well, then, I shall no longer
feel afraid to make you heartily welcome
whenever you like to come. Even a potluck
dinner we could manage, if you are
not particular."

There never was anyone less so. You
seem to forget, Mrs. Lankester, that I was

not born in the purple, and have only
lately inherited my fortune."

It's a relief to find you have not inherited
Captain Straighten's manners as
well as his moneys*' said the lady vindictively.
" I can't abide those stuck-up,
supercilious people."

I hope you don't thir-k me ' stuck-up
'? " said Bob.

"Xot a bit. That's why I like you."

I am glad jour first impressions have
been favourable, Mrs. Lankester."

La ! Mr. Jarrett, I feel as if we were
quite intimate already, and can almost
imagine I had known 3'ou all my life. I
should no more have dreamt of telling sour
uncle about Matilda's marriage, and m}'
hopes for Dot, than of flying. But you are
what I call a real neighbour, not a make-believe."


I hope to prove in3'self one," he said.

You have done that already ; but if

you wish to do so still more, you might
take compassion on that poor girl of mine,
every now and again when you have no
better employment. She leads a dull life
at best, and a little young society would
do her all the good in the world."

He understood perfectly what she intended
to convey by this petition. Her
vulgarity was intense, but fortunately her
wishes coincided with his own, so that he
felt no difficulty in complying with the

request.

.

Only he could not help thinking that it
was very disgusting of a woman to throw
her daughter at a man's head quite so
plainly, simply because she knew he was
well-off. For of his real character Mrs.
Lankester could know positively nothing.
She might have been sacrificing her
offspring at the shrine of a monster, for
aught she was aware.

Had lib been in Dot's place he should

have resented such conduct fiercely, and
he fancied now that he could divine the
reason of her coldness and reserve. No
doubt the mother's many lectures on
matrimony had revolted her pride, and
caused her to assume that sternly defensive
demeanour which in his heart of hearts he
both admired and respected.

He told himself that he should not have
liked her so well if, instead of exhibiting
the same simple, child-like nature as her
father, she had taken after Mrs. Lankester.

That lady inspired him with an antipathy
which he was at a loss wholly to account
for. Her amiability struck him as unreal,
her 2[ood humour as forced.

But he was extremely ungrateful to
harbour such thoughts, whilst she sat
there, smiling at him across the table and
confiding' all her maternal troubles, as if
he had been her bosom friend and on terms
of the greatest intimacy.

When at length he arose to take his
leave, he was conscious that she had
somehow contrived to establish a kind of
secret understanding, the purport of which
was much to this effect :

You admire my daughter ; you can't
hide that fact from me, tr} what you will.
Very well Don't be afraid. The cirl has
arrived at a marriageable age, and it is
high time she was settled in a home of her
own, and off my hands. You can make upto
her as much as ever you like. I shall
take care that you have every opportunity
given you."

Bob naturally enough was delighted with
his visit, though not perhaps equally so
with his future mamma-inlaw He foresaw
that the probabilities were he should like
her better before than after matrimony,
and caught himself wonder in 2f how she
might be prevented from paying too
frequent visits at the Court.

No sooner had he left the room than
Mrs. Lankester popped her head out of
the door and called in a sharp excited
voice :

Dr. Lankester. Come here, I want
you ! "

Yes, Emma, what is it ? " he enquired,
emerging from his laboratory in shirt sleeves
and slippers.

That 3oung man is in love with Dot.
You mark my words."

"What young man?" he enquired
mildly, having forgotten the very existence
of his late visitor.

"What young man ? Why! Mr. Jarrett
of course, and I tell you he's awfully
spooney already."

Nonsense, Emma. You women are
always taking ridiculous ideas into your
heads."

Oh ! indeed ! / take ridiculous ideas
into my head, do I . I, who am the only

one who lias a grain of sense in this house.
Thank you, Doctor Lankester, thank

you."

Pshaw ! " he muttered impatiently,
threatening to withdraw. " Can't a poor
young fellow even set foot inside our doors
without your having designs upon him ? "
And he commenced a retreat.

Don't go. I've something to say to
sou," his better-half exclaimed authoritatively.


'you generally have, my dear," he
responded with a sigh of resignation.

Yes, but this is something very special
something that may affect your
daughter's future welfare, and secure her
fortunes hereafter.

Out with it, then. Every woman
should make a point of checking all
tendency towards verbosity. The sex have
a natural inclination to use half-a-dozen
words where one would do."

"How rude you are! But about Mr.
Jarrett "

Well, what of him ? Has he been
doing or saying anything very startling ? "

You know what a terrible muddle you

made in poor Matilda's case " unheeding

the demand.

That's according to one's individual
way of thinking. Matilda may not be rich,
but she's very happy, and money is not
everything in this world."

It's a great deal, though. And
supposing Matilda's husband were to die
tomorrow, where would she be ? Should
not you have to keep her and the three
children ? " looking at him contemptuously.


This interrogation was so unanswerable
that Doctor Lankester took refuse in
silence. He generally said as little as
possible when the partner of his bosom
bean an argument, knowing from bitter

experience that otherwise it was apt to
prove interminable.

"All I want is this," continued Mrs.
Lankester. "You've had your own way
with one daughter, and failed signally, let
me have mine with Dot."

I don't understand you. And God
knows I don't want to have my own way
in anything that is not for the child's
good."

You are very dense. Leave me to
manage Mr. Jarrett, and don't attempt to
interfere."

But, Emma "

No, let us have no buts. You are not
called upon to volunteer confessions, even
if there were any to make. All I ask you
to do is to hold your tongue."

I fear there may be some deception,"
he said, yielding a reluctant consent.

*' Deception, indeed ! And pray what
do you take me for. Doctor Lankester?

That is a pretty word for a man to use to
his own wife. It's as good as telling her
that she's a downright liar."

Emma, I do wish you would not use
that word. It's unladylike in the extreme."


Story-teller, then, though it's too
absurd to be so particular, when you
have just told me to my face that I am
capable of playing all sorts of mean
tricks "

I'm sure I never said anything of the
sort," said the poor doctor apologetically.

You insinuated it, John. Yes, and in
the most unkind and brutal fashion. And
all because I asked you to maintain a discreet
reserve where your own daughter is
concerned. It really does not signify tome
who Dot marries, not a bit ; but don't
lay the blame at my door if she ends by j

being a pauper, and has not even so much I

as a roof over her head after your death."

And SO saying Mrs. Lankester flounced
out of the room, leaving her husband in a
state of mild bewilderment as to what the
discussion*really meant, and for what particular
reason he was sternly forbidden to
allude to certain innocent facts in Mr.
Jarrett's presence.

VOL II.



CHAPTER XIII.

THE Morley Instead MEET IN TIIEIll Chace

COUNTRY.

A LARGE and fashionable host assembled at
Pilkincfton Hill-side to street the Morbev
Anstead hounds in their crack country.
Every town and village within a radius of
twenty miles had apparently poured forth
its contingent. Many arrived by train, but
more reached the fixture on smart, galloping
hacks, whose fore-legs seemed warranted o
resist the trying influences of Macadam.
About quarter of a mile from the covert
was a road where each fresh arrival congregated,
and this road was literally
crowded with horsemen, grooms, spectators
and vehicles of every description, from a
.smart four-in-hand containing a batch of

officers from the neii?libouriniT town of
Stiffton, to a diminutive, yellow-painted
donkey cart, the owners of which were
standing up on the wheels in order to
obtain a more elevated point of view.

Huntsmen and hounds were evidently
the chief attraction to the natives. Burnett
was surrounded by a bevy of meanly clad,
good-natured foot-people, who watched his
proceedings, and those of his canine tribe
with interest interest, and uttered remarks
amusing from the very ignorance they
displayed. Altogether the scene was a
brilliant one, rendered gay to the eye by
the numbers of scarlet coats and snowy
leathers, which offered a pleasing contrast
to their back-ground of grey-green grass
and neutral-coloured hedge-rows, that
stretched far away towards the horizon.
A few gleams of sunshine would have
rendered it still more imposing, and given
warmth to the surrounding landscape ; but

32*

the day was dull and still, with a quiet
grey sky, and just a bite of frost in the
air.

What wind there was came from the
east. Though not stroma it was cold in
quality, and made the horses round their
backs and whisk their tails in a manner not
wholly agreeable to nervous riders. The
Field were in a particularly cheerful and
sanguine mood. Even the Mutual 
were a shade less sad than usual,
and not quite so chary of speech. By a
remarkable coincidence, everybody had
apparently made up his or her mind that
the day was one destined to prove productive
of a good run. Even Burnett seemed
hopeful, and declared there was every
appearance of its being a scenting morning,
which statement still further increased the
expectations of his followers.

Bob had taken care to arrive early. He
sported " pink " for the first time, and felt

very fine in his new clothes. Already he
wondered at himself for ever having
descended to elastic straps. Looking back,
even Charles' ill-concealed derision appeared
perfectly justifiable. His thoughts, however,
Averse full of Dot, and he was glad not
to differ from his neighbours for her sake.
He would not have liked her to consider
him a guy. He left home quite a quarter
of an hour sooner than was necessary,
because he did not desire to miss the
pleasure of seeing her face when first she
became aware of the fact that she was to
ride Kingfisher instead of Mouse.

Consequently, he took up his station at
the junction of four roads a little way
removed from the crowd, whilst his pulses
throbbed with feverish expectation. Meantime
Kingfisher was safely domiciled in
some farm buildings close at hand.

Fortunately for the impatient young
man he had not to wait lonir.

Before many minutes had gone by, he
recognised a certain sturdy dun cob,
advancing at a brisk trot, and bearing on
her back a slender, feminine figure which
set this heart a-beating even whilst yet a
considerable distance off.

Doctor Lankester accompanied his
daughter. He was mounted on a short-legged,
compact, flea-bitten grey mare, with
a big body, strong quarters, and a lean
head and neck, which gave her a real
business-like and " varmint " appearance.
In fact she looked a hunter all over ; and
the way she pricked her ears at sight of
the hounds, champed at her bit, and
quickened her stride, proclaimed a decided
preference for chasing the fox rather than
jogging soberly along the roads from one
patient to another. Her rider appeared
transformed. From a quiet, rather melancholy
individual, he had changed into a
vivacious and enthusiastic sportsman, who

sat his horse like a centaur, and whose
heart was evidently in the work.

' Hooray ! Here you are ! " exclaimed
Bob, colouring with pleasure, and raising
his hat to Dot. "How do you do, Miss
Lankester ? Has your father been telling
you as you came along of the terrible plans
we have hatched in your absence ? "

The tone of his voice reassured her.

No," she said smiling. " What plans ? "

The fresh air and the sharp exercise had
tinted her face like a wild rose.

I will leave Doctor Lankester to
explain ; for if you don't approve of our
conspiracy, you will forgive him more
readily than me."

She turned towards her father with a
look of bewilderment in her clear eyes.

Papa," she said. " What does Mr.
Jarrett mean ? "

Well, Dot," he replied, " the fact is,
our kind friend and neighbour has insisted

upon your accepting a mount for the day.
So jump off old Mouse, my girl, and we
will set about changing saddles at once."

A sudden flush of pleasure rushed to her
cheeks, and dyed them a vivid crimson.
Bob would not have lost the sicht of that
involuntary expression of delight for a great
deal. It sent an answering thrill of rapture
running through his veins, and was all the
reward he wanted. No words could have
conveyed ]half so much.

And Dot, taken completely by surprise,
did not give herself time to think. Besides,
if her father had sanctioned the proceedings,
it was absurd for her to entertain any
scruples. Need letter days were scarce.
Surely she would be a fool not to profit by
one when she i>ot the chance.

Some such thoughts flashed for a moment
through her brain, and she exclaimed
cordially :

A mount for me ? Oh ! Mr. Jarrett,

how good of you. I feel as if it were
impossible to thank you enough.'

But Bob had vanished. Without waiting
to hear what Dot would say he had gone
off in search of Kingfisher. He reappeared
however, very shortly, accompanied by a
groom leading the proud animal destined
to carry Miss Lankester.

She jumped lightly to the ground without
further delay, and stood holding Mouse's
bridle with her small, gloved hands, whilst
her saddle was being transferred from the
one horse to the other.

A little, slender bit of a thing she looked ;
not exactly short, but very slight and
girlish, and with a wonderful pair of clear,
intelligent eyes, through which her whole
nature seemed to shine.

So Bob thought as he gazed at her, but
Dot's attention was fully engrossed by
Kingfisher.

The chestnut was a real beauty, and a

thorough gentleman in appearance  long,
low, and symmetrical, with a blood-like
head, small sensitive ears, and a neck
strong, yet pliant as a piece of whalebone.
He stood about fifteen-three, on good sound
limbs, short from the knee downwards,
whilst his sloping shoulders denoted speed
and comfort to the rider, his great, long
muscular thighs and well let down hocks,
immense jumping capability. Dot was quite
sufficiently well versed in horse-flesh to take
in her hunter's good points. As for Doctor
Lankester, who like all Yorkshire men was
a heaven-born judge, he stood and looked
him over with the eye of a " connoisseur,"
and even then found it hard to detect a
fault.

That's something like a hunter," he
exclaimed approvingly. " Clean bred, yet
up to weight, and as nearly perfect in
shape, as man could wish for. Dot," turning
to his daughter with a pleased expression,

" it will be your fault, my girl, if you
do not slow a good many of us the way
to-day."

Dot gave a little, silvery laugh, wliicli
rang out musically on the still air.

I'll do my best at any rate, father. But
it takes a very first-rate performer to
flourish his heels in Sugarloaf's face."

Aye, aye, that's so," said the doctor,
playing with his mare's fine mouth. " But
all the same, if I'm not very much mistaken,
you'll have the legs of me to-day."

When all was in readiness, Bob, after
first apologizing for his inexperience, offered
to mount the girl, but her father's hands
were already clasped, and she put her foot
inside them with the confidence of long use.
In another second she was firmly seated in
the saddle, and gently taking up the reins,
leant forwards and patted Kingfisher's
glossy neck.

Nice old man," she said in cooing

accents. " You and I must soon make
friends."

As she moved ofT towards where the
hounds were located, her slight figure, with
its shapely shoulders and small, round waist
sitting firm and erect, although it yielded
gracefully to every movement of her horse,
Bob thought, that in spite of the patched
habit, and its threadbare seams, which again
had attracted his notice, he had never seen
a much prettier sight in his life. She was
so trim and neat, and her sweet little face
peeped out from under the brim of her pot
hat like some bright, fresh, wholesome
flower, that held its head up straight, and
knew none of the sin and misery that goes
on in this vale of tears.
He gave a few final directions to his
groom about taking Mouse back to her own
stables, and was just about to follow Doctor
Lankester and his daughter, when a voice
close behind said unceremoniously :

Halloa ! Bob. How are you ? "

Startled by the familiarity of the greeting,
he looked round and perceived Lady De
Fochsey, who in her scarlet coat and white
waistcoat, reminded him somewhat of a
monkey on a barrel-organ.

Good-morning," he responded politely,
trying to smother a slight feeling of annoyance
at her presence, and the off-hand
mode of address, which distinctly intimated
that she looked upon him as her
own peculiar property. '' Nice day this
for hunting."

Yes, very, though I shouldn't wonder
if it rained later on. By the way, would
you mind piloting me? I always like
knowing I have some one to rely upon, and
really. Captain Princeton has taken to
jumping such tremendous places, that I told
him only the last time he was out, it was
really impossible for me to follow him any
longer."

This request placed Bob in a dilemma.
He had never bargained for having to take
charge of her ladyship in the field, and was
rather alarmed by the proposition. To
begin with, he had not the very faintest
notion whether she went well to hounds or
not ; and moreover, on this particular day,
he had promised himself the pleasure of
keeping near Dot Lankester, and of seeing
how Kingfisher carried his precious burden.
Instinct told him, that if he acceded to
his spiritual affinity's demand, it would
seriously interfere with this programme.
She was not a lady to brook any rival.

Upon my word," he answered diplomatically,
" I should be only too glad to
assist you in any difficulty, but I am not
an experienced sportsman, and really don't
pretend to know enough about hunting to
undertake the delicate task of piloting a
lady across country."

Oh ! never mind that. Bob, you're too

modest by half. Besides, there's no occasion
to go so desperately hard. Indeed I'd
rather not as far as I am concerned.
These tremendous big fences only scratch
your face, and pull all your clothes to
pieces."

It don't much signify about my face
being scratched," he rejoined ungraciously,
though of course a lady's is different.
Only if hounds run, one is bound to try
and be with theme"'

Oh ! if one turns up at the checks it
does just as well. For my part, I prefer
sticking to the roads  they give you so
much better opportunities."

He made a wry face, but had not courage
enough to ask, to what sort of opportunities
she referred, though in his own
mind he summed them up by a single
word  flirtation.

"I give you fair warning," he said,
striving to conceal his impatience at being

separated from Dot, " that I am not a fit
person to pilot a lady."

"But, Bob  I want to talk to you. I
must talk to you, in fact."

What about, Lady De Fochsey ? Can't
you say what you've got to say now ? "

Impossible ! How can you ask such a
question, especially after all that happened
the other day ? Is there no more magnetic
sympathy between us? Has it entirely
evaporated ? "

I'm sure I don't know," he responded
sheepishly. " I never exactly understood
what magnetic sympathy meant."

"You seemed to have a pretty good
inkling of it last Sunday afternoon at any
rate, but it appears to me that you have
retrogression since then."

"Yes, I am afraid I have. I am not
conscious of much improvement."

Have you made no progress whatever,
Bob ? "

"It seems not. At least according to
your way of thinking."

Alas ! Neither have I, and it proves tome
conclusively, that the latent possibilities
within us cannot be developed singly,
but require mutual assistance. We must
repeat our experiments, and lose no time
in doing so, else what powers we already
possess will fade away, owing to the
weakening: of the electric current. Tell
me, Bob," sidling up close to him, " when
may I expect you ! I shall take care this
time, that our seance is not interrupted, just
when we are obtaining important results."

He felt more and more embarrassed.
Her eagerness was difficult to deal with.

Eeally," he said, in shuffling tones that
were most unusual to him, and wishing to
goodness he had the moral courage to put
an end to this tomfoolery once and for all,
"it's almost impossible to Qx any exact
time."

VOL. IT. 33

Are you so very, very busy ? " she
asked sarcastically.

He reddened. The tone of her voice
brought home an uncomfortable sense of
evasion.

"Well, yes, I am. The fact is, Lady
De Fochsey," setting his jaw as if he were
going at some impenetrable bull-fmch, " I
can't cultivate my ' latent possibilities '
until my terrestrial affairs have been placed
in some order."

But why not combine the two ?
The development of your psychic force
would enable you to attend to mere
mundane business* with far greater
ability."

I fear that it cannot be done. I am
not so sanguine as you."

She turned a pair of reproachful blue
eyes full upon him.

Oh, Bob," dropping her voice almost
to a whisper, " you are dreadfully unkind.

I could not have believed that you would
have treated me like this."

Like what ? " The rose, whose fragrance
he had not been strong enough to
withstand, was beginning to show thorns.

You seem to ignore my sufferings
altogether."

"We will hope that they are not very
terrible," he said, tr34ng to banter her out
of her sentimental mood.

But they are ; and oh ! Bob, we should
not have needed many more seances. Half-a-dozen
or so would soon have rendered us
independent of hand-joining. It is only
the preliminary stages that are perhaps a
little tedious, and when people are born
mediums like yourself, they have certain
obligations towards their fellow-creatures
which it is downright wicked to ignore."

And she looked at him fearfully, for she
had not foreseen this refractory spirit.

The distressed expression of her countenance

produced the intended effect. Bob
relented somewhat.

Well, well," he said temporising,
there's time enough yet. We will wait
till a frost comes, and then see what can be
done in the way of spiritual and magnetic
improvement."

She was going to make some reply, but
at this precise moment, Lord Littelbrane,
not seeing Bob, rode up to her side, and the
young man profited by the opportunity to
effect an immediate escape. He at once
cantered off' in pursuit of the Ancestors,
who had joined the hounds.

Two minutes afterwards his lordship gave
the signal for the proceedings of the day to
commence, and, accompanied by a whole
crowd of foot-people, Burnett moved off* at
the head of a huge procession, and trotted
briskly across half-a-dozen grass fields
which separated the covert from the road.

Kingfisher had not been out Imntincf

since his late accident, and consequently
was very fresh. When the good horse saw
his old friends, the little beautiful, white
and tan ladies in front of him, and felt the
soft, elastic turf under his hoofs, he
whinnied with delight, and in the exuberance
of his spirits, bounded high into the
air.

You are not frightened, are you ? "
said Bob, a little anxiously to Dot
Lankester.

Her whole face was aglow with pleasure.


"Frightened? Oh! dear no. I like it.
You've no idea, Mr. Jarrett, what an
exhilarating sensation it is to feel a good
hunter under one when you've only been
accustomed to inferior animals. I don't
think I ever was on such a horse," caressing
Kingfisher's silky mane, an action
which provoked another playful buck, and
a little ringing laugh from Dot.

I never thought he'd play the fool like
this," said Bob resentfully.

He's only light-hearted, Mr. Jarrett,
and so am I," she called out gaily in reply.

Seeing her so cool and undisturbed both
in seat and in nerve, Bob began to feel
reassured, especially as Doctor Lankester
made as licht of Kingfisher's vagaries as
did his daughter, and evidently entertained
no fears on her behalf.

So Bob concluded that his alarm was
groundless. Nevertheless he stuck to Dot's
side until the covert was reached and a
general halt proclaimed. Having mounted
the girl he persuaded himself easily enough
into the belief that it was more or less his
duty to look after her.

CHAPTEE I.

A REGULAR " CLINKER.

An expectant silence fell upon the hard-riding
division of the field, whilst hounds
were drawing the celebrated covert, known
by the name of Pilkington Hill-side.
Every sound made these eager Nimrodss
prick up their ears, and the shrill whistle
of a distant train, striking suddenly on
the air, was momentarily mistaken for a
view halloa, and created quite a remarkable
commotion, though one of short-lived
duration.

Whilst less enthusiastic sportsmen stood

VOL. II". 34

lighting up cigars and whiling away the
time in desultory conversation, the more
ardent spirits threaded their way dexterously
through the crowd of horses, and
stationed themselves opposite a five-barred
gate, at a point where they considered the
fox was most likely to break covert.
They stood there like sentinels, ready,
however, to dart off in pursuit directly
Pug made an attempt to face the open.
Scarce a sound did they utter, except an
occasional oath, when some fidgety animal
sidled or kicked, and so caused his rider to
fall back and lose a place or two, besides
provoking a general feeling of irritation.

But the minutes went by, and Reynard
did not show himself, as was confidently
anticipated, Not even a whimper burst
from the throats of his enemies, and
nought could be heard, save the steady
crashing of twigs and grasses, as the
hounds poked about among the thick

undergrowth and thoroughly investigated
every likely spot. Now and again, one
would steal out into the field, and there
pause to take breath, before recommencing
her labours. By-and-by others might be
seen gazing disconsolately around, as if to
give notice that they were quite as much
disappointed as their human friends and
allies at the way events were shaping.

Consternation now began to spread
amongst the ranks. Jaws dropped, faces
looked glum. Pilkington Hill side blank ?
and blank thus early in the season.
What could the owner have been about,
or what excuses had he to make for so
disgraceful a state of things ? He was too
fond of shooting by a great deal. He was
not half a sportsman. He ought to have
cut down some of the undergrowth. It
was ridiculously thick. The best hounds
in the world might not succeed in finding
a fox under such conditions, &c., &c. We

all know the sort of things that are said on
these occasions. There must be a scapegoat,
and he is nearly always the proprietor,
who, poor man ! nine times out of ten,
feels the non-discovery of Pug far more
keenly than the whole field put together,
and needs not their reproaches to inflict a
still deeper wound on his already lacerated
feelings. Presently a rumour circulated
to the effect that a tribe of starlings had
visited the covert at the close of the last
hunting season, and foxes in consequence
had refused to make a home of Pilkington
Hill-side, though the owner had done his
best to encourage their presence.

Even then, until the very last moment,
no one would believe that Pilkington
actually held no specimen of the vulpine
race. But when a quarter of an hour had
elapsed, melancholy confirmation was
given of the fact. Burnett blew his horn,
and slowly, at his summons, the reluctant

hounds crept out and came clustering
around him with wistful yellow eyes, which
seemed to say : " Don't be angry with us.
It was not our fault. We did our best to
find him, but he was not there."

A short consultation now took place
between huntsmen and master. The almost
unprecedented event of Pilkington not furnishing
the desired article had upset their
calculations. Although the chance of a
find was believed to be slight, it was now
determined to call upon a long, narrow
osier bed, lying close b}, at the foot
of the hill on which the company were
assembled. So the field moved on, with
hopes somewhat dashed by their nonsuccess,
and by the almost certain prospect
of a long jog to the next covert. Whose
was the blame, they knew not, but they
felt injured and aggrieved. Hounds were
perhaps more reasonable than bipeds. At
all events they did not despond, and

were soon at work, drawing steadily and
well.

Five minutes passed without result.
The spirits of the company sank to zero.
Such a grand scenting morning as it
seemed, too, and by the afternoon all the
conditions might have changed. Was
there anything so unfortunate ? Since
Captain Straighten's death a spell of ill-luck
had attended the hunt, and appeared
likely to continue. So these giants of the
chase bewailed themselves, like so many
fretful and pampered children, who have
not learnt to put up with the buffets of
fate. Then, all of a sudden their whole
mental attitude underwent a transformation
; for from a dozen canine throats there
came ringing out the deep, familiar music,
which soon increased in volume, and made
the echoes resound to its melodious notes.
How cheering, how inspiriting they were
to that sad multitude ! Every face beamed,

the lines of every mouth relaxed in a
satisfied smile. Already their anticipations
proved correct, and scent was good at all
events in covert. Eeynard took one
swift turn up and down the whole length
of the osier bed, hoping by so doing to
baffle his pursuers ; but they were hot and
keen, and left him little peace. Very
shortly, finding the position untenable, he
resolved to trust to his lissome limbs, and
without further hesitation set his mask
straight towards the open, boldly despising
cowardly tactics. His long, red body,
with its bushy brush could be seen stealing
over the grass at a raid rate. A hundred
pairs of eyes viewed him, and half a score
of manly voices simultaneously uttered a
loud " Gone forrard away." If anything
could have persuaded the fox to make
haste, those shrill demoniacal yells would
have done so. They alone were sufficient
to strike terror to the vulpine heart, and

convince its owner of the necessity of
exertion.

Quick as lightning hounds dashed out of
covert, and getting away close at their
fox's heels, flung eagerly forwards, without
once stooping to the scent. But at this
juncture so critical to the interests of sport,
those who ought to have known better,
pressed and flurried the little ladies to such
an extent, that they caused them to throw
up their heads, before having had a chance
of fairly settling to the line.

Hounds, gentlemen, please'' pleaded
Burnett half angrily, half imploringly. *' For
goodness sake don't ride a-top of 'em.
Steady there, steady."

Momentary as was the check that ensued
indeed, hardly worthy of the name  it
had its use, since it gave Eeynard an
advantage, of which he promptly availed
himself. A little breathing room was
desirable, if only to choose his route and

the best mode of effecting an escape. And
now the fun began in earnest. Hounds,
after their brief uncertainty, raced ahead
with a vigour delightful to behold. Over
the huge hundred-acre field sped the pursuers,
like an avalanche let loose, scattering
in every direction ; some making off for the
roads, some for the nearest gate, and others
boldly pointing their horses' heads towards
an extremely hih and formidable-looking
stake-bound hedge, through which the
flying hounds had already disappeared. It
was a " snorter " at starting, as more than
one good man and brave seemed to think.
Horses, too, like their masters, require
warming, and prefer a reasonable impediment
to begin with. Fortunately there
was no time to look and crane for those
who would be with hounds. It was a case
of harden your heart or lose your place,
perhaps for the whole run.

Doctor Lankester, Dot and Bob had

been fortunate in getting away well, and
were riding all in a cluster, only a few
lengths behind Burnett, who, in order to
keep within sight of his hounds, was
sendinf] his horse alonoj with a right goodwill.


Kingfisher, revelling in the enjoyment of
stretching his limbs, was mad fresh, and
pulled so hard that it was just as much as
his rider could do to hold him. The fence
was a big one, especially for the first, on an
unknown horse. As they sailed down at
sit, it looked even bigger, the take-off side
being ornamented by a very wide and
deep-cut ditch, into whose depths had
been stuffed sundry recently-cut twigs from
the newly-plashed hedge. A stiff binder
ran all along the top, as thick round as a
man's wrist. He who had fashioned this
formidable man-trap was evidently an
adept in the art, and knew how to defy
hunters as well as long horned, broad-bowed

oxen. Anyhow, lie could not have
devised a much more efficient stopper. But
Kingfisher felt so wonderfully game and
eager under her that Dot never hesitated
for a moment. She judged, and judged
rightly, that all the gallant horse wanted
was to be close up with hounds, and in a
position where he could see them constantly.


Burnett rode first at the fence, but his
horse got a little too near the ditch, and inconsequence
just toed the top-binder, which,
not yielding an inch, caused him to pitch
heavily on landing, though his practised
and powerful rider soon recovered him.
Kingfisher, wild with excitement, almost
tore the reins out of Dot's hands. His proud
spirit could not brook the sight of one
of his own race in front of him. The girl
tried her very best to steady him, but was
not successful in the attempt. As the next
best thing, she gave him his head entirely.

resolving not to hinder if she could not
help.

Oh ! he had misjudged his distance.
His stride was wrong ! A horrible sensation
of calamity made her heart standstill.
He was bound to fall. Not he !

As soon as he saw that black fringe of
twigs under his feet, he put in just one
little step, and the next moment gave a
glorious bound and landed light as a
chamois on the opposite side, clearing
those ugly binders by at least half a
foot.

The warm blood surged back to Dot's
heart in a triumphant wave, and elated all
her being. She no longer mistrusted her
horse, but, on the contrary, felt a wonderful
confidence in him.

"AVell done, Dot!" Dr. Lankester
shouted out approvingly, as Sugarloaf
landed within a few yards of her. " That
was a nasty fence and no mistake. It is

astonishing how many people have been
choked off already."

His words were true, for numbers were
still coasting up and down, in search of a
more practicable place, letting the precious
minutes slip by rather than risk their
necks over so uncompromising an impediment.
Even when a fox is found, he does
not always afford unmitigated pleasure to
the majority.

Meantime Bob, after seeing Dot safely
over, followed her example without delay.
His horse made a magnificent fly, but the
rider did not adhere to his saddle quite as
closely as might have been desired by an
observant critic. However, the trio were
now together again, and felt well pleased
with their performance, especially when
they noticed the very select company of
which they formed a part. It had become
evident that this was no day for shirking.

Hounds were gliding along the green

pastures at racing pace  mute, but intent
on murder  and those who would be with
them must take fence for fence, exactly as
it came, without losing a single second in
search of the convenient gate. Even when
they came to a deep-ploughed field, which
stretched the girths of many a gallant
steed, the scent still held good  too good
some of the poor horses would have said,
whose sides were panting, and whose
nostrils were distended, till their outline
formed an acute angle, beneath which the
scarlet membrane showed clearly

Take a pull, Dot ; take a pull," shouted
the doctor, as his daughter careered past
him like an arrow shot from a bow. " It's
very heavy going, remember."

I would if I could, father, but I can't.
He's so desperately keen, and I can't hold
him," she called back in reply.

Dr. Lankester glanced at the chestnut's
beautiful thoroughbred form, with its cast-iron

muscles and long, sweeping stride,
which covered the ground with the ease
of machinery, and nodded his head reassuringly.
There was not much fear of
harm befalling her on such a horse, and, ashe
had prophesied, she had the ' legs " of
Sugarloaf, on whom the deep ground told.

Dot's feather weight seemed nothing to
Kingfisher. He had been accustomed to
carry close upon fourteen stone, and he
simply revelled in the difference. This
slight, brave girl was one after his own
heart. Her delicate handling was even
superior to his late master's, and did not
interfere with his sensitive mouth. Could
he but have given his testimony he doubtless
would have agreed with the well-known
authority who stated " that there wouldn't
be many falls if there were no bridles'*
Nine times out of ten it is the men
themselves who are responsible for their
mishaps, since they expect an animal to

jump held hard by the head  a sheer
impossibility.

Creak, crack, crash I Half-a-dozen resolute
riders charged the next fence in line.
It proved to be a blind double into a road,
and was productive of many noisy scrambles,
and still noisier objurgations as horses
floundered into the near or far ditches.
Again Dot would have preferred to pull
Kingfisher up to a trot and make him go
slowly, but being more or less at his mercy
she was forced to let him take it in his own
fashion.

And his majesty pleased to fly the
double, instead of popping on and ofl the
bank. But he flew it in brilliant form,
though he rather over-shot the mark, since
neither his rider nor himself was prepared
for another fence leading out of the road,
over which the pack had sped with almost
undiminished speed. In fact he was so
taken by surprise that for the first and last

time in his life lie almost refused. Almost,
but not quite !

For the generous blood of the Harley
Arabian which flowed through his veins
recoiled at such an act of cowardice,
especially when hounds were running hard,
as in the present instance. Quick as
lightning he changed his mind, and hopped
over like a stag. To Bob, who followed
close in his wake, no sign of hesitation was
visible. That brief moment of indecision
remained a secret between Kingfisher and
his rider, and one of which he already felt
ashamed as he galloped swiftly on.

But Dot was more and more delighted
with her steed, and leaning forwards cooed
words of soft encouragement in his ear.
So far the line had been an uncommonly
stiff one and that double into the road
caused almost as much " grief " as the
starting fence. Dot saw no less than five
riderless horses gallop past her, and, un-vol.
III. 35

charitable as it may sound, the sifht
increased her satisfaction, for it was impossible
to help feeling that she had succeeded
where others had failed ; although
she was fully alive to the fact that the
merit of the achievement belonged almost
entirely to the finished performer on which
Mr. Jarrett had been good enough to
mount her. Was he amoni: the fallen ?
She hoped not. He deserved a better fate.
No, close up galloped his good brown
hunter, whilst Sugarloaf's white face was
creeping along steadily but surely. Both
Mr. Jarrett and her father had surmounted
the difficulties of the double, and helped to
swell the numbers of the little but resolute
band now left with hounds. They were
not many ; only about a dozen as far as
she could tell, and she was the only lady.

Dot's pulses throbbed with pride ; this
was indeed a red-letter day in her existence.


IF YOU MEAN LEAPING, DON't LOOK LONG."

Eeynard, still finding himself hotly pursued,
and beginning perhaps to feel a little
beat by the pace, now bore away to the
right, making for that beautiful, level grass
country which spreads like a green spring-board
between Worthington and Crackle.
Fences here were of a fairer character
and, to experienced hunters, rendered easy
by the good, sound turf that formed such
admirable taking-off and landis. No need
to do follow-my-leader now. With a few
exceptions half-a-dozen practicable spots
presented themselves in every hedge, and
the leaders sailed over each successive
obstacle without drawing rein. For the

35*

space of ten minutes it was more like
steeplechasing than hunting. As they
raced side by side horses laid back their
ears, and evidently enjoyed the emulation
as much as did their masters.

To Dot, the relief of being able to stride
aloof was immense. She could now let
Kingfisher gallop, and rest her over-strained
arms, the muscles of which had for sometime
past been quivering under the unaccustomed
tension. The gallant horse
stretched out his neck and snatched gaily
at the bit. A real fast things was what he
revelled in, and he felt satisfied at last.
With his fine blue eye fixed on the leading
hounds, and turning of his own accord, to
the right or to the left, exactly as he saw
them bend, lie maintained a forward place
throughout.

Between Dot and himself a complete
sympathy was by this time established.
He had lone: since realized that she meant

'going," and would neither irritate this
mouth nor baffle him at his fences, and she,
on her part, had discovered his pulling
arose solely from keenness and extra
anxiety, and that he was in all respects a
most brilliant and clever hunter. The
worst of it was, she could not help
breaking the tenth commandment, and
wishing he were her very own ; for when
other horses were falling to the rear, and
holding out signals of exhaustion, it was
such a delightful and intoxicating sensation
to feel that Kingfisher could easily maintain
his speed without distressing himself in the
slightest degree, since whilst his companions
were galloping he was only cantering.

This knowledge added still more to Dot's
elation. Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks
were adorned by a warm flush that made
them very beautiful to look at, and her
small mouth opened in panting ecstasy.
Oh! this was glorious. The enjoyment of

a lifetime seemed compressed into these
fleeting minutes. She felt a different being,
transported out of her usual, quiet, humdrum
self. Such a run made one believe
that life was worth living, and was a rich
and inestimable blessing for which people
themselves were to be blamed if they did
not enjoy. Danger! Who thought of
damper when the blood coursed like wildfire
in one's veins, and one's whole being
thrilled with the rapture of the chase ?
How strange that same rapture was, too,
when one came to reflect upon it. All the
host of horsemen and women, all the staff
and retinue and expense, all the emulation,
the heart-burnings. the ambition, the short-lived
triumphs and long remembered disappointments,
just for a little red animal.
Wherein did the attraction and fascination
consist ? It was a species of madness, buta
madness more insidious and exciting than
any known pleasure. The sense of pure

animal enjoyment was so great. And yet
when the day was done, when the fever had
cooled and the chase over, what gain did it
bring ! what profit to the mind ? Very
little, if the answer were given truthfully.
Bumps and blows and bruises to the body,
and nought, or next to nought, to the
brain.

Some such thoughts flashed thrush
Dot's mind as she continued her victorious
career and tried to analyze the strength
and keenness of her emotions. But it was
no time for introspective reflections.
Another fence loomed ahead, and she
promptly had to abandon them. There
was a burning scent on the grass.
The pace increased until it became something
terrific, and the company rapidly
grew more and more select. A hurried,
backward view revealed a tail nearly a
mile in length, and the fields were dotted
with black and scarlet specks, labouring

along as best they could, and riding that
hardest of all hard rides  a stern chase.

Those immediately with hounds might
have been counted on the fingers of one's
two hands. On the left was Burnett, his
horse showing unmistakable symptoms of
having had enough. In his rear, a gallant
cavalry officer, and a hard-riding farmer,
mounted on a wonderful screw, that for
several seasons past had scoffed at three
and four hundred guinea hunters, with
their sound limbs too good for use, and
their big bodies full of thirty-three shillings
a quarter oats. To the right, trying hard
to maintain his pride of place, yet with the
pace all the time against him, Doctor
Lankester cut out the work, and continued
to make a gallant struggle on his good
grey mare. But her elevated tail and
drooping head showed that her bolt also
was nearly shot, unless an opportune check
took place soon to enable her to get her

wind. Sugarloaf was fast, but not a racer,
and she had been asked to go at topmost
speed for the last twenty minutes ; only her
stout heart had kept her in the van so long.
A solitary attendant followed the doctor's
fortunes, a lad of sixteen or seventeen,
riding a thoroughbred horse with a
pedigree a yard long, who was being
qualified for hunt steeplechases, and who,
in spite of having embraced mother earth,
was still to the fore.

The central group consisted of Bob
Jarrett and a remarkably select contingent.
Served by the excellence of his nag, the
former had for some time past gallantly
shown the way to his immediate division,
which consisted only of Dot Lankester and
two well-known members of the hunt.
Bob was riding a young blood-hunter of
very superior quality, else he could never
have held his own.

But what he wanted in experience he

made up for in " pluck," and Dot could not
help admiring the lion-hearted manner in
which on one or two occasions he led the
whole field. Courage always appeals to a
woman. There are few things for which
she entertains a greater liking and respect.
Let her once convict a man of cowardice,
and she never thinks the same of him
again. He may be ever so nice, in a
hundred different ways, but henceforth she
invariably views him with a certain
amount of contempt. Bob's nerve won
him golden opinions from Dot, and once
or twice her smile of approbation made his
heart beat fast with rising hope.

And now, this bold, stout-hearted fox,
finding that as long as he kept to the grass
his enemies pressed upon him closer and
closer, resolved to make one last bid for his
brush. He therefore tried the effect of a
little dodging. No doubt he was pretty
well done, and. therefore hailed the close

proximity of a village with thanksgiving.
A few ingenious turns and twists mijlit
baffle his mortal foes even at the eleventh
hour.

So he carefully wended his way through
gardens and farmyards, past cottages and
barns and outhouses. Yet the shelter he
sought he could not find. None seemed
entirely safe, not even that old, hollow tree
standing in an orchard, whose roots had
formed many little tortuous tunnels under
the brown earth. Possibly, spades and fox-terriers
flashed across his mind's eye.

Nevertheless, he succeeded in embarrassing
his pursuers, and in obtaining
a few minutes' respite. Just five and forty
minutes after he had left the osier-bed,
hounds threw up their heads, and looking
uncertainly about them, came to a sudden
halt within one field of Marlborough
village. Horsemen flun themselves from
their panting steeds, and critically examined

scratched legs and spur-marked sides,
holding the bridles in their hands so as to
be able to remount at any moment. But
the poor nags seemed in no hurry to renew
their exertions  quivering tails, heaving
flanks, outstretched necks, told a sad tale
of distress in the majority of cases.

Meantime, hounds were feathering about
in several directions, with noses and sterns
both busy. Burnett let them try to puzzle
it out, but they failed to take up the line.
Then, with a ringing cheer and a " hic
forrard, forrard, m} beauties ! " he lifted
them, and made a scientific cast, whilst his
followers watched the proceedings without
moving, and wondered how the dickens it
was, that in ten good runs out of a dozen,
those infernal roadsters invariably contrived
to turn up just when they were not wanted,
and did the greatest possible amount of
mischief. Helter - skelter, gallop - gallop,
here they come, clattering over the stony

macadam at topmost speed, and with a
ruthless disregard for joints and sinews.
Such a noise as they made too. A regiment
of soldiers would have appeared
silent as mice in comparison.

Of course they headed the fox. That
was a foregone conclusion, for was there
ever a roadster who didn't ? But to this
fact the whole tribe are contemptuously indifferent.
They don't go out to hunt but
to gallop. Not on the grass, mind you.
Not over the spacious green fields where
they could do little harm. No ; they are
afraid. They might come across mole-hills,
or rabbit-holes, or even have to jump, an
idea which makes the blood in their veins
run cold. Only on the road do they feel
safe from all such horrid possibilities, and
therefore to the road do they cleave, like
limpets to a rock. But we will give the
mighty army of roadsters their due, and todo
them justice, they can talk. Not one of

the number who has not some marvellous
experiences to record, and who is not
supremely satisfied with his individual
performances. Perhaps it is only natural
that the men who have jumped every fence
as it came, without shirking, who have
imperilled their limbs, if not their necks,
and made acquaintance with mother earth
in her hardest and most disagreeable form
namely, when she rises up and greets you
between the eyes  should harbour a contemptuous
hostility against the spiritless
babblers who come swarming around the
moment all danger is over.

But by this time Burnett had succeeded
in hitting off the line of his fox. Whilst
trotting down a road the hounds suddenly
stopped, and one by one, creeping under a
stiff, hog-backed stile, once more threw
their tongues in deadly fashion, which
made all the dismounted gentlemen leap to
their horse's backs, tossing away just lit

cigars and half tasted sandwiches. Perhaps
they would not have been in quite such a
hurry had they known what a formidable
obstacle awaited them.

Their ardour had cooled a little, and few
of the horses displayed much spirit. They
would have preferred some extra minutes'
repose, but it was not to be. In spite of
the pace, Eeynard had still a fair share of
life left in him.

Nevertheless, that same hog-backed stile
was by no means a pleasing prospect to
tired out animals still catching their
breath. Yet there was not any other egress,
the fence on either side being quite seven
feet high, and as thick and solid as a stonewall.
The things had to be done, but nobody
liked to attempt it first. Even
Burnett paused, though the exhausted
condition of his horse rendered the delay
not merely wise, but imperative. If only
hounds would check. But no; they stole

ahead with renewed confidence, every now
and again one or other of them giving
tongue, and all their bristles up, as if their
fox were quite close in front.

Doctor Lankester was a brave man,
and, in spite of his forty odd years, had
nerves of iron. His blood was up. Sugar-loaf
happened to be particularly good at
timber, and she had in a measure regained
her wind. His daughter and Mr. Jarrett
were among the little anxious throng who
blocked the roadway. (The roadsters had
already galloped off.)

Dot knew the meaning of that keen
sparkle in her father's eye, accompanied by
a sudden contraction of the brow. It
signified business.

You are not going to jump it, are you,
papa ? " she inquired with some uneasiness.


Yes," came the resolute reply. Then,
looking round, he sang out, quoting the

Australian poet, poor Adam Lindsay
Gordon, for whose verses lie entertained a
great admiration :

Look before you leap if you like,

But if you mean leaping, don't look long,
Or the weakest place will soon grow stiff,
And the strongest doubly strong."

Give me a little room, there's good
fellows," he wound up persuasively.

And with that he went at the stile.

A tremendous rattle. Sugarloaf hit all
round, but the pair were over with a
scramble. Doctor Lankester looked back
to see who would follow his example. It
was a very awkward leap after so long and
fast a run. Still, was nobody coming ?

Yes, there was one, and one moreover of
his own kith and kin. He shuddered and
closed his eyes. The girl inherited her
father's spirit, but he had rather she had
been less brave. He tried to call out and
tell her not to come, but Dot had already
started.

VOL III. 36

She set Kingfisher resolutely at the stile,
and just touched him-with her hunting crop.
Bob uttered an exclamation of alarm,
which immediately changed to one of admiration,
for the noble hunter, getting his
leofs well under him, bounded with the
lightness and springiness of a fawn over
the stiff, unyielding timber, giving a playful
grunt of satisfaction as he landed. Dot
patted his swelling neck enthusiastically.
He was a king among hunters.

Oh, you beauty ! You are a real
ripper ! " she exclaimed, using a slang expression
for want of any better to convey
the full warmth of her sentiments.

Bob felt he should despise himself if he
were outdone by a woman, but more
especially by such a. slight, delicate-bodied
little thing. Besides, he could not bear tolet
her out of his sight. His love was
rapidly becoming a vehement passion.
Therefore he also rode at the stile, but

he went at it a little too fast, and giving
his horse a job in the mouth, flurried him
unnecessarily. As a consequence, Paragon
caught the top bar with both knees, and
executed a complete somersault, for some
little time lying quite motionless where he
fell.

When Bob rose from the ground he
found that Dot had pulled up, and was
looking commiserating down at him, with
an air of anxious pity disquieting her sweet,
young face.

Oh, Mr. Jarrett ! " she cried, " are you
hurt ? "

No, not a bit," he answered cheerily.
"Don't wait for me; I'm all right, and
hounds are still running. I shall be in at
the death yet. You go on."

As he turned to put his foot in the
stirrup  Paragon fortunately having stood
still after his fall  Bob suddenly became
aware of the fact that a pair of very blue

36*

ejes were staring at him from the road
with an exceedingly scornful and outraged
expression. Their owner wore a scarlet
jacket, and had arrived on the scene justin
time to witness Dot Lankester's bold
jump and Bob's unsuccessful attempt to
follow suit.

"You'd have done much better if you
had taken my advice, and stuck to the
roads," she called out sarcastically, and
with no evidence of concern at his mishap.

I don't think so, sour ladyship, though
I admit that it's all a matter of opinion."

Who's your friend ? " she rejoined, in a
tone which made his blood boil.

But he ignored this interrogation
altogether, and galloped off in pursuit of
the hounds, who were quite a couple of
fields ahead, gaining inch by inch upon the
failing quarry, whose aim was now evident
to those acquainted with the country.
As his last resource, poor Pug was

gallantly trying to make for some earths
about two miles distant from Smallborouorh,
in whose safe depths many a hunted fox
had ere now saved his brush. Would he
reach them or would he not ? If he did,
should he find them open or closed? How
his vulpine heart must have beat with
anxiety. For the answer to this question
meant life or death to him.

The poor little red animal was very, very
weary. His beautiful brush was all draggled
and soiled, his limbs were stiff, his
body damp with perspiration.

Hounds, horses, men, all were against
him, and yet for the best part of an hour he
had defied them with indomitable energy.

Surely he deserved his life. If foxes
must pay the penalty, then let the bad ones
go, and leave the good, straight-running,
stout-hearted fellows for another day.

They are not so plentiful that we should
slay them willingly, or rejoice when we do

SO. Courage, even in the much-maligned
thief of the world," merits some recognition.
A good fox plays a desperate game,
and if he wins, none should grudge him
the victory. In any case, the pains and
terrors of death have been anticipated.

Only an animal," say some. '' It does
not matter whether it suffers or not."

Perhaps so ; yet how know these good
folk, with their narrow-minded positivism,
that man differs from the brute creation as
greatly as they flatter themselves ? There
are some very strange points of similitude ;
amongst others the burden of pain which
every living thing has to bear, and which
incontestably connects beast and biped.
Life is painful, so is death, to all creatures
created by God.

The hunted animal straining every nerve
to escape from his tormentors, may not
possess a soul, according to our sense of
the word, but yet he feels.

Ein TO GROUND.

Dot LxVnkester for one, had no wish to seethe
poor fox killed. Her tender heart
recoiled from any approach to cruelty, and,
much as she delighted in the fun, the
movement and excitement of hunting, the
final obsequies always brought a sense of
depression, not wholly free from disgust.
Her sympathies were invariably with the
blain, not the slayers. If the chase could
have been conducted without destroying
life, she would have liked it even better
than she did, for she never could bear to
witness the tortured creature's dying
struggles, or the subsequent dismemberment
of his stiffened body. Well and

pluckily as she rode to hounds, she was
essentially feminine by nature, and had alla
true woman's sympathy with and compassion
for suffering in every shape or

form.

Therefore it was an intense relief to her
feelings when, too closely pressed to reach
the earths already spoken of, Pug, to the
infinite disappointment of huntsman and
hounds, succeeded in gaining the shelter
of an unsuspected drain, running across one
corner of a large grass field. For several
minutes previously the eager pack had
raced him in full view of the scarcely less
easier field. Horses and men alike caught
the enthusiasm of their canine friends. The
air rang with different cries proceeding from
many throats, human and otherwise. Twice
old Merry lass, always foremost in the fray,
and leading by a good couple of lengths,
snapped at him, and almost rolled him
over. Despair lent him fresh fleetness of

foot, but such supreme effort could not be
maintained. It seemed any odds against
the fox. Fifty seconds more, and they
must have had him, when suddenly he
disappeared from vision.

A dismal howl burst from his thwarted
foes, as with hanging tongues and open
jowls, they gathered round the small
aperture through which their prey had
squeezed, but which would not allow of
the passage of their larger bodies. They
felt themselves baffled when most they
deserved success, and took the disappointment
sorely to heart, as their angry and
excited baying testified.

Once more horsemen dismounted, and
horses opened their heated nostrils to the
refreshing breeze, and stood panting, whilst
the white foam on their sides and necks
gradually hardened and grew stiff. Then
watches were produced from waistcoat
pockets and compared minutely.

After some consultation, it was agreed
that this fine run, including the slight
check at the commencement, and the
longer one in Smallborough village, had
lasted exactly one hour and a half ; the
first forty-five minutes at racing pace, the
remainder slower, but still sufficiently fast
to tax the powers of most ordinary hunters.
Of the stoutness and gallantry of the fox
there could be no two opinions, since
Burnett was confident he was the same
animal that had been viewed away from
the osier-bed. Even those most murderously
inclined admitted that so gallant a
fellow deserved his life ; but huntsmen are
proverbially a blood-thirsty race, actuated
by few sentiments of pity, and Burnett
was no exception to the rule. His
humanity was completely subordinate to
the love he bore his hounds, and he
could not bear to see his darlings deprived
of their due. The better they had hunted,

the more they merited reward. They
deserved blood, and blood  if it were
possible  he was determined they should
have, and for himself another mask to
hang up over the kennel door.

Therefore one of the whips was immediately
despatched to borrow spades and a
terrier. He shortly reappeared on the
scene, accompanied by a small army of
idle men and boys, who had gleefully
sallied forth from Smallborouo'h in order
to watch the chase, and who now set to
work with a will at either end of the
drain, which they sought to enlarge. As is
usual on such occasions, every one had
either an opinion or advice to offer. After
a while, the proceedings, being unattended
by success, grew wearisome to a degree.
No amount of digging could persuade
Eeynard to bolt. He altogether declined
a fresh contest, preferring to endure a
martyrdom of terror rather than face that

row of cruel, wide-open mouths, with their
hot breath and sharp white teeth.

When over half-an-hour had gone by,
and some significant grumbling began to
be heard amongst the best subscribers to
the hunt, Burnett was at length reluctantly-forced
to give the fox up.

It was too soon to go home, so, though
hounds and horses had had pretty well
enough, Lord Littelbrane resolved to draw
again ; a decision which met with the
approval of the majority.

When this was finally settled and people
began to move ofT, Dot, who had been
talking to some friends, rode up to Bob's
side and said :

Mr. Jarrett, I come to you for instructions."


"What about," he replied. "I hope
you do not look upon me as a mentor."

Oh ! dear no ; but as I am riding your
horse I do not like to keep him out longer

than you tliirik fit. Therefore will you tell
me honestly if I ought to go home ? "

And will you tell me in the same frank
and candid spirit, whether you yourself are
tired?"

I ? Not a bit. I mean," endeavouring
to be strictly truthful, " only a very little."

And you would like just to see what
hounds do, of course. Come, Miss Lankester,
confess."

Well, yes, I should ; if you don't mind
about Kingfisher."

Mind ? Why should I mind ? As far
as 1 can judge he is fresher than any other
horse that went through the run. He
makes nothing of your weight."

I don't think you could do the horse
any harm by staying out a little longer,
Dot," here interposed her father, who had
overheard the above conversation. " Lord
Littelbrane has given Burnett orders to
draw Hawthorne, which is all on our way

home, and if the hounds don't find there,
they are bound to jog back in the direction
of the kennels. So let's be starting. Our
horses have 2fot cold enough as it is. That
digging-out work is always detestable."

Hounds and huntsman now made a fresh
move, followed by a procession, considerably
diminished since the morning, though
what it wanted in quantity it made up for
in quality those who remained to test the
further fortunes of the day being mostly
good men and true.

Burnett let the hounds proceed at a
leisurely pace. They still seemed tired
after their recent exertions, and a bit down-hearted
at the escape of their fox, on whom
they had surely counted. Neither did the
old hunters present appear to approve of
this new call on their powers. After being
at fever-heat their blood had got thoroughly
chilled, from standing about so loncf in the
cold afternoon air, and many of them

seemed very stiff and weary, their morning
ardour having entirely evaporated.

Bob had been looking about for his
second horseman, who, up till now, had
failed to put in an appearance, but just as
the cavalcade was jogging slowly along
through Smallborough, and the public-houses
were being besieged by a thirsty
host for beer, or anything they could
produce in the way of drink, he spied him
issuing from a back yard, and immediately
changed horses.

Paragon had probably sprained himself
when he fell, for he was now quite lame,
and Bob felt only too glad to get off his
back, since nothing is more trying to the
feelings of a humane man than to be forced
to ride a tired and halting animal. That
irregular bobbing up and down of the ears
is a most unpleasant sight to tender-hearted
people.

By the time Bob had scolded his groom

for not having come up with the others,
given him strict orders not to take Paragon
out of a walk, and made friends with this
fresh steed  a very handsome bay, with
rather a wicked eye  he had fallen some
little way in the rear of his companions.
He was just emerging from the yard where
he had mounted, with the intention of
making up lost ground, when, to his
infinite discomfiture, he found himself
suddenly accosted by no less a person than
Lady De Fochsey. He smothered an
exclamation of annoyance.

Nemesis seemed to pursue him in the
shape of this woman, and he blamed
himself a thousand times for ever having
been such a weak fool as to give her
encouragement, when he knew quite well
in his own heart that she was, and always
would be, absolutely indifferent to him.
I3ut he would take precious good care how
he did so ao-ain. He wanted none of her

specious entanglements and artificial love-making.
He might, perhaps, have forgiven
her for being silly, but he could not
forgive her for being? a bore. Oh! if
Lady De Fochsey could have read his
thoughts !

But her ladyship also nourished a
grievance, and felt she had a crow to
pluck with her quondam friend. He had
been singularly inattentive throughout the
day, and being both piqued and indignant
she wanted to know the reason wdiy her
spiritual affinity had not responded more
readily to the advances graciously made
him. Were they of too delicate and
impalpable a nature ? She could hardly
believe it.

Though caring for hunting more on
account of the society than the sport. Lady
De Fochsey went fairly well at times,
especially when she wished to impress an
admirer with her powers of equitation.
VOL. ]ir. 37

She had been quite ready to do this in
Bob's case, had he but given her a chance
and displayed just a little consideration ;
but that stake-bound fence was a size too
big, and choked her off at starting. As
well as she could, she had sedulously-striven
to keep an eye upon the young
inane but her jealousy had not been fully
aroused until she witnessed his attempt to
follow Dot Lankester out of the road andover
the stile. Having scuttled round by
a gate, and the concluding portion of the
run being over a comparatively easy
country, she had ridden the line after a
fashion.

True, forty or fifty people going first,
contrived to divest the fences of much of
their stiffness, but still her ladyship was
near enough to hounds to be able to see
what the leaders were about. And each
time she looked she saw her medium  her
annuity  her precious psychological educator,

ridings with that little insignificant
slip of a girl on the chestnut horse.

Who could this young person be ? She
Lady De Foclisey  had not the slightest
kno ,pledge of her, had never even noticed
her out hunting before, though of course
had it not been for Mr. Jarrett's absurd conduct,
there was no reason why she should.

The young person  it pleased her to
designate her enemy thus  evidently moved
in a humble social sphere. She was a
nobody. Why ? Oh ! because of her
get up." The tail of Dot's habit-body
(Lady De Foclisey never had an opportunity
of seeing the front) was cut in a fashion
quite four years old, and moreover it was
ornamented by four buttons below the
waist instead of two ; a thing which, in the
eyes of a lady who wore " pink," stamped
the owner at once. Every woman in
society knew that four buttons had gone
out ever so long? ao, indeed that they had

never met with approval amongst the elite.
Dot's habit proclaimed her insignificance.

All the same, Lady De Fochsey scented
a rival, and was agitated by the mere
suspicion of Mr. Jarrett's proving indifferent
to her own charms. It would be beyond a
joke if, when for the first and last time in
her life she had fallen desperately in love
with a man, because she recognised in him
certain lofty attributes which harmonized
with her own nature, that man were to
have the audacity and the inconceivable
bad taste to get up a flirtation with another
woman right under her very nose. The
thing must be inquired into, and ime :lately.


Well ! Mr. Jarrett," she exclaimed
with forced amiability. " I have hardly
had a word with you to-day."

He bowed. *' No, your ladyship.
Hounds have kept us otherwise employed."


Ah ! those hounds. I don't know
whether to feel angry with them or not.
But, no matter. Have you enjoyed
yourself ? "

Exceedingly, up to the present
moment."

You have friends staying with you,
have you not ? " she inquired, as they
trotted on at a brisk pace.

Oh, dear, no," he answered, thrown
off his guard. " What made you think
so ?"

Isn't the beautiful being staying at
Straighten! with whom you haVe been
riding about all day long, to the total
exclusion of your other acquaintances ? "
She could not help infusing a little vinegar
into the interrogation.

I have hardly any acquaintances
except yourself, and really," reddening to
the roots of his hair, " I do not know
whom you mean by the ' beautiful being.' "

Oh ! nonsense, don't pretend to be so
innocent. You know quite well that I'm
talking about that little dowdy girl, in the
funny old-fashioned habit, which looks
as if it belonged to some antediluvian
period."

Bob bit his lips, but made no reply.
To tell the truth, he was too much annoyed
to speak, unless absolutely obliged. But
his companion left him no peace.

Who is she ? " she persisted, bent on
satisfying her curiosity'.

She is what every woman is not," he
rejoined shortly, " a lady."

It was her turn to colour now. The
words mii:rht have meant nothing, but she
did not exactly like them, especially coming
from him.

"Oh! of course," she retaliated with a
toss of her head. " One takes that for
granted, but even if she is a lady, I
suppose so remarkable a fact, and one I

should never have guessed without being
told, does not prevent her from having a

name."

"Xo, naturally it does not."

Well? dear me, how tiresome you are,
what is it ? "

"Lankester," said Bob with extreme
reluctance, wishing he misfht sink into the
earth; or she might sink into the earth, so
as to put an end to this odious and embarrassing
cross-examination.

"What!" exclaimed Lady De Fochsey
sneeringly. " The wife of the little doctor
who rides so hard, and who, now I come to
think of it, lives in your village ? "

Neo, not the wife ; the daughter."

"The daughter. But, my dear Bob,
that's ever so much worse."

I really can't see why," he retorted, beginning
to lose his temper.

Can't you. A flirtation with a married
woman in so humble a sphere may be

ridiculous, but it is not likely to have any
serious consequences."

I don't know what you mean b}
serious consequences,' " he said angrily.

She lifted up her head and looked him
straight in the face.

Bob'' she said impressively, " I think
you know me well enough by this time to
be aware how thoroughly I have your
interest at heart."

I am sure you are very good," he
mumbled sheepishly, not knowing exactly
what to say in return.

*' Not at all, but I intend to presume
upon our friendship to give you some
sensible advice, which I hope you will
take in the same spirit as it is meant."

Thanks, you are awfully kind, Lady De
Fochsey ; but really, I'm not particularly
fond of advice."

'* Never mind, it's for your good."

BOB AND HIS Kindred SPIRIT FALL OUT.

*' Advice generally is for one's good, in the
opinion of the giver, though not always
in that of the recipient," he said
plaintively.

Now, look here Bob, if you don't
look out, you'll end by making a fool of
yourself."

Thank you, Lady De Fochsey. Is
that what you wanted to say ? "

Partly, but not entirely ; I wish to bring
the fact home to your mind. You have
evidently taken some sort of silly, boyish
fancy to this young person whose name is
Lankester "

Miss Lankester," he interrupted sternly.

"Well, Miss Lankester, if you like it
better," she resumed, a little frightened by
his tone ; " we need not quarrel about a
mere matter of nomenclature. But what
T intended to say was this : It won't do,"
looking at him fixedly ; " you'll have to
drop it."

If she had been a man, he could have
struck her. As it was, he made a powerful
effort, and curbed his wrath sufficiently
to say, with what was meant for biting
sarcasm :

"I'm much obliged to your ladyship,
and if all advice were like yours its frankness
would atone for its singularity. But
allow me to state that it is quite uncalled
for."

"Bob, Bob, don't be so foolish and stiffened."


I may be foolish, but I am not stiffened."


Yes, you are  both. You are falling

into a regular trap, and wilfully shutting
your e3es to facts."

Trap is a very strong word to employ."

It may be, but it's the only one that
correctly expresses the state of affairs.
Those people are making a most shameful
set at }'ou, especially the girl  little impudent
minx ! "

No such thing," he said indignantly.
You are very much mistaken there."

Her ladyship gave a superior smile, which
seemed to say, " Tut, it's absurd to deny
the truth. You can't deceive me ; I'm far
too sharp." Then she said with ever increasing:
animation :

The fact of the matter is. Bob, you are
new to English life, and don't understand
all the petty plotting and scheming that
goes on in our country villages to secure a
rich young man with twelve or fifteen
thousand a year, for a husband. No doubt
it woukl be a very excellent tiling for Miss

Lankester, the doctor's (laughter, to become
Mrs. Robert Jarrett, and mistress of
Straighten Court. But looking upon it
impartial, would it be quite so excellent
a thing for Mr. Eobert Jarrett? There
can be but one answer to that question.
Certainly not. Mr. Jarrett would lose by
the connection, and do himself an infinity
of harm. This is a very fastidious neighbourhood.
Fortune has placed you in an
elevated position, but if you wish not to
disgrace that position, and to get on in the
county, sou must marry some one of birth
belonging to your own station, instead of
the first little nobody who happens to take
your fancy. Bob, dear Bob," haying her
hand on his horse's mane for a second, and
looking coaxingly up into his face, "I
don't think you ought to have much
difficulty in finding a suitable person, if
you are really and truly desirous of getting
married."

He was by no means a vain man, yet ashe
bashfully turned away his head, so as
to avoid her winning glances, he could not
prevent certain embarrassing thoughts
from flashing? across his brain. If he were
not very prudent in his conduct, this
woman was quite capable of getting him
into a most horrible mess almost before he
knew what he was about ; she was so
artful, so insinuating, so  so S7iake-\ike.
He was fiercely vexed, too, at having his
secret dragged to light and dissected in
this ruthless manner. Had he been sure
of Dot's sentiments, it might not have
mattered so much, but as things were,
it was insufferable hearing his affairs
discussed.

I don't care twopence whether I get on
in the county or not," he said irritably.
And as for getting married  surely one
may speak to a girl without being immediately
accused of making love to her."

I said that this Miss Lankester was
making love to you."

Then, Lady De Fochsey, you said what
was not true, and I must ask you not to
repeat the remark."

Hoity, toity ! What a temper you've
got, to be sure. It strikes me the ' beautiful
being ' has played her cards uncommonly
well, to have produced so great an
impression in so short a space of time."

Lady De Fochsey was aware of the fact
that in letting her jealousy get the better
of her prudence, she was only losing
ground, but she could not help herself.
She was too angry and too mortified to be
wise.

"You don't seem to understand," said
Bob, trying to allay .his companion's suspicions,
" that it is but natural I should
feel gratefully inclined towards the only
people who have shown me any civility
since I set foot in Stifl'shire."

Here was an opening of wliicli she
promptly took avail.

Oh ! Bob ! how can you say such a
thing ? Have not / shown you civility,
and  and  " lowering her voice to a
caressing whisper  " would not I show
you ever so much more, if only you would
let me ? It is you who are stand-ofF, not
me."

There's a great difference between being
stand-ofF and being too gushing," he
replied with downright brutality, feeling
that this must be put a stop to at once if
he would retain his liberty of action.

The remark incensed her beyond measure,
proving as it did, that she had completely
failed to produce any permanent impression.

I suppose you mean to imply that /
am too gushing, because I was foolish
enough to think you a kindred spirit. Let
me assure you, I have quite recovered
from the delusion." And she drew herself

up and looked at him with flashing eyes ;
for this last observation of his had offended
her past forgiveness.

Indeed, Lady De Fochsey, I had no
intention of hurting your feelings."

"Pooh! my feelings" (hysterically).
What do you care for them ? Go to
your doctor's daughter, since you have the
bad taste to prefer her to me. I shall rise
high in the astral plane, but you  you will
sink, dragged down by your low connections,
and in all probability reappear in some
future existence as a donkey or an ape.
That will be your fate, and one most richly
deserved, for you possessed possibilities of
ennoblement, and refused to develop them ;
opportunities of psychic'culture were given
you, but your base, sensual, material nature
triumphed over thediviner elements, and
3'ou proved yourself unworthy. Good-bye,
Mr. Barrett ; I have done with you for ever.
Some day, when my free and emancipated

spirit is soaring in waves of ether, yours
will be prisoned in a low, bestial form,
degraded and debased by your own fault,
and by your wilful insensibility to elevating
influences."

And so saying, the outraged and
'' charming " woman rode swiftly away,
leaving her companion in a state of utter
bewilderment. What had he done to
provoke her wrath ? Again and again he
tried to assign a reason. He could not
believe that jealousy alone was responsible
for such extraordinary behaviour, and
finally fell back upon the conclusion that
most decidedly she had a bee in her bonnet.
Well ! he had got rid of her at any rate,
which was something, though he was sorry
an actual rupture should have taken place.
Still he scarcely blamed himself. Her
ladyship's conduct from first to last had
been eccentric, embarrassing and impossible.
VOL. III. 38

Was it his fault that he could not respond
to her advances, or profess a belief in all
the spiritualistic shams she employed, as a
cloak to sanctify her flirtations ? He
hardly thought so. Anyhow a good
hunting run of three quarters of an
hour soon caused him to dismiss the
matter from his mind  at least temporarily.

When the chase was over, and the
Lankesters turned their horses' heads
towards home, he immediately followed
suit. He was beginning to feel almost
like one of the family, and the day's
sport had done a great deal to consolidate
friendship on either side.

In Doctor Lankester's presence, the conversation
could not assume a very personal
character and almost as if she were conscious
of this fact, Dot chatted away with
unusual freedom and gaiety.

Are you coming to our hunt steeplechases,
Mr. Jarrett ? " she inquired, after

every incident of the two runs had been
fully discussed with retrospective satisfaction.


What races ? " he asked, making the
question an excuse to sidle close up to
Kingfisher.

"TheMorbey Anstead meeting. It comes
off at the end of next week."

This is the first I've heard of it. You
see how remiss I am in the county news.
Are you going by any chance ? " glancing
shyly at her.

I haven't an idea. It depends so much
upon papa. But I should like to go
immensely."

Bob made no immediate reply. He was
maturing a most delightful plan which,
at her words, seized strong hold of his
imagination, and opened out fresh opportunities
of meeting.

Look here, doctor," he said after a bit,
you and your daughter and Mrs.

?)8*

Lankester had much better come to these
races with me. It's no use our going in
separate traps when we live so close to one
another. There's a big old omnibus in my
coach-house, which would be just the thing
for a day's outing, and of course I'll
provide lunch, drink and all the rest of it.
Eh ! what do you say to the proposition ? "

An excellent one, as far as the
Lankester family are concerned," replied
the doctor heartily, who by this time had
conceived a wonderful fancy for Bob, and
accepted this offer of hospitality without
any feelings of false pride. " I think I can
answer for Dot, and as for myself, next to
a day's hunting, there's nothing I like more
than a day's steeplechasing, if only I can
leave my patients."

That's settled, then," said Bob. " Miss
Dot," turning to the girl, " I count upon
you not to forget the arrangement, or to
throw nie over at the last moment."

Very well, Mr. Jarrett," she replied,
thinking how kind and good-natured he
was. " I shall endeavour to prove that
your confidence is not misplaced. But you
will spoil us if you go on at this rate."

They continued their homeward journey
until the red-brick houses of Straighten
village peered through the misty twilight.
The moment had come to part. Bob
reluctantly held out his hand. The doctor
wrung it warmly. His wife's statement
was quite forgotten, therefore he could
behave naturally.

Good-bye, Jarrett," he exclaimed. " I
am sorry this pleasant day has come to an
end."

And so am I," rejoined Bob ; " but I
hope we shall spend many similar ones in
each other's company. Good-bye, Miss
Dot," with the blood surging to his cheek.
"Have you also enjoyed yourself"

Immensely," she replied enthusiastically.

Tien, feeling that she could not let
him go without expressing her gratitude in
more orthodox form, she added in tones
full of genuine emotion :

I shall look back to to-day all my life,
and I only wish, Mr. Jarrett, that I could
thank you properly for your kindness, but
that is impossible ; nevertheless, believe
me, I appreciate it none the less."

Tut ! Don't make me feel uncomfortable
by exalting an ordinary act of
friendship into one of generosity. And
look here. Miss Dot, now that you have
made Kingfisher's acquaintance, and he has
proved himself worthy of the honour of
carrying you to hounds, I want you to
take him whenever you like. From this
moment consider him yours, to do exactly
what you please with ; I shan't ride him
this winter."

Oh ! but, Mr. Jarrett, indeed you must.
Why ! he is your best horse."

All the more reason for you to have
him. He will stand in my stables, because
he is used to them, and I have promised
old Matthews never to part with him
actually; but whenever you want to go
hunting, even if your father cannot come,
just send me word, and Kingfisher shall be
ready."

As she looked at Bob's honest face, and
with a pang of pain noted the admiration
shining from his eyes, the tears insensibly
welled up into her own. She was deeply
touched  more even than she liked to let
him see.

Mr. Jarrett," she said, in an undertone
not meant even for her father's ears, " you
are too good. Don't think me ungrateful,
but, indeed  indeed  I cannot ride Kingfisher
any more."

Why not ? " he asked in surprise.
Don't you like him ? "

"Oh! yes. It's not that. He's simply

perfection. But  but " growing more

and more confused.

What is it, then ? You need not be
afraid to tell me, surely."

There  there is a reason," she said,
turning as red as a rose, " but I can't mention
it just now. Some day perhaps you
shall know." And with this she was
gone.

He smiled. A feeling of exultation took
possession of him. He thought he understood
the workings of her mind. She was
proud, and did not like placing herself
under an obligation. He approved of her
independent spirit. In her place, he told
himself, he should have acted the same.
After Lady De Fochsey's insinuations, had
she appeared the least eager to attract, or
anxious to get what she could out of him,
then his respect and his admiration would
have received a blow. As it was, he
believed in her thoroughly. With that

face, and those eyes, she could not be anything
but pure and innocent. Evidently,
she did not realize as yet how much in
earnest he was. That was quite clear.

But it would be very, very pleasant to
his feelings, teaching her gradually, and
from day to day, to rely upon him, to lookup
to him as her natural stay and support,
until at last she fully understood that all
he had in the world, himself, his house, his
horses, his fortune, were hers, to do exactly
what she liked with.

Since Mrs. Lankester had as good as told
him there were no other candidates in the
field, he had begun to think that in time
he could persuade Dot, dear, darling,
plucky little Dot, to care for him as he
cared for her. Only he must not attempt
to hurry her. He had seen the mistake of
being too precipitate. And so he went
home, and sat thinking of his love all the
evening, recalling her looks and words, and

counting the days till the Morbey-Anstead
steeplechases.

That had been a happy thought of his,
taking the Lankesters ; for even if the
doctor could not get away from his
professional duties he felt pretty sure he
might count on Mrs. Lankester. And for
Dot's sake he would have put up with half-a-dozen
stout, elderly mothers, and paid
them assiduous attention, however much
they repelled him secretly.

By which it will be seen how hopelessly
in love he was, and how far this earthly
passion had separated him from his
spiritual affinity in the shape of Lady de
Fochsey.

The fair widow revenged herself by
riding home with Lord Littelbrane, and
gauging that nobleman's psychological
aptitudes, as a consolation for previous
disappointments.

But though she applied various test

conditions, she failed to discover that he
possessed any mediumistic qualities. Not
only was his lordship not magnetic, but
worse still, during a seven mile ride, which
presented numberless openings, he proved
himself to be slow, wanting in dash, and
insufferably commonplace.

As for his theories and prosy platitudes,
she was sick to death of them already.

But for all that, she thought it would
prove a splendid punishment for Mr. Jarrett
if she became Lady Littelbrane, and
honored his existence ever after.
Her ideas were not exactly high in spite
of dear Monsieur Adolphee's tuition.

A FASHIONABLE STEEPLECHASE MEETING.

The Morbe3-Ansteacl steeplecliases had for
many years past been held on a level piece
of ground, the property of Lord Littelbrane,
situated only about three miles distant from
the town of Stiffton, and known by the
name of Stiffton Flats. It was intersected
by a running stream which meandered
through rich, grassy meadows, and which,
during wet weather frequently overflowed
its banks. This brook, slightly widened,
and the take-off side guarded by an artificial
fence, had to be jumped twice by those
horses that took part in the races.

Looked at from the point of view of a
pedestrian, the course was a very fair one.
From first to last it did not present a single

obstacle such as might not be jumped with
hounds every time they ran hard. It was
nearly all grass, and beautifully level, save
for a slight ascent at the finish. Yet those
who knew Stiffton Flats well, and were in
the habit of riding over them year after
year, were unanimous in the opinion that
more horses came to grief there, or else
failed to get round the course, than at
almost anv other hunt meetings in the
kingdom.

Neither was the reason far to find.

Had the Morbey Anstead steeplechases
come ofi* in the spring, or during a period
of drought, no country could possibly have
been more delightful. But who can count
on a cessation of rain during the months of
November and December? It required
only a comparatively small amount of
moisture to render those flat, low-lying
pastures extending on either side of
Skelton brook sticky and holding beyond

conception. After a few sharp showers the
water was wont to lie about in pools in the
furrows, where it was no uncommon thing
for it to remain the greater part of the
winter.

Horses and riders knew from bitter
experience the detaining properties of that
still clay soil ; but to the uninitiated all
seemed fair, flat and green. Sportsmen
from afar laughed at the fences, and
declared emphatically that they would not
mind a bit riding over them themselves ;
but they generally adhered their tone before
the day was over, and they saw how much
grief " was caused by these same innocent-looking
jumps, more especially after the
first two miles were left behind.

Amateur jockeys, busy galloping and
preparing their horses, had prayed for fine
weather for days past ; but as usual it had
been a week of " depressions." Driving rain
and boisterous winds came sweeping across

the Atlantic, until at last the heavy weights,
looking in despair at the sodden state of
the ground, prophesied with melancholy
prescience that they might just as well keep
their horses in their stables, instead of
exposing them to ignominious defeat.

But however bad the weather, not to be
present at the county steeplechases was a
departure from Morbey Anstead manners
and customs, of which no one dreamt
seriously for a second.

In truth, this honos established meetings
was a most popular one with all classes of
society. Invariably fixed to take place on
a non-hunting days, it was patronized not
only by the Mutual Adorationites, but also
by the Quornites, men from the Cottesmore
and the Bel voir, and even by followers of
the more distant Pytchle} Atherton, and
North Warwickshire hunts.

It was in short, a social gathering of
hunting people, who assembled from all

parts of the midland counties. Fashionable

Melton was well represented, and sent forth

numerous well-known members of the

aristocracy, including a foreign prince,

an English duke and a whole host of

minor celebrities. From every country

house within a radius of many miles there

issued beautiful women, big of bust and

small of waist (by the way, how is the

combination produced so frequently on

horseback ?), clad in the tightest of

Horne and Justine habits, the smartest

and most fanciful of vests, and the most

diversified and eccentric of hats. Some

went in for low crowns, some high  very

high, and with a perfectly marvellous

nap. Some wore wide brims, some narrow,

but when stylish, they were nearly always

a few sizes too small for the owner's head,

and were jauntily perched a top of a lovely

blonde or dark france, as the case milites

and then kept on by a cleverly pinned

veil whose black spots lent lustre to the
complexion, making soft cheeks softer and
large eyes larger.

Amongst these fair equestriennes, however,
could be seen specimens of a totally
different type of sportswoman, though it
must be owned that they were in the
minority. The strong-minded ladies, who
hunted their five or six days a week as
regularly as men, were evidently indifferent
to appearances. They could be distinguished
by rusty skirts that had already
done much service, by loosely-flapping
covert coats, opening in front over a horse-cloth
or bird's-eye waistcoat, by worsted
gloves, old roomy boots, tightly-plaited hair
(no fringes) and pot hats.

They went in exclusively for comfort,
not fashion or show ; and if the day turned
out wet, proved their sense ; but on the
other hand, if Phoebus shone brightly
and condescended to liizht up the scene
VOL. III. 39

with his golden rays, then it must be confessed
that they did not appear to advantage
beside their smarter and matter sisters.
As for the lords of creation they displayed
so many marvellous checks that one wondered
at the ingenuity of the human brain
to produce such astonishing combinations.
Tall men wore little checks, and small men
wore big ones  the biggest they could find
and strutted about like bantam cocks,
trying, since nature had been unkind, to
make themselves remarkable by the clothes
on their back. And they certainly succeeded,
looking like miniature chess-boards,
in their Scotch tweeds and heather
mixtures. But as long as the genus homo
was pleased wdtli number one, it did not
much signify, and certainly could not
affect the cynical critic.

Now amongst other institutions, fashion
that powerful yet insipid goddess  had
elected that at the Morbey Anstead steeplechases

it was " the things " to ride, not

drive. Consequently very few vehicles
were to be seen in comparison with other
race-meetings.

JSTot more than a dozen filled the stewards*
inclosure as a rule, and the majority of
these were occupied by elderly ladies,
whose riding days and figures were both
gone, and who amused themselves by
watching through their field-glasses, who
was the strange young man riding with
dear Anna Maria or sweet Susan Jane.

By the younger members of the community,
both male and female, it was
considered " chalk " to drive, though if
questioned as to the reason, it is open to
doubt if anybody could have given one.
As far as seeing the races themselves went,
those occupying elevated box-seats possessed
a decided advantage over their
equestrian brethren.

In the one case, you could sit comforts*



ably with a rug rouncl your legs, your
card in your left hand, and your field-glass
in your right, and take uninterrupted
stock of the company and the proceedings
in general. But in the other, you first had
to contend with a fidgety' horse  why is
even the quietest animal ever foaled fractious
on such occasions ?  then gallop
madly down to the water-jump, by which
you lost the start, then as madly back to
the winning-post, where you arrived just
too late to see the finish, and had not an
idea how the race had been run, or what
had won, until you asked your neighbour,
and he asked somebody else, who in turn
appealed to a third party, when eventually
the desired information mifrht or miizht not
be obtained.

Then you clapped each other on the back
figuratively speaking, of course ; it would
have been vulvar to do so in reality  and
exclaimed, ** Ha, ha, capital race, capital

finish. There's no doubt that riding is the
only way to enjoy a steeplechase. That's
the beauty of this meeting. You see such a
lot."

As a matter of fact, whether you did, or
whether you didn't, signified very little,
when once fashion had dictated that you
were to prance about the course on high-mettled
hacks and display your figure and
your equitation to the public at large. It
was " the thing." What need to analyze
whether you were comfortable or uncomfortable,
at your ease or the reverse ?
There are no such willing slaves as English
people, nor any other race with such
sheep like propensities. If one bondsman
bends his neck to the yoke, then all must
needs do the same.

It is possible that had Bob been
thoroughly acquainted with Stilton Flat
habits, he too would have yielded his independence
and ridden instead of driven to

the races. But being new to the mother
country's ways he ordered out his deceased
uncle's big, roomy omnibus, piled the roof
up with brown, straw - lined hampers
containing cood thinf:s to eat and to

DO O

drink, seated himself inside and drove off
to fetch the Lankesters, without having
the least suspicion how greatly he was
violating Morbey Anstead manners and
customs.

It had several times occurred to our hero
that if only Doctor Lankester would walk
about the course when they arrived, which
with his sporting tastes he was sure to do,
and if only the old lady would elect to
remain within the four sheltering walls of
the omnibus, he and Dot might occupy the
box-seat and have an uncommonly good
time of it. This was how the artful fellow
reasoned.

Just as he started the sun shone out, and
caused patches of clear hie sky to breakup

the heavy masses of dark grey cloud
that ahiiost filled the heavens ; but in spite
of its cheering influence, he did not feel
thoroughly happy until he had made quite
sure of his guests, and Dot, looking very
pretty and pleasant, was seated by his side,
whilst Doctor and Mrs. Lankester occupied
the seat opposite.

The latter lady was magnificently and
carefully attired for the occasion. She
wore a purple silk dress, a Paisley shawl,
and a bonnet which would have put many
a garden to shame, so crowded was it with
gay and many-coloured flowers, mounted
on green india-rubber stalks, which kept
bobbing about with each movement of the
wearer's head. Every time she looked at
Bob and Dot she smiled encouragingly at
them, and in a way which, to the girl at
least, was peculiarly irritating.

She was terrified lest Mr. Jarrett should
discover the meanings of those bland nods

and maternal grimaces, wliicli seemed to
her quite shamefully apparent.

So they drove on, along the country
roads, past villages and homesteads, and
through the flourishing little town of
Stiffton, with its tortuous, old-fashioned
streets, well-to-do inns, prospering shops,
and venerable church, up whose grey walls
the ivy clung, and whose square tower
formed a landmark for miles around. A
clean, bustling little town, full of life and
animation on this particular morning, as
flies rattled past from the railway station,
and huge open conveyances offered to
deposit pedestrians on the course for the
modest sum of fourpence a-head. Before
the hotels paced ready-saddled horses,
waiting for their riders to appear, and
behind each curtained window peeped out
the innocent faces of little children, and
the more curious ones of their mothers or
nurses.

Such was Stiffton. As good a specimen
as you could meet with of a thriving
hunting town. Such sleek, fat tradesmen,
and such innumerable villas nestling on
every height, told a tale of prosperity, rare
in this our nineteenth century.

When Bob's omnibus neared the entry
to the race-course, a little delay occurred,
owing to his not being possessed of an
inclosure ticket. To tell the truth, he had
never given the matter a thought.

But Mrs. Lankester was quite put out
at the discovery. She had set her heart on
being among what she styled ' the nobs."

Do you mean to say, Mr. Jarrett, that
you actually have not got a ticket ? " she
asked with considerable asperity, too bad
an actress to conceal her displeasure.

No," he replied, " I am sorry to say I
have not."

Why on earth did you not ask for
one r

*' For the very simple reason, Mrs.
Lankester, that I did not know who to
ask. Besides," throwing back his head
with an independent gesture, " I hate
becGin for favours."

Quite right," murmured Dot sympathetically.


Pooh ! Where's the favour ? " responded
Mrs. Lankester in a louder key.
In your position you have a right to a
steward's ticket. Captain Straighten always
had one, that I know for a fact."

Very probably, but then he was a
resident in the county, whereas I am a newcomer,
and moreover have had nothing todo
with the races."

You'd better let us in," said Mrs.
Lankester persuasively, trying the effect of
an appeal to the man at the gate. " This is
Mr. Jarrett  Captain Straight em's nephew.
Nobody will say anything, I'm sure."

Anxious to conciliate as far as lav in his

power, the man turned to Lord Littelbrane,
who at this juncture appeared on the
scene, accompanied by General Prosieboy
and another Mutual Adorationite, one
Captain Greenbyby by name.

Before Bob could prevent him, he went
up to the noble proprietor of the course,
doubtless thinking to curry favour with
both parties.

Beg pardon, my lord," he said, touching
his hat respectfully, " but will you
kindly furnish me with instructions ? I am
at a loss how to act."

Why, what's wrong. Perkins ? " returned
his lordship in surprise. " You have
your orders."

Yes, my lord, but I fear there has been
some mistake. It appears that Mr. Jarrett,
of Straighten Court, has not been provided
with an inclosure ticket."

Well, what of that ? Why the dickens
should he be? "

Am I to let him in, or not ? "

No, certainly not," thundered his lordship
in reply. " I'm surprised at you,
Perkins. I should have thought after all
these years you should have known your
business better than to come to me with
such a demand. The Kin: of Enijland
himself should not go inside our county
inclosure without a ticket."

Whereupon he gave his horse an angry
touch of the heel, and moved on.

*the idea!" he exclaimed, turning indignantly
to his companions, " of having
that low fellow in among us. Why it's
enough to put one off one's day's amusement
altogether."

General Prosieboy and Captain Greenbyby
both assented, though the former mumbled
vaguely that lie wondered where the deuce
they were going to get luncheon, and wished
inwardly that Lord Littelbrane had had
the sense to follow Mr. Jarrett's example,

and bring plenty of food, in a comfortable
slit-up trap, rather than depend upon the
hospitality of his neighbours, which might
or might not be forthcoming at the requisite
moment. Meals oucrht not to be trifled
with, in General Prosieboy's estimation.
They were important things, and if you
were docked of one, it was a serious loss.
Had he been quite sure where and with
whom he was going to lunch, he should have
felt easier decidedly in his mind. But he had
a distinct recollection of beim' invited to
refresh his inner-man on a former occasion
bv a noble earl, who offered him nothing
more substantial than a packet of dry
sandwiches, and who folded up the paper
and string when he had finished this light
repast, and then, in order to assuage his
thirst politely tendered him half a glass of
sherry, doled out from a pocket flask.
That luncheon was still green in the
general's memory, and even now gave him

the shudders when he recalled it. The mere
sight of Bob's well-filled leander inflamed
him with (astronomer longings.

But he was far too much of a sycophant
to express his real sentiments, especially
when he felt pretty certain that they would
not meet with a favourable reception, so
resolutely averting his eyes from that highly-laden
omnibus roof, he burst into a forced
laugh and said :

"I wonder what the devil that fellow
Jarrett means by coming to our Morbey
Anstead races in this tinkering style. Surely
he has horses enough in his stable to be
able to pull one out on an occasion like the
present."

Perhaps he thinks a four-wheeled conveyance
safer than pony-back," suggested
Captain Greenbyby, who with stiffly waxed
moustache and squared elbows was riding
a sprightly little hog-maned animal, only a
few sizes Lorimer than a fullgrown donkey.

No, I'll give the man this due. He
ain't afraid," chimed in Lord Littelbrane,
whose sense of justice, though extremely
limited, was strong. " He can't ride one
little bit  rolls about all over the place, and
is nearly off at every fence, but he has got
the pluck of the old gentleman himself."

Pshaw ! He'll soon come back, he'll
soon come back to the level of the rest
of 'em," murmured General Prosieboy disparagingly.
" Nobody ever keeps the ball
a-rollino' for more than a season or two in
this country, and the harder they go at
first, the sooner they collapse as a rule.
Look at ' Crashing Jimmy,' " naming a
well-known member of the hunt ; " the
very sight of a fence settles him nowadays,
and yet what a bruiser he was at one time."

Meantime Bob had succeeded in findini2f
a place for his carriage just outside,
though not within, the magic ropes which
separated the elite of half-a-dozen hunts

from the so-called " outsiders." The
winning-post was not twenty yards off.
The omnibus faced the rails, and as he and
Dot did not trouble themselves much about
social distinctions, and certainly did not
allow them to interfere with their pleasure,
they were perfectly satisfied. Not so Mrs.
Lankester.

As already seen, in coming to the races
under Mr. Jarrett's sheltering wince she had
imagined she should have a place amongst
the regular county people. She had
pictured to herself the delight of being
able to nod triumphantly to her friends
and acquaintances from the superior altitude
of the stewards' inclosure. The
reality was a bitter disappointment, and
she could not refrain from venting her
displeasure upon Bob.

*'Eeally,Mr. Jarrett," she said, speaking in
acrid tones, " I must say that I don't think
you have managed matters at all well."

Bob winced. His mamma-in-law was
beginnings to assert her rij2fhts a little soon.

Indeed, Mrs. Lankester. I am sorry
you should be of such an opinion."

No, not at all well," she continued.
For what's the use of living in a great
big house, and having ever so much money,
if you go and stick yourself down among a
parcel of nobodies, instead of being with
the swells, as you ought to be. 1 call it
downright foolish."

Oh, mamma, don't  please don't,"
gasped Dot piteously, her face suddenly
turning the colour of a peony. " Mr.
Jarrett has been so kind, and surely, surely
it is not for us to find fault. Why, we should
not be here at all were it not for him."

His heart went out towards her. He
would have given anything to kiss her
sweet, eloquent lips.

Never mind, Miss Dot," he said,
looking? at her with a reassuring smile.

VOL. JII. 40

Xo doubt Mrs. Lankester is quite right in
what she says. She must forgive my
blundering for once, and next year, if weare
all alive and well, I hope she may have
the satisfaction of seeing us in the inclosure,
where, according to her opinion, we
()U(ht to be now."

That one little word " us " restored Airs.
Lankester"s good humour as by a miracle.
For, she argued, Mr. Jarrett might so very
easily have said " meT But " us " was comprehensive
and significant in the extreme ;
it meant your daughter and I and a happy
family party. At all events, she would do
all she could to promote the match. So the
cross, dissatisfied expression vanished from
her face, and she said very winningly :

I hope so also. And now, Mr. Jarrett,
don't you think that you and Dot had
better go and have a look at the fences
before the races benin? Doctor Lankester
has been gone some time."

Won't you come, too, mother ? " said
lier daughter, detecting a maternal artifice,
and resenting it accordingly, for had she
not received a long lecture on the advantages
of matrimony previous to starting ?

The green stalks, with their burden of
artificial flowers, waved backwards and
forwards dissenting.

"No, dearest, I am far too afraid of
getting my feet wet."

"Then I'll stop with you, mother."

Oh, dear no ! Never mind me, child.
I'm accustomed to behoof left alone. Mr.
Jarrett, carry her off; but oh. Dot, before
you go, just take one look at old Lady
Fraserburgh's bonnet. Did you ever see
such a thing ? It's not fit for a housemaid.
There is not a single flower or feather upon
it, and they tell me that flowers, especially,
are all the rage nowadays."

Dot and Bob walked off together. The
girl went reluctantly, but she dared not

40*

offer any opposition for fear of rendering
her mother's scheming too apparent.
Nevertheless, in her heart of hearts she
fek bitterly ashamed. It was such a
horrible, humiliating thing for any modest-minded
young woman to be thrown at a
man's head in this barefaced fashion ; and
the more you liked the man, the more you
respected and esteemed him, the worse it
was.

What, too, could be more awful than
having to blush for your own mother ? All
Dot's sense of ladyhood had been already
shocked repeatedly. But to show her distress
in any way was only to make matters
worse. So, with a sobered manner, and
most of her pleasure gone for the day, she
walked b} her companion's side, striving
hard to conceal how greatly she was
vexed and annoyed by Mrs. Lankester's
remarks.

AN AMATEUR FINISH.

A FINE, sympathetic insight seemed to have
revealed to Bob that Mrs. Lankester had
contrived to put Dot out, therefore he
sedulously avoided the subject of the
inclosure ticket, and did all he could to
restore her 'serenity. He behaved very
well indeed, more like an elder brother
than an admirer, and did not attempt to
pay her a single compliment, or to make
one flowery speech.

The girl was grateful, and appreciated
the delicacy of his conduct. As a proof,
she exerted herself to amuse, and, as they
walked down the course, pointed him out
a few of the celebrities she knew by sight,
who, of course, were unknown to Bob.

Do yon see that handsome middle-aged
woman on the black horse ? " she exclaimed,
as a buxom lady of some eight and thirty
summers passed by, laughing and chatting
to her male attendant,

"Yes, who is sheP "

She is Mrs. Lono'-Lamrley, a siren who
is said to have broken more hearts than
any woman in England, and who even now,
though no longer as voun<]f as she was,
contrives to captivate every man she comes

across."

Either the men must be very weak, or
their hearts remarkably brittle," answered
Bob, for, in his present love-lorn condition,
he had eyes but for one. " I don't see anything
in her at all."

Don't sou ? Then you are an exception
to the rule, since her admirers are legion.
The gentleman ridings bv her side  the
stout one, I mean, in the frock coat  is the
Duke of Breezvcourt. It is said that he

would marry Mrs. Long-Langley tomorrow,
if Mr. Long-Langley were out of the
way."

Why, she looks old enough to be his
mother," exclaimed Bob, taking another
look at the captivating equestrian. " I
would as soon fall in lose with my grandmother.
What can constitute the attraction?"


Dot laughed. Even the nicest of women
is not displeased at hearing one of her own
sex disparaged, at least where appearances
are concerned. There is a natural rivalry
amongst them.

You are evidently less susceptible than
the StifFtonians, Mr. Jarrett. But people
who know Mrs. Long-Langley intimately,
declare that she possesses a most wonderfully
fascinating manner. And now I want
you to look at somebody else  somebody
who, personally, I admire infinitely more."

And who might that be ? " inquired

Bob. " T am curious to learn your taste at
any rate."

' Turn to the left, then, and you will see
Lady Norman just coming on the course,
driving a pair of wonderful bay horses.
Make haste, or she will have pulled up.
There ! " as Bob's eyes roved in the desired
direction, *' did you ever see such
steppes . It is a pleasure to watch them
move."

They are magnificent, certainly. But
who is this Lady Norman ? Has she a
history also ? "

Yes, but it is a very sad one. Her
husband is mad  not mad enough to be
shut up, but he does the most extraordinary
things, and takes the funniest fancies into
his head. One is, that he is always falling
in love with actresses and queer sort of
people, which, of course," said Dot innocently,
'' must be very distressing to Lady
Norman. But she behaves like an aniel.

and forgives all his escapades. People say
that she loves lira in spite of everything,
and that her life is miserable in consequence.
Poor thing ! I am sorry for
her."

Bob's interest was aroused. He withdrew
his eyes from the spirited bay horses,
and looked at their driver. He saw an
extremely beautiful, calm, sad face, whose
look of settled melancholy touched his
heart. It was easy, even for a stranger
like himself, to tell that Lady Norman was
far from being a happy woman.

Thus time passed away, and both Dot
and Bob were so interested in all they perceived
going on around them, that they
were quite astonished when the jockeys,
wearing silk caps and jackets, began to
appear in the paddock, and commenced
making preparations for mounting their
respective steeds.

This was a signal that the first race

would shortly be run, therefore the two
young people made the best of their way
back to the omnibus, where they found
Mrs. Lankester still busily inspecting old
Lady Fraserburgh's bonnet, through an
ivory opera-glass grown yellow with age.

"I never was more disappointed in my
life. Dot," she murmured in her daughter's
ear. " I thought to see such a fine show
of bonnets, and really, there ain't one to
compare with mine." Then she profited
by Bob's turning to give a few words of
direction to his man, and added eagerly
how have you been getting on?"
Dot was thankful to escape the necessity of
replying, owing to Mr. Jarrett's suddenly
asking her mother at what time she would
like luncheon, which, fortunately, diverted
her attention.

Won't you come outside, Mrs.
Lankester ? " he inquired, when this
important matter had been settled.

'No, thank you, Mr. Jarrett, I'm afraid
of the cold air. But make Dot go. She
loves to see the races, and to tell the
honest truth, I don't much care about
them one way or the other."

Dot was rapidly gaining confidence iu
Bob ; his conduct was so delicate ; besides,
she began to feel that she would rather be
alone with him any number of hours than
sit and listen to her mother's speeches ;
they were so very, very trying, and irritated
her so fearfully.

Both pride and shame were roused by
turns. Therefore she scrambled up onto
the box seat, and Bob seated himself
by her side, but before many minutes
had passed Dr. Lankester joined them,
puffing a little, from the pace at which
he had walked. " They are making
Albatross favourite," he said, " but the
course is awfully heavy, and, in my
opinion, he won't stay home when the

pinch comes. He's too slack in the loins
for my taste."

What do you fancy, papa ? " asked
Dot. " You generally manage to select
the winners."

*' Well, I've sot a sneaking liking? for

O DO

Dauntless. He may not show quite so
much quality as Albatross, but for all that
he's a real good stamp of hunter and the
public have had the sense to make him
second favourite."

*' Have you backed him, doctor?'
inquired Bob, who had not cared to leave
his companion in order to visit the betting
ring. Moments spent alone with Dot were
far too precious to be thus wasted.

Only for five shillings, just to give mea
little interest in the race. I never invest
large sums. Firstly, because I can't afford
it, and secondly, because one's bound to
lose in the long run."

As he finished speaking, the six competitors

who were to take part in the race
came trotting down the course and went
some two or three hundred yards. Then,
turning sharp round, they cantered back
again at half speed, the bright jackets of
the jockeys flashing past like meteors, and
for a second bewildering the eye. Even to
the uninitiated, it was clear that Captain
Greenbyby's Albatross was the gentleman of
the party. But he was an aged horse, and
carried the top weight, having, in years
past, won over the very same course, inconsequence
of which he had to put up
with a penalty of seven pounds. A horse
might be ever so good, and yet fail to
catch the judge's eye with twelve stone
thirteen on his back, especially when the
going " was as bad as to-day. The
hypercritical, too, took exception to
Albatross's feet, which were remarkably
small and almost asinine in conformation,
whereas Dauntless's broad hoofs seemed

more calculated to cope with the mud and
the clay. lie was of a bigger, stouter make
altogether, aud, being only five years of
age, his impost was but eleven stone twelve.
Thus there was exactly fifteen pounds
difference between the two horses ; a
difference which many of the knowing ones
thought fatal.

But Captain Greenbyby, who rode Albatross
himself, was extremely confident of
winning, and advised all his friends to
back his mount, in spite of the gallant
grey having to carry lumps of weight in
comparison with every other animal in the
race. Mayfly, Sir Roger, Gamecock and
Kildare were youngsters, who had yet to
wain their laurels between the flags. Kildare,
in particular, came with a high
reputation from over the water, and was
a son of Solon on the sire's side, and of
old Camilla on the dam's. But beyond
that he had been seen to give his owner

a couple of nasty rolls oat liuntirig, when
first lie appeared at covert side, nothing
much was known of him. Still, he had
the makers of a f'ood horse.

At length the Hag was dropped to an
excellent start, and the six competitors all
cleared the first fence in beautiful order,
skimming' over it without touching twi.
It was a pretty sight to see one after the
other take off exactly right, and land as
lightly as a cat. Neither did the second
obstacle produce " grief." On streamed
the noble animals, until they neared the
water-jump, which, although of no very
formidable dimensions, caused Mayfly to
refuse.

She whipped round so sharply that her
jockey was within an ace of flying over
her head, an action which he greatly resented.
Aijfain and ai'ain he drove her at
the brook with a vigour and a persistence
both highly creditable, but nevertheless,

quite ineffectual. Mayfly laid back her
ears, and swerved before she came within
yards of that obnoxious streamlet.

The spectators, meantime, had been so
much interested by the contest going on
between man and horse, that they had
almost forgotten the race itself, especially
as the five remaining horses had disappeared
into the distant country.

When they again could be seen the pace
and the heavy ground were already telling
their tale. Only Dauntless, Albatross and
Gamecock remained to the fore. Kildare
had either fallen, or else been pulled up,
when his rider perceived that his chance
was hopeless, and Sir Eager, though he
still plodded wearily on in the rear, was
almost half a field behind the leaders,
whose girths he stood but little chance of
reaching, unless all three failed to keep
upright.

A hundred yards more and it became

evident that Gamecock's bolt was shot,
and that the issue lay between the two
favourites, Albatross and Dauntless. The
former struggled nobly under his heavy
impost, but both horses were dead beat,
and there seemed little, if anything, to
choose between them. And now a most
singular scene took place, and one such as
might not be witnessed in a lifetime ;
in fact, it required to be see?i to be
believed.

On, on they came with heavy labouring
stride. Dauntless was first on to the racecourse.
But he was so done, that after
brushing through the last fence, he stood
stock still for a few seconds on landing.
This conduct on his part enabled Albatross
to gain an advantage.

But he, in his turn, was equally exhausted,
and he could hardly raise a canter.
Mad with emulation and disappointment,
the rider of Dauntless, by whip and spur,

VOL. III. 41

set him going afraid. That brief halt, short
as it was, had enabled the poor horse to
get a whiff of fresh air. It served him in
good stead now, and probably turned the
balance in his favour. He began to makeup
for lost ground.

Albatross's jockey made a vigorous call.
Then he committed that great mistake of
nine amateur riders out of ten, and
attempted to use his whip. As he raised
his hand aloft, the horse stopped to nothing,
and within half-a-dozen strides of the
winning post Dauntless overhauled his
opponent, and by a desperate effort
manacled to secure the audire's fiat bv a
short neck.

Two seconds afterwards, and both horses
relapsed voluntarily into a walk, and from
a walk to a stand. Even when they had
sufficiently recovered to move leisurely
towards the paddock, a veritable cloud of
steam enveloped them, which issued from

their nostrils in spasmodic streams, and
robbed the precious air of half its freshness.
Great drops of perspiration rolled
down from their foreheads to the ground,
and their outstretched necks and heaving
flanks warned those who were destined to
follow in their footsteps what they might
expect. Albatross had run a good game
horse, and though beaten be was not disgraced
; but dien his master dismounted,
he asked himself somewhat ruefully,
whether the race repaid him for having
taken so much out of his mount, and
whether he might not just have won it had
some kind freak of fortune deprived him of
his whip.

Meantime, so great had been the excitement
occasioned by this uncommon finale, that
nobody paid much attention to the weather.
But that vast host of smart gentlemen and
ladies on horseback were all at once disagreeably
forced to take it into their cont*



iteration. The sky became overcast, the
sun vhich had shone fitfully throughout
the morning  disappeared sullenly behind
a spreading mass of leaden cloud, and
presently a few great drops of rain caused
the wary to cast an anxious eye around in
search of shelter. The wind, too, arose,
and whistled and howled through the
hedge-rows and the tops of the trees, until it
sounded like angry waves dashing themselves
against the sea-shore, and then receding
with a baffled roar.

As previously mentioned, the truly
fashionable throng had come to the races
in gala array, determined to spend a long
and happy day, and had no convenient
carriages to retire to in case of an emergency
like the present. Darker and darker
grew the clouds, until at last down came
the rain with merciless severity. There is
rain and rain. A mild steady dribble is
nothing when contrasted with a chilly

torrent, that cuts the very skin on your
cheeks and freezes the marrow in your
bones.

The rain which now descended was of
this latter character  fierce, cold, penetrating
to a degree. Horses refused to face
it, and turning round with one accord,
stood with their backs to the bitter wind,
presenting a row of trembling quarters and
tucked-in tails.

In five minutes every one was more or
less wet through. Even treble Melton
could not stand it. The ladies conducted
themselves bravely, as they always do on
such occasions, but all the same they looked
thoroughly unhappy in their light and
saturated habits, which outlined each fair
form with the clinging austerity of a
bathing-gown.

Those people who are in the habit of
patronizing local meetings, where covered
stands are all but unknown, and carriages

or tents offer the only refuge in bad
weather, will appreciate the difference produced
in a few minutes by sunshine or
storm. On Stilton Flats, one short quarter
of an hour ago, all was bright and gay.
The ladies and gentlemen on horseback, in
their smart clothes and glossy hats, galloped
briskly up and down, and lent animation
to the scene. Gipsy women prowled
from carriage to carriage, and made themselves
generally objectionable, red-coated
runners, accustomed to hunt on foot with
the various packs, strove to gain a few
honest pence by selling race-cards, negroes
sang, acrobats tumbled, Aunt Sally and the
three-card trick drove a lively trade,
oranges and cocoanut were freely disposed
of, as also were sticks of coloured rock and
gingerbread nuts. Bookmakers shouted
out the odds until they were hoarse,
jockeys enveloped in covert coats, with
their silk caps looking like bright dots in

the crowd, wound their way through the
multitude, and in the paddock, dainty,
sleek-coated horses walked leisurely around,
or else lashed out impatiently at their too
ardent admirers, until they forced them to
keep at a respectable distance from their
nimble heels.

All was life, bustle, movement and good-humour.


Now, a ghastly change had come over
the scene. One could hardly realize it was
the same. The racecourse was black with
dripping umbrellas, that resembled so many
overgrown mushrooms turned mouldy by
decay. What carriages there were where
mostly open, and presented a similar spectacle,
slightly diversified by waterproof
rugs ; whilst as for the aristocratic throng
on horseback  the flower of half-a-dozen
hunting fields  the male and female
masters " of Stilton and all the surrounding
country, if ever people looked

thoroughly wretched, miserable and uncomfortable,
they did. The rain had taken
all the pride out of them. Their glory had
departed, at all events for that day ; and
they stood revealed as mere ordinary
human beings, neither better nor worse
than their neighbours, when shorn of all
the pomp and majesty of purple and fine
linen. Even a Stifftonian cannot rise
superior to crumpled collars and a limp
shirt front. Our washerwoman has a great
deal to do with producing the semblance of
a gentleman.

- cs ses r"==

I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE TO SERVE YOU."

To make matters worse, the rain came on
exactly at two o'clock, when an hour had
been allowed between the first and second
races for luncheon. Everyone felt more
or less hungry. But how were folk to eat,
drink and make merry when it was pouring
down in buckets, sending horrible, cold
driblets from the brim of your hat along
your spine, reducing your linen to a pulp
and coursing from the tip of your nose like
a water-spout ?

A few wise people galloped ofl home
without more ado, but the majority, having
arranged for a day's pleasuring, were
obliged to wait until the bitter end. Trains

ran inconveniently, and specials were not
to be obtained until quite late in the
afternoon, when all the fun was supposed
to be over. But what fun ? The good-natured
and cheerful optimist, though ill at
ease bodily, prognosticated that the weather
was sure to mend shortly, since it was quite
too bad to last. The pessimist growled
back in reply, that he didn't care a hang
whether it did or whether it didn't, .since
he was wet through already and could not
possibly be in a worse plight.

In short, folk were full of compassion for
themselves ; so full, that they had little to
spare for the poor horses, who cowered and
winced before the fierce blast in a truly
pitiable manner, their glossy coats stained
dark by the wet, which trickled down inlarge
drops from every part.

While all this was ioincf on without,
many were the envious glances cast at
that snug little quartette seated comfortably

inside Mr. Jarrett's capacious omnibus, discussing
a whole row of good things spread
out appetizingly on the cushions. Even
Mrs. Lankester's attention was completely
diverted for the time bein!: from her
neighbour's bonnet to Bob's champagne,
which she appeared highly to relish,
judging from the number of times she
plied her glass and allowed it to be
filled without remonstrance. The strings
of her tongue became gradually unloosened,
and her company manners were
laid aside.

Now, I call this jolly ! " she exclaimed,
smacking her fat lips, and smiling unctuously
at Bob. Eh ? What do you say, Mr.
Jarrett ? though I needn't ask, for you
and that girl of mine look as happy as
sand-boys."

Dot almost hid her face in her plate. But
Bob could see her little pink ear grow
pinker and felt for her distress. He foresaw

that his mother-in-law was likely to prove a
thorn in the flesh.

"Thank you, Mrs. Lankester," he rejoined
composedly. "I'm pretty comfortable.
One always does feel better when
one has had something to eat and drink."

"Just so, just so. Your champagne is
capital for keeping out the cold. That's
why I'm taking a little extra."

"Have a drop more, then," and Bob
poured out another bumper.

Mrs. Lankester sipped it with relish.

Lor ! how miserable the swells look ! "
she ejaculated triumphantly, giving a
coarse laucfh of content as the Duke of
Breezycourt and Mrs. Long-Langley rode
by, wearing much the same appearance as
if they had stood under a pump and been
well soused.

I wish I could take them all in," said
kind-hearted Bob. " I feel so sorry for the
poor ladies."

"I'm very glad you can't, Mr. Jarrett.
They would not let us into their inclosure
when we wanted, and now we score over
them. That's as it should be."

''I should not like to have you for an
enemy, Mrs. Lankester."

"Oh! no fear, you never will. On the
contrary," looking significantly at Dot, '* I
am in hopes that we may be the best
friends later on. By-the-way, do yoa
admire Mrs. Long-Langley ? "

"No, not particularly. She has the
remains of a fine woman, but art has been
too evidently employed to preserve them."

That's just what I say. I can't see any
beauty in her whatever."

You forget, my dear," interposed Doctor
Lankester with his genial smile, " that
good looks are apt to be effaced when
exposed to such a downpour. Where is
the carmine of those lovely cheeks ? Where
the straight and pencilled brow, the ruddy

lip and golden locks ? Faded and gone, or
if not quite gone, at all events converted
into little coloured rivulets that scarcely
heighten the general appearance."

Bob laughed heartily.

Why, doctor ! " he exclaimed in a
bantering tone, " I had no idea you were
so cynical."

If there is one thincj on the face of the
earth I detest, it is a painted woman. She
is such a horrid, vile, false sham."

There I am with you," answered Bob.
Try a glass of that claret. I can recommend
it as being something extra good ; ordo
you prefer port ? "

Whilst they were doing full justice to
the viands spread out before them, and
waxing merrier and more colloquial as the
bottles grew empty. Bob suddenly saw a
sight which roused him to compassion.

With their backs turned towards the
quarter from whence the wind came, and

almost facing the omnibus, he spied Lord
Littelbrane and General Prosieboy standing
in dismal silence side by side.

Who can describe the wretched appearance
presented by these two unfortunate
gentlemen, but more especially by the
elder one, who, owing to his advanced
years, was highly susceptible to the cold
and the wet. With collar turned up, hat
crammed down, shoulders shrugged, and
head bent forward on his chest, his venerable
beard transformed into a variety of
little water-spouts which coursed down his
clothes, and with his red old face positively
purple from exposure, there sat General
Prosieboy  a miserable object indeed. Bob's
kind heart melted on the spot. He was not
one to harbour malice, and he forgot that
this man was his enemy, and had insulted
him in every possible way. He remembered
only that he was a human being, past the
prime of life, and at the present moment

evidently suffered from keen physical discomfort.
" Do as thou wouldst be done
by." This was what flashed through his
mind.

In an instant he had left the omnibus,
and was battling his way through the
driving rain and slipping about on the
saturated soil as he vainly strove to make
haste.

"Get off! get off!" he said hurriedly.
'* You must be simply perished. Come into
my 'bus and have a bit of something to eat
and a glass or two of liquor to warm you
up. Here, my man," addressing a half-starved
looking individual, who stood
prowling about, evidently in search of a
job, " hold this gentleman's horse."

Oh, what a heavenly invitation !

For an instant the general thought it was
an angel's voice sounding so sweetly in his
ears. The next, he looked round and saw
the man he had called a duffer and an outsider,

a rank bounder, and every vituperative
name in his vocabulary standing close
beside him, gazing up into his face with a
pair of compassionate brown eyes, so clear
and honest that they seemed as if they
knew no guile.

To do General Prosieboy justice, as their
glances met he felt thoroughly ashamed of
himself. Here was an enemy prepared to
heap coals of fire upon his head. He
positively yearned to accept Bob's timely
and hospitable offer, but if he did so the
sacrifice would be immense, for how could
he continue to abuse him hereafter ? Even
he, was not quite mean enough for that.

But he was scarcely a free agent. If he
followed his inclinations and profited by
Mr. Jarrett's invitation, what would Lord
Littelbrane say ? There lay the difficulty,
which was greatly increased by his companion's
presence. Should he be upbraided
and condemned as a base seceder from the
VOL. III. 42

ranks of the Mutual Adorationites ?
Would he be branded as a traitor to his
order, a turncoat and a renegade ?

He glanced uneasily at his lordship, who
maintained an impenetrable front, and
whose countenance was as impassive as a
mask. He could "clean nothing from its
stolidly frigid expression.

Just then a furious gust of wind and rain
combined, almost carried their horses off
their legs, and caused them to sidle up

against the coach of the Lancers, a

regiment whose existence Lord Littelbrane
had seen fit to honore, and had never calledon.
A regular rivulet ran off the roof,
and almost swamped the unhappy horsemen.


Abject and pitiful as might be General
Prosieboy's conduct, the bodily discomfort
which he was enduring conquered every
remaining vestige of pride. H the Devil
himself had made him a similar oiler he

would have accepted it at that moment,
when the horrid moisture penetrated to his
neck, his back, his thighs, and sent icy
shivers, suggestive of rheumatism, sciatica
and lumbago, through all his substantial
frame.

Thank you," he said to Bob, dismounting
as speedily as his wet clothes
would permit of. "It has turned out a
most miserable day, and I shall be glad to
avail myself of your hospitality."

That's right," exclaimed the younger
man cordially. Then in a lower tone he
added, " Won't his lordship come also ?
It is so very stormy and disagreeable."

Lord Littelbrane overheard the remark,
but he, at least, was consistent. In his
heart of hearts he despised his friend's
weakness, and felt secretly angered by it
No amount of wet or cold should succeed
in making Item depart from his principles.
Corporeal misery should not induce Idm to

42*

quit his colours. He would stick to them
through thick and thin, and at all events
show a good example to this unworthy and
degenerate M.A.

No, thank you," he said in his most
lordly and stiffest manner ; " I'm not so
susceptible to a little rain as General
Prosieboy, and prefer to remain where I
am."

Then he looked at the dripping and
trembling old man with a contempt which
he did not attempt to conceal, and muttered
in an ill-pleased undertone, " I'm surprised
at you, Squasher ! "

It needed a creat many glasses of Bob's
champagne, supplemented b} a tumbler of
stiff brandy and water, to restore that
distinguished warrior's equanimity. He
felt depressed and degraded, and if it had
not been for the drink, which was uncommonly
cooil, and served without any
stint, he never could have survived so

crushing a reprimand from the head of the
Mutual Adorationites

But little by little, as he grew more
comfortable, his dignity returned. The
generous wine flowed through his veins,
and chased away that disagreeable sensation
of whipped hound. After all, a man might
take a little luncheon with a fellow on
emergency without being obliged to have
much to do with him hereafter. The
fellow might be dropped directly he was
no longer useful, and put back into his
place gently but firmly. It only required
tact.

The general was a fine old man. In his
cups he was apt to grow pompous, and he
so far conducted himself as a M. A. that in
spite of the temptations by which he was
assailed," he never once condescended either
to slap his host on the back, dig him in the
ribs, or even to call him Jarrett, much less
Bob. In fact, he addressed him as seldom

as possible, and when he did, it was always
from the heights of his own superiority.
Isis manner was both patronizing and
offensive. The truth was, he was afraid to
unbend for fear of incurring: Lord Littel-brave's
displeasure, and so fell between two
stools, and conciliated neither his enemy
nor his friend. Both despised him, and
worse still, he despised himself, and was
painfully conscious of the fact.

He sat there, eating away at Bob's
pigeon pie and pate che foie gras, and
swallowing inconceivable quantities of his
Grand Monopoly and Chateau Lafitte, but
he did not make the least effort to render
any return in the way of politeness or
conversation. As for the ladies they came
in for little favour. But then, the Mutual
Adorationites never did say much, even
among' themselves. It was not their
wav. No How of small talk was at their
command, and they kept the few ideas

they possessed far very rare and special
occasions, such as when Mr. 
rode over a hound, or the hunt
subscriptions failed to realize the accustomed
fissure.

\ell," exclaimed Dot, when at last,
the rain having almost ceased, General
Prosieboy rode off to catch his train, after
having first mumbled some very ungraceful
and incoherent thanks, " it's not for me
to abuse your guests, Mr. Jarrett, but of all
the odious, stuck-up, disagreeable old gentlemen
I ever met, I really think General
Prosieboy is entitled to the prize."

I think so too," said Bob soberly ; " I
can't make him out at all."

He was more vexed than he chose to
admit at finding every effort of friendship
on his part so steadily and rudely repulsed.
Por although the general had accepted his
hospitality, and broken bread, so to speak,
at his table, he knew quite well that he had

only done so under pressure, and remained
as much his enemy as heretofore. This
was discouraging in the extreme.

'' I'm afraid there must be something
altogether wronor about me," he said almost
tearfully to Dot, directly they found themselves
together again " Something wholly
unlike other people."

Why, Mr. Jarrett ? What on earth do
you mean ? "

I don't feet on at all. Xot one bit.
Nobody seems to like me, try what I will,"
he returned despondently.

"Don't say that. It is not true."

I wish it were as you say. But even
you. Miss Dot, only tolerate me."

No such thing, Mr. Jarrett. You are
quite mistaken there."

Ah ! I know better. You don't care
for me as I care for you."

She blushed and remained silent. Her
heart told her the accusation was true.

"I wish you would tell me where I
fail," he went on, after a slight pause.
Because then "  and his voice trembled
"I might try and improve."

She felt dreadfully sorry for him, and yet
was afraid to show her sorrow too plainly,
for fear of setting fire to a volcano. His
manner, more than his words, revealed how
deeply he was moved.

"Nonsense," she said firmly. "It's
those nasty, narrow-minded, empty-headed
people who want improving, not you.
Why," and her soft face kindled into
sudden enthusiasm, " you are worth the
whole lot of them put together. I should
like to know how long it would have been
before Lord Littelbrane or General Proxies
asked you to come in out of the
rain, supposing the conditions of to-day
reversed. Don't vex yourself about what
such people say and do, Mr. Jarrett. They
do not deserve a thought, and are simply

beneath you in every way. You are a king
in comparison."

It vas not often Dot spoke at such
length, or with so much earnestness. But
she Alas indignant at the treatment Bob
had received.

And if anything could have comforted
him, her speech did. He turned two moist
and grateful eyes full upon her.

God bless you. Miss Dot'' he said
huskily. " I'm all right again now, for as
lone as you don't consider me a brute I don't
care two straws what anybody else thinks."

I  I like you awfully and so does
papa," she cried impulsively, carried out of
her reserve, and trvinuf only to console him
for the slights he had received.

His face flamed into colour. His whole
soul seemed for one second to Ihisli through
his eyes.

And I like you too. You know that
I do. I would give my life to serve you."

They were simple words, but the way in
which he said them made the blood rush to
her heart in a guilty wave. How was she
ever to make him understand the difference
between loins and liking?, without wounding
his kindly spirit ? " He ought to know
he ouo'ht to know." That was what she
kept telling herself during the homeward
drive.

BOB RECEIVES A SEVERE SHOCK.

A MONTH passed away, and at the end of it
Bob was painfully conscious of the fact
that, in spite of the increased intimacy
existing between himself and the Lankester
family, he had made but little real progress
in his suit.

He and Dot were very good friends, but
nothing more. He never could get any
further. She was always pleasant, and
when they met, which he contrived should
be often, appeared pleased to see him ; and
yet, whenever he made the slightest endeavour
to approach the subject lying so
near his heart, and consuming it with
anxiety, she invariably managed to evade

it, and to turn the conversation into a
totally different channel.

It was vexing in the extreme to find that
directly he touched upon sentiment she
drew in her horns at once, like a sensitive
snail desiring to escape hurt. Hard as he
had tried, every day rendered it more
evident that he had completely failed to
reach Dot's heart. And fully realizing
this, he grew both depressed and discouraged,
and asked himself a thousand
times what was the reason of his unsuccess.
Another thing puzzled him. As the weeks
passed away he began to notice a difference
in Dot. Unfortunately it was not one to
inspire fresh hope, but it kept his mind ina
state of tension.

She gradually lost the sweet serenity and

gentle cheerfulness which had hitherto

been her chief characteristics. The quiet

monotony of her life no longer seemed to

satisfy her. She was often grave and preoccupied.

When in repose, the little,
sweet, babyish face would assume quite a
serious expression. Something appeared
to trouble the girl, and once or twice Bob
fancied that this trouble originated from
her not being altogether happy in her
home.

Now that he had seen more of Mrs.
Lankester, and his first impressions instead
of growing weaker had only become
confirmed, he did not wonder at such
being the case.

Mother and daughter were so unlike.
The one so coarse and narrow minded, the
other such a perfect little lady in every
thought and feeling.

He made various essays to induce Dot
to confide in him, but this she steadily
refused to do. Still, although she never
made any complaint, or acknowledged she
had cause for unhappiness, he contrived
to father that her mother was trvimx to

force her into some course of action against
which her whole nature revolted. As to
what it might be he could only make
vague guesses, and torture himself in the
process. He had a kind of an idea that
Dot did not like him, and that Mrs.
Lankester wanted to make her marry him
against her will. The mere notion rendered
him sad, and yet he could not help thinking
that there was a good deal of truth in it.
Such a supposition, if correct, would quite
account for Dot's reserve. The greater
the pressure put upon her the more
natural her coldness and gravity, and good
God ! just to think of the girl he cared for,
the girl he loved to distraction and almost
idolised, being pestered into giving a lukewarm
consent to their marriage ! Deeply
as his affections were involved, he would
rather bid her good-bye for ever than feel
that she was being rendered miserable
through his instrumentality, and being

goaded to commit a sin from which her
pure, innocent soul shrank back in horror.
Dot's ejes were clear as mirrors. It was
a delight to look deep into their transparent
depths. But would it not be a
pain rather than a pleasure to see them
cloud over at his approach ; exquisite
agony to feel his embraces passively
endured, instead of returned ? Bob's poor
hungry heart clamoured for reciprocity.
Toleration alone could not satisfy it.
Here, alone in a foreign country, far from
his kith and kin, with expectations disappointed
and illusions crumbling one by one
to the ground, he yearned for sympathised
companionship with an aching, insatiable
yearning, which seemed to eat into the
very vitals of his being.

No doubt the weather was in great
measure responsible for the settled gloom
that was gradually stealing upon him and
rendering his spirit weary and joyless.

Since the end of November, protracted
frost had interfered sadly with hunting
arrangements. Frost, accompanied by a
bright sun overhead, and a clear, if cold
blue sky, acts as an invigorating tonic
both to mind and body, but frost ushered
in with a low grey haze, settling weird-like
on the ice-bound earth, and occasionally
diversified by cruel winds and sleeting
snow, produces an exactly opposite effect,
and runs the human barometer down to
zero. At such seasons all the world is apt
to look dark and drear. Nature varies
and man varies with her. He sympathizes
with her sombre moods, rejoices in her
bright, sunshiny ones.

Neither was Bob's health good at this
time. It, like his spirits, had succumbed
to climatic influences, though he would
have scorned to admit the fact, considering
it, like all strong, young and healthy mena
derogatory one. But the cough, con-vol.
III. 43

traced when lie had tumbled into the
brook, had now become chronic, and
although he made liiht of it, and refused
to take any precautions against the
treacherous English climate to which he
was not accustomed, it nevertheless had a
debilitating effect upon his general system.

He lonfTed to set out hunting afain, if
only as a means of diverting his thoughts
from Dot, whose image was continually
present in his mind, and prevented him
from sleeping at night. In short, he lived
in a state of fever; but the self-control
exercised till the present time was too great
to be continued. He felt a crisis was at
hand, and that before long, whether his
cause were hopeless or the reverse, he must
speak out, and have an answer one way or
the other. It was better to know one's
fate than let one's manhood waste away in
torturing suspense. Matters stood thus,
when the hated and detested frost at last

began to show symptoms of giving. First
it rained, and the drops froze as they fell,
then it snowed, then rained again ; a cold,
miserable downpour ; but though the thaw
was a very half-hearted one, it restored to
the roads their normal amount of mud, and
roused hope in the breasts of fox-hunters,
who came scurrying down from town in
hot haste, or else forsook " rockets " and
rabbits with scant ceremony. But disappointment
awaited these eager Nimrodss.
A fiat came forth from the kennels, which,
although perfectly just in itself, created as
much grumbling as such fiats always do 
to the effect that another day must elapse
before the ground would be in a fit state to
admit of pursuing the fox.

When Bob was informed of Lord Littel-brave's
decision, he resolved to run up to
London, having certain business matters
connected with the estate to attend to. On
reaching the station, he found that a train

43*

leaving the metropolis at an early hour had
just arrived. Having some little time to
wait, he began walking up and down the
platform, when, to his great surprise, he
suddenly perceived Dot Lankester, clad ina
neat striped petticoat, a well-fitting black
jacket, and a small felt hat with a red wing.

His heart gave a big leap and went
thump against his side. He was on the
point of going up to speak to her, when he
received an unpleasant shock, which seemed
to bring his whole internal mechanism to a
stand-still. And yet, the sight that disturbed
him so much was a very simple one,
and b}" no means calculated to upset his
equanimity so entirely

He saw a tall, well-built young man, with
a fresh complexion and fair hair, jump out
from a third-class compartment, and he
heard Dot utter a sudden exclamation of
delight, which caused the blood to mantle
in her cheek.

That was all ; but then, impelled by an
overpowering curiosity, he advanced a few
steps, and saw something more  something
that he would have given the whole world
not to have seen.

That tall young man  impudent, ill-mannered
fellow  after a slight and embarrassed
hesitation, stooped down and
actually kissed Dot's upturned face with
an air of horribly familiar proprietorship.

You got my letter, I suppose," he said
interrogatively. " But I need not ask."

Oh ! yes. Will," she replied, her eyes
bright with a liojht that Bob had never
seen there before, and which did away with
any doubts he might have entertained as
to their owner's coldness of disposition.
That is whv I am here."

"I thought you would come to meet me,
when you knew I was passing through."

Naturally ; but oh ! Will, I feel so
wicked."

Wicked ! Pooh ! nonsense ! " he said
shortly. " What's there to feel wicked
about ? "

Mother does not know Tve gone to see

you."

He made a wry face, and Bob, looking
on, instinctively distrusted this young man,
whose manner appeared to him to be forced
and unnatural.

No, I suppose not. But, I say. Dot,
let's come into the waiting-room. It's
jollier there than here. My train does not
go on for another quarter of an hour, and,"
with a sudden flush, " I've ever so much to
tell you ; something that j'ou are bound
to know sooner or later."

What is it, Will? " she asked, alarmed
by the gravity of his tone. " If it's bad
news, don't be afraid to tell me. I'll try
and bear it."

And with that, she slipped her hand
through his arm in quite a lover-like

manner, and looked up into this face, with
oh ! such a smile, and Bob, watching the
proceedings with absorbing interest, felt a
sharp pain shoot through his heart, just as
if it had been stabbed by a knife. Ah !
the agony of that moment, and the revelation
it brought.

He slunk away with an icy, sick sensation
stealing all over his frame, and catching
at the very breath in his lungs, as it
sought to force an exit. His brow was
damp, his legs trembled beneath him.
What did it mean ? Was he mad, or
dreaming some horrible dream I Will,
Will  how he hated the name ! who was
Will ? this man Dot came to meet at a
public railway station, and dio greeted
her with such strange familiarity. He had
known the Lankesters now for some time,
but he had never once heard his name
mentioned. Of that he was positive. He
mifht be Dot's brother. For a moment

Bob breathed again. But no, if this were
so, surely she would have spoken of him
just as she spoke of Matilda, and of
Matilda's children. And if he were not
her brother ? A mist rose before his eves.
He clutched at a column to steady himself.
The world seemed so curiously unreal, so
hazy and strange.

Then a sudden thought flashed across his
mind with the vividness of certain death.
Mii]fht it not be, that Mrs. Lankester had
deceived him when talking about her
daughter, and he had made a cruel mistake
from the very beginning ?

Yes, yes, he knew it was so, and yet he
stru<:cled a,ainst the belief. He thrust it
from him fiercely, vehemently, with the
energy of despair. But in vain. The conviction
grew and strengthened, and refused
to be banished.

All the time the train in which he was
seated kept gliding through quiet green

fields dotted with resting sheep and
browsing cattle, whilst it whirled past
snug homesteads, nestling amongst yellow
corn-ricks, and swept by picturesque
villages, with red chimneys clustering
round some tall grey steeple, the miserable
young man kept saying to himself :

Now everything is explained. This
was Dot's secret  the cause of her coldness
and reserve. She was head over ears in
love with somebody else before ever I
crossed her path."

And then, in his anguish and his despair,
he ground his teeth with impotent passion,
and the veins on his forehead swelled till
they stood out like whip-cord, whilst the
storm within him raged strong.

Oh ! the misery, the mockery of life !
Was it for this that he had come to
England ? Just to get a brief glimpse of
happiness, and then to lose it for ever, and
realize that the highest good vouchsafed toman

on earth was denied him ? Oli ! it was
cruel, cruel.

Why had they not told him at once,
before he had grown to love her with such
power and intensity ? The disappointment
would have been comparatively slight.
Why had not those who knew how matters
stood warned him in time, and so prevented
the mischiefs This deadly hurt
might have been spared him. A little
frankness and foresight would have
averted the evil. But no doubt it was
nothings to them  and he laughed a bitter
laugh  nothing to anybody if he fell desperately
in love with a girl who was
already another man's property. They
would only sneer, and say he was a fool for
not uniting out how the land lay sooner.

He did not blame Dot. No unkind
thought crossed his mind in connection
with her. He exonerated her entirely.
She had done all that modest maiden could

do. Looking back, lie saw now quite
clearly how from their very first meeting
she had discouraged an} symptom of sentiment,
and steadily repressed all display of
tender feeling



But her father ! her mother ! Aye, her
mother !

Mrs. Lankester was the one who had
thrown dust in his eyes, who had egged
him on by every means in her power, and
who, he felt convinced, was bent on
securing? him as a husband for her
daughter. She had purposely practised
concealment. He was as sure of it as he
was of his own existence. So he raved all
the way up to town. But after awhile his
passion spent itself. It left him shaken to
the innermost depths of his being, but
calmer, juster. He even tried to argue
against the evidence of his own senses.

After all, it was just possible he might
be mistaken. Perhaps Will was a cousin.

Girls were often very fond of their cousins
in an innocent, confiding vSij. But no,
Dot's look of ineffable content destroyed
the supposition. No girl could look at a
man like that unless she were thoroughly
in love with him. It was useless trying to
explain away facts just because they had
dealt a death-blow to his hopes.

There was not much to be done under
the circumstances. But one thing he could
do ; namely  know the worst. He would
keep silence no longer. The passion that
consumed his heart should find an outlet
once, even if it must remain mute ever
after. Thus he resolved.

But it would be too late to see Dot that
evenings on his return from town. The
anguish must be endured for yet a few
hours more. On the next days at the
earliest possible hour, he would seek an
interview.

Then, on a sudden, he remembered with

a species of grim satisfaction, that Mrs.
Lankester was confined to her room by
rheumatism. He should see Dot alone,
thank God ! and he knew her well enough
to feel convinced that from her lips, if not
from her mother's, he should hear
nothing but the truth. Dot's statements
could be absolutely relied upon. She
would not deceive him.

Bob spent a restless, wakeful, and miserable
night. Sleep obstinately refused to
visit his tired eyelids. Coloured lights,
kaleidoscopic in shape and variety, danced
beneath them, and still further fatigued his
tired brain. His cough harassed him, and
rendered him hot and feverish. Thought,
that horrible nightmare of active minds,
effectually prevented any ease. He tossed
and tumbled between the sheets, and
counted the slow, interminable hours, until
at length dawn brought temper ar} unconsciousness.
When he arose next

morning lie felt ill, both Ijcdily and
mentally. During the last month or six
weeks his nerves had been kept in a stale
of perpetual tension. Now they were sur-excited
and utterly unhinged. The unexpected
apparition of Will had proved too
much for them.

Out of doors everything was in unison
with his feelings. The thaw  such as it
was  still continued. The sky was grey,
so also was the earth ; a leaden mist, weird,
ghostly, phantom-like seemed to descend
from the one and to exude from the other.
It wrapped a sodden shroud around the
landscape ; the trees were black, and
shining' with a moisture which trembled
between ice and water ; patches of dirty
honeycombed snow lay about in all
directions. Occasionally, some loosened
clod would come slipping down from the
roof with a dull thud, and disintegrated
particles splashed against the windowpanes.

Oh ! the misery, and chilliness, and
dreariness of it all ! The desolation that it
conveyed ! Bob sighed, as he gazed around
him, at the big empty house, the wide park,
the dripping shrubs, and the melancholy
plantations. These things were very
beautiful in their way, but they wanted
sun. He missed the brightness and warmth
of an Australian winter.

How strange it seemed, to think that
Christmas Day was close at hand. He
wondered what his mother and Belle and
the little ones were about. What an age
since he had seen them. How much he
had lived and suffered in the time. He
could hardly believe that this Bob Jarrett
was the Bob Jarrett he had known informer
days ; such an utter change had
come over him. Once he had been a high-spirited,
happy-go-lucky young fellow, and
now

Into his aching heart there suddenly

surged a great, wild longing to see his
mother, to feel her cool lips pressed to his,
to hear her gentle voice bidding him go
forth and be of good cheer.

*' Oh ! mother, mother ! " he cried aloud,
in the bitterness of an anguish too great
for many words, " how I wish you were
with me at this moment."

Nevertheless he went out to meet his
fate like a man, and the little maid-servant
who answered Doctor Lankester's front
door bell had not the least suspicion how
every nerve and pulse possessed by Mr.
Eobert Jarrett, of Straighten Court, were
quivering like a girl's, when she led him
into the house and preceded him up the
narrow staircase, to which by this time
he was well accustomed.

LOVE BEFORE MONEY.

Bob was unceremoniously ushered into

Dot's presence, without the girl being asked

whether she were at home to visitors or

not. The maid-servant had, for some time

past, looked upon him as one of the family,

and felt flattered by the attentions he was

paying her young mistress.

In anticipation of a tete-astute. Bob had

carefully prepared a little set speech, which

he hoped would not only conceal his

excessive nervousness, but also pave the

way to asking that important question,

"Who is Will, and in what relation

does h& stand to you ? Is he your brother,

your cousin, or your lover ? " which he

was dying to put.

VOL. III. 44

But directly he saw Dot, lie forgot all
about his immediate intentions, and thought
only of her, and what he could do to serve
her. Eor she had been crying, there in
the drawing-room, all alone by herself.
His heart grew big at the thought of her
distress. A pair of very red eyes, set in a
piteous little pale face, unmistakably proclaimed
that she was in trouble.

So suddenly had he come upon her that
it was impossible to attempt any evasion,
as she seemed to realize, for with evident
embarrassment she advanced to meet him.

"Why, Miss Dot!" he exclaimed in
agitated tones, her emotion proving communicative,
" what on earth is the matter
with you ? "

There was something so Sympathetic and
concerned in his way of making the inquiry,
that for all answer she sat down on the
nearest seat, and hiding her face in her
hands, burst into a perfect storm of tears

Her slight frame was shaken by sobs, wliicli
no effort appeared able to suppress.

The sight of such grief as this, simply
maddened him, and rendered him oblivious
of every consideration of prudence or self-control.
His one instinct, one desire, was
to comfort her.

In an instant, he was down on his knees
by her side, his hat and stick rolling on the
floor, whilst, unconsciously almost, a
nervous arm stole round her waist  that
slender waist which he had so often
longed to encircle, and wondered whether
he ever should.

Dots Dot ! my darling, my own dear
little woman, don't cry, sweet one. I can't
bear to see you in this state. What is it
that vexes you ? "

No  no  nothing. P  please  get  
up, Mr. Jarrett."

"I can't. I won't. Oh! Dot," and he
tore her hands from her face and devoured

44*

them with passionate kisses. " You must
know how things are with me  you cannot
have been blind all this time. Dearest,
give me the right to take care of you, and
love you. I will move heaven and earth
to make your life happy, and keep all
trouble from you. Tell me what your
sorrow is, and let me share it." The
words were spoken at last. He clenched
his teeth, and waited to hear what answer
she would give him. A shudder ran
through her frame. She tried to push
away his arm with gentle force.

Don't, Mr. Jarrett, please don't. You
you mustn't."

Mustn't ! " he cried, with bitter pain.
Oh ! Dot, I can't help myself, for I do
love you so dearly."

Hush, pray don't speak so." And she
put out a warning hand. But she might
just as well have tried to stop a mountain
torrent m its impetuous course.

It's too late to tell me to keep quiet,"
he went on, with growing passion. " I can
no longer remain silent."

Indeed  indeed it would be best," she
interrupted.

Perhaps so, but one cannot always stop
to choose the wisest course, even if one
would. Dot, I am desperate, and must have
an answer. Surely you can say yes or no."

Why do you insist on giving yourself
so much pain ? " she asked sadly.

Because, as I have said before, I love
you, and have loved you ever since the day
you came trotting down the road, and
opened that beastly gate for me. Of course
you have not thought of me. All this
comes as a surprise, but I will wait. Dot 
wait years until you get to care for me a
little bit, if only you will promise some day
to be my wife. Darling, say that I have
a chance''

His eloquent words, full of passionate

sincerity, recalled lier to herself, and to the
gravity of the situation. With an effort
she recovered her composure.

Mr. Jarrett," she said in a voice that
tried hard to appear steady, looking at him
with dim, compassionate eyes. " I am so
dreadfully sorry  I  I hoped you would
never put this question to me, for alas ! I
cannot answer it as you wish'

There was a moment's silence. Then he
staggered to his feet, and looked wildly
round the room. " You cannot," he ejaculated.
" Then there must be a reason, and
my suspicions are confirmed."

She hung her head, but made no reply.

Dot, for heaven's sake, don't keep meany
longer in suspense. This is a matter
of life or death to me."

What is it you wish to know ? " she
asked almost inaudible

I happened to be at the railway station
yesterday morning, and I saw you. You

met a young man there ; lie kissed you,
and 3'Ou seemed pleased that he should do
o. Is he "  and his utterance grew
thick  "is he anything to you ? I do
not seek to pry into your affairs from idle
curiosity, but I think I have a right to an
answer."

The colour flamed up into her face, but
she answered with quiet dignity :

You shall have one, Mr. Jarrett. The
gentleman you saw is my affianced husband.
We have been eno-ao-ed to each other for
very nearly three years."

Why did you not tell me this sooner ? '*
The words burst from him hoarse and
inarticulate.

How could I ? " she replied mournfully,
when my own parents refused to sanction
the engagement."

And you care for this man ? Dot, for
Heaven's sake, tell me the truth."

' Yes, I love him better than my life. I

would sacrifice everything in the world to
be his wife."

At this answer, Bob's senses grew dim.
The room suddenly swam before his eyes.
A sound as of mighty waves dashing
against the shore deafened his ears. For
several seconds darkness descended upon
his brain and literally paralyzed it with a
hideous and oppressive power. He grasped
at the back of a chair for support. The
world, life. Dot Lankester, appeared like an
indistinct dream. It was some time before
he recovered sufficient consciousness to be
aware that she was speaking to him and
looking up into his face with anxious,
frightened eyes.

Oh ! Mr. Harrel t. Are you ill ? What
is wrongs ? What  what have I done ? "'

He took no notice of her interrogations.
His mind could contain but one thought.

Is there no chance, Dot, none whatever
? Can nothim;] alter your decision ? "

he asked in a subdued, unnatural voice,
which sounded strange even to himself.

The tears rushed to her eyes. An overpowering
pity filled her being. He was so
honest, so good and unselfish, so worthy of
love, and yet  she had none to give.

No," she said softly but firmly. " I
cannot raise false hopes. I have tried very
hard to make 3"0u understand how things
were. Of course, when we first met, it did
not matter, and there seemed no special
reason why you should be told about Will.
But afterwards, when I began to suspect
that you liked me, then, although I was
not sure of the correctness of my suspicion,
I did my very best to impress upon your
mind the fact that some barrier existed
between us. If I had spoken out, as
perhaps I ought to have done, you might
have considered me forward, presumptuous
and conceited. It appeared to me immodest
to make sure of a man's love before

he had himself declared that his affections
were engaged. I was placed in a dilemma,
80 held my peace, though I now feel I have
been bitterly to blame' And once more
the tears threatened to overflow their soft-fringed
boundaries.

No, Dot," he said sorrowfully. " You
could not have told me the truth more
surely and impressively than you did. Only,
you see, I refused to take warning in time.
I do not wish to accuse anyone, but your
mother, some weeks ago, certainly led me
to believe that you were heart-whole ; she
even regretted the scarcity of eligible young
men in this part of the country."

If YOU knew mamma as well as I do,
you would not have paid any attention to

what she " began Dot, but she checked

herself suddenly, and blushed as red as a
rose. Her young voice rang with an
unconscious scorn, which revealed more,
than any number of condemnatory speeches.

A long pause ensued, Bob's brows were
knit. He was evidently recalling his first
interview with Mrs. Lankester, and no very-pleasant
memories resulted.

Dot was the first to speak.

Mr. Jarrett," she said at length, " I,
for one, have never wilfully deceived you,
but all the same, some little explanation is
your due. You think you have been badly
treated in this matter."

Not by you," he interposed. " Never
for one instant by you."

If not by me, then by my relatives.
It comes to the same thing. Have you
patience to listen to a long story ? if so I
can render clear some few points that now
very naturally puzzle you."

Patience ! " he retorted with keen
misery. " When this is the last time I
may ever be alone with you again. Oh !
Dot, I resemble a miser counting his
money. Every moment spent in your company

is like precious gold. Would that
your story would last as long as there is
life in my wretched body'*

She put her finger to her lips, gently
rebuking the desolate and rebellious spirit
he displayed, yet the heart within her was
very sore, and swollen with compassion.

He had been such a true, staunch friend
to her, and she liked him so much ; she so
thoroughly appreciated his many sterling
qualities, and the kindliness and simplicity
of his nature. Fate, and fate alone, had
brought into her horoscope somebody else
before she had ever had the chance of meetings
him. Otherwise the issue mii][ht have
been very different. Mr. Jarrett was rich,
a splendid match in every way for the
daughter of a humble village doctor. And
Will was poor ; so poor that he could not
afford to keep a wife, and might not be
able to indulge in such a luxury for many
years. Without being worldly, she knew

enoucrli of the world to realize all the
advantages offered by an alliance with Mr.
Jarrett, of Straighten Court. Yet no
thought of disloyalty to Will found even a
temporary dwelling place in her mind,
alt-hough since their last meetings a horrible
suspicion embittered her very existence.
She wished she had a twin sister exactly
like herself in outward appearance, but infinitely
more deserving in every other way,
so that Bob could marry her and be comforted.
" The pity of it, the pity of it."
That was her predominating feeling. Such
a waste of valuable affection  an affection
calculated to make any girl supremely
happy  thrown away in a wrong direction.
Love, so precious and so holy, when genuine
ass in the present case, showered upon one
who had not the power to return it. everything
at cross purposes, everything wrong.
This was how Dot felt. Bob had paid her
the greatest compliment a man can pay a

woman. Instead of filling( her soul with
joy, it had steeped it in sadness. All she
could do to alleviate his sufferings was to
give him her fullest confidence, and hold
nothing back. Absolute frankness on her
part might perhaps render things a little
less hard to bear on his. It might console
him somewhat, to learn that he had never
had a chance of gaining her love, since her
troth was plighted long before he had ever
set foot in Enijland, or dreamt of inheritance
his uncle's property. If she had been
brave and done violence to her feelings
sooner, then he might have been spared
much pain. She made a sign to Bob to be
seated, then drawing her chair close beside
him, began in a low but clear voice :

Did you happen to notice a grey stone
house, just outside Smallborough, standing
some little way back from the road, the
day you were good enough to mount me
on Kin u fisher ? "

You mean that quaint, old-fashioned
house with an apple orchard ? Yes, I
remember it well."

It was inhabited some few years ago by
one Mr. Barrington, and his wife and children.
In those days they were comfortably
off, and Mr. Barrington lived the life of a
country squire. The eldest boy, Will,
when quite a child, displayed a perfect
passion for surgery."

Your Will, Dot? " interrupted Bob.

"Yes," reddening, "my Will." Then
she added under her breath, "My Will
that was ; pray God he is so still." When
he was eighteen," she continued in a louder
key, " my father, partly through friendship
and partly because Will's presence was an
additional source of income, took him to
live with us as a gentleman apprentice. At
that time I was fifteen years old, but I had
known Will ever since my childhood. We
had had many a romp together, and he

always distinguished me from the other
girls in the neighbourhood, and declared
that I was his little sweetheart, and should
marry him some day. When he came to
live with us, and we saw each other constantly,
our affection ripened. On his
twenty first birthday he went to my parents
and asked them to give their consent to his
courtship. To make a long story short, we
were formally engaged."

And how old were you ? " asked her
listener. " You look such a baby, even
now."

Just a few days over seventeen. Will
and I had one week's perfect happiness,
and then bad times came for both of us.
His father woke up one fine morning to
find himself ruined throuo:li the absconding
and mal practices of a fraudulent trustee.
Instead of poor Will receiving an income,
he had now to work for his living in
earnest, and could congratulate himself

on having adopted a profession. I
hardly like to repeat all that took place
in our family. Suffice it, that my mother,
who as long as she thought Will's people
were rich, quite approved of the marriage,
and in fact had done her best to promote
it, now suddenly turned round and refused
to sanction our engagement."

That was awful hard lines upon you,"
murmured Bob.

Yes, it was, for she insisted upon my
giving Will up, and having nothing more to
say to him."

And did you ? "

How could I ? People can't change
like that simply because they are told to.
You can order a good many things in this
world, but you can't order a loving heart
to transfer its allegiance."

Aye, that's true," sighed Bob regretfully.


I could no more desert poor Will when
VOL. III. 45

lie was in trouble, and most needed sympathy
and encouragement, than fly," continued
Dot warmly. " I refused flatly to obey
my mother's bidding. Then came scenes,
horrible to remember. We have never
been quite friendly since."

Did not your father take your part ?
He seems so fond of you."

Yes, in a way. He was far from
approving of my mother's conduct, but he
did not dare say much, on account of
Matilda, whose poverty is always thrown
in his face. Neither did he at all like the
idea of a lon<x enj]fafem.ent, likely to last
for years. In short, the marriage was
broken off, only Will and I vowed when we
wished each other good-bye, that we would
be true and faithful, and never, never, never
marry anybody else." Dot here tried hard
to suppress a sob. She could not tell any
Kvinc: beiiiix, the new trouble that weighed
so heavily upon her spirits. Her short

interview vsitli Will had left her sadder
than before. He seemed to have become
estranged, and to be concealing something
from her.

"And wore your father and mother
aware of this resolution ? " asked Bob,

Oh ! dear, yes. Papa did what he
could to help us-by getting Will a minor
appointment at one of the big London
hospitals, which at all events enabled him
to keep himself. As for my mother, she
refused to allow the poor boy's name to be
mentioned in her presence, and so you see
you see," said the girl, breaking down
completely, " that was how you never
came to hear anything about him. But
mother was not as much to blame as you
seem to think, since although I considered
myself engaged, she did not."

Bob had grown paler and paler during
the above recital. It effectually quenched
any last remaining hopes, and made his

45*

cup of bitterness overflow. Dot's love
was evidently no mere idle fancy, but a
deep-rooted passion, which neither opposition
nor distance had been able to overcome.
That fortunate Will ! What if he
were penniless ? He envied him from the
bottom of his heart, and would gladly have
changed places with him, had it been
possible.

Do you understand ? " said Dot, wondering
at his continued silence.

"Yes," he said in a hoarse, constrained
voice, " I understand, and there is nothing
more to be said. I only beg pardon for
my folly."

' Don't call it folly," she returned. " It
is * kismet.' We mortals have really very
little power over the march of events."

What were you crying about when I
came in ? " he asked abruptly.

She flushed crimson. It was impossible
to reveal the distracting thought that tor-merited

lier, and wbicli was the real cause
of her present disquietude.

It seems that one of the people in the
village saw me at the station yesterday.
Will was only passing through on business.
I had not seen him for a whole year, and
he wrote and begged me to meet him ;
and oh ! Mr. Jarrett, I could not help
doinfif so. I knew if I asked mamma's
leave she would not give it, so I went
without. She was dreadfully angry, and
said such cruel, cruel things."

Dot could not tell the whole truth ; and
it was easier to account for her red eyes in
this way than in any other.

What sort of things ? " inquired Bob,
not trusting himself to look at his companion.


She went on about my giving Will up,
and called him a pauper and horrible
names, which made my blood boil, and
then she wanted me to promise to "

Marry me, eh ? " lie said grimly.
Well, go on," he continued, as Dot
turned scarlet. " Had you any other
cause of trouble, or was that the sole
one ? "

'Is it very wicked to wish for things
one can't have ? " she rejoined innocently.

I don't know ; but if it is, I am a
veritable fiend at this moment."

"I do so wish I had five thousand
pounds."

Five thousand pounds 1 Why, what
would you do with such a sum ? "

Give it to Will, of course. He has a
splendid opening. An excellent practice has
been offered to him in one of the suburbs
of London, which is worth between four
and five hundred a sear, but the present
practitioner would have to be bought out,
and that is just what Will can't do."

'' Is there no chance of his setting: the
money, or of his father helping him ? "

No, none, whatever. Mr. Barrington
can't, poor man, even if he would. We
had a long talk about it yesterday, and put
our heads together, but neither of us
could see our way in the least. Will says
this practice would be the making of him,
and that it is absurd for people to think of
marrying without a proper income."

Was he always so wise ? " inquired
Bob.

She hesitated a moment, and then with
a sudden burst of tears, said, "No, not
always. Once upon a time he never seemed
to care about the money part of the business,
but he does now."

And was that what you were crying
about. Dot? "

Yes, I suppose so. What with one
thing and another, I felt regularly out of
sorts this morning."

Bob stood up, as if to go. A wild,
insensate joy surged up into his heart

when he heard that a very real obstacle
existed, which would prevent the girl from
becoming Will Barrington's wife, at all
events for a considerable time. Delay
meant a chance still. He might profit by
the young people's difficulties. The next
moment he felt thoroughly ashamed of himself
for harbouring such a feeling. Was
this his love ? this his devotion ?

What a poor, base, selfish passion was
that, which refused to rejoice in the
happiness and welfare of its object. How
mean and unworthy of an honest man. A
flush of self-abasement coloured his cheek.

Dot," he said, " answer me one question,
though it is absurd my asking it. Do
you care very much for this Will of yours,
so much that you feel as if you could not
live without him ? "

She looked up into his face. The solemnity
of his manner awed her.

Yes, Mr. Jarrett, that is exactly how

I do feel. You are not angry with me,
are you ? "

Angry ? No ; wliy should I be angry
simply because the love of as dear and
honest a girl as ever walked this earth is
not for me ? Only I wish to goodness that
Will had never been born."

He came first," she said simply. " I
knew him long before I knew you. I can't
help myself now."

His sense of rectitude admitted. the plea.
There was no gainsaying its truth.

Yes," he said, " he came first, lucky
beggar. That's where the mischief lay.
And now I am going. Good-bye, Dot, dear,
may God bless'you, and send you health
and happiness."

The tears trickled down her face. There
was something in her heart which she
scarcely understood, and which she suppressed
as treason to Will.

Good-bye, Mr. Jarrett. You will let

me be your friend still, von't you ? I  I
shall see you sometimes ? "

Yes, most certainly. But I think I
shall go away for a bit  at all events until
I have got over this." Then he took her
hand in his, and added hastily " And, I
sa', Dot, don't be low-spirited. Look at
the cheerful side of things, there's a dear.
I feel certain they'll all come right in the
end." And with that he was gone, leaving
her to wonder what was the special quality
which enabled him, when he suffered so
cruelly himself, to draw a veil over his own
disappointment, and seek only to comfort
her. All at once she realized that he had
even higher attributes than she had given
him credit for. The pleasant, upright,
straightforward, yet withal somewhat simple
and unpolished youth was capable of
real heroism. She felt that had it not been
for Will's prior claims, she never could
have sent him away. But Bob's heart as

lie walked towards home might have been
made of lead.

Every hope that had ever nourished it,
and caused it to beat fast and slow by
turns, was now finally crushed. He felt as
if his life were at an end. All the joy and
the physical enjoyment of existence had
vanished. What were wealth and position
without Dot to share them ?

Henceforth there was nothing to look
forward to, nothing to strive for, nothing to
live for. He looked up abstractedly at the
sky. It was grey and sombre. But not
greyer or more sombre than his thoughts.
He glanced at the cold earth, enshrouded in
spectral mist. It was drear and gloomy.
But not drearier or gloomier than seemed
his future.

How the wind blew, and soughed through
the leafless trees! How it penetrated to
the very bones, and defied even the warmest
clothing.

And out in Australia the sun was
shining, the cattle were straying over the
brown ground, panting for shade, and his
mother was probably at that very moment
basking in the verandah .with the little
ones around her. Oh ! the sun, and the
warmth, and the peace. How he longed
for them all. With Schopenhauer, his
weary soul cried out for " the blissful repose
of nothing."

And then a chilly blast opposed his
progress, the rain came sleeting down, and
he coughed. The cough reminded him
that the body has inherited a heritage of
pain. Through his back, through his
chest and his shoulder-blades there stole a
dull acliino: sense of discomfort, which
came as an aggravating accompaniment to
his mental misery, just as if the one were
not enou2[li without the other.

JUMPING MUDDYEORD BOTTOM.

Fortunately, unhappy thoughts, like
everything else on this earth, are subject
to the law of finality Before long Bob's
meditations were interrupted in an altogether
unexpected fashion.

As he turned in at the gate of his own
park, the blast of a horn fell upon his ears,
waking echoes that had slept silent for
many a day ; and a few minutes afterwards
he found himself overtaken by the whole
of the Morbey Anstead Hunt, who chased
their fox into his shrubberies, and pursued
him hotly, until the hounds became perplexed
by the number of fresh animals that
sprang up. The rain now came down in
torrents, discharged with icy force from a

lowering cloud overhead. So fierce was
this shower that it caused a halt in the
proceedings, and people with one accord
began to look about for an available place
of shelter.

"Won't you come in? You had much
better all come in," cried Bob, addressing
friends and foes alike. '' It's not a bit of
good standing out there and getting wet
through. Come in, come in, and welcome."

So hearty was the hospitality offered, and
so intensely disagreeable the weather, that
a considerable number of people gladly
responded to his invitation. One set the
example to the other, and very soon there
was quite a crowd of men and vomen
inside the spacious hall of Straighten
Court, tossing off Bob's brown sherry with
evident relish, and nibbling daintily at
sandwich or biscuit. The servants had
not had such a bustling up for many a
year, and were amazed at so heterogeneous

an influx of visitors, the majority of whom
their late master would not have condescended
to talk to, much less ask beneath
his roof. " Quantity, but not quality,"
sneered the pompous butler to his satellite,
as he passed him bearing a loaded tray of
empty glasses. As for Bob, it cheered him
to see human faces around. It was far
better than coming home and finding the
place empty, and having nothing to do but
sit down and think over the events of the
morning. He tried to drive away thought
by moving about among his guests and
personally attending to their wants, and he
won the hearts of all the farmers present
by ringing the bell and ordering up some
very choice old port for their especial
benefit, and wishing cood luck to agriculture.
But he looked in vain for Lord
Littelbrane. His lordship was as obstinately
stand-off as on the never-to-be-forootten
occasion of Stiffton Flat races. Neither

could he discern General Prosieboy, wdiicli
caused him some slight wonderment, for he
had made a pretty correct estimate of that
gentleman's character.

However, he would probably have felt
consoled for his absence, had he been
aware of the fact, that the gallant old
warrior was at that very moment imbibing
a glass of stiff whisky and water in a
covered yard at his (Bob's) expense, and
exchanging witticisms with the under-housemaid.


Ladies are proverbially brave, and Lady
De Fochsey, not calculating on quite such
a day, had gone out hunting with the rest.
StifTshire was a county that offered but few
resources for the stay-at-homes. Those who
did not follow the chase led lives of absolute
stay-nation ; and a frost was terrible, for all
the idle young men went posting off to
London immediately, and there were none
but old fogies left to talk to.

"Now her ladyship's smart scarlet jacket,
with its white facings, light waistcoat and
etceteras, had cost the best part of sixteen
guineas ; as a consequence she entertained
a erreat reo-ard and veneration for it.
Having sallied forth without a covert coat,
she was in considerable trepidation at the
thought of the beautiful, extra fine cloth
stretching, and the entire garment thus
becoming too large. It fitted without a
wrinkle at present, but what might be the
result if once it "sot wet throuh ? This
was the first season she had ventured to
appear in " pink," and so far she had been
fortunate enough to escape any drenching
rain. The scarlet came out as fresh and
bright as ever, and filled her every time she
wore it with an impression of her own
good looks, which to a naturally pretty
woman was eminently agreeable and gratifying
in the extreme.

But to-day the weather threatened to
VOL. III. 46

rob this much-prized garment of all its
brilliancy. After her last somewhat unfriendly
parting with Mr. Jarrett, she had
resolved in a fit of petulance to have
nothing more to say to him. There was
a point when running after men became a
nuisance, and did not repay the inevitable
trouble. If, in spite of all his aptitudes,
Bob refused to act the part of " kindred
spirit," why, then she must look about her
and find one elsewhere. A vulgar saying,
but a true, had it that there were " as
many fish in the sa as ever came out of
it."

It was quite . possible to establish
psychological relations with some individual
more responsive, and altogether
endowed with finer sensibilities. Mr.
Jarrett was good-looking, but horribly
matter-of-fact. He looked at things from
quite a vulgar and material point of view.

In spite of such reflections, when her

ladyship saw several of her friends and
acquaintances march boldly into Straighten
Court, after first leaving their horses in the
spacious stables, she put her pride in her
pocket, and followed suit. The scarlet
jacket was more important at this juncture
than dignity ; already there were great,
dark splashes upon it, and she could almost
fancy that the waist had begun to expand.

So she jumped hastily to the ground,
threw her reins to the nearest groom, and
entered the house without more ado. Her
theory was, that woman should always
cultivate a chameleon-like nature, since in
the first place circumstances forced her to
be adaptive ; and in the second, it gave her
such an enormous advantage, when she
could present many fronts to her natural
enemy  man. Nothing disconcerted him
so much as blowing hot and cold by turns.

When Bob saw who the new arrival was,
a smile spread over his features.

46*

Lady De Fochsey ! " he exclaimed intones
of unmistakable gratification, " this
is indeed kind. I thought you had made
up your mind, after our last meeting, to
join the majority, and cut me dead."

She looked a little embarrassed at this
speech, but turned it off with a laugh.

You were a very foolish, headstrong
boy, but I dare say you have grown wiser
by this time, and at any rate, I intend to
give you another chance," she said with a
pretty arch smile.

I'm delighted to hear it. I could not
bear to think we had quarrelled."

*' It was your own fault," she rejoined,
sipping at a glass of sherry which Bob had
just handed her. " But as a proof of my
magnanimity I give you your choice.
What is it to be, war or peace ? Decide
either way 3'ou like." And she made a little
coquettish grimace, quite thrown away upon
the person it was intended to captivate.

Oil 1 peace, peace," he murmured
hurriedly ; "I am far too miserable at
the present moment to care to be at
loggerheads with any one."

She raised her eyebrows in astonishment,
and looked at him keenly and critically.
As she did so, she was struck all at once by
the altered expression of his countenance,
which made it appear almost ten jesivs
older. His despondency and dejection were
so great that he did not even seek to
conceal them, as most certainly he would
have striven to do later on. A deep soul-weariness
prevents good acting.

Why, Bob," she ejaculated, falling back
into the familiar style of nomenclature first
adopted, " what on earth's the matter with
you? You look all to pieces."

I look what I am, then."

But what's wrong. What are you
miserable about ? "

No  no  nothing," he stammered in

return ; " at least, nothing that I care to
talk of."

Is it money ? "

"No."

' Business ? "

No."

Family worries ? "

"No."

Then it's love as a matter of course.
It can't possibly be anything else."

He tossed off a glass of wine, but made
no reply. She, however, needed none.

1 suppose the ' beautiful being ' who I
chaffed you about the other day is at the
bottom of this tremendously tragical affair,
eh?" she resumed insistently. "Has the
young person not been kind ? "

Bob still maintained an obstinate silence.
It was torture to have his freshly-inflicted
wound so mercilessly probed by a cruel
female hand. He writhed like a captured
bird caught in a net.

Come, it's not very civil of you to
decline to answer a question made by a
lady. How is lie ? "

"How is who?" he asked irritably,
goaded into speech at last.

Why ! your little friend in the patched
habit  the doctor's daughter ; or if you
want it put clearer, the girl you were
carrying on with so outrageously."

The blood flew to his brow. Indignation
made every muscle quiver.

I presume you mean Miss Lankester !
and as for carrying on, as you call it, I'm
not carrying on at all."

Oh ! aren't you ? Since when have
you come to your senses, pray ? "

Since half-past ten o'clock this
morning, if you must know the precise
hour."

Well, I'm glad you've escaped from
that exceedingly forward and immodest
young woman. And all I can say is, that

the way she ran after you out hunting was
really quite disgusting''

"She didn't do anything of the sort," he
retorted angrily. " And please don't
slander her."

I'm not slandering her ; nasty, sly
little elinor, though I'm sure she deserves

it."

Yes, you are, and if you want to hear
the truth of the matter, I'll tell it you,
rather than stand by and hear Miss Lankester
abused."

"Well?" said her ladyship interrogatively,
making no attempt to conceal her
curiosity.

Miss Lankester, instead of behaving in
the manner you assert, happens to be
already engaged, and won't have a word to
say to me. There ! " And Bob clenched
his teeth in anguish.

She shrugged her shoulders with a truly
provoking gesture of incredulity. That a

person in the exceedingly humble position
of a country doctor's daughter, should
stick to any pre-formed engagement, when
she had the chance of securing Mr. Jarrett,
of Straighten Court, surpassed her comprehension
altogether. Her mind could
not realize the possibility of so tremendous
an act of folly.

*' Pshaw ! What's the good of telling me
such nonsense as that. I really wonder
where you expect to go to."

But again he relapsed into silence. Her
lively sallies could not succeed in rousing
him from the dejection in which he was
steeped. This fact dawned upon her by
degrees. She began to be aware that something
was very seriously wrong with him.
Now that there was no longer any question
of rivalry she could afford to be generous
and sympathetic. Besides, men were often
caught on the rebound. If he lead not
been so good-looking she would not have

troubled herself about him one bit.'but as
it was, she could not help feeling interested
in his sorrows  imaginary or otherwise.

"Bob," she said with increasing kindliness.
" Am I to understand that you have
proposed co this little insignificant girl, and
that she has actually refused you ? "

He turned sharply away. Her eyes
seemed to sear him like scorching flame.
Why could she not leave him alone ? What
was it to her, whether he had asked Dot
Lankester to be his wife or not ?

Lady De Fochsey," he said with a
petulant gesture, " you are of course at
liberty to draw any conclusions you choose
from our conversation. I can only say
that the subject is a painful one, and I
would feel obliged by your not discussing
it. I  I "  breaking down suddenly 
'' am very unhappy."

She might be foolish, but apart from her
vanities and coquetry, she was by no means

a bad-hearted woman. Moreover, lie felt
that she had pressed him a trifle ungenerously.
His utter despondency caused
her to experience a sensation of genuine
emotion, such as she had not felt for a
long time.

How nice it must be to be loved like
this. How happy it would make her to
inspire so real a passion.

There was something artless and engaging
about him ; simple, perhaps, yet withal
different from other men of her acquaintance.
His youth, too, appealed to her.
Ever since she had turned five-and-twenty
she had developed a strong partiality for
boys. Candour and innocence were
refreshing from their very rarity.

Look here, Bob," she said, " you and
I may have had our little differences, but
I'm not one to bear malice, and if you feel
low-spirited, and in want of sympathy and
consolation, why then," giving his hand a

Ljentle pressure, " you know where to

come."

A lump rose up in his throat. He was
much too wretched to care to avail himself
of the invitation, but he felt that it was
kindly meant. And a little kindness goes
such a long way when one is in trouble.
In a curiously husky voice he said,
Thank you," and then hurried away to
the nearest window, where he stood for
several seconds resolutely forcing back a
certain moisture that dimmed his eyesight.
Lady De Fochsey had never been so near
converting him into a medium capable of
receiving and transfusing electric force, but
her success was due to human sympathy
and not to spiritualistic agencies. A break
in the sky, a gleam of sickly ligt, and an
abatement in the rain now caused those
within doors to hurry out in search of their
horses.

Directly his guests showed symptoms of

departing, Bob went upstairs and hastily
donned hunting attire. He might as well
go out as stay at home ; moreover, he felt
in a mood when, to ride recklessly at a
certain number of big fences, and to gallop
at full speed across the green pastures
would act as a sedative and bring relief to
his overwrought nerves.

He had previously ordered Kingfisher to
be got ready. He had never yet been on
his back, having, up till to-day, religiously
reserved his best horse for Dot ; but now 
and a wave of bitterness flooded his spirit
what was the use of any longer keeping
him for that purpose ? After what had
passed, he felt that nothing would ever
induce her to ride him again, and place
herself under an obligation. He remembered
her original reluctance, which of
course would henceforth be intensified.

Oh ! how sad it was, to find all one's
dreaming, dreams and not realities  to seethe

airy structure of hope and love, so
skilfully constructed in the chambers of
one's mind, crumble away at the first unexpected
stroke. What a blankness and
dreariness remained behind when all the
picturing of the imagination proved vain
and could never be attained. How brightness
turned to darkness, pleasure to pain,
and youth to premature old age. Life was
very, very cruel ; despair its key-note. So
he mused as he mounted his horse.

A minute or two later, Burnett sallied
forth from the washhouse, where he had
taken refuse, and calling: to his hounds to
follow him, trotted out on to the lawn,
where he was soon joined by the entire
field. By this time there was not much
chance of hitting of! the line of the hunted
fox, so it was resolved to draw sundry plantations
within the precincts of the park.
A small spinney was first called upon, which
immediately furnished a fine, white-tagged

old fellow. Judi?inQ[ from his behaviour he
appeared to be a stranger, for, unlike the
home-bred article, he showed no disposition
to linger, but at once set his mask straight
for the open.

Owing to the recent frost, the weather,
and various causes, the Field was a much
smaller one than usual, and all those who
meant '' going " could do so to-day, and
had no excuse for lagging behind. Even
the starting rush for the nearest available
gate was comparatively mild, and no one
got blocked for more than a few seconds.
Consequently, everybody possessing the inclination
secured a good start. A chorus
of melodious music filled the air. From
deep-throated followers burst the familiar
sound which cheers the heart of every
thorough sportsman. Hounds dashed out
of the spinney and flashed across the greensward
like a silver comet.

What mattered then the wind and the

rain, when two and twenty couple were
racing ahead, throwing their tongues joyously
and flinging after their quarry with
glorious dash and resolution ? Who cared
then if the sky were grey or blue, the
atmosphere dry or moist, the wind chilly
or the reverse ? Every mind, human as
well as canine, was concentrated on the
chase. A look of determination stole over
men's features. They set their jaws, tightened
their reins, settled themselves in their
saddles, and prepared to ride hard in defiance
of cold and wet. In another minute
they were out of the park and into the
fields beyond. Ilere the fun began, for
Eeynard was evidently determined on putting
roadsters to confusion, and chose a beeline
across country.

KiQ. the fences round Straighten villaf]e
were always, but to-day they seemed even
bigger than usual, or else this crafty pug
had a better notion of baulking the enemy.

Without hesitation he led his foes straight
down to a yawning bottom, with a thickset
fence on the near side, and a positively
ghastly gully on the off. The line of pursuit
was checked. A more awkward obstacle
could not well be imagined. In the
annals of the Hunt it was recorded that no
man had ever cleared Muddyford Bottom
at this particular spot.

With muttered execrations, the leading
horsemen  Burnett amongst the rest 
pulled up and looked round for a place
where, with a crawl, a splash and a lucky
scramble, they could get in and out.

Bob had two advantages over his companions.
He was a stranger and did not
know the country, and he was reckless  at
all events on this particular day. To break
his neck out hunting seemed to him just
then the highest good that was left to him
in life. He courted death, though deathlike
a shy maiden, is apt to refuse too
VOL. III. 47

ardent a wooer. The biircrer the fence, the
more eagerly did Bob welcome it. It did
not matter what evil befell him, now that
Dot had given him his cone. Of any effect
he was likely to produce, he did not think
for an instant. He was much too miserable
to care any longer for other people's
opinions.

His face was drawn, his eyes wild and
bloodshot. Those who noticed his appearance
whispered that he had been drinking
heavily, but this was a libel. He might
not be over sane, but at all events liquor
had nothing to do with his insanity. It
was unrequited passion that rendered him
obvious to personal danger, and lent him
a courage bordering on madness.

Anyhow, whilst his neighbours were
coasting up and down the Bottom, and
hounds were rapidly disappearing from
vision, though their keen notes came
floating backward to the ear  for the ladies

were garrulous to-day  lie took Kingfisher
sharply by the head, turned him round and
rushed him at the formidable chasm.

The good horse was only just out of his
stable, and as fresh as paint. He needed
no second invitation, especially with the
pack stealing away in front of him.
Besides, it required an exceptionally
awkward fence to stop him. Other horses
might find Wiltshire tax their powers, but
it was not often that he failed to prove
equal to the occasion. But best of all,
his heart was in the right place.

He made a magnificent bound, and did
not attempt to refuse. Only when he saw
what an abyss confronted him on the
landing side, he jerked his hind quarters
round with a desperate effort. Even then
he dropped both hind legs, and threw Bob
rioht on to his neck. For a second it was
touch and go whether he would fall or not,
but he was as active as a cat, and making

47*

a fifallant strui?f]fle, recovered himself, and
was up and away in less time than it takes
to tell of.

For once, Muddyford Bottom had been
fairly jumped. It measured four and
twenty feet across, and so much was it
dreaded that not another soul ventured to
follow Bob's example. He was alone with
hounds, and gained an advantage which
throughout the run none succeeded in
wresting from him.

The Mutual Adorationites gnashed their
teeth with impotent rage. They could not
produce a Mmrod to compete with the
much abused and despised " outsider,"
whom, without even knowing, tliev had
seen fit to condemn. Not one of their
number could touch him. He showed his
back to the whole crew, lords, generals and
captains, and in some quarters there was
glee, in others, tribulation.

Meantime, Bob pursued his victorious

career. His blood was literally on fire.
A wild, hot glow pervaded his entire
frame. He was scarcely conscious of his
own actions. It still seemed to him as if
he were trying to battle his way out of
some dark nightmare which oppressed his
spirit with a maddening intensity. He kept
his eye vacantly fixed on the leading
hounds, and took little or no heed of the
intervening fences. Kingfisher was left
to negotiate them as he pleased, and perhaps
for that reason jumped all the
more perfectly, for he dearly liked
having his head and not being interfered
with.

And now it came on to pour again
mercilessly. In five minutes the rain had
penetrated through every portion of Bob's
coat. But he never even noticed it. He
was impervious to outside considerations.
The chaos of his brain refused external
detail. Even excitement could not

altogether chase away despair, though it
lightened it for the time being.

Had he been riding any other horse but
Kingfisher, he must have " come to grief "
a dozen times over. As it was, his escapes
were marvellous. Boxers, bullfinches,
break-neck timber, nothing could stop him.
Where the hounds went there went he,
himself and steed seeming to possess supernatural
powers.

That run is famous to this day in the
chronicles of the Morbe} Anstead Hunt.
The Field and the County Gentleman wrote
such glowing paragraphs about it, that it
is needless to describe it minutely. Even
those who most felt their defeat admitted
that one man had the best of it throughout,
and that this fortunate and much-to-be
envied individual was Eobert Jarrett, Esq.,
of Straighten! Court.

When, after fifty-five panting minutes.
Bob pulled up his foaming horse, and

held the dead fox aloft, amid a circle of
clamouring hounds, whilst he waited for
Burnett to make his appearance, he little
dreamt of the glory he had gained, or
the reputation won. Nevertheless, during
those few sweet moments, he almost
enjoyed himself and forgot Dot. But not
for long.

When the fun was over and the excitement
at an end, then the internal force
evaporated which had hitherto sustained
him. A sick, weary, deadening feeling
stole over his frame. He had but the
one horse out, who had earned undying
fame, but the gallant animal was done
to a turn, which was not to be wondered
at, seeing that having received no orders
to the contrary, Matthews had watered
and fed him as usual. And now Bob
patted Kingfisher mechanically on the
neck, and turned his head towards
home.

Hunting was a first-rate sport. No one
relished it more than he did  but, after
all, hunting was not Dot, and without
Dot life had lost its flavour.

Eleven miles as the crow flies had that
good, stout-hearted fox taken him from
Straighten Court. It was quite dark
when he reached home. The short December
day had closed in, and the rain
still descended with steady persistency.

He felt it now, for the warmth which
had animated his blood while the run lasted,
had slowly given place to a deadly chill.

He shivered as he rode under the dark
trees of the avenue, and heard drop after
drop roll to the ground. When he got
into the stable yard, he was so stiff and
so numbed that Matthews had to help
him to dismount. His hands and feet
had lost all sensation.

Take a warm bath, sir, take a warm
bath, and 'ave a drop of something hot to

drink," counselled the groom, as this old
master stood and trembled. " It's been a
mortal cold day, and you've got a regular
chill on you."

But Bob, instead of listening to good
advice, insisted on loitering about, until he
had ascertained that Kingfisher was none
the worse for his exertions.

I should think myself a very poor sort
of sportsman, Matthews," he said, " if I
looked after No. One before looking after
my horse."

Matthews smiled approvingly. The more
he saw of Bob the better he liked him.

There's a many gentlemen," he said,
in this country who rides well, but there
be mighty few who considers their 'losses
afore themselves. Times 'as haltered since
I was a boy. But now go and get changed,
do-ee. What am I here for, except to see
after the nags ? " Upon which. Bob entered
the house.

A PARTING BEQUEST.

The next day Bob was seriously ill ; so ill
that he was obliged to send for Doctor Lankester
to come and see him in his professional
capacity. Tie had had no rest
all night, a sharp pain in his side, accompanied
by an unusual difficulty in breathing
having quite prevented his getting any
sleep. During the long hours of darkness
he jumped the Muddy ford Bottom a
hundred times in imagination, whilst every
formidable fence cleared during that never-to-be-forgotten
run, appeared photographed
upon his brain with the distinctness of a
miniature.

Doctor Lankester found him sitting

cowering over a blazing fire in the smoke


His eyes were bright, his cheeks unnaturally
flushed, his skin dry and parched ;
yet, in spite of these and other feverish
symptoms, he complained of an intense
feeling of chilliness.

You say you have a pain in your left
side ? " asked the doctor.

"Yes, dreadful. It's just like a knife
running through one."

Hem ! And you experience difficulty
in breathing ? "

I do. Once or twice during the night
I though I should have been suffocated'*

Are you hot and cold by turns, or do
you feel cold all the time ? "

Now you mention it, I get awfully
warm every now and then."

Ah ! I thought so. You will have to
be careful, my dear boy, and do exactly as
I tell you."

Although Doctor Lankester was far too
experienced in his profession to alarm a
patient needlessly, his grave countenance
showed that he did not at all like Bob's
appearance. Acting with medical authority,
he ordered him back to bed at
once, recommending warmth and quiet.
He saw these orders obeyed, and remained
some little time giving instructions to
Charles, who was appointed to wait upon
the invalid.

What a fuss about nothing ! " exclaimed
Bob, trying to speak cheerily. But though
he professed a great disdain of coddling,
he was glad to be forced to lie still, since
he realized that he was considerably worse
than he chose to admit.

Doctor Lankester gave him no choice,
but put him on the sick list there and
then, and in his heart of hearts he thankfully
submitted.

After a while the doctor took his leave,

saying lie would send round some suitable
medicine and look in aoain later on.

He was as good as this word, for towards
evening he once more visited Straiglitem
Court, and stayed there over an hour,
personally seeing that all his directions had
been carried out. This having been done,
he was distressed to find Bob worse instead
of better, and the suspicions which he had
entertained earlier in the day now received
the fullest confirmation. He no looser
doubted what his friend's malady was, and
therefore took it upon himself to give the
necessary orders.

Entirely on his own responsibility he
telegraphed to a well-known London
institution for a trained nurse to be sent
down the first thing the next morning. He
knew nor that the young man's illness
was no passing indisposition, but likely to
prove a serious affair, requiring the
greatest care and attention. Bob's lonely

position filled him with compassion, and he
was determined, individually, to do all he
could do for him.

When he reached home he said as much
to his daughter. Mrs. Lankester had gone
to dine with a relation, and was not
expected back till the evening.

I'm afraid our friend Jarrett is in a bad
way," he concluded, after giving Dot a
detailed account of his patient's condition.
I don't like the look of things at all. He
doesn't know it, but he has got a weak
chest naturally, and our English climate
has played the bear with him."

Oh ! papa," cried the girl, alarmed by
the gravity of her father's manner, " remember
how cood he has been to us.
Don't let us leave the poor young man
alone in that great, dreary house. Can't
we have him here and nurse him ? "

"He is scarcely in a fit state to be
moved at present. Besides, your mother is

not a good one with illness in the house.
It fidgets her and puts her out."

* True, but I can't bear to think of his
having no one but servants to look after
him."

Her father smiled approval. She had
inherited his own warm heart.

You don't consider me of much good,
that's quite clear. Dot. Will you feel
satisfied when I tell you that it is my
intention to sit up with Mr. Jarrett tonight."


You ? Oh ! papa, that is kind of you.
But is he very bad, then ? "

I'm afraid so. He is in for an attack
of pleurisy, which threatens at any moment
to assume a dangerous nature. It seems
he went out hunting yesterday and got wet
to the skin."

"But he was here," she cried impulsively.
" He did not leave me till eleven
o'clock."

I don't know low that may be, but
the lad told me himself he had gone with
the hounds and caught a regular chill.
Dot," with a kindly look stealing over his
face, " we must pull him through if we
can."

' Oh ! yes, yes ; of course we must.
Only it all seems so sudden, and I can't
realize that he is ill. But you will want
a nurse. Why should not I be his nurse? "

I have already telegraphed for one."

May not I help ? I should like to if I
might." And she looked up with a pair of
pleading eyes.

"You shall later on. Dot ; but just now
I want you to stay at home and tell your
mother when she comes back where I am
spending the night, so that she need not be
under any alarm."

Two or three days passed away, and in
spite of every care and all conceivable
remedies, the patient showed no signs of

improvement. In vain did Doctor Lankester
prescribe opium and calomel and apply
mustard poultices ; they proved powerless
to subdue the disease. Another doctor
was called in, but he entirely approved of
the treatment already adopted, and beyond
one or two trifling susfiestions had
no advice to offer. Meantime Doctor
Lankester was beinnim? to entertain
grave fears for the result, and redoubled
his attentions. What puzzled and
distressed him most was the feeble vitality
possessed by this apparently strong, healthy
young man ; Bob seemed to have so little
recuperative power, and so small a share of
that physical clinging to life which is a
characteristic of nine human being's out often.
He could not help thinking that
something lay heavy on his mind.

Before long: Bob became delirious, and
then the good doctor guessed at the cause.
He was deeply touched when he learnt how
VOL. III. 48

great was the invalid's affection for his
(laughter. He would have welcomed him
as a son-in-law for his own sake, quite
apart from any worldly considerations,
having contracted a great liking, for the
young man. JN'ow he could only show his
good will by devoting all his spare hours
to him.

At the end of an anxious week, Dr. Lankester
almost gave up hopes of Bob's recovery.
True, the fever and pain had left
him, but he seemed frightfully weak, and
totally unable to rally. Unless some change
speedily took place, he foresaw that death
from exhaustion was imminent.

On the morning of the eighth day, as he
was sitting in the sick room, he was startled
by seeing Bob's eyes fixed earnestly upon
him, with an expression of fully restored
consciousness, which boded well.

"Doctor," he said feebly, "tell me the
truth ; I can bear it. Am  am I aoina" to

die ? " and his eyes looked larger and
solemn than ever.

Doctor Lankester made a vain effort
to speak, but a lump rose up in this throat,
and when he tried to give a consolatory-answer,
his voice failed him.

You need not trouble to tell me
what I want to know," continued Bob,
after a slight pause, during which he
had narrowly watched his companion's
countenance. " After all, it was a foolish
question."

There  there may be a chance yet,"
faltered the doctor in return. " You seem
better to-day."

Do I ? I'm sorry for that. The truth
is, I don't care to go on living."

But, my poor, dear friend, you are so
young to think. of death as a refuge from
trouble,"

That may be. But some young people
feel as old as the hills, and long for rest,

48*

and I am one of them. Can't you  can't
you understand ? "

"Yes," huskily, "I think so. I wish it
mi<dit all have been different."

"Thank you, doctor. Thank you for
saving those words. I always felt that I
had a friend in you. But don't be angry
with  with Dot," turning red as he pronounced
the girl's name. '* It was not her
fault"

No, I suppose not. These things can't
be helped."

And you see, if  if she had grown to
care for me, she would have been sorry
now, and as it is "  with a wan smile 
' nobody is much the worse. Dick will
step into my shoes when I am gone, and
the only person who will really feel my loss
deeply, will be my mother. Poor, dear old
mum ! I wish I could have seen her again
just to tell her not to mind."

Hush ! Bob, don't talk Hke that. You

mays pull through yet'' cried Dr. Lankester.
My belief is you could if you would. It's
your infernal indifference to life that keeps
you back in my opinion. If only you had
something to look forward to you would
pick up in no time."

I believe I should," answered the
patient with quiet conviction. " But that's
not likely."

Doctor Lankester's mouth was twitching.
His eyes were full of tears. He could no
longer hide his emotion, and rose as if to
leave.

Are you going ? " said Bob. " If so,
I wish you would do me a favour."

Of course I will. What is it ? "

I want you, please, to send to Stiffton
for a solicitor, and tell him to drive over
here at once."

Yes, Bob. Anything more ? "

The colour flamed up into the young
man's cheeks.

' Doctor," he said hesitatingly, " do you
do you think Dot wouhl come and seeme
? I should so like to speak to her once
more."

*' She shall come, but on one condition.
You must not excite or tire yourself."

Whereupon Doctor Lankester hurried
out oi the room, too much overcome to
continue the conversation. Any sudden
emotion might prove fatal to the patient in
his present condition ; on the other hand
if Dot could inspire in him a wish to live,
he was of opinion that Bob might still be
saved. Yet, how was he to induce his
daughter to transfer her affections from one
man to the other ? The task seemed
beyond his power, even were it right to
attempt it. The issue must lie with God.
Bob was closeted for a whole hour with
the lawyer, and when Doctor Lankester
re-entered the sick room, he was surprised
to find him considerably stronger and more

cheerful. Strange to say, the exertion
appeared to have done him good, and his
mind was evidently easier than it had been
for some time past.

Now, please, fetch Dot," he called out
impatiently, directly his medical adviser
approached.

Have you not done enough for today
? " rejoined that gentleman. " Don't
you think it will be wiser to wait till
tomorrow ? "

"Perhaps so, if I could make sure of
there being one for me. Oh ! Doctor
Lankester, if you knew how badly I want
to see her you would not refuse my
request."

His words contained a touching pathos,
which went straight to the cood doctor's
heart. He would have given half he
possessed to ensure for Bob not one but
many to-morrows ; the sick man was so
gentle and patient. He recognised with

such docility and submission that life was
but nature's plaything  a toy to be broken
up at any moment, and hurled into the unfathomable
abyss of eternity. He repined
not, neither did he bemoan his hard fate.
He was content to go  content to leave the
cold, pitiless earth, the winter snows and
summer sunshine, content even to part from
his beloved ; because she was not his
beloved, but another's.

Only a little common tragedy every day
played out to the bitter end by men and
women possessing loving and tenacious
hearts. As Dot had truly said, " Oh ! the
pity of it. The pity of it."

Quarter of an hour afterwards, the air
entered Bob's presence. He had altered so
much in these few days that she hardly
knew him, and the change shocked her to
such an extent that she was seized by a
fit of trembling. For his sake she had
determined to be brave and composed.

What were her bravery and composure
worth, since at one sight of the invalid
they vanished ?

The tears trickled down her cheeks,
and she bowed her head and sobbed
aloud.

Her emotion affected him deeply.

Dot," he said in a quivering voice,
don't cr}, dear. There's nothing to cry
about."

Oh ! Mr. Jarrett, I I can't help it. I
meant to behave well, indeed I did."

Call me Bob, will you ? I should like
to hear you call me by my Christian name
just for once, and," with a spasm of pain,
I don't think Will would be jealous."

flush ! " she cried, in an altered voice,
don't talk of Will."

'' I must. It is for that purpose I have
sent for you. The other day you told
me that you wanted live thousand
pounds "

"Oh, Mr. Jarrett  Bob, pray don't think
of my foolish words."

He raised himself on one elbow, and
looked at her.

"Dot," he said, "I hope you believe
that I love you well enough to serve
you."

Yes, yes, indeed. I don't deserve such
love as yours."

"If it pleases me to make you a gift of
five thousand pounds, and to render you
and Will happy, you won't refuse me, will
you ? It is the last favour I may ever
ask."

To his surprise, she flung herself down
by the bedside, and began sobbing as if
her heart would break.

"Dot ! " he said in alarm, " what have I
said ? What have I done ? "

Oh !  you  you are  so good. Your
generosity  touches m  me to the quick.
But  I  I  cannot take this money. Besides,"

she added despairingly, " it is of no
use to me now''

Why not ? Are you too proud to
accept even this small gift from me ? "

"Proud! No, but I am crushed and
miserable. Love, faith, honour, everything
seems unreal and a delusion, and the ideals
I have raised, the gods before whom have
bowed down and worshipped, prove brazen
images that topple down at a touch." And
her eyes shone fiercely.

Dot, what do you mean ? What are
you talking about ? "

You said you were my friend, Bob. 1
wonder whether you will understand me ?
I have suffered the pains of Purgatory for
eye whole days, and never spoken of them
to a soul. Now I feel as if I could keep
my sufferings to myself no longer, and must
talk to somebody. Five thousand pounds''
and she laughed hysterically. " You give
me five thousand pounds ! low noble, how

generous, how good ! But what is it for ?
what is it for ? "

To enable you to marry Will," he said
as steadily as he could, for the force of her
passion shook him.

She drew in her breath with a sharp,
hissing sound, and when she spoke next it
was in a cold, constrained voice.

Will will not marry me. He is married
already." . . .

At these words, the life blood seemed to
come tinoflinof and suroinc back through
Eobert Jarrett's veins. It was as if an
electric shock had been administered, which
diffusing vitality over his whole being,
snatched him from the very jaws of death.
Will married ! Dot free ! Good God ! how
different the future appeared all at once !
In the suddenness of his joy, he almost
forgot the girl's misery and despair. Then,
as he looked at her tear-stained face, a
mighty compassion made his heart swell.

How lie suffered, and he too had suffered,
and knew what unfortunate love meant.

He put out his hand in silent sympathy,
and she clasped it nervously, bowing down
her head, until he could feel the hot, salt
tears dropping one by one upon it.

Hot, dear," he said presently, " tell me
how this came about. You need not be
afraid of me."

She stooped her lips to the hand which
she held in her own, and kissed it with a
sudden impulse.

I loved him so," she said brokenly, ' I
thought him so good, and true, and noble.
1 would have stuck to him all mv
days, and not minded how poor he was, or
or what I did for him. And now it
seems as if it were n  not Will I had cared
for all these years, but some poor, contemptible
thing who w  when he got
we.Sivy of my blind adoration had not even
the courage to tell me so. But that is the

way with we poor foolish women. We
put our lovers up on such high pedestals,
that they come tumbling down with a
crash, and shatter our weak hearts to
pieces.

He let her ramble on as she liked,
knowing; that before long; she would tell
him all. He saw her smarting under the
first cruel pains of disillusion, of wounded
pride and outraged affection. It was only
natural that she should pour forth her
piteous tale incoherently, and he lay back
on his pillow, uttering a soft word of sympathy
now and again, and trying to prevent
the mad joy that possessed him from becoming
too apparent. He felt that it was
indecent  nay, selfish, yet would he have
been mortal had not his brain reeled with
intoxication at the thought that, should
God spare his life, he might now in Dot ?
Dot, whose sweet feminine disposition
revealed itself in every word !

This was the sum and substance of her
tale.

For months past Will's letters had grown
rarer and shorter. The girl treasured
them up, and never wearied of making-fresh
excuses for the writer, though her
woman's instinct told her that his love was
no longer the same as formerly. Time and
distance had cooled its ardour in a marked
deoTce. But she struocled against the

O (Do o

conviction, as would do any tender trusting
girl in her place, and flew to meet him at
the railway station, full of fluttering hope
and sweet forgiveness. At the first touch
of his lips she felt that some subtle alteration
had taken place, that, in short, an
estrangement, though none of her making,
divided them. He had hinted at confidences,
at news which it was imperative
to break, and yet maintained a torturing
reserve. His talk was chiefly about the
new practice, and how it was to be acquired,

and he succeeded in impressing Dot
with a notion that it was her duty to find
the requisite five thousand pounds, and if
she failed in coins so, the engagement
between them must be considered at an
end.

Will said he should find the money if
I didn't," sobbed poor Dot, through her
tears ; " that a man had no right to spoil
his whole career on account of an early
attachment, and hinted that there was
somebody else willing to marry him at a
moment's notice."

The brute ! " ejaculated Bob indignantly.
" Just fancy any man being
such a fool as to throw away a treasure
like YOU."

Dot sighed and wept.

I loved him so  I loved him so," she
repeated piteously. " But he was not what
I thought or he never could have acted ashe
did. If he had cared for me really, it

would have been impossible to him to
marry another woman, simply because she
had a few thousand pounds and I had not.
It is a terrible shock to discover the worthlessness
of a person you have looked up to
since your childhood. I feel as if I should
never recover from it. See, here is the
letter he sent me five days ago, every word
of which is branded on my memory in
characters of fire."

Bob, though tired, managed to read the
contents, which were as follows ;

Dear Little Dot,  When I met you at
the railway station you looked so pretty and
were evidently so glad to see me, that I could
not bring myself to tell you certain things
which you had a right to know. I am a
poor devil who has to gain his own living,
and who cannot afford to marry the girl of
his choice. Those five thousand pounds of
which we spoke were essential to my career.
VOL. III. 49

I knew that I could not look to find them
with you, and so  and so (you will think
me a beast, and God knows I feel like one)
I became engaged to a wealthy widow,
several years older than myself, who for
some rhyme or reason, appeared to have
taken a great fancy to me. When you get
this all will be over and I shall be married
to her. Dot, can you  will you forgive
rae ?  Yours in heart still, William
Barrington."

The cur ! " ejaculated Bob contemptuously.
" He is faithful, neither to the
woman he professes to love, nor to the one
he has basely married for her money.
Don't be angry with me, Dot, for saying
so, but I think you have had a lucky
escape."

She made no answer. Was it possible
that he was right ? She could not admit
the fact just at present, though her aching

heart cried out that it had been cruelly and
treacherously deceived.

This Will Barrington never could have
been worthy of you from the beginning,"
continued Bob. " A man capable of
writing such a letter as that is a poor,
mean-spirited hound."

If only he had trusted me," said Dot
bitterly, " and told me the truth, I think I
could have forgiven him everything, but
now  now," and her voice shook, '* I have
not only lost Will, but all my faith and
belief in human nature as well ; so much
has gone that never can come back."

Bob gave the hand he still held in his
own a gentle pressure.

My dear, my love," he said, " you have
indeed been cruelly treated, but don't fall
into the mistake of thinking:' that all men
are blackguards, and incapable of a true
affection. Dot, darling, if you would let
me try to restore your faith in man, I

49*

should very soon get well. It is you I
want, YOU, without whom life is unendurable."


The tears gushed afresh to her eyes.
What was this feeling stirring her heart ?
Had she turned traitor so soon . " Don't
ask anything of me now," she cried out in
alarm. "You must give me time  you
mu-t give me time."

A radiant smile lit up Bob's pale face.
Something in her tone and manner made
him hope. " I will be very, very patient,
and wait even as Jacob did for Earlier."

She drooped her head and did not
speak.

When Doctor Lankester returned from
his rounds some half-an-hour later, he
found Dot crying softly to herself and the
patient fast asleep. He felt his pulse and
turned to the girl with a look of inquiry.

"Why, Dot!" he exclaimed, "what
treatment have you been pursuing ?

Eobert Jarrett is a different man already.
He has managed to turn the corner and
wil live."

She glanced up at her father ; then
turned her blushing face away.

How could she speak to him of the
strange revolution going on within her
bosom ? How tell him that a new love
was springing up from the very ashes of
the old ?

But perhaps Dr. Lankester understood
without being told.

mm

Conclusion.

From that day Bob mended rapidly. He
had something to hope for now  a new
object in life. Nevertheless two months
went by before he regained his usual
health, and then Doctor Lankester strongly
advised his leaving England whilst the cold
spring winds Lasted. After much conversation,
it was ultimately settled between this
pair of friends that Bob should return to
Australia, in order to wind up his affairs
there, and escort his mother and sisters to
their new home. But before going on so
long a journey, he felt he must speak to
Dot ; she had been very shy and quiet of
late, and yet the small germ of hope that

had been planted in this heart whilst he lay
so ill, had gone on growing ever since.

About a fortnight prior to his departure,
he sought her out.

Dot," he said, " I am going away."

Yes," she answered in faltering tones,
I know that."

Have you nothing to say to me before
Heave?"

"What can I say ?" she demanded with
evident embarrassment.

You told me once that  that I must
give you time. I have tried and am trying
very hard still to be patient ; but Dot,
dear, if you could speak one little word
before I leave England, or give me the
least encouragement, you don't know how
happy it would make me."

She was trembling all over.

What  what  do you want  "

He advanced a step nearer, and held out
his arms with infinite yearning.

' I want you to tell me truly, if you
think you can ever get to care for me a
little bit ? I don't mean just yet. I have
no right to expect that ; but after a while
even a long while if you like it best  is
there any chance of my being able to win

you ? "

He stopped abruptly, and for a few
seconds she maintained absolute silence.

Then she becfan twitching at the corner
of her pocket-handkerchief, and at last ina
very subdued way, as if heartily ashamed
of herself, said almost in audibly, " I don't
know what you will say to me. You will
think me a most horribly capricious,
changeable person, in short no better thana
weathercock, but  but "

' But what, Dot ? For God's sake speak
out, and let me know the worst."

The small, sweet face broke up into
smiles, a dear little dimple showed on the
rounded chin, and the clear, frank eyes

looked straight into his, with an expression
which made his heart beat fast. " You
have won me already. I care for you a
very great deal as it is."

Here was an astounding discovery. Bob
could hardly believe his senses.

And Will ? " he cried sceptically, " what
about him ? "

The colour flew to her cheeks, dying
them a vivid crimson. He meant no
reproach to her constancy, but she construed
it as one.

I knew you would think poorly of me,"
she resumed humbly and apologetically.
"I think poorly of myself, and often
wonder if it is I  /, Dot Lankester, who
have changed so much in such a short
space of time. You have a perfect right
to doubt the sincerity of my affection. Appearances
are all against me. Perhaps
some girls can continue to care for a man
they no longer respect and esteem. I

could not. It was not the actual Will
Barrington I loved, but an ideal raised by
my imagination. I see it now, though at
the time I suffered tortures. Bob, I am not
really changeable and inconstant, though
probably you believe so, and if, in spite of
the past, you care to make me your wife,
I will do my best that you shall not

rei2:ret it.

Bob was wild with delight. In the first
eustace of his love, he vowed he would put
off going to Australia, and spend the
summer at Straighten Court. But Mrs.
Lankester suggested a plan which positively
fired this brain. " Why not," she
said, " get married quietly, and take Dot
out with you, as a surprise to your mother
and sisters ? There's not the least reason
for any delay." The good lady went on the
principle of striking when the iron is hot.

Bob hailed this idea rapturously. Of
course. Dot said No, when it was first

mooted to her, and, equally, of course, the
ardour of her lover and the united wishes
of her parents succeeded in removing her
objections. " Why not ? Why shouldn't
she be happy, and see a little of the world
when she got a chance ? She found it impossible
to answer that question, or to
resist the pressure put upon her.

So they were married without  any fuss
or ceremony, and a few days afterwards,
started off for Australia on their honeymoon.
Of their various adventures en route
it is unnecessary to speak. Suffice it
that Dot completely won the hearts of
her new relations, and after a delightful
stay in Bob's old home, the whole party,
with the exception of Dick, who was comfortably
installed in the farm, returned to
Straighten! Court.

Before people had fairly got over the
astonishment occasioned by Mr. Jarrett's
wedding, there came another which surprised

them still more. Lord Littelbrane
conducted Lady De Fochsey to the hymeneal
altar, thus administering a deathblow
to the already disorganised Mutual
Adorationites. Shortly after this event, his
lordship was so shocked by the behaviour
of some of his satellites, who actually left
their cards on Mrs. Jarre tt, and vowed she
was a very pretty, charming woman, that
he resigned the mastership of the Morbey
Anstead hounds in disgust. But he was
still more annoyed when Bob took them,
and by the end of his first season effected
a complete revolution in the manners and
customs of the Hunt. The new master soon
became exceedingly popular with all classes,
encouraged the presence of strangers, was
civil and pleasant to everybody, and quite
put Lord Littelbrane's nose out of joint.

But that unfortunate nobleman had
other causes of dissatisfaction. As the
years rolled on, he became a thoroughly

unhappy, dissatisfied and henpecked man,
who hated and feared his wife, without
daring to five vent to his sentiments in
her presence. He had indeed made an
unlucky venture, for sad to say. Lady
Liltelbrane disappointed expectation ; no
son and heir appeared to continue the
aristocratic race, and his theories of selection
turned out no better than theories
generally do.

By some strange, horrible and capricious
freak of Nature, the long thought of and
deeply pondered combination of beauty
and birth, health and rank, youth and
talent, failed to produce the desired results.
No little sweet, shrill voices sounded in
the Littelbrane apartments, no childish feet
could be heard pattering down the long
corridors.

Year after year his lordship's hopes
faded away, and the Castle became a scene
of many marital squabbles. 

For Lady Littelbrane did not improve with
age. She grew sharper of tongue, shorter of
temper, more restless, frivolous and vain.
She filled the house with fast young men,
mostly of the parasitic order, and carried
on bare-faced flirtations with them under
the very nose of her unhappy lord, whose
notions of social decency were terribly
shocked by such conduct. But it was
useless expressing disapproval. His wife
could master him, and knew it ; so that he
got very little domestic peace.

His chief pleasure consisted in creeping
out to dine with old General Prosiebov
whilst she was entertaining some of her
gay acquaintances at home.

Sad to relate, that staunch Warrior had
made friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness,
although after a bottle of
wine he would still converse fluently about
the departed glory of the Mutual .


For their sun was on the wane. The
M.A.'s, indeed, almost ceased to exist. The
majority had gone over to the enemy, and
pretty Mrs. Eobert Jarrett made many converts
amongst their ranks. Her kindliness,
cheeriness and sweet simplicity were hard to
resist. Even the ladies, who at first turned
up their noses at Dot, as " a little country
doctor's daughter," were forced in time to
admit that she was " quite a nice, refined
and altogether unobjectionable person."

And Bob ? Our honest, out-spoken,
manly, rough Australian of the big heart
and unpolished manners ?

It may please some to hear that he was
very happy with this little wife, and that
they both considered their good fortune
should make them extra tender to others,
less lucky than themselves.

There is not such another pair of matchmakers
in the county.

What between looking after his estate,

his hounds and his children, Bob has plenty
of good honest employment, which saves
him from sinking down into a mere selfish
and luxurious Sybarite, intent upon
nothing but gratifying his own wants and
wishes.

Possibly, the sharp lesson he received
from a small section of English gentlemen
on his first arrival in England, though not
pleasant at the time, had a salutary effect,
and taught him that even in the mother
country there are a good many things net
worthy of imitation. He may have learnt
that to be kind and charitable, unselfish
and unaffected, make a man a finer gentleman
than possessing smart clothes, having a

bitter tongue, and an inordinate opinion of
I I I.
