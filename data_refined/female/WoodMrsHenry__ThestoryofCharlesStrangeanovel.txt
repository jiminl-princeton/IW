Chapter I.

ON THE WATCH,

K. SERJEANT STILLINGFAR

sat at dinner in his house in
Russell Square one Sunday afternoon.
A great cause, in which he was to
lead, had brought him up from circuit, to
which he would return when the Nisi Prius
trial was over. The cloth was beings removed
when I entered. He received me
with his usual kindly welcome.

Why not have come to dinner, Charles ?
VOL. III. 39

Just had it, you say ? All the more reason
why we might have had it together. Sit
down, and help yourself to wine."

Declining the wine, I drew my chair
near to his, and told him what I had come
about.

A few days had gone on since the last
chapter. With the trouble connected with
Mrs. Brightman, and the trouble connected
with Tom Heriot, I had enough on
my mind at that time, if not ujoon my
shoulders. As regarded Mrs. Brightman,
no one could help me ; but regarding the
other

Was Tom in London, or was he not ?
How was I to find out ? I had again gone
prowling about the book-stall and its environs,
and had seen no trace of him. Had
Leah really seen him, or only some other
man who resembled him ?

Again I questioned Leah. Her opinion
was not to be shaken. She held emphatically
to her assertion. It was Tom that she had
seen, and none other.

You may have seen some other sailor,
sir ; I don't say to the contrary ; but the
sailor I saw was Captain Heriot," she reiterated.
" Suppose I go again to-night,
sir ? I may, perhaps, have the good luck to
see him."

Should you call it good luck, Leah ?"

' Ah well, sir, you know what I mean,"
she answered. '' Shall I go to-night ?"

No, Leah ; I am going myself. I cannot
rest in this uncertainty."

Rest ! I felt more like a troubled spirit
or a wandering ghost. Arthur Lake asked
what had efone wrongs with me, and where I
disappeared to of an evening.

Once more I turned out in discarded
clothes to saunter about Lambeth. It was
Saturday night and the thoroughfares were
crowded ; but amidst all who came and went
I saw no trace of Tom.

Worried, disheartened, I determined to
carry the perplexity to my Uncle Stillingfar.
That he was true as steel, full of loving-kindness
to all the world, no matter what

392

their errors, and that he would aid me with
his counsel  if any counsel could avail  I
well knew. And thus I found myself at his
house on that Sunday afternoon. Of course
he had heard about the escape of the convicts
; had seen Tom's name in the list ; but
he did not know that he was suspected of
having reached London. I told him of what
Leah had seen, and added the little episode
about ' Miss Betsy."

' And now, what can be done, Uncle
Stillingfar ? I have come to ask you."

His kindly blue eyes became thoughtful
whilst he pondered the question. " Indeed,
Charles, I know not," he answered. " Either
you must wait in patience until he turns up
some fine day  as he is sure to do if he is in
London  or you must quietly pursue your
search for him, and smuggle him away when
you have found him."

But if I don't find him ? Do you think
it could be Tom that Leah saw ? Is it possible
that he can be in London ?"

Quite possible. If a homeward vessel,

bound, it may be, for the port of London,
picked them up, what more likely than that
he is here ? Again, who else would call
himself Charles Strange, and pass himself off
for you ? Though I cannot see his motive
for doing it."

' Did you ever know any man so recklessly
imprudent, uncle ?"

'' I have never known any man so reckless
as Tom Heriot. You must do your best to
find him, Charles."

I don't know how. I thought you might
possibly have suggested some plan. Everyday
increases his danger."

It does : and the chances of his being
recognised."

It seems useless to search further in
Lambeth : he must have changed his quarters.
And to look about London for him will belike
looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.
I suppose," I slowly added, " it would not do
to employ a detective ?"

Not unless you wish to put him into
the lion's mouth," said the Serjeant. " Why,

Charles, it would be his business to retake
him. Rely upon it, the police are now looking
for him if they have the slightest suspicion
that he is here."

At that time one or two private detectives
had started in business on their own account,
having nothing to do with the police : now
they have sprung up in numbers. It was to
these I alluded.

Serjeant Stillingfar shook his head. " I
would not trust one of them, Charles : it
would be too dangerous an experiment.
No ; what you do, you must do yourself.
Once let Government get scent that he is
here, and we shall probably find the walls
placarded with a reward for his apprehension."

One thing I am surprised at," I said as
I rose to leave :  that if he is here, he
should not have let me know it. What can
he be doing for money ? An escaped convict
is not likely to have much of that about
him."

Serjeant Stillingfar shook his head.
There are points about the affair that I

cannot fathom, Charles. Talking of money
you are well-off now, but if more than
you can spare should be needed to get Tom
Heriot away, apply to me."

Thank you, uncle ; but I don't think it
will be needed. Where would you recommend
him to escape to ?"

'find him first," was the Serjeant's answer.

He accompanied me himself to the front
door. As we stood, speaking a last word, a
middle-aged man, with keen eyes and spare
frame, dressed as a workman, came up with
a brisk step. Mr. Serjeant Stillingfar met
the smile on the man's face as he glanced up
in passing.

Arkwright !" he exclaimed. " I hardly
knew you. Some sharp case in hand, I
conclude ?"

Just so, Serjeant ; but I hope to bring
it to earth before the day's over. You
know "

Then the man glanced at me and came to
a pause.

However, I mustn't talk about it noW;

SO good-afternoon, Serjeant." And thus
speaking, he walked briskly onwards.

I wonder what he has in hand ? I
think he would have told me, Charles, but
for your being present," cried my uncle, looking
after him. " A keen man is Arkwright."

Arhwriglit /" I echoed, the name now
impressing itself upon me. " Surely not
Arkwright the famous detective !"

Yes, it is. And he has evidently got
himself up as a workman to further some
case that he has in hand. He knew you,
Charles ; depend upon that ; though you
did not know him."

A fear, perhaps a foolish one, fell upon
me. " Uncle Stillingfar," I breathed, " can
his case be Toms Think you it is he who
is being run to earth ?"

'' No, no. That is not likely," he answered,
after a moment's consideration.
Anyway, you must use every exertion to
find him, for his stay in London is full of
danger."

It will readily be believed that this incident

had not added to my peace of mind.
One more visit I decided to pay to the old
ground in Lambeth, and after that  why,
in truth, whether to turn east, west, north
or south, I knew no more than the dead.

Monday was bright and frosty ; Monday
evening clear, cold and starlight. The gaslights
flared away in the streets and shops ;
the roads were lined with wayfarers.

Sauntering down the narrow pavement on
the opposite side of the way, in the purposeless
manner that a hopeless man favours, I
approached the book-stall. A sailor was
standing before it, his head bent over the
volumes. Every pulse within me went upto
fever heat : for there was that in him
that reminded me of Tom Heriot.

I crossed quietly to the stall, stood side
by side with him, and took up a handful of
penny dreadful. Yes, it was he  Tom Heriot.

'' Tom," I cried softly. " Tom !"

I felt the start he gave. But he did not
move hand or foot ; only his eyes turned toscan
me.

Tom," I whispered again, apparently
intent upon a grand picture of a castle inflames,
and a gentleman miraculously escaping
with a lady from an attic window.
Tom, don't you know me ?"

For goodness' sake don't speak to me,
Charley !" he breathed in answer, the words
barely audible. ' Go away, for the love of
heaven ! I've been a prisoner here for the
last three minutes. That policeman yonder
would know me, and I dare not turn. His
name's Wren."

Three doors off, a policeman was standing
at the edge of the pavement, facing the
shops, as if waiting to pounce upon someone
he was expecting to pass. Even as Tom
spoke, he wheeled round to the right, and
marched up the street. Tom as quickly
disappeared to the left, leaving a few words
in my ear.

I'll wait for you at the other end,
Charley ; it is darker there than here.
Don't follow me immediately."

So I remained where I was, still bending

an enraptured gaze upon the burning castle
and the gallant knight and damsel escaping
from it at their peril.

* Betsy says the account comes to seven
shillings, Mr. Strange."

The address gave me almost as great a
thrill as the sight of Tom had done. It
came from the man Lee, now emerging
from his shop. Involuntarily I pulled my
hat lower upon my brow. He looked up
and down the street.

'' Oh, I beg pardon  thought Mr. Strange
was standing here," he said. And then I
saw my error. He had not spoken to me,
but to Tom Heriot. My gaze was still
fascinated by the flaming picture.

' Anything you'd like this evening,
sir ?"

' I'll take this sheet  half a dozen of
them," I said, putting down sixpence.

Thank you, sir. A fine night."

Yes, very. Were you speaking to the
sailor who stood here ?" I added carelessly
 He went off in that direction, I think,"

pointing to the one opposite to that Tom
had taken.

Yes," answered the man ; '' 'twas Mr.
Strange. He had asked me to look how
much his score was for tobacco. I dare say
he'll be back presently. Captain Strange,
by rights," added Lee chastity.

Oh ! Captain of a vessel ?"

'' Of his own vessel  a yacht. Not but
what he has been about the world in vessels
of all sorts, he tells us ; one voyage before
the mast, the next right up next to the
skipper. But for them ujds and downs whereas
he says, would sailors find their experience
f

Very true. Well, this is all I want
just now. Good-evening."

Good-evening, sir," replied Caleb Lee.

The end of the street to which Tom had
pointed was destitute of shops ; the houses
were small and poor ; consequently, it was
tolerably dark. Tom was sauntering along,
smoking a short pipe.

Is there any place at hand where we

can have a few words together in tolerable
security ?" I asked.

Come along," briefly responded Tom.
You walk on the other side of the street,
old fellow ; keep me in view."

It was good advice, and I took it. He
increased his pace to a brisk walk, and presently
turned down a narrow passage, which
brought him to a sort of small, triangular
green, planted with shrubs and trees. I
followed, and we sat down on one of the
benches.

'' Are you quite mad, Tom ?"

Not mad a bit," laughed Tom. '' I say,
Charley, did you come to that book-stall to
look after me ?"

Ay. And it's about the tenth time I
have been there."

How the dickens did you find me out ?"

Chance one evening took Leah into the
neighbourhood, and she happened to see you.
I had feared you might be in England."

You had heard of the wreck of the
Vengeance, I suppose ; and that a few of us

had escaped. Good old Leah ! Did I give
her a fright ?"

We were sitting side by side. Tom had
put his pipe out, lest the light should catch
the sight of any passing stragglers. We
spoke in whispers. It was, perhaps, as safe
a place as could be found ; nevertheless, I
sat upon thorns.

Not so Tom. By the few signs that
might be gathered  his light voice, his gay
laugh, his careless manner  Tom felt as
happy and secure as if he had been attending
one of her Majesty's levees, in the full
glory of scarlet coat and flashing sword-blade.

Do you know, Tom, you have half
killed me with terror and apprehension ?
How could you be so reckless as to come
back to London ?"

Because the old ship brought me,"
lif>"htlv returned Tom.

I suppose a vessel picked you up  and
the comrades who escaped with you ?"

It picked two of us up. The other
three died."

What, in the boat ?"

He nodded. " In the open boat at sea."

How did you manage to escape ? I
thought convicts were too well looked
after."

*' So they are, under ordinary circumstances.
Shipwrecks form the exception.
I'll give you the history, Charley."

*' Make it brief, then. I am upon thorns."

Tom laughed, and began :

' We were started on that blessed voyage,
a cargo of men in irons, and for some time
made a fair passage, and thought we must
be nearing the other side. Such a crew,
that cargo, Charles I Such an awful lot !
Villainous wretches, who wore their guilt on
their faces, and suffered their deserts ; half
demons, most of them. A few amongst
them were no doubt like me, innocent enough:
wrongfully accused and condemned "

But go on with the narrative, Tom."

* I swear I was innocent," he cried, with
emotion, heedless of my interruption. " I
was wickedly careless, I admit that, but the

guilt was another's, not mine. When I put
those bills into circulation, Charles, I knew
no more they were forged than you did.
Don't you believe me ?"

"I do believe you. I have believed you
throughout."

And if the trial had not been hurried
on I think it could have been proved. It
was hurried on, Charles, and when it was
on it was hurried over. I am suffering
unjustly."

Yes, Tom. But won't you go on with
your story ?"

' Where was I ? Oh, about the voyage
and the shipwreck. After getting out of
the south-east trades, we had a fortnight's
light winds and calms, and then got into a
steady westerly wind, before which we ran
quietly for some days. One dark night, it
was the fifteenth of November, and thick,
drizzling weather, the wind about north-west,
we had turned in and were in our first sleep,
when a tremendous uproar arose on deck ;
the watch shouting and tramping, the

officers' orders and the boatswain's mate's
shrill piping rising above the din. One might
have thought Old Nick had leaped on board
and was giving chase. Next came distinctly
that fearful cry, ' All hands save ship !'
Sails were being clewed up, yards were
being swung round. Before we could realize
what it all meant, the ship had run ashore ;
and there she stuck, bumping as if she would
knock her bottom out."

Get on, Tom," I whispered, for he had
paused, and seemed to be spinning a long
yarn instead of a short one.

Fortunately, the ship soon made a sort
of cradle for herself in the sand, and lay on
her starboard bilge. To attempt to get her
off was hopeless. So they got us all out of
the ship and on shore, and put us under
tents made of the sails. The skipper made
out, or thought he made out, the island to
be that of Tristan d'Acunha : whether it
was or not I can't say positively. At first
we thought it was uninhabited, but it turned
out to have a few natives on it, sixty or

VOL. III. 40

eighty in all. In the course of a few days
every movable thing had been landed. All
the boats were intact, and were moored in a
sort of creek, or small natural harbour, their
gear, sails and oars in them."

Hush !" I breathed, " or you are
lost !"

A policeman's bull's-eye was suddenly
turned upon the grass. By the man's size,
I knew him for Tom's friend, Wren. We
sat motionless. The light just escaped us,
and the man passed on. But we had been
in danger.

If you would only be quicker, Tom. I
don't want to know about boats and their
gear."

He laughed. " How impatient you are,
Charles ! Well, to get on ahead. A cargo
of convicts cannot be kept as securely under
such circumstances as had befallen us as they
could be in a ship's hold, and the surveillance
exercised was surprisingly lax. Two or three
of the prisoners were meditating an escape,
and thought they saw their way to effecting

it by means of one of the boats. I found
this out, and joined the party. But there
were almost insurmountable difficulties in the
way. It was absolutely necessary that we
should put on ordinary clothes  for what
vessel, picking us up, but would have delivered
us up at the first port it touched at,
had we been in convict dress ? We marked
the purser's slop-chest, which was under a
tent, and well filled, and "

Do get on, Tom !"

Here goes, then 1 One calm, but dark
night, when other people were sleeping, we
stole down to the creek, five of us, rigged
ourselves out in the purser's toggery, leaving
the Government uniforms in exchange, unmoored
one of the cutters, and got quietly
away. We had secreted some bread and
salt meat ; water there had been already onboard.
The wind was ofi" the land, and we
let the boat drift before it a bit before attempting
to make sail. By daylight we
were far enough from the island ; no chance
of their seeing us  a sjeck on the waters.

4  2

The wind, hitherto south, had backed to the
westward. We shaped a course by the sun
to the eastward, and sailed along at the rate
of five or six knots. My comrades were
not as rough as they might have been ;
rather decent fellows for convicts. Two of
them were from Essex ; had been sentenced
for poaching only. Now began our lookout
: constantly straining our eyes along the
horizon for a sail, but especially astern for
an outward-bounder, but only saw one or
two in the distance that did not see us.
What I underwent in that boat as day after
day passed, and no sail appeared, I won't
enter upon now, old fellow. The provisions
were exhausted, and so was the water. Oneby
one three of my companions went crazy
and died. The survivor and I had consigned
the last of them to the deep on the twelfth
day, and then I thought my turn had come ;
but Markham was worse than I was. How
many hours went on, I knew not. I lay at
the bottom of the boat, exhausted and half
unconscious, when suddenly I heard voices.

J imagined it to be a dream. But in a few
minutes a boat was alongside the cutter, and
two of its crew had stepped over and were
raising me up. They spoke to me, but I
was too weak to understand or answer ; in
fact, I was delirious. I and Markham were
taken on board and put to bed. After some
days, passed in a sort of dreamy, happy
delirium, well cared for and attended to, I
woke up to the realities of life. Markham
was dead : he had never revived, and died
of exposure and weakness some hours after
the rescue."

What vessel had picked you up ?"
It was the Discovery, a whaler belonging
to Whitby, and homeward bound. The
captain. Van Hoppe, was Dutch by birth,
but had been reared in England and had
always sailed in English ships. A good and
kind fellow, if ever there was one. Of
course, I had to make my tale good and
suppress the truth. The passenger-ship in
which I was sailing to Australia to seek my
fortune had foundered in mid-ocean, and

those who escaped with me had died of their
sufferings. That was true so far. Captain
Van Hoppe took up my misfortunes warmly.
Had he been my own brother  had he been
you, Charley  he could not have treated me
better or cared for me more. The vessel had
a prosperous run home. She was bound for
the port of London ; and when I put my
hand into Van Hoppe's at parting, and tried
to thank him for his goodness, he left a
twenty-pound note in it. ' You'll need it,
Mr. Strange,' he said ; ' you can repay me
when your fortune's made and you are rich.' "

Strange /" I cried.

Tom laughed.

I called myself ' Strange ' on the whaler.
Don't know that it was wise of me. One
day when I was getting better and lay deep
in thought  which just then chanced to be
of you, Charley  the mate suddenly asked
me what my name was. ' Strange,' I
answered, on the spur of the moment. That's
how it was. And that's the brief history of
my escape."

You have had money, then, for your
wants since you landed," I remarked.

I have had the twenty pounds. It's
coming to an end now."

'' You ought not to have come to London.
You should have got the captain to put you
ashore somewhere, and then made your
escape from England."

All very fine to talk, Charley ! I had
not a sixpence in my pocket, or any idea
that he was going to help me. I could only
come on as far as the vessel would bring me."

* And suppose he had not given you
money  what then ?"

Then I must have contrived to let you
know that I was home again, and borrowed
from you," he lightly replied.

"Well, your being here is frightfully
dangerous."

Not a bit of it. As long as the police
don't suspect I am in England, they won't
look after me. It's true that a few of them
might know me, but I do not think they
would in this guise and with my altered face."

You were afraid of one to-night."

'' Well, he is especially one who might
know me ; and he stood there so long that I
began to think he might be watching me.
Anyway, I've been on shore these three
weeks, and nothing has come of it yet."

What about that young lady named
Betsy ? Miss Betsy Lee."

Tom threw himself back in a fit of
laughter.

'' I hear the old fellow went down to
Essex Street one night to ascertain whether
I lived there ! The girl asked me one day
where I lived, and I rapped out Essex
Street."

But, Tom, what have you to do with
the girl ?"

Nothing ; nothing. On my honour. I
have often been in the shop, sometimes of
an evening. The father has invited me to
some grog in the parlour behind it, and I
have sat there for an hour chatting with
him and the girl. That's all. She is a well-behaved,
modest little girl ; none better."

Well, Tom, with one imprudence and
another, you stand a fair chance "

There, there ! Don't preach, Charley.
What you call imprudence, I call fun."

What do you think of doing ? To remain
on here for ever in this disguise ?"

'' Couldn't, I expect, if I wanted to. I
must soon see about getting away."

'' You must get away at once."

I am not going yet, Charley ; take my
word for that ; and I am as safe in London,
I reckon, as I should be elsewhere. Don't
say but I may have to clear out of this
particular locality. If that burly policeman
is going to make a permanent beat of it
about here, he might drop upon me some
fine evening."

And you must exchange your sailor's
disguise, as you call it, for a better
one."

Perhaps so. That rough old coat you
have on, Charley, might not come amiss
to me."

You can have it. Why do you fear

that policeman should know you, more than
any other ?"

He was present at the trial last August.
Was staring me in the face most of the day.
His name's Wren."

I sighed.

Well, Tom, it is getting late ; we have
sat here as long as is consistent with safety,"
I said, rising.

He made me sit down again.

' The later the safer, perhaps, Charley.
When shall we meet again ?"

Ay ; when, and where ?"

* Come tomorrow evening, to this same
spot. It is as good a one as any I know
of I shall remain indoors all day tomorrow.
Of course one does not care to run
needlessly into danger. Shall you find your
way to it ?"

' Yes, and will be here ; but I shall go
now. Do be cautious, Tom. Do you want
any money ? I have brought some with
me.

'' Man thanks, old fellow ; I've enough

to go on with for a day or two. How is

Blanche ? Did she nearly die of the disgrace

f

' She did not know of it. Does not know

it yet."

No !" he exclaimed in astonishment.
Why, how can it have been kept from
her ? She does not live in a wood."

Level has managed it, somehow. She
was abroad dining the trial, you know.
They have chiefly lived there since, Blanche
seeing no English newspapers ; and, of
course, her acquaintances do not gratuitously
speak to her about it. But I don't think it
can be kept from her much longer."

'' But where does she think I am  all
this time ?"

'' She thinks you are in India with the
regiment."

'' I suppose he was in a fine way about it !"

Level ? Yes  naturally ; and is still.
He would have saved you, Tom, at any
cost."

As you would, and one or two more

good friends ; but, you see, I did not know
what was coming ujon me in time to ask
them. It fell upon my head like a thunderbolt.
Level is not a bad fellow at bottom."

He is a downright good one  at least,
that's my opinion of him."

We stood hand locked in hand at parting.
" Where are you staying ?" I whispered.

Xot far off. I've a lodging in the neighbourhood
 one room."

Fare you well, then, until tomorrow
evening."

Au re voir, Charley."

TOM HERIOT.

Found my way straight enough
the next night to the Httle green
with its trees and shrubs. Tom
was there, and was humming one of our
boyhood's songs taught us by Leah :

Young Henry was as brave a youth
As ever graced a martial story ;
And Jane was fair as lovely truth :
She sighed for love, and he for glory.

*' To her his faith he meant to plight,
And told her many a gallant story :
But war, their honest joys to blight,
Called him away from love to glory.

Young Henry met the foe with pride ;

Jane followed  fought ah ! hapless story !
In man's attire, by Henry's side.
She died for love, and he for glory. '

He was still dressed as a sailor, but the
pilot-coat was buttoned up high and tight
about his throat, and the round glazed hat
was worn upon the front of his head instead
of the back of it.

I thought you meant to change these
things, Tom," I said as we sat down.

' All in good time," he answered ; " don't
quite know yet what costume to adopt.
Could one become a negro-melody man,
think you, Charley  or a Red Indian juggler
with balls and sword-swallowing ?"

How light he seemed ! how supremely
indifferent ! Was it real or only assumed ?
Then he turned suddenly upon me :

'' I say, what are you in black for,
Charley ? For my sins ?"

'' For Mr. Brightman."

Mr. Brightman !" he repeated, his tone
changing to one of concern. " Is he
dead ?"

*' He died the last week in February.
Some weeks ago now. Died quite suddenly."

Well, well, well 1" softly breathed Tom

Heriot. " I am very sorry. I did not
know it. But how am I likely to know
anything of what the past months have
brought forth ?"

It would serve no purpose to relate the
interview of that night in detail. We spent
it partly in quarrelling. That is, in differences
of opinion. It was impossible to convince
Tom of his danger. I told him about
the Sunday incident, when Detective Arkwright
passed the door of Serjeant ,
and my momentary fear that he
might be looking after Tom. He only
laughed. " Good old Uncle Stillingfar !"
cried he ; "give my love to him." And all
his conversation was carried on in the same
light strain.

' But you must leave Lambeth," I urged.
You said you would do so."

I said I might. I will, if I see just
cause for doing so. Plenty of time yet. I
am not sure, you know, Charles, that Wren
would know me."

'' The very fact of your leaving called

yourself ' Strange ' ought to take you aYay
from here."

Well, I suppose that was a bit of a mistake,"
he acknowledged. '' But look here,
brother mine, your own fears mislead you.
Until it is known that I have made my way
home no one will be likely to look after me.
Behaving me to be at the antipodes, they
won't search London for me."

' They may suspect that you are in London,
if they don't actually know it."

'' Xot they. To begin with, it must bea
matter of absolute uncertainty whether
we got picked up at all, after escaping from
the island ; but the natural conclusion will
be that, if we were, it was by a vessel bound
for the colonies : homeward-bound ships do
not take that comes. Everyone at all acquainted
with navigation knows that. I
assure you, our being found by the whaler
was the merest chance in the world. Be at
ease, Charley. I can take care of myself,
and I Avill leave Lambeth if necessary. One
of these fine mornings you may get a note



from me, telling you I have emigrated to
the Isle of Dogs, or some such enticing
quarter, and have become ' Mr. Smith
Meanwhile, we can meet here occasionally."

I don't like this place, Tom. It must
inevitably be attended with more or less
danger. Had I not better come to your
lodgings ?"

' No," he replied, after a moment's consideration.
'' I am quite sure that we are
safe here, and there it's hot and stifling  a
dozen families living in the same house.
And I shall not tell you where the lodgings
are, Charles : you might be swooping down
upon me to carry me away as Mephistopheles
carried away Dr. Faustus."

After supplying him with money, with a
last handshake, whispering a last injunction
to be cautious, I left the triangle, and left
him within it. The next moment found me
face to face with the burly frame and wary
glance of Mr. Policemen Wren. He was
standing still in the starlight. I walked
past him with as much unconcern as I could

VOL. III. 41

muster. He turned to look after me for a
time, and then continued his beat.

It gave me a scare. What would be the
result if Tom met him unexpectedly as I
had done ? I would have given half I was
worth to hover about and ascertain. But I
had to go on my way.

' Can you see Lord Level, sir ?"
It was the following Saturday afternoon,
and I was just starting for Hastings. The
week had passed in anxious labour. Business
cares for me, more work than I knew
how to get through, for Lennard was away
ill, and constant mental torment about Tom.
I took out my watch before answering Watts.
Yes, I have five minutes to spare. If
that will be enough for his lordship," I
added, laughing, as we shook hands : for he
had followed Watts into the room.
' You are off somewhere, Charles ?"
Yes, to Hastings. I shall be back
again tomorrow night. Can I do anything
for you ?"

'' Nothing," replied Lord Level. '' I came
up from Marshdale this morning, and thought
I would come round this afternoon to ask
whether you have any news."

When Lord Level went to Marshdale on
the visit that bore so suspicious an aspect to
his wife, he had remained there only one
night, returning to London the following
day. This week he had been down again,
and stayed rather longer  two days, in fact.
Blanche, as I chanced to know, was rebelling
over it. Secretly rebelling, for she had not
brought herself to accuse him openly.

' News ?" I repeated.

Of Tom Heriot."

Should I tell Lord Level ? Perhaps there
was no help for it. When he had asked me
before I had known nothing positively ; now
I knew only too much.

Why I should have it, I know not ; buta
conviction lies upon me that he has found
his way back to London," he continued.
*' Charles, you look conscious. Do you
know anything ?"

412

* You are right. He is here, and I have
seen him."

Good heavens !" exclaimed Lord Level,
throwing himself back in his chair. '' Has
he really been mad enough to come back to
London ?"

Drawing my own chair nearer to him, I
bent forward, and in low tones gave him briefly
the history. I had seen Tom on the Monday
and Tuesday nights, as already related
to the reader. On the Thursday night I
was again at the trysting-place, but Tom did
not meet me. The previous night, Friday, I
had gone again, and again Tom did not
appear.

Is he taken, think you ?" cried Lord
Level.

I don't know : and you see I dare not
make any inquiries. But I think not. Had
he been captured, it would be in the passers."

I am not so sure of that. What an
awful thing ! What suspense for us all !
Can nothing be done ?"

Nothing," I answered, rising, for my

time was up. " We can only wait, and
watch, and be silent."

"If it were not for the disgrace reflected
upon us, and raking it up again to people's
minds, I would say let him be re-taken ! It
would serve him right for his foolhardiness."

How is Blanche ?"

Cross and snappish ; unaccountably so :
and showing her temper to me rather unbearably."


I laughed  willing to treat the matter
lightly. " She does not care that you
should go travelling without her, I take it."

Lord Level, who was passing out before
me, turned and gazed into my face.

"Yes," said he emphatically. "But a
man may have matters to take up his attention,
and his movements also, that he may
deem it inexpedient to talk of to his wife."

He spoke with a touch of haughtiness.
"Very true," I murmured, as we shook
hands and went out together, he walking away
towards Gloucester Place, I jumping into the
cab waiting to take me to the station.

Mrs. Brightman was better ; I knew
that ; and showing herself more self-controlled.
But there was no certainty that the
improvement would be lasting. In truth,
the certainty lay rather the other way.
Her mother's home was no home for Annabel
; and I had formed the resolution to ask
her to come to mine.

The sun had set when I reached Hastings,
and Miss Brightman's house. Miss Bright-man,
who seemed to grow less strong day
by day, which I was grieved to hear, was in
her room lying down. Annabel sat at the
front drawing-room window in the twilight.
She started up at my entrance, full of surprise
and apprehension.

Oh, Charles ! Has anything happened ?
Is mamma worse ?"

No, indeed ; your mamma is very much
better," said I cheerfully. " I have taken a
run down for the pleasure of seeing you,
Annabel."

She still looked uneasy. I remembered the
dreadful tidings I had brought the last time

I came to Hastings. No doubt she was
thinking of it, too, poor girl.

Take a seat, Charles," she said. ' Aunt
Lucy will soon be down."

I drew a chair opposite to her, and talked
for a little time on indifferent topics. The
twilight shades grew deeper, passers-by more
indistinct, the sea less bright and shimmering.
Silence stole over us  a sweet silence all too
conscious, all too fleeting. Annabel suddenly
rose, stood at the window, and made some
slight remark about a little boat that was
nearing the pier.

'' Annabel," I whispered, as I rose and
stood by her, " you do not know what I
have really come down for."

No," she answered, with hesitation.

When I last saw you at your own home,
you may remember that you were in very
great trouble. I asked you to share it with
me, but you would not do so."

She began to tremble, and became agitated,
and I passed my arm round her waist.

My darling, I now know all."

Her heart beat violently as I held her.
Her hand shook nervously m mine.

'' You cannot know all !" she cried
piteously.

'' I know all ; more than you do. Mrs.
Brightman was worse after you left, and
Hatch sent for me. She and Mr. Close
have told me the whole truth."

Annabel would have shrunk away, in the
full tide of shame that swept over her, and
a low moan broke from her lips.

Nay, my dear, instead of shrinking from
me, you must come nearer to me  for ever.
My home must be yours now."

She did not break away from me, and
stood pale and trembling, her hands clasped,
her emotion strong.

It cannot, must not be, Charles."

Hush, my love. It can be  and shall
be."

'' Charles," she said, her very lips trembling,
' weigh well what you are saying.
Do not suffer the  affection  I must speak
fully  the implied engagement that was

between us, ere this unhappiness came to
my knowledge and yours  do not suffer it
to bind you now. It is a fearful disgrace
to attach to my poor mother, and it is reflected
upon me."

Were your father living, Annabel, should
you say the disgrace was also reflected U2:)on
him r

 Oh no, no. I could not do so. My good
father ! honourable and honoured. Never
upon him."

I laughed a little at her want of logic.

Annabel, my dear, you have yourself
answered the question. As I hold you to
my heart now, so will I, in as short a time
as may be, hold you in my home and at my
hearth. Let what will betide, you shall
have one true friend to shelter and protect
you with his care and love for ever and forever."


Her tears were falling.

Oh please, please, Charles ! I am sure
it ought not to be. Aunt Lucy would tell
you so."

Aunt Lucy came in at that moment, and
proved to be on my side. She would be
going to Madeira at the close of the summer,
and the difficulty as to what was to be done
then with Annabel had begun to trouble her
greatly.

I cannot take her with me, you see,
Charles," she said. " In her mother's precarious
state, the child must not absent herself
from England. Still less can I leave
her to her mother's care. Therefore I think
your proposal exactly meets the dilemma. I
suppose matters have been virtually settled
between you for some little time now."

Oh, Aunt Lucy!" remonstrated Annabel,
blushing furiously.

Well, my dear, and I say it is all for the
best. If you can suggest a better plan I am
willing to hear it.'

Annabel sat silent, her head drooping.

I may tell you this much, child : your
father looked forward to it and approved it.
Not that he would have allowed the marriage
to take place just yet had he lived ; I am

sure of that ; but he is not having, and circumstances
alter cases."

I am sure he liked me, Miss Brightman,"
I ventured to put in, as modestly as I could ;
' and I believe he would have consented to
our marriage."

* Yes, he liked you very much ; and so do
I," she added, laughing. " I wish I could
say as much for Mrs. Brightman. The opposition,
I fancy, will come from her."

' You think she will oppose it ?" I said 
and, indeed, the doubt had lain in my own
mind.

I am afraid so. Of course there will be
nothing for it but patience. Annabel cannot
marry without her consent."

How a word will turn the scales of our
hopes and fears ! That Mrs. Brightman
would oppose and wither our bright prospects
came to me in that moment with the
certainty of conviction.

Come what come may, we will be true
to each other," I whispered to Annabel the
next afternoon. We were standing at the

end of the pier, looking out upon the calm
sea, flashing in the sunshine, and I imprisoned
her hand momentarily in mine.
' If we have to exercise all the patience
your Aunt Lucy spoke of, we will still hope
on, and put our trust in Heaven."

Even so, Charles." The evening was
yet early when I reached London, and I
walked home fiom the station. St. Mary's
was striking half-past seven as I passed it.
At the self-same moment, an arm was inserted
into mine. I turned quickly, wondering
if anyone had designs upon my small
hand-bag.

All right, Charley ! I'm not a burglar."

It was only Lake. " Why, Arthur ! I
thought you had gone to Oxford until
Monday !"

Got news last night that the fellow
could not have me : had to go down somewhere
or other," he answered, as we walked
along arm-in-arm. " I say, I had a bit of a
scare just now."

'' In what way ?"

'' I thought I saw Tom pass. Tom
Heriot," he added in a whisper.

'' Oh, but that's impossible, you know.
Lake," I said, though I felt my pulses
quicken. ' All your fancy."

It was just under that gas-lamp at the
corner of Wellington Street," Lake went on.
' He was sauntering along as if he had
nothing to do, muffled in a coat that looked
a mile too big for him, and a red comforter.
He lifted his face in passing, and stopped
suddenly, as if he had recognised me, and
were going to speak ; then seemed to think
better of it, turned on his heel and walked
back the way he had been coming. Charley,
if it was not Tom Heriot, I never saw such
a likeness as that man bore to him."

My lips felt glued. " It could not have
been Tom Heriot, Lake. You know Tom
is at the antipodes. We will not talk of
him, please. Are you coming home with
me (

' Yes. I was going on to Barlow's
Chambers, but I'll come with you instead."

AN EVENING VISITOR.

jlpHE spring flowers were showing
themselves, and the may was
budding in the hero-es. I thought
how charming it all looked, as I turned, this
Monday afternoon, into Mrs. Brightman's
grounds, where laburnums drooped their
graceful blossoms, and lilacs filled the air
with their perfume ; how significantly it all
spoke to the heart of renewed life after
the gloom of winter, the death and decay of
nature.

Mrs. Brightman was herself, enjoying the
spring-tide. She sat, robed in crape, on a
bench amidst the trees, on which the sun

was shining. What a refined, proud, handsome
face was hers ! but pale and somewhat
haggard now. No other trace of her recent
illness was apparent, except a nervous
trembling of the hands.

' This is a surprise," she said, holding out
one of those hands to me quite cordially. " I
thought you had been too busy of late to
visit me in the day-time."

' Generally I am very busy, but I made
time to come to-day. I have something of
importance to say to you, Mrs. Brightman.
Will you hear me ?"

She paused to look at me  a searching,
doubtful look. Did she fear that I was
about to speak to her of her failing ? The
idea occurred to me.

' Certainly," she coldly replied. '' Business
must, of course, be attended to. Would
you prefer to go indoors or to sit out here ?"

'' I would rather remain here. I am not
often favoured with such a combination of
velvet lawn and sunshine and sweet scents."

She made room for me beside her. And,

with as little circumlocution as possible, I
brought out what I wanted  Annabel.
When the heart is truly engaged, a man at
these moments can only be bashful, especially
when he sees it will be an uphill fight ;
but if the heart has nothing to do with
the matter, he can be as cool and suave as
though he were merely telling an everyday
story.

Mrs. Brightman, hearing me to the end,
rose haughtily.

Surely you do not know what you are
saying !" she exclaimed. " Or is it that I
fail to understand you ? You cannot be
asking for the hand of my daughter ?"

'' Indeed  pardon me  I am. Mrs.
Brightman, we "

Pardon me/ she interrupted, " but I
must tell you that it is utterly preposterous.
Say no more, Mr. Strange ; not another
word. My daughter cannot marry a professional
man. / did so, you may reply :
yes, and have forfeited my proper place in
the world ever since."

Mr. Brightman would have given Annabel
to me."

Possibly so, though I think not. As
Mr. Brightman is no longer here, we may let
that supposition alone. And you must allow
me to say this much, sir  that it is scarcely
seemly to come to me on any such subject
so soon after his death."

But " I stopped in embarrassment,

unable to give my reason for speaking so
soon. How could I tell Mrs. Brightman
that it was to afford Annabel a home and
a protector : that this, her mother's home,
was not fitting for a refined and sensitive
girl ?

But I pressed the suit. I told her I had
Annabel's consent, and that I had recently
been with her at Hastings. I should like
to have added that I had Miss Brightman's,
only that it might have done more harm
than good. I spoke very slightly of Miss
Brightman's projected departure from England,
when her house would be shut up and
Annabel must leave Hastings. And I added

VOL. III. 42

that I wanted to make a home for her by
that time.

I am sure she caught my implied meaning,
for she grew agitated and her hands
shook as they lay on her crape dress. Her
diamond rings, which she had not discarded,
flashed in the sunlight. But she rallied her
strength. All her pride rose up in rebellion.


'' My daughter has her own home, sir ;
her home with me  what do you mean ?
During my illness, I have allowed her to
remain with her aunt, but she will shortly
return to me."

And when I would have urged further,
and pleaded as for something dearer than
life, she peremptorily stopped me.

' I will hear no more, Mr. Strange. My
daughter is descended on my side from the
nobles of the land  you must forgive me for
thus alluding to it  and it is impossible that
I can forget that, or allow her to do so.
Never, with my consent, will she marry out
of that grade : a professional man is, in rank,

beneath her. This is my decision, and it is
unalterable. The subject is at an end, and
I beg of you never again to enter upon it."

There was no chance of my pursuing it
then, at any rate. Hatch came from the
house, a folded cloak on her arm, and approached
her mistress.

 The carriage is at the gate, ma'am."

Mrs. Brightman rose at once : she was
going for a drive. After what had just
passed, I held out my arm to her with some
hesitation. She put the tips of her fingers
within it, with a stiff '' Thank you," and we
walked to the gate in silence. I handed
her into the open carriage ; Hatch disposed
the cloak upon her knees, assisted by the
footman. With a cold bow, Mrs. Bright-man,
who had already as coldly shaken
hands with me, drove away.

Hatch, always ready for a gossip, stood
within the little iron gate while she spoke
to me.

We be going away for a bit, sir," she
began. " Did you know it ?"

' No. Mrs. Brightman has not mentioned
the matter to me."

Well, we be, then," continued Hatch ;
missis and me and Perry. Mr. Close
have got her to consent at last. I don't
say that she was well enough to go before ;
Close thought so, but I didn't. He wants
her gone, you see, Mr. Charles, to get that
fancy out of her head about master."

' But does she still think she sees him ?"

'' Not for the past few days," replied
Hatch. " She has changed her bedroom,
and taken to the best stare one ; and she
has been better in herself. Oh, she'll be all
right now for a bit, if only "

If only what ?" I asked, for Hatch had
paused.

' Well, you know, sir. If only she can
control herself. I'm certain she is trying
to," added Hatch. '' There ain't one of us
would be so glad to find it got rid of for
good and all as she'd be. She's put about
frightfully yet at Miss Annabel's knowing
of it."

'' And where is it that you are going to ?"

'' Missis talked of Cheltenham ; it was
early, she thought, for the seaside ; but
this morning she got a Cheltenham newspaper
up, and saw that amid the company
staying there were Captain and Lady Grace
Chantrey. ' I'm not going where my brother
and that wife of his are,' she says to me ina
temper  for, as I dare say you've heard,
Mr. Charles, they don't agree. And now
she talks of Brighton. Whatever place she
fixes on. Perry is to be sent on first to take
lodgings."

Well, Hatch," I said, " the change from
home will do your mistress good. She is
much better. I trust the improvement will
be permanent."

Ah, if she would but take care ! It all
lies in that, sir," concluded Hatch, as I
turned away from the gate, and she went up
the garden.

We must go back for a moment to the
previous evening. Leaving behind us the

church of St. Clement Danes and its lighted
windows, Lake and I turned into Essex
Street, arm-in-arm, went down it and reached
my door. I opened it with my latch-key.
The hall-lamp was not lighted, and I wondered
at Watts's neglect.

Go on up to my room," I said to Lake.
' I'll follow you in a moment."

He bounded up the stairs, and the next
moment Leah came up from the kitchen
with a lighted candle, her face white and
terrified.

'rit is only myself, Leah. Why is the
lamp not alight ?"

Heaven be good to us, sir !" she cried.
*' I thought I heard somebody go upstairs."

Mr. Lake has gone up."

She dropped her candlestick upon the
slab, and backed against the wall, looking
more white and terrified than ever. I
thought she was about to faint.

Mr. Charles ! I feel as if I could die 1
I ought to have bolted the front door."

But what for ?" I cried, intensely surprised.

" What on earth is the matter,
Leah ?"

He is up there, sir ! Up in your front
sitting-room. I put out the hall-lamp,
thinking the house would be best in darkness."


Who is up there ?" For in the moment's
bewilderment I did not glance at the
truth.

Mr. Tom, sir. Captain Heriot."

'' Mr. Tom ! Up there ?"

Not many minutes ago, soon after Watts
had gone out to church  for he was late
to-night  there came a ring at the doorbell,"
said Leah. '' I came up to answer it,
thinking nothing. A rough-looking man
stood, in a wide-awake hat, close against the
door there. ' Is Mr. Strange at home V
said he, and walked right in. I knew his
voice, and I knew him, and I cried out.
Don't be stupid, Leah ; it's only me,' says
he. ' Is Mr. Charles upstairs ? Nobody
with him, I hope.' ' There's nobody to
come and put his head in the lion's mouth,

as may be said, there at all, sir,' said I ; and
up he went, like a lamplighter. I put the
hall-lamp out. I was terrified out of my
senses, and told him you were at Hastings,
but I expected you in soon. And Mr.
Charles," wound up Leah, '' I think he must
have gone clean daft."

Light the lamp again," I replied. *' It
always is alight, you know. If the house is
in darkness, you might have a policeman
calling to know what was the matter."

Tom was in a fit of laughter when I got
upstairs. He had taken off his rough overcoat
and broad-brimmed hat, and stood in a
worn  very much worn  suit of brown velveteen
breeches and officers. Lake stared
at him over the table, a comical expression
on his face.

' Suppose we shake hands, to begin with,"
said Lake. And they clasped hands heartily
across the table.

Did you know me just now, in the
Strand, Lake ?" asked Tom Heriot.

'' I did," replied Lake, and his tone proved

that he meant it. ''I said to Charley, here,
that I had just seen a fellow very like Tom
Heriot ; but I knew who it was, fast enough."

' You wouldn't have known me, though,
if I hadn't lifted my face to the lamp-light.
I forget myself at moments, you see," added
Tom, after a pause. " Meeting you unexpectedly,
I was about to speak as in the old
days, and recollected myself only just intime.
I say "  turning himself about in
his velveteen   should you take me for a
gamekeeper ?"

No, I should not : you don't look the
thing at all," I put in testily, for I was
frightfully vexed with him altogether. " I
thought you must have been taken up by
your especial friend. Wren. Twice have I
been to the try sting-place as agreed, but you
did not appear."

No ; but I think he nearly had me,"
replied Tom.

How was that ?"

I'll tell you," he answered, as we all
three took chairs round the fire, and I stirred

it into a blaze. " On the Wednesday I did
not go out at all ; I told you I should not.
On the Thursday, after dusk, I went out to
meet you, Charley. It was early, and I
strolled in for a smoke with Lee and a chat
with Miss Betsy. The old man began at
once : ' Captain Strange, Policeman Wren
has been here, asking questions about you.'
It seems old Wren is well known in the
neighbourhood "

'' Captain Strange ?" cried Lake. "Who
is Captain Strange ?"

I am  down there," laughed Tom.
Don't interrupt, please. ' What questions
?' I said to Lee. ' Oh, what your
name was, and where you came from, and if
I had known you long, and what your ship
was called,' answered Lee. ' And you told
him ?' I asked. ' Well, I should have told
him, but for Betsy,' he said. ' Betsy spoke
up, saying you were a sailor-gentleman that
came in to buy tobacco and newspapers ; and
that was all he got out of us, not your name,
captain, or anything. As Betsy said to me

afterwards, it was not our place to answer
questions about Captain Strange : if the
policeman wanted to know anything, let
him apply to the captain himself Which I
thought good sense,' concluded Lee. As it
was."

Well, Tom ?"

Well, I thought it about time to go
straight home again," said Tom ; " and that's
why I did not meet you, Charley. And the
next day, Friday, I cleared out of my diggings
in that quarter of the globe, rigged
myself out afresh, and found other lodgings.
I am nearer to you now, Charley : vegetating
in the wilds over Blackfriars Bridge."

How could you be so imprudent as to
come here to-night ? or to be seen in so
conspicuous a spot as the Strand ?"

The fit took me to pay you a visit, old
fellow. As to the Strand  it is a fine
thoroughfare, you know, and I had not set
eyes on it since last summer. I walked up
and down a bit, listening to the church bells,
and looking about me."

You turn everything into ridicule, Tom."

Better that, Charley, than into sighing
and groaning."

How did you know that Leah would
open the door to you ? Watts might have
done so."

I had it all cut-and-dried. ' Is Mrs.
Brown at home V I should have said, in a
voice Watts would never have known.
 Mrs. Brown don't live here,' old Watts
would have answered ; upon which I should
have politely begged his pardon and walked
ofF."

All very fine, Tom, and you may think
yourself amazingly clever ; but as sure as
you are living, you will run these risks once
too often."

'' Not I. Didn't I give old Leah a scare !
You should have heard her shriek."

Suppose it had been some enemy  some
stickler for law and justice  that I had
brought home with me to-night, instead of
Lake ?"

But it wasn't," laughed Tom. " It was

Lake himself. And I guess he is as safe
as you are."

'' Be sure of that," added Lake. " But
what do you think of doing, Heriot ? You
cannot hide away for ever in the wilds of
Blaekfriars. / would not answer for your
safety there for a day."

Goodness knows!" said Tom. " Perhaps
Charley could put me up here  in one of
his top bedrooms ?"

Whether he spoke in jest or earnest, I
knew not. He might remember that I was
running a risk in concealing him even for an
hour or two. Were it discovered, the law
might make me answer for it.

' I should like something to eat, Charley."

Leaving him with Lake, I summoned
Leah, and bade her bring up quickly what
she had. She speedily appeared with the
tray.

' Good old Leah !" said Tom to her.
That ham looks tempting."

' Mr. Tom, if you go on like this, loitering
in the open streets and calling at houses,

trouble will overtake you," returned Leah, in
much the same tone she had used to reprimand
him when a child. " I wonder what
your dear, good mother would say to it if
she saw you throwing yourself into peril.
Do you remember, sir, how often she would
beg of you to be good ?"

My mother !" repeated Tom, who was
in one of his lightest moods. ' Why, you
never saw her. She was dead and buried
and gone to heaven before you knew anything
of us."

Ah well, Master Tom, you know I mean
Mrs. Heriot  afterwards Mrs. Strange. It
wouldn't be you, sir, if you didn't turn
everything into a jest. She was a good
mother to you all."

* That she was, Leah. Excused our
lessons for the asking, and fed us on jam."

He was taking his supper rapidly the
while ; for, of course, he had to be away
before church was over and Watts was
home again. The man might have been
true and faithful ; little doubt of it ; but it

would have added one more item to the
danger.

Lake went out and brought a cab ; and
Tom, his wide-awake low on his brow, his
rough coat on, and his red comforter roundabout
his throat, vaulted into it, to be conveyed
over Blackfriars Bridge to any point
that he might choose to indicate.

* It is an amazing hazard his going about
like this," cried Lake, as we sat down together
in front of the fire. " He must begot
out of England as quickly as possible."

But he won't go."

Then, mark my words, Charles, bad will
come of it."

RESTITUTION.

'' IME had gone on  weeks and
weeks  though there is little
to tell of passing events. Things
generally remained pretty much as they
had been. The Levels were abroad again.
Mrs. Brightman on the whole was better,
but had occasional relapses ; Annabel spent
most of her time at Hastings ; and Tom
Heriot had not yet been taken.

Tom was now at an obscure fishing village
on the coast of Scotland, passing himself off
as a fisherman, owning a small boat and
pretending to fish. This did not allay our
anxiety, which was almost as great as ever.

Still, it was something to have him away
from London. Out of Great Britain he
refused to move.

Does the reader remember George Coney's
money, that so strangely disappeared the
night of Mr. Brightman's death ? From that
hour to this nothing has been seen or heard
of it : but the time for it was now at hand.
And what I am about to relate may appear
a very common-place ending to a mystery 
though, indeed, it was not yet quite the
ending. In my capacity of story-teller I
could have invented a hundred romantic
incidents, and worked them and the reader
up to a high point of interest ; but I can
only record the incident as it happened,
and its termination was a very matter-of-fact
one.

I was sitting one evening in the front
room : a sitting-room now  I think this has
been said before  smoking my after-dinner
cigar. The window was open to the summer
air, which all day long had been intensely
hot. A letter received in the morning from
VOL. III. 43

Gloucestershire from Mr. Coney, to which
his son had scrawled a postscript : *' Has
that bag turned up yet ?" had set me thinking
of the loss, and from that I fell to thinking
of the loss of the Clavering will, which
had followed close upon it. Edmund Clavering,
by the way, had been with me that day to impart
some news. He was going to be married
to a charming girl, too  and we were discussing
settlements. My Lady Clavering,
he said, was figuring at Baden-baden, and
report ran that she was about to espouse a
French count with a fierce moustache.

Presently I took up the Times, not opened
before that day, and was deep in a police
case, which had convulsed the court in Marlborough
Street with laughter, and was convulsing
me, when a vehicle dashed down
Essex Street. It was the van of the Parcels
Delivery Company.

Mr. Strange live here ?" was the question
I heard from the man who had descended
from the seat beside the driver, when Watts
went out.

All right," said Watts.
' Here's a parcel for him. Nothing to
pay."

The driver whipped up his horse, then
turned sharply round, and  overturned the
van. It was not the first accident of a
similar nature, or the last by many, that I
have seen in that particular spot. How it
is I don't know, but drivers, especially cab-men,
have an unconquerable propensity for
pulling their horses round in a perilously
short fashion at the bottom of Essex Street,
and sometimes the result is that they come
to grief I threw down my newspaper and
leaned out at the window watching the fun.
The street was covered with parcels, and the
driver and his friend were throwing off their
consternation in choice language. One hamper
could not be picked up : it had contained
wine loosely packed, and the broken bottles
were lying in a red pool. Where the mob
collected from, that speedily arrived to assist,
was a marvel. The van at length took its
departure up the street, considerably shorn

43  2

of the triumph with which it had dashed
down.

This had taken up a considerable space of
time, and it was growing too dark to resume
my newspaper. Turning from the window,
I proceeded to examine the parcel which
Watts had brought up on its arrival and
placed on the table. It was about a foot
square, wrapped in brown paper, sealed and
tied with string ; and, in what Tony Bumpkin
would have called a confounded cramped,
up-and-down hand, where you could not tell
an izzard from an R, was directed '' C.
Strange, Esquire."

I took out my penknife, cut the string,
and removed the paper ; and there was disclosed
a pasteboard-box with green edges,
also sealed. I opened it, and from a mass
of soft paper took out a small canvas bag,
tied round with tape, and containing thirty
golden sovereigns !

From the very depth of my conviction I
believed it to be the bag we had lost. It
was the bag ; for, on turning it round, there

were Mr. Coney's initials, S. C, neatly
marked with blue cotton, as they had been
on the one left by George. It was one of
their sample barley bags. I wondered if they
were the same sovereigns. Where had it
been ? Who had taken it ? And who had
returned it ?

I rang the bell, and then called to Watts,
who was coming up to answer it, to bring
Leah also. It was my duty to tell them,
especially Leah, of the money's restitution,
as they had been inmates of the house when
it was lost.

Watts only stared and ejaculated ; but
Leah, with some colour, for once, in her pale
cheeks, clasped her hands. " Oh, sir, I'm
thankful you have found it again !" she exclaimed.
'' I'm heartily thankful !"

"So am I, Leah, though the mystery attending
the transaction is as great as ever ;
indeed, more so."

It certainly was. They went down again,
and I sat musing over the problem. But
nothing could I make out of it. One moment

I argued that the individual taking it (whomsoever
it might be) must have had temporary
need of funds, and, the difficulty over, had
now restored the money. The next, I
wondered whether anyone could have taken
the bag inadvertently, and had now discovered
it. I locked the bag safely up,
wrote a letter to George Coney, and then
went out to confide the news to Arthur
Lake.

Taking the short cuts and passages that
lead from Essex Street to the Temple, as I
generally did when bound for Lake's chambers,
I was passing onwards, when I found myself
called to  or I thought so. Standing still
in the shade, leaning against the railings of
the Temple Gardens, was a slight man of
middle height : and he seemed to say
Charley."

Glancing in doubt, half stopping as I did
so, yet thinking I must have been mistaken,
I was passing on, when the voice came
ao'ain.

o

'' Charley !"

I stopped then. And I declare that in
the revulsion it brought me you might have
knocked me down with a feather ; for it was
Tom Heriot.

I was almost sure it was you, Charles,"
he said in a low voice ; " but not quite sure."

I had not often had such a scare as this.
My heart, with pain and dismay, beat as if
it meant to burst its bonds.

* Can it possibly be you f I cried. " What
brings you here ? Why have you come
again f

' Reached London this morning. Came
here when dusk set in, thinking I might
have the luck to see you or Lake, Charley."

But why have you left Scotland ? You
were safer there."

Don't know that I was. And I had
grown tired to death of it."

It will end in death, or something like
it, if you persist in staying here."

Tom laughed his gay, ringing laugh. I
looked round to see that no one was about,
or within hearing.

What a croaker you are, old Charley !
I'm sure you ought to kill the fatted calf, to
celebrate my return from banishment."

But, Tom, you hioiv how dangerous it
is, and must be, for you to be here in London."

' And it was becoming dangerous uj)
there," he quickly rejoined. " Since the
summer season set in, those blessed tourists
are abroad again, with their staves and knapsacks.
No place is safe from them, and the
smaller and more obscure it is, the more
they are sure to find it. The other day I
was in my boat in my fishing toggery, as
usual, when a fellow comes up, addresses meas
' My good man,' and plunges into queries
touching the sea and the fishing-trade. Now
>/ho do you think that was, Charles ?"

I can't say."

It was James Lawless, Q.C  the
leader who prosecuted at my trial."

Good heavens !"

I unfastened the boat, keeping my back
to him and my face down, and shot off like
a whirlwind, calling out that I was behind

time, and must put out. I took good care,
Charles, not to get back before the stars were
bright in the night sky."

Did he recognise you ?"

No  no. For certain, no. But he
would have done so had I stayed to talk.
And it is not always that I could escape as
I did then. You must see that."

I saw it all too plainly.

''So I thought it best to make myself
scarce, Charles, and leave the tourists' haunts.
I sold my boat ; no difficulty in that ; though,
of course, the two men who bought it shaved
me ; and came over to London as fast as a
third-class train would bring me. Dare not
put my nose into a first-class carriage, lest
I should drop upon some one of my old
chums."

Of all places, Tom, you should not have
chosen London."

'' Will you tell me, old fellow, what other
place I could have pitched upon ?"

And I could not tell.

'' Go where I will " he continued, ' it

seems that the Philistines are likely to find
me out."

We were pacing about now, side by side,
keeping in the shade as much as possible,
and speaking under our breath.

'' You will have to leave the country,
Tom ; you must do it. And go somewhere
over the seas."

To Van Diem en's Land, perhaps," suggested
Tom.

Now, be quiet. The subject is too
serious for jesting. T should think  perhaps
 America. But I must have time to
consider. Where do you mean to stay at
present ? Where are you going to-night ?"

I've been dodging about all day, not
showing ujD much ; but I'm going now to
where I lodged last, down Blackfriars way.
You remember ?"

Yes, I remember : it is not so long-ago."


"It is as safe as any other quarter, for
aught I can tell. Any way, I don't know
of another."

'' Are you well, Tom ?" I asked. He
was looking thin, and seemed to have a
nasty cough upon him.

'' I caught cold some time ago, and it
hangs about me," he replied. '' Oh, I shall be
all right now I'm here," he added carelessly.

You ought to take a good jorum of
something hot when you get to bed tonight
"

Tom laughed. '' I am likely to get anything
of that sort in any lodging I stand a
chance of to-night. Well done, Charley !
I haven't old Leah to coddle me."

And somehow the mocking words made
me realize the discomforts and deprivations
of Tom Heriot's present life. How would
it all end ?

We parted with a hand shake : he stealing
off on his way to his lodging, I going
thoughtfully on mine. It was a calm summer
evening, clear and lovely, the stars
twinkling in the sky, but all its peace had
gone out for me.

It was impossible to foresee what the

ending would or could be. At any moment
Tom might be recognised and captured, so
long as he inhabited London ; and it might
be difficult to induce him to leave it. Still
more difficult to cause him to depart altogether
for other lands and climes.

Not long before, I had consulted with
Mr. Serjeant Stillingfar as to the possibility
of obtaining a pardon for Tom. That he
had not been guilty was indisputable, though
the law had deemed him so. But the Serjeant
had given me no encouragement that
any such movement would be successful.
The very fact, as he pointed out, of Tom
Heriot's having escaped clandestinely, would
tell against him. What, I said then, if Tom
gave himself up ? He smiled, and told me
I had better not ask his opinion upon the
practical points of the case.

So the old trouble was back again in full
force, and I knew not how to cope with it.

The summer sun, glowing with light and
heat, lay full upon Hastings and St.



Leonard's. The broad expanse of sea
sparkled beneath it ; the houses that looked
on the water were burnings and blistering
the fierce rays. Miss Briofhtman,
seated at her drawings-room window, knitting*
in hand, observed that it was one of the most
dazzling days she remembered.

The remark was made to me and to Annabel.
We sat at the table together, looking
over a book of costly engravings that
Miss Brightman had recently bought. " I
shall leave it with you, Charles," she said,
' when I go away ; you will take care of it.
And if it were not that you are tied to
London, and it would be too far for you to
go up and down daily, I would leave you my
house also  that you might live in it, and
take care of that during my absence."

Mrs. Brightman had come to her senses.
Very much, I confess, to my astonishment,
much also I think to Annabel's, she had put
aside her prejudices and consented to our
marriage. The difficulty of where her
daughter was to be during Miss Brightman's

sojourn in Madeira had in a degree paved
the way for it. Annabel would, of course,
have returned to her mother ; she begged
hard to be allowed to do so : she believed it
her duty to be with her. But Miss Bright-man
would not hear of it, and, had she
yielded, I should have interposed my veto in
Mr. Brightman's name. In Hatch's words,
strong in sense but weak in grammar, " their
home wasn't no home for Miss Annabel."

Mrs. Brightman could only be conscious
of this. During her sojourn at Brighton,
and for some little time after her return
home, she had been very much better ; had
fought resolutely with the insidious foe, and
conquered. But alas ! she fell away again.
Now she was almost as bad as ever ; tolerably
sober by day, very much the opposite
by night.

Miss Brightman, dating forward, seeing,
as she feared, only shoals and pitfalls, and
most anxious for Annabel, had journeyed upto
Clapham to her sister-in-law, and stayed
there with her a couple of days. What

passed between them even Hatch never
knew ; but she did know that her mistress
was brought to a penitent and subdued frame
of mind, and that she promised Lucy Bright-man,
with many tears, to strive to overcome
her fatal habit for the good God's sake.
x\.nd it was during this visit that she withdrew
her opposition to the marriage ; when
Miss Brightman returned home she carried
the consent with her.

And my present visit to Hastings was to
discuss time and place and other matters ;
more particularly the question of where our
home was to be. A large London house we
were not yet rich enough to set up, and I
would not take Annabel to an inferior one ;
but I had seen a charming little cottage at
Richmond that might suit us  if she liked
the locality.

Closing the book of engravings, I turned
to Miss Brightman, and entered upon the
subject. Suddenly her attention wavered.
It seemed to be attracted by something in
the road.

Why, bless my heart, it is /" she cried
in astonishment. ' If ever I saw Hatch in
my life, that is Hatch  coming up the
street ! Annabel, child, give me the glasses."

The glasses were on the table, and I
handed them to her. Annabel flew to the
window and grew white. She was never
free from fears of what might happen in her
mother's house. Hatch it was, and apparently
in haste.

What can be the matter ?" she gasped.
' Oh, Aunt Lucy !"

 Hatch is nodding heartily, as if not
much were wrong," remarked Miss Bright-man,
who was watching her through the
glasses. '' Hatch is peculiar in manner, as
you are aware, Mr. Charles, but she means
no disrespect by it."

I smiled. I knew Hatch quite as well
as Miss Brightman knew her.

' Now what brings you to Hastings ?"
she exclaimed, rising from her chair, when
Hatch was shown in.

My missis brought me, ma'am," returned

Hatch, with composure. ' Miss Annabel,
you be looking frighted, but there's nothing
wrong. Yesterday morning, all in a flurry
like, your mamma took it into her head
to come down here, and we drove down
with "

 Drove down ?"

Yes, ma'am, with four posters to the
carriage. My missis can't bear the rail ; she
says folks stare at her : and here we be at the
Queen s Hotel, she, and me, and Perry."

Would you like to take a chair, Hatch ?"
said Miss Brioiitman.

My legs is used to standing, ma'am,"
replied Hatch, with a nod of thanks, " and
I've not much time to linger. It was late
last night when we got here. This morning,
up gets my missis, and downstairs she comes
to her breakfast in her sitting-room, and me
with her to wait upon her, for sometimes
her hands is shaky, and she prefers me to
Perry or anybody else "

How has your mistress been lately ?"
interposed Miss Brightman.

VOL. III. 44

' Better, ma'am. Not always quite the
things, though a deal better on the whole.
But I must get on about this morning,"
added Hatch impressively. "  Waiter,' says
my missis when the man brings up the
coffee.  Mum ?' says he. ' I am subject
to statical attacks in the chest,' says she,
and should like to have some brandy in
my room : they take me sometimes in the
middle of the night. Put a bottle into it,
the very best French, and a corkscrew. Or
you may as well put two bottles,' she goes
on ; ' I may be here some time.' ' It shall
be done, mum,' says he. I was as vexed as
I could be to hear it," broke off Hatch, " but
what could I do ? I couldn't contradict my
missis and tell the man that no brandy must
be put in her room, or else she'd drink it.
Well, ma'am, I goes down presently to my
own breakfast with Perry, and while we sat
at it a chambermaid comes through the
room : ' I've put two bottles of brandy in
the lady's bedroom, as was ordered,' says she.
With that Perry looks at me all in a fluster

he have no more wits to turn things off
than a born idiot.  Very well says I to
her, eating at my egg as if I thought
nothing ; ' I hopes my missis won't have no
call to use 'em, but she's took awful bad in
the chest sometimes, and it's as well for us
to be ready.' ' I'm sure I pities her,' says
the girl,  for there ain't nothing worse than
spasms. I has 'em myself occasional ' "

When once Hatch was in the full flow of
a narrative, there was no getting in a word
edgeways, and Miss Brightman had to repeat
her question twice :  Does Perry know
the nature of the illness that affects Mrs.
Brightman ?"

Why, in course he does, ma'am," was
Hatch's rejoinder. " He couldn't be off
guessing it for himself, and the rest I told
him. Why, ma'am, without his helping, we
could never keep it dark from the servants
at home. It was better to make a confidant
of Perry, that I might have his aid in
screening the trouble, than to let it get
round to everybody. He's as safe and sure

442

as I be, and when it all first came out to
him, he cried over it, to think of what his
poor master must have suffered in mind
before death took him. Well, ma'am, I
made haste over my breakfast, and I went
upstairs, and there was the bottles and the
corkscrew, so I whips 'em off the table and
puts them out of sight. Mrs. Brightman
comes uj) presently, and looks about and
goes down again. Three separate times she
comes up, and the third time she gives the
bell a whirl, and in runs the chambermaid,
who Alas only outside. ' I gave orders this
morning,' says my lady, ' to have some
brandy placed in the room.' ' Oh, I have
got the brandy,' says I, before the girl could
speak ;  I put it in the little cupboard here,
ma'am.' So away goes the girl, looking
from the corners of her eyes at me, as if
suspicious I meant to crib it for my own
use : and my mistress began : ' Draw one of
them corks. Hatch.' ' No, ma'am,' says I,
not yet ; please don't.'  Draw 'em both,'
says missis  for there are times," added

Hatch, " when a trifle puts her out so much
that it's hazardous to cross her. I drew the
cork of one, and missis just pointed with her
finger to the tumbler on the wash-hand-stand,
and I brought it forward and the
decanter of water. ' Now you may go,'
says she ; so I took up the corkscrew. ' I
told you to leave that,' says she, in her
temper, and I had to come away without it,
and the minute I was gone she turned the
key upon me. Miss Annabel, I see the
words are grieving of you, but they are the
truth, and I can but tell them."

Is she there now  locked in ?" asked
Miss Brightman.

She's there now," returned Hatch, with
solemn enunciation, to make up for her failings
in grammar, which was never anywhere
in times of excitement ; " she is locked in with
them two bottles and the corkscrew, and
she'll just drink herself mad  and what's to
be done ? I goes at once to Perry and tells
him. ' Let's get in through the winder,'
says Perry  which his brains is only fit fora

oj'ander, as I've said many a time.  You
stop outside her door to listen again downright
harm says I, ' that's what you'll do ;
and I'll go for Miss Brightman.' And here
I'm come, ma'am, running all the way."

What can I do ?" wailed Miss Bright-man.


Ma'am," answered Hatch, " I think that
if you'll go back with me, and knock at her
room door, and call out that you be come to
pay her a visit, she'd undo it. She's more
afeared of you than of anybody living. She
can't have done herself much harm yet, and
you might coax her out for a walk or a drive,
and then bring her in to dinner here 
anything to get her away from them two
dangerous bottles. If I be making too free,
ma'am, you'll be good enough to excuse me
it is for the family's sake. At home I
can manage her pretty well, but to have a
scene at the hotel would make it public."

What is to be the ending ?" I exclaimed
involuntarily as Miss Brightman went in
haste for her bonnet.

Why, the ending must be  just what it
will be," observed Hatch philosophically.
'' But, Mr. Charles, I don't despair of her
yet. Begging your pardon, Miss Annabel,
you'd better not come. Your mamma won't
undo her door if she thinks there's many
round it."

Annabel stood at the window as they
departed, her face turned from me, her eyes
blinded with tears. I drew her away, though
I hardly knew how to soothe her. It was a
heavy grief to bear.

My days are passed in dread of what
tidings may be on the way to me," she
began, after a little time given to gathering
composure. '' I ought to be nearer my
mother, Charles ; I tell Aunt Lucy so
almost every day. She might be ill and
dead before I could get to her, up in
London."

And you will be nearer to her shortly,
Annabel. My dear, where shall our home
be ? I was thinking of Richmond "

No, no," she interrupted in sufficient

haste to show me she had thoughts of her
own.

Annabel ! It shall not be there : at
your mother's. An3r\vhere else."

"It is somewhere else that I want to
be."

Then you shall be. Where is it ?"

She lifted her face like a pleading child's,
and spoke in a whisper. " Charles, let me
come to you in Essex Street."

Essex Street /" I echoed in surprise.
'' My dear Annabel, I will certainly not bring
you to Essex Street and its inconveniences.
I cannot do great things for you yet, but I
can do better than that."

They would not be inconveniences to me.
I would turn them into pleasures. We would
take another servant to help Watts and Leah ;
or two if necessary. You would not find me
the least encumbrance ; I would never be in
the way of your professional rooms. And
in the evening, when you had finished for
the day, we would dine, and go down to
mamma's for an hour, and then back again.

Charles, it would be a liap2)y home : let me
come to it."

But I shook my head. I did not see how
it could be arranged ; and said so.

No, because at present the idea is new
to you," returned Annabel. " Think it over,
Charles. Promise me that you will do so."

Yes, my dear ; I can at least promise
you that."

There was less trouble with Mrs. Bright-man
that day than had been anticipated.
She opened her door at once to her sister-in-law,
who brought her back to the Terrace.
Hatch had been wise. In the afternoon we
all went for a drive in a fly, and returned to
dinner. And the following day Mrs. Bright-man,
with her servants, departed for London
in her travelling-carriage, no scandal whatever
having been caused at the Queen's
Hotel. I went up by train early in the
morning.

It is surprising how much thinking upon
a problem simplifies it. I began to see by
degrees that Annabel's coming to Essex

Street could be easily managed ; nay, that
it would be for the best. Miss Brightman
strongly advocated it. At present a large
portion of my income had to be paid over
to Mrs. Brightman in accordance with . her
husband's will, so that I could not do as
I would, and must study economy. Annabel
would be rich in time ; for Mrs. Bright-man's
large income, vested at present in
trustees, must eventually descend to Annabel
; but that time was not yet. And who
knew what expenses Tom Heriot might
bring upon me ?

Changes had to be made in the house. I
determined to confine the business rooms to
the ground floor ; making Miss Method's
parlour, which had not been much used since
her death, my own private consulting-room.
The front room on the first floor would be
our drawing-room, the one behind it the
dining-room.

Leah was in an ecstasy when she heard
the news. The workmen were coming in to
paint and paper, and then I told her.

Of course, Mr. Charles, it  is "

Is what, Leah ?"

Miss Annabel."

* It should be no one else, Leah. We
shall want another servant or two, but you
can still be major-domo."

' If my poor master had only lived to see
it !" she uttered, with enthusiasm. ' How
happy he would have been ; how proud to
have her here ! Well, well, what turns things
take !"

CONFESSION.

 October came in ; and we were
married early in the month, the
wedding taking place from Mrs.
Brightman's residence, as was of course only
right and proper. It was so very quiet a
wedding that there is not the least necessity
for describing it  and how can a young man
be expected to give the particulars of his
own ? Mr. Serjeant Stillingfar was present ;
Lord and Lady Level, now staying in London,
drove down for it ; and Captain Chantrey gave
his niece away. For Mrs. Brightman had
chosen to request him to accept her invitation
to do so, and to be accompanied by his

wife, Lady Grace. Miss Brightman was also
present, having travelled up from Hastings
the day before. Three or four days later on,
she would sail for Madeira.

I could not spare more than a fortnight
from work, leaving Lennard as my locum
tenens. Annabel would have been glad to
spare less, for she was haunted by visions of
what might happen to her mother. Though
there was no especial cause for anxiety in
that quarter just now, she could never feel
at ease. And on my part I was more
anxious than ever about Tom Heriot, for
more reasons than one.

The fortnight came to an end, all too
soon : and late on the Saturday evening we
reached home. Watts threw open the door,
and there stood Leah in a silk gown. The
drawing-room, gayer than it used to be, was
bright with a fire and preparations for tea.

'' How homelike it looks !" exclaimed
Annabel. " Charles," she whispered, turning
to me with her earnest eyes, as she had
been wont to do when a child : " I will not

make the least noise when you have cents
with you. You shall not know I am in the
house : I will take care not to drop even a
reel of cotton on the carpet. I do thank
you for letting me come to Essex Street : I
should not have seemed so completely your
wife had you taken me to any but your old
home."

The floors above were also in order,
their chambers refurnished. Leah went upto
them with her new mistress, and I went
down to the clerks' office, telling Annabel I
should not be there five minutes. One of
the clerks, Allen, had waited ; but I had expected
Lennard.

Is Mr. Lennard not here ?" I asked.
' Did he not wait ? I wrote to him to do
so."

Mr. Lennard has not been here all day,
sir," was Allen's reply. '' A messenger
came from him this morning, to say he was
ill."

We were deep in letters and other matters,
I and Allen, when the front door

opened next the office door, and there stood
Arthur Lake, laughing, a light coat on his
arm.

Fancy ! I've been down the river for a
blow," cried he. " Just landed at the pier
here. Seeing lights in your windows, I
thought you must have got back, Charley."

We shook hands, and he stayed a minute,
talking. Then, wishing good-night to Allen,
he backed out of the room, making an almost
imperceptible movement to me with his head.
I followed him out, shutting the office door
behind me. Lake touched my arm and drew
me outside.

' I suppose you've not heard from Tom
Heriot since you were away," breathed Lake,
in cautious tones, as we stood together on
the outer step.

No ; I did not expect to hear. Why ?"

' I saw him three days ago," whispered
Lake. " I had a queer-looking letter on
Wednesday morning from one Mr. Dominic
Turk, asking me to call at a certain place in
Southwark. Of course, I guessed it was

Tom, and that he had moved his lodgings
again ; and I found I was right."

Dominic Turk I" I repeated. ' Does
he call himself that f "

Lake laughed. '' He is passing now fora
retired schoolmaster. Says he's sure nobody
can doubt he is one as long as he sticks
to that name."

How is he ? Has any fresh trouble
turned up ? I'm sure you've something bad
to tell me."

Well, Charley, honestly speaking, it is
a bad look-out, in more ways than one," he
answered. '' He is very ill, to begin with ;
also has an idea that a certain policeman
named Wren has picked up an inkling of his
return, and is trying to unearth him. But,"
added Lake, " we can't very well talk in this
place. I've more to say "

Come upstairs, and take tea with me
and Annabel," I interrupted.

Can't," said he ; " my dinner's waiting.
I'm back two hours later than I expected to
be ; it has been frizzling, I expect, all the

time. Besides, old fellow, I'd rather you
and I were alone. There's fearful peril
looming ahead, unless I'm mistaken. Can
you come round to my chambers tomorrow
afternoon ?"

'' No : we are going to Mrs. Brightman's
after morning service."

'' It must be left until Monday, then ;
but I don't think there's much time to be
lost. Good-night."

Lake hastened up the street, and I returned
to Allen and the letters.

With this interruption, and with all I
found to do, the eve minutes' absence I had
promised my wife lengthened into twenty.
At last the office was closed for the nio-ht,
Allen left, and I ran upstairs, expecting to
have kept Annabel waiting tea. She was
not in the drawing-room, the tea was not
made, and I went up higher and found her
sobbing in the bedroom. It sent me into a
cold chill.

My love, what is this ? Are you disappointed
? Are you not happy ?"

VOL. III. 45

'' Oh, Charles," she sobbed, singing tome,
'' you 'knoiv I am happy. It is not that.
But I could not help thinking of my father.
Leah got talking about him ; and I remembered
once his sitting in that very chair, holding
me on his knee. I must have been about
seven years old. Miss Methold was ill "

At that moment there came a knock and
a ring at the front door. Not a common
knock and ring, but sharp, loud and prolonged,
resounding through the house as
from some impatient messenger of evil. It
startled us both. Annabel's fears flew to
her mother ; mine to a different quarter, for
Lake's communication was troubling and
tormenting me.

'' Charles ! if "

Hush, dear. Listen."

As we stood outside on the landing, her
heart beating against my encircling hand,
and our senses strained to listen, we heard
Watts open the front door.

Has Mr. Strange come home ?" cried a
voice hurriedly  that of a woman.

'' Yes," said Watts.

'' Can I speak to him ? It is on a matter
of life and death."

Where do you come from ?" asked Watts,
with habitual caution.

'' I come from Mr. Lennard. Oh, pray
do not waste time !"

' All right, my darling ; it is not from
your mother," I whispered to Annabel, as I
ran down.

A young woman stood at the foot of the
stairs ; I was at a loss to guess her condition
in life. She had the face and manner
of a lady, but her dress was poor and shabby.

I have come from my father, sir  Mr.
Lennard," she said in a low tone, blushing
very much. " He is dangerously ill : we
fear he is dying, and so does he. He bade
me say that he must see you, or he cannot
die in peace. Will you please be at the
trouble of coming ?"

One hasty word despatched to my wife,
and I went out with Miss Lennard, hailing
a cab, which had just set down its freight

45  2

some doors higher up. " What is the matter
with your father ?" I questioned, as we
whirled along towards Blackfriars Bridge, in
accordance with her directions.

'' It is an attack of inward inflammation,"
she replied. ' He was taken ill suddenly
last night after he got home from the office,
and he has been in great agony all day.
This evening he grew better ; the pain almost
subsided ; but the doctor said that might
not prove a favourable symptom. My father
asked for the truth  whether he was dying,
and the answer was that he might be. Then
my father grew terribly uneasy in mind, and
said he must see you if possible before he
died  and sent me to ascertain, sir, whether
you had returned home."

The cab drew up at a house in a side
street, a little beyond Blackfriars Bridge.
We entered, and Miss Lennard left me in
the front sitting-room. The remnants of
faded gentility were strangely mixed with
bareness and poverty. Poor Lennard was a
gentleman born and bred, but had been reduced

by untoward misfortune. Trifling
ornaments stood about ; " antimacassars "
were thrown over the shabby chairs. Miss
Lennard had gone upstairs, but came down
quickly.

"It is the door on the left, sir, on the
second landing," said she, putting a candle
in my hand. '' My father is anxiously expecting
you, but says I am not to go u})."

It was a small landings, nothing in front
of me but a bare white-washed wall, and ttvo
doors to the left. I blundered into the wrong-one.
A night-cap border turned on the bed,
and a girlish face looked up from under it.

What do you want ?" she said.

Pardon me. I am in search of Mr.
Lennard."

Oh, it is the next room. But  sir !
wait a moment. Oh, wait, wait !"

I turned to her in surprise, and she put
up two thin white hands in an imploring
attitude. " Is it anything bad ? Have you
come to take him ?"

To take him ! What do you mean ?"

You are not a sheriff's officer ?"

I smiled at her troubled countenance. " I
am Mr. Strange  come to see how he is."

Down fell her hands peacefully. ' Sir, I
beg your pardon : thank you for telling me.
I know papa has sometimes been in apprehension,
and I lie here and fear things till I
am stupid. A strange step on the stairs, ora
strange knock at the door, sets me
shaking."

The next room was the right one, and
Lennard was lying in it on a low bed ; his
face looked ghastly, his eyes wildly anxious.

Lennard," I said, " I am sorry to hear of
your illness. What's the matter ?"

Sit down, Mr. Strange ; sit down," he
added, pointing to a chair, which I drew
near. "It is an attack of inflammation :
the pain has ceased now, but the doctor says
it is an uncertain symptom : it may be for
better, or it may be for worse. If the
latter, I have not many hours to live."

What brought it on ?"

'' I don't know : unless it was that I

drank a draught of cold water when I was
hot. I have not been very strong for sometime,
and a little thing sends me into a
violent heat. I had a long walk, four miles,
and I made nearly a run of it half the way,
being pressed for time. When I got in, I
asked Leah for some water, and drank two
glasses of it, one after the other. It seemed
to strike a chill to me at the time."

It was at the office, then. Four miles !
Why did you not ride ?"

It was not your business I was out on,
sir ; it was my own. But whether that was
the cause or not, the illness came on, and it
cannot be remedied now. If I am to die, I
must die ; God is over all : but I cannot go
without making a confession to you. How
the fear of death's approach alters a man's
views and feelings !" he went on, in a different
tone. " Yesterday, had I been told I must
make this confession to you, I should have
said, Let me die, rather ; but it appears tome
now to be an imperative duty, and one
I must nerve myself to perform."

Lennard lay on his pillow, and looked
fixedly at me, and I not less fixedly at him.
What, in the shape of a '' confession," could
he have to make to me ? He had been
managing clerk in Mr. Brightman's office
long before I was in it, a man of severe integrity,
and respected by all.

"The night Mr. Brightman died," he
began under his panting breath, 'the bag
of gold was missing  George Coney's. You
remember it."

' Well ?"

I took it."

Was Lennard's mind wandering" ? He
was no more likely to take gold than I was.
I sat still, gazing at him.

'' Yes, it was I who took it, sir. Will
you hear the tale ?"

A deep breath, and the drawing of my
chair closer to his bedside, was my only
answer.

" You are a young man, Mr. Strange. I
have taken an interest in you since you first
came, a lad, into the office, and were under

my authority  Charles, do this ; Charles,
do the other. Not that I have shown any
especial interest, for outwardly I am cold
and undemonstrative ; but I saw what you
were, and liked you in my heart. You area
young man yet, I say ; but, liking you,
hoping for your welfare, I pray Heaven that
it may never be your fate, in after-life, to
be trammelled with misfortunes as I have
been. For me they seem to have had no
end, and the worst of them in later years
has been that brought upon me by an undutiful
and spendthrift son."

In a moment there flashed into my mind
my later trouble in Tom Heriot : I seemed
to be comparing the one with the other.
Have you been trammelled with an undutiful
son ?" I said aloud.

' I have been, and am," replied Lennard.
It has been my later cross. The first was
that of losing my property and position in
life, for, as you know, Mr. Strange, I was
born and reared a gentleman. The last
cross has been Leonard  that is his name,

Lennard Lennard  and it has been worse
than the first, for it has kept us down, and
in a perpetual ferment for years. It has
kept us poor amongst the poor : my salary,
as you know, is a handsome one, but it has
chiefly to be wasted upon him."

' What age is he ?"

*' Six-and-twenty yesterday."

'' Then you are not forced to supply his
extravagance, to find money for his faults
and follies. You are not obliged to let him
keep you down."

By law, no," sighed poor Lennard.
' But these ill-doing* sons sometimes entwine
themselves around your very heartstrings
; far rather would you suffer and
suffer than not ward off the ill from them.
He has tried his hand at many occupations,
but remains at none ; the result is always
trouble : and yet his education and intellect,
his good looks and perfect, pleasant manners,
would fit him for almost any responsible
position in life. But he is reckless. Get
into what scrape he would, whether of debtor

worse, here he was sure of a refuge and a
welcome ; I received him, his mother and
sisters loved him. One of them is bedridden,"
he added, in an altered tone.

I went first by mistake into the next
room. I probably saw her."

'eyes, that's Maria. It is a weakness
that has settled in her legs ; some chronic
affection, I suppose ; and there she has lain
for ten months. With medical attendance
and sea air she might be restored, they tell
me, but I can provide neither. Leonard's
claims have been too heavy."

'but should you waste means on him
that ought to be applied to her necessities ?"
I involuntarily interrupted.

He half raised himself on his elbow, and
the effort proved how weak he was, and his
eyes and his voice betrayed a strange earnestness.
" When a son, whom you love better
than life itself, has to be saved from the
consequences of his follies, from prison, from
worse disgrace even than that, other interests
are forgotten, let them be what they may.

Silent, patient needs give way to obtrusive
wants that stare you in the face, and that
may bear fear and danger in their train.
Mr. Strange, you can imagine this."

I do. It must ever be so."

' The pecuniary wants of a young man,
such as my son is, are as the cry of the
horse-leech. Give ! give ! Leonard mixes
sometimes with distant relatives, young
fellows of fashion, who are moving in a
sphere far above our present position,
although I constantly warn him not to doit.
One of these wants, imperative and to
be provided for in some way or other,
occurred the beginning of February in this
year. How I managed to pay it I can
hardly tell, but it stripped me of all the
money I could raise, and left me with some
urgent debts upon me. The rent was owing,
twelve months the previous December, and
some of the tradespeople were becoming
clamorous. The landlord, discerning the
state of affairs, put in a distress, terrifying
poor Maria, whose illness had then not very

long set in, almost to death. That I had
the means to pay the man out you may judge,
when I tell you that we had not the money
to buy a joint of meat or a loaf of bread."

Lennard paused to wipe the dew from his
brow.

* Maria was in bed, wanting comforts ;
Charlotte was worn out with apprehension ;
Leonard was away again, and we had
nothing. Of my wife I will not speak :
of delicate frame and delicately reared, the
long-continued troubles have reduced her to
a sort of dumb apathy. No credit anywhere,
and a distress in for rent ! In sheer
despair, I resolved to disclose part of my
difficulty to Mr. Brightman, and ask him to
advance me a portion of my next quarter s
salary. I hated to do it. A reduced gentleman
is, perhaps, over-fastidious. I know I
have been so, and my pride rose against it.
In health, I could not have spoken to you,
Mr. Charles, as I am now doing. I went
on, shilly-shallying for a few days. On the
Saturday morning Charlotte came to me

with a whisper : ' That man in the house
says if the rent is not paid to-night, the
things will be taken out and sold on Monday
: it is the very last day they'll give.' I
went to the office, my mind made up at
length, and thinking what I should say to
Mr. Brightman. Should I tell him part of
the truth, or should I urge some plea, foreign
to it ? It was an unusually busy day : I
dare say you remember it, Mr. Charles, for
it was that of Mr. Brightman's sudden death.
Client after client called, and no opportunity
offered for my speaking to him in private.
I waited for him to come down, on his way
out in the evening, thinking I would speak
to him then. He did not come, and when
the clients left, and I went upstairs, I found
he wffe stopping in town to see Sir Edmund
Clavering. I should have spoken to him
then, but you were present. He told me
to look in ao-ain in the course of the evenings,
and I hoped I might find him alone then.
You recollect the subsequent events of the
night, sir ?"

I shall never forget them."

'' When I came in, as he directed me, between
seven and eight o'clock, there occurred
that flurry with Leah  the cause of which
I never knew. She said Mr. Brightman
was alone, and I went up. He was lying in
your room, Mr. Charles ; had fallen close to
his own desk, the deep drawer of which stood
open. I tried to raise him ; I sprinkled
water on his face, but I saw that he was
dead. On the desk lay a small canvas bag.
I took it up and shook it. Why, I do not
know, for I declare that no wrong thought
had then come into my mind. He appeared
to have momentarily put it out of the
drawer, probably in search of something, for
his private cheque-book and the key of the
iron safe, that I knew were always kept in
the drawer, lay near it. I shook the bag,
and its contents sounded like gold. I opened
it, and counted thirty sovereigns. Mr.
Brightman was dead. I could not apply
to him ; and yet money I must have.
The temptation upon me was strong, and I

took it. Don't turn away from me, sir.
There are some temptations too strong to be
resisted by a man in his necessities."

Indeed, I am not turning from you.
The temptation was overwhehiiingly great."

Indeed," continued the sick man, " the
devil was near me then. I put the key
and the cheque-book inside, and I locked the
drawer, and placed the keys in Mr. Bright-man's
pocket, where he kept them, and I
leaped down the stairs with the bag in my
hand. It was all done in a minute or two
of time, though it seems long in relating it.
Where should I put the bag, now I had
it ? Upon my person ? No : it might be
missed directly, and inquired for. I was ina
tumult  scarcely sane, I believe  and I
dashed into the clerks' office, and, taking off
the lid of the coal-box, put it there. Then
I tore off for a surgeon. You know the
rest. When I returned with him you were
there ; and the next visitor, while we were
standing round Mr. Brightman, was George
Coney, after his bag of money. I never

shall forget the feeling when you motioned
me to take Mr. Brightman's keys from his
pocket to get the bag out of the drawer.
Or when  after it was missed  you took
me with you to search for it, in the very
office where it was, and I moved the coal-box
under the desk. Had you only happened
to lift the lid, sir !"

Ah !"

'' When the search was over, and I went
home, I had put the bag in my breast-pocket.
The gold saved me from immediate
trouble, but "

You have sent it back to me, you know
the bag and the thirty pounds."

Yes, I sent it back  tardily. I cotdd
not do it earlier, though the crime coloured
my days with remorse, and I never knew a
happy moment until it was restored. But
Leonard had been back again, and restoration
was not easy."

Miss Lennard opened the door at this
juncture. " Papa, the doctor is here. Can
he come up ? He says he ought to see you.

VOL. III. 46

'' Oh, certainly, he must come up," I interposed.


Yes, yes, Charlotte," said Lennard.

The doctor came in, and stood looking at
his patient, after putting a few questions.
Well," said he, " you are better ; you will
get over it."

Do you really think so ?" I asked joyfully.


Decidedly I do, now. It has been a
sharp twinge, but the danger's over. You
see, when pain suddenly ceases, mortification
sometimes sets in, and I could not be sure.
But you will do this time, Mr. Lennard."

Lennard had little more to say ; and,
soon after the doctor left, I prepared to
follow him.

There's a trifle of salary due to me, Mr.
Strange," he whispered ; " that which has
been going on since Quarter Day. I suppose
you will not keep it from me ?"

Keep it from you ! No. Why should
I ? Do you want it at once ? You can
have it if you do."

Leonard looked up wistfully. " You do
not think of taking me back again ? You
will not do that ?"

Yes, I will. You and I shall understand
each other better than ever now."

The tears welled up to his eyes. He laid
his other hand  I had taken one  across
his face. I bent over him with a whisper.

What has passed to-night need never
be recurred to between us ; and I shall never
speak of it to another. We all have our
trials and troubles, Lennard. A very weighty
one is lying now upon me, though it is not
absolutely my own  brought upon me, you
see, as yours was. And it is worse than
yours."

Worse 1" he exclaimed, looking at me.

More dangerous in its possible consequences.
Now mind," I broke off, shaking
him by the hand, " you are not to attempt
to come to Essex Street until you are quite
strong enough for it. But I shall see you
here again on Monday, for I have two or
three questions to ask you as to some of the

4G 2

matters that have transpired during my
absence. Good-night, Lennard ; keep up a
good heart ; you will outlive your trials yet."
And when I left him he was fairly sobbing.


DANGER.

RS. Brighten was certainly
improving. When I reached her
house with Annabel on the following
day, Sunday, between one and two o'clock,
she was bright and cheerful, and came towards
the entrance-gates to meet us. She, moreover,
displayed interest in all we told her
of our honeymoon in the Isle of Wight,
and of the places we had visited. Besides
that, I noticed that she took water with her
dinner.

If she'll only keep to it," said Hatch,
joining me in her unceremonious fashion as I
strolled in the garden later, smoking a cigar.

Yes, Mr. Charles, she's trying hard to put
bad habits away from her, and I hope she'll
be able to do it."

I hope and trust she will !"

Miss Brightman went back to Hastings
the day after the wedding-day," continued
Hatch ; ' but before she started she had a
long interview with my mistress, they two
shut up in missis's bedroom alone. For pretty
nigh all the rest of the day, my missis was
in tears, and she has not touched nothing
strong since."

Nothing at all !" I cried in surprise,
for it seemed too good to be true. " Why,
that's a fortnight ago ! More than a fortnight."


'well, it is so, Mr. Charles. Not but
that missis has tried as long and as hard
before now  and failed again."

It was Monday evening before I could
find time to go round to Lake's  and he did
not come to me. He was at home, poring
over some difficult law case by lamp-light.

Been in court all day, Charley," he

cried. " Have not had a minute to spare
for you."

' About Tom ?" I said, as I sat down.
You seemed to say that you had more
unpleasantness to tell me."

Aye, about Tom," he replied, turning
his chair to face me, and propping his right
elbow upon his table. " Well, I fear Tom
is in a bad way."

In health, you mean ?"

''I do. His cough is frightful, and he
is more like a skeleton than a livings behoof.
I should say the illness has laid hold of his
lungs."

Has he had a doctor ?"

'' No. Asks how he is to have one. Says a
doctor might (they were his own words) smell
a rat. Doctors are not called in to the class
of people lodging in that house unless they
are dying : and it would soon be seen by any
educated man that Tom is not of their kind.
My opinion is, that a doctor could not do
him much good now," added Lake.

He looked at me as he spoke ; to see, I

suppose, whether I took in his full meaning.
I did  unhappily.

'' And what do you think he is talking of
now, Charles ?" returned Lake. " Of giving
himself up."

Giving himself up ! What, to justice ?"

Lake nodded. " You know what Tom
Heriot is  not much like other people."

But why should he think of that ? It
would end everything."

'* I was on the point of asking him why,"
said Lake. " Whether I should have had
a satisfactory answer, I cannot say ; I should
think he could not give one ; but we were
interrupted. Miss Betsy Lee came in."

' Who ? What ?" I cried, starting from
my chair.

The young lady you told me of who
lives in Lambeth  Miss Betsy Lee. Sit
down, Charley. She came over to bring
him a pot of jelly."

Then he has let those people know where
he is Lake 1 Is he mad ?"

Mad as to carelessness," assented Lake.

I tell you Tom Heriot's not like other
people."

He will leave himself no chance."
She seems to be a nice, modest little
woman," said Lake ; " and I'll go bail her
visit was quite honest and proper. She had
made this jelly, she told Tom, and she and
her father hoped it would serve to strengthen
him, and her father sent his respects, and
hopes to hear that Captain Strange was
feeling better."

Well, Lake, the matter will get beyond
me," I said in despair. " Only a word
dropped, innocently, by these people in
some dangerous quarter, and where will
Tom be ?"

That's just it," said Lake. " Policeman
Wren is acquainted with them."
'' Did you leave the girl there ?"
No. Some rough man came into the
room smoking, and sat down, evidently with
the intention of making an evening of it ;
he lives in the same house and has made
acquaintance with Tom, or Tom with him.

So I said good-night, and the girl did the
same, and we went down together. ' Don't
you think Captain Strange looks very ill,
sir V said she as we got into the street.
 I'm afraid he does,' I answered. ' I'm sure
he does, sir,' she said.  It's a woeful pity
that somebody should be coming upon him
for a big back debt just now, obliging him
to keep quiet in a low quarter !' So that is
what Tom has told his Lambeth friends,"
concluded Lake.

Lake gave me the address in Southwark,
and I determined to see Tom the next evening.
In that, however, I was disappointed.
One of our oldest clients, passing through
London from the country on his way to Pau,
summoned me to him on the Tuesday evening.

But I went on Wednesday. The stars
were shining overhead as I traversed the
silent street, making out Tom's lodoinofs. He
had only an attic bedroom, I found, and I
went ujD to it. He was partly lying across
the bed when I entered.

I almost thought even then that I saw

death written in his face. White, wan,
shadowy it looked ; much changed, much
worn from what it was three weeks before.
But it lighted up with a smile, as he got upto
greet me.

Halloa, Charley 1" cried he. '' Best
congratulations ! Made yourself into a respectable
man. All good luck to yourself
and madam. I'm thinking of coming to
Essex Street to pay the wedding visit."

Thank you," said I, " but do be serious.
My coming here is a hazard, as you know,
Tom ; don't let us waste in nonsense the few
minutes I may stay."

'' Nonsense !" cried Tom. " Why, do
you think I should be afraid to venture to
Essex Street ?  what nonsense is there in
that ? Look here, Charley 1"

From some box in a dark corner of the
room, he got out an old big blue cloak lined
with red, and swung it on. The collar, made
of some black curly wool, stood up above his
ears. He walked about the small room, exhibiting
himself

Would the sharpest officer in Scotland
Yard take me for anyone but old Major
Carlenn ?" laughed he. " I'm sure I look
like his double in this elegant cloak. It was
his, once."

His ! What, Major Carlenn's ?"

Just so. He made me a present of it."

' You have seen him, then !"

I sent for him," answered Tom, putting
off the old cloak and coughing painfully after
his recent exertion. '' I thought I should
like to see the old fellow ; I was not afraid
he'd betray me ; Carlenn would not do that ;
and I dropped a quiet note to his club,
taking the chance of his being in town."

Taking the chance ! Suppose he had
not been in town, Tom, and the note had
fallen into wrong hands  some inquisitive
waiter, let us say, who chose to open
it?"

Well  what then ? A waiter would
only turn up his nose at Mr. Dominic Turk,
the retired schoolmaster, and close up the
note again for the Major."

And what would Major Carlenn make of
Mr. Dominic Turk ?"

Major Carlenn would know my handwriting,
Charley."

And he came in answer to it ?"

He came : and blew me uj) in a loud
and awful fashion ; seemed to be trying to
blow the ceiling off. First, he threatened
to go out and bring in the police ; next, he
vowed he would go straight to Blanche and
tell her all. Finally, he calmed down and
promised to send me one of his cast-off
cloaks to disguise me, in case I had to go
into the streets. Isn't it a beauty ?"

' Well, now, Tom, if you can be serious
for once, what is going to become of you,
and what is to be done ? I've come to
know."

Wish I could tell you ; don't know myself,"
said he lightly.

What was it you said to Lake about
giving yourself up ?"

Upon my word of honour, Charley, I
sometimes feel inclined to do it. I couldn't

be much worse off in prison than I am here.
Sick and sad, lad, needing comforts that can't
be had in such a place as this ; no one to see
after me, no one to attend to me. Anyway,
it would end the suspense."

I sat turning things about in my mind.
It all seemed so full of hazard. That he
must be got away from his present quarters
was certain. I told him so.

But you are so recklessly imprudent,
you see, Tom," I observed, ' and it increases
the risk. You have had Miss Betsy Lee
here."

Tom fluno himself back with a lauofh.
'' She has been here twice, the good little
soul. The old man came once."

Don't you think you might as well take
up your standing tomorrow on the top of
the Monument, and proclaim yourself to the
public at large ? You try me greatly,
Tom I"

Try you because I see the Lees ! Come,
Charley, that's good. They are as safe as
you are."

' In intention perhaps. How came you
to let them know you were to be found
here ?"

How came I ?" he carelessly rejoined.
Let's see ? Oh, I remember. One
evening when I was hipped, fit to die of it
all and of the confinement to this wretched
room, I strolled out. My feet took me to
the old ground  Lambeth  and to Lee's.
He chanced to see me, and invited me in.
Over some whisky and water, I opened out
my woes to them ; not of course the truth,
but as near as might be. Told them of a
curmudgeon creditor of past days that I
feared was coming down upon me, so that I
had to be in close hiding for a bit."

But you need not have told them
where."

Oh, they'll be cautious. Miss Betsy
was so much struck with my cough and my
looks that she said she should make some
jelly for me, of the kind she used to make
for her mother before she died ; and the
good little girl has brought me some over

here twice in a jar. They are all right,
Charley."

It was of no use contending with him.
After sitting a little time longer, I promised
that he should shortly see me again or hear
from me, and took my departure. Full of
doubt and trouble, I wanted to be alone,
to decide, if possible, what was to be
done.

What to do about Tom I knew not. That
he required nursing and nourishment, and
that he ought to be moved where he could
have it, was indisputable. But  the risk !

Three-parts of the night I lay awake,
thinking of different plans. None seemed
feasible. In the morning I was hardly fit
for my day's work, and set to it with unsteady
nerves and a worried brain. If I had only
someone to consult with, some capable man
who would help me ! I did think of Mr.
Serjeant Stillingfar ; but I knew he would
not like it, would probably refuse advice.
One who now and again sat in the position
of judge, sentencing men himself, would

scarcely choose to aid in concealing an
escaped convict.

I was upstairs in the dining-room at one
o'clock, taking luncheon with Annabel, when
the door was thrown back by Watts and
there loomed into the room the old blue
cloak with the red lining. For a moment I
thought it was the one I had seen the past
night in Southwark, and my heart leaped
into my mouth. Watts's quiet announcement
dispelled the alarm.

Major Carlenn, sir."

The Major unclasped his cloak after
shaking hands with us, and flung it across
the sofa, just as Tom had flung his on the
bed. I pointed to the cold beef, and asked
if he would take some.

Don't mind if I do, Charles," said he,
drawing a chair to the table : ' I'm too
much bothered just now to eat as I ought.
A pretty kettle of fish this is, lad, that you
and I have had brought upon us !"

I gave him a warning look, glancing at
Annabel. The old fellow understood me 

VOL. in. 47

she had not been trusted with the present
trouble. That Tom Heriot had effected his
escape, Annabel knew ; that it was expected
he would make his way home, she knew ;
but that he had long been here, and was now
close at hand, I had never told her. Why
inflict upon her the suspense I had to endure ?

Rather a chilly day for the time of
year," observed the Major, as he coughed
down his previous words. ' Just a little,
Mrs. Strange ; underdone, please."

Annabel, who carved at luncheon-time,
helped him carefully. " And what kettle
of fish is it that you and Charles are troubled
with. Major ?" she inquired, smiling.

 Ah  aw  don't care to say much about
it," answered the Major, more ready at an
excuse than I should have deemed him.
Blanche is up to her ears in anger against
Level ; says she'll get a separation from him,
and all that kind of nonsense. But you and
I may as well not make it our business,
Charles, I expect : better let married folk
fight out their own battles. And have you

heard from your Aunt Lucy yet, Mrs.
Strange ?" -

So the subject was turned off for the
time ; but down below, in my office, the
Major went at it tooth and nail, talking himself
into a fever. All the hard names in
the Major's vocabulary were hurled at Tom.
His original sin was disgraceful enough,
never to be condoned, said the Major ; but
his present imprudent procedure was worse,
and desperately wicked.

' Are Blanche and her husband still at
variance ?" I asked, when he had somewhat
cooled down on the other subject.

 They just are, and are likely to remain
so," growled the Major. " It's Blanche's
fault. Men have ways of their own, and
she's a little fool for wishing to interfere
with his. Don't let your wife begin that,
Charles ; it's my best advice to you. You
are laughing, young fellow ! Well, perhaps
you and Level don't row in quite the same
boat ; but you can't foresee the shoals you
may pitch into. No one can."

47  2

We were interrupted by Lennard, who
had come back on the previous day, pale
and pulled down by his sharp attack of
illness, but the same efficient man of business
as ever. A telegram had been delivered,
which he could not deal with without me.

' I'll be off, then," said the Major ; ' I
suppose I'm only hindering work. And I
wish you well through your difficulties,
Charles," he added significantly. '' I wish
all of us well through them. Good-day,
Mr. Lennard."

The Major was ready enough to wish
that, but he could not suggest any means
by which it might be accomplished. I had
asked him ; and he confessed himself incompetent
to advise. " I should send him
off to sea in a whaling-boat and keep him
there," was all the help he gave.

Lennard stayed beyond time that evening,
and was ready in my private room to go over
certain business with me that had transpired
during my own absence. I could not give
the necessary attention to it, try as earnestly

as I would : Tom and his business kept
dancing in my brain to the exclusion of other
things. Lennard asked me whether I was
ill.

'' No," I answered ; " at least, not in
body." And as I spoke, the thought
crossed me to confide the trouble to Lennard.
He had seen too much trouble himself
not to be safe and cautious, and perhaps
he might suggest something.

' Let Captain Heriot come to me," he
immediately said. ' He could not be safer
anywhere. Sometimes we let our drawing-room
floor ; it is vacant now, and he can
have it. My wife and my daughter Charlotte
will attend to his comforts and nurse
him, if that may be, into health. It is the
best thing that can be done with him, Mr.
Charles."

I saw that it was, seeming to discern all
the advantages of the proposal at a grasp,
and accepted it. We consulted as to how
best to effect Tom's removal, which Lennard
himself undertook. I dropped a hasty note

to " Mr. Turk " to prepare him to be in
readiness the following evening, and Lennard
posted it when he went out. He had no
sooner gone, than the door of my private
room slowly opened, and, rather to my surprise,
Leah appeared.

I beg your pardon, sir, for presuming
to disturb you here," she said ; " but I can't
rest. There's some great trouble afloat ;
I've seen it in your looks and ways, sir, ever
since Sunday. Yom* face couldn't deceive
me when you were my little nursling.
Master Charles, and it can't deceive me
now. Is it about Mr. Tom ?"

Well, yes, it is, Leah."

Her face turned white. " He has not
got himself taken, surely !"

'' No ; it's not so bad as that  yet."

'' Thank Heaven for it !" she returned.
1 knew it was him, and I'm aU in a twitter
about him from morning till night. I can't
sleep or eat for dreading the news that any
moment may bring of him. It seems to me,
Mr. Charles, that one must needs be forever

in a twitter in this world ; before one
trouble is mended, another turns up. No
sooner am I a bit relieved about poor Nancy,
that unfortunate daughter of mine, than
there comes Mr. Tom."

The relief that Leah spoke of was this :
some relatives of Leah's former husband,
Nancy's father, had somehow got to hear of
Nancy's misfortunes. Instead of turning
from her, they had taken her and her cause
in hand, and had settled her and her three
children in a general shop in Hampshire
near to themselves, where she was already
beginning to earn enough for a good living.
The man who was the cause of all the mischief
had emigrated, and meant never to
return to Europe.

And Leah had taken my advice in the
matter, and disclosed all to Watts. He was
not in the least jut out by it, as she had
feared he would be ; only told her she was a
simpleton for not having told him before.

WITH MR. JONES.

Y DEAR CHARLES, I parum
1 circularly wish you to come to
cisT-1-, J Yit some leoal advice,

me.

and I would rather you acted for me than
anyone else. Come up this morning, please.
'' Your affectionate sister,

'' Blanche."

The above note, brought from Gloucester
Place on Monday morning by one of Lady
Level's servants, reached me before ten
o'clock. By the dashing character of the
handwriting, I judged that Blanche had
not been in the calmest temper when she
penned it.

Is Lord Level at home ?" I inquired of
the man Sanders.

'* No, sir. His lordship went down to
Marshdale yesterday evening. A telegram
came for him, and I think it was in consequence
of that he went."

I wrote a few words to Blanche, tellings
her I would be with her as soon as I could,
and sent it by Sanders.

But a lawyer's time is not always his
own. One client after another kept coming
in that morning, as if on purpose ; and it
was half-past twelve in the day when I
reached Gloucester Place.

The house in Gloucester Place was, and
had been for some little time now, entirely
rented by Lord Level of Major Carlenn.
The Major, when in London, had rooms in
Seymour Street, but lived chiefly at his club.

'' Her ladyship has gone out, sir," was
Sanders's greeting to me, when he answered
my ring at the door-bell.

'' Gone out r

' Just gone," confirmed Major Carlenn,

who was there, it seemed, and came forward
in the wake of Sanders. " Come in, Charles."

He turned into the dining-room, and I
after him. " Blanche ought to have waited
in," I remarked. " I have come up at the
greatest inconvenience."

'' She has gone off in a tantrum," cried
the Major, lowering his voice as he carefully
closed the door and pushed a chair towards
me, just as if the house were still in his
occupancy.

But where has she gone ?" I asked, not
taking the chair, but standing with my elbow
on the mantelpiece.

Who's to know ? To you, in Essex
Street, I shouldn't wonder. She was on the
heights of impatience at your not coming."

Not to Essex Street, I think. Major.
I should have seen her."

Nonsense ! There's fifty turnings and
windings between this and Essex Street,
where you might miss one another ; your
cab taking the straight way and she the
crooked," retorted the Major. " When

Blanche gets her back up, you can't easily
put it down."

'' Something has gone contrary, I expect."

'' Nothing has gone contrary but herself,"
replied the Major, who seemed in a
cross and contrary mood on his own part.
Women are the very deuce for folly."

Well, what is it all about, sir ? I suppose
you can tell me ?"

The Major sat down in Lord Level's easy-chair,
pushed back his cloak, and prepared
to explain.

What it's all about is just nothing,
Charles ; but so far as Madam Blanche's
version goes, it is this," said he. " They
were about to sit down, yesterday evening,
to dinner  which they take on Sundays at
five o'clock (good, pious souls !), and limit
their fare to roast beef and a tart  when a
telegram arrived from Marshdale. My lord
seemed jmt out about it ; my lady was no
doubt the same. ' I must go down at once,
Blanche,' said he, speaking on the spur of
the moment. ' But why ? Where's the

need of it ?' returned she. ' Surely there
can be nothing at Marshdale to call you
away on Sunday and in this haste V ' Yes
said he, ' there is ; there's illness.' And
then, Blanche says, he tried to cough down
the words, as if he had made a slip of the
tongue. ' Who is ill ?' said Blanche. ' Let
me see the telegram.' Level slid the telegram
into his pocket, and told her it was
Mr. Edwards, the old steward. Down he
sat again at the table, swallowed a mouthful
of beef, sent Sanders to put up a few things
in his small portmanteau, and was off in a
cab like the wind. Fact is," added the
Major, '' had he failed to catch that particular
train, he would not have got down
at all, being Sunday ; and Sanders says that
catching it must have been a near shave for
his lordship."

Is that all ?"

No. This morning there was delivered
here a letter for his lordship ; post-mark
Marshdale, handwriting* a certain Italian one
that Blanche has seen before. She has seen

the writer, too, it seems  a fair lady called
Nina. Blanche argues that as the letter
came from Marshdale, the lady must be at
Marshdale, and she means to know without
delay, she says, who and what this damsel
is, and what the tie may be that binds her
to Lord Level and gives her the right to
pursue him, as she does, and the power to
influence his movements, and to be at her
beck and call. The probability is," added
the shrewd Major, " that this person wrote
to him on the Saturday, but, being a
foreigner, was not aware that he would not
receive her letter on Sunday morning.
Finding that he did not arrive at Marsh-dale
on the Sunday, and the day getting on,
she despatched the telegram. That's how I
make it out, Charles ; I don't know if I am
right."

You think, then, that some Italian lady
is at Marshdale ?"

Sure of it," returned the Major. " I've
heard of it before to-day. Expect she lives
there, making journeys to her own land between

whiles, no doubt. The best and the
worst of us get homesick."

You mean that she Ives there in  in 
well, in a manner not quite orthodox, and
that Lord Level connives at it ?"

Connives at it !" echoed the old reprobate.
" Why, he is at the top and bottom
of it. Level's a man of the world, always
was, and does as the world does. And that
little ignorant fool, Blanche, ferrets out some
inkling of this, and goes and sets up a fuss !
Level's as good a husband to her as can
be, and yet she's not content ! Commend
me to foolish women ! They are all
alike !"

In his indignation against women in
general. Major Carlenn rose from his chair
and began striding up and down the room.
I was pondering on what he had said to me.

What right have wives to rake up particulars
of their husbands' private affairs ?"
he demanded fiercely. " If Level does go
off to Marshdale for a few days' sojourn now
and again, is it any business of Blanche's

what he goes for, or what he does there, or
whom he sees ? Suppose he chose to maintain
a whole menagerie of  of  Italian
monkeys there, ought Blanche to interfere
and make bones over it ?"

- But "

He does not offend her ; he does not
allow her to see that anything exists to offend
her : why, then, should she suspect this and
suspect that, and peep and peer after Level
as if she were a detective told off expressly
to watch his movements ?" continued the
angry man. " Only an ignorant girl would
dream of doing it. I am sick of her folly."

Well now. Major Carlenn, will you listen
to me for a moment ?" I said, speaking quietly
and calmly as an antidote to his heat. " I
don't believe this. I think you and Blanche
are both mistaken."

He brought himself to an anchor on the
hearth rug, and stared at me under his thick,
grizzled eyebrows. " What is it that you
don't believe, Charles ?"

'' This that you insinuate about Marsh-dale.

I have faith in Lord Level ; I like
Lord Level ; and I think you are misjudging
him."

Oh, indeed !" responded the Major. " I
suppose you know what a wild blade Level
always was ?"

In his early days he may have been.
But you may depend upon it that when
he married he left his wild ways behind
him."

All right, young Charles. And, upon
my word, you are pretty near as young in
the world's depths as Blanche herself is,"
was the Major's sarcastic remark. '' Do
you wish to tell me there's nothing up at
Marshdale, with all these mysterious telegrams
to Level, and his scampers back in
answer ? Come !"

I admit that there seems to be some
mystery at Marshdale. Something that we
do not understand, and that Lord Level
does not intend us to understand ; but I
must have further proof before I can believe
it is of any such nature as you hint it. Major.

For a long time past, Lord Level has appeared
to me like a man in trouble ; as if he
had some anxiety on his mind."

Well," acquiesced the Major equably,
' and what can trouble a man's mind more
than the exactions of these foreign syrens ?
Let them be Italian, or Spanish, or French
what you will  they'll worry your life out
of you in the long-run. What does that
Italian girl do at Marshdale ?"

I cannot say. For my own part I do
not know that one is there. But if she be,
if there be a whole menagerie of Italian
ladies there, as you have just expressed it.
Major "

I said a menagerie of monkeys," he
growled.

Monkeys, then. But whether they be
monkeys or whether they be ladies, I feel
convinced that Lord Level is acting no unworthy
part  that he is loyal to his
wife."

You had better tell her so," nodded the
Major ; " perhaps she'll believe you. I told

VOL. III. 48

her the opposite. I told her that when
women marry gay and attractive men, they
must look out for squalls, and learn to shut
their eyes a bit in going through life. I
bade her bottle uj) her fancies, and let
Marshdale and her husband alone, and not
show herself a simpleton before the public."

' What did she say to that ?"

Say ? It was that piece of advice which
raised the storm. She burst out of the
room like a maniac, declaring she wouldn't
remain in it to listen to me. The next thing
was, I heard the street-door bang, and saw
my lady go out, putting on her gloves as
she went. You came up two minutes afterwards."


I was buried in thought ao-ain. He stood
staring at me, as if I had no business to
have any thought.

Look here, Major : one thing strikes me
forcibly : the very fact of Lord Level allowing
these telegrams to come to him openly
is enough to prove that matters are not as
you and Blanche suspect. If "

' How can a telegram come secretly ?"
interrupted the Major.

He would take care that they did not
come at all  to his house."

Oh, would he ?" cried the old reprobate.
I should like to know how he could hinder
it if any she-fiend chooses to send them."

Rely upon it he would hinder it. Level
is not one to be coerced against his will by
either man or woman. Have you any idea
how long Blanche will remain out ?"

' Just as much as you have, Charley.
She may remain away till night, for all I
know."

It was of no use, then, my staying longer ;
and time, that day, was almost as precious tome
as gold. Major Carlenn threw on his
cloak, and we went out together.

I should not wonder if my young lady
has gone to Seymour Street," remarked the
Major. ' The thought has just occurred tome.


'' To your lodgings, you mean ?" I asked,
thinking it very unlikely.

48  2

Yes ; Mrs. Guy is there. The poor
old thing arrived from Jersey on Saturday.
She has come over on her usual errand  to
consult the doctors ; grows more ridiculously
fanciful as she grows older. You might just
look in upon her now, Charles ; it's close by :
and then you'll see whether Blanche is there
or not."

I spared a few minutes for it. Poor Mrs.
Guy looked very poorly indeed ; but she
was meek and mild as ever, and burst into
tears as I greeted her. Her ailments I
promised to go and hear all about another
time. Yes, Blanche was there. When we
went in, she was laughing at something
Mrs. Guy had said, and her indignation
seemed to have subsided.

I could not stay long. Blanche came outwith
me, thinking I should go back with
her to Gloucester Place. But that was
impossible ; I had already wasted more time
than I could well spare. Blanche was
vexed.

My dear, you should not have gone out

when you were expecting me. You know
how very much I am occupied."

Papa vexed me, and drove me to it,"
she answered. '' He said  oh, such wicked
things, that I could not and would not stay
to listen. And all the while I knew it was
not that he believed them, but that he wanted
to make excuses for Lord Level."

I did not contradict her. Let her retain,
an she could, some little veneration for her
step-father.

Charles, I want to have a long conversation
with you, so you must come to meas
soon as you can," she said. " I mean to
have a separation from my husband ; perhaps
a divorce, and I want you to tell me how I
must proceed in it. I did think of applying
to Jennings and Ward, Lord Level's solicitors,
but, perhaps, you will be best."

I laughed. " You don't suppose, do
you, Blanche, that Lord Level's solicitors
would act for you against him."

Now, Charles, you are speaking lightly ;
you are making game of me. Why do you

laugh ? I can tell you it is more serious
than you may think for ! and I am serious.
I have talked of this for a long time, and
now I till act. How shall I begin ?"

Do not begin at all, Blanche," I said,
with earnestness. " Do nothing. Were your
father living  were your mother living, they
would both give you this advice  and this
is not the first time I have enjoined it on
sou. Ah, my dear, you do not know  you
little guess what misery to the wife such a
climax as this which you propose would
involve."

Blanche had turned to the railings round
the interior of Portman Square, and halted
there, apparently looking at the shrubs. Her
eyes were full of tears.

On the other hand, Charles, you do
not know, you cannot guess, what I have
to bear  what a misery it makes of my
life."

* Are you sure of the facts that make the
misery ?"

' Why, of course I am."

I think not, Blanche. I think you are
mistaken."

She turned to me in surprise. '' But I
cant be mistaken," she said. " How can I
be ? If Lord Level does not go to Marsh-dale
to  to  to see people, what does he go

for r

He may go for something quite different.
My dear, I have more confidence in your
husband than you have, and I think you are
Avrongf. I must be off: I've not another
moment ; but these are my last words to
you, Blanche.  Take no action. Be still.
Do nothing J'

By half-past four o'clock, the most
pressing of my work was over for the day,
and then I took a cab to Lincoln's Inn to
see Mr. Serjeant Stillingfar. He had often
said to me, good old uncle that he was:
Come to me always, Charles, when you are
in any legal doubt or difficulty, or deem that
my opinion may be of use to you." I was
in one of those difficulties now. Some remarkably
troublesome business had been laid

before me by a client ; I could not see my
way in it at all, and was taking it to Serjeant
Stillingfar.

The old chambers were just as they used
to be ; as they were on the day which the
reader has heard of, when I saw them for
the first time. Running up the stairs, there
sat a clerk at the desk in the narrow room,
where young Lake, full of impudence, had
sat that day, Mr. Jones's empty place beside
it now, as it was then.

Is the Serjeant in ?" I asked the clerk.

'' No, sir ; he's not out of Court yet. Mr.
Jones is in."

I went on to the inner room. Old Jones,
the Serjeant's own especial clerk, was writing
at his little desk in the corner. Nothing
was changed ; not even old Jones himself
He was not, to appearance, a day older, and
not an ounce bigger. Lake used to tell him
he would make his fortune if he went about
the country in a caravan and called himself
a consumptive lamp-jost.

My uncle is not back from Court, Graham

says," I observed to the clerk, after shaking
hands.

Not yet," he answered. " I don't think
he'll be honos. Sit down, Mr. Strano;-e."

I took the chair I had taken that first day
years ago, and waited. Mr. Jones finished
the writings he was about, arranged his
papers, and then came and stood with his
back to the fire, having kept his quill in his
hand. It must be a very hot day indeed
which did not see a fire in that grate.

If the Serjeant is not back speedily, I
think I must open my business to you, and
get your opinion, Mr. Jones," I said. " I
dare say you could give me one as well ashe."


Some complicated case that you can't
quite manage ?" he rejoined.

It's the most complicated, exasperating
case I nearly ever had brought to me," I
answered. ' I think it is a matter more fora
detective officer to deal with than a
solicitor. If Serjeant Stillingfar says the
same, I shall throw it up."

Curious things, some of those detective
cases," remarked Mr. Jones, gently waving
his pen.

They are. I wouldn't have to deal
with them, as a detective, for the world.
Shall I relate this case to you ?"

He took out his watch and looked at it.
' Better wait a bit longer, Mr. Charles. I
expect the Serjeant ever" minute now."

Don't you wonder that my uncle continues
to work ?" I cried presently. " He
is old now. / should retire."

He is sixty-five. If you were not young
yourself, you would not call that old."

Old enough, I should say, for work to
be a labour to him."

A labour that he loves, and that he is
as capable of performing as he was twenty
years ago," returned old Jones. " No, Mr.
Charles, I do not wonder that he should
continue to work."

Did you know that he had been offered
a judgeship ?"

Old Jones laughed a little. I thought it

was as much as to say there was Utile which
concerned the Serjeant that he did not
know.

He has been offered a judgeship more
than once  had it pressed upon him, Mr.
Charles. The last time was when Mr.
Baron Charlton died."

Why ! that is only a month or two
ago !

Just about nine weeks, I fancy."

'' And he declined it ?"

' He declines them all."

'' But what can be his motive ? It would
give him more rest than he enjoys now "

I don't altogether know that," interrupted
the clerk. " The judges are very
much over-worked now. It would increase
his responsibility ; and he is one to feel that,
perhaps painfully."

You mean when he had to pass the
dread sentence of death. A new judge must
always feel that at the beginning."

I heard one of our present judges say 
it was in this room, too, Mr. Charles  that

the first time he put on the black cap he
never closed his eyes the whole night after
it. All the Bench are not so sensitive as
that, you know."

A thought suddenly struck me. ' Surely,"
I cried, ' you do not mean that that is the
reason for my uncle's refusing a seat on the
Bench !"

Not at all. He'd get over that in time,
as others do. Oh no ! that has nothing todo
with it."

* Then I really cannot see what can have
to do with it. It would give him a degree
of rest ; yes, it would ; and it would give
him rank and position."

But it would take from him half his
income. Yes, just about half, I reckon,"
repeated Mr. Jones, attentively regarding
the feather of the pen.

'' What of that ? He must be putting
by heaps and heaps of money  and he has
neither wife nor child to put by for,"

'' Ah !" said the clerk, " that is just how
we all are apt to judge of a neighbour's

business. Would it surprise you very much,
sir, if I told you that the Serjeant is not
putting by ?"

But he must be putting by. Or what
becomes of his money ?"

He spends it, Mr. Charles."

'' Spends it ! Upon what ?"

Upon other people."

]mr. Jones looked at me from across the
hearth rug, and I looked at him. The assertion
puzzled me.

'' It's true," he said with a nod. " You
have not forgotten that great calamity which
happened some ten or twelve years ago, Mr.
Charles ? That bank which went to pieces,
and broke up homes and hearts ? Fo/?'
money went in it."

As if I could forget that !

The Serjeant's money, all he had then
saved, went in it," continued the clerk.
Mortifying enough, of course, but he was
in the full swing of his prosperity, and could
soon have replaced it. What he could not
so easily replace, Mr. Charles, was the money

he had been the means of placing in the
bank belonging to other people, and which
was lost. He had done it for the best. He
held the bank to be thoroughly sound and
prosperous ; he could not have had more
confidence in his own integrity than he had
in that bank ; and he had counselled friends
and others whom he knew, who were not as
well off as he was, to invest all they could
spare in it, believing he was doing them
a kindness. Instead of that, it ruined
them."

I thought I saw what the clerk was
coming to. After a pause, he want on :

' It is these people that he has been
working for, Mr. Charles. Some of them
he has entirely repaid  the money, you
know, which he caused them to lose. He
considered it his duty to recompense them,
so far as he could ; and to keep them, where
they needed to be kept, until he had effected
that. For those who were better off and
did not need present help, he put money by
as he could spare it, investing it in the funds

in their name : I dare say your name is
amongst them. That's what Mr. Serjeant
StiUingfar does with his income, and that's
why he keeps on working."

I had never suspected this.

I believe it is ahiiost accomplished now,"
said the clerk. ' So nearly that I thought
he might, perhaps, have taken the judgeship
on this last occasion. But he did not.
Just a few months longer in harness, Jones,'

he said to me, ' and then V So I reckon

that we shall yet see him on the Bench, Mr.
Charles."

He must be very good."

' Good !" echoed old Jones, with emotion ;
*' he is made of goodness. There are few
people like him. He would help the whole
world if he could. I don't believe there's
any man who has ever done a single service
for him of the most trifling nature but he
would wish to place beyond the reach of
poverty. ' I've put a trifle by for you,
Jones,' he said to me the other day, ' in case
you might be at a loss for another such place

as this when my tie's over.' And when I
tried to thank him "

Mr. Jones broke down. Bringing the
quill pen under his eyes, as if he suddenly
caught sight of a flaw thereon, I saw a drop
of water fall on to it.

Yes, Mr. Charles, he said that to me.
It has taken a load from my mind. When
a man is on the downhill of life and is not
sure of his future, he can't help being
anxious. The Serjeant has paid me a liberal
salary, as you may well guess, but he knows
that it has not been in my power to put by
a fraction of it. ' You are too generous
with your money, Serjeant,' I said to him
one day, a good while ago. * Ah no, Jones,
not at all,' he answered. ' God has prospered
me so marvellously in these later years,
what can I do but strive to prosper others ?'
Those were his very words."

And with these last words of Jones's our
conference came to an end. The door was
abruptly thrown open by Graham to admit
the Serjeant. Mr. Jones helped him off with

his wig and gown, and handed him the Httle
flaxen top that he wore when not on duty.
Then Jones, leaving the room for a few
moments, came back with a glass of milk,
which he handed to his master.

'' Would not a glass of wine do you more
good, uncle ?" I asked.

No, lad ; not so much. A glass of milk
after a hard day's work in Court refreshes
me. I never touch wine except at a dinner.
I take a little then ; not much."

Sitting down together when Mr. Jones
had again left us, I opened my business to
the Serjeant as concisely as possible. He
listened attentively, but made no remark
until the end.

Now go over it all again, Charles."

I did so : and this second time I was
repeatedly interrupted by remarks or questions.
After that we discussed the case.

' I cannot see any reason why you should
not take up the matter," he said, when he
had given it a little silent consideration. ' I
do not look upon it quite as you do ; I think

VOL. III. 49

you have formed a wrong judgment. It is
intricate at present ; I grant you that ; but
if you proceed in the manner I have suggested,
you will unravel it."

'' Thank you, Uncle Stillingfar. I can
never thank you enough for all your kindness
to mei(

Were you so full of anxiety over this
case ?" he asked, as we were shaking hands,
and I was about to leave. '' You look as
though you had a weight of it on your
brow."

And so I have, uncle ; but not about
this case. Something nearer home."

What is it ?" he returned, looking at
me.

'' It is Perhaps I had better not

tell it you."

I understand," he slowly said. '' Tom
Heriot, I suppose. Why does he not get

nil

away i

'' He is too ill for that at present : confined
to his room and his bed. Of course,
he does not run quite so great a risk as he

did when he persisted in parading the streets,
but danger is always imminent."

'' He ought to end the danger by getting
away. Very ill, is he ?"

So ill that I think danger will soon be
all at an end in another way ; it certainly
will be unless he rallies."

'' What is the matter with him ?"

*' I cannot help fearing that consumption
has set in."

Poor fellow ! Oh, Charles, how that
fine young man has spoilt his life ! Consumption
?  Wait a bit  let me think,"
broke oJ0P the Serjeant. " Why, yes, I
remember now ; it was consumption that
Colonel Heriot's first wife died of  Tom's
mother."

' Tom said so the last time I saw him."

' Ah. He knows it, then. Better not
see him too often, Charles. You are running
a risk yourself, as you must be aware."

Yes ; I know I am. It is altogether a
trial. Good-day, uncle."

I shook hands with Jones as I passed

49  2

through his room, and ran do\Yn the stairs,
feeing all the better for my interview with
him and with his patron, Mr. Serjeant
Stillingfar.

AN ACCIDENT.

HE drawing-room floor at Lennard's
made very comfortable quarters for
Tom Heriot, and his removal from
the room in South work had been accomplished
without difficulty. Mrs. Lennard, a patient,
mild, weak woman, who could never have
been strong - minded, made him an excellent
nurse, her more practical and very
capable daughter, Charlotte, aiding her when
necessary.

A safer refuse could not have been found
in London. The Lennards were so often
under a cloud themselves as regarded pecuniary
matters, so beset at times by their

unwelcome creditors  the butcher, baker
and grocer  that the chain of their front
door was kept habitually fastened, and no
one was admitted within its portals without
being first of all subjected to a comprehensive
survey. Had some kind friend
made a rush to the perambulating policeman
of the district, to inform him that the
domicile of those Lennards was again in a
state of siege, he would simply have speculated
upon whether the enemy was this time
the landlord or the Queen's taxes. It chanced
to be neither ; but it was well for the besieged
to favour the impression that it was
one or the other, or both. Policemen do
not wage war with unfortunate debtors, and
Mr. Lennard's house was as safe as a remote
castle.

Mr. Brown " Tom was called there ;
none of the household, with the exception of
its master, having any idea that it was not
his true name. '' One of the gentlemen
clerks in Essex Street, who has no home
in London ; I have undertaken to receive

him while he is ill," Mr. Lennard had carelessly
remarked to his wife and daughters
before introducing Tom. They had unsuspecting
minds, except as regarded their
own creditors, those ladies  ladies always,
though fallen from their former state  and
never thought to question the statement, or
to be at all surprised that Mr. Strange himself
took an interest in his clerk's illness,
and paid an evening visit to him now and
then. The doctor who was called in, a hard-worked
practitioner named Purfleet, did his
best for " Mr. Brown," but had no time to
spare for curiosity about him in any other
way, or to give so much as a thought to his
antecedents.

And just at first, after being settled at
Lennard's, Tom Heriot seemed to be taking
a turn for the better. The warmth of the
comfortable rooms, the care given to him,
the strengthening diet, and perhaps a feeling
that he was in a safer asylum than he had yet
found, all had their effect upon him for good.

Hatch !" called out Mrs. Brightman.

Hatch ran in from the next room. " Yes,
ma'am."

Let Perry go and tell the gardener to
cut some of his best grapes, white and
purple, and do you arrange them in a
basket. I shall go up to Essex Street and
see my daughter this afternoon, and will
take them to her. Order the carriage for
half-past two o'clock."

Miss Annabel will be finely pleased to
see you, ma'am !" remarked Hatch.

Possibly so. But she is no longer Miss
Annabel. Go and see about the grapes."

When Mrs. Brightman's tones were cold
and haughty, and they sounded especially
sho just now, she brooked no dilatoriness in
those who had to obey her behests. Hatch
turned away immediately, and went along
talking to herself

She's getting cross and restless again.
I'm certain of it. In a week's time from
this we shall have her as bad as before. And
for ever so many weeks now she has been as

cautious and sober as a judge ! Hang the
drink, then ! Doctors may well call it a
disease when it comes to this stage with
people. Here  I say, Perry !"

The butler, passing along the hall, heard
Hatch's call, and stopped. She gave her
cap-strings a fling backwards as she advanced
to him.

You are to go and tell Church to cut a
basket of grapes, and to mix 'em, white and
black. The very best and ripest that is in
the greenhouse ; they be for Miss Annabel."

All right, I'll go at once," answered
Perry. " But you need not snap a man's
nose ofi*. Hatch, or look as if you were going
to eat him. What has put you out ?"

Enough has put me out ; and you might
know that, old Perry, if you had any sense,"
retorted Hatch. " When do I snap people's
noses ofl:*  which it's my tone, I take it, that
you mean  except I'm that bothered and
worried I can't speak sweet ?"

Well, what's amiss ?" asked Perry.

They were standing close together, and

Hatch lowered her voice to a whisper.
' The missis is going off again ; I be certain
sure on't."

No r cried Perry, full of dismay. " But,
look here, Hatch "  suddenly diving into
one of his pockets  '' she can't have done
it ; here's the cellar-key. I can be upon
my word that there's not a drain of anything
out."

'' You always did have the brains of a
turkey, you know, Perry," was Hatch's
gracious rejoinder ; ' and I'm tired of reminding
you of it. Who said missis had took
anything ? Not me. She haven't  yet.
As you observe, there's nothing up for her
to take. But she'll be ordering you to bring
something up before tomorrow's over ; perhaps
before to-day is."

Dear, dear 1" lamented the faithful servant.
" Don't you think you may be mistaken,
Hatch ? What do you judge by ?"

I judge by herself I've not lived with
my missis all these years without learning
to notice sirens and tokens. Her manner

to-day and her restlessness is just as plain
as the sun in the sky. I know what it
means, and you'll know it too, as soon as
she gives you her orders to unlock the
cellar."

' Can nothing be done?" cried the unhappy
Perry. " Could I lose the key of the cellar,
do you think, Hatch ? Would that be of
any good ?"

It would hold good just as long as you'd
be in getting a hammer and poker to break
it open with ; you've not got to deal with
a pack of schoolboys that's under control,"
was Hatch's sarcastic reproof " But I think
there's one thing we might try. Perry, and
that is, run round to Mr. Close and tell him
about it. Perhaps he could give her something
to stop the craving."

I'll go," said Perry. " I'll slip round
when I've told Church about the grapes."

And the carriage is ordered early 
half-past two ; so mind you are in readiness,"
concluded Hatch.

Perry went to the surgeon's, after delivering

his orders to the gardener. But Mr.
Close was not at home, and the man came
away again without leaving any message ;
he did not choose to enter upon the subject
with Mr. Dunn, the assistant. The latter
inquired who was ill, and Perry replied that
nobody was ; he had only come to steak a
private word to Mr. Close, which could wait.
In point of fact, he meant to call later.

But the curiosity of Mr. Dunn, who was
a very inquisitive young man, fonder of
attending to other people's business than of
doing his own, had been aroused by this.
He considered Perry's manner rather mysterious,
as well as the suppression of the
message, and he enlarged upon the account
to Mr. Close when he came in. Mr. Close
made no particular rejoinder ; but in his
own mind he felt little doubt that Mrs.
Brightman was breaking out again, and
determined to go and see her when he had
had his dinner.

Perry returned home, and waited on his
mistress at luncheon, quaking inwardly all

the time, as he subsequently confessed to
Hatch, lest she should ask him for something
that was not upon the table. However,
she did not do so ; but she was very
restless, as Perry observed ; ate little, drank
no water, and told Perry to bring her a cup)
of coffee.

At half-jDast two the carriage stood at the
gate, the silver on the horses' harness glittering
in the sun. Quickly enough appeared
the procession from the house. Mrs. Bright-man,
upright and impassive, walking with
stately step ; Hatch, a shawl or two upon
her arm, holding an umbrella over her mistress
to shade her from the sun ; Perry in the
background, carrying the basket of grapes.
Perry would attend his mistress in her drive,
as usual, but not Hatch.

The servants were placing the shawls and
the grapes in the carriage, and Mrs. Bright-man,
who hated anything to be done after
she had taken her seat, was waiting to enter
it, when Mr. Close, the surgeon, came
bustling \x\).

Going for a drive this fine day !" he
exclaimed, as he shook hands with Mrs.
Brightman. " I'm glad of that. I had
been thinking that perhaps you were not
well."

'' Why should you think so ?" asked she.

' Well, Perry was round at my place this
morning, and left a message that he wanted
to see me. I "

Mr. Close suppressed the remainder of
his speech as his gaze suddenly fell on Perry's
startled face. The man had turned from the
carriage, and was looking at him in helpless,
beseeching terror. A faithful retainer was
Perry, an honest butler ; but at a pinch his
brains were no better than what Hatch had
compared them with  those of a turkey.

Mrs. Brightman, her countenance taking
its very haughtiest expression, gazed first
at the doctor, then at Perry, as if demanding
what this might mean ; possibly, poor lady,
she had a suspicion of it. But Hatch, ready
Hatch, was equal to the occasion : she never
lost her presence of mind.

I told Perry he might just as well have
asked young Mr. Dunn for 'em, when he
came back without the drops," said she,
facing the surgeon and speaking carelessly.
Your not being in didn't matter. It was
some cough-drops I sent him for ; the same
as those you've let us have before, Mr.
Close. Our cook's cough is that bad, she
can't sleep at night, nor let anybody else
sleep that's within earshot of her room."

Well, I came round in a hurry, thinking-some
of you might be suffering from this
complaint that's going about," said Mr. Close,
taking up the clue in an easy manner.

'' That there spasmodic cholera," assented
Hatch.

Cholera ! It's not cholera. There's
nothing of that sort about," said the surgeon.
But there's a good bit of influenza ; I have
half a dozen patients suffering from it. A
spell of bright weather such as this, though,
will soon drive it away. And I'll send you
some of the drops when I get back. Hatch."

Mrs. Briof-htman advanced to the carriage :

the surgeon was at hand to assist her in.
Perry stood on the other side his mistress.
Hatch had retreated to the gate and was
looking on.

Suddenly a yell, as of something unearthly,
startled their ears. A fierce-looking
bull, frightened probably by the passers-by
on the road, and the prods given to it by the
formidable stick of its driver, had dashed
behind the carriage on to the foot-path, and
set up that terrible roar. Mr. Close looked
round, Perry did the same ; whilst Mrs.
Brightman, who was in the very act of getting
into her carriage, and whose nerves were
more sensitive than theirs, turned sharply
round also and screamed.

Again Hatch came to the rescue. She
had closed the umbrella and lodged it against
the pillar of the gate, for here they were
under the shade of trees. Seizing the umbrella
now, she opened it with a great dash
and noise, and rushed towards the bull,
pointing it menacingly. The animal, no
doubt more startled than they were, tore

away and gained the highroad again. Then
everyone had leisure to see that Mrs. Bright-man
was lying on the ground partly under
the carriage.

She must have fallen in turning round,
partly from fright, partly from the moving
of the carriage. The horses had also been
somewhat startled by the bull's noise, and
one of them began to prance. The coachman
had his horses well in hand, and soon
quieted them ; but he had not been able to
prevent the movement, which had no doubt
chiefly caused his mistress to fall.

They quickly drew her from under the
carriage and attempted to raise her ; but
she cried out with such tones of agony that
the surgeon feared she was seriously injured.
As soon as possible she was conveyed indoors
on a mattress. Another surgeon joined Mr.
Close, and it was found that her leg was
broken near the ankle.

When it had been set and the commotion
was subsiding. Perry was despatched to
Essex Street with the carriage and the

VOL. III. 50

bad news  the carriage to bring back
Annabel.

' What was it you really came to my
surgery for, Perry ?" Mr. Close took an
opportunity of asking him before he started.

It was about my mistress, sir," answered
the man. " Hatch felt quite sure, by signs
and tokens, that Mrs. Brightman was going
to  to  be ill again. She sent me to tell
you, sir, and to ask if you couldn't give her
something to stop it."

Ah, I thought as much. But when I
saw you all out there, your mistress looking
well and about to take a drive, T concluded
I had been mistaken," said the surgeon.

I had run upstairs during the afternoon
to ask a question of Annabel, and was
standing beside her at the drawing-room
window, where she sat at work, when a
carriage came swiftly down the street, and
stopped at the door.

Why, it is mamma's !" exclaimed Annabel,
looking out.

But I don't see her in it," I rejoined.

* Oh, she must be in it, Charles. Perry
is on the box."

Perry was getting down, but was not
quite so quick in his movements as a shm
young footman would be. He rang the
door-bell, and I was fetched down to him.
In two minutes afterwards I had disclosed
the news to my wife, and brought Perry
upstairs that she might herself question
him. The tears were coursing down her
cheeks.

' Don't take on. Miss Annabel," said the
man, feeling quite too much lost in the bad
tidings to remember Annabel's new title.
There's not the least bit of danger, ma'am ;
Mr. Close bade me say it ; all is sure to goon
well."

Did you bring the carriage for me,
Perry ?"

Yes, ma am, I did. And it was my
mistress herself thought of it. When Mr.
Close, or Hatch  one of 'em it was, I don't
know which  told her they were going to

502

send me for you, she said, ' Let Perry take
the carriage Oh, ma'am, indeed she is
fully as well as she could be ; it was only at
first that she seemed faintish like."

Annabel went back in the carriage at
once. I promised to follow her as early in
the evening as I could get away. Relying
upon the butler's assurance that Mrs. Bright-man
was not in the slightest danger ; that,
on the contrary, it would be an illness of
weeks, if not of months, there was no necessity
for accompanying Annabel at an inconvenient
moment.

* It is, in one sense, the luckiest thing
that could have happened to her," Mr. Close
remarked to me that evening when we were
conversing together.

*' Lucky ! How do you mean ?"

Well, she must be under our control
now," he answered in significant tones, '' and
we were fearing, only to-day, that she was
on the point of breaking out again. A long
spell of enforced abstinence, such as this,
may effect wonders."

Of course, looking at it in that licht, the
accident might be called fortunate. ' There's
a silver lining to every cloud."

Annabel took up her abode temporarily
at her mother's : Mrs. Brightman requested
it. I went down there of an evening 
though not every evening  returning to
Essex Street in the morning. Tom's increasing
illness kept me in town occasionally,
for I could not help going to see him,
and he was growing weaker day by day.
The closing features of consumption were
gaining upon him rapidly. To add to our
difficulties, Mr. Policeman Wren, who seemed
to follow Tom's changes of domicile in a very
ominous and remarkable manner, had now
transferred his beat from South work, and
might be seen pacing before Lennard's door
ten times a day.

One morning when I had come up from
Clapham and was seated in my own room
opening letters, Lennard entered. He closed
the door with a quiet, cautious movement,
and waited, without speaking.

Anything particular, Lennard ?"

Yes, sir ; I've brought rather bad news,"
he said. " Captain Heriot is worse."

Worse ? In what way ? But he is not
Captain Heriot, Lennard ; he is Mr. Brown.
Be careful."

We cannot be overheard," he answered,
glancing at the closed door. " He appeared
so exceedingly weak last night that I thought
I would sit up with him for an hour or two,
and then lie down on his sofa for the rest of
the night. About five o'clock this morning
he had a violent fit of coughing and broke a
blood-vessel."

What did you do ?"

I know a little of the treatment necessary
in such cases, and we got the doctor to
him as soon as possible. Mr. Purfleet does
not give the slightest hope now. In fact,
he thinks that a very few days more will
bring the ending."

I sat back in my chair. Poor Tom !
Poor Tom !

'It is the best for him, Mr. Charles,"

spoke Lennard, with some emotion. 'better,
infinitely, than that of which he has been
running the risk. When a man's life is
marred as he has marred his, heaven must
seem like a haven of refuge to him."

' Has he any idea of his critical state ?"

Yes ; and, I feel sure, is quite reconciled
to it. He remarked this morning how
much he should like to see Blanche : meaning,
I presume. Lady Level."

Ah, but there are difficulties in the way,
Lennard. I will come to him myself, but
not until evening. There's no immediate
danger, you tell me, and I do not care to be
seen entering your house during the day
while he is in it. The big policeman might
be on the watch, and ask me what I wanted
there."

Lennard left the room and I returned to
my letters. The next I took up was a note
from Blanche. Lord Level was not yet back
from Marshdale, she told me in it ; he kept
writing miserable scraps of notes in which
he put her off with excuses from day to day.

always assuring her he hoped to be up on
the morrow. But she could see she was
being played with ; and the patience which,
in obedience to me and Major Carlenn, she
had been exercising, was very nearly exhausted.
She wrote this, she concluded by
saying, to warn me that it was so.

Truth to say, I did wonder what was
keeping Level at Marshdale. He had been
there more than a week now.

LAST Days.

OM HERIOT lay on his sofa in
Jwj  his bedroom, the firelight 
inof on his faded face. This was
Monday, the third day since the attack
spoken of by Lennard, and there had not
been any return of it. His voice was stronger
this evening ; he seemed better altogether,
and was jesting, as he loved to do. Leah
had been to see him during the day, and he
was recounting one or two of their passages-alarms,
with much glee.

Charley, old fellow, you look as solemn
as a judge."

Most likely I did. I sat on the other

side the hearth rug, gazing as I listened to
him ; and I thought I saw in his face the
grayness that frequently precedes death.

Did you know that that giant of the
force, Wren, had his eye upon me, Charley ?"

No ! Why do you say so ?"

*well, I think he has  some suspicion,
at any rate. He parades before the house
like a walking apparition. I look at him
from behind the curtains in the other room.
He paraded in like manner, you know, before
that house in Southwark and the other one
in Lambeth."

It may be only a coincidence, Tom.
The police are moved about a good deal
from beat to beat, I fancy."

Perhaps so," assented Tom carelessly.
If he came in and took me, I don't think
he could do much with me now. He accosted
Purfleet to-day."

* Accosted Purfleet!"

Tom nodded. " After his morning visit
to me, he went dashing out of the street-door
in his usual quick way, and dashed

against Wren. One might think a regiment
of soldiers were always waiting to have their
legs and arms cut off, and that Purfleet had
to do it, by the way he rushes about," concluded
Tom.

Well r

' In a hurry this morning, doctor,' says
old Wren, who is uncommonly fond of hearing
himself talk. ' And who is it that's ill
at Mr. Lennard's ?' ' I generally am in a
hurry,' says Purfleet, * and so would you be
if you had as many sick people on your
hands. At Lennard's ? Why, that poor
sufferings daughter of his has had another
attack, and I don't know whether I shall
save her.' And, with that, Purfleet got
away. He related this to me when he came
in at tea-time."

A thought struck me. " But, Tom, does
Purfleet know that you are in concealment
here ? Or why should he have put his
visits to you upon Maria Lennard ?"

Why, how could he be off knowing it ?
Lennard asked him at first, as a matter of

precaution, not to speak of me in the neighbourhood.
Mr. Brown was rather under a
cloud just now, he said. I wouldn't mind
betting a silver sixpence, Charley, that he
knows I am Tom Heriot."

I wondered whether Tom was joking.

Likely enough," went on Tom. '' He
knows that you come to see me, and that
you are Mr. Strange, of Essex Street. And
he has heard, I'll lay, that Mr. Strange had
a wicked sort of half-brother, one Captain
Heriot, who fell into the fetters of the law
and escaped them, and  and may be the
very Mr. Brown who's lying ill here. Pur-fleet
can put two and two together as cleverly
as other people, Charles."

If so, it is frightfully hazardous "

Not at all," interrupted Tom with
equanimity. "He'd no more betray me,
Charley, than he'd betray himself Doctors
don't divulge the secrets of their patients ;
they keep them. It is a point of honour in
the medical code : as well as of self-interest.
What family would call in a man who was

known to run about saying the Smiths next
door had veal for dinner to-day, and they
ought to have had mutton ? If no more
harm reaches me than any brought about by
Purfleet, I am safe enough."

It might be as he said. And I saw that
he would be incautious to the end.

At that moment Mrs. Lennard came in
with something in a breakfast-curd. ' You
are a good lady," said Tom gratefully.  See
how they feed me up, Charley !"

But for the hollow tones, the hectic flush
and the brilliant eyes, it might almost have
been thought he was getting better. The
cough had nearly left him, and the weakness
was not more apparent than it had been fora
week past. But that faint, deep, far-away
sounding voice, which had now come on,
told the truth. The close was near at
hand.

After Mrs. Lennard had left the room
with the empty cup, Tom lay back on the
sofa, put his head on the pillow, and in a
minute or two seemed to be asleep. Presently

I moved gently across the hearth-rug
to fold the warm, light quilt upon his
knees. He opened his eyes.

You need not creep, Charley. I am
not asleep. I had a regular good sleep in
the afternoon, and don't feel inclined for it
now. I was thinking about the funeral."

The funeral !" I echoed, taken back.
Whose funeral ?"

'' Mine. They won't care to lay me by
my mother, will they ?  I mean my own
mother. The world might put its inquisitive
word in, and say that must be Tom
Heriot, the felon. Neither you nor Level
would like that, nor old Carlenn either."

I made no answer, uncertain what to
say.

' Yet I should like to lie by her," he went
on. ' There was a large vault made, when
she died, to hold the three of us  herself,
my father and me. They are in it ; I should
like to be placed with them."

Time enough to think of that, Tom,
when  when  the time comes," I stammered.

LAST DAYS. 191

The time's not far off now, Charley."
Two nights ago, when I was here, you
assured me you were getting better."

Well, I thought I might be ; there are
such ups and downs in a man's state. He
will appear sick unto death to-day, and tomorrow
be driving down to a whitebait
dinner at Greenwich. I've changed my
opinion, Charley ; I've had my warning."

' Had your warning 1 What does that
mean ?

I should like to see Blanche," he
whispered. " Dear little Blanche ! How
I used to tease her in our young days, and
Leah would box my ears for it ; and I teased
you also, Charley. Could you not bring her
here, if Level would let her come ?"

'' Tom, I hardly know. For one thing,
she has not heard anything of the past
trouble, as you are aware. She thinks you
are in India with the regiment, and calls
you a very undutiful brother for not writing
to her. I suppose it might be managed."

Dear little Blanche !" he repeated.

' Yes, I teased her  and loved her all the
time. Just one visit, Charley. It will bethe
last until we meet upon the eternal
shores. Try and contrive it."

I sat thinking how it might be done  the
revelation to Blanche, bringing her to the
house, and obtaining the consent of Lord
Level ; for I should not care to stir in it
without his consent. Tom appeared to bethinking
also, and a silence ensued. It was
he who broke it.

' Charles !"

*' Yes ?"

Do you ever recall events that passed in
our old life at White Littleham Rectory ?
do any of them lie in your memory ?"

I think all of them lie in it," I answered.
'' My memory is, you know, a remarkably
good one."

'' Ay," said Tom. And then he paused
again. " Do you recollect that especial
incident when your father told us of his
dream ?" he continued presently. '' I picture
the scene now ; it has been present to my

mind all day. A frosty winter morning,
icicles on the trees and frosty devices on the
window-panes. You and I and yom father
seated round the breakfast-table ; Leah
pouring out the coffee and cutting bread
and butter for us. He appeared to be in
deep thought, and when I remarked upon it,
and you asked him what he was thinking
of, he said his dream. D'you mind it,
lad ?"

I do. The thing made an impression
on me. The scene and what passed at it
are as plain to me now as though it had
happened yesterday. After saying he was
thinking of his dream, he added, in a dubious
tone, * If it twas a dream.' Mr. Penthorn
came in whilst he was telling it.

' He was fast asleep ; had gone to bed in
the best of health, probably concocting
matter for next Sunday's sermon," resumed
Tom, recalling the facts. " Suddenly, he
awoke at the sound of a voice. It was his
late wife's voice ; your mother, Charley.
He was wide awake on the instant, and

VOL. III. 51

knew the voice for hers ; she appeared to
be standing at the bedside."

But he did not see her," I put in.

No ; he never said he saw her," replied
Tom Heriot. " But the impression was
upon him that a figure stood there, and that
after speaking it retreated towards the
window. He got up and struck a light and
found the room empty, no trace of anyone's
having been in it. Nevertheless he could
not get rid of the belief, though not a superstitious
man, that it was his wife who came
to him."

In the spirit."

In the spirit, of course. He knew her
voice perfectly, he said. Mr. Penthorn
rather ridiculed the matter ; saying it was
nothing but a vivid dream. I don't think
it made much impression ujon your father,
except that it puzzled him."

I don't think it did," I assented, my
thoughts all in the past. " As you observe,
Tom, he was not superstitious ; he had no
particular belief in the supernatural."

No ; it faded from all our minds with
the day  Leah's perhaps excepted. But
what was the result ? On the fourth night
afterwards he died. The dream occurred on
the Friday morning a little before three
o'clock ; your father looked at his watch
when he got out of bed and saw that it wanted
a quarter to three. On Tuesday morning
at a quarter to three he died in his study,
into which he had been carried after his
accident."

All true. The circumstances, to me, were
painful even now.

Well, what do you make of it, Charles ?"

' Nothing. But I don't quite understand
your question."

Do you think his wife really came to
him ?  That she was permitted to come
back to earth to warn him of his approaching
death ?"

I have always believed that. I can
hardly see how anyone could doubt it."

Well, Charley, I did. I was a graceless,
light-headed young wight, you know, and

512

serious things made no impression on me.
If I thought about it at all, it was to put it
down to fancy ; or a dream, as Mr. Penthorn
said ; and I don't believe I've ever had the
thing in my mind from that time to this."

* And why should it come back to you
now ?" I asked.

* Because," answered Tom, " I think I
have had a similar warning."

He spoke very calmly. I looked at him.
He was sitting upright on the sofa now, his
feet stretched out on a warm wool footstool,
the quilt lying across his knees, and
his hands resting upon it.

What can you mean, Tom ?"

'' It was last night," he answered ; " or,
rather, this morning. I was in bed, and
pretty soundly asleep, for me, and I began
to dream. I thought I saw my father come
in through the door, that one opening to
the passage, cross the room and sit down by
the bedside with his face turned to me. I
mean my own father. Colonel Heriot. He
looked just as he used to look ; not a day

older ; his fine figure erect, his bright, wavy
hair brushed off his brow as he always wore
it, his blue eyes smiling and kindly. I was
not in the least surprised to see him ; his
coming in seemed to be quite a matter of
course. ' Well, Thomas,' he began, looking
at me after he had sat down ;  we have
been parted for some time, and I have
much to say to you.' ' Say it now, papa,' I
answered, going back in my dream to the
language of childhood's days.  There's not
time now,' he replied ; ' we must wait a
little yet ; it won't be long, Thomas.' Then
I saw him rise from the chair, re-cross the
room to the door, turn to look at me with a
smile, and go out, leaving the door open. I
awoke in a moment ; at the very moment, I
am certain ; and for some little time I could
not persuade myself that what had passed
was not reality. The chair in which he had
sat stood at the bedside, and the door was
wide open."

But I suppose the chair had been there
all night, and that someone was sitting up

with you ? Whoever it was must have opened
the door."

' The chair had been there all night,"
assented Tom. " But the door had not been
opened by human hands, so far as I can
learn. It was old Faith's turn to sit up
last night  that worthy old soul of a servant
who has clung to the Lennards through all
their misfortunes. Finding that I slept
comfortably. Faith had fallen asleep too in
the big chair in that corner behind you.
She declared that the door had been firmly
shut  and I believe she thought it was I
who had got up and opened it."

It was a dream, Tom."

* Granted. But it was a warning. It
came  nay, who can say it was not he who
came ?  to show me that I shall soon be with
him. We shall have time, and to spare, to
talk then. I have never had so vivid a
dream in my life ; or one that so left behind
it the impression that it had been reality."

' Well "

Look here," he interrupted. '' Your

father said, if you remember, that the visit
paid to him, whether real or imaginary, by
his wife, and the words she spoke, had revived
within him his recollections of her voice,
which had in a slight degree begun to fade.
Well, Charles, I give you my word that I
had partly forgotten my father's appearance ;
I was only a little fellow when he died ; but
his visit to me in my dream last night has
brought it back most vividly. Come, you
wise old lawyer, what do you say to that ?"

I don't know, Tom. Such things are, I
suppose."

*' If I got well and lived to be a hundred
years old, I should never laugh at them
again."

'' Did you tell Leah this when she was
here to-day ?"

 Ay ; and of course she burst out crying.
Take it as it's meant, Master Tom,' said
she, ' and prepare yourself It is your warning.'
Just as she had told your father,
Charles, that that other was his warning.
She was right then ; she is risfht now."

You cannot know it. And you must
not let this trouble you."

'' It does not trouble me," he answered
quickly. " Rather the contrary, for it sets
my mind at rest. I have had little hope of
myself for some time past ; I have had none,
so to say, since that sudden attack a few
nights ago ; nevertheless, I won't say but a
grain of it may have still deluded me now
and again. Rope is the last thing we part
with in this world, you know, lad. But this
dream-visit of my father has shown me the
truth beyond all doubt ; and now I have
only to make my packet, as the French say,
and wait for the signal to start."

We talked together a little longer, but my
time was up. I left him for the night and
apparently in the best of spirits.

Lennard was alone in his parlour when
I got downstairs. I asked him whether
he had heard of this fancy of Tom's about
the dream.

Yes," he answered. ' He told me about
it this evening, when I was sitting with him

after tea ; but he did not seem at all depressed
by it. I don't think it matters much
either way," added Lennard thoughtfully,
for the end cannot be far off now."

He has an idea that Purfleet guesses
who he really is."

But he has no grounds for saying it,"
returned Lennard. " Purfleet heard when
he was first called in that ' Mr. Brown '
wished to be kept en cachette, if I may so
put it ; but that he should guess him to be
Captain Heriot is quite improbable. Because
Captain Heriot is aware of his own
identity, he assumes that other people must
needs be aware of it."

One might trust Purfleet not to betray
him, I fancy, if he does guess it ?"

'that I am sure of," said Lennard warmly.
He is kind and benevolent. Most medical
men are so from their frequent contact with
the dark shades of life, whether of sickness
or of sorrow. As to Purfleet, he is too hard-worked,
poor man, to have much leisure for
speculating upon the affairs of other people."

Wren is still walking about here."
Yes ; but I think he has been put upon
this beat in the ordinary way of things,
not that he is looking after anyone in particular.
Mr. Strange, if he had any suspicion
of Captain Heriot in Lambeth, he
would have taken him ; he would have taken
him again when in South work ; and he would,
ere this, have taken him here. Wren appears
to be one of those gossiping men who
must talk to everybody ; and I believe that
is all the mystery."

Wishing Lennard good - night, I went
home to Essex Street, and sat down to write
to Lord Level. He would not receive the
letter at Marshdale until the following afternoon,
but it would be in time for him to
answer me by the evening post.

LAST WORDS.

HE next day, Tuesday, I was very
busy, hurrying forward to get
down to ClajDliam in time for
dinner in the evening. Lennard's report in
the morning had been that Captain Heriot
was no worse, and that Mr. Purfleet, who
had paid him an early visit, said there might
be no change for a week or more.

In the afternoon I received a brief note
from Mr. Serjeant StilKngfar, asking me to
be in Russell Square the following morning
by eight o'clock : he wished to see me very
particularly.

Knowing that when he named any special

hour he meant it, and that he expected
everyone who had dealings with him to be
as punctual as himself, I came up to town
on the Wednesday morning, and was at his
house a few minutes before eight o'clock.
The Serjeant was just sitting down to
breakfast.

Will you take some, Charles ?" he
asked.

'' No, thank you, uncle. I have just
come ap from Clapham, and breakfasted
before starting."

' How is Mrs. Brightman going on ?"

'' Quite well. It will be a long job, the
doctors say, from something unusual connected
with the fracture, but nothing
dangerous."

'' Sit down, Charles," he said. " And tell
me at once. Is Captain Heriot," lowering his
voice, " in a state to be got away ?"

The words did not surprise me. The
whole night it had been in my mind that
the Serjeant's mandate concerned Tom
Heriot.

' No ; it would be impossible," I answered.
'' He has to be moved gently, from bed to
sofa, and can only walk, if he attempts it at
all, by being helped on both sides. Three
or four days ago, a vessel on the lungs
broke ; any undue exertion would at once
be fatal."

Then, do I understand you that he is
actually dying ?"

' Undoubtedly he is, sir. I was with
him on Monday night, and saw in his face
the gray hue which is the precursor of death.
I am sure I was not mistaken "

 That peculiar hue can never be mistaken
by those who have learnt from sad experience,"
he interrupted dreamily.

He may linger on a few days, even a
week or so, I believe the doctor thinks, but
death is certainly on its road ; and he must
die where he is, Uncle Stillingfar. He cannot
be again moved."

The Serjeant sat silent for a few moments.
"It is very unfortunate, Charles," he resumed.
" Could he have been got away it

would be better for him, better for you all.
Though, in truth, it is not I who ought to
suggest it, as you well know ; but sometimes
one's private and public duties oppose each
other."

Have you heard anything, uncle ?"

I have heard from a sure source that
the authorities know that Captain Heriot is
in London. They know it positively : but not,
I think, where he is concealed. The search
for him will now commence in earnest."

It is, indeed, unfortunate. I have been
housing he would be left to die in peace.
One thing is certain : if the police find him
they can only let him remain where he is.
They cannot remove him."

Then nothing can be done : things must
take their course," sighed the Serjeant.
You must take precautions yourself,
Charles. Most probably the movements
of those connected with him will now be
watched, in the hope that they may afford
a clue to his hiding-place."

'' I cannot abandon him, Uncle Stillingfar.

I must see him to the end. We have been
as brothers, you knoY. He wants to see
Blanche, and I have written about it to
Lord Level."

'' Well, well, I cannot advise ; I wish I
could," he replied. " But I thought it my
duty to let you know this."

A few days will, in any case, see the
ending," I whispered as I bade him goodbye.
" Thank you for all your sympathy,
uncle."

My boy, there is One above," raising
his hand reverently, " who has more-pity
for us than we have for one another. He
can keep him in peace yet. Don't forget
that, Charles."

To my office, then, and the morning letters.
Amidst them lay [Lord Level's answer.
Some of its contents surprised me,

Marshdale House,

Tuesday Evening.

Dear Charles,

If you like to undertake the
arrangement of the visit you propose, do

SO. I have no objection. For some little
time now I have thought that it might
be better that my wife should know the
truth. You see she is, and has been, liable
to hear it at any moment through some
untoward revelation, for which she would
not be prepared ; and the care I have taken
to avoid this has not only been sometimes
inconvenient to myself, but misconstrued by
Blanche. When we were moving about
after our marriage, I kept her in unfrequented
places, as far as I could, to spare
her the chance of this ; men's lips were full
of it just then, as you know. Blanche
resented that bitterly, putting it all down to
some curious purposes of my own. Let her
hear the truth now. I am not on the spot
to impart it to her myself, and shall be glad
if you will do so. Afterwards you can take
her to see the invalid. I am sorry for what
you say of his state. Tell him so : and that
he has my sympathy and best wishes.

'' Blanche has been favouring me lately
with some letters Written in anything but a

complimentary strain. One that I received
this morning coolly informs me that she is
about to * Take immediate stejs to obtain a
formal separation, if not a divorce.' I am
not able to travel to London and settle
things with her, and have written to her to
tell her to come here to me. The fact is, I
am ill. Strange to say, the same sort of
low fever which attacked me when I was at
Marshdale last autumn has returned upon
me now. It is not as bad as it was then,
but I am confined to bed. Spare the time
to bring Blanche down, there's a good fellow.
I have told her that you will do so. Come
on Thursday if convenient to you, and remain
the night. She shall hear what I have
to say to her ; after that, she can talk of a
separation if she likes. You shall hear it also.
'' Ever truly yours,

Level."

Whilst deliberating ujjon the contents of
this letter, and how I could best carry out
its requests, Lennard came in, as usual on

VOL. in. 52

his arrival for the day, to give me his report
of Tom Heriot. There was not any apparent
change in him, he said, either for the better
or the worse. I informed Lennard of what
I had just heard from the Serjeant.

Then I despatched a clerk to Gloucester
Place with a note for Blanche, telling her I
should be with her early in the evening, and
that she must not fail to be at home, as my
business was important.

Twilight was falling when I arrived.
Blanche sat at one of the windows in the
drawing-room, looking listlessly into the
street in the fading light. Old Mrs. Guy,
who was staying with her, was lying on the
dining-room sofa, Blanche said, having retired
to it and fallen asleep after dinner.

How lovely Blanche looked ; but how
cross ! She wore a pale blue silk, her
favourite colour, with a gold necklace and
open bracelets, from which drooped a heart
set with sapphires and diamonds ; and her
fair, silken hair looked as if she had been
impatiently pushing it about.

''I know what you have come for, Charles,"
she said in fretful tones, as I sat down near
her. " Lord Level prepared me in a letter
I received from him this morning."

Indeed !" I answered lightly. " What
did the preparation consist of?"

I wrote to him," said Blanche. " I
have written to him more than once, telling
him I am about to get a separation. In
answer, my lord commands me down to
Marshdale "  very resentful! v  " and says
you are to take me down."

All quite right, Blanche ; quite true, sofar.
But "

But I don't know that I shall go. I
think I shall not go."

A wife should obey her husband's commands."


'' I do not intend to be his wife any longer.
And you cannot wish me to be, Charles ;
you ought not to wish it. Lord Level's
conduct is simply shameful. What right
has he to stay at Marshdale  amusing himself
down there ?"

52  2

'' I fancy he cannot help staying there at
present. Has he told you he is ill ?"

She glanced quickly round at me.

Has he told you that he is so ?"

' Yes, Blanche ; he has. He is too ill to
travel."

She paused for a moment, and then tossed
back her pretty hair with a scornful hand.

' And you believed him ! Anything for
an excuse. He is no more ill than J am,
Charles ; rely upon that."

' But I am certain "

' Don't go on," she interrupted, tapping
her dainty black satin slipper on the carpet ;
a petulant movement to which Blanche was
given, even as a child. '' If you have come
for the purpose of whitening my husband tome,
as papa is always doing, I will not listen
to you."

You will not listen to any sort of reasoning
whatever. I see that, my dear."

Reasoning, indeed !" she retorted. " Say
sophistry."

Listen for an instant, Blanche ; consider

this one little item : I believe Lord Level to
be ill, confined to his bed with low fever, ashe
tells me ; you refuse to believe it ; you
say he is well. Now, considering that he
expects us both to be at Marshdale tomorrow,
can you not perceive how entirely, ridiculous
void of purpose it would be for him to say
he is seriously ill if he is not so ?"

' I don't care," said my young lady.  He
is deeper than any fox."

'' Blanche, my opinion is, and you are
aware of it, that you misjudge your husband.
Upon one or two points I knoiv you do.
But I did not come here to discuss these
unpleasant topics  you are in error there,
you see. I came upon a widely different
matter : to disclose something to you that
will very greatly distress you, and I am
grieved to be obliged to do it."

The words changed her mood. She looked
half frightened.

Oh !" she burst forth, before I had time
to say another word. 'ris it my husband ?
You say he is ill ! He is not dead ?"

My dear, be calm. It is not about your
husband at all. It is about some one else,
though, who is very ill  Tom Heriot."

Grieved she no doubt was ; but the relief
that crept into her face, tone and attitude
proved that the one man was little to
her compared with the other, and that she
loved her husband yet with an impassioned
love.

By degrees, softening the facts as much
as possible, I told the tale. Of Tom's apprehension
about the time of her marriage ; his
trial which followed close upon it ; his conviction,
and departure for a penal settlement ;
his escape ; his return to England ; his concealments
to evade detection ; his illness ;
and his present state. Blanche shivered and
cried as she listened, and finally fell ujon
her knees, and buried her face in the cushions
of the chair.

And is there no hope for him, Charles ?"
she said, looking up after a while.

My dear, there is no hope. And, under
the circumstances, it is happier for him to

die than to continue to live. But he would
like to see you, Blanche."

Poor Tom ! Poor Tom ! Can we goto
him now  this evening ?"

'' Yes ; it is what I came to propose. It
is the best time. He "

'' Shall I order the carriage ?"

The interruption made me laugh. My
Lord Level's state carriage and powdered
servants at that poor fugitive's door !

My dear, we must go in the quietest
manner. We will take a cab as we walk
along, and get out of it before turning into
the street where he is lying. Change this
blue silk for one of the plainest dresses that
you have, and wear a close bonnet and a
veil."

Oh, of course ; I see. Charles, I am
too thoughtless."

Wait an instant," I said, arresting her
as she was crossing the room. '' I must
return for a moment to our controversy
touching your husband. You complained
bitterly of him last year for secluding you in

dull, remote parts of the Continent, and
especially for keeping you away from
England. You took up the notion, and
proclaimed it to those who would listen to
you, that it was to serve his own purposes.
Do you remember this ?"

' Well ?" said Blanche timidly, her colour
coming' and Qoingf as she stood with her
hands on the table. " He did keep me away ;
he did seclude me."

' It was done out of love for you, Blanche.
Whilst your heart felt nothing but reproach
for him, his was filled with care and consideration
for you ; where to keep you, how
to guard you from hearing of the disgrace
and trouble that had overtaken your brother.
We knew  I and Mr. Brightman  Lord
Level's motive ; and Major Carlenn knew. I
believe Level would have given years of his
life to save you from the knowledge always
and secure you peace. Now, Blanche, my
dear, as you perceive that, at least in that
one respect, you misjudged him then, do sou
not think you may be misjudging him still ?"

She burst into tears. " No, I don't think
so," she said. ' I wish I could think so.
You know that he maintains some dreadful
secret at Marshdale ; and that  that 
wicked Italians are often staying there 
singers perhaps ; I shouldn't wonder ; or
ballet-dancers  anyway, people who can have
no right and no business to be there. You
know that one of them stabbed him  Oh
yes, she did, and it was a woman with long
hair."

' I do not know anything of the kind."
' Charles, you look at me reproachfully,
as if the blame lay with me instead of him.
Can't you see what a misery it all is for me,
and that it is wearing my life away ?" she
cried passionately, the tears falling from her
eyes. " I would rather die than separate
from him, if I were not forced to it by
the goings on at that wretched Marshdale.
What will life be worth to me, parted from
him ? I look forward to it with a sick dread.
Charles, I do indeed ; and now, when I
know  what  is perhaps  coming "

Blanche suddenly crossed her arms upon
the table, hid her face upon them, and sobbed
bitterly.

 What is perhaps coming ?"

I'm afraid it is, Charles."

'' But what is ?"

An heir, perhaps."

It was some moments before I took in the
sense of the words. Then I laughed.

'' Oh well, Blanche ! Of course you ought
to talk of separation with that in prospect !
Go and put your things on, you silly child :
the evening is wearing away."

And she left the room.

Side by side on the sofa, Blanche's fair
head pillowed upon his breast, his arm
thrown round her. She had taken off her
bonnet and mantle, and was crying quietly.

'' Be calm, my dear sister. It is all for
the best."

Tom, Tom, how came you to do it ?"

' I didn't do it, my dear one. That's
where they were mistaken. I should be no

more capable of doing such a thing than you
are.

Then why did they condemn you  and
say you were guilty ?"

They knew no better. The guilty man
escaped, and I suffered."

But why did you not tell the truth ?
Why did you not accuse him to the
judge ?"

I told the judge I was innocent ; but
that is what most prisoners say, and it made
no impression on him," replied Tom. " For
the rest, I did not understand the affair as
well as I did after the trial. All had been so
hurried ; there was no time for anything.
Yes, Blanche, you may at least take this
solitary bit of consolation to your heart 
that I was not guilty."

And that other man, who was ?" she
asked eagerly, lifting her face. '' Where is
he ?"

Flourishing," said Tom. " Driving about
the world four-in-hand, no doubt, and taking
someone else in as he took me."

Blanche turned to me, looking haughty
enough.

' Charles, cannot anything be done to expose
the man ?" she cried. Tom spoke
again before I could answer.

It will not matter to me then, one way
or the other. But, Charley, I do sometimes
wish, as I lie thinking, that the truth might
be made known and my memory cleared.
I was reckless and foolish enough, heaven
knows, but I never did that for which I was
tried and sentenced."

Now, since we had been convinced of Tom
Heriot's innocence, the question whether it
would be possible to clear him before the
world had often been in my mind. Lake
and I had discussed it more than once. It
would be difficult, no doubt, but it was just
possible that time might place some advantage
in our hands and open up a way to us.
I mentioned this now.

Ay, difficult enough, I dare say," commented
Tom. " With a hundred barriers in
the way  eh, Charley ?"

*' The chief difficulty would lie, I believe, in
the fact you acknowledged just now, Tom 
your own folly. People argue  they argued
at the time  that a young man so reckless
as you were would not stick at a trifle."

Just so," replied Tom with equanimity.
I ought to have pulled up before, and  I
did not. Well ; you know my innocence,
and now Blanche knows it, and Level knows
it, and old Carlenn knows it ; you are about
all that are near to me ; and the public must
be left to chance. There's one good man,
though, I should like to know it, Charles,
and that's Serjeant Stillingfar."

He knows it already, Tom. Be at ease
on that score."

Does he think, I wonder, that my
memory might ever be cleared ?"

He thinks it would be easier to clear
you than it would be to trace the guilt to its
proper quarter ; but the one, you see, rests
upon the other. There are no proofs, that
we know of, to bring forward of that man's
guilt ; and "

'' He took precious good care there should
be none," interrupted Tom. '' Let Anstey
alone for protecting himself."

Just so. But  I was going to say 
the Serjeant thinks you have one chance in
your favour. It is this : The man, Anstey,
being what he is, will probably fall into some
worse crime which cannot be hidden or hushed
up. When conviction overtakes him, he
may be induced to confess that it was he,
and not Captain Heriot, who bore the lion's
share in that past exploit for which you
suffered. Rely upon this, Tom  should any
such chance of clearing your memory present
itself, it will not be neglected. I shall be on
the watch always."

There was silence for a time. Tom was
leaning back, pale and exhausted, his breath
was short, his face gray, wan and wasted.

Has Leah been to see you ?" Blanche
asked him.

Yes, twice ; and she considers herself
very hardly dealt by that she may not come
here to nurse me," he replied.

' Could she not be here ?"

I shook ray head. " It would not be safe,
Blanche. It would be running another risk.
You see, trouble would fall upon others as
well as Tom, were he discovered now : upon
me, and more especially upon Lennard."

* They would be brought to trial for concealing
me, just as I was brought to trial fora
different crime," said Tom lightly. " Our
English laws are comprehensive, I assure
you, Blanche. Poor Leah says it is cruel
not to let her see the end. I asked her
what good she'd derive from it."

Blanche gave a sobbing sigh. " How can
you talk so lightly, Tom ?"

' Lightly !" he cried, in apparent astonishment.
'' I don't myself see very much that's
light in that. When the end is at hand,
Blanche, why ignore it ?"

She turned her face again to him, burying
it upon his arm, in utmost sorrow.

* Don't, Blanche 1" he said, his voice
trembling. " There's nothing to cry for ;
nothing. My darling sister, can't you see

what a life mine has been for months past :
pain of body, distress and apprehension of
mind ! Think what a glorious change it will
be to leave all this for Heaven !"

Are you sure of going there, dear ?" she
whispered. " Have you made your peace ?"

Tom smiled at her. Tears were in his
own eyes.

I think so. Do you remember that
wonderful answer to the petition of the thief
on the cross ? The promise came back to
him at once, on the instant : ' Verily, I say
unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with Me in
Paradise.' He had been as much of a sinner
as I, Blanche."

Blanche was crying softly. Tom held her
to him.

' Imagine," he said, " how the change
must have broken on that poor man. To
pass from the sorrow and suffering of this
life into the realms of Paradise ! There
was no question as to his fitness, you see, or
whether he had been good or bad ; all the
sin of the past was condoned when he took



his humble appeal to his Redeemer : ' Lord,
remember me when Thou comest into Thy
kingdom !' Blanche, my dear, I know that
He will also remember me."

VOL. III.



DOWN AT Marshal.

T was Thursday morning, the day
on which Blanche Level was to
travel to Marshdale. She sat in
her dining-room at Gloucester Place, her
fingers busy over some delicate fancy-work,
her thoughts divided between the sad interview
she had held with Tom Heriot the
previous night, and the forthcoming interview
with her husband ; whilst her attention
was partially given to old Mrs. Guy, who
sat in an easy-chair by the hire, a thick plaid
shawl on her shoulders and her feet on the
fender, recounting the history of an extraordinary
pain which had attacked her in the

night. But as Mrs. Guy rarely passed a
night without experiencing some extraordinary
pain or other, Blanche listened
absently.

It is the heart, my dear ; I am becoming
sure of that," said the old lady. ' Last
year, if you remember, the physician put it
down to spleen ; but when I go to him tomorrow
and tell him of this dreadful oppression,
he will change his opinion."

 Don't you think you keep yourself too
warm ?" said Blanche, who looked so cool
and fresh in her pretty morning dress.
'' That shawl is heavy, and the fire is warm ;
yet it is still quite summer weather."

Ah, child, you young people call it
summer weather all the year round if the
sun only shines. When you get to be my
age, Blanche, you will know what cold
means. I dare say you'll go flying ofl* to
Marshdale this afternoon in that gossamer
dress you have on, or one as thin and
flowing."

No, I shan't," laughed Blanche ; '' it

53  2

would be tumbled and spoilt by the time
I got there. I shall go in that pretty
new gray cashmere, trimmed with silk
brocade."

' That's a lovely dress, child ; too good
to travel in. And you tell me you will be
back tomorrow. I don't think that very
likely, my dear "

But I intend to be," interrupted Blanche.

You will see," nodded the old lady.
** When your husband gets you there, he
will keep you there. Give my love to him,
Blanche, and say I hope he will be in town
before I go back to Jersey. I should like
to see him."

Blanche was not paying particular attention
to this message. Her attention was
attracted by a telegraph boy, who seemed
to be approaching the door. The next
moment there was a loud knock, which
made Mrs. Guy start. Blanche explained
that it was a telegram.

'' Oh, dear," cried the old lady. '' I don't
like telegrams ; they always give me a turn.

Perhaps it's come from Jersey to say my
house is burned down."

The telegram, however, had come from
Marshdale. It was addressed to Lady
Level, and proved to be from her husband.

Do not come to Marshdale to-day. Put
it off until next tveeJi. I am writing to you.
Wait for letter. Let Charles knoiv."

Now my Lady Level, staring at the
message, and beings in chronic resentment
against her husband, all sorts of unorthodox
suspicions rife within her, put the worst
possible construction upon this mandate.

I kneiv how much he would have me at
Marshdale 1" she exclaimed in anger, as she
tossed the telegram on the table. "  Don't
come down till next week ! Wait for letter !'
Yes, and next week there'll come another
message, telling me I am not to go at all, or
that he will be back here. It is a shame 1"

But what is it ?" cried old Mrs. Guy,
who did not understand, and knew nothing

of any misunderstanding between Blanche
and her husband. " Not to go, you say ?
Is his lordship ill ?"

Oh, of course ; very ill, indeed," returned
Blanche, suppressing the scorn she
felt.

Putting the telegram into an envelope,
she addressed it to me, called Sanders, and
bade him take it at once to my office.
He did so. But I had also received one
to the same effect from Lord Level, who, I
suppose, concluded it best to send to me
direct. Telling Sanders I would call on
Lady Level that evening, I thought no
more about the matter, and was glad, rather
than otherwise, that the journey to Marsh-dale
was delayed. This chapter, however,
has to do with Blanche, and not with me.

Now, whether the step that Lady Level
took had its rise in an innocent remark made
by Mrs. Guy, or whether it was the result
of her own indignant feeling, cannot be told.
My dear," said the old lady, " if my husband
were ill, I should ofo to him all the

more." And that was just what Blanche
Level resolved to do.

The previous arrangement had been that
she should drive to my office, to save me
time, pick me up, and so onwards to Victoria
Station, to take the four o'clock train, which
would land us at Marshdale in an hour.

'' My dear, I thought I understood that
you were not going to Marshdale ; that the
telegram stopped you," said Mrs. Guy,
hearing Blanche give orders for the carriage
to be at the door at a quarter past three
to convey her to Victoria, and perceiving
also that she was making preparations fora
journey.

But I intend to go all the same," replied
Blanche. " And look here, dear Mrs. Guy,
Charles has sent me word that he will call
here this evening. When he comes, please
give him this little note. You won't forget
?"

Not I, child. Major Carlenn is always
telling me I am silly ; but I'm not silly
enough to fors-et messao-es."

The barouche waited at the door at the
appointed time, and Lady Level was driven
to Victoria, where she took train for Marsh-dale.
Five o'clock was striking out from
Lower Marshdale Church when she arrived
at Marshdale Station.

Get out here, miss ?" asked the porter,
who saw Lady Level trying to open the
door.

Yes."

'' Any luggage ?"

Only this bag," replied Lady Level.

The man took charge of it, and she
alighted. Traversing the little roadside
station, she looked to where the fly generally
stood ; but no fly was there. The
station-master waited for her ticket.

Is the fly not here ?" she inquired.

Seems not," answered the master indifferently.
But as he spoke he recognised
Lady Level.

I beg your pardon, my lady. The fly
went off with some passengers who alighted
from the last up-train ; it's not back yet."

Will it be long, do you know ?"

Well  I James," he called to the

porter, '' where did the fly go to ?"

Over to Dimsdale," replied the man.

' Then it won't be back for half an hour
yet, my lady," said the station-master to
Lady Level.

' Oh, I can't wait all that time," she
returned, rather impatiently. " I will walk.
Will you be good enough to send my bag
after me ?"

I'll send it directly, my lady."

She was stepping from the little platform
when a thought struck her, and she turned
to ask a question of the station-master.
Is it safe to cross the fields now ? I
remember it was said not to be so when I
was here last."

On account of Farmer Piggot's bull,"
replied he. '' The fields are quite safe now,
my lady ; the bull has been taken away."

Lady Level passed in at the little gate,
which stood a few yards down the road, and
was the entrance to the field-way which led

to Marshdale House. It was a warm evening,
calm and sunny ; not a leaf stirred ; all
nature seemed at rest.

*' What will Archibald say to me ?" she
wondered, her thoughts busy. " He will
fly into a passion, perhaps. I can't help it
if he does. I am determined now to find
out why I am kept away from Marshdale
and why he is for ever coming to it. This
underhand work has been o-oinof on too
long."

At this moment, a whistle behind her,
loud and shrill, caused her to turn. She
was then crossing the first field. In the
distance she espied a boy striding towards
her : and soon recognised him for the surly
boy, Sam Doughty. He carried her bag,
and vouchsafed her a short nod as he came
up.

'' How are you, Sam ?" she asked pleasantly.


' Didn't think about its being you," was
Sam's imperturbable answer, as he walked
on beside her. " When they disturbs me at

my tea and says I must go right off that
there same moment with a passenger's bag
for Marshals House, I took it to be my
lord's at least."

Did they not let you finish your tea ?"
said Lady Level with a smile.

'' Catch 'em' retorted Sam, in a tone of
resentment. " Catch 'em a letting me stop
for a bite or a sup when there's work to do ;
no, not if I was starving for 't. The master,
he's a regular stinger for being down upon a

fellow's work, and t'other's a 1 say,"

broke off Mr. Sam, " did you ever know a
rat ?  one what keeps ferreting his nose into
everything as don't concern him ? Then
you've snowed James Run."

James Runnn is the porter, I suppose ?"
said Lady Level, much amused.

Well, he is, and the biggest sneak as
ever growed. What did he go and do last
week ? We had a lot o' passengers to get
off by the down train to Dover, the people
from the Grange it were, and a sight o'
trunks. I'd been helping to stow the things

in the luo-o-aofe-van, and the footman, as he
was getting into his second-class carriage,
holds out a shilling, ogden handed. I'd got
my fingers upon it, I had, when that there
James Runnn, that rascally porter, clutches
hold of it and says it were meant for him,
not for me. I wish he was gone, I do !"

The bull is gone, I hear," remarked
"Cfady Level.

Oh, he have been 2fone this honos time
from here," replied the boy, shifting the bag
from one shoulder to the other. ' He took
to run at folks regular, he did ; such fun it
were to hear 'em squawk ! One old woman
in a red shawl he took and tossed. Mr.
Hewett up at the House interfered then,
and told Farmer Piosfot the bull must be
moved ; so the farmer put him over yonder
on t'other side his farm into the two-acre
meadow, which haven't got no right o' way
through it. I wish he had tossed that
there James Runnn first and done for him !"
deliberately avowed Sam, again shifting his
burden.

You appear to find that bag heavy,"
remarked Lady Level.

It's not that heavy, so to say," acknowledged
the surly boy ; " it's that I be famishing
for my tea. Oh, that there Runnn's
vicious, he is !  a sending me off when I'd
hardly took a mouthful !"

Well, I could not carry it myself," she
said laughingly.

He might ha' brought it ; he had swallowed
down his own tea, he had. It's not
so much he does  just rushes up to the
doors o' the trains when they comes in, on
the look out for what may be give to him,
making believe he's letting folks in and out
o' the carriages. I see my lord give him a
shilling t'other day ; that I did."

' When my lord arrived here, do you

03)

mean f

No, 't wasn't that day, 't were another.
My lord comes on to the station asking
about a parcel he were expecting of Mr.
Noakes, he were gone to his dinner, and
that there Runnn answered my lord that he

Lady Level laughed. It was impossible
to help it. Sam's tone was so intensely
wrathful.

Do you see much of Lord Level ?" she
asked.

I've not see'd him about for some days.
It's said he's ill."

'' What is the matter with him ?"

' Don't know," said Sam. " It were Dr.
Hill's young man, Mitcham, I heard say it.
Mother sent me last night to Dr. Hill's
for her physic, and Mr. Mitcham he said he
had not been told naught about her physic,
but he'd ask the doctor when he came back
from attending upon my Lord Level."

Is your mother ill ?" inquired Sam's
listener.

She be that bad, she be, as to be more
fit to be a-bed nor up," replied the boy : and
his voice really took a softer tone as he

spoke of his mother. ' It were twins this
last time, you see, and there's such a lot todo
for 'em all, mother can't spare a minute
in the day to lie by : and father's wages
don't go so fur as they did when there was
less mouths at home."

How many brothers and sisters have
you f

Five," said Sam, '' not counting the
twins, which makes seven. I be the eldest,
and I makes eight. And, if ever I does
get a shilling or a sixpence give me, I
takes it right home to mother. I wish
them there two twins had kejDt away,"
continued Sam spitefully ; '' mother had her
hands full without them. Squalling things
they both be."

Thus, listening to the boy's confidences,
Lady Level came to the little green gate
which opened to the side of the garden at
Marshdale House. Sam carried the bag to
the front door. No one was to be seen.
All things, indoors and out, seemed intensely
quiet.

You can put it down here, Sam," said
Lady Level, producing half-a-crown. " Will
you give this to your mother if I give it to
you ?

'' I always gives her everything as is
give to me," returned Sam resentfully. ' I
felled ye so."

Slipping it into his pocket, the boy set
off again across the fields. Lady Level rang
the bell gently. Somehow she was not feeling
so well satisfied with herself for having
come as she felt when she started. Deborah
opened the door.

 Oh, my lady !" she exclaimed in surprise,
but speaking in a whisper.

My bag is outside," said Lady Level,
walking forward to the first sitting-room,
the door of which stood open. Mrs. Edwards
met her.

Dear, dear !" exclaimed the old lady,
lifting: her hands. '' Then Snow never sent
those messages off properly after all ! My
lady, I am sorry you should have come."

' I thought I was expected, Mrs. Edwards,

and Mr. Strange with me," returned Blanche
coldly.

True, my lady, so you were ; but a
telegram was sent off this morning to stop
you. Two telegrams went, one to your
ladyship and one to Mr. Strange. It was I
gave the order from my lord to Snow, and I
thought I might as well send one also to
Mr. Strange, though his lordship said nothing
about it."

But why was I stopped ?" questioned
Blanche.

On account of Qiy lord's increased illness,"
replied Mrs. Edwards. " He grew
much worse in the night ; and when Mr.
Hill saw how it was with him this morning,
he said your ladyship's visit must be put off.
Mr. Hill is with him now."

Of what nature is his illness ?"

My lady, he has not been very well
since he came down. When he oft here
we remarked that he seemed low-spirited.
In a few days he began to be feverish, and
asked me to get him some lemonade made.

VOL. III. 5-4:

Quarts of it he drank : cook protested
there'd be a failure of lemons in the village.
It is last year's fever back again,' said his
lordship to me, speaking in jest. But,
strange to say, he might as well have
spoken in earnest, for it turns out to be the
same sort of fever precisely."

Is he very ill ?"

'' He is very ill indeed to-day," answered
Mrs. Edwards. '' Until this morning it
was thought to be a light attack, no danger
attending it, nor any symptom of delirium.
But that has all changed, and this afternoon
he is slightly delirious."

'* Is there  danger ?" cried Blanche.

'' Mr. Hill says not, my lady. Not yet,
at all events. But  here he is," broke off
Mrs. Edwards, as the doctor's step was
heard. " He will be able to explain more of
the illness to your ladyship than I can."

She left the room as Mr. Hill entered it.
The same cheerful, hearty man that Blanche
had known last year, with a fine brow and
benevolent countenance. Blanche shook

hands with him, and he sat down near
her.

So you did not get the telegram," he
began, after greeting her.

I did get it," answered Blanche, feeling
rather ashamed to be obliged to confess it.
'' But I  I was ready, and I thought I would
come all the same."

'at is a jDity," said Mr. Hill. 'you
must not let your husband see you. Indeed,
the best thing you can do weill be to go back
again."

But why ?" asked Blanche, turning
obstinate. " What have I done to him that
he may not see me ?"

You don't understand, child," said the
surgeon, speaking in his fatherly way. " His
lordship is in a critical state, the disease
having manifested itself with alarming rapidity.
If he can be kept perfectly calm
and still, its progress may be arrested and
danger averted. If not, it will assuredly
turn to brain-fever and must run its course.
Anything likely to rouse him in the smallest

542

degree, no matter whether it be pleasure or
pain, must be absolutely kept from him.
Only the sight of you might bring on an
excitement that might be  well, I was going
to say fatal. That is why I suggested to
his lordship to send off the telegram."

You knew I was coming down, then ?"
said Blanche.

My dear, I did know ; and But,

bless me, I ought to apologize to your ladyship
for my familiarity of speech," broke off
the kindly doctor, with a smile.

Blanche answered by smiling too, and
putting her hand into his.

I lost a daughter when she was about
your age, my dear ; you put me in mind of
her ; I said so to Mrs. Edwards when you
were here last autumn. She was my only
child, and my wife was already gone. Well,
well ! But that's beside the present question,"
he added briskly. '' Will you go back
to town. Lady Level ?"

'' I would rather remain, now I am here,"
she answered. '' At least, for a day or two.

I will take care not to show myself to Lord
Level."

Very well," said the doctor, rising. " Do
not let him either hear you or see you. I
shall be in aofain at nine to-niofht."

Who is nursing him ?" asked Blanche.

Mrs. Edwards. She is the best nurse
in the world. Snow, the head gardener,
helps occasionally ; he will watch by him tonight
; and Deborah fetches and carries."

Lady Level took contrition to herself as
she sat alone. She had been mentally accusing
her husband of all sorts of things,
whilst he was really lying in peril of his life.
Matters and mysteries pertaining to Marsh-dale
were not cleared up ; but  Blanche
could not discern any particular mystery towage
war with just now.

Tea was served to her, and Blanche would
not allow them to think of dinner. Mrs.
Edwards had a room prepared for her in a
different corridor from Lord Level's, so that
he would not be in danger of hearing her
voice or footsteps.

Very lonely felt Blanche when twilight
fell, as she sat at the window. She thought
she had never seen trees look so melancholy
before, and she recalled what Charles Strange
had always said  that the sight of trees in
the gloaming caused him to be curiously depressed.
Presently, wrapping a blue cloud
about her head and shoulders, she strolled
out of doors.

It was nearly dark now, and the overhanging'
trees made it darker. Blanche
strolled to the front gate and looked up and
down the road. Not a soul was about ; nota
sound broke the stillness. The house behind
her was gloomy enough ; no light to be
seen save the faint one that burnt in Lord
Level's chamber, whose windows faced this
way ; or a flash that now and then appeared
in the passages from a lamp carried by someone
moving about.

Blanche walked up and down, now in this
path, noY/ in that, now sitting on a bench
to think, under the dark trees. By-and-by,
she heard the front door open and someone

come down the path, cross to the side path,
unlock the small door that led into the garden
of the East Winof and enter it. By the very
faint light remaining, she thought she recognised
John Snow, the gardener.

She distinctly heard his footsteps pass up
the other garden ; she distinctly heard the
front door of the East Wing open to admit
him, and close again. Prompted by idle
curiosity, Blanche also approached the little
door in the wall, found it shut, but not locked,
opened it, went in, advanced to where she
had full view of the wing, and stood gazing
up at it. Like the other part of the house,
it loomed out dark and gloomy : the upper
windows appeared to have outer bars before
them ; at least, Blanche thought so. Only
in one room was there any light.

It was in a lower room, a sitting-room, no
doubt. The lamp, standing on the centre
table, was bright ; the window was thrown
up. Beside it sat someone at work ; crochet-work,
or knitting, or tatting ; something or
other done with the fingers. Mrs. Snow

amusing herself, thought Blanche at first ;
but in a moment she saw that it was not Mrs.
Snow. The face was dark and handsome,
and the black hair was adorned with black
lace. With a sensation as of some mortal
agony rushing and whirling through her
veins. Lady Level recognised her. It was
Nina, the Italian.

Nina, who had been the object of her
suspicious jealousy ; Nina, who was, beyond
doubt, the attraction that drew her husband
to Marshdale ; and who, as she fully believed,
had been the one to stab him a year ago !

Blanche crept back to her own garden.
Finding instinctively the darkest seat it contained,
she sat down upon it with a faint cry
of despair.

X THE EAST WING.

HAT will not a jealous and angry
woman do ? On the next morning
(Friday) Blanche Level, believing
herself to be more ignominiously
treated than ever wife was yet, despatched a
couple of telegrams to London, both of them
slightly incomprehensible. One of the telegrams
was to Charles Strange, the other to
Arnold Ravensworth ; and both where to the
same effect  they must hasten down to
Marshdale to her " protection " and 'rescue."
And Mr. Ravensworth was requested to
bring his wife.

She will be some little countenance forme

; I'm sme I dare not think how I must
be looked upon here," mentally spoke my
Lady Level in her glowing indignation.

Lord Level was better. When Mr. Hill
paid his early visit that Friday morning, he
pronounced him to be very much better ;
and John Snow said his lordship had passed
a quiet night. ''If we can only keep him
tranquil to-days and to-night again, there
will be no further danger from the fever,"
Mr. Hill then observed to Lady Level.

The day went on, the reports from the
sick-room continuing favourable : my lord
was lying tranquil, his mind clear. My
lady, down below, was anything but tranquil
: rather she felt herself in a raging
fever. In the evening, quite late, the two
gentlemen arrived from London, not having
been able to come earlier. Mrs. Ravens-worth
was not with them ; she could not
leave her delicate baby. Lady Level had
given orders for chambers to be prepared.

After they had partaken of refreshments,
which brought the time to ten o'clock,

Lady Level opened upon her grievances 
past and present. Modest and reticent
though her language still was, she contrived
to convey sundry truths to them. From
the early days of her marriage she had unfortunately
had cause to suspect Lord Level
of disloyalty to herself and of barefaced
loyalty to another. Her own eyes had seen
him more than once with the girl called
Nina at Pisa ; had seen him at her house,
sitting side by side with her in her garden
smoking and talking  had heard him address
her by her Christian name. This woman,
as she positively knew, had followed Lord
Level to England ; this woman was harboured
at Marshdale. She was in the house
now, in its East Wing. She, Blanche, had
seen her there the previous evening.

Mr. Ravensworth's severe countenance
took a stern expression as he listened ; he
believed every word. Charles Strange (I
am not speaking just here in my own person)
still thought there might be a mistake somewhere.
He could not readily take up so

bad an opinion of Lord Level, although circumstances
did appear to tell against him.
His incredulity irritated Blanche.

'' I will tell you, then, Charles, what I
have never disclosed to mortal man," she
flashed forth, in a passionate whisper, bending
forward her pretty face, now growing
whiter than death. '' You remember that
attack upon Lord Level last autumn. You
came down at the time, Arnold "

Yes, yes. What about it ?"

'' It was that woman who stabbed him !"

Neither spoke for a moment. '' Nonsense,
Blanche !" said Mr. Strange.

But I tell you that it was. She was in
night-clothes, or something of that kind, and
her black hair was falling about her ; but I
could not mistake her Italian face."

Mr. Ravensworth did not forget Lady
Level's curious behaviour at the time ; he
had thought then she suspected someone
in particular. " Are you sure f" he asked
her now.

I am sure. And you must both seethe

danger I may be in whilst here," she
added, with a shiver. '' That woman may
try to stab me, as she stabbed him. She
must have stabbed him out of jealousy,
because I  her rival  was there."

You had better quit the house the first
thing in the morning. Lady Level, and
return to London," said Mr. Ravensworth.

That I will not do," she promptly answered.
' I will not leave Marshdale until
these shameful doings's are investigated ; and
I have sent for you to act on my behalf and
bring them to light. No longer shall the
reproach be perpetually cast upon me by
papa and Charles Strange, that I complain
of my husband without cause. It is my
turn now."

That something must be done, in justice
to Lady Level, or at least attempted, they
both saw. But what, or how to set about
it, neither of them knew. They remained
in consultation together honors after Blanche
had retired to rest.

We will go out at daybreak and have a

look at the windows of this East Wing,"
finally observed Mr. Ravensworth.

Perhaps that was easier said than done.
With the gray light of early morning they
were both out of doors ; but they could not
find any entrance to the East Wing. The
door in the wall of the front garden was
locked ; the entrance gates from the road
were locked also. In the garden at the
back  it was more of a wilderness than a
garden  they discovered a small gate in a
corner. It was completely overgrown with
trees and shrubs, and had evidently not
been used for years and years. But the
wood had become rotten, the fastenings
loose ; and by their united strength they
opened it.

They found themselves in a very large
space of ground indeed. Grass was in the
middle, quite a field of it ; and round it a
broad gravel walk. Encompassing all on
three sides rose a wide bank of shrubs and
overhanging trees. Beyond these again was
a very high wall. On the fourth side stood

the East Wing, high and gloomy. Its windows
were all encased with iron bars, and
the lower windows were whitened.

Taking a survey of all this, one of them
softly whispering in surprise, Mr. Ravens
advanced to peer in at the windows.
Of course, being whitened, he had his trouble
for his pains.

It puts me in mind of a prison," remarked
Charles Strange.

'' It ]puts me in mind of a madhouse," was
the laconic rejoinder of Mr. Ravensworth.

They passed back through the gate again,
Mr. Ravensworth turning to take a last look.
In that minute his eye was attracted to one
of the windows on the ground floor. It
opened down the middle, like a French one,
and was being shaken, apparently with a
view to opening it  and if you are well
acquainted with continental windows, or
windows made after their fashion, you may
remember how long it has taken you to
shake a refractory window before it will
obey. It was at length effected, and in the

opening, gazing with a vacant, silly expression
through the close bars, appeared a face.
It remained in view but a moment ; the
window was immediately closed again, Mr.
Ravensworth thought by another hand.
What was the mystery ?

That some mystery did exist at Marsh-dale,
apart from any Italian ladies who
might have no fair right to be there, was
pretty evident. At breakfast the gentlemen
related this little experience to Blanche.

Madame Blanche tossed her head in incredulity.
'' Don't be taken in," she answered.
Windows whitened and barred, indeed !
It is all done with a view to misleading
people. She was sitting at the oj9en window
at work on Thursday night."

After breakfast, resolved no longer to be
played with, Blanche proceeded upstairs to
Mr. Drewitt's rooms, her friends following
her, all three of them creeping by Lord
Level's chamber-door with noiseless steps.
His lordship was getting better quite
wonderfully, Mrs. Edwards had told them.

The old gentleman, in his quaint costume,
was in his sitting-room, taking his breakfast
alone. Mrs. Edwards took her meals anywhere,
and at any time, during her lord's
illness. Hearing strange footsteps in the
corridor, he rose to see whose they were,
and looked considerably astonished.

Does your ladyship want me ?" he
asked, bowing.

I  yes, I think I do," answered Lady
Level. " Who keeps the key of that door,
Mr. Drewitt ?" pointing to the strong oaken
door at the end of the passage.

I keep it, my lady."

Then will you be kind enough to unlock
it for me ? These gentlemen wish to examine
the East Wing."

The East Wing is private to his lordship,"
was the steward's reply, addressing
them all conjointly. " Without his authority
I cannot open it to anyone."

They stood contending a little Awhile : it
was like a repetition of the scene that had
been enacted there once before ; and, like

VOL. TII. 55

that, was terminated by the same individual
the surgeon.

It is all right, Mr. Drewitt." he said ;
' you can open the door of the East Wing ;
I bear you my lord's orders. I am going in
there to see a patient," he added to the
rest.

The steward produced a key from his
pocket, and put it into the lock. It was
surprising that so small a key should open
so massive a door.

They passed, wonderingly, through three
rooms en suite : a sitting-room, a bedroom,
and a bath-room. All these rooms looked
to the back of the house. Other rooms
there were on the same floor, which the
visitors did not touch upon. Descending
the staircase, they entered three similar
rooms below. In the smaller one lay some
garden-tools, but of a less size than a grown
man in his strength would use, and by their
side were certain toys : tops, hoops, ninepins,
and the like. The middle room was a
sitting-room ; the larger room beyond had

no furniture, and in that, standing over a
humming-top, which he had just set to spin
on the floor, bent the singular figure of a
youth. He had a dark, vacant face, wild
black eyes, and a mass of thick black hair,
cut short. This figure, a child's whip in his
hand, was whipping the top, and making a
noise with his mouth in imitation of its
hum.

Half madman, half idiot, he stood out, in
all his deep misfortune, raising himself up
and staring about him with a vacant stare.
The expression of Mr. Ravensworth's face
changed to one of pity. " Who are you ?"
he exclaimed in kindly tones. " What is
your name ?"

Arnie !" was the mechanical answer, for
brains and sense seemed to have little to do
with it ; and, catching up his top, he backed
against the wall, and burst into a distressing
laugh. Distressing to a listener ; not distressing
to him, poor fellow.

Who is he ?" asked Mr. Ravensworth
of the doctor.

5 52

An imbecile."

'* So I see. But what connection has he
with Lord Level's family ?"

'' He is a connection, or he would not be
here."

' Can he be  be  a son of Lord Level's ?"

*' A son 1" interposed the steward, " and
my lord but just married ! No, sir, he is
not a son, he is none so near as that ; he is
but a connection of the Level family."

The lad came forward from the wall where
he was standing, and held out his top to his
old friend the doctor. " Do, do," he cried,
spluttering as he spoke.

Nay, Arnie, you can set it up better
than I : my back won't stoop well,
Arnie."

' Do, do," was the persistent request, the
top held out still.

Mr. Ravensworth took it and set it up
again, he looking on in greedy eagerness, slobbering
and making a noise with his mouth.
Then his note changed to a hum, and he
whipped away as before.

Why is he not put away in an asylum ?"
asked Mr. Ravens worth.

Put away in an asylum !" retorted the
old steward indignantly. " Where could hebe
put to have the care and kindness that is
bestowed upon him here ? Imbecile though
he is, madman though he may be, he is
dear to me and my sister. We pass our
lives tending him, in conjunction with Snow
and his wife, doing for him, soothing him :
where else could that be done ? You don't
know what you are saying, sir. My lord,
who received the charge from his father,
comes down to see him : my lord orders that
everything should be done for his comfort.
And do you suppose it is fitting that his
condition should be made public ? The fact
of one being so afflicted is slur enough upon
the race of Level, without its being proclaimed
abroad."

It was he who attacked Lord Level last
year {

Yes, it was ; and how he could have
escaped to our part of the house will be a

marvel to me for ever. My sister says I
could not have slipped the bolt of the
passage door as usual, but I know I did bolt
it. Arnie had been restless that day ; he
has restless fits ; and I suppose he could not
sleep, and must have risen from his bed and
come to my sitting-room. On my table there
I had left my pocket-knife, a new knife, the
blades bright and sharp ; and this he must
have picked up and opened, and found his
way with it to my lord's chamber. Why
he should have attacked him, or anyone
else, I know not ; he never had a ferocious
fit before."

Never," assented Mr. Hill, in confirmation.


Mr. Drewitt continued : " He has been
imbecile and harmless as you see him now,
but he has never disturbed us at night ; he
has, as I say, fits of restlessness when he
cannot sleep, but he is sufficiently sensible
to ring a bell communicating with Snow's
chamber if he wants anything. If ever he
has rung, it has been to say he wants meat."

Meat !"

The steward nodded. " But it has never
been given to him. He is cunning as a
fox ; they all are ; and were we to begin
giving him food in the middle of the night
we must continue to do it, or have no peace.
Eating is his one enjoyment in life, and he
devours everything set before him  meat
especially. If we have any particular dainty
upstairs for dinner or supper, I generally
take him in some. Deborah, I believe,
thinks I eat all that comes up, and sets me
down for a cannibal. He has a hot supper
every night. About a year ago we got to
think it might be better for him to have a
lighter one, and we tried it for a week ; but
he moaned and cried all night long for his
hot meat, and we had to give it him again.
The night this happened we had veal cutlets
and bacon, and he had the same. He asked
for more, but I would not give it ; perhaps
that angered him, and he mistook my lord
for me. Mr. Hill thought it might be so.
I shall never be able to account for it."

The doctor nodded assent ; and the speaker
went on :

'' His hair was long then, and he must
have looked just like a maniac when the fit
of fury lay upon him. Little wonder that
my lady was frightened at the sight of him.
After he had done the deed he ran back to
his own room ; I, aroused by the commotion,
found him in his bed. He burst out laughing
when he saw me : ' I got your knife, I
got your knife,' he called out, as if it were a
feat to be proud of. His movements must
have been silent and stealthy, for Snow had
heard nothing."

At this moment there occurred an interruption.
The Italian lady approached
the room with timid, hesitating steps, and
peeped in. '' Ah, how do you do, doctor ?"
she said in a sweet, gentle voice, as she held
out her hand to Mr. Hill. Her countenance
was mild, open, and honest ; and a conviction
rushed on the instant into Blanche's
mind that she had been misjudging that
foreign lady.

** These good gentle people are come to see
our poor patient ?" she added, curtseying to
them with native grace, her accent quite
foreign. " The poor, poor boy," tears filling
her eyes. " And I foretell that this must
be my lord's wife !" addressing Blanche.
Will she permit a poor humble stranger
to shake her by the hand for her lord's
sake  her lord, who has been so good tous?"


This lady is sister to the unfortunate
boy's mother," said the doctor, in low tones
to Blanche. " She is a good woman, and
worthy to shake hands with you, my lady."

But who was his father ?" whispered
Blanche.

'' Mr. Francis Level ; my lord's dead
brother."

Her countenance radiant, Blanche took
the lady's hand and warmly clasped it.
You live here to take care of the poor
lad," she said.

But no, madam. I do but come at
intervals to see him, all the way from Pisa,

in Italy. And also I have had to come to
bring documents and news to my lord, respecting
matters that concern him and the
poor lad. But it is over now' she added.
** The week after the one next to come,
Arnie goes back with me to Italy, his native
country, and my journeys to this country
will be ended. His mother, who is always
ill and not able to travel, wishes now to have
her afflicted son with her."

Back in the other house aofain, after wishing
Nina Sparlati good-day, the astonished
visitors gathered in Mr. Drewitt's room to
listen to the tale which had to be told them.
Mrs. Edwards, Who was awaiting them, and
fonder of talking than her brother, was the
principal narrator. Blanche went away,
whispering to Charles Strange that she
would hear it from him afterwards.

'' We were abroad in Italy," Mrs. Edwards
began : '' it is many years ago. The late
lord, our master then, went for his health,
which was declining, though he was but a
middle-aged man, and I and my brother

were with him, his personal attendants, but
treated more like friends. The present lord,
Mr. Archibald, named after his father, was
with us  he was the second son, not the
heir ; the eldest son, Mr. Level  Francis
was his name  had been abroad for years,
and was then in another part of Italy. He
came to see his father when we first got out
to Florence, but he soon left again.  He'll
die before my lord,' I said to Mr. Archibald ;
for if ever I saw consumption on a man's
face, it was on Mr. Level's. And I remember
Mr. Archibald's answer as if it was
but yesterday :  That's just one of your
fancies, nurse : Frank tells me he has looked
the last three years as he looks now.' But
I was right, sir ; for shortly after that we
received news of the death of Mr. Level ;
and then Mr. Archibald was the heir. My
lord, who had grown worse instead of better,
was very ill then."

Did the late lord die in Italy ?" questioned
Mr. Ravensworth.

You shall hear, sir. He grew very ill,

I say, and we thought he would be sure to
move homewards, but he still stayed on.
Archibald likes Florence,' he would say,
and it's all the same to me where I am.'
Young Level stops for the beaux yeux of
the Tuscan women,' the world said  but you
know, sir, the world always was censorious ;
and young men will be young men. However,
we were at last on the move ; everything
was packed and prepared for leaving,
when there arrived an ill-favoured young
woman, with some papers and a little child,
two years old. Its face frightened me when
I saw it. It was, as a child, what it is now
as a growing man ; and you have seen it today,"
she added in a whisper. " ' What is
the matter with him ?' I asked, for I could
S23eak a little Italian. ' He's a born natural,
as yet,' she answered, ' but the doctors think
he may outgrow it in part.'  But who is
he ? what does he do here ?' I said.  He's
the son of Mr. Level,' she replied, ' and I
have brought him to the family, for his
mother, who was my sister, is also dead.'

He the son of Mr. Level !' I uttered, knowing
she must speak of Mr. Francis. ' Well,
you need not bring him here : we English do
not recognise chance children.' ' They were
married three years ago,' she coolly answered,
and I have brought the papers to prove it.
Mr. Level was a gentleman and my sister
not much above a peasant ; but she was
beautiful and good, and he married her, and
this is their child. She has been dying by
inches since her husband died ; she is now
dead, and I am come here to give up the
child to his father's people."

Was it true ?" interrupted Mr. Strange.

'' My lord thought so, sir, and took
kindly to the child. He was brought home
here, and the East Wing was made his
nursery "

Then that  that  poor wretch down
there is the true Lord Level !" interrupted
Mr. Ravensworth.

One day, when my lord was studying the
documents the woman had left," resumed
Mrs. Edwards, passing by the remark with a

glance, " something curious struck him in
the certificate of marriage : he thought it
was forged. He showed it to Mr. Archibald,
and they decided to go back to Italy, leaving
the child here. All the inquiries they made
there tended to prove that, though the child
was indeed Mr. Francis Level's, there had
been no marriage, or semblance of one. All
the same, said my lord, the poor child shall
be kindly reared and treated and provided
for : and Mr. Archibald solemnly promised
his father it should be so. My lord died at
Florence, and Mr. Archibald came back Lord
Level."

 And he never forgot his promise to his
father," interposed the steward, " but has
treated the child almost as thouoi-h he were
a true son, consistent with his imbecile state.
That East Wing has been his happy home,
as Mr. Hill can testify : he has toys to
amuse him, the garden to dig in, which is
his favourite pastime ; and Snow draws him
about the paths in his hand-carriage on fine
days. It is a sad misfortune, for him and

for the family ; but my lord has done his
best."

' It would have been a greater for my
lord had the marriage been a legal one," remarked
Mr. Ravensworth.

I don't know that," sharply spoke up
the doctor. " As an idiot I believe he could
not inherit. However, the marriage was
not a legal one, and my lord is my lord.
The mother is not dead ; that was a fabrication
also ; but she is ill, helpless, and is
pining for her son ; so now he is to be taken
to her ; my lord, in his generosity, securing
him an ample income. It was not the
mother who perpetrated the fraud, but the
avaricious eldest sister. This sister, the one
you have just seen, is the youngest ; she is
good and honourable, and has done her best
to unravel the plot."

That was all the explanation given to Mr.
Ravensworth. But the doctor put his arm
within that of Charles Strange, and took
him into the presence of Lord Level.

' Well," said his lordship, who was then

sitting up in bed, and held out his hand,
have you been hearing all about the
mysteries, Charles ?"

'' Yes," smiled Mr. Strange. " I felt sure
that whatever the mystery might be, it was
one you could safely explain away if you
chose."

Ay : though Blanche did take up the
other view and want to cut my head off."

' She was your own wife, your loving wife,
I am certain : why not have told her ?"

Because I wanted to be quite sure of
certain things first," replied Lord Level.
Listen, Charles : you have my tale to hear
yet. Sit down. Sit down. Hill. How am
I to talk while you stand ?" he asked,
laughing.

'when we were in Paris after our marriage
a year ago, I received two shocks on one
and the same morning," began Lord Level.
The one told me of the trouble Tom Heriot
had fallen into ; the other, contained in a
letter from Pisa, informed me that there
had been a marriage after all between my

brother and that girl, Bianca Sparlati. If
so, of course, that imbecile lad stood between
nie and the title and estate ; though I don't
think he could legally inherit. But I did
not believe the information. I felt sure
that it was another invented artifice of
Annette, the wretched eldest sister, who is
a grasping intricate. I started at once
for Pisa, where they live, to make inquiries
in person : travelling by all sorts of routes,
unfrequented by the English, that my wife
might not hear of her brother's disgrace. At
Pisa I found difficulties : statements met me
that seemed to prove there had been a marriage,
and I did not see my way to disprove
them. Nina, a brave, honest girl, confessed
to me that she doubted them, and I begged
of her, for truth and right's sake, to help meas
far as she could. I cannot enter into
details now. Strange ; I am not strong
enough for it ; enough to say that ever
since, nearly a whole year, have I been
trying to ferret out the truth : and I only
got at it a week ago."

VOL. III. 5 6

And there was no marriage ?"

"Tell him, Hill," said Lord Level,
laughing.

Well, a sort of ceremony did pass
between Francis Level and that young
woman, but both of them knew at the time
it was not legal, or one that could ever stand
good," said the doctor. " Now the real
facts have come to light. It seems that
Bianca had been married when very young
to a sailor named Dromio ; within a month
of the wedding he sailed away again and did
not return. She thought him dead, took
up her own name again and went home to
her family ; and later became acquainted
with Francis Level. Now, the sailor has
turned up again, alive and well "

The first husband !" exclaimed Charles
Strange.

If you like to call him so," said Mr
Hill ; ' there was never a second. Well,
the sailor has come to the fore again ; and
honest-hearted Nina travelled here from
Pisa with the news, and we sent for his

lordship to come down and hear it. He
was also wanted for another matter. The
boy had had a sort of fit, and I feared he
would die. My lord heard what Nina had
to tell him when he arrived ; he did not
return at once to London, for Arnie was
still in danger, and he waited to see the
issue. Very shortly he was taken ill himself,
and could not get away. It was good
news, though, about that resuscitated sailor !"
laughed the doctor, after a pause. ' All's
well that ends well, and my Lord Level is
his own man again."

Charles Strange sought an interview with
his sister  as he often called her  and imparted
to her these particulars. He then
left at once for London with Mr. Ravens-worth.
Their mission at Marshdale was over.

Lord Level, up and dressed, lay on a sofa
in his bedroom in the afternoon. Blanche
sat on a footstool beside him. Her face
was hidden upon her husband's knee and she
was crying bitter tears.

5 62

Shall you ever forgive me, Archibald ?"

He was smiling quietly. ' Some husbands
might say no."

You don't know how miserable I have
been."

' Don't I ! But how came you to fall
into such notions at first, Blanche ? To
suspect me of ill at all ?"

It was that Mrs. Page Reid who was
with us at Pisa. She said all sorts of
things."

Ah !"

Wont you forgive me, Archibald ?"

 Yes, upon condition that you trust me
fully in future. Will you, love ?" he softly
whispered.

She could not speak for emotion.

 And the next time you have a private
grievance against me, Blanche, tell it out
plainly," he said, as he held her to him and
gave her kiss for kiss.

My darling, yes. But I shall never
have another."

Conclusion.

CHARLES Strange, took
up this story at its commencement,
and I take it up now
at its close.

It was a lovely day at the end of summer,
in the year following the events recorded in
the last chapter, and we were again at
Marshdale House.

The two individuals who had chiefly
marred the peace of one or another of us
in the past were both gone where disturbance
is not. Poor Tom Heriot was mouldering
in his grave near to that in which his

father and mother lay, not having been discovered
by the police or molested in anyway
; and the afflicted Italian lad had died
soon after he was taken to his native land.
Mr. Hill had warned Nina Sparlati that, in
all probability, he would not live long. Mrs.
Brightman, I may as well say it here,
had recovered permanently ; recovered in all
ways, as we hoped and believed. The long
restraint laid upon her by her illness had
effected the cure that nothing else might
have been able to effect, and re-established
the good habits she had lost. But Miss
Brightman was dead ; she had not lived to
come home from Madeira, and the whole of
her fortune was left to Annabel. " So you
can live where you please now and go
in for grandeur," Arthur Lake said to me
and my wife. " All in good time," laughed
Annabel ; ' I am not yet tired of Essex
Street."

And now we had come down in the sunny
August weather when the courts were upto
stay at Marshdale.

You might be slow to recognise it, though.
Recalling the picture of Marshdale House
as it was, and looking at it now, many would
have said it could not be the same.

The dreary old structure had been converted
into a light and beautiful mansion.
The whitened windows with their iron bars
were no more. The disfiguring, unnaturally-high
walls were gone, and the tangled shrubs
and weeds, the overgrowth of trees that had
made the surrounding land a wilderness,
were now turned into lovely pleasure-grounds.
The gloomy days had given place
to sunny ones, said Lord Level, and the
gloomy old structure, with its gloomy secrets,
should be remembered no more.

Marshdale was now their chief home, his
and his wife's, with their establishment of
servants. Mr. Drewitt and Mrs. Edwards
had moved into a pretty dwelling hard by ;
but they were welcomed whenever they
liked to go to the house, and were treated
as friends. The steward kept the accounts
still, and Mrs. Edwards was appealed to by

Blanche in all domestic difficulties. She
rarely appeared before her lady but in her
quaint gala attire.

We were taking tea out of doors at the
back of the renovated East Wing. The air
bore that Sabbath stillness which Sunday
seems to bring : distant bells, ringing the
congregation out of church, fell melodiously
on the ear. We had been idle this afternoon
and stayed at home, but all had attended
service in the morning. Mr. Hill had called
in and was sitting with us. Annabel presided
at the rustic tea-table ; Blanche was a
great deal too much occupied with her baby-boy,
whom she had chosen to have brought
out : a lively young gentleman in a blue
sash, whose face greatly resembled his
father's. Next to Lord Level sat my uncle,
who had come down for a week's rest. He
was no longer Serjeant Stillingfar ; but Sir
Charles, and one of her Majesty's judges.

Won't you have some tea, my dear ?"
he said to Blanche, who was parading the
baby.

By the way, they had named him Charles.
Charles Archibald ; to be called by the
former name : Lord Level protested he would
not have people saying Young Archie and
Old Archie.

 Yes, Blanche," said he, taking up the
suofofestion of the iudoe. " Do let that child
go indoors : one might think he was a new
toy. Here, I'll take him."

Archibald need not talk," laughed
Blanche, looking after her husband, who
had taken the child from her and was tossing
it as he went indoors. " He is just as fond
of having the baby as I am. Neither need
you laugh, Mr. Charles," turning upon me ;
 your turn will come soon, you know."

Leaving the child in its nursery in the
East Wing, Lord Level came back to his
place ; and we sat on until evening approached.
A peaceful evening, promising a
glorious sunset. An hour after midday,
when we had just got safely in from church,
there had been a storm of thunder and
lightning, and it had cleared the sultry air.

The blue sky above, flecked with gold, was
of a lovely rose colour towards the west.

'' The day has been a type of life : or of
what life ought to be," suddenly remarked
Mr. Hill. " Storm and cloud succeeded by
peace and sunshine."

The end is not always peaceful," said
Lord Level.

It mostly is when we have worked on
for it patiently," said the judge. " My
friends, you may take the word of an old
man for it  that a life of storm and trouble,
through which we have struggled manfully
to do our duty under God, ever bearing on
in reliance upon Him, must of necessity end
in peace. Perhaps not always perfect and
entire peace in this world ; but assuredly
in that which is to come."
