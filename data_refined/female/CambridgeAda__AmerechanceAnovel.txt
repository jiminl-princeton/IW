CHAPTER I.

ANOTHER Each Promise.

R. KINGSTON, as soon as he
received Mrs. Thornley's invitation,
sent a telegram to her
nearest post-town, to tell her he would
start for Adelonga on the following
day, and await at the inn where he left
the railway the buggy she was kind
enough to say should be sent to meet him.
There was much amusement at



VOL. II.

Adelonga over this unwonted promptitude
on the part of an idle and self-indulgent
man, who had never been known
to hurry himself, or to go into the
country willingly ; and Rachel was teased
in fun and congratulated in earnest on
the strong hold she had gained upon
his ere while erratic affections.

The buggy was ordered at once 
Mr. Thornley's own pet Abbott buggy,
that floated over the rough roads 
and a pet pair of horses were harnessed
into it, and another pair sent
forward to change with them on the
way, and Mr. Thornley himself set forth
to meet his guest.

Next day Lucilla ordered one of
her best rooms  usually reserved for
married ladies  to be prepared for
him, and had great consultations with

her cook on his behalf ; and at
about five in the afternoon he arrived,
wrapped in a fur-collared overcoat, like
a traveller in bleak and barren regions,
and had a royal welcome.

Lucilla, followed by her mother, went
out to the verandah to meet her old
friend  though, indeed, she never willingly
omitted that graceful act of
hospitality, whoever might be her guest
and was delighted to receive again
the same old compliment on her charming
appearance that had pleasantly
fooled her in her maiden days. Mrs.
Hardy was likewise greeted with effusion,
and responded cordially; and then
they all looked round.

'where is Rachel?" inquired Mr.
Kingston, with anxious solicitude; "isn't
she well?"

202

Eacliel was found in the drawing-room,
nervously re-arranging the cups and
saucers that had just been brought in for
tea. Lucilla ushered him in with a smile,
and discreetly retired with her mother,
upon some utterly unnecessary errand.

The lovers met in the middle of the
room, and Each el went through the
ordeal that she had been vaguely
dreading all day. It was worse than
she had expected, for she felt, by
some subtle, newly-developed sense,
that she had been greatly missed and
ardently longed for, and that they
were truly lover's arms that folded her,
trembling and shrinking, in that apparently
interminable embrace.

She had not yet come to realise
the magnitude and the ignominy of the
wrong that she was doing him, but a

pang of remorseful pity did hurt her
somewhere, through all her stony irresponsiveness,
for the fate that had driven
him, the desired of so many women, to
set his heart at last upon one who did
not want it.

For a brief intolerable moment she
felt that she had it in her to implore
him to release her from her
engagement, but  well, she was a
little coward, if the truth must be told.

And, moreover, she had not quite come
to the point of giving up her pink
boudoir, and her diamond necklace,
and all her other splendid possessions
in prospect, because she could not love
the contingent husband as was her duty
to him to do.

She did not know as yet that she
loved another man.

And you never came to meet me ?"
said Mr. Kingston, with tender reproach,
as he led her by one reluctant hand to
a sofa that was wheeled up comfortably
to the fireside. " And 1 was straining my
eyes all across the paddock, to see you on
the verandah looking out."

'' I was looking out," said Rachel ; " I
saw the buggy before it reached the

woolshed. But "

But you thought it would be nicer
to have our meeting heros with no
one to look on? So it is, darling;
you were quite right. I could not have
helped kissing you, if all the servants on
the place had been standing round ; and
one doesn't like to make a public exhibition
of one's self. Oh, my pet, I am so
glad to get you again ! And how are
you ? Let me have a good look at you.

Oh, if you are going to blush, how am I to
tell whether you are looking well or
not ?"

I am not going to blush,"
said Rachel ; " and I am quite
well. I never was better. The
country air is doing me ever so much
good."

I am not so sure of that," rejoined Mr.
Kingston, rather gravely, stroking her
soft cheek. '' You look fagged, as if
you had been knocking about too much.
I didn't like your going to those rubbishy
little races  I told Thornley so. Have
you been sitting up late at night ?"

No  I have been doing nothing''
pleaded Rachel ; ''I am really as well as
possible. How is the house getting on ?"

The house is not doing much at
present. They are still pottering at the

foundations, which seem to take a frightful
lot of doing to. Not that the have
had time to make much progress since you
were there  it is not much over a
fortnight yet, you know. Oh, but it has
been a long fortnight ! Rachel, now I
have got you, I don't mean to lose
sight of you again."

How did you leave Beatrice ?" inquired
Rachel, hastily.

Beatrice is quite well  as sprightly
as ever. 1 told her I meant to bring
you back to town, by force of arms if
necessary, and she said I was quite right.
We can't do without you in Melbourne 
I can't, anyhow; and what's more, T
don't mean to try."

How is Uncle Hardy ?"
' Uncle Hardy? I'm sure I don't
know I was very nearly saying I don't

care. Of course tie is quite well ; lie
always is, I believe. Is there anybody
else you are particularly anxious about,
Mademoiselle ?"

"Yes," said Rachel, smiling and blushing;
" I am anxious about Black Agnes.
How is my dear Black Agnes ? Dues
William attend to her properly ?"

I don't leave her to "William," said
Mr. Kingston. " I have taken her away
to my own stables. And there she is
eating her head off  wanting yon, like the
rest of ns. If you have no more
questions to ask, I'll begin ; may I ? I
have some really important inquiries to
make."

Rachel gasped. But to her immense
relief Lucilla was heard approaching,
talking at an unnecessarily high pitch of
voice to her mother, who responded with

equal vigour ; and the two ladies entered,
followed by Mr. Thornley, all wearing a
more or less deprecatory aspect.

The men and the matrons grouped
themselves round the fire, and plunged
into an animated discussion of the latest
Melbourne news. Rachel poured out the
tea, and insisted on carrying it round to
everybody, regardless of polite protests ;
which charmed her lover Yere much.

He was rather cold, and a little stiff
and tired after his unwonted exertion ;
his seat was soft and restful ; and he liked
to see the slender creature gliding
about, with her sweet face and her
deft hands, and picture to himself with
what meek dutifulness she would serve
her lord and master when the time
came.

Rachel hoped they were in for a

pleasant gossip till dinner time, but she
was much mistaken.

*' I must go and see after mj baby,
Mr. Kingston, if you will excuse me,"
said Lucilla at the end of half-an-hour,
setting down her empty but still smoking
teacup, and rising with an air that
implied a pressing duty postponed to
the very last moment. Mr. Kingston
expressed an ardent desire to make the
baby's acquaintance, which flattered the
young mother greatly, but otherwise
led to nothing. Lucilla went out,
promising to introduce her son under
favourable auspices in the morning;
and as she disappeared, Mrs. Hardy
jumped up and followed her with apparently
anxious haste.

"Oh, Lucilla, I quite forgot that
aconite for Dolly's cold !" she exclaimed

; " shall I come and look for it
now?"

Mr. Tliornley, left behind, stood on
the hearth rug, shifting uneasily from
one leg to the other. He cleared his
throat, remarked that the days were
lengthening wonderfully, moved some
ornaments on the chimney-piece, and
looked at his watch.

Dear me," he muttered briskly, as
if struck with a sudden thought, '' a
quarter to six, I do declare ! Excuse
me a few minutes, Kingston."

Certainly," replied Mr. Kingston.
And then he went out.

How stupid they are !" cried poor
Rachel to herself, almost stamping her
foot with vexation. But there was no
help for it. The affianced couple were
once more left to themselves  as affianced

couples should be, and should like to be
in the pleasant firelight and no less
pleasant twilight shadows that were
filling the quiet room.

Mr. Kingston rose, took his reluctant
sweetheart's hand, and led her back
to the sofa by the hearth.

What time do they have dinner
here ?" he asked.

Seven o'clock," said Rachel, with a
sinking heart.

'' Then we shall have nearly an hour
to ourselves, shan't we? Come then,
and let us have a good long talk.
But first, I've got something for
you."

He began to fumble in his pockets,
and presently drew forth a little square
packet, neatly sealed up in paper,
which he laid on Rachel's knee. Wiseman

! he had not had his long and
varied experiences for nothing.

The girl in smiling perplexity turned
the mysterious parcel over and over,
broke first one seal and then another
with much delicate elaboration ; cautiously
stripped off the paper wrappings,
and revealed, as she expected, a morocco
jewel-case.

Oh, how kind !" she murmured,
stroking it caressingly with her white
fingers.

'' Open it before you say that," said
he; '' you don't know that there is
anything in it yet."

Ah, but I know your ways," she
rejoined ; " I know it is sure to be
something lovely." And then she lifted
the lid, and exclaimed " 0-o-oh !" with
a long breath. There lay, on a bed of

blue velvet, a beautiful little watch,
thickly set on one side of the case
with tiny diamond sparks, which on
examination proved to illuminate the
flourishes of a big R ; and a chain
of proportionate value was coiled around
it.

Rachel was in ecstacies. She had
longed for a watch all her life, and
had never yet had one, except an old
silver warming-pan of her father's,
which would not go into a lady's
pocket.

It was only lately that Mr. Kingston
had discovered this fact ; and he had
immediately had one prepared for her,
such as he considered would be worthy
of her future position in society, and
of his own reputation for good taste.
He felt himself well repaid for his

outlay at this moment. Of lier own
accord lie put up her soft lips and
kissed him, pouring out her childish
gratitude for his thoughtfulness, and
his kindness, and his goodness, in
broken exclamations which were charmingly
naive and sweet.

You are always giving me things,"
she murmured, shyly stroking his coat
sleeve.

Dear little woman !" he responded,
with ardent embraces, from which she
did not shrink  at least, not much ; "it
is my greatest pleasure in life to give
you things."

And from this substantial base of
operations the astute lover opened
the campaign which was to deliver
her, a helpless captive, into his
hands.

"And now' lie said, when the watch
having been consigned to its pocket in
her pretty homespun gown, and the
chain artistically festooned from a
button-hole at her waist, a suggestive
silence fell upon them  '' now I want
to know what you mean by saying
you won't be married till next year ?
Naughty child, you made me very
miserable with that letter. Though to
be sure it was better than the other
one, which was so horribly, so really
brutally, cold that I had to go to the
fire to get warm after reading it. Oh,
Rachel, you are not half in love yet, I
fear !"

*' Don't say that," she murmured, with
tender compunction.

And I believe that is why you wish

to put off our marriage."
TOL. II. 21

Oh, don't say that !" she repeated,
weakly anxious to re-assure and conciliate
him, and to postpone unpleasantness
 woman-like, afraid of the very
opportunity that she wanted when she
saw herself unexpectedly confronted
with it. " I don't wish to put it off 
only for a little while."

'' Do you call till next year a little
while ? Because I don't."

Of course it is. Why, here is
August !"

'' And there are five long months 
double the time we have been engaged
already. And it wouldn't be comfortable
to be travelling in the hot
season."

You said spring would be a nice
time," suggested Rachel. She was
touching his sleeve with timid, deprecatory

caresses, and she was desperately
frightened and anxious.

Yes ; this spring  not twelve months
hence. Oh, my pet, do let it be this
spring. There are three lovely months
before us, and I should like to get
that Sydney house. I have the offer
of it still for a few days ; I got them
to keep it open till I could consult
you. You must remember that I am
not as young as you are, Rachel ; a year
one way or the other may be of no
account to you, but it is of very great
importance to me."

There was a touch of impatience
and irritation in his voice, which helped
her to pluck up courage to cling to
her resolve.

At the same time she heard the soft
ticking of that precious watch at her

212

side ; lier heart was touched. and warmed
bj what she called his " kindness ;"
and she was anxious to do anything
that she could do to please him.

"Won't it do when the house is
built?" she asked, in a wheedling,
cowardly, coaxing tone, as she laid her
cheek for a moment on his shoulder.
I will come back to Melbourne as
soon as you like  I can stay with
Beatrice, if aunt likes to remain here.
We can be together almost as if we
were married. We can ride together
every day, and watch how the house
goes on; and you know aunt doesn't
mind hoi much you are with us at
Toorak. Only if you would consent to
put off the wedding till then  "

'' Will you promise to marry me then ?"
he asked quickly.

Yes, I will, really," lie replied,

without any hesitation, thankful for the

reprieve, which she had been by no

means sure of getting.

"As soon as the house is built?"
"As soon as the house is finished."
No  not finished ; that mayn't be

next year, nor the year after. As soon

as the roof is on ?"
Each el paused.

How long does that take ?"
Oh, a long time  ever so long."
She paused again, with a longer pause.

And then,

Very well," she sighed, resignedly.
"It is a bargain? You promise

faithfully ? On your solemn word of

honour ?"

Oh, don't make such a terrible

thing of it !" she protested, with a rather

hysterical laugh, that showed signs of
degenerating into a whimper. " I can
only say I will."

"And that is enough, my sweet. I
won't require you to reduce it to
writing. Your word shall be your bond.
It is a long while to wait, but I must
try to be patient. At any rate, it is
a comfort to be done with uncertainty,
and to have a fixed time to arrange
for. And now, perhaps, we ought to
go and dress. Tell me how much it
wants to seven, Rachel; you have the
correct Melbourne time."

THE BEGINNING OE TROUBLES.

T was in the afternoon that
Lucilla again expected her
guests, on the day of the
ball given at Adelonga in honour of
the coming of age of her absent stepson
; and the hospitable arrangements
characteristic of bush households on
such occasions, were made for their
reception on the usual Adelonga scale.
All the visitors were to be *' put up "
of course; and from the exhaustless

piles of material stowed away in the
ample store-rooms, bed-rooms were improvised
in every hole and corner, and
beds made up wherever beds could
decently go  in the store-rooms themselves,
in the school-room, in the
laundry, in the gardener's cottage, as
well as in the numerous guest-chambers
with which this, in common with other
Australian " country seats," was regularly
supplied.

Bright log pares burned on every
hearth; bright spring flowers adorned
all the ladies' dressing-tables; stupendous
viands piled the pantry shelves and
filled the spacious kitchens with delectable
odours.

Servants bustled about with a festive
air.

Mr. Thornley, in shirt sleeves, brought

forth treasures from the remote recesses
of his cellar that no one but he was
competent to meddle with.

Mrs. Thornlej moved complacently
about her extensive domain, regulating
all these exceptional arrangements with
that housewifely good sense and judgment
which distinguished all Mrs. Hardy's
daughters.

Rachel found her sphere of action in
the ball-room, where with Miss O'Hara
and the children, a young gardener to
supply material, the station carpenter
to do the rough work, and Mr.
Kingston to look on and criticise from
an arm-chair by the fire, she worked
all day at the decorations, which had
been designed in committee and partly
prepared the day before. The great
Japanese screens had been carried away

(to be made very useful in the construction
of bed and bath-rooms) and
the carpets taken up ; and now she
feathered the great empty room all
about with fern-tree fronds  hanging
them from extemporised chandeliers, and
from wire netting stretched over the
ceiling, and from doorless doorways,
rooted in masses of shrubs and blossoms
that made a bower of the whole place.
It was just such a task as she delighted
in, and she was considered to have
completed it successfully at four o'clock,
when she put her finishing touches
to a trophy over the chimney-piece,
which, though rather complicated as
to symbolism, being arranged on a
foundation of breech-loaders and riding-whips,
had a bold and pleasing
effect.

At four o'clock the guests began to
arrive. She was directing her attendants
to sweep up the last of her litters from
the newly-polished floor, when the Digbys'
waggonette drove in at the wide-standing
garden gates, and rattled upto
the house.

After them came other buggies in
quick succession. Grooms and house
servants poured out to receive them ;
doors banged ; confused voices and
laughter rose and fell in waves of
pleasant sound through the maze of
passages intersecting the rabbit-warren
of a house.

Rachel ran to a window and looked
out in time to see Lucifer led off to
the stables blowing and panting, and
jangling his bridle, but stepping out
still with unconquered spirit, as became

a brave old horse of noble lineage, whom
such a master owned.

Mr. Kingston, the only other person
just then in the room, came behind her
and laid his hands with the air of a
proprietor on her shoulders.

"Whose hack is that?" he inquired,
with languid curiosity. '' Looks a good
sort of breed, something like your mare
in colour, only much bigger."

Mr. Dalrymple's," murmured Rachel.

Dalrymple ?  that brother of Mrs.
Digby's you spoke of ? I've heard of
that fellow. I was curious to know
who he was, and I made inquiries at
the club. He is a rather considerable
scamp, if all tales are true."

All tales are not true," replied the
girl, with majestic calmness.

And pray how do you know ?" he

retorted quickly, a little amused and a
great deal irritated by her highly indiscreet
behaviour. '' I don't suppose
that you have heard all that I have
at any rate, I hoje not."

I know enough," she stammered
hurriedly; "I know the worst anyone
can say against him."

'' I hope not," repeated Mr. Kingston,
with ominous gravity.

And I know he has done wrongs
done very wrong, indeed ; but he
has had such terrible provocations  he
has been, oh, so dreadfully unfortunate
!" she went on, wishing heartily
that she had not undertaken her new
friend's defence, yet finding it easier
to go through with it now than to
turn back and desert him. 'rand,
whatever he may have been once, he

is doing nothing to harm anybody
now; and it is cruel of people to be
always raking up the past, when it is
done with and repented of, and throwing
it in his teeth. Any of us would
think it hard and unfair  you would
yourself."

Never mind me, my dear ; my past
is not being called in question that I
am aware of."

Mr. Kingston's not very placid temper
was rising.

He is doing nothing wrong now,"
she repeated, frightened but reckless ;
*' if he were, Mr. Thornley would not
invite him here  he said so himself.
And Lucilla, though she does not like
him  nobody likes him, indeed  says
he would never do a mean action,
and that he has perfect manners,

and that lie is a thorough gentleman
every way. 1 think they all agree about
that

"And yet don't like him. That is
rather inconsistent. And what about
yourself, Rachel ? If it is not a rude
question  are you an exception in this
respect, or not?"

He had taken his hands from her
shoulders, and was standing sideways
in the embrasure of the window, so
that he could see her face ; and he
was smiling in a most unpleasant
manner.

Rachel had never seen him like this
before, and the first seed of active
dislike was sown where as yet there
had been nothing worse than indifference.
The familiar colour rose and
flooded her white brow and her whiter

throat. She clenched her hands to still
the flutter of her heart. She shut her
teeth and struggled in silence against
an ignominious impulse to cry.

But Mr. Kingston continued to watch
her with that sardonic curiosity ; and
presently, like the traditional worm, she
turned on him.

Yes," she said, " I am an exception.
I like Mr. Dalrymple very much  what
little I know of him. I have seen no
reason to do otherwise. I do not pay
any attention to vulgar gossip."

A timid woman, trying to be defiant,
generally fails by overdoing it; and so
did she, poor child. Mr. Kingston heard
the emphasis of strong emotion, that
she would have given worlds to keep
back, vibrating through her tremulous
accents, and it drove him beyond those

considerations of policy and politeness
which he made a boast of as his rule
of Hfe and action  especially in his
dealings with women. Rachel, however,
in the category of women, was exceptionally
placed with respect to him ; and
I suppose one must do him the justice
to concede that this was an exceptional
emergency.

'TU tell you what," he said,
smiling no longer, and speaking with
a rough edge to his voice that betokened
the original rude nature,
usually so carefully clothed, and that
she instinctively resented as an indignity,
" Thornley can do as he likes
about the people he brings here to
associate with his wife, but I won't
have you making acquaintance with a
vagabond like that."

VOL. II. 22

I have already made his acquaintance,"
she said quietly.

Then I beg you will break it
off."

How can I break it off while he
is in the same house with me ?"

She was surprised to find how
strong she was to withstand this
incipient tyranny ; and yet her heart
contra-acted with a pain very like despair.


There will be so many people
that one  and he a man  may be
easily avoided, if you wish to avoid.
And you vill wish to do what would
please me, wouldn't you, dear ?" he
demanded, perceiving that he was
bullying her, and trying to correct
himself.

*' Yes," she replied ; " certainly. But

I hope you will not ask me to be
rude to one of my cousin's guests. I
don't mind what else I do to please
you. And when I am married, I will
of course know nobody but the people
you like."

'' You are as good as married tome
already' he said, putting his arm
round her shoulder as she stood before
him, with all sorts of changes
and revolutions going on within her.
And of course I don't want you to
be rude  I don't want you to be
anything. Simply don't take any notice
of Dalrymple he will quite understand
it ; don't dance with him, or have anything
to do with him."

Not dance with him !" she broke
out sharply.

Her evident dismay and disappointed



ment, together with her unconscious
efforts to evade his embrace, exasperated
his already ruffled temper
afresh.

Certainly not," he said, with angry
vehemence. "I shall be exceedingly annoyed
and vexed if I see you dancing
with that man."

Each el did not know until now
how much she had secretly set her
heart upon doing this forbidden thing ;
as her exigent lover did not know
until now that he had it in him to be
so horribly jealous.

He will be sure to come and ask
me," she said, with a despairing
sigh.

Very well. If he does, I beg you
will refuse him."

"Then I must refuse everybody."

Not at all. He will quite understand
that there are reasons why he
should be exceptionally treated."

And do you think I will make
him understand that V she burst outwith
pathetic indignation that filled
her soft eyes with tears. " Do you
think I would be so  so infamously
rude and cruel ? Oh, Mr. Kingston "
she never called him '' Graham "
except in her letters, though he tried
his best to make her  '' you don't
want to spoil all my pleasure to-night,
which was going to be such a happy
night ?"

Your pleasure doesn't depend on
dancing with Mr. Dalrymple, I Ao/e."

*'No no; but may I not treat him
like all the rest, for Lucilla's sake 
for common politeness' sake ?"

No, Rachel. I don't want to be
unkind, my dear, but you must remember
your position, and that now
you belong to me. A lady who understands
these matters can quite easily
manage to get off dancing with a
man if she wishes, without being rude.
You must learn those little social
accomplishments, and this is a very
good time to begin. Now let us
change the subject. Kiss me, and
don't look so miserable, or I shall
begin to * think  but that it would
be insulting you too much  that you
have fallen in love with this disreputable
ruffian."

Mr. Kingston tried to assume a
light and airy manner, but his badinage
had a menacing tone that was very
chilling.

Rachel, strange to say, did not
blush at all ; she quietly excused herself
on the plea that she must go
and arrange her dishevelled costume,
and (having no private bedroom tonight)
went a long way down the
garden to a retired harbour for half
an hour's meditation.

'WHEEE THERE WAS NEVER NEED OE Vows."

HEN Rachel came back to the
house it was nearly five
o'clock.

There was to be a great high tea
at six, for which no dressing was
required, in place of the ordinary
dinner ; and as she did not feel
inclined to meet the crowd of company
that was assembling in the 
sooner than was necessary
to tell the truth, she had been

crying, and her eyes were red
she returned by a back way
to the ball-room, which she knew
would be to all intents and purposes,
empty.

As an excuse for doing so she
carried in her arms some long wreaths
of spire which she had discovered
on a bush at the bottom of the
garden, with which she intended to
relieve the masses of box and laurentius
that made the groundwork of
her decorations.

Lightly flitting up a stone-flagged
passage at the rear of the house, she
suddenly came upon Mr. Dalrymple.
He emerged from the door of the
laundry, which had been assigned to
him for sleeping quarters, just as she
was passing it.

A MERE CHANCE,

Oil !" she cried sharply, as if lie
had been a ghost ; and then she
caught her breath, and dropped her
eyes, and blushed her deepest blush,
which was by no means the conventional
mode of salutation, but more
than satisfied the man who did not
know until this moment how eagerly
he had looked for a welcome from
her.

'' How do you do ?" he said, clothing
the common formula with a new
significance, and holding her hand ina
strong grasp ; "I was wondering
where you were, and beginning to
dread all kinds of disasters. Where
are you going ? May I carry these
for you ?"

He saw by this time the traces of
her recent tears, and the cheerful

cordiality of his greeting subsided to a
rather stern but very tender earnestness.


Silently he lifted the white wreaths
from her arm, and began to saunter
beside her in the direction of the
ball-room, much as he had led her
away into the conservatory on that
memorable night, which was only a
week, but seemed a year ago.

All the time she was thinking of
Mr. Kingston's prohibition, and dutifully
desiring to obey him ; but she
had no power in her to do
more.

They passed through the servants'
offices, meeting only Lucilla's maid,
who was in a ferment of excitement
with so many ladies to attend to, and
had not a glance to spare for them ;

the J heard voices and footsteps all
around them as they entered the
house ; but they reached the ballroom
unperceived and unmolested, and
found themselves alone.

The great room, with its windows
draped and garlanded, was dim and
silent ; the gardener's steps stood in
the middle ready for the lighting of
the lamps ; nothing but this remained
to be done, and no one came in to
disturb them.

For ten minutes they devoted themselves
to business. Mr. Dalrymple
mounted the steps, and wove the
spiraea into whatever green clusters
looked too thin or too dark ; he
touched up certain devices that seemed
to him to lack stability ; he straightened
some flags that were hanging

awry ; and Rachel stood below and
offered humble suggestions.

When they had done, and had
picked up a few fallen leaves and
petals, they stood and looked round
them to judge of the general effect.

It is very pretty," said Mr.
Dalrymple ; " and it makes a capital
ball-room. I have not seen a better
floor anywhere."

'' It was laid down on purpose for
dancing," said Rachel, who knew she
ought now to be making her appearance
elsewhere, yet lingered because
he did.

'' Are you fond of dancing ?" he
asked abruptly.

Yes," she said ; " very."

'' Will you give me your first waltz
to-night ?"

He was leaning an elbow on the
piano, near which lie stood, and looking
down on her with that gentle
but imperious inquiry in his eyes,
which made her feel as if she had
taken a solemn affidavit to tell the
truth.

I I cannot," she stammered, after
a pause, during which she wondered
distractedly how she could best explain
her refusal so as to spare him
unnecessary pain ; "I am very sorry
I would, with pleasure, if I
could."

Thank you," he said, with a slight,
grateful bow. " Well, I could hardly
hope for the first, I suppose. But I
may have the second ? Here are the
programmes," he added, fishing into a
basketful of them that stood on the

piano, and drawing two out ; " let
me put my name down for the
second, and what more you can spare;
may I ?"

She took the card he gave her,
opened it, looked at the little spaces
which symbolised so much more than
their own blank emptiness, looked up
at him, and then  alas ! She was a
timid, tender, weakly creature when
she was hurt, and she had not yet
got over the effect of Mr. Kingston's
harshness ; and she had been crying
too recently to be able to withstand
the slightest provocation to
cry.

She tried to speak, but her lip
quivered, and a tear that had been
slowly gathering fell with an audible
pat upon the piano. He drew the

card from lier in a moment, and
at the same time swept away any
veil of decorous reticence that she
might have wished to keep about
her.

What is the matter ?" he asked,
with gentle entreaty, which in him
was not inconsistent with a most
evident determination to find out. " I
am not distressing you, asking you to
dance with me, am I ?"

Oh, no  it is nothing ! Only
please done ask me," she almost
sobbed, struggling against the shame
that she was bringing on herself, and
knowing quite well that she would
struggle in vain.

He watched her in silence for half
a minute  not as Mr. Kingston had
watched her, though with even a

fiercer attentiveness, and then he said,
very quietly,

Why ?"

But he had already guessed.

Because  because  I have promised
not to."

You have promised Mr. Kingston
?"

Scarlet with pain and mortification,
in an agony of embarrassment, she
sighed almost inaudibly,

Yes." 

'' Not to dance with me ? or merely
not to dance waltzes ?"

'' Must I tell you ?" she pleaded,
looking up with appealing wet eyes
into his hard and haughty face.

'' Not unless you like. Miss Fathers
I think I understand perfectly."


VOL. II. 23

A MERE CHANCE.

Oil, Mr. Dalrymple, I want to tell
you about it, but I cannot. I am saying
things already that I ought not to
speak of."

I don't think so," he replied
quickly, suddenly softening until his
voice was almost a caress, and set all
her sensitive nerves thrilling like an
soliman harp when a strong wind
blows over it. 'rit is Id your nature
to be honest, and to tell the truth.
You are not afraid to tell the truth
to me?"

I would not tell you an untruth,"
she murmured, looking down; "but
the truth  sometimes one must, sometimes
one ought  to hide it. And I
hoped you would not need to know
about this."

Why, how could I help knowing

it ? Did you think it likely I might
by chance forget you were in the ballroom
to-night ?"

What she thought clearly " blazed
itself in the heart's colours on her
simple face." But she did not lift her
eyes or speak.

I am very glad I know," he continued,
in a rather stern tone. " If
you had done this to me, and never
told me why "

I should have trusted to you to
guess that it was not my fault, and
to forgive me for it," the girl interposed,
looking up at last with a
flash in her soft eyes that, as well
as her words, told him a great deal
more than she had any idea
of.

It was really so ?" he demanded

232

eagerly. '' It was not your own desire
to disappoint me so terribly?"

'' Oh, no:'

If you had been left to yourself
you would have danced with
me ?'

Yes, of course."

Quite willingly ?"

'' You Jcnoiv I would !"

Mr. Dalrymple drew a long breath.
It was rather a critical moment.
But he was no boy, at the mercy
of the wind and waves of his own
emotions, and Rachel's evident weakness
of self-control was an appeal
to his strength that he was not the
man to disregard. Still it was wonderful
how actively during these last
few minutes he had come to hate
Mr. Kingston, whom he had never seen.

I suppose," ho said presently, " I
must not ask the reason for this preposterous
proceeding ?"

Do not," she pleaded gently.
'' There is no reason, really. It is but
Mr. Kingston's whim."

'' And are you determined to sacrifice
me to Mr. Kingston's whim ?"

She did not speak, and he repeated
his query in a more imperious
fashion.

Are you really going to throw
me over altogether. Miss Fathers
? I only want to know."

She looked up at him piteously, and
he softened at once.

Tell me what I am to do," he
said, in a low voice. ' Do you wish
me not to ask you for any dances ?
It is a horrible thing  it is enough

to make me wish I had gone to
Queensland on Monday, after all  but
I will not bother you. Tell me, am I
not to ask you at all ?"

If you please," she whispered
with a quick sigh, full of despairing
resignation. " I am very sorry, but it
is right to do what Mr. Kingston wishes."

That is not my view in this
case. However, it is right for me
to do what you wish. And I will,
though it is very hard."

Here Rachel, feeling all her body
like one great beating heart, moved
away to the door, driven by a stern
sense of social duty.

Her companion did not follow her,
and she paused on the threshold,
turned round, and then suddenly
hurried back to him.

*' Mr. Dalrymple," she said, putting
out her hand with an impulsive
gesture, " do not wish you had gone
to Queensland instead of coming here
to-night. If you do I shall be 'miserable /"

He seized her hand immediately, and
stooping his tall head at the same
moment, brushed it - with his moustache.
Then, looking up into her scared face,
he said  like a man binding himself by
some terrible oath :

That I never will."

Once before in that room they had
touched the point where not only mere
acquaintance but warmest friendship
ends. Then it had been to her a new,
incomprehensible experience ; now she
could not help seeing the reason and
the meaning of it, though, perhaps, not
so clearly as he.

In a moment she lead drawn her
hand away, and like a bird frightened
from its nest, had vanished out of his
sight, leaving him  thoroughly aroused
from his normal impassiveness  gazing
at the empty doorway behind her.

When they met again, ten minutes
afterwards, it was in the drawing-room,
which was crowded with people; and
through all the crush and noise, she
was as acutely conscious of his presence
as if he alone had been there.

She moved about with tremulous restlessness
and downcast eyes ; afraid to
look at him  afraid he should look at
her; paying her little civilities mechanically,
and conducting herself generally,
to her aunt's extreme annoyance, more
like a bashful schoolgirl and a poor
relation than ever.

Mr. Kingston, doing his best to fascinate
Miss Hale, who stood beside
him, giggling and simpering and twiddling
her watch-chain, looked anxiously
at his little sweetheart when she entered,
thought he saw signs of his own
handiwork in her disturbed and downcast
face, called her to him, and until
the great tea-dinner was over, and they
all had to disperse to dress, compassed
her with devout attentions, intended to
assure her of his royal forgiveness and
favour.

But he did not remove the prohibition,
which made her more and more
resentful as she continued to think
about it, and less and less responsive
to his ostentatious " kindness ;" and he
treated Mr. Dalrymple  when he condescended
to acknowledge his presence

at all  with a supercilious rudeness
that Mr. Thornley, in conjugal confidence,
declared to be '' very bad form,"
and that prompted the gentle Lucilla
to be " nicer " to the younger man than
Rachel had ever seen her. He was
so open in his hostility that it
was generally noticed and talked of
(and the cause of it more or less
correctly surmised).

The only person who seemed absolutely
indifferent to it and to him was Mr.
Dalrymple himself ; and in his secret
heart he was much more glad than
angry to have earned such pronounced
dislike from such a quarter, though as
impatient of what he called '' impudence"
as anybody.

That Adelonga ball was a memorable
event to most of the people that it

gathered together  as what ball is not ?
Mr. Thornley celebrated the coming of
age of his son and heir, to begin with.
Mrs. Thornley appeared for the first
time, 'officially," after the birth of her
baby, who was the hero of all occasions
to her, and inaugurated a great " county"
reputation as a charming hostess and
woman.

Mrs. Hardy got her best point lace
irretrievably ruined by catching it on
an unprotected corner of the wire-netting
upon which Rachel had worked
her decorations ; and she also saw the
lamentable frustration of several wise
plans that she had made.

Two young people became engaged;
others, male and female, fell in love,
or began those pleasant flirtations which
led to love eventually.

Miss Hale on the other hand, quarrelled
with Mr. Lessel, who took upon
himself to object to her extravagant
appreciation of Mr. Kingston's rather
extravagant attentions ; and their engagement
was broken off.

Mr. Lessel at the same time captivated
the fancy of a charming young
lady, only daughter of the Adelonga
family doctor, resident in the township
close by, who was destined in less
than twelve months to be his
wife.

Mr. Kingston, surfeited with balls,
had a deeper interest in this one than
in any of the hundreds that he had
attended in the course of a long and gay
career.

Never before had he admired a pretty
woman with such ferocious sincerity ashe

admired his little Rachel to-night ;
never before had he used such rude
tactics to make the object of his affections
jealous  thereby to subdue rebellion
in her; never before had he been so
defied and circumvented by a being in
female shape as he was to-night by this
presumptive little nobody, whom he bad
singled out for honour, and who was
bound to honour him, and his lightest
wish.

As for Mr. Dalrymple and Rachel 
they must be classed together in this
catalogue of special experiences, for they
shared theirs between them  the Adelonga
ball marked a new and very memorable
departure in the history of their lives.
For half the evening they danced
decorously apart.

Mr. Dalrymple justified Mrs. Thornley's

expectations, of course, and distinguished
himself above all the dancing men assembled
; Rachel, who had had but
little teaching, was a dancer by nature
and instinct, as light and effortless, as
airy and graceful as a bit of windblown
thistle-down.

She loved it, as she loved all pleasant
and poetic things ; and though she could
not have the partner she wanted, and
had to take whom she could get, she
felt to-night, and more and more as
the evening wore away, that she had
never heard and felt, in the strains of
mere senseless instruments and in the
thrill of responsive pulses, music of
mundane waltzes and galops of such
inspired and impassioned beauty.

There was a young artist from Melbourne
who played lovely airs on a

violin to a piano accompaniment, and
he seemed literally to play upon her,
spiritually sensitive as she was to-night
to the lightest touch of that divine
afflatus which makes poetry of certain
passages in the most prosaic lives.

Now rapturously happy, now tragically
miserable, and tremulously fluctuating
up and down between these two
extremes, she was blown about like
a leaf in autumn wind by the subtle
harmonies of that magical violin. At
least she thought it was the violin.
We know better.

At about twelve o'clock she went into
the house on an errand for Lucilla,
and came back by way of the conservatory,
as the first bars of a
Strauss waltz were stealing through
the fern-roofed alleys, with nameless

tender associations in every liquid
note.

For a few seconds she paused in
the shadowy doorway, a slight, white
figure against the dim background, with
hair like a golden aureola, and milk-white
neck and arms  a gracious vision
of youth and beauty as prince could
wish to see.

But the Sleeping Princess now was
acutely wide awake ; the life that ran
in her quickened pulses was almost
more than she could bear. Her eyes
shone restlessly, her breath fluttered
in her throat, her heart ached and
swelled with some vague, irresistible
passion, as the waves of that delicious
melody flowed over her, like an enchanter's
incantation.

A few paces off, within the ball-room,

Mr. Dalrymple stood with his back to
the wall watching her; his dark face
was lit and transfigured with the same
kind of solemn exaltation. She turned
her head, and they looked at one
another, mutually conscious of the
supreme moment that had unawares
arrived.

He held out his . hand  she almost
sprang to meet him ; and then, oblivious
of betrothals, and promises, and houses,
and diamonds, she floated down the
long room, under the very noses of
her aunt and Mr. Kingston, lying ina
reckless ecstasy of contentment in
her true love's arms.

VOL. II. 24

AFTER THE BALL.

Whatever might have been
Rachel's confusion of mind as
to the nature and consequences
of her escapade, Mr. Dalrymple, from
the moment that he took her in his
arms, understood the situation perfectly.
It was sufficiently serious to a man in
his position, who, whatever his faults,
was the soul of honour; but it was
never his way to dally with difficulties,
and he left himself in no sort of

suspense or uncertainty as to how he
would deal with this one.

Whether right or wrong, whether
wise or foolish, in any sudden crisis
requiring sudden choice of action, he
obeyed his natural impulse, subject
to his own rough code of duty only,
without an instant's hesitation, and
followed it up with unswerving determination,
totally unembarrassed by any
anxiety as to where it might lead or
what it might cost him, or as to
any ultimate consequences that might
ensue.

In nine cases out of ten a man of
honour, placed as he was now, would
have regretted an unconsidered act of
folly, and have cast about for means
of extricating himself and the girl who
was behaving badly to her affianced

2i 2

husband from the position into which
it had led them  even, perhaps, to
the extent o using

Some rough discourtesy
To blunt or break her passion."

But he was the one man in ten who,
equally a man of honour, felt himself
under no obligation to do anything of
the kind. If she loved him  and now
he knew she did ; if he loved her, or
was able to love her  and he allowed
himself no doubt upon that point
from this moment of her self-revelation,
though he had not meant to permit
anybody (least of all a mere child like
this) to supplant the dead woman on
whom the passion of his best years
had been spent  then the thing was
settled. They might waltz together till

daylight, and no one would have any
right to interfere.

The social complications that surrounded
them, and which a conventional
gentleman would have considered
of the last importance, were
to him mere matters of detail. They
must manage to get out of them as
best they could.

So he carried her round and round
the room, the most perfect partner
he had ever danced with, who moved
so sympathetically with all his movements
that she might have been his
shadow  but for the electric current
of strong life that her hand in his,
and her light weight on his shoulder,
and the subtle sense of her emotion,
sent thrilling through his veins ; and
in the teeming silence his brain was

busy making rapid plans and calculations
for effectively dealing with the many
difficulties that would come crowding
upon both of them as soon as this
waltz was over.

Clearly, the first thing to do was
to dispose of ambiguities between
themselves.

Come into the conservatory," he
said, in a quick under tone, when five
silent, delicious minutes had passed;
I want to say something to you
before these people begin to spread
all over the place again."

But even as he spoke, as if a spell
had been broken, the light and rapture
died suddenly out of her face, her
limbs relaxed, her airy footsteps faltered,
she seemed to melt away in his
arms.

'' Oh," she whispered, looking up
at him with tragic eyes, full of fear
and despair, '' how wicked I have been !
What till he say to me ?"

"Never mind /im," replied Mr.
Dalrymple ; " you must not let him
have any right to dictate to you anymore
 you must break off your engagement
at once, and get out of his
hands. Wicked !  the only wicked
thing would be to deceive him any
longer. You hioiu you don't love him.
Come into the conservatory, and let us
talk about it. Do come  there is nobody
there now !'*

But Rachel, being a woman, and a
coward, and only eighteen years old,
would not come. She knew what she
wanted, but she dared not do it  she
dared not even think of it.

"I must not  I must not!" she
protested, in a childish panic of terror.
'' Let me go, Mr. Dalrymple, please 
I have done very wrong  I am afraid
to stay "

And slipping out of his arms, which
did the utmost that courtesy permitted
to hold her, she fled through a doorway
near and disappeared ; and thus
threw away an opportunity the loss of
which was to cost them both long
days and nights of suspense and
suffering  as she foresaw with agonies
of regret, even while she did it.

Mr. Dalrymple danced and talked,
and sauntered about, proud and cool
as usual to the superficial observer,
but raging with impatience in his
heart, and watched for her return;
but he saw her no more until supper

time, when she was led into the
dining-room, looking very pale and
quiet, on Mr. Kingston's arm.

The whole night passed, and he
never had a chance to get near her
again ; though as may be supposed, it
was from no lack of effort on his
part ; and he went to the laundry at
last, hours after she had gone to bed,
to change his clothes preparatory to
taking a morning walk up the hills,
without even having had the satisfaction
of one look from her eyes,
which, however timid and terrified,
he felt sure would have told him the
truth.

She did not come into the drawing-room
before breakfast ; and at that
irregularly conducted meal she sat
again by Mr. Kingston's side, the

whole table's length from him. But
glancing round her as she took her
seat, she met his fixed gaze, and
bowed with a subtle, wistful impressiveness
that reassured him completely
as to the state of her mind towards
him, let her outward actions be what
they might.

It was very tantalising; all his
habitual calmness was upset ; his very
hand trembled as he took his coffee
from Lucilla, and once when his
gentle hostess spoke to him, he did
not hear her.

The fret of this state of things,
it is needless to say, chafed his
incipient passion into flame ; and the
flame was kept up thereafter, at a
more or less fierce heat and brightness,
by the winds of adversity that

ought to  and in nine cases out often
would  bave put it out.

After breakfast the company began
to disperse in a desultory manner
by instalments. Some of the guests
lingered until the afternoon ; some until
the next day.

The Digbys were the first to leave
partly because they had so far to
go, partly because Mrs. Digby was
anxious about her children  and of
course Mr. Dalrymple had to go with
them.

He hunted in vain for Rachel when
the breakfast party broke up. She
kneiv he was hunting for her, and she
longed to go to him, and therefore
as a matter of course, she hid
herself.

Only at the last moment, as he

was about to ride gloomily away, she
appeared on the threshold of one of
the inferior front doors, pale and
shrinking, but desperate with vague
despair  thinking to solace herself with
one more glimpse of him when he
would not know she was looking.
But he saw her in a moment, flung
himself from Lucifer's back, and
caught her before she could steal away
again.

It was not the sort of farewell he
had hoped for  several of the ladies
came straggling about them before
they could exchange half a dozen words
but it was infinitely better than
none.

Are you going to Queensland ?"
Rachel asked, in a tone which said plainly
" Are you going away from me ?"

I must go," he replied ; '' but I
shall not stay  I shall come back as
quickly as possible. And you  what
will you do ?"

She flushed scarlet and dropped her
eyes, and her lips began to quiver.
The rustle of Mrs. Hardy's majestic
skirts was heard approaching. It was
too late for confidences.

I hope, when I come back, I shall
find you free," he whispered hurriedly,
emphasising the significance of the
words with the crushing clasp of his
hand over hers and the eager desire in
his eyes ; and then he took off his cap,
included all the ladies in one last
silent adieu, remounted his horse, and
departed.

As he rode through the bush this
lovely spring morning, near enough to

the waggonette to open the gates for it,
but far enough away to indulge in his
meditations undisturbed, he pondered
many things; and particularly he
wondered, with a devouring anxiety,
what Rachel had been doing and thinking
of since she left him so abruptly
at midnight, after practically giving herself
to him.

If he could have known it is doubtful
if he would have felt so certain
of her as he was, though nothing would
have deterred him now from making
the best fight in his power for the
possession of her.

When, in terror of the consequences
of what she had done, she broke
away from him and escaped out of
the ball-room, she rushed to her own
room, forgetting until she dashed into

the middle of an untidy litter of open
boxes and portmanteaus which Miss
Hale had left on the floor, that it was
not hers to-night ; and then she turned
and sped down one of the innumerable
passages into the quiet starlight outside,
and sought refuge in that lonely arbour
at the bottom of the garden, which
already, not many hours before, had
given sanctuary to these new emotions.

That she courted bronchitis and
consumption, exposing her bare warm
arms and bosom to the chill of a frosty
night, was a trivial circumstance quite
unworthy of consideration.

In this arbour she abandoned herself
to the full luxury of that passion
which was neither joy nor grief, and
yet had the pain and ecstasy of both
in the sharpest degree.

She knelt on the damp floor,
and leaned her arms on the dusty
bench, regardless of panic-stricken
ants and enterprising black beetles,
and she shook from head to foot with
sobs.

Oh my love !" she murmured to
herself. " Oh, my love !"

And then presently lifting herself up
and appealing to the star-worlds faraway,
and the immutable universe in
general :

"Oh, what shall I do? Oh, what
can I do ?"

By and bye she sat down on the
bench, clasped her hands on her
knees, and tried her best to * compose
herself.

The keen air made her shiver,
and perhaps it did something to cool

her agitation and brace her nerves as
well.

Slowly she gathered her wits together,
made tremulous efforts to
school herself to be womanly and
courageous, and at last crept back
to the lighted and crowded house,
hugging a brave but terrible resolution.


She went to the nearest fire to
warm herself. It was in a little room
adjoining the dining-room, where the
last preparations for supper were going
on.

As she knelt on the hearthrug,
extending her white arms to the
blaze, Mr. Kingston came behind her
and laid his hands on her shoulders, so
silently and unexpectedly that she gave
a little startled cry.

VOL. II. 25

Did I frighten you, my pet ?'*
said lie, daily ; ''I beg your pardon.
I couldn't think where you were
gone to. I am afraid you are tired.
You have been waltzing too much.
That fellow Dalrymple does go round
at a killing pace with his long legs.
Poor Miss Hale couldn't stand him
at all  she nearly fainted. Ah, naughty
child ! Didn't I tell you not to dance
with him ? And you never paid the
least heed ! If this is how you defy
me now, what am I to expect after
we are married, eh ?"

She looked up in his face with
guilty, bewildered eyes. He was not
by any means so cool as he assumed
to be, but it was evident that
he intended to ignore her offence,
and was not going to scold her.

He was  not young and rash, if
she was ; and the few minutes he
had taken for reflection, during her
absence in the garden, had shown
him where the path of wisdom lay.
Her first sensation was one of extreme
relief ; and then she became slowly
conscious of a vague sinking at her
heart.

Once more she sighed to herself 
feeling discouraged and overpowered,
and unequal to the formidable vastness
of her resolution  '' Oh, what shall
I do ?"

It would have been much better
much easier  if he had scolded
her.

Before the revels of the night were
quite over, Mrs. Hardy sent her to
bed, noticing that she was looking

25  2

unusually quiet and pale. She was
very glad to go, and made haste to
hide herself in the little impromptu
nest that had been prepared for heron
a couch in her aunt's room, before
that lady should require the use of
her apartment.

She was wide awake, however, when
Mrs. Hardy joined her, and too restless
to disguise it ; and the elder
woman, who knew nothing of the
girl's entanglements with her two
lovers  who had, indeed, congratulated
herself on the prudent abstinence
which had been unexpectedly practised
with reference to " that objectionable
young man " who was such a dangerously
delightful dancer  gossiped and
grumbled over the little events of the
evening, chiefly of the accident to her

lace and the absurdities of Miss Hale
and Mr. Lessel, who were publicly
known to have had a serious misunderstanding,
unaware of her listener's
pre-occupation, until the candles were
finally extinguished.

About an hour later, as she was
anxiously cogitating what steps she
should take towards the repairing of
her own mishap, Mrs. Hardy thought
she heard a suspicious sound in the
silence of the room.

Rachel," she called, softly ; " is
that you, child ?"

No answer. Only a rustle of drapery,
indicating that Rachel had turned over
in her bed. She listened a few
minutes, and the suspicious sound
was repeated. Raising herself on her
elbow, she called more loudly.

You are not crying, Rachel, are
you ?"

The girl flung herself out of bed,
ran across the room, a little white
ghost in the faint dawn, and threw
her arms round her aunt's neck. She
had no mother, poor little thing, to
tell her troubles to ; and she wanted
a mother now.

Oh, dear aunt Elizabeth," she
sobbed passionately, *' do help me  I
am so miserable ! I don't want to
marry Mr. Kingston ! I don't love
him  I have made a mistake ! I didn't
think enough about it, and now I
know we should never suit each
other. Won't you tell him I was too
young, and that I made a mistake ?
Won't you  oh, please do !  help me
to break it off?"

On what a mere chance does destiny
depend.

If Mrs. Hardy's evening had been
triumphant and prosperous  if she had
not torn her best lace, and torn it inconsequence
of Rachel's carelessness 
she would probably have received the
girls touching confidence as a tender
mother should. As it was, she felt that
after all her fatigues and worries, this
was really too much.

What nonsense are you talking,
child?" she exclaimed angrily. 'ris it
any fault of Mr. Kingston's if Miss
Hale behaves like an idiot ? She is
nothing but a vulgar flirt, and he
knows it as well as you do  only
it is his way to be attentive to all
women."

' Miss Hale !" repeated Rachel vaguely ;

'' I'm not thinking of Miss Hale.
I am not blaming anybody  only myself.
I was very wrong to accept Mr.
Kingston at the first  oh, aunt, you
know we are not suited to each other !
He ought to marry somebody older and
grander, and I  I thought I should
like to be rich, and to live in that
house  and I thought I should come to
love him in time; but now I know it
was all a mistake. Do  do let me
break it off before it goes any further !
Let me stay with you  I shall be qidte
happy to stay with you and Uncle
Hardy, if you'll only let me ! "

'' You are dreaming," replied her
aunt, giving her a slight shake in the
extremity of her dismay and mortification;
'you talk like a baby. Do you
think a man is to be taken up one day

and thrown away the next ? And it is
worse than that to jilt a man  and Mr.
Kingston of all people  after being
engaged to him for months, as you
have been, and after leading him into
all sorts of preparations and expense.
The bare idea is monstrous ! And all
for nothing at all, but some ridiculous
sudden fancy ! You may have seen
things of that sort done amongst the
people you have been brought up
with, but no lachj would think of
disgracing herself and her family by
such conduct."

Oh, aunt ! " moaned E-achel piteously,
as if she had had an unexpected
blow.

"I don't like to speak harshly to
you, my dear," Mrs. Hardy proceeded,
in a rather more gentle, but still irritated

tone. " Only you must not vex
me with such absurd and childish
notions. I know it is only a passing
whim  you are over-tired, and you are
hurt because Mr. Kingston paid Miss
Hale so much attention, though it is
only what he does to all women, without
meaning anything whatever; but still
it is a serious and horrible thing 
breaking an engagement, a really happy
engagement, as yours is  jilting a kind,
good man, after giving him every
encouragement  even to think of ! Don't
let me hear you mention it again,
unless you want to break my heart
altogether. And after all I have done
for you  I don't want to boast, but I
have been a good aunt to you, Rachel,
and you would have been in a poor
place but for me  the least you can dois

to respect my wishes, especially as
you know I wish nothing but what is
for your real good and welfare."

Rachel wandered back to her bed,
laid her head gently on the pillow, and
closed her eyes. Mrs. Hardy in the
dead silence that presently ensued, was
relieved to think that she had " settled
off" at last; but it was not sleep that
kept her so quiet  it was the calmness
of defeat and despair.

RACHEL S EIEST VISIT IN Melbourne.

N the last week of August,
when the place was looking
its loveliest  the rustic gables
of the pretty house all hung with
wistaria, and the shrubberies full of
fragrant bushes of purple and white
lilac  Mrs. Hardy, Mr. Kingston, and
Rachel took their departure from Aden
It was to one of them a truly
heart-breaking business.

Rachel stood on the verandah while

the horses were being put to, clasping
Lucilla and the baby alternately to her
heart, and wept without restraint, until
her eyes were swollen, and her delicate
colour resolved into unbecoming
red patches, and there was scarcely a
trace of her beauty and brightness
left.

No one but herself was at all able
to realise what this moment cost her.
She was not only leaving a place where
she had spent the happiest period of
her youth ; not only parting from
friends with whom she had established
the most tender and sympathetic relations;
she was closing a chapter, or
rather a brief passage, which was the
one inspired poem of her life ; and she
was saying good-bye to Hope.

As long as she was at Adelonga,

there was the chance that Mr. Dalrymple
might come back  at any rate, notwithstanding
the Queensland arrangements,
there was a constant impression that
he was near. And as long as she was
at Adelonga she had felt bold to strive,
by various feeble and ineffectual devices,
to extricate herself from her engagement.


Now she was going where it seemed
to her her lover would never be allowed
to reach her, and where in a hard
world of money and fashion, and under
the terrible dominion of " the house,"
she would be a helpless victim in the-hands
of Fate.

"Good-bye, darling Lucilla!" she
sobbed ; '' thank you so much  I have
been so happy here  I am so sorry to
go away !"

The gentle woman was inexpressibly
touched, and of course cried for company.
Mrs. Hardy had her own maternal
reluctance to face an indefinite term of
separation from her daughter. And
altogether Mr. Kingston was not without
justification for his unusually irritable
frame of mind.

He did not like to see women crying ;
he was particularly annoyed that Rachel
should exercise so little command over
herself, and that she should have red
eyes and a swollen nose ; and he was
uneasy about the untoward episode
which had been the first hitch in the
smooth current of his engagement, and
wondered whether it could be possible
that a lingering fancy for that Dalrymple
fellow was making her so unwilling to
return to her Melbourne life.

Moreover, he hated country travelling
long drives over rough bush roads,
and bivouacs at country inns, where the
food was badly cooked and the wine
detestable ; and he was suspicious about
the behaviour of the Adelonga horses,
whose little traits of character came
out rather strongly in the invigorating
air of spring; and he had a nasty
touch of gout.

However, the day was fine, and the
drive was lovely. As she was carried
along, with the soft air blowing in her
face, full of the delicious fragrance of
golden wattle, Rachel ceased to cry 
becoming calm, and pensive, and pretty
again  and took to meditation; wondering,
for the most part, what Queensland
was like, and how it was she
could ever have thought Melbourne, asa

place of residence, preferable to the
bush.

They passed a charming little farmhouse,
more picturesque in the simple
elegance of its slab walls and brown
bark roof than any Toorak villa of
them all, set in its little patch of
garden, with fields of young green corn
and potatoes, neatly fenced in, behind
it. It had its little rustic outbuildings,
its bright red cart in the shed,
its tidy strawyard, its cows and pigs
and poultry feeding in the bush close

by.

The farmer was working in his garden;
the farmer's wife, on her knees beside
him, was weeding and trimming the
borders of thyme that ringed the little
flower beds. They both paused to gaze
at the imposing equipage crashing

VOL. II. 26

along with its four strong horses, and
at the ladies and gentlemen perched so
high above them ; and Rachel, looking
down from her box-seat, thought she
had never seen such a picture of rural
and domestic peace. She had suddenly
ceased to regard material wealth and
splendour as in any way essential to
happiness.

To live in some such home as this
(provided one had enough to live on
and to pay one's way), working
with one's own hands for the man
one loved  that seemed to her at this
moment the ideal lot in life.

Having started from Adelonga an
hour before noon, the horses were taken
out at two o'clock to be fed and
watered, and the little party camped
beside a shady water-hole for lunch.

Lucilla had put up a bounteous
basket of good things, and all the
materials for afternoon tea ; and the
fun of arranging the grassy table first,
and of making a fire and boiling the
kettle afterwards  not to speak of the
very satisfactory meal that intervened
had its natural effect upon our impressionable
heroine of eighteen.

Her fiance, much revived by a tumbler
of dry champagne, carefully cooled in
the water-hole, was also in improved
spirits and temper, and he set himself
to be very kind to his little
sweetheart, and forgave, her all her misdeeds.


Between three and four, having had
their tea, the horses were put to, and
they started on their way again ; and
just at nightfall they arrived at the

262

railway, and at the inn where they were
to spend the night.

Here they found dinner awaiting them,
of which Rachel partook in sleepy
silence ; and she went to bed soon afterwards,
and slept too soundly even to
dream of trouble.

In the morning they parted from Mr.
Thornley, and started by the first train
to town ; at noon they lunched in a
railway refreshment-room ; and in the
middle of the afternoon they found themselves
once more in Toorak, being helped
out of the family brougham by good-natured
Ned, and welcomed into the
green satin drawing-room by his bright-faced
wife.

"And so you are back again at
last !" exclaimed Beatrice gaily, as she
took her young cousin into her arms.

And how are you, dear child ? Why
you look quite pale. Take off your hat
and sit down at once, and have some
tea. Mr. Kingston, I don't think this
country air that they talked so
much about has done anything very
wonderful after all. Rachel is not
looking so well as she was when she
left."

Rachel blushed a lovely rose-colour
immediately, of course, and Mr. Kingston
looked up at her with vague
anxiety.

"I don't think she is, myself," he
said ; " I noticed it as soon as I got up
there. But she will be all right now she
is home again."

I am only tired," murmured
Rachel.

A girl like you has no business to

be tired," retorted the little woman
brusquely.

It did not escape her sharp eyes
that something was the matter, and
she determined to take the earliest
opportunity to find out what it
was.

I do hope to goodness," she said
to herself, " that it is not her engagement
that she is tired of  and everything
going on so nicely !"

And then she took off Rachel's sealskin
cap and jacket, settled her by
the fireside, furnished her with a cup
of fragrant tea and some thin bread
and butter, and left her to herself
while she attended to her mother's
wants.

Beatrice and her tea had a generally
cheering and invigorating effect.

Mr. Kingston, making himself comfortable
in a very easy chair, grew
talkative and witty upon the news of
the day and the latest items of fashionable
gossip ; in the society of this
charming little woman of the world  his
world  the satisfaction of being in town
again began to creep over him pleasantly.


He stayed for half an hour  outstaying
Iste, who retired modestly at
the end of twenty minutes ; then
he led Rachel into the hall, kissed
her, told her to go to bed early
and come out with him for a ride
in the morning, and went off to
his club  sorry to leave his little
lady-love, but glad to be able to
get his letters, to hear what was
efoino on in Melbourne, and to read his

"Argus" on the day of publication
again.

After his departure Mrs. Hardy and
Beatrice plunged fathoms deep in talk.
Mrs. Hardy wanted to know how her
husband and her servants, and her
neighbours and her friends, had been
conducting themselves during her absence,
and Beatrice wanted minute particulars
about Lucilla and the baby.

Rachel had no occasion to feel herself
de trop ; at the same time she
saw she was not wanted. She sauntered
softly round the room, laid some
music scattered about over the piano
in a neat pile, re-arranged some yellow
pansies that were tumbling out of a
green Yallauris bowl, and then stole
noiselessly into the hall and out of the
house.

The grounds of the Hardy domain
were more beautiful with flowers
now than she had ever seen them;
but she did not stay amongst the
flowers. She went down little lonely
paths, intersecting vegetable beds
and forcing-frames, to a gate at
the bottom of the kitchen-garden,
where she was within speaking
distance of the workmen engaged
on the new house, with nothing
to impede a full view of their
operations.

She was feverishly anxious to know
how they were going on  whether they
were still '' pottering at the foundations,"
or whether the stage of walls had set
in.

The working day was not yet over,
and the well-known chinking and clinking

of the stonemason's implements smote
her ear. She thought, when she began
to count them, that there were a great
many more men than there used
to be, and she wondered why this
was.

The young man who was sent out by
the architects to supervise the builders,
and whose acquaintance she had made
with Mr. Kingston, was walking about
the dusty enclosure, and presently
recognising her, he lifted his hat,
and then seeing that she still lingered,
came up to the gate to speak
to her.

"How are you getting on, Mr. Moore?"
she asked pleasantly. " Are you still
doing the foundations ?"

Mr. Moore assured her that they
had completed the foundations, and

that they were getting on splendidly.


Won't you come out and have
a look at what has been done ?" he
inquired.

She thanked him and said she would ;
and he opened the gate with alacrity,
and escorted her through a labyrinth
of bricks and stones, over ground
strewn thickly with sharp-edged chips
that cut holes in her boots, very well
pleased to be the first to show her
the progress that had been made in her
absence.

She could see for herself that a great
deal had been done. The trenches were
filled up ; great square blocks of stone
ridged the outlines of the ground-floor
rooms  little bits of rooms they
looked, and not at all like the stately

and spacious apartments of the architect's
design; but it seemed to her that what
had been done could not be a tenth or
twentieth part of all that there was todo.


I suppose," she said, " it takes a
long time to build the walls and make
such a quantity of windows ?"

Oh, dear, no," responded Mr. Moore
cheerfully. "All the worst of the work
is over now, as far as the shell is
concerned ; the walls will run up in
no time. It is a big house, but there
are plenty of men on it, and all
materials ready. It is after the shell
is done that the real tedious work commences."


You mean after the roof is
on?"

Yes. The interior decorations are

the chief thing about this house. The
outside is not much."

When do you expect the shell will
be finished?" asked Rachel, in fear and
trembling.

Some time in the course of the 
the next two or three months
probably."

"And thereof on?"

"Oh, yes; of course the roof on," he
replied.

There was a pause ; and then she said
in a very small, thin voice :

"Thank you, Mr. Moore. I think I
must go back now."

He escorted her back to the garden
gate, lifted his hat, and bade her good
evening; and it struck him suddenly
with far more force than it had
struck Beatrice-that she was looking

A MERE CHANCE.

extremely unwell, and not at all like
the bright and blooming creature that
she was when she went away.

IX MES. Hardy's STOEE-EOOM.

ACHEL was very young, no
doubt, but she was growing
rapidly. To all intents and
purposes she was at least five years
older when she came home from
Adelonga than she was when she went
there ; and the process of development
by no means ceased or slackened at
that point.

The blossoming of her womanhood
had come suddenly, like the blossoming

of the almond trees, in one warm
burst of spring ; but the inner heart,
that budded in secret, continued to swell
and ripen, in spite of  perhaps because
of  the absence of sunshine in her
spiritual life.

The physical change in her was noticeable
to everybody. Her constitution
was much too sound to be easily
injured by mental wear and tear; but
her health was necessarily affected ina
greater or less degree, temporarily,
for the better or for the worse, by
the more powerful of those mental
emotions to which her body was
peculiarly sensitive and responsive at all
times.

So she lost some of her delicate
pinky colour, and her large eyes grew
heavy and dreamy, and she looked

generally faded and altered, in the
dulness of these empty days. She had
no more enthusiasm for Toorak life
and Melbourne dissipations. She went
into no raptures over jewels and
dresses, or any pretty things ; she had
none of the old zest for operas and
balls.

She was quiet, and silent, and preoccupied,
moving about the house with
a strange new dignity of manner
(resulting from the total absence of
self-consciousness), a sort of weary
tolerance, as if she had lived in it all
her life, and was tired of it.

After watching her for a few days,
secretly, and in much perplexed anxiety,
Mrs. Reade made up her mind that
something was seriously wrong, and
that it was time for her to interfere

YOL. II. 27

to set it right. Lie went to her
mother in the first place for information.


It was eleven o'clock in the morning,
and Mrs. Hardy was in her store-room,
counting out the day's allowance of
eggs to an aggrieved and majestic
cook.

The little woman stood by silently,
watching the transaction with a smile
in her brilliant eyes, thinking to herself
what a great mistake it was, if
poor mamma could but see it, to insist
on an inflexible morality and economy
in these petty matters ; and when it
was completed, after a little acrimonious
discussion, she quietly shut the door,
and addressed herself to her own business
in her customary straightforward
way.

'' I want to know what is the matter
with Rachel," she began, spreading
her handkerchief on a keg of vinegar,
and sitting down on it deliberately.

Mrs. Hardy mechanically sought repose
in the one chair of the apartment,
which stood in front of the little table
where she was in the habit of making
out her accounts.

I'm sure that is more than I can
tell you, my dear. What an insolent
woman that is !  if she thinks I am
going to let her have the run of my
stores, as Mrs. Robinson did, she is very
much mistaken."

Something is wrong with Rachel,"
proceeded Mrs. Reade calmly; 'rand I
want to find out what it is."

Mrs. Hardy made an effort to smooth
her rushed feathers down.

07 y.

'' I think the child must be fretting
for Lucilla and the baby, Beatrice. She
and Lucilla were bosom friends, and she
just went wild about the baby  it
was quite ridiculous to see her with
it. And when she left them she cried
as if she were completely heartbroken;
and she has never been like herself
since. I can't think what else ails her
unless she is out of sorts, and wants
some medicine. I did give her some
camomile yesterday, but it does not
seem to have done her any good."

'' No," said Mrs. Reade, with a sudden
smile, " I don't think it is a case for
camomile. She is not ill ; she is unhappy
 anyone can see that. You can
see it, can't you ?"

I'm sure no girl has less cause to
be unhappy," protested Mrs. Hardy

evasively, in a fretful and anxious tone.
"It is very ungrateful of lier if lie is."
But what can have caused it ? She
was all right when she went to Adelonga.
Something must have happened while
she was there. She is not merely
fretting after Lucilla and the baby 
oh, no, it is a deeper matter than
that. I am afraid  I really am seriously
afraid, by the look of things  that it
has something to do with Mr. Kingston."
Her mother, though silent, was so obtrusively
conscious and uneasy that she
felt assured, the moment that she looked
at her, of the correctness of her surmise.
'* Oh, do tell me what has happened!"
she continued, eagerly. " Something has,
I know. It is what I have been
dreading all along  with these tiresome
delays ! They ought to have been

married out of hand, and then there
would have been no trouble."

'' If there is anything wrong between
them," Mrs. Hardy reluctantly admitted,
'' it is  I must say that for Rachel,
though she is very trying with her
silly childishness  it is Mr. Kingston's
doings."

Of course," assented Mrs. Reade,
promptly.

It was on the night of the ball.
He rather neglected Rachel  the first
time I ever knew him to do it  and
he flirted in that foolish way of his
with Minnie Hale. You know Minnie
Hale?  a great, fat, giggling creature 
quite a common, vulgar sort of girl 
not in the least Ms sort, one would
have imagined. I don't wonder that
Rachel was offended; I was extremely

vexed with him myself, for he did it so
openly  everybody noticed it. It was
so bad, really, that the man that horrid
girl was engaged to, Mr. Vessel, broke
off with her on account of it. That
will show you. She was a great deal
worse that he was, of course. But he
went great lengths. Perhaps he had
been taking too much wine," she sighed,
plaintively.

"No," said Mrs. Reade. "He has
plenty of faults, but that is not one of
them."

Rachel was deeply hurt and shocked,"
Mrs. Hardy proceeded. "Naturally, for
it was not a thing she had been used
to, poor child. She took it very much
to heart  so much that she wanted,
like Mr. Lessel, to break off her engagement
there and then." Here Mrs. Hardy

went into details of poor Racliel's unsuccessful
struggle for deliverance. "But
of course I reasoned with the foolish
child," she added conclusively; "I talked
her out of that

Mrs. Reade sat very still, tracing
patterns on the floor with the point of
her parasol.

"And did they have a quarrel?" she
asked, vaguely. She was evidently thinking
of something else.

No. There was a coolness, of course,
but  oh, no, I am sure they did not
quarrel. He has seemed anxious to
make up for it, and she has not shown
any temper or resentment. But things
have been uncomfortable if you can
understand  very unsatisfactory and
uncomfortable  ever since. I think she
was disappointed in him, and cannot

get over it. I have been hoping that
it was all right, and that she was
only unsettled and dispirited about
leaving Adelonga. But now you mention
it  yes, now I think of it  I'm
afraid she is brooding over that other
trouble still. Foolish child ! she lives
in a world of romantic ideals, I suppose."


'' Why did Mr. Kingston flirt with
Minnie Hale ?" asked Mrs. Reade,
looking up at her mother impressively.


*' Oh, my dear, you know him as
well as I do."

'' You think he was worn out with
being good ?"

He has been good, Beatrice 
very good  ever since his engagement."


Yes, he has. But if lie had had
a mind to misbehave, I don't think
his duty to Rachel would have stopped
him. The fact is, since his engagement
he has never wanted anyone
but her. I have watched him closely,
and wonderful as it seems, he has
never shown the slightest disposition
to flirt beyond the stage of pretty
speeches  not even when she was
away  not even with Sarah Brown-low."


"It is a great pity," sighed Mrs.
Hardy. '' I wish they were safely
married."

And at the worst o times," the
younger lady proceeded thoughtfully,
regardless of the interjection, " he
was fastidious in his choice  he liked
someone who was either pretty or

clever, or decidedly attractive in some
WSJ. I never knew him take any
notice of a girl of that sort before."


'' There is no accounting for men's
tastes, my dear."

Oh, yes," Mrs. Reade replied
promptly ; ''I know that Minnie Hale
is not his taste. I know he did not
go on with her as you say he did,
merely for the pleasure of it to himself.
I think it must have been to
spite Rachel."

Beatrice !"

'' Yes, mother  that is what I think.
It is the only reasonable motive he
could have had."

But why on earth should he wish
to spite Rachel ?"

That is what T want you to tell

me. You were in the house with
them  try and think of all that happened
just before the ball. I'm
certain something was wrong between
them, to begin with. Perhaps you did
not notice it at the time, but you
might remember little circumstances  "
Mrs. Reade broke off, and watched
her mother's disturbed face with
bright attentiveness. " Rachel did not
flirt with anybody, did she ?"

Now, my dear, you know the
child is incapable of such a thing."

'* Oh, I don't mean deliberately, of
course. But she might do it accidentally,
with those sentimental eyes
of hers. And she u so charmingly
pretty !"

No, she certainly did not flirt,"
said Mrs. Hardy ; " she has never

given him any uneasiness on that
score, pretty as she is, and never
will, I am quite sure. But there was
a man "

Ah !" sighed Mrs. Reade, laying
her parasol across her knees, and folding
her hands resignedly.

Why do you say ' ah,' Beatrice,
before you hear what I am going to
tell you ? There was a man there
whom Mr. Kingston disliked very
much. He gave himself airs, and they
somehow came into collision, and Mr.
Kingston was in rather a bad temper.
That was all that went wrong before
the ball, and Rachel had nothing todo
with that."

Do you think so ? I am certain
she had," the young lady replied
deliberately.

Well, if you think you know better
than I do, who was there to
see "

Go on, dear mamma. Tell me all
about him. "Who was he ? What was
he like ?"

Mrs. Hardy, pocketing her dignity,
proceeded to describe Mr. Dalrymple,
with great amplitude of detail, ashe
had appeared from her point of
view.

The result was a kind of superior
Newgate villian, of good birth and
distinguished presence, whom Mrs.
Eeade regarded with a sinking
heart.

'' Oh, dear me !" she sighed, blankly,
what a pity ! What a previous
pity !"

I caiit see why you should look

at it in this way, Beatrice. I tell
you she had little or nothing to say
to him, and she only danced with
him once the whole evening. I took
care to point out to her the kind of
man he was, and to warn her against
him."

'' You ought not to have done
that."

"My dear, you will allow me to bethe
best judge of what I ought todo.
She was very good and obedient,
and she acted in every way as I
wished her."

"But she liked him, didn't she?"
asked Mrs. Eeade.

Yes," Mrs. Hardy admitted, with
evident reluctance, " I am afraid she
did like him."

I am sure she did," said Mrs.

Reade, decisively. " And there is more
than liking in the matter, unless I
am much mistaken. I have never
been in love myself," she remarked
frankly, 'but I fancy I know the
symptoms when I see them. I feared
from the first that it was something
of that sort that was the matter with
her. At any rate" putting up her
hand to stay the imminent protest on
her mother's lips  " at any rate, if
he has not made her love him, he
has made her discontented with Mr.
Kingston."

Well, Beatrice," the elder woman
exclaimed, with an impatient sigh,
rising from her chair, " if such a
thing should be  if such a misfortune
should have happened after all my
care  we must only do the best

we can to mend it. Thank goodness
he's gone. He is not at all likely
to give her another thought. If he
does  " Mrs. Hardy shut her mouth
significantly, and her Roman nostrils
dilated.

You can't help his thinking what
he likes," said Mrs. Reade, with a
gleam of mockery in her bright
eyes.

I can help his doing anything
further to disturb her. I can see
that he never meets or speaks to her
again."

Mrs. Eeade continued to smile, looking
at her majestic mother with her
bird-Hke head on one side.

I hope so," she said. " I'm sure
I hope so, if you can do it without
her knowledge. But if you should

have to act, whatever you do, don't
make martyrs of them."

Don't talk nonsense," retorted Mrs.
Hardy.

''he has co:\rE back."

ES. Head, being satisfied
that she had found out
Rachel's complaint  as indeed
she had  put her under treatment
without delay.

On the very day of her interview
with her mother in the store-room,
she sought and obtained permission to
take the patient home with her for a
week's visit, in order to try the experiment
of change and a new set of

282

dissipations, and to make her preliminary
investigations undisturbed.

Sbe bad a charming bouse of ber
own at South Yarra, wbicb sbe 'kept"
admirably, and were, in an pretensions
manner, sbe bad established a
little salon that was a fashionable bead
centre in Melbourne society, and well
deserved by virtue of its own legitimate
merits to be so.

Sbe was not severely orthodox in
these matters, like Mrs. Hardy, who
weighted her entertainments with any
number of dull people, if they only
happened to be in the right set ; though
she was quite ready to acknowledge
the propriety of her mother's system in
her mother's circumstances.

There was no want of refinement in
ber hospitality, but there was a delicate

flavour of Bohemianism that, like the
garlic rubbed on the salad bowl, was
the piquant element that made it
delightful  to those, at any rate, who
were sufficiently intelligent to appreciate
it.

If men and women were uninteresting,
she could have nothing to do with
them, though they were the very " best
people;" that is to say, she limited her
intercourse to those ceremonial observances
which rigid etiquette demanded.


If they were clever and cultured, and
otherwise respectable and well-behaved,
and were capable of being fused harmoniously
into the general brightness
of her little circle, she was inclined to
condone a multitude of sins in the
matter of birth and station.

Artists of all sorts, travellers and
politicians, distinguished members of
every profession (so long as their own
merits and accomplishments distinguished
them) were welcome at her house ;
where they would be sure to meet the
most interesting women that a judicious
woman, superior to the petty
weakness of her sex, could gather together.


So it was that Mrs. Edward Reade's
afternoons and evenings where synonymous
with all that was intellectually
refreshing and socially delightful to
those who were privileged to enjoy
them.

But so it was, also, that Rachel, inconsideration
of her youth, her impressionable
nature, and what were supposed
to be her democratic tendencies, had

not been allowed to know much about
them hitherto.

Now, however, the case is different,"
said Beatrice, authoritatively, as she
sat in her little pony carriage at the
front door, waiting for her cousin to
come down stairs. " It will do her
good bo shake up her ideas a little,
and draw her out of herself. And if
she does take an undue interest in
people of the lower orders "  looking
at her mother with mocking bright eyes
" it will be so much the better.
Perhaps Signor Scampering, with that
lovely tenor of his "

Oh, no, Beatrice. Mr. Kingston
would very much dislike anything of
that sort."

'anything of what sort?" laughed
Mrs. Reade. ''Mr. Kingston can trust

me, mamma. And we must counteract
Mr. Dalrymple somehow."

"Mr. Kingston himself ought to
counteract him  if there is any counteracting
necessary."

''Ah!" sighed Mrs. Reade, shaking
her head slightly. She said no more,
but in her own mind she put that
argument aside as useless.

There had been a time, indeed, when
she had believed Mr. Kingston sufficient
for all purposes, on the basis of
Rachel's apparently modest spiritual
needs; but now she knew she had been
mistaken.

The girl had grown and changed
since then, and the old conditions no
longer fitted her. The little woman was
disappointed, but she was too wise to
make a fuss about it. Difficulties had

come that she ought to have foreseen
and provided for, but since they had
come, they must be dealt with. "Ah!"
she said, with a sigh and a smile; and
that was the extent of her lamentation.


So Rachel went away with her to
South Yarra, and had a brilliant week
of it. The weather was warm and
lovely, and the soft air full of the
delicate intoxication of spring time, to
which she was peculiarly susceptible.

She basked in sunshine as she rattled
about Melbourne streets and suburbs in
Beatrice's little basket-carriage, and as
she sat in Beatrice's bow windowed
drawing-room, gossiping over afternoon
tea.

She had a month's allowance of society
dissipation of the most seductive description

in that week  music, dancing,
tableaux vivants, dressing, shopping,
sightseeing, swarms of gay and witty
company from noon till midnight, every
conceivable kind attention from her
cousin, and the most flattering homage
from everybody else  all in an easy and
cosy way that was very charming and
luxurious. It certainly cheered her up
a great deal.

We do get cheered, against our intention
and desire, against our belief
almost, by these little amenities that
appeal to our superficial tastes, even
when we seem to ourselves to be full of
trouble.

It is well for us that we are so
susceptible to light impressions, to the
subtle influences of the daily commonplace,
which are like delicate touches to

a crude picture in their effect upon our
lives ; if we were not, our lives would
hardly be worth having sometimes,
crippled as they are with great sudden
griefs and disappointments, and wasted
with the lingering paralysis of spiritual
loss and want.

Mrs. Reade, watching the effect of
her prescription day by day, thought
things were going on very nicely, and
took great credit to herself. She could
plainly perceive that the disturbing-element
in the family arrangements was
no trifling ball-room fancy ; but she had
great faith in the girl's youth and
gentle character, and in the efficacy of
judicious treatment, and it seemed to
her that her faith had not been misplaced.


At any rate, she justified her reputation

as a clever woman by the tact she
displayed in the management of her
self-imposed task. No one could have
done more, under the circumstances, to
further the desired end. She did not
have Mr. Kingston about her house
too much; she thought Rachel vould
appreciate him more if she had time to
miss him a little. Nor did she force
the girl's confidence with respect to
Mr. Dalrymple, or even invite it in anyway
 that is to say, not in any way
that was apparent to Tier.

She took no notice of the obvious
indications of her cousin's anxiety to
extricate herself from her engagement,
though secretly they caused her acute
uneasiness. She was a kind little soul,
and though quite content with a mariage
de convenance herself, did not like to

see another woman driven into it against
her will.

It was for Rachel's good that she
should be tided over those temptations
to squander a substantial future for a
romantic present, which were peculiarly
dangerous to a girl so undisciplined in
worldly wisdom as she, and it was absolutely
necessary to guard her against
the machinations of profligate spendthrifts
; but if she coidd have fallen in
with the excellent arrangements that
had been made for her, without repugnance
and suffering, what great cause
for thankfulness there would have been !

So, although she never wavered in
her determination to do what she considered
her duty, she did it, not only
with judgment, but with the utmost
gentleness and consideration.

She took Rachel to call on certain
shabby and faded women who had made
rash marriages with poor or unsteady
men, that she might see the consequences
of such imprudence in the
sordid tastelessness of their dress and
their household furniture.

She likewise presented to her notice
the charming spectacle of a young bride
of fashion, as she ' received " on her
return from her honeymoon, surrounded
by all the refinements of wealth
and culture in a perfectly-appointed
home.

She spoke incidentally, but often, of
the habits and customs of fast young
men, in general and in particular,
drawing picturesque illustrations from
her own experience, which tended to
show that they invariably made love to

every girl they came across, and forgot
all about her the moment her back was
turned. She showed her poetic photographs
of foreign cities ; she taught
her the value of old lace and china.

And by these and other insidious
devices, she really contrived to do something
towards weakening the impression
that Mr. Dalrymple had made, and
strengthening the antagonistic cause.

But when the week was over, and she
took her young charge back to her
mother, intending to apply for an extension
of leave, that she might pursue
the treatment that had proved so
beneficial, alas ! all her patient work
was undone in a moment, like the
web of the Lady of Shalt, when she
left off spinning to look at the irresistible
Sir Lancelot riding by.

They arrived at the Toorak house
rather late in the afternoon, after a
visit to the Public Library to see the
last new picture, and one or two entertaining
calls ; and they were told
that Mrs. Hardy was out, but was
expected in every minute.

Rachel jumped down from the carriage
first, and ran lightly up the
white steps into the hall, with a pleasant
greeting to the servant who admitted
her; and there she stood a few seconds,
to look round upon all the familiar appointments,
as people do when they return
home after an absence.

And as she looked, her eye fell upon
a card on the hall table, which she
immediately picked up.

John," she called sharply, wheeling
round upon him with a sudden fierceness

of excitement that Mrs. Reade, a
dozen yards off, understood to mean
disaster of some sort; "John, when did
this gentleman call?"

About half an hour ago, miss."
'' Oh, John  only half an hour !"
'' He said he would call again tomorrow,
miss."

Mrs. Eeade came softly into the hall,
carelessly adjusting her long train behind
her.

Who is it, dear ?" she asked.
But she had already guessed who
it was.

Rachel held out the little slip of
pasteboard with an unsteady, shrinking
hand. She could not speak. There was
a great light and flush of excitement
in her face, which yet was as full of
fear as joy.

VOL. II. 29

Rodenn Dalrymple," murmured Beatrice,
reading hesitatingly, as if the name were
unfamiliar to her. " Is not that one of
Lucilla's friends ?"

Yes," said Rachel, drawing a long
breath and speaking softly. " He was
at Adelonga when we were there. He
went away to Queensland, but  he has
come back."

'' Evidently he has. What a pity we
missed him. He may have brought us
some news from Adelonga. Oh, dear me,
don't you want your tea very badly ? I do.
John go and get us some tea, will you ?"

Mrs. Reade did not intend to commit
herself to any course of action until she
had time to think over this new and
most embarrassing complication, so she
dismissed Mr. Dalrymple from the
conversation.

Rachel turned the card about in her
hands, reading its inscription over andover
again. She was going to carry it
away; but she reluctantly went back
and laid it where she had found it.
Then she followed Beatrice into the
drawing-room like one in a dream.

The little woman watched her closely
from the corner of her bright eyes, and
she was terribly alarmed. She had had
no idea until now what a formidable
person this Rodenn Dalrymple was. The
girl was in a quiver of excitement from
head to foot. She wandered restlessly
about the room, vaguely fiddling at the
furniture and ornaments ; she could not
control her agitation.

John brought in the teapot, and Mrs.
Reade peeled her gloves from her small
white hands, and rolling them into a

29-2

soft ball, tossed them down amongst
the cups and saucers. She began to
pour out the tea in silence, wondering
what in the world she had better
do.

The silence was broken by the sound
of carriage wheels crunching up the
drive. Rachel came to a standstill in
the middle of the room, and listened
with a rigid intensity of expectation that
was quite as painful to her companion
as her more demonstrative emotion had
been.

They heard the bustle of Mrs. Hardy's
arrival, heard John open the front door,
heard the sweep of silken draperies in
the hall. And then they heard a familiar
voice, raised several notes above its
ordinary pitch.

John !"

Yes'm."

"When did this gentleman call?"

"About an hour after you left'm."

Did you tell him we were all
out ?"

"Yes'm. And he'll call again tomorrow,
he says."

Oh, indeed will he ! You'll just
tell him, whenever he calls, that I am
not at home, John  that nobody is at
home. Do you hear ? That gentleman
is not to be admitted."

Oh, you stupid woman !" Mrs. E-eade
sighed to herself, not meaning to be
disrespectful, but grudging to see delicate
work marred by inartistic hands.

And then she looked at Rachel, and
realised the catastrophe that had occurred.
All the colour had gone out
of the sensitive face, all its agitation,

all the soft, submissive tenderness that
had characterised it hitherto. She looked
straight before her, with stern eyes full
of indignant passion, and with her lips
set in a hard, thin line.

The meek little child, who had been
so easy to manage, was going to assert
the rights of womanhood, and to take
the conduct of her affairs into her own
hands.

THE LIGHT THAT NEVER WAS ON SEA OR
LAND."

R. DALRYMPLE was in Melbourne
for almost the whole
of the time that he had
intended to spare from his partner
and his property in Queensland, which
was nearly three weeks, and he never
once succeeded in communicating with
Rachel, which was the special mission
on which he had come down.

He called at the Toorak house
again and again, and was always

told that the ladies were not at
home.

There was not much else that he
could do at this stage of courtship,
knowing nothing of Rachel's circumstances
in connection with Mr. Kingston,
and having had no definite
assurances of her disposition towards
himself; but he did this persistently,
until he became suddenly aware that
Mrs. Hardy did not mean to admit
him.

Then he wrote a short note to
Mr. Gordon, containing certain instructions
in the way of business,
and an intimation that he might have
to stay in town longer than he
had anticipated, and, therefore, was
not to be calculated upon at
present.

Having despatched which, he addressed
himself to the matter he
had in hand, with a quiet determination
to carry it through, sooner or
later, by some means.

It was not his way to plot and
scheme clandestinely, but being driven
to do it, he did it promptly and with
vigour.

He wrote a long letter to Rachel,
reviewing with delicate significance
the position in which they had stood
to one another on the day of their
parting at Adelonga, and formally
offering himself for her acceptance ;
and he begged her to appoint sometime
and place where, if she were
willing, she could give herself and
him an opportunity for coming to a
mutual understanding.

This letter lie did not put into the
post, being naturally distrustful of
Mrs. Hardy, but he carried it in
his pocket ready for any chance
that might enable him to deliver
it with his own hands  for which
chance he began to search with
diligence in every place of public
resort where Rachel would be likely
to appear.

Rachel, in the meantime, was
distracted with suspense and misery.
She saw all possibilities of a legitimate
meeting relentlessly and effectually
circumvented.

She was kept under such strict
surveillance that she did not even
see her lover's face, except on one
occasion, when she was at the opera,
and when, sitting between her aunt

and Mr. Kingston, lie was afraid
to lift her eyes to look at
him.

She could do nothing in her own
behalf, while she was uncertain of
his intentions. She felt herself more
and more hopelessly in the toils of
her engagement, as day by day, Mr.
Kingston  who yet had mysteriously
changed somehow  became more and
more obtuse to the state of her
mind towards him, and more and
more persistently affectionate and
amiable, and as day by day, Mrs.
Hardy, grown hard and unsympathetic,
impressed more and more
strongly upon her the fact that she
was a penniless and friendless orphan
who owed everything that she had to
her.

And all the time she loathed the
very sound of Mr. Kingston's voice
and the very touch of his hand, with
an unreasoning passion of repugnance
that she had never thought it possible
she could feel for one who had
been so kind to her ; and as a
natural consequence  or cause  she
was consumed with a sleepless fever
of expectation and longing for that
other lover whom she loved.

But such a state of things could
not last, and after all it came to
an end much sooner than either of
them expected.

There came a night when Mr. and
Mrs. Hardy had to go to a stately
dinner party which did not include
young girls. A most lovely night it
was, in perhaps the loveliest month

of the year, when there was no
need to put candles in the carriage
lamps, and no need for a fire in the
big green drawing-room, where between
seven and eight o'clock Rachel was
left to amuse herself, in apparent
safety, until bed time. A young moon
shone in at the open windows before
the mellow daylight was gone, as
Mrs. Hardy, in rustling silk and
tinkling jewels, entered to say
good-night.

The evening wind went whispering
round the house, ruffling a thousand
tufts of bougainvillea that embossed
the outer wall, and breathing into
the dim room the sweetness of early
roses and the fresh fragrance of the
sea.

To Rachel, ever afterwards, it was

the most beautiful night that the
world had known.

"Now, my dear, John will light
the gas for you  two burners will do
to-night, John  and you can practise
your music undisturbed. Don't leave
the windows open any longer ; it will
be chilly by and bye. And don't sit
up late. Good-night."

Good-night, auntie," responded
Rachel.

She proffered the regulation kiss
in an absent manner, nodded with a
smile to her uncle, who was waiting
outside, and stood on the threshold
of a French window to watch the
carriage until it passed out of the
gates and disappeared.

Then instead of going to practise
her music, she went out and sat

down on the top of one of the
square pedestals that flanked the
steps of the terrace upon which the
window opened, and clasped her hands
about her knees.

John left the window open for
her, lit the gas and the piano
candles, returned to find her still
sitting in the same place, as if she
had not stirred, and went away to
make his own arrangements for a
pleasant evening.

Half an hour later she was wandering
about the garden, heedless of the
chill that was creeping on with
nightfall, and looking before her with
eyes so full of dreams that they did
not see where she was going to 
gliding up and down the level
terraces like a ghost in the dusky

twilight, with the silver of the moonshine
on her golden hair.

And then, by mere mechanical
submission to the force of habit,
she found herself presently at that
back gate which overlooked '' the
house," leaning her arms upon the
upper rail, and staring at the low
ridges of gleaming wall a few dozen
yards off, which were rising as it
seemed to her, with the rapidity of
magic from the foundations that had
taken so long to do, the stony embodiment
of a relentless fate.

It was very quiet there to-night.
No swarms of carpenters, and bricklayers,
and stone masons; no idle boys
gaping at them over the fence ; no
people walking and driving about the
road.

She tried the gate, and found it
locked; then she climbed lightly over
it, and holding up her skirts, stole
across the strip of arid waste that lay
between it and the nucleus of the
building which was once to have been
her palace, and now could only be
her prison-house, eager to discover
anything she could that would indicate
the real progress that was being
made.

She threaded her course daintily
through heaps of brick and stone and
broken debris ; she entered the skeleton
house by its gaping porch, and she
wandered about the labyrinth of its
passages and vestibules, feeling her
way with cautious feet and outstretched
hands, until she came to her own
boudoir ; and there she sat down on
VOL. II. 30

a joist of the flooring, and laid her
face on her knees and cried.

The sweetness of the solitary night,
quite as much as the sight of all those
permanently-adjusted ground-floor door
and window frames, melted her into
these sudden tears, full as she was of
the aching rapture of her love and
trouble, which needed but a touch to
overflow. The possibility of a human
spectator of her emotion never for a
moment occurred to her.

However, Mr. Rodenn Dalrymple had
also taken it into his head to have an
after-dinner walk in the moonlight, and
happening for a very good reason, to
be prowling about in this neighbourhood,
he had seen the slender little figure
gliding across the open space between
the back gate and the new building,

and he had guessed in a moment whose
it was.

And so, as Rachel sat with her feet
in subterranean darkness, her hands
clasping her knees just above the level
of the floor that was to be, and her
face hidden in her lap, she heard a
sound, suggestive of midnight robbers
and murderers, that for a moment
paralysed her timid heart ; and then a
voice, calling her softly,

'' Miss Fetherstonhaugh ! Do not be
frightened. It is only I  Rodenn Dalrymple."


He came in through the gap of the
doorway, while she stared at him and
held her breath ; he stepped swiftly
and lightly from joist to joist until
he reached the corner where she was
sitting.

30-2

Then he sat down beside her quietly,
as if he were taking a place she had
been keeping for him ; and the next
moment  with no question asked and
no explanation given  they were sealing
the most sacred of all contracts irrevocably,
in the silence of the solemn
night.

It was well for Rachel that, with all
his faults, Rodenn Dalrymple was not
the reprobate he was supposed to be,
but a man of stainless honour, in
whose keeping the welfare of an
ignorant and imprudent girl was safe;
for  from the day when she went into
the conservatory with him in the first
hours of their acquaintance, stranger ashe
was, and she the most modest of
girls, simply because he asked her  she
had laid herself, metaphorically, at his

feet  too simple and single in all lier
aims and impulses not to love unreservedly
when she began to love at
all, too strong in her young enthusiasm
for her own ideals to be hampered by
doubts either of herself or him, too
thoroughly natural and ingenuous to
disguise her heart or to bend it to
the yoke of conventional law and
order.

Now she gave herself up at once,
turning to meet his outstretched arms,
lifting her face to his strong and eager
kisses with a passionate responsiveness
and abandonment that, while it infinitely
quickened his love and gratitude, showed
him plainly that all the responsibility of
her future happiness would rest with him.

*'0h," she said, with a long sighing
sob, '' I have wanted you so !"

'have you indeed?" lie replied,
tightening his arms about her with a
gesture that was more significant
than speech. " My little love, you shall
never want me any more, if I can help
it."

These were the terms of their "initial
marriage ceremony."

And it is just to Mr. Dalrymple to
say that he not only never took the
slightest advantage of the irregularities
that she innocently allowed, but  at
any rate, not until long afterwards 
he never even saw them.

That they were candid and truthful
in themselves and to one another was
from the first the essential bond
between them, otherwise unlike as they
were ; and to him the absence of the
usual maidenly reticence and reluctance

displayed on these occasions indicated,
all circumstances considered, rather a
finer delicacy of nature than the ordinary,
and never the faintest suspicion
that she held the treasures of love
and womanhood cheaply, even for his
sake.

Feeling no need of further explanation
 understanding one another, by
that subtle sense which defies analysis,
that instinctive recognition of spiritual
kinship which, in its early development,
was to them what is called
'love at first sight," but which had
in it the germs of a true companionship
and comradeship that might defy
all the accidents of time and chance 
they sat for a few blessed silent
moments side by side, she with her
young head leaning trustfully against

his worn brown face, not wanting to
speak, unwilling even to think of all
the difficulties that lay in ambush
around them, ready to break into this
ineffable peace with the breaking of the
silence ; looking over a low windowsill
before them into the quiet night,
with grave and happy eyes  at Melbourne,
lying in a glorified haze of
twilight beneath them, and at the silver
of the sea beyond.

ELEVEN P.M.

ACHEL," said Mr. Dalrymple
presently, speaking her name
as if tie had had it in
familiar use for years, " I suppose you
have broken off with him ?

Rachel did not reply for a few
seconds ; he felt her trembling in his
arms.

Oh, forgive me," she whispered,
turning her face a hair's-breadth nearer
to his as he stooped to listen.

And then she told him all the story
of her engagement, as far as her new
experiences enabled her to read it, and
all the circumstances which had combined
to keep her still in captivity
so long after she should have been
free.

The simple narrative gave even him,
who was rather inclined to make molehills
of mountains, a sense of the
difficulties of the situation, that kept
him silent for a few minutes in unwonted
perplexity of mind.

How old are you?" he asked abruptly,
at last.

'' I shall be nineteen in three weeks,"
she answered.

You are sure you won't be twenty-one
?"

'' I'm sure I shan't. Why ?"

Because if you are only nineteen,
I cannot carry you off and marry you,
love, which would have been the simplest
way out of it."

I should not like that way," whispered
Rachel. '' It would be a wrong
way."

Yes, dear  except as a last resource.
Of course we would try all the other
ways first. But we must have our
rights, you know. If they won't give
them, we must take them  we must get
them as we can."

Cannot we be married until I am
twenty-one ?" she queried timidly.

ISTot without your guardian's consent.
Is there any chance of my getting that,
or any kind of toleration even, if I call
on him at his office tomorrow and
use all the eloquence at my command ?' '

"No. Aunt Elizabeth won't let him
have anything to do with it." .

"If I call on her, then?"

Oh, no  not the slightest. In the
first place, she won't see you. And
if she did  oh, no, you must not try
not yet ! I think it would make
everything worse than it is already."


Then you see the alternative ?  a
separation for perhaps two whole
years."

If I know we are going to be so
happy at the end of it "

Ah  at the end of it ! It will be a
fine test for you, Rachel."

Why for me, any more than for
you ? Oh, don't talk of tests !" she
pleaded ; "I only want to feel sure
I shall never lose you, and I

don't mind waiting two years. If
only "

If only what ?"

''If only Mr. Kingston would go
away !"

Now listen to me," he said gently,
but with his grave peremptoriness, " you
must not let another day pass without
breaking off with him. You
must send him away, Rachel. I am
sorry for him, poor devil, but you
couldn't do him a worse wrong than
let him go on deceiving himself about

you."

Oh, do you think I would do that ?
Of course I will not. I can do it now
now that you have come. For now
I shall feel strong, and now I can tell
them why. I shall write him a letter
before I go to bed, and I shall tell

Aunt Elizabeth as soon as I have sentit.
But what will they say to me ? It
will be dreadful."

Poor little woman ! Can't I take the
dreadful part of it for you ? I shan't
mind it."

You can't. I know it will be better
for us both if you will not have anything
to do with it just yet."

I think I Qiiust see your uncle, dear,
before I go away again."

'well if you think it best. But it
will do no good with Aunt Elizabeth. He
leaves it all to her."

Mr. Dalrymple gazed thoughtfully at
the distant horizon, where little points
of yellow twinkled in the silvery obscurity
of the moonshine bay.

He was deeply troubled and perplexed
about this tender little creature, and

the idea of leaving her to bear the
brunt of unknown trials for bis sake,
seemed too preposterous to be taken
seriously. And yet what else could he
do?

Tell me," he said presently, stroking
her silky head as it lay on his breast,
'' tell me what is the worst that can
happen to you, Rachel ?"

'the worst," sighed Rachel, 'will
be hearing Aunt Elizabeth tell me that
I have repaid all her generosity and
kindness to me with ingratitude and
treachery."

That will be very bad. But you
will have to try and make her understand
the real right and justice of it,
love. She must see it, unless she is
stone blind. She can't expect us to
outrage all the laws of nature to suit

her narrow schemes. You don't think
there will be anything still worse ?  that
she will make your life wretched by
making you feel your dependence  that
kind of thing ?"

'' I am not sure," said Rachel. " She
has been very, very good to me; but
lately  since she has got suspicious
about you  she has been hard. However,
if the worst comes to the worst,
I can go and be a governess or companion
somewhere until you are ready forme."


No, Rachel, no ; you must promise
to tell me if you are persecuted in anyway
 if you are miserable in your aunt's
house and my sister Lily will take care
of you. You are not to let the worst
come to the worst  do you hear ? You
must let me know of anything that

happens, and I will come at once and
see about it. Oh, my poor little one, I
begin to realise what sacrifices you
will have to make for me ! Will you
think the game was worth the candle,
I wonder, when you are as old as I
am?"

Yes," said Rachel ; '' I know I shall
if you will be as contented with me
then as you are now."

"Do you really think you have
counted the cost ? " he persisted
anxiously. " Remember, you were going
to marry Mr. Kingston, because you
thought it would be nice to be rich
and to hive in a grand house and to
wear diamonds."

That was before I had seen yon.
I don't want to be rich now. Indeed,
I would rather not."

VOL. II. 31

Has anybody told you how poor I
am ?"

'' Yes," she whispered, stealing a timid
hand to his shoulder. " I have been
thinking of it. Beatrice says it is a
mistake for poor men to marry  that
they cripple their career. But I hope
I think  I shall not be any burden
to you. Once I was poor, too, and I
know all about it, and I can manage
with a very little. I think I could help
you in lots of ways, and not be a
hindrance."

"A hindrance, indeed !" he interrupted.
My darling, if I had you for my companion,
life would be sweet enough forme,
under any circumstances. It was
your comfort and happiness I was thinking
of."

I only want to be with you," she said.

under her breath. '' I don't care where 
I don't care how."

'' Really, Rachel ?"

"Really, indeed."

Yon are so young ! Think what a
number of years you have before you,
in all probability. If you should lose
the colour out of your life too soon, if
you should have to drudge  but I won't
let you drudge," he added, with a sudden
touch of fierceness, " T will take care
of you, and you shall have all you
want. It won be a sacrifice  not
even all this"  looking round him  "if
you give it up for a man you love, who
has health and strength to work for
you. It would make you miserable if
you had it. You know it would?"

I do know it," she responded, without
a moment's hesitation.

312

She had finally made up her mind
that after all material poverty was not
the worst of life's misfortunes. Indeed,
provided the element of debt were
absent, she thought it might in Eoden
Dalrymple's company, " far from the
madding crowd," in the lonely wilds
of Queensland, be rather pleasant than
otherwise ; for it would mean the delight
of working for and helping one another,
and a blessed freedom from interruption
and restraint in the enjoyment of that
wonderful married life which would be
theirs.

'but I should like to know what
made you take to me," he went on,
in the immemorial fashion, stroking
ber soft face. " I should like to
know why you chose, for your first love
I am your first, am I not, Rachel ?"

You knoiv you are. And it was no
matter of choice with me  you know
that, too."

A man who made shipwreck of his
fortunes for another woman almost before
you were born "

'' Hush !" interrupted Rachel. " I have
no rights in your past, and I don't want
any. This present is mine, and that is
enough for me."

A battered old vagabond "

"No," she persisted; "I won't allow
you to call yourself a vagabond. It is
bad enough to hear other people doit."


'after seeing him under what one
would be inclined to consider, well, anything
but favourable auspices for how
many days, Rachel?"

Oh," she said, hiding a scarlet

face, " don't remind me of that ! It
was too soon  but I could not help
it"

"The sooner the better, my sweet 
if it lasts," he responded, kissing her
with solemn passion; 'rand I will make
it last."

Do not be afraid of that," she whispered
eagerly. *' I know I am young 
I know one ought not to be too positive
about the future  but Feel that it will be
impossible to help loving you always, even
if I try not to, which I certainly shan't.
I am sure I began it when I saw you
riding across the racecourse that day 
I am sure I shall not stop any more
as long as I live. I don't think there
can be another man in the world like
you."

And so they talked, until it occurred

to one of them to wonder what the
time was. Mr. Dalrymple struck a
match and looked at his watch, Rachel
shielding the small flame from the wind
with her hand.

Ob," she exclaimed in dismay,
'' what would Aunt Elizabeth say if
she knew I was sittings out here at

o

eleven o'clock at night !"

"Call it eleven p.m," he suggested,
looking at her with his slow smile ;
'' that sounds so much better."

"Did you think it was so late? The
time has flown."

"I felt it flying," he replied. "But
I did not think it was so late. I'm
afraid you must go home, little one.
Oh, dear me, when shall we have
such a time again ! Will you come
here tomorrow night, and tell me

how sou have got over your day's
troubles ?"

This was not a proposal that Rachel
could accept comfortably, nor that he
could bring himself to press upon her.
But when they came to reconsider their
position and necessities, it was hard to
find an alternative.

'' You see, I must go back to Queensland
in a day or two," Mr. Dalrymple
explained, when, having taken her out
of her hole and dusted her skirts with
his handkerchief, he led her through
the labyrinth of walls into the open
moonlight, and they paused, hand in
hand, for a few last words. " We have
an immense deal to do up there, and
Gordon wants me. I must look after
getting things together for you too.
There is not even a roof for your head

yet. But I can't bear to leave town
without knowing first how matters
are likely to go with you."

If you should be obliged to do that
if I cannot see you again," said
Rachel, " when will you come back?"

I will come back in  let me see,
this is October  in two months. I
will be back at Christmas. I should
have liked to see your uncle tomorrow,
just that there should be no mistake
about what I mean to do \ but if you
think it will make things harder for
you, I won't, of course. You shall
just tell Kingston what you like, and
the rest of them I will enlighten when
I come. By that time he will be out
of the way and done with, and
we shall have a straight road before
us."

"Yes," said Rachel, sighing; '' I
think that will be best. And perhaps,
hj that time, Aunt Elizabeth will let
you in."

"If she doesn't, I shall bombard the
house."

"You will be sure to be back at
Christmas ?"

"If I am alive, dear, and a free
agent  certainly. And I shall find you
ready for me then?"

Oh, yes !"

With this compact between them, and
the giving to Rachel of her lover's town
address, and very explicit directions as
to where she might find him at any
given hour when she might happen to
want him until the day of his departure,
they kissed one clinging, lingering kiss in
motionless silence, and bade one another 

though they did not know it  a long
farewell.

Which is your window, Rachel ?
Can I see it from here?"

She pointed to it in silence, it was
very distinct just now in the moonshine,
between two dark pine trees. She was
crying a little, and she could not
speak.

"I will be here tomorrow night," he
said; "and if you can't come out tome,
have a light in your room at twelve
o'clock, darling, to let me knows you are
all right."

And then they separated; and Rachel
felt rather than saw her way home, so
dazzled with tears was she, while Rodenn
Dalrymple at her desire remained behind
and watched her.

She went straight into the house and

upstairs to her room, to gather together,
in a feverish hurry of renunciation, all
her diamonds and jewels, which like
Dead Sea apples, had suddenly become
dust.

And he, long after she was gone,
long after Mrs. Hardy's carriage returned,
and all the chimes in the city
had rung the midnight hour  lingered
where she had left him, leaning his
arms on a convenient wall, watching a
lighted window, and thinking. He was
very happy. He had come unawares
upon his happiness, when he was most
in need of it, and it seemed to him
that it was the best he could have
had.

Anything sweeter than this fresh and
simple heart, which was satisfied
to invest all its wealth in him 

anything brighter than the future she
had spread before him  he did not want
or wish for. It was the amplest compensation
that he could imagine for the
mistakes and disappointments of his
wasted past.

And yet, though he was hardly conscious
of it  though he would not have
owned to it if he had been  he had a
vague misgiving about her. He did not
wish that she had been less easy to
win ; he had no fear that she was mistaking
a sentimental girlish fancy for
love ; he did not for a moment apprehend
that she would forsake or wrong
him.

But there was a suggestion of untried
and untested youth about all the circumstances
of this sudden betrothal, as
far as she had influenced them, and there

was an intangible suspicion that somewhere
she was weak.

He did not recognise, and therefore
did not formulate, the sentiment that
infused that touch of grave and sad
anxiety into his happy meditations ; but,
nevertheless, it was there, and the time
came when it was justified.

MRS. READE S ADVICE.

ACHEL was not a heroine.
She was simply a sweet and
interesting girl ; except that
she was unusually pretty, by no means
above the ordinary level of nice girls.
She was better than a great many
that we are acquainted with, no
doubt, but she was not so good as
some.

And she had, as has been already
indicated, that fault which, of all

faults, perhaps, is most common to
girls, whether nice or otherwise  that
amiable weakness that is more disastrous
in its consequences than many a
downright vice  she was, if not quite
a coward, cowardly.

She was afraid to meet difficulties
in the open, as it were  to attack the
main body and scatter them, and have
done with it ; she sheltered herself
in ambush, and made desultory attacks
on flank and rear with temporary
compromises, hating the thought of
duplicity and longing to do right, yet
most of all dreading the violent, harsh
hurt to tender sensibilities (whether
her own or other people's) that was
inevitable in the shock of a pitched
battle.

It is a defect in a woman's character

very raucli to be deplored, of course,
and it is one that seems unpardonable
to a strong-minded person.

Nevertheless, it is much more of a
misfortune than a fault (and we mayas
well say the same, while we are
about it, of all our constitutional
defects, from red hair to kleptomania,
since we did not choose our parents
nor the social conditions to which we
were born) ; and. to Rachel, whose
instinctive truthfulness and. high sense
of moral rectitude prompted her to
struggle hard, if vainly, against it, it
was purely a misfortune, and at no
time in her life more so than
now.

For, after turning the question over
and over in her mind through all that
feverish and wakeful night, she finally

VOL. II. 32

decided that in breaking off her
engagement with Mr. Kingston she
would not mention, either to him or
to anyone else, the place that Mr.
Dalrymple 'now occupied in her affections
and affairs.

As no one was aware of their
having met, and as he was coming
back himself so soon to clear up
everything much better than she could,
she persuaded herself that it would
be not only unnecessary, but in
the highest degree inexpedient, to
aggravate the inevitable pain and difficulty
that was before her and all of
them.

Hating his very name as they did,
would she not expose her lover to
insult, and his motives and actions
to misconception, and probably prejudice

their chances of happiness irrevocably
?

And at the same time do no good
whatever, but only add an element
of unspeakable bitterness to the disappointment
of her aunt, and to the
mortification of her already ill-used
and much-wronged fiance, and, as a
matter of detail, an incalculable amount
of difficulty to her own sufficiently
formidable task? She was certain that
she would, and she felt that she could
not, and need not do it.

It took her all night to mature
her course of action, but having
finally brought herself to believe that
it was not only so much the easiest
to herself, but in every way the best
for all concerned, to ignore Mr.
Dalrymple for the present, she 



mitted herself to it by writing a long
letter to Mr. Kingston  a tender, penitent,
self-accusing letter, in which she
begged him to forgive her for having
discovered so much too late that they
were un suited to one another, and
prayed that he might some day be
happier with a better woman than it
was in her power to make him, and
that he would ever believe her his
attached and grateful friend, without
suggesting the existence or possibility
of any other lover, present or to be.

The natural results followed  Mr.
Kingston, seeing no sufficient reason
for these sudden strong measures,
refused to treat them seriously.

He was quite aware, and it troubled
him deeply, that she was not happy
in her engagement, and he was very

jealous and suspicious of Mr. Dalrymple,
-whom lie had seen once or
twice about town ; but lie had set his
hearse upon her, as we sap, with the
perverse obstinacy of a fickle man who
had been spoiled by women's flattery,
and the more she seemed to shrink
from him the more he wanted to have
her, and the more he was determined
not to let her go if he could possibly
help it.

His love not only lacked reciprocity
without which love is never worthy
to be spelt with a capital L  but it
was so diluted with all sorts of vanities
and egotism that, though its flavour
was there, the potent spirit was absent,
and he was incapable of making a sacrifice
for her happiness at the expense
of his own.

When he solemnly assured himself
that he loved her as he had never
loved anyone before, and that he could
not and would not give her up when
he declared, moreover, that he was
ready to spend his future life in her
service, and would take his chance of
making her care for him  he not only
told the truth, as far as he understood
it, but perhaps he touched the
highest point of heroism of which his
selfish nature was capable.

All the same, the strong necessities
of the case were the carrying out of
the great enterprise which was symbolised
by the half-built house, and
the realisation of his schemes for his
own enjoyment ; the possession (and
the securing from other men) of the
most attractive, the most admired,

and to him most loveable woman of
his set, who had so to speak given
him. a legal lien upon her person;
the maintenance of his social position
and dignity, and the avoidance of
ridicule and embarrassment.

So when he had read Rachel's letter,
with a great expense of bad language
in the first place, and of wise reflection
subsequently, he made up his
mind that it was merely the result of
their Adelonga differences, which had
been rankling in her sensitive heart,
and not the formal resignation that he
would be required to accept.

Into, no, young lady," he said to
himself, as he made a careful toilet
before setting forth to see her, '' I
have not sacrificed my liberty and all
my comfortable habits, at your instigation

and for your sake, to take
mj cone at the eleventh hour in this
way."

And then he cast about in his
mind anxiously for ways and means
whereby he might meet and overcome
this strange reluctance, which not only
seemed to him a cruel injury and
injustice after all he had done for
her, but really distressed him acutely,
and made him extremely unhappy.

Was there anything amongst Kilpatrick's
glittering treasures that would
tempt her to smile and kiss him, and
be sorry that she had given him this
heartless blow ?

He felt to-day that he would spend
a thousand pounds cheerfully for anything
that would please her.

But at the same time he was

uneasily conscious that even the largest
and purest diamonds would not appreciably
affect the situation.

She was no longer open to these
fascinations, as she used to be ; several
little circumstances had convinced him
of that.

It was a bad sign, he feared ; but
he hoped it indicated nothing more
serious than that the novelty of wealth
and luxury had worn off.

He recognised its existence so far
that he went on his delicate mission
to Toorak, trusting to his own merits
and eloquence, with no bribes of any
sort in his pocket.

After all, he did not see Rachel that
day. She was weeping hysterically in
her bedroom at the top of the house,
and therefore was not presentable.

Mrs. Hardy, much excited and discomposed
by the shock she had just
received (on being told by Rachel that
she had not only written a letter to
her fiance, to break off her engagement,
but had sent it), received him in
the drawing-room, and did the best
that wisdom, at such short notice,
suggested to repair the catastrophe
which she had been powerless to
prevent.

She tried to smile and joke, in a
considerate and well-bred manner ; she
rallied him upon his misconduct in the
matter of Miss Hale, which had evidently
been at the bottom of all the
mischief, gently pointing out to him
that a sensitive nature like Rachel's,
and a tender heart that loved and
trusted him, could not be played with.

even in the conventional fashion, with
impunity.

And then she hastened to explain
the suddenness and unexpectedness of
this 'freak;" how sure she was that
it had been perpetrated under the
influence of a fit of temper or dejection,
or some other unhealthy condition
of mind ; how equally sure she was
that it was already repented of 
though, of course, it was not for her
to give an opinion or to interfere. All
of which would have been very proper
and sensible, but that the effect was
marred by a bubbling under-current of
angry excitement that her utmost efforts
could not hide.

Mr. Kingston watched and listened,
with smiling self-possession. Finding
that he was not to see Rachel, nor to

get any fresh information, lie did not
prolong the interview. He had no
confidence in Mrs. Hardy  few men
had, in matters of this kind. He received
her communications in a friendly
manner, as one receives an embassy
under a flag of truce ; he never thought
of allowing himself to be influenced by
them one way or the other, or of
asking her assistance and advice.

As soon as courtesy permitted, he
bowed himself out of her presence, with
magnanimous expressions of good will
and a request that nothing might be
be said or done to distress or embarrass
Rachel. And then he got into his cab
thoughtfully, and went to South Yarra
to call on Mrs. Reade.

It was not one of this young lady's
reception days, as no one knew better

than himself; nor had she left her
house in pursuit of tea and gossip at
other people's "afternoons," as he half
expected would be the case.

The sprightly maid-servant (all Mrs.
Eeade's servants were maids, and all of
them sprightly), who opened the door
to his thundering knock, recognising a
privileged friend of the family, admitted
him with alacrity; and he walked into
the drawing-room and found his hostess
sitting' there alone, nestling in one of
her seductive low chairs with an open
letter on her knee.

She, too, had just received the news
of Rachel's escapade ; the letter, full
of dashing and incoherent sentences,
was in Mrs. Hardy's handwriting, and
had arrived half an hour ago from
Toorak. But there were no signs of

excitement and discomposure about this
little person, who rose to meet him,
looking cool and bright, with even
the suspicion of a twinkle in her
eyes.

Have you come for a gossip ?" she
asked, looking up at him with friendly
frankness. '' Because if you have you
had better send your cab away. I am
going out at five o'clock, and I'll drive
you into town."

The cab was sent away; and Mr.
Kingston, with a feeling of comfort
and safety about him, sat down in a
bow-windowed recess, in his favourite
of all the cunningly-devised chairs, and
with his elbows on his knees, began to
fiddle with the top of a silk sock, at
the toe of which his companion was
now knitting industriously.

Is this for Ned ?" he inquired, after
a pause.

Now, isn't that a superfluous question
? " she replied, holding it up.
Look at the size of it. Could any
foot but his fill out that enormous
bag ? Of course it is for Ned. Don't
you know it is the new fashion for
wives to knit their husband's socks ?
One must be in the fashion, even if
one's husband is a giant."

Very nice for one's husband. It
seems beautifully soft ; pretty colour,
too." Then, after a pause, " Does
Rachel know how to knit?"

'eyes," said Mrs. Reade, calmly;
we both learned together while she
was staying with me, and she does it
much quicker than I do. I suppose
you are thinking you would like to

participate in the benefits of the fashion
too?" she added, lifting her face suddenly,
with a quick look in her bright
eyes that was like the opening of a
masked battery.

"If I thought that Rachel would
ever knit socks for me, for the pleasure

of it " He paused with a change

and break in his voice, regarding her
wistfully.

Mrs. Eeade immediately made a sheaf
of her needles, wound them up in the
sock, and impaled her ball of silk upon
them. *' Tell me," she said, folding her
hands on her knees in a business-like
manner, *' tell me, what has Rachel been
doing ?"

Don't you know ? She has written
to me to break off our engagement."

'what for?"

I can't imagine  she doesn't say. I
thought yoio might be able to help me
to find that out."

Mrs. Reade looked at him in silence
for a few seconds, kindly and gravely.
Even she felt herself a little at a loss
as to what course to pursue.

'what have you done?" she asked
abruptly.

"Nothing. I went up to see her just
now, but I was disappointed. She could
not, or would not, come in. I rather
fancy your mother had been scolding
her."

"I have no doubt she had. She
doesn't approve of independence on the
part of young people."

''I won't have her scolded," Mr.
Kingston broke out, with sudden
vehemence. " If I like to blame her,
VOL. II. 33

that is another matter. I won't have
her set against me by other people.
Nothing would make her hate me more
than that kind of thing."

Mrs. Reade felt the justice of this
protest, but she did not see fit to
discuss her mother's little mistakes.
'MVhat are you going to do?" she
inquired.

'' Do you mean am I going to take
my dismissal in this off-hand way? No,
certainly not. After all the time we
have been engaged  after all that has
come and gone between us  after all
the preparations that have been made
it would be too preposterous ! I
should be the laughing-stock of the
colonel's

That would be very sad," said Mrs.
Reade, with her head on one side.

"Now be a good little woman, and
don't jeer at me  I didn't come to you
for that. You know  or you ought to
know  that I am horribly upset and
miserable about all this business, and
that I want you to help me."

I don't see how I can help you,"
she said.

Tell me about Rachel. "What is
the matter with her ? What does she
mean ?"

sewell, evidently she means that she
doesn't want to marry you," sighed Mrs.
Reade. " Tiresome child, why didn't
she think of it before ? "

Why should she think of it now ?
Oh, yes, I know she has not been keen
about it for some time, as she should
have been. But she has not seemed to
dislike it ; she has looked forward toit

as as much a matter of comes as
as it has been to all the rest of
us. And I felt so sure it would be
all right  that I could make her as
happy as possible  when we were
once married and she had settled
down !"

It was not often that Mrs. Eeade was
perplexed, but now  between her duty
to her family, her strong affection for
Rachel, and her desire to assist her
friend  she really did not know what
to do. While she was silent, struggling
with the dilemma in her active mind,
Mr. Kingston went on.

"It is since she went to Adelonga
that she has changed so much. Haven't
you noticed ?"

"You did not behave very well to herat
Adelonga, you knov."

Who told you that ? Did she ?"

Never mind who told me. There is
never any secrecy about your proceedings
 I will give you that credit.
You treated her very badly at Lucilla's
ball."

"Not worse than she treated me,"
he began, impetuously ; and then he
paused and looked at his hostess. He
was gentleman enough to shrink from
discussing Rachel's misdeeds in connection
with " that Dalrymple fellow,"
but he longed to find out how much
her wise cousin and late companion
knew. Mrs. Reade fingered her knitting
with a placid and impenetrable
face.

*' Tell me  you know Rachel so intimately
 do you think "

Do 1 think what ?"

That there is anyone she cares for 
more than she cares for me ?"

He was impelled, against his better
judgments to ask this awkward question.
Mrs. Eeade gathered herself together,
so to speak ; it was one of those
sudden emergencies that inspire a brave
woman.

'If I thought she cared for anyone
who was a better man, and could make
her happier than you," she said deliberately,
looking him straight in the face,
she should have him, or it would not
be my fault."

'' But she does not ?"

So far as I know she does not.
But," she was an honest little woman,
and it gave her a pang to mislead
him, even though she did it for what
seemed to her a good end, "but, at

the same time, no doubt she does
not care for you as she ought todo."


I hope that will come," he said cheerfully."


If only Mr. Dalrymple did not stand
in his way, he felt all difficulties manageable.


"It is a great risk ; you ought to
think well before you take it."

I have thought well."

And I will be no party to making
her take it against her will."

But I think she will be willing if
she is treated properly. Of course I
don't want to marry her by force. I
want to bring her round to like it as
she used to like it. If there is nobody
else, why not? And you ill help me,
won't you?"

Mrs. Reade looked at him with bright
and friendly eyes. He was really taking
it very well considering how badly he
had been treated, and how extremely
susceptible he was to indignities of
this, or indeed any description. He
certainly must be strangely in love
with that perverse child, she thought
much more in love than she had
ever expected to see him  to be able
to put his wrongs in the background
like this. He deserved to be helped.

And as far as human judgment was
to be trusted, to help him would be to
play Providence to Rachel.

I will do what I can," she said
kindly. 'that is to say, I won't
interfere, but I'll give you good advice
whenever you do me the honour to
ask for it."

Thank you ; I ask for it now. What
do you advise me to do ?"

She pondered a few moments, watching
him thoughtfully.

You are quite sure, once for all,
that you think it worth while to
throw yourself away on an ungrateful
little monkey who doesn't appreciate
you ?"

'* I'm quite sure I want to marry
Rachel. I hope she will appreciate me,
but if she doesn't  well, I want to marry
her all the same."

*' And are willing to take the consequences
?"

Oh, yes ; I'm not afraid of consequences
 once the wedding is over."

He smiled as he made this almost
sacrilegious assertion, which implied a
marital control of consequences that was

offensive in the ears of the little woman,
who liked to see husbands kept in their
proper places.

Don't boast," she said sharply, "you
might find yourself in a very unpleasant
position when the wedding was
over. And you will, too, if you don't
mind."

The dialogue was interrupted at this
point. A little brougham rattled past
the window on its way from the
stable-yard to the front-door, and a
servant came in with tea.

Mrs. Reade looked at her watch, and
her guest's face fell.

Is it five o'clock ?" he exclaimed testily
; '* and you have not given me any
advice 1"

'will you have a cup of tea?" she
inquired, coolly.

No, thank sou. Must you go out this
afternoon ?"

Well, I could hardly countermand
the carriage now, because you are here,
could I? We'll have a drive somewhere
before we go in to town,
and I'll give you advice as we go
along."

She drank her tea standing in the
middle of the room, and then leavings
him to fret and fume by himself, went
away to dress, and in the retirement
of her own apartment to concoct a
definite scheme of action.

In a few minutes she came back alert
and bright, in a very charming French
bonnet, and with yards of silken train
behind her. She was ready for him in
every sense of the word.

As soon as they were out upon the

road, and she had finished buttoning
a refractory glove, she said gravely,
with an air of having solved all
doubts,

Now I will tell you what you must
do."

Yes ?"

You must accept Rachel's dismissal."

'' What ! I'm sure I shall not do anything
of the kind."

Mrs. Eeade laid herself back in the
carriage and folded her hands.

Very well," she said, calmly.

No, but really  I beg your pardon 
I don't understand you. Do you mean
I must just give her up and have done
with it ? Because you know it is just
that that I can't do."

Not at all. But don't ask my
opinion "

'rob, ses, do tell me what you
mean."

"Well, I was going to suggest that
you see or write to Rachel and tell her
you will do what she wishes rather than
distress her; but that, while leaving her
free, you will consider yourself still as
much bound to her as ever, and wait
in hope that she will come back to you
comedy. That kind of thing, you know."

Oh, yes, that is all very well. And
in the meantime I shall be getting old 
that is to say, I shall be losing time 
and she will be sure to be run after
by other men the moment my back is
turned."

It will be better to lose a little time
than to worry her now," said Mrs.
Reade. " If you draw off from her a
little, she will miss you, and then probably

lie will want you, and provided
you left her assured of your faithfulness,
and didn't go flirting with Miss
Hales and people, it would be just the
kind of delicate and chivalrous consideration
for her that she would appreciate.
Yes, I know Rachel; it would
touch her heart deeply."

But some other fellow might get
hold of her  finding she was free, you
know."

'' I think," said Mrs. Reade, smiling
slightly, *' that we may safely leave my
mother to look after that."

Upon consideration Mr. Kingston
thought so too. He began to see
glimmerings of wisdom and reason in
this proposed course.

'' But your mother will have to be
looked after herself," he said, breaking

a little pause abruptly. " If I am not
to worry Rachel, nobody else shall."

*' Of course. I will look after my
mother."

And suppose," he continued presently,
deep in troubled thoughts, '' suppose
she never renews the engagement
after all?"

"Oh, well suppose the world comes
to an end tomorrow  we can't help
it!"

"Do you think she will?"

"I do think she will  honestly, I
do  if you are patient and gentle, and
do as I tell you. She will be dull
and lonely; she will miss you about
her, and not only you, but many
pleasant things that are associated with
you ; she will bethink herself that she
has treated you badly  as indeed she

has  and she is so tender-hearted that
it will fret her. And if she sees you
occasionally, not in season and out of
season, but now and then, at opportune
times, and you do her little voluntary
services in a delicate and unobtrusive
way  then some of these days, seeing
you still, she will suddenly think that
she loves you, and well, then it will be
all right, you know."

Oh, I hope so !" he broke out, with
a deep, impatient sigh  though it was
not a great deal to hope for when it
came to be reckoned up. " But how
long will she be reaching that point ?"

"It depends."

' And we were to have been married
in a couple of months  three at the
most. Upon my honour, it is too
bad !"

I shouldn't be surprised if you were
married quite as soon as you arranged
to be," Mrs. Eeade proceeded calmly,
building this comfortable theory upon
the conviction that Mr. Dalrymple, in
spite of his persistence in calling at
Toorak, was not the kind of man to
remain faithful to a ball-room fancy,
nor to undertake anything so expensive
and so respectable as matrimony under
the most favourable conjunction of circumstances
; and feeling sure that Rachel,
with her clinging, impulsive nature,
finding her desires frustrated in this
direction, would be under an imperious
necessity to seek  or, at any rate, to
accept  support elsewhere. ''If I had
her with me for six weeks, I think
I would not mind risking a small
bet "

VOL. II. 3i

Can sou have her with you ?" Mr.
Kingston interposed eagerly.

No, I fear not. My mother would
not consent to let her go from home
just now. The situation is too grave.
But even as things are, if you manage
the child properly, I don't at all despair
of seeing you married  or, at any rate,
engaged again  before the year is out.
Very far from it."

'' I would give a thousand pounds
at this moment if I could be certain
that that would be," sighed Mr. Kingston,
plaintively.

Only you must do what I tell you.
I assure you, if you leant to succeed,
that is your best, if not your only
chance* Will you do what I tell
you?"

I will see Racliel first."

'' Of course. See her and give her
plainly to understand what a pain and
and disappointment it is to you to give
her up, and that you only do it for her
sake. Perhaps, if you talk it over with
her, she will cancel her letter, and it
will be all right at once ; in which case
you had better arrange for your marriage
as quickly as possible. But if it should
be otherwise  if she should still press
for a dissolution of her engagement 
let her go for a little while. It need not
be for long."

I think I will," said Mr. Kingston,
thoughtfully. And he did.

UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

RS. Evade was accustomed
not only to give advice and
to see it taken, but to seethe
wisdom of it justified in the success
of its practical application.

Nevertheless, she was more surprised
than Mr. Kingston himself at the great
and good results which apparently followed
her interference in his affairs.
Matters were a little critical for a week
or two.

Of course he " saw " Rachel, and
attacked the position which she had
taken up with all the forces at his
command. He was, in his Mentor's
judgment, indiscreetly zealous and persevering
; and the almost fierce obstinacy
of Rachel's resistance, which neither
science nor brute force could overcome,
being an altogether anomalous demonstration
of character, was even more
portentous.

But when presently Mr. Kingston, ina
dignified and graceful letter, accepted
his defeat, while at the same time
clearly intimating that the withdrawal
of his former pretensions in no way
indicated any change in his affections
and fidelity, then everything seemed to
go well.

The girl was touched and grieved to

the depths of her tender heart for the
wrong and the trouble that she had
inflicted upon him, and was in agonies
of anxiety for his welfare.

Do you think he will go back to
Miss Brownlow ?" she inquired one day
of Beatrice, with pathetic eyes full of
tears ; "and, oh, do you think she will
make him happy ?"

She was terribly taken aback when
her cousin with much asperity upbraided
her with the heartlessness of the suggestion.


For a little while, having received her
aunt's grudging acquiescence in the dissolution
of her engagement, having sent
back all her jewels, having surreptitiously
despatched a note to her lover in
Queensland (which she implored him not
to answer) to tell him that she was

honourably free, and living in the
anticipation of his return, Racliel began
to blossom in beauty and brightness
again, like a flower that night had
chilled in the warmth of morning


It was, perhaps, a little discouraging
to see how very much relieved and
refreshed she was in her freedom that
she did not even hanker after her lost
diamonds, and the riches and luxuries
that had once been so desirable and
so precious ; but Mrs. Eeade, as washer
custom, looked below the surface
of things, and found her compensations.


That the girl had recovered her
balance, so to speak, and was in sound
health, mentally and physically, was of
the first importance in this sensible

young woman's view of the case ; and
her eager friendliness to Mr. Kingston
whenever she met him  eager in proportion
to the modesty of his demands
of course, and sometimes warm
with impulsive tenderness such as she
had never voluntarily manifested in
the days of her engagement  seemed to
foreshadow the most hopeful possibilities.
Indeed, if Mr. Kingston behaved
well, Rachel, apart from her
specific misdemeanour, behaved even
better.

Mrs. Hardy, outwardly conforming to
her daughter's scheme, would not, or
could not, disguise her resentment at
the failure of the original enterprise,
and visited it upon the girl, as perhaps
was natural, more roughly than she
would have done had Rachel been her

own child or less deeply indebted to
her.

She was ostentatiously cold and indifferent,
or she was sarcastic, and harsh,
and rude ; she was rigorous to the
verge of tyranny in her determination
to allow no other man the smallest
opportunity for improving the occasion
in the manner that Mr. Kingston had
indicated  withdrawing her niece from
all the gay assemblies where she
had hitherto disported herself with
so much enjoyment and eclat, and
keeping her to a petty routine of
study and household duties that was
made as dull and irksome as
possible.

Yet Rachel, always so sensitive to
both kindness and unkindness, and as
much hurt by a snub as she would

have been by a blow, took it all with
the sweetest patience and temper.

She devoted herself to her aunt's
service as she never had done before,
compassing the sombre woman with
every possible delicate attention that
tact and thoughtfulness could devise ;
and she not only persevered in this
amiable conduct, but kept a certain
placid and gentle brightness about her,
under all discouragements, for weeks
and weeks together.

Mrs. Reade, as a matter of course,
was greatly touched and pleased ; for
it was evident  as far as her sharp
eyes could see that Mr. Dalrymple
was not the source of inspiration ncnv,
seeing that he had been effectually
circumvented on his first attempt to
renew her acquaintance, and had never

been seen or heard of since. It seemed
to the anxious Httle woman that the
girl had only wanted her freedom for
awhile, and that, by and bye, by the
mere drift of the current, she would be
borne back to the arms that were waiting
for her.

Things seemed to be going on so
well that Mrs. Reade, when the gaieties
of the " Cup" season were over, thought
she might venture to leave town for a
few weeks. She wanted very much to
pay a long-deferred visit to Adelonga.

She had not been there since Lucilla
was a bride, and of course she had
not seen the baby. She was also
anxious to find out for herself "the
rights " of the story that her mother
had told her concerning Rachel's conduct
and experiences while sojourning under

her sister's roof, and if possible to
make the acquaintance of some of Mr.
Dalrymple's people.

So, with customary promptitude, she
made her preparations. She sent for
Mr. Kingston and gave him judicious
advice and encouragement to direct and
uphold him in her absence.

Then she interviewed Mrs. Hardy, and
expressed herself so strongly on behalf
of her own views as to what was
right and proper in the management of
Each el's case, that they nearly came
to " words."

And, finally, having fortified the position
to the best of her power, she
sought out Rachel herself, and, in the
privacy of that little chamber at the top
of the house, bade her an affectionate
and reluctant good-bye.

I don't know if my mother has
told yon, dear, that Lucilla wanted me
very much to bring you with me,"
she said, when they were sitting
together by Rachel's window, hand in
hand.

"Did she? Dear Lucilla, how I
should like to see her !" ejaculated
Rachel, but not in the tone of voice
that Mrs. Reade had expected.

And I begged very hard for permission,
but mamma thought it better
not to interrupt your music and painting
lessons again so soon. It is a
great disappointment to you not to
go, isn't it? At first I thought
I would not tell you anything about
it."

"Ah, but I am glad you told me,"
said Rachel; "for I must send a message

to Lucilla to thank her. She
knows how I loved to be at Adelonga 
I think it is the sweetest place in the
wide world."

I wish I could take you," said
Mrs. Eeade; "but "

Oh, no, Beatrice, I cannot go, I
know. Indeed, I would rather not. I
would rather stay with Aunt Elizabeth,
and go on with my lessons."

Mrs. Reade was considerably astonished
and disconcerted by this
evidently genuine sentiment. There
was something in so ready a relinquishment
of the pleasures of Adelonga,
which had always been so great, and
also in the tremulous eagerness with
which the girl put the proposal from
her  a proposal which Mrs. Reade
had feared would be cruelly tantalising

at this time ; but it was not immediately
apparent.

Rachel could not stand the silent
scrutiny of her cousin's brilliant eyes.
Blushing violently, she rose from the
couch on which she had been sitting*,
and rested her arms on the win-downhill,
and looked out upon the
sombre pine trees that stood perfectly
motionless in the golden summer
air.

*' Do you see how that house is
getting on ?" she said, breaking an
awkward pause. '' The walls are simply
rushing up. They will be ready for the
roof directly."

Mrs. Reade stood on tiptoe and
peeped over her shoulder.

I wonder you have the heart to
look at it," she replied.

Oh, Beatrice !*'

'' I do, when you think what a wreck
you have made of all the hopes and
plans that that poor dear man has been
building with it."

He will build some more, and better
ones, by and bye, I hope."

Not he. Men don't do that so
easily at his age."

Oh, yes," she persisted, imploringly,
I think he will, indeed. He did it
very easily with me."

For an exceedingly good reason
because he loved you from the
first. Oh, you ungrateful little monkey,
it's to be hoped you'll die an ugly old
maid!"

That would be better than being
the wife for years and years of a man
I did not love."

'' Rubbish. As if one could have
everything all at once in this world.
 You girls think of nothing but yourselves.
You don't take into account
that it. might be worth while to make
somebody else happy."

How could I make him happy
unless I loved him, Beatrice ?"

'' Oh, don't talk about it. . You have
pleased yourself, I suppose, and he
must do the best he can. He is
terribly miserable as he is, poor
fellow ; but I daresay he'll get over
it."

'ris he miserable now .?" inquired
Rachel anxiously. '' Have you seen
him lately ?"

"I saw him yesterday, and he told
me that his life had no value for him
now that he had lost you, and that he
VOL. II.  . 35

should never live in his house 'unless
you were the mistress of it. I
shouldn't imagine he felt particularly
jolly under those circumstances. However,
it is lio use worrying ourselves
on his account," the little woman added
cheerfully, seeing tears in her cousin's
gentle eyes.

"But I am so sorry for him !"

"that won't help him much, my
dear. And if you are happy, I suppose
 that is all we need care
about."

Oh, no, Beatrice!"

"We haven't time to fret over
other people's troubles," Mrs. Eeade
proceeded, in what Rachel thought an
exceedingly heartless manner ; " life is
too short."

But, Beatrice"

"Now, I can't talk ' about Mr.
Kingston any. more. I have all my
packing to do yet, and I must runaway
and see after it. Good-bye,
dearest cold. Mind you write often.
I wish, you were going with me
I  can't bear . to leave you behind."


Rachel flues; .her arms round her
small" cousin with characteristic fervour.


When do you think you will come
home again?" she inquired tremulously,
almost in a whisper.

"I can't say, dear, exactly."

Before Christmas, won't you ?"

"I think so ; it will all depend on
circumstances."

Oh, do be back by Christmas,"

Rachel pleaded, with an almost tragic

 35-

eagerness. '' It would be dreadful
if Christmas came and you were sofar
away !"

*' Am I so necessary to the festivities
of the season?" laughed Mrs. Reade,
much touched and flattered. " Well,
I'll see what I can do. Suppose I try
and bring Lucilla and the children
back, and make a regular family gathering
of it ?"

'' Oh, if you could r sighed
Rachel.

All the terrors of her time of trial
would be gone, she thought, if she
could have these two faithful cousins
beside her.

So Mrs. Reade went off by the morning
train, tolerably easy in her mind.
She took her big husband with her,
"to keep him," as she said, ' out of

mischief;" and she stayed away much
longer than she had intended todo.
She was. delighted with Aden
and with her sister's companionship.


Ned, also, while being kept in order,
enjoyed himself excessively ; and as
long as he was " good " in the matter
of his besetting sin, his lady and
mistress liked him to enjoy himself.
There were plenty of bush gaieties in
the shape of sporting meetings and
balls, and the time slipped away
rapidly, as time at Adelonga usually
did.

A dance at the Digbys' gave Mrs.
Reade the desired opportunity for
making the acquaintance of Mr. Dairy
male's people, and she learned a few
facts with respect to that gentleman

which, while considerably aggravating
her alarm, tended to modify Bnd dignify .
the impressions of him that her mother
had given her.

Lncilla showed her a fine photograph
of his powerful, melancholy, highbred
face, and she was quite overcome
by it.

''Oh, dear me!" she said to herself,
with . a sort of angry dismay-sit is
no wonder that Each el was infatuated.
If I had had attentions from that
man little as I am given to falling, in
love I think I should have been as
bad as she."

When Christmas came the sisters
were still at Adelonga. Lucilla could
not leave home, and persuaded Beatrice
not to leave her. They contented
themselves with . sending pretty presents

and many loving messages and excuses
to their relatives in Melbourne, and
plunged into a series of festive
entertainments that . lasted for several
weeks.

Then suddenly, as she was dressing
for a ball, Mrs. Reade was startled to
receive a letter from her mother, begging
her to return to town at once,
as E-achel was very ill.

THE GROCJND-WniRL OF THE PEmSHED
LEAVES OF HOPE."

]RS.  READE lost no time in
obeying her mother's summons.
In two days she was back in
Melbourne, and having given ten
minutes to the inspection of her
domestic affairs, and refreshed herself
with tea and bread and butter, she
went on to Toorak in the carriage that
had brought* her from the station,

without even waiting to change her
travelling-dress.

At Toorak she found things in a
most discouraging and deplorable condition
 as they never would have been,
she told herself, had she remained 'in
town.

Mrs. Hardy, who met her in the
hall, and took her to her own room
for elaborate explanations, was herself
a most puzzling and unsatisfactory
feature in the case, for she made it
evident to her daughter's keen perception
that something more had
happened than was accounted for in
her rather disconnected narrative, and
that she did not intend to disclose
what it was.

There was a touch of nervous recklessness
and defiance ti the way she



spoke of Rashers illness as if the
poor child  had crowned a systematic
series of misdemeanours by falling ill
on purpose  and of her hearty regret
that she had ever had anything to do
with  such a perverse and ungrateful
girl, which conveyed to Mrs. Reade
the impression that her cousin had in
some way been persecuted, or had
at any rate, been subjected to more
heroic treatment than her own judgment
and advice had sanctioned.

Under such circumstances it . was,
perhaps, natural that her mother
should be somewhat reserved, since
to be fully confidential wild be to
confess that she had made mistakes ;
but this sudden reversal of old habits,
occurring at this important crisis in
the family fortunes, was a serious.

aggravation of the already sufficient
difficulties that the little woman had to
deal with.

What . complicated  her task still
further was. the discovery .that Mr.
Kingston was again a frequent visitor
at the house, and a strong suspicion
that he was cognisant of those unauthorised
measures  whatever they
were  which she was not to hear of.
The only thing she could hope for
was that Rachel would make a clean
breast of all her secrets.

And if she trusts me, I will
stand her friend against them all,"
declared the baffled conspirator to
herself, as she sat and listened to her
mother's tangled story.

It appeared that Rachel's ' first signs
of illness had become apparent very

soon after the Reader had left town.
She began to fade in colour and to
fail in appetite, and grew nervous,
flighty, and restless ; and, upon investigation,
it was discovered-that
she had lost the habit of sleeping asa
healthy girl should sleep at night.

The family doctor was called in,
who, amongst other remedies prescribed
a return to horse exercise, which,
since the breaking-off of her engagement,
had been abandoned; and Mr.
Kingston thereupon begged so earnestly
that she would ride Black Agnes
again, that she reluctantly consented
to do so to please him.

Mr. Kingston behaved most delicately,
it was explained, and did not force
himself upon her in her rides. She
always went out with William.

Always," however, turned out to be
only twice, and on both occasions the
carriage had accompanied her with Mr.
Kingston in it.

 Just before Christmas she refused
to ride any more, and she behaved
in the most rude and ill-bred manner
to Mr-kingston. On Christmas Day
she was very aggravating  in what
way did not appear  and Mrs. Hardy
had to "speak" to her; and the result
was that she flew into a violent
passion, and then had a fit of
hysterics, and then fainted dead away,,
and did not come round for nearly
five minutes.

'' I don't recognise Each el in any
of those performances," remarked Mrs.
Reade. " Why did you not send forme
then, mother ?"

Because I thought it was nothing
but a temporary attack. The weather
was sultry  she was full of whims and
fancies. "What could you have done if
you had come ? And she was better
again next day."

"Weir : '

'well, then, when I was doing all
I could to nurse and take care of
her, she went out of a warm room one
night, and rambled about the garden
or somewhere in a heavy dew, and,
got her feet wet. Wasn't it too bad?
I could have shaken her when I
saw her come in, with a face as
white, as ashes, and .chilled to her
very bones !" 

'' She caught cold, I suppose ?."
*' Of course she did. And then she
had a touch of fever  what else was

to be expected? Her pulse was very
high, and she was excited, and
inclined to be" delirious indeed, we had
as much as we could do to manage
her. It did not last long, and it
was really nothing but .the consequences
of her imprudence, the
doctor said  and there waS a little
low kind of fever going about just
now  and he did not think her constitution
was very strong. He says
she will . soon be all right, with care ;
and indeed, the fever is quite allayed
since I wrote to you, and any little
danger that there might  have been
is' over. But she keeps low. She
doesn't seem to gain strength  and
no wonder, considering we can't
get her to eat anything. I am
glad you have come back; perhaps

you will have more influence with
her than I have."

/'I suppose I may go up ?" Mrs.
Reade inquired, after a pause. Her
mother gave her permission readily ; it
was a great surprise and relief to her
to find herself .spared the searching
cross-examination . which she had
rather uneasily looked forward to.

"You had better put on your
bonnet and have a drive," the
young lady proceeded, pausing with
her hand on the door. " It will
do you good, after being in the
house so much. I don't want the
horses taken out, and they will
only scratch holes in the gravel
if they stand here doing nothing.
I am not going away till dinner
time."

Thank sou, my .clear, I think
I  will," said Mrs, Hardy. Mrs.
Reade went upstairs to Rachel's
room, and without knocking, opened
the door . softly.

It was a bright January afternoon,
but the heat of the day
was . over, and a sea breeze was
springing .up. The window was open,
and the chintz curtains softly rustling,
to and fro. There was ' a
magnificent bouquet on a table at the
foot of the bed ; the air was full of
the perfume of roses; a few flies were
buzzing over' a plate of strawberries
get on a chair at Rachel's side.

The invalid was lying on a sofa,
in a white dressing-gown, in an
attitude, of extreme languor, asleep
One hand holding a fan had

VOL. II . '36

dropped beside her; the other was
under her head. Her dark gold
hair was loose and tumbled, and
curling in damp rings on her temples ;
her face was flushed and thin ; * there
were hollows and shadows under the
tired closed eyes She looked as if
she had been ill for months.

Mrs. Reade, examining her attentively
as she knelt by the sofa,
was deeply shocked and concerned.
Never would she have gone away
to Adelonga if she could have foreseen
this ! And never should the
poor little thing be harried and
worried, as she had evidently been,
again, if she had any power to
prevent it  no, not though twenty
Mr. Kingston and all their twenty
fortunes were at stake.

A mosquito settled upon the girl's

white arm, and the light brush of the

finger that removed it wakened her.

She drew a deep breath, and opened

ber eyes languidly; then seeing her

visitor, she stared at her for a

second in a dazed and startled

way; and then to Mrs. Reade's

great embarrassment and distress,

she suddenly flung herself into her

arms, and broke into the wildest

weeping. . '

"Now, Rachel! sow, my dearest
child"

But it would have been as hopeless
to try and stop the Falls ' of Niagara
as this tide of-passion at the flood ;
seeing which, Mrs. Reade waited for
the ebb in silence. By the time it
came" the girl was completely exhausted ;

162

she seemed to have the merest fragment
of strength.

Now," said Beatrice, when she had
sponged her face and hands and otherwise
taken steps to revive and soothe
her, "now tell me what all this is
about. I know you. are in some great
trouble, and I have come home on purpose
to help you."

''No one can help me !" Rachel cried
despairingly, tears rushing afresh into
her hot eyes. '

Oh, nonsense. Just tell me what
is the matter, and see if I can't.
Are they trying to make you marry
Mr. Kingston? Because I can soon
send him about his business."

No ; Mr. Kingston is very kind
oiow. He sends me flowers every day.
He does not worry me. He is very

considerate and thoughtful. For I think
he  knows."

Well, and now I want to know.
Is it about  someone else ? Is it about
Mr. Dalrymple?"

"Who told you?" the girl demanded,
with sharp entreaty. " Oh, Beatrice,
what have you heard? Did Mrs. Digby
tell you anything about him ? Is hein
Queensland ? Is he alive ? What is
he doing?"

Mrs. Reade replied that she had
heard nothing of Mr. Dalrymple beyond the
fact that he was believed to be in
Queensland, and doing well.

' If he had. lot been, they must
have known," said Rachel. " Oh, my
love, if I could see you for myself
just once;"

She began tory again, naore bitterly

than before, and to wring her hands.
There was a fierce excitement in her
grief and despair that for a moment
stunned the Httle woman who had
never known what it was to be in
love.

And then Rachel told all the* story
of her clandestine engagement, as the
reader already knows it, without any
reservations. The denoioeraent was exactly
what Mrs. Eeade expected  "And
he never came !"

Poor little thing !" she ejaculated
pitifully.

*' I was as certain that he would
come as that Christmas would come,"
said Rachel, reckless in her confessions
now that she had begun to open her
heart. " And there was a strange gentleman
here, and he was shut up a

long time with Aunt Elizabeth, and I
thought it was he"

Are you sure it was not he ?"

Quite sure. "When he was going
away I ran out into the garden and
watched for him ; he was an ugly little
man. And if it had been Eoden, and
he had wanted to see me, he would not
have allowed himself to be sent away." 

That would have depended on
mamma ; wouldn't it ?" 

"Oh, no. He would never have let
her send him away ; and Aunt Elizabeth
says, solemnly, that he never came'"

You told her, about him then ?" asked
Mrs Reade. 

Beatrice, I was nearly mad  I don't
know what I said. She was very
angry  she always hated him. But I
did not care  I was too miserable to

care. And I made lier swear that he
had never come; and now  it is nearly
February  now I know he didn't. I
don't want anybody to tell me."

Mrs. Eeade pat all these revelations
into her mental crucible, and in a few
seconds she had the product ready.  On
presenting it to Rachel, wrapped up
in the gentlest language, it came to this
simply  that "it was always the way
with mqjCL of that kind."

He is not like other men," said
Rachel. *' I do not blame him. I
have thought of it, over and over andover,
every night and every day, and
I know why it was. I ran after Jim,
Beatrice I took him before he offered
himself to me  I had only, seen him
once or twice when I showed him I
loved him, and made him think I wanted

him lie did nat ask me to be his
wife until I had given myself to hips
already! I did not think of it then,
but I see it clearly now. I dragged
him into it  I gave him no choice.
And now he is away, and he thinks
.about it, and he knows I am not
enough for* him. How should I be
enough  J. for such a man as that ?
Oh, that happy woman, who died in his
arms ! Oh, how I wish I had been she !"

' Well," said Mrs. Reade, * after a
pause, trying to speak cheerfully, but
feeling profoundly disheartened; "you
ought not to have had anything to do
with lovers and marriages at your time
of life, and you. must just give up
thinking of such things until  you are
older and wiser."

''I shall never give Mm up," said.

Rachel quietly ;" never, if I live to bea.
hundred I have told Aunt Elizabeth
 I told her to tell Mr. Kingston: 
that I shall never love any other man.
It would be impossible, after loving
him. When I am well I shall ask her
to let me go out and be a governess,
and earn my own living. I don't want"
to be rich, I want to be. .poor, like
him. And some day, perhaps, I may
see him again, and be able to do
something for him  if it isn't till he is
an old, old man, I don't care. If only
God lets him live and lets me live, so
that we are both in the world together
 I'll take my chance of the rest.
Butbut," and she turned her head
from side to side, and began to tremble
and cry in a weak, hysterical
abandonment of all self-command, "if I

have to wait for years and years, without
a sight of his face or a sound of
his voice, how shall I be able to live?
The longing for him will kill me I"

Mrs. Eeade went away when her
carriage returned, more humble-minded
than she had been in her life. She
wanted very much to stay and nurse
her cousin until she was better, but
she could not do that, because she could
not trust iced to keep house and keep
sober by himself ; so she set off to seethe
doctor to get a confidential report
of the " case," meaning to intimate her
suspicions that there was a touch of
fever on the brain, and to gain his
sanction to a scheme for removing the
invalid to her own cheerful abode at
South Yarra as soon as she became
moderately convalescent.

RACHEL ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF Marriage.

Probably no girl of nineteen
probably no man or woman
of any age  ever died of a
broken heart, unless when that complaint
was complicated and aggravated
by the presence of physical disease of
some sort.

Rachel's- constitution was sound, albeit
her nervous organisation was extremely
delicate, and she did not die, neither
under this bitter first blow nor later

on, when she had still sharper  provocations.


A little tender petting and coddling
sat the hands of her cousin Beatrice, who
was now her devoted ally and friend,
did more to restore her than ' all the
doctor's medicines and all  her aunt's
jellies and broths.

The very talking of her troubles eased
and. soothed her, and gave her a-
sense of refreshment and rest, and
though Beatrice offered her no encouragement*
on Mr. Dalrymple's behalf 
and indeed hinted pretty broadly that
the terrible thing which had happened
was an inevitable sequel and corrective
to a lapse of reason that partook of
the character of temporary insanity, to
say the least of it  she was heartily
if not demonstratively sympathetic.

Within a fortnight of her cousin's
return she reached that stage of convalescence
which made the removal to
South Yarra justifiable, and in the"
doctor's opinion expedient.

Mrs. Eeade had great difficulty in
carrying out "this little enterprise. Her
mother had never shown herself so impracticable.


She was determined not to let Rachel
out of her sight, she said; and she
stuck to that determination against
many artful manoeuvres so steadily that
the powerful small woman, little accustomed
to be thwarted, and still less
to own to it, nearly made up
her mind to confess, herself beaten,
and to break the disappointment to
Rachel.

Mrs. Hardy, however, relented in a

sudden and unexpected manner. Lie
received a consignment of furniture and
bric-a-hrac from her travelling daughter,
together with most interesting and bewildering
advices.

Laura wrote to say that the Toorak
House, if it had any respect for itself,
must immediately get rid of its pier-glasses,
its whitewash, and its aniline
colours ; and poor Mrs. Hardy, who
had ever walked with the complacent
dignity of a priestess and oracle in the
sacred regions of household art, was
too much excited and disturbed by the
humiliating discovery that she was old-fashioned
and behind the times, and
'by her agonising desire to recover
her proper position, to pay the customary
. attention even to Rachel's
business.

While sie was absorbed in beginning
the mighty task of re-adjusting her
ideas of taste and the. details of her
domestic environment, which, after a
few years of painful struggle with  the
impracticabilities of Eastlake mediae-valise,
was to .result in the existing
combination of Chippendale and the
Japanese, she felt that it would be a
relief to divest herself of superfluous cares.

So she laid her daughter under solemn
obligations to protect Rachel's interests
and the honour of the family, and
allowed her to take the invalid away
with her for a week or two, that
so she might give, her undivided
attention to the choice of new coverings*
for the drawing-room furniture, and the
question what should be done to the
ceiling.

The two young women were very
grateful for the chance which set them
free to follow their own devices. Mrs.
Reade brought her new brougham 
a propitiatory offering from Ned after
he had scandalously disgraced himself
by going to a public dinner and coming
home in a dishevelled condition at noon
next day  and conveyed her charge to
South Yarra in a nest of soft cushions,
and laid her on a pillowy sofa in the
brightest of homely boudoirs, where
they discussed the situation and afternoon
tea with much content and cheerfulness.


Rachel was strangely peaceful and
amiable at this time. She puzzled her
companion excessively. She had, indeed,
a sort of exalted transcendentalism about
her that was almost aggravating to that
VOL. II. 37

practical and most unsentimental person.
Her way of moralising upon love and
lovers, after such an experience as she
had had, was very naive and touching,
but eminently preposterous, Mrs. Reade
considered  and she did not at all mind
saying so.

A lover who is unfaithful does the
deadliest dishonour that is possible to
love, in my opinion," said she, with her
customary air of decision. " To break
any pledge is bad enough, but to
break that pledge ought to disqualify a
man from ever again calling himself a
man."

I do not think there should be any
pledges in love, either given or asked
for," said Rachel softly. " Love is nota
thing to be tied and bound. Fancy a
man feeling that he had to keep a

promise if he did not wish to do it !
And, oh ! fancy a woman letting him 
being deceived into letting him make a
sacrifice for her ! It would be an outrage
and a degradation to both of them. I
think Rodenn  Mr. Dalrymple  is above
that, Beatrice."

From all she had heard, Mrs. Reade
was decidedly disposed to think so
too.

'' He says that they are a curse upon
people's lives  those engagements that
are kept," continued Rachel, looking
solemnly out of the window with her
pensive eyes.

'' Did he tell you that ? Dear me,
he must be a most extraordinary man."

'' I understand it perfectly  I know
what he means. When we love one
another we are not responsible ; 



thing in us makes us do it. When we
leave off loving  when we get dissatisfied
we can't help it either. It is nature
that tells us to do the one as well as
the other ; and nature should be obeyed,
Rodenn says."

Mrs. Reade made no comment upon
this, but thought to herself that it was a
remarkably wise provision of nature 
under the circumstances  that her devotee
was endowed with the courage of his convictions.


It is very hard for me now, but
it is the truest kindness and gentleness
on his part," the girl went on, with a
tremor in her quiet voice. "He knows
we understand each other better than
any one else can do. I think some
day he will come and tell me all
about it  when he thinks I can bear

it ; how he could not help it ; that that
other woman's memory was more to
him than any new love a few days
old could be, and how he was true
to her and to himself, and to me, not
to wrong any of us any further to gratify
my foolishness. It will be something
of that sort, I know ; it will be
nothing that is a disgrace to him.
Ah, Beatrice, you think I am talking
childish nonsense, I see it in your
face."

I certainly do, my dear. I think you
are fully qualified for admission into the
Yarra Bend, if you wish for the candid
truth."

No ; you don't know him, and T do.
I am puzzled, I don't deny that I am
puzzled a little ; but I trust him. He
may do what he likes ; I shall never

think that he will do anything wrong.
Some day it will be explained, and I
shall see that he was right. I shall
love him the more for not being afraid
to break off with me when he felt it
was a mistake. Under any circumstances
I love him too well not to be
thankful I am spared the misery of
seeing him suffer from a irksome marriage
that could not satisfy him. And
love  as he and I understand love 
would be degraded by vulgar efforts to
keep it under lock and key."

I don't know whether it occurs to
you," remarked Beatrice, with her head
on one side ; '* but it is a very dangerous
doctrine that you and Mr. Dalrymple
seem to believe in. Logically worked
out, it leads  goodness ' knows where it
doesn't lead to."

The blood flew over the girl's pale
face. She was the most sensitively
delicate, the most maidenly, of girls;
and she scented a meaning in her cousin's
words that shocked her terribly.

' I am sure that cannot be," she
said, with a majestic gentleness that
was full of severe reproach.

You don't imply that husbands and
wives, when they are tired of each
other  or even when only one is tired
are at liberty to make fresh combinations
?"

You knoio I am not alluding to
married people, Beatrice. They are like
nuns who have taken the veil; they
have nothing to do with  with  such
things as we have been speaking of."

Oh, indeed haven't they?" 

They are in a sacred place. They

are out of the common world  out of
the arena, so to speak. The have
taken their prizes, and gone to sit with
the spectators. Even if they do marry
wrongly, and do not love each other
afterwards, in the fullest way, after
such a dedication as they have
made  with such ties and confidences,
and intimacies between them, so sacred,
and so close, and so delicate, and soso
 oh, Beatrice, don't look at me
like that ! You know what I mean."
I am trying to follow you, dear."
You are married yourself, and you
know how it is better than I do. Yet
I know, too. If I were married  if I

were Eoden's wife "

'' You would lie down at his feet
and let him clean his boots on you, if
there did not happen to be a door-mat

handy  oli, yes, T quite understand
that

I would never make demands upon
him that he should love me always,"
the girl proceeded, with a gentle
solemnity that this kind of flippant
witticism could not discompose. '' I
would never even ask him if he loved
me. It would seem to me a coarse and
insulting question, and it would tempt
him to doubt whether he did. If he
went away from me, I would never say
to him, 'Write to me often  write me
long letters.' It is so stupid of people
to do that ! Of course, if he wanted
to, he would; and if he did it because
he was asked, his letters would be valueless,
and worse. He should never have
to think of me as a mortgage on his
life and his happiness  he should do

as he liked  he should love me as he
liked. And if ever he left off loving
me, I should know he could not help
it  I should not blame him  I should
not ask him why. I should feel it ina
moment  I am sure, long before he
did  as one feels a chill in the air
when the sun goes in, even if one's
eyes are shut; but I should never say
a word about it. And yet  "

"And yet it would never occur to
him, you think, to provide himself with
a more congenial companion ?

Beatrice, I cannot talk to you, if
you make those suggestions."

I am only making your own suggestions,
my dear. You said it was a
degradation to love to keep it under
lock and key."

'rand I said I was not speaking of

married people. You hnoio there is
something  whole worlds of things 
besides love to be considered in their case."

"Married people are just as human
as single people  and so, for the matter
of that, are nuns who have taken the
veil, I suppose. Vows, if I understand
you rightly, are immoral; and the
dictates of nature should be obeyed.
Nature is uncommonly likely to dictate
to man who is not in love with his
wife that there might possibly exist a
more desirable woman."

'' I don't know how to explain
myself," said Rachel, who felt herself
in a distressing entanglement, and yet
was conscious that her principles were
being utterly misconstrued; 'but I
know that that  what you allude to 
would be an impossibility."

"Well, I daresay it would," said Mrs.
Eeade, after a pause. She was suddenly
struck with the impropriety of
insisting upon strict logic in the discussion
of these delicate matters, all
things considered. Yet she was not
quite content to leave off at this point.

'' Put Mr. Dairy male aside, Rachel.
Suppose you were yourself married, not
to him, but to someone you did not
particularly care for?"

'' That could never be," the girl replied
quickly.

Oh, I don't know. It was very
nearly being, I may take leave to remind
you. None of us can forsee what will
happen, and 'never' is a ridiculous word
for a child like you to use. You will
not live an old maid for fifty or sixty
years because you are disappointed ina

lover whom you have known for a
few days  don't you believe it."

"I will make no vows," said Eacliel
with a faint smile ; " but I express to
you my sincere conviction that I shall
never marry anybody. If T do  and I
can't say I wish to be an old maid  I
shall tell the person, whoever he is, all
about Rodenn, frankly."

Of course you will. And very
probably he will like you the better for
that frankness, and be quite willing to
take you on your own terms. But
then, suppose after years of married
life Mr. Dalrymple turned up again, and
you found you felt towards him as you
do now  what then ?"

"What then?" repeated the girl,
much disturbed and a little affronted ;
*' I should not recognise that I felt so."

'' But suppose  for the sake of argument
 that you could not help yourself ?"

I hope 1 could help it, Beatrice. I
should not allow him to remind me of
the past."

"Would not the past suggest itself
sufficiently ? Ah, my dear, he is a very
strong man ! And you are as weak as
well, we needn't say anything about
that. If he wanted your love back, and
you had it in your heart "

"If he did," interposed Rachel; "but
I know he never would  I should love
him no more."

Would that be in accordance with
the terms of your philosophy ?"

Yes, it would. For nature makes
us with many capacities. Some of them
counteract the others. Don't talk of these
things any more, Beatrice  I don't like it."

< Very well, dear ; I won't."

The little lady got up from her seaton
the floor, opened a window, put the
teacups on the table, and asked her
cousin if she had seen the beautiful
Persian tiles that Mr. Kingston had
just had sent out to hin for one of
the dados in the new house.

Rachel responded absently, gazed fora
little while in silence upon the sleepy
garden full of flowers and humming
bees, and as Mrs. Reade had expected,
returned herself to the abandoned topic.

"At any rate," she said thoughtfully,
'' there is one thing I would always do.
I would tell the truth. I would never
have secrets. I would sooner do the
wrongest thing, the wickedest crime,
than hide it. If I feel things in my
heart  well, my husband, if I have one.

shall know all that I know. And I
will never do anything that he  that the
whole world  may not see."

Does that seem to you so easy ?'*
inquired Beatrice, settling a top-heavy
rosebud in a slender Venetian vase.
"Did you never have any secrets that
you were afraid to tell'*

The girl was silent for several minutes.
She was crimson to the throat, and her
face was turned away from her companion.

I will do what is sure to be right
and  safe," she said at last, falteringly;
I will never marry anybody, if I do
not marry Rodenn."

CHAPTER I.

A P ARABLE.

T was about a month after the
foregoing conversation took
place, that Melbourne society
was fluttered by a rumour that the
engagement between Mr. Kingston and
Miss Fetherstonhaugh, which had been
unaccountably broken off, was "on"
again, and that the long-delayed wedding
was to take place immediately. Rumour

VOL. III.



for once in the way, was perfectly
correct.

People went to call at Toorak, and
found the aunt serene and radiant, and
the bride-elect wearing all the honours
of her position  not shyly as of yore,
but with a quiet candour and dignified
self-possession that was not generally considered
becoming under the circumstances.

It was thought that a little humility
would be proper in a young person who
was going to enjoy such altogether undeserved
good fortune.

It happened while she was staying at
South Yarra. Hoi it happened nobody
quite knew. Gossip attributed it to
Mrs. Reade's manoeuvres ; but Mrs.
Head, far from encouraging anything
of the sort, set herself steadily against
it, and warned Mr. Kingston of probable

consequences in the most terse and
trenchant manner (she had taken a very
different view of the situation since, her
return from Adelonga).

Gossip likewise attributed it to the
seductions of the new house, which was
beginning to shadow forth in Palladio-gingerbread
of the most ambitious
pattern, the magnificence of the establishment
that was to be ; but gossip
was equally misinformed in this respect.

Rachel was as ready as ever to admire
the house, and the beautiful tiles, and
carvings, and hangings, and upholstery,
that were constantly being designed and
produced for its adornment ; she fully
understood how much they represented
for whoever was to possess and enjoy
them. But they had not a feather-weight
of value in her eyes as compared

38-2

with the happiness she had hoped for
and lost ; they did not suggest the idea
of compensation or consolation in even
a slight degree. The fact was that
Mr. Kingston was determined to have her.

Of late he had seemed  not to Rachel,
but to Mrs. Reade  to have a sort of
half-sullen doggedness in his determination,
indicating that he was as much bent
upon winning the game as upon winning
the stakes  that he meant, before all
things, not to be beaten in the enterprise
upon which he had set his heart.

And in this frame of mind he waited
upon opportunity ; and in the end, opportunity,
as so often happens in such
cases, served him.

One day Beatrice and her husband
went out of town to lunch, and Rachel
had a long, lonely afternoon. It came

on to rain, and it was grey and chilly.
Dull weather always sent her spirits
down several degrees below the normal
temperature, and just now she was
morbidly sensitive to its influence.

If Beatrice had been at home there
would have been a fire in no time,
summer though it was ; in her absence
Rachel did not like to take upon herself
to order one. She lay on a sofa
with a shawl over her feet, and listened
to the rain pattering on the window,
and felt cold, and dismal, and deserted.

At five o'clock she was pining for
her tea, and thinking it had been forgotten,
rang for it ; and the smart young
parlour-maid, interrupted in an interesting
tete-astute with the next door coachman,
and blessed with few opportunities for
the indulgence of a naturally restive

temper, brought it in with a protesting
nonchalance, a teapotful of nasty liquid,
made with water that had not boiled,
and a couple of slices of bread and
butter that would have charmed a
hungry schoolboy  such as would never
have been presented to the mistress
of the house, as Rachel well knew.

This small indignity, so very small as it
was, greatly aggravated the vague sense of
desolation and orphanhood  the feeling
that she was a person of no consequence
to anybody  which possessed her just
now. And while she was in the lowest
depths of despondency, in the deepest
indigo of blues, Mr. Kingston calling,
discovered her solitude and came in,
tenderly deferential, full of solicitude
for her health and comfort, stooping
from his higher sphere of social importance

to pay homage to her still in
her forlorn insignificance.

For the space of half-an-hoiir perhaps
she felt that it would be good to be
married to somebody  to anybody  who
would love and take care of her, and
make the servants treat her with proper
respect ; and a mere chance enabled Mr.
Kingston to take advantage of that accident.

Looking back afterwards she never
could understand how it was that she
had felt disposed to re-accept him ; but
the causes were as distinct as causes
usually are. Badly-made tea, and the
want of a fire in dull weather are,
amongst the multifarious factors of
human destiny, greatly underrated.

Having said the fatal " yes "  or,
rather, having failed at the proper
moment to say '' no," which Mr. Kingston

justly took to mean the same thing 
Rachel was allowed no more opportunities
for what her aunt called 'shilly-shallying."

The day of the marriage was fixed
at once, and the preparations for her
trousseau simultaneously set on foot.

The girl had hardly come to realise
the extraordinary thing that she had
done when she found herself being
measured for all sorts of wearing apparel,
and consulted about the arrangements
for her honeymoon tour. Then she set
herself to do her duty in the state of life
to which she imagined herself " called,"
with a kind of hopeless resignation. She
recognised the fact that this second
mistake was not revocable like the first ;
and therefore she understood that it was
not to be considered a mistake.

All her life and energy now had to

be dedicated to the task of making it
justifiable to lier own conscience and in
the eyes of all men.

And so she was sweet and gentle to
her affianced husband, promising him
that, though she could not love him
first and best, if he was content to have
her as she was (and he assured her he
was quite content), she would do all
in her power to prove herself a good
and true wife to him ; and she was
tractable and obedient in the hands of
her aunt, and ready to fall in with all
the arrangements that were made for her.

But, as the wedding-day drew near,
the dread of it showed itself to Mrs.
Reade, if to no one else, in the dumb
eloquence of the sensitive, truth-telling
face. That little person who had such
a talent for managing, stood aside at

this crisis, and did not intermeddle with
the strange course of events.

In none of the affairs that she had
promoted and directed and brought to
successful terminations, had she taken
such a deep and painful interest as
she now felt in this, which she had been
powerless to control; but, for the first
time in her life, she was afraid to speak
to her young cousin of the thoughts
that both their minds were full of,
lest she might be called upon to advise
where she found it was impossible to
decide what was for the best, and only
waited helplessly upon Fate, like an
ordinary incapable woman.

On the night before the wedding  a
soft, bright, early autumn night 
Rachel gave her a distinct intimation
if she had wanted it, that the marriage

however it might turn out eventually,
was by no means undertaken as marriages
should be.

The girl stole away from the drawing-room
while the others were temporarily
absorbed in the preparations that were
going on for the great ceremonial, and
Mrs. Reade, hunting for her anxiously,
found her standing in the moonlight
by the kitchen-garden gate.

Looking at that house again !" the
little woman exclaimed. '' hy, you
must know every stick and stone by
heart. I never miss you that I don't
find you here."

I am like our poor Jenny and the
tank," said Rachel, gazing still at the
imposing pile before her, sharply black
and white against the soft light of the sky.

Who is Jenny, may I ask ?"

"A dear cat we used to have. She
fell into a deep tank one day when
father and I were not at home, and
for two days she was struggling at
the edge of the water clinging to a bit
of brickwork, and no one came to help
her. Some men heard her cries, but
did not know where she was. As soon
as we came home, of course I found it
all out ; and I got a large bough of
wattle and lowered it down, and so she
was saved when she was very nearly
gone. Oh, poor thing, what a state
she was in ! I sat up with her all night.
But she never got over it. She was
not exactly mad, but she was never in
her right mind afterwards."

'well?" said Mrs. Eeade who was
greatly mystified. "I can't see the
drift of your allegory so far."

No ; I was going to tell you. Ever
after this happened, we had to keep a
constant watch upon her to prevent her
from throwing herself into the tank
again. If she heard the sound of the
lid being moved, she would rush to it
in a sort of frenzy. A bricklayer was
doing something to it one day, and we
had to lock her up, she was in such a
frantic state. She would be gentle and
quiet at other times, but as soon as
she thought the lid was being opened,
she got quite mad to go to it. And
at last a new servant, who did not know
of this, left the lid off one day, and
poor Jenny seized her chance, and
jumped in and drowned herself."

And that is your well, you mean ?"
said Mrs. Reade, pointing to the house.
And you are immolating yourself, like

Jenny ? Oh, Rachel, what are you talking
about !"

'' I am talking nonsense, I know,"
said Rachel, with an impressive air of
artificial composure ; " but somehow
Jenny happened to come into my head.
Beatrice, do you know I have been
thinking of something."

'' Of what? Oh, dear me,. T wish to
goodness you would think like a sensible
girl, who knew her own mind sometimes."


I have been thinking what I ought
to do. I ought to just put on my hat
and jacket and run away. I could goto
a friend, a poor widow, who used to
be very kind to me in the old dajs, and
she would let me stay with her until I
could get a situation. 'No, don't scold
me  it is ten o'clock, isn't it ? It is

too late for a gii-l to be out at night
alone. I can do it, if I would."

'' And would you, indeed if you could ?"
demanded Mrs. Reade, holding her by
her wrists and looking imploringly into
her face. '' Do you really mean that
you have a mind to do such a thing,
Rachel ?"

Rachel was silent for a few seconds
and then she began to cry bitterly.

Oh, I don't know I don't know !"
she said, turning her head wildly from
side to side. '' Sometimes I feel one
way and sometimes another. I want
somebody  somebody strong, like Rod en
to tell me what it is right to do !"

For a moment Mrs. Reade weighed
the merits of the proposition, and all
that lay against it, with as near an approach
to impartial judgment as true

friendship and human fallibility allowed.
And the thought of Rachel's weakness
of purpose and inability to take care of
herself, and of Mr. Dalrymple's traditional
character, turned the scale.

You cannot go back 7ioiv,' she said.
'' My darling, you have doubly given
yourself to Mr. Kingston, and you must
try to make yourself happy with him 
much can be done by trying, if you will
only make up your mind !"

It was the last chance that Rachel
had, and she accepted the fate that
deprived her of it with characteristic
meekness. -

*' Yes, I will try," she said, wiping
her eyes. " It is too late to go back now."

WHEN YULE IS COLD.

ACHEL, when she did at last
get married, had a very
stately wedding, if that was
any comfort to her. The weather
was beautiful, to begin with ; a lovelier
autumn morning: even Australia

could not have furnished, to bean



omen of good luck for the future
years.

Each of the eight young Melbourne

VOL III.



belles who had been invited to assist
at the interesting ceremony took
care to point out the significance
of sunshine and a cloudless sky
when offering their congratulations
to the bride and to the bridegroom
also.

The bridegroom on this occasion
by no means filled the humble office
which tradition and custom assigned
to him. There was not a bridesmaid
of them all who did not feel that she
was much more Mr. Kingston's bridesmaid
than Mrs. Kingston's.

Not only were they better acquainted
and on more friendly terms generally
with him than with her, but he had
far more to say to them, and practically
far more to do with them,
in the course of the day and in the

discharge of his and their official
duties.

He was the prince of bridegrooms,
indeed. He had made magnificent
settlements upon his wife (though the
credit of that really belonged to Mr.
Hardy, who, for once in a way, had
to be reckoned with in the progress of
these arrangements) ; and his wedding
presents were on an equally noble
scale.

The bridesmaids' bracelets were solid
evidences of his worth in every sense
of the term, and inasmuch as each
bracelet slightly differed from the rest,
though all were equally costly, of the
excellence of his taste and tact. They
were valued thereafter by their respective
recipients rather as parting
keepsakes from their bachelor friend

892

than as mementoes of his auspicious
marriage.

And the diamond necklace that was
his special wedding-day gift to his
bride, and which lay just under the
ruffled lace encircling her white throat
a dazzling ring of shifting lights
and colours  a magnet to the eyes
of all spectators  was worthy to have
been a gift from Solomon to the Queen
of Sheba.

There was not a servant in the
house, nor near it, who did not receive
some token of the princely fashion in
which he improved this great occasion,
and who did not participate in the
general impression that he more than
rivalled, in popularity and importance,
the beautiful young lady whom he had
won.

Of the company, all were charmed
with his gaiety, his affability, and his
delightful sang-froid. He was never
for a moment embarrassed. He overflowed
with airy courtesies, not only
to his bride, but to all her maids and
friends.

He made a brilliant speech, that
exactly hit the happy medium between
tearful pathos and unfeeling jocularity,
and that was full of well-bred witticisms,
provocative of gentle, well-bred
laughter. He was, in short, all
that a bridegroom ought to be, and
so very seldom is. He covered himself
with honour.

E-achel, on the contrary, seemed to
have been mesmerised into temporary
lifelessness. It was expected that she
would be shy and fluttered, and bathed

in blushes ; but she was not agitated
at all, and she did not blush at all.
She bore herself generally with a
statuesque composure that was thought
by some to be very dignified, and by
others very wooden and stupid, and
that was a little depressing to witness
from either point of view. From the
beginning of the day she wore this
unnatural calmness.

Mrs. Eeade had been in terror lest
she should give way to unbecoming
excitement at some stage of the ceremonies,
and was prepared to combat
the first symptoms of hysteria with such
material and moral remedies as were
most likely to be efficacious.

She had strictly enjoined Lucilla,
who had brought the baby to the
wedding, not to let that irresistible

child appear upon any account, and
bidden her restrict herself to the most
perfunctory caresses until the public
ordeal was over. But long ere this
point was reached the little woman
was lonmnof to see some sirens of the
emotional weakness that she had deprecated,
and there were none.

The bride was as beautiful as a
sculptor's ideal, but as cold as the
marble which dimly embodies it. She
had apparently nerved herself for a
sacrificial rite, or else the greatness
of lier suffering had numbed her ;
or she was calm with resignation and
despair.

I wish," said Mrs. Reade to herself,
in the middle of the marriage service,
I wish I had stopped it last night. I
have made a mistake."

But as this thought occurred to
her, she was standing  a splendid little
figure in ruby velvet and antique lace
in the midst of scores of other
splendid figures, a helpless witness to
the irrevocable consummation of her
mistake, which after all was less hers
than anybody's.

Rachel had given her '' troth " to her
husband, and he was putting the ring
that was the sign and seal of it  the
token and pledge of the solemn vow
and covenant betwixt them made  upon
her finger.

When the breakfast was over, that
domestic pendant to the religious
ceremony having " gone off " with
great success, Mrs. Kingston, in due
course, retired to put on her travelling
dress.

The bridesmaids proper were dispensed
with, at this stage, and the two
married cousins went upstairs with the
bride.

It was Beatrice now who was tender
and caressing ; Lucilla, who did not
see very far below the surface of anything,
and was delighted with the
pomp and circumstance of this new
alliance in the family, and charmed, like
all happy matrons, to welcome a newcomer
into the matrimonial ranks, overflowed
with unwonted gaiety.

Now we are all married !'' she
exclaimed, sinking upon a sofa in
Rachel's room, and looking very fair and
young as if marriage had thoroughly
agreed with her in a pale blue French
dress of the highest fashion. " And
we have all married so well, haven't

we ? And we have all got such good
husbands. Oh, how nice it will be
when Rachel and Laura come back
and begin housekeeping ! John is going
to let me have a house in town, too,
as soon as Isabel and Bruce come
home, so that we shall be down for
part of the year ; and then what a
cosy little family circle we shall make !
But Rachel will be at the head of us
all. Ah, dear child, you will know now
how nice it is to be a married woman
to have your own husband with you
always  such a delightful, attentive
husband, too, as I know he will be 
and your own home  such a beautiful

home "

"You lock up her diamonds, Lucilla,"
Mrs. Reade interrupted, handing the
starry necklace to her sister. " And,

Rachel, dear, don't stand and tire
yourself. Sit down, and let me dress
you."

Rachel, when her bridal lace and
satin had been taken off, sat down to
be sponged and brushed, and to have
her travelling boots laced up.

Beatrice performed her lady's-maid
offices in silence, while Lucilla handed
her what she wanted, and pleasantly
chatted on ; and when all was done,
and the bride, in russet homespun, was
ready for her departure, there were a
few words whispered that Mrs. Thornley
did not hear.

*' My darling, you said you would try."

*' Yes, Beatrice, dear; yes, I am
trying."

You are not finding it very hard 
too hard  are you."

It will be easier in a little
while."

If you make an effort, Rachel  if
you make up your mind  if you are
kind and good to your husband, and
try to keep him straight, and to make
his home happy "

'* Yes, dear; yes. I am going todo
all I can. But to-day I can only
feel that I have lost  quite lost  Rodenn.
I feel now as if he were dead. Even
the memory of him I must not comfort
myself with any more. That is what
I feel hard. But I am trying to get
over it. I have promised Mr. Kingston
Graham  all those solemn promises,
and I must keep them  I will. It is
only at first that I don't know how
to bear it ; but it will be easier by-and-bye.
We must not talk about it,

Beatrice; it is wrong to talk about it
now. And, oh ! I do so dread that I
shall break down."

She did break down at last. When
she descended the staircase into the
hall she found all the company awaiting
her, the front door open, and the carriage
that was to take her away being packed
with her travelling bags and wraps.

She shook hands with all the guests,
and smiled a gentle response to their
congratulatory farewells ; she shook
hands with John and his fellow-servants;
she kissed her uncle and
thanked him for all his kindness to
her; she embraced Lucilla and Beatrice
with silent fervour, and then her stately
aunt, to whom she repeated her grateful
acknowledgements for the home and care
that had been given her."

A MERE CHANCE.

I am afraid I have not made much
return to you for your goodness to me,
dear Aunt Elizabeth," she said, with
pathetic earnestness, but with no agitation
of voice or manner.

To her intense surprise the majestic
woman suddenly burst into tears.

"Oh, my child !" she said, tenderly,
I hope I have been as good an aunt
to you as you have been a good niece
to me. I hope you will be very, very
happy, my darling. If you are not, I
shall never forgive myself."

Mr. Kingston, of course, was standing
by, and a frown fell like a cloud
over his face. Mrs. Reade was also
standing by, and she looked at him
steadily for a few seconds with clear,
bright eyes.

Come, Rachel," he said, and he only

looked at his wife ; " we shall lose our
train if we don't make haste."

Rachel withdrew herself from her
aunt's arms, and Mr. Kingston took
her bj the hand and led her away,
followed from the house to her carriage
by all her train. She was a good deal
shaken by the little incident that had
so unexpectedly occurred.

There was no mystery to her in
what Mrs. Hardy had said, but the
thing she had done was very strange
and very touching. It invested the
Toorak House and all its belongings
with a new charm that the orphan girl
had never felt before with all the kindness
that she had enjoyed there.

At no time in the fourteen or fifteen
months that she had lived in it had
it seemed so much her *home" as at

this moment, when her aunt cried Hke
a mother at parting from her  so desirable
a place to stay in now that she
had to go.

'swells' said Mr. Kingston, when the
carriage was fairly out of the Hardy
grounds, and he had waved a gracious
adieu with the tips of his fingers to
the woman at the lodge, who stood in
her Sunday best and white satin cap-ribbons,
smiling and curtseying, to see
them pass ; " well, that is a good thing
over, isn't it ? Of all the senseless institutions
of this world, a wedding a la
mode is about the most preposterous.
You look knocked up already, when
you ought to be fresh for your
travels."

He spoke with a little nervous irritation,
and Rachel did not answer

him. Her heart was beating very fast,
beating in her ears and in lier
throat, as well as in the place where
its active operations were usually carried
on.

All her powers were concentrated
upon a desperate effort to postpone that
breaking-down which she had dreaded,
and which she felt was inevitable, until
she could shut herself within four
walls again. But she could not postpone
it.

Her husband took her hand and
asked her what was the matter with
her  whether she felt ill, or whether
she was regretting after all that she
had married him ; whether she was
going . to make him happy, as she had
promised, or to curse his life with its
bitterest disappointment  speaking half

VOL. III. 40

in love, half in anger, with a sudden
outburst of protesting entreaty provoked
by her irresponsive silence. And
she began to cry  almost to scream 
in the most violent and alarming
manner.

' My dear love ! my sweet child !"
cried the bridegroom, aghast. " T did
not mean to vex you, Rachel. I did not
mean to blame you, my pet. Rachel,
Rachel, hush ! do hush ! Don't let that
confounded coachman go back and say
Rachel, do you hear ? "  giving
her a little shake  '' there are people
passing. For Heaven's sake don't make
a scene in the street, whatever you
do !"

Rachel was almost beside herself with
excitement, but she was awake to the
indecency of betraying her emotion to

the servants and the passers-by. Moreover,
something in her husband's voice
steadied her.

By a strong effort she checked the
headlong impulse to rave and scream
that for a few seconds was almost
overpowering, and held herself in with
shut teeth and tight-locked hands, wildly
sobbing under her breath, and by-and
bye, when the first rush of passion had
spent itself, she became quiet and tractable,
fortunately, before they reached the
railway-station.

Mr. Kingston was terribly shocked
and outraged by this behaviour. He
would have given anything to be able
to scold her  in a gentle and judicious
manner, of course  but he was afraid
to attempt such a thing, or even to
speak of the probable causes that

402

had led to such deplorable impropriety.


He rummaged for his spirit-flask, and
made her drink a few drops of brandy,
which nearly choked her ; he found
some eau-de-cologne and bathed her
face; he got her to put on a thicker
veil, which happened to be amongst
the luxuries that her aunt and cousins
had stuffed into her travelling-bag ;
and he kissed her and petted her, and
when she attempted to explain and
excuse herself, bade her " Hush ! till
another time," and would not listen to her.

His immediate anxiety was to restore
her personal appearance and her powers
of self-command. The more important
matters could wait. And he succeeded
in his efforts ; she did not break down
any more.

Their journey that day was not very
far. An hour or two in the train, and
then half a dozen miles in a comfortable
covered buggy, and they reached
the country house which had been
placed at their disposal  the best substitute
to be had for that charming
residence on the shores of the bay at
Sydney  where they were to spend two
or three weeks in their own society
before starting by the next mail to
Europe.

As they were driving through the
silent bush, in the dusk of that
autumn day, and the bridegroom,
wrapped in his fur-collared overcoat,
was musing not very happily upon
the success that had crowned his lono-
cherished hopes and plans, his young
wife slipped her hand under his arm,

and laid her cheek upon his coat-sleeve.


'' Graham," she whispered softly.

He turned round quickly, and took
her in his arms. It was the first time
she had spoken his name and offered
him a caress voluntarily, and he was
greatly touched and cheered.

Will you forgive me P" she said,
not shrinking away from his embrace,
but creeping into it as she had never
done before. '' And, oh, will you love
me, in spite of it all?"

Love you !" he echoed, tenderly.
My sweet, I have always loved you
more than anybody in the world, and I
always shall. It will not be on my side
that love will be wanting."

She said no more, but she lay still,
with her head in its soft little sealskin

cap on Lis breast, as if lie liked to feel
his arms about her.

It was so new to him, and so immeasurably
delightful. He had never
expected to feel happier (even on his
wedding day) than he felt now, with
his best beloved, who had been so impracticable,
his own at last, giving herself
up to him in this way.

Poor, parasitic little heart, full of
spreading tendrils ! It was essential to
its very existence that it should have
something to cling to  which was a view
of the case, that happily did not chance
to strike him.

A DISCOVERY.

HERE was a great ball at
Toorak on the night of the
wedding, and like all the
nuptial ceremonies, it went off with
great eclat.

Mrs. Hardy recovered her serenity
very quickly after the bride's departure,
and appeared in the evening, clothed in
smiles and sapphire velvet, looking the
proud woman that it was generally conceded
she had a right to be. Lucilla,

at home for the first time since her
sister Laura's wedding, and since her
accession to the dignities of maternity,
and carrying herself very prettily as a
personage of consequence amongst the
unmarried friends of her girlhood, looked
extremely well and very happy, and
reflected great honour upon her family
in a variety of ways. Beatrice also
was unusually brilliant, not only in her
personal appearance, but in her mode of
discharging the duties of the occasion
a little too much so, indeed, if anything.


Some elderly ladies, and a very few
young men, were 'subsequently heard to
express an opinion that she carried that
sharp and satirical manner of hers to
an excess that was unbecoming in a
person of her sex and years, even if she

had married money and become a leader
of fashion.

A little after midnight, these two
young women, the one for the sake of
her baby, and the other on account of
her husband, excused themselves from
further attendance on Mrs. Hardy, and
drove back to South Yarra, where the
Thornleys were staying, carrying their
willing lords along with them.

When they reached home, where of
course they found bright fires ready
for them, the men retired to the smoking-room,
Mrs. Reade having laid upon her
brother-in-law the responsibility of keeping
his host from getting " any worse
than he was already ; " and the ladies
went upstairs to Lucilla's apartment.

Lucilla having only arrived in town
the day before, she and her sister had

had no opportunity for what they called
a good talk; and now the baby being
found asleep and in his nurse's charge
for the night, they sat down to begin
it, having previously got rid of ballroom
finery and made themselves comfortable
in their dressing-gowns.

"Does Ned often get a like this?"
Mrs. Thornley began, with a compassionate
inflection in her soft voice. She
knew of course that one couldn't expect
everything, but still she was sorry that
her sister's excellent marriage should
have this particular drawback, than
which she could hardly imagine one
more unpleasant and embarrassing, and
that a nice fellow Hke Ned, with a
noble pedigree and the sweetest temper in
the world, should take his social pleasures
as a shearer would celebrate pay-day.

Mrs. Reade was thinking, at the same
moment, that John was ageing very fast
and getting immensely stout, and that
his manner of addressing his wife, and
his bearing towards her generally,
was more peremptory and dictatorial
than she would feel inclined to put
up with if she were in Lucilla's
place.

''Oh, no," said the little woman,
sharply; "it is only on these festive
occasions, when I am not able to look
after him properly. And at the worst
he is not very bad. He never gets
obstinate and quarrelsome, as some men
do only vaguely argumentative and subsequently
sleepy. I should think no
husband, with so pronounced a tendency
that way could be easier to manage 
if one knows how to manage."

You were always a splendid manager,
Beatrice."

"Well, I just hold him well in hand
that's all. I know he can't help it,
to a certain extent, so I don't keep
always worrying at him about it. It
is only now and then that I give him
a real good talking to  to prevent his
thinking I might grow indifferent, as
much as anything."

He is such a dear, good fellow,"
said Lucilla, " but for that."

'' He is a dear, good fellow, in spite
of that," replied Beatrice, who allowed
no one but herself to disparage her
husband. " He is better worth having,
with all his faults  and that is about
the only one he has  than most of your
brilliant society men. I only hope Mr.
Kingston will be as little trouble to

Rachel as Ned lias been to me  and
half as good and kind to her."

*' Yes, dear. I didn't mean to say
that he wasn't the best of husbands 
far from it. Indeed, we may both be
thankful for our good luck in that respect
 all of us, I should say. I should
think no four girls in one family are
more happily situated than we are."

'' I hope so," sighed Mrs. Reade. " I
hope we are all as happy as  as weare
well off otherwise."

'dear little Rachel!" said Mrs.
Thornley, musingly. 'I don't think
there is any doubt about her being
happy. It is quite extraordinary to see
how fond of her Mr. Kingston is  really
fond of her, I mean. Did you think he
would ever marry such a young girl,
Beatrice ? and be so terribly anxious todo

it, too? I didn't. I suppose it washer
beauty captivated him."

Sto," said Beatrice; "it was the
fact that she didn't want to captivate
him. That has been her charm all along
he has felt that his honour was concerned
in making her, and it has been
a difficult task."

'' Oh, but I know he thinks a great
deal about beauty, and she is really the
prettiest girl in Melbourne, 1 do think,
though she does belong to us. She did
not look so pretty to-day though, as
I expected she would. That dead-white
in the morning that brides have to wear
does spoil even the best complexion. I
thought hers could stand anything, but
it can't stand that. When she wears
it in the evening, now  not dead-white,
but transparent white  she is a perfect

picture. At that ball of ours last
year everybody was talking of her.
She was in Indian muslin. John
said she was like a wood anemone."


Mrs. Reade was gazing thoughtfully
into the fire. The mention of the
ball at Adelonga stirred many troubled
thoughts. The real importance of
that event, in its effect upon Rachel,
had never been known to Mrs.
Thornley, who was led to suppose
that the suspension of Mr. Kingston's
engagement in October was solely
due to certain vanities on his part,
which the girl would not condone.

Mrs. Hardy's terror lest " people"
should get to know that a member
of her family had had any dealings
of a compromising nature with

such a person as she considered
Mr. Dalrymple to be had been
the cause of this extreme reticence.


A general impression prevailed amongst
the guests who had attended the
ball, that the handsome ex-hussar
had admired the belle of the evening
to an extent that had roused
the wrath of her fiance against him ;
but no one, strange to say, had
been able to discover more than
that.

Mr. Dalrymple himself never had
confidantes in these matters; and
Mr. Kingston, when he was enlightened
at Christmas, was as little
desirous as Mrs. Hardy that the
facts of the case should be published.
Beatrice and Rachel, who alone dis-vol.

III. 41

cussed them freely, did so with the
strictest secresy.

Mrs. Reade had no confidential
intercourse with her mother, as of
yore, on the subject of her cousin's
welfare. They had jointly resolved,
just before the younger lady set out
for her summer visit to Adelonga,
that it would be safer to exclude
Lucilla (as a married woman who
told her husband everything) from
any participation in the knowledge of
the mischief that Mr. Dalrymple had
done, and of Rachel's unfortunate infatuation
for him  which did not
seem so very serious at that time ;
aud since then his name had scarcely
been mentioned between them.

Now, however, the anxious little
woman, with a load of care that she

was by no means used to weighing
on lier heart, was impelled to take
advantage of the opportunity offered
by Lucilla's reference to that momentous
ball to put a question that
had suddenly become to herself,
tormenting importunate.

Has anything been heard of that
Mr. Dalrymple lately ?"

Oh, yes," said Lucilla ; " he is
gradually getting better."

*' Getting better !" echoed Beatrice,
sharply. " Why, what is the matter with
him? Is he ill?"

'' Didn't you hear ? He had a
dreadful accident. He was breaking
a young horse that was very wild,
and it bucked him off, or did something,
and he fell on his head. It is
a wonder he didn't break his neck.

412

No one saw it happen, for he was
away on the plains by himself, and
it was only when he did not come
home at night that Mr. Gordon went
to look for him. They were a longtime
finding him, and he had been
there for hours, and he was quite
insensible. There were some wild dogs
sniffing at him, as if he were really
dead. Indeed, Mr. Gordon said, if
they hadn't found him when they
did, the dingles would probably have
made an end of him. Was it not
dreadful?"

Mrs. Reade was staring at the fire,
not displaying that interest in the
narrative that its tragic details demanded,
apparently.

When did it happen ?" she asked
quietly, without lifting her eyes.

Oh, some time ago  in December.
We did not hear of it until January.
But he is only now able to get out
of bed and crawl about, poor fellow.
He was dreadfully hurt. His brain
was affected, and the summer weather
in that hot place was so much
against him. And, of course, he
couldn't have what he wanted up
there, and was too bad to be moved.
Mrs. Digby went there to nurse him
the Hales took the children for her.
It was enough to kill her, so delicate
as she is ; but she would go. She
idolises him almost. Mr. Digby went
with her, and stayed till the worst
was over. And Mr. Gordon was most
devoted  he went all the way to
Melbourne to consult the doctors
there about him, travelling night and day."

Were there no doctors nearer than
Melbourne?"

Yes, of course ; they had two.
But he wanted the best opinions.
He is Mr. Dalrymple's partner, you
know, and they were old friends
before they came out here."

'sand did Mr. Dalrymple seem to
be any better after he got the Melbourne
prescriptions ?"

*' No ; it was not a case where
doctors could do much. He seemed
to rally a little while Mr. Gordon
was away, but he had a bad relapse
afterwards. The weather became frightfully
hot, and the fever of course
got worse. He was delirious for a
whole fortnight, and then he was so
low that he just seemed sinking. However,
he must be an amazingly strongman

naturally. He managed to struggle
through it, and now be is getting
about, and all danger is over, though
Mrs. Digby says he is like a walking
skeleton. I expect she will have
brought him home with her by the
time we go back ; he will soon get
well when she has him in her own
house. I shall go over and see him,"
added Lucilla, compassionately ; " and
I shall ask him to come to Adelonga,
as soon as he is strong enough,
and let me nurse him for a few
weeks."

Mrs. Reade had before her mind's
eye that photograph which her sister
had shown her in Mrs. Digby' s
house. She saw every lineament of
the powerful, impressive face distinctly
even in a photograph it was nota

face that once looked at, could
be forgotten ; and she pictured to
herself the changes that months
of wasting illness would have made
in it.

A warm rush of indignant pity,
mingled with something near akin to
admiration, filled her heart, which was
wont to indulge itself in womanly
weaknesses  an impulse to champion
and befriend this man of so kingly
a presence, whose sins, whatever they
were, were balanced with so many
misfortunes. And yet for a moment
she could not help regretting that his
fall from his horse had not broken
his neck.

Ned, guiltily creeping into his 
about half an hour later,
never had the fumes of superfluous



champagne dispersed from this biain
so quickly. He saw this wife sitting
by her own fireside, with her feet on
the fender and her face in her hands,
crying  actually crying  like any
common woman .

TO MEET MR. AND MRS. KINGSTON.

ACHEL was away for nearly a
year and a half, seeing all the
kingdoms of the earth and the
glory of them in the most luxurious
modern fashion. It was such a tour
as a romantic and imaginative woman
born to a humdrum life would feel to
be the one thing to '' do " and die ; and
according to her account, she enjoyed
it extremely. She came home very

much improved by it in the opinion of
her aunt and other good judges.

'' Certainly," they said, '' travel is the
very best education ; there is nothing:
like it for enlarging* the mind, and
for giving polish and repose to the
manners."

Mrs. Kingston, indeed, when she took
her place in the society of vrhich her
husband had honos been so distinguished an
ornament, was a very interesting study,
as exemplifying this soundest of popular
theories. She was o-reatlv altered in all
sorts of ways. She had quite lost
that bashful rusticity which had been
Mrs. Hardy's despair', and in her unpretentious
fashion, was really very
dignified.

o

There was no hurry and flutter about
her now as there used to be; none of

that indiscriminate enthusiasm, which in
her aunt's eyes branded her as a poor
relation who " had never been used to
anything nice." She expressed her appreciation
of things smilingly and
sweetly, with more or less of her natural
bright frankness, but with a well-bred
moderation and serenity that might
have become a duchess. To please her
husband she wore rich raiment, " composed"
by the most distinguished
Parisian artists, and it symbolised the
change that all her individuality seemed
to have undergone.

She was no longer a girl, an ingenue
a bread-and-butter miss, a pretty little
nobody ; she was an experienced and
cultured woman, a leader of society,
fully equipped for that high position,
with a just appreciation of her own

importance, and relatively to that of
other people's.

Indeed, there seemed to certain persons
Miss Brownlow amongst others  indications
in her reticent and reposeful
manner of a tendency to be exclusive,
and to think a great deal too much of
herself.

Mrs. Hardy, who was immensely interested
in the unforeseen development,
was beyond measure gratified by it 
more especially as the young wife was
evidently on the best of terms with
her husband, though she had the good
taste to refrain from drawing public
attention to the fact.

Many apprehensions were set at rest
by the sight of her entering a room
on his arm, carefully and beautifully
dressed, as if she had enjoyed dressing

herself, and twinkling with diamonds
everywhere, responding to respectful
greetings with quiet grace, moving in
her comparatively higher sphere as if
she felt thoroughly at home in it. It
seemed to the anxious matron that an
end had been reached which justified
all the means that had been taken to
compass it.

Mrs. Reade was not so satisfied. She
looked at the change in Rachel from
another point of view. She did not
like to see a girl who had been
exceptionally girlish, turned into a
sober woman with such unnatural
rapidity.

Her sister Laura had come home, and
was now settled at Kew, giving entertainments
in a severely-appointed high-art
house; she had had quite as much

of the education of travel as Rachel 
perhaps more, inasmuch as her young
husband was a dabbler in bric-a-bric,
and had a taste for old churches, and
palaces, and pictures ; whereas Mr.
Kingston's interest in foreign cities,
however famous, had chiefly concerned
itself with the quality of the society
and the cuisine of the hotels.

But Laura, though stored with information
and experience., and lately
the happy mother of twin daughters,
was much the same as she had been
in her maiden days  cheerful, enterprising,
a rider of harmless hobbies, a
great believer in herself, and in the
force and variety of her fascinations.


She had improved and developed, of
course, but the experiences of travel

had not changed her as Rachel was
changed.

The acute Httle woman who practically
had never solved the meaning of
love and marriage, and quite understood
her disqualifications in this respect,
yet had glimmerings of the state of
things that existed in Rachel's heart.
She knew  though she had come to
the knowledge by slow degrees  that
the girl was not weak all through, but
only weak as the water-lily is,

Whose root is fix'd in stable earth, whose head
Floats on the tossing waves."

And that just as she had been tenacious
of certain principles in her earlier life,
when living with her father in an
atmosphere which she had only her
own instinct to teach her was tainted

with dishonour, so she would hold fast
to some other things, if they had taken
root, with a secret, blind integrity in
spite of her emotional fluctuations in the
winds and waves of circumstance.

She had adapted herself to the conditions
of her marriage with the pliant
submissiveness of her disposition ; but
there was a part of her that refused
to be reconciled to all the degradation
that was involved, and it was a tough
and vital part of her.

Since this was violently repressed,
comprehending as it did all those
aspiring ideals which had had so much
poetry and promise, and which represented
for her, in their loss as in
their possession, the meaning of human
happiness and the diviner aspect of
human life, there was naturally a great

VOL. III. 42

vacuum somewhere  a great emptiness
for which no compensating interests were
available. Hence that serene impressiveness
of mien and manner which
had so mature and distinguished an
air.

Mrs. Reade's own marriage was very
much of the same pattern in one
respect  it was but an outward and
visible sign of marriage that had no
inward and spiritual grace ; but then
she did not know what it was that she
missed, and Rachel did. And the difference
between the two cases was
perfectly obvious to that intelligent
woman.

On the return of Mr. and Mrs.
Kingston to Melbourne, a number of
fashionable parties were of course given
in their honour. At the chief of these,

a great ball in the Town hall, the
dramatic action of this story, temporarily
suspended by our heroine's
absence from the country which held
all its elements in solution, so to speak,
was suddenly set going again.

It was towards the end of October,
just when the gay season of the races
was about to set in, and when the
spring was in its glory. It strangely
happened to be also the anniversary of
the night of her clandestine betrothal
to Rodenn Dalrymple, which was the
memorable last time  two whole years
ago  that she had seen or heard of
him.

Nowadays she never mentioned Rodenn
Dalrymple's name. She had never
mentioned it to her husband since he
and she came to a certain under -

42  2

standing on their wedding-da j, and her
husband had scrupulously avoided mentioning
it to her ; which reticence on
his part was odd and uncomfortable
rather than considerate and delicate, inasmuch
as she was intensely anxious to
pursue the line of conduct that she had
laid down for herself in her relations
with him  to have no secrets and to
tell the truth  and to bring their companionship
into such harmony and
sympathy as the nature of things made
possible.

And since her return she had never
even suggested the existence of her
lost lover to any of those who might
have given her information about him
not even to Beatrice. She ' would
not recognise that she felt " any interest
in his existence.

Nevertheless, she Kved in a perpetual,
absorbing, all-pervading consciousness
that he and she were " in the world
together," and that the key. to the
whole system of the universe lay somehow
in that fact.

And the years and months, and days
and hours were all dates in the first
place, and periods of time in the
second ; and every date was a
register of ineffaceable memories of
him, which she could not destroy or
ignore.

So on this great anniversary, as the
hour approached which witnessed their
last interview in the solitude of the
half-built house (the boudoir was in
the hands of the decorators now, and
the sacred spot of floor was covered
over with inlaid woodwork), she tried

to put the thought of it out of her
mind  tried to shut her eyes to the
inevitable agonising and tantalising
perception of what might have been 
and yet was acutely responsive to
every tick of the clock on her mantelpiece,
checking off the reminiscent
moments one by one. She followed
the events of that long-ago happy
night perforce as an unquiet spirit
'' raised " against its will.

Now we were sitting together,"
she remembered, as the little clock
struck nine silvery notes. '' We were
looking at the moonlight on the bay.
Ah, me, how lovely that moonlight
was !"

Rachel," called her husband from
his dressing-room within, whither he
had just arrived from a dinner at the

club, " aren't you dressed yet ? I rue
that young woman of yours on the
stairs ; she seems to have more time
on her hands than she knows
what to do with. Why don't you
make her wait on you better? She
ought to be getting you ready by this
time."

Rachel jumped up hastily and
rang for her maid, whose ministrations,
essential to the dignity of her
present position, she certainly did not
appreciate.

I shall not be long dressing,"
she replied ; 'rand it is early
yet."

And then she went into his room
to ask him if he had had a pleasant
party at dinner, and whether he had
enjoyed it, anxious to show him some

special tenderness on this special night
anxious to find some shelter in his
affection from the reminiscences that
beset her.

He was a little irritable, for his gout
was troubling him, and he did not
respond to her advances. He patted
the hand that she laid on his arm ina
perfunctory manner, and sent her
back to begin her preparations for
the ball. He did not wish her to
dress herself quickly ; he wanted her
to make the most of her beauty and
her supplementary resources on such a
great occasion.

He was very fond of his wife still,
and proud of her, and good to her
in his own rather tyrannical way; but
his marriage with her, after a year
and a half of it, had become to himself

as under the circumstances was
inevitable  a very un romantic and
commonplace affair.

They had lived together in tolerable
peace and comfort ; they had never
quarrelled, simply because it was
Rachel's habit to efface herself at
the first symptoms of rising temper ;
but neither had they been companions,
in any proper sense of the
term.

As yet he had no active sense of
injury and injustice, in that the possession
of his treasure gave him such
meagre compensation for all that he
had paid for it, but he did feel, in a
general way, that matrimony was  ashe
confessed he had been well warned
that it would be very tame and dull,
and uninteresting, and that it would

be too unreasonable altogether to
expect a man to devote himself
exclusively to its demands. Even
little Rachel herself, he was quite sure,
would not wish him to be bored to
death.

And so he fell back insensibly into
many of his old self-indulgent habits,
and the pleasures of his bachelor life
grew more than ever pleasant. This
was particularly the case after his
return to Melbourne, where his face
became as familiar to club men as in
the ante-nuptial days. Some excuse
for this independence was supposed
to lie in the fact that he and his
wife had not yet settled down to
housekeeping.

The Toorak mansion was being furnished
and decorated with the treasures

of art and upholstery that they had
brought out with them ; and until
everything was completed, and the
entire establishment was in proper order
for their reception, and for the giving
of that magnificent house-warming to
which the world of Melbourne fashion
as looking forward, they were inhabiting
a suite of rooms in an hotel,
and domestic life, consequently, was to
a certain extent disorganised.

On this night of which we are speaking,
Rachel thought it was very kind and
attentive of him to come home to her a
full hour before he needed to have done.
It never occurred to her, any more than
to him, that he neglected her.

The servants of the hotel, who were on
the watch for a sight of her as she went
to her carriage, thought her not only one

of the most lovely, but one of the most
fortunate of women ; and so did the
majority of the gay company at the Town
Hall, when she made her appearance
amongst them.

She had come back from Europe and all
her sea-voyaging, in excellent physical
health, and the last year or two of her
life, in spite of sorrowful vicissitudes, had
ripened and developed her beauty in a
very marked degree.

She was dressed in white, but with
great richness, of course  her husband
had seen to that ; covered with precious
lace, that was as attractive to the eyes of
the Melbourne ladies as the delicacy of her
pure complexion was to those of the men.
And she wore her necklace of diamond
stars, and diamonds on her arms, and on
her bosom, and in her hair ; and she was

altogether very magnificent, and made a
great sensation.

Amongst her many admirers she noticed,
when she had been in the room a little
while, a short, stout man, of about forty
or fifty years of age, apparently, who was
a stranger to her, regarding her with
much attention.

He had rather an air of distinction
about him in spite of bis low stature, and
a noticeable absence of beauty; and she
had a dim  very dim  impression that she
had seen him, or someone like him,
before.

He wore a fair moustache but no beard
or whiskers, and his florid face was
marked down one side with the puckered
white scar of an old wound.

His eyes were quick and bright, and
the keen observation that he brought to

bear upon lier through an eyeglass that he
put into one of them whenever she came
near, obviously with the intention of
studying her to the best advantage, was a
little disconcerting even to an acknowledged
beauty.

She was waltzing with Mr. Buxton  it
was her second waltz, and he danced very
well  when suddenly, high in the air over
her head, the great clock chimed eleven,
and all the associations of that sacred hour
gathered like ghosts around he rode
Dairy male holding the lighted match to
his watch, while she sheltered the little
flame from the wind  her head touching
his cheek and his huge moustache as they
looked down together to see the time 
the mystic light and stillness of the peaceful
night, through which the sound of the city
bells came up to them, to warn them that

their happiness was a thing too good to
last.

"Eleven p.m," he had called it; and
"you must go home, little one," he had
said. Could it have been at that moment
that he meant to send her away so far,
and never to take her back to his
arms and his heart again ?

Aw  what's the matter ? Are you
dizzy ?" asked her partner, feeling a
break and a jar in the rhythm of the
measure that had been flowing so very
harmoniously.

"A little," she whispered. "1 should
like to sit down for a few minutes 
we'll go on again, if you like, presently."


He led her to a retired bench, and
while she rested stood beside her,
silently watching the people who continued

to revolve before them. She had
hardly sat down, and was beginning
mechanically to fan herself, when the
stranger with the eyeglass came up,
with a lady, who was also unknown to
her, on his arm.

Here's a seat," said the little stout
man ; and his partner, an elderly and
amiable matron, sat down, bestowing
the deprecatory smile of old-fashioned
courtesy upon the two already in possession.


He took the end of the bench
himself, and chatted away to her  she
was his aunt, apparently  leaning a little
forward, with an elbow on his knee;
and Rachel, dreamily occupied as she
was, was quite conscious that his keen
eyes dwelt persistently, not upon his
neighbour's face, but upon her own.

"Why don't you go and get a partner,
James?" said the elderly matron. " You
don't want to dance attendance upon
me, my dear  I shall do very well here
until Lucy wants me. Go and find
some pretty young lady, and enjoy yourself
like the rest of them."

'' I don't believe in pretty young
ladies," replied the little man, rather
bluntly. " Except Lucy  and she is
engaged for the whole night, as far as
I can make out."

Here ensued some comments upon
Lucy, who appeared to be the lady's
daughter, generally favourable to that
young person. And the little man then
began to inveigh against the abstract
girl of the period with trenchant
vigour obviously to the great embarrassment
of his companion, who tried her

VOL. III. 43

best, but vainly, to divert him to other
topics.

"In fact, there are no girls nowadays,"
he remarked coolly; *They are
all calculating, selfish, heartless, worldly
women  always excepting Lucy, of
course  as soon as they cease to be
children. They have only one object in
life, and that is to marry a man  no,
not a man necessarily, a forked stick
will do who has plenty of money."

'' My dear, that is a popular sentiment,
I know, and supposed to be full
of wet and wisdom, but it always seems
to me that it is just a little vulgar,"
replied his companion, frowning surreptitiously,
and giving uneasy sidelong
glances at Rachel. " There are girls
and girls, of course, just as there are
men and men ; we see bad and good

in every class. How beautifully this
place lights up, to be sure !"

They like a fellow to dance with
them and dangle after them, and make
love to them, and break his heart for
them nothing pleases them better 
when they have no serious business on
hand," the little man proceeded, with
unabashed composure, and still gazing
steadily at Rachel ; '' but when it comes
to marriage  "

"My dear James, I am not recommending
marriage to you  only a
harmless waltz."

*' Then they are for sale to the
highest bidder, whoever he may happen
to be. The poor, impecunious lover 
be he ever so much a lover, and
the best fellow that walks the earth
into the bargain  must take himself o-ff

432

and cut his throat for all she
cares."

At this sudden change from the plural
to the singular, and at something personal
and impertinent that she recognised in the
tone and look of the speaker, a deep blush
flooded Rachel's face, and she rose from
her seat with dignity, but trembling in
all her limbs.

Aw  who the dickens is that fellow?"
Mr. Buxton whispered, with a scowl supposing,
however, that he could only be a
disappointed aspirant for Rachel's hand.
'' He's an impudent brute, whoever he is,
and I have a good mind to tell him so.
What's his name, eh?"

I don't know," said Rachel. But as
she spoke, and was about to move away,
the stranger rose and stood with an air of
courteous deference to let her pass him 

an air that somehow indicated the breeding

and manners of a gentleman; and all at

once it flashed across her where and when

she had seen him before. He was the man

who had called at Toorak and been closeted

with her aunt at the time when Rodenn

Dalrymple had promised to come for her,

nearly two years ago. She had gone out

into the garden, thinking he might possibly

have been Rodenn, to intercept him as he

was going away. She had had only a

distant glimpse of himof his short,

square figure, and the lower part of his

face  but she recognised now that this

was the same man. She had not gone

many steps into the room, feeling strangely

overwhelmed by her discovery, when a

pair of exhausted waltzers went trailing

by, and one of them said to the other,

'' Didn't somebody say Jim Gordon was

here to-night ? Where is the old fellow
hiding himself ? I should like to see him
again."

The little man with the eyeglass was 
of course he was Rodenn Dalrymple's
friend and partner.

She drew her hand from her cousin's
arm, turned round, and walked deliberately
back to the seat she had just
quitted.

No," she said to her pursuing cavalier,
'* do not come. Go and dance with somebody,
and fetch me presently."

'' My dear Rachel, you must allow me 
aw, I couldn't really  "

I want to speak to Mr. Gordon," she
said, pausing in front of that gentleman.
Mr. Gordon, I want to ask you something.
Will you kindly take me out to
the lobbies  somewhere where it is quiet 

if this lady will excuse you for a few
minutes?"

Mr. Buxton was utterly bewildered, as
well lie might be. He stared, stiffened
himself, and then went off to find Laura,
and to tell her of the extraordinary proceedings
of her cousin "with some insolent
beofoar whose name she said she didn't know,
though she addressed him by it almost in
the same breath," and to intimate (merely
by way of soothing his own injured dignity)
that there seemed to him something
"rather fishy" going on.

And Mr. Grordon, after losing his presence
of mind for about half a minute, and then
only partially recovering it, silently offered
his arm to the lady who had made that
strange appeal to him. He had never seen
her until to-night; he had hoped he never
should see her, or have anything to do with

her. She had been, in his imagination of
her, the embodiment of all that was detestable
in woman. But now something in
the candid young face, unnaturally set and
pale, and in the suppressed passion and
purpose of her manner, gave him compunctious
misgivings, and a vague but
alarming impression that there had been
some blundering somewhere.

You are Mr. Gordon, are you not ?"
she began hurriedly, as soon as they
were out of the crowd and glare of the
ball-room. 'eyes, I thought so: but I
did not recognise you at first. I should
have waited for an introduction, but I
was afraid you might go away. I think
you know who I am. What you were
saying just now had it not some reference
to me ?"

The little man began to stammer incoherently.

He was completely overbalanced
'hj the shock of this unexpected
attack. Rachel, on the contrary, usually
so fluttered by an emergency, had a
sort of fierce, collected calm about her.

''I am sure it had," she said. '' And
I want to know what you meant ?"

I  a  perhaps you are aware that
I am Mr. Dalrymple's friend, Mrs.
Kingston. I am therefore, perhaps,
something of a partisan  forgive me,
if I forgot myself for the moment  "

'' Ah," she broke out sharply, " there
has been some great mistake ! Tell
me  quickly  before anyone is here to
interrupt us  did you come to see my
aunt that Christmas  the Christmas
before last ?"

Certainly I came to see her and you,"
he replied.

'' Did he send sou ?"

'' Of course he did."

Why ?"

"Why!" he echoed angrily. ''Do
you mean to say you don't know
why ?"

''I know nothingness said Rachel. She
stood before him shining in her satin
and diamonds, without a trace of colour
in her face ; and the anguish of her beseeching
eyes told him plainly that she
spoke the truth.

Oh, dear me, this is terrible !" he exclaimed,
in a flurry of dismay and consternation.
" Do you mean to say that
you didn't know that he was ill ?  that
you didn't tell Mrs. Hardy to write that
letter ? that it was all done without your
knowing anything about it? Good
Heavens ! would anybody believe there

were such malignant fiends in existence
and such fools!" he added bitterly.

Then he told her the whole story 
how her lover had got hurt, and had lain
insensible for many days, between life
and death  how his first anxiety upon
recovering consciousness was about his
appointment with her  how he had deputed
his friend to go to Melbourne and
explain his inability to keep it ; and
how he (Mr. Grordon) had seen Mrs.
Hardy and afterwards Mr. Kingston, and
been led by them to an apparently unavoidable
conclusion.

She said you were not willing to seeme,
but that she would give you my
messages and explanations," said the
little man, thinking it would be best for
his friend (and not much caring what it
would be for other people) to have it all

out at once, while he was about it ;
'' and that she would send me a note to the
club, where I was staying, in the evening,
or instruct you to do so. She had
already told me that you were re-engaged
to  a  your present husband. At night
I got the letter, in which she repeated
this assertion, stating that you had empowered
her to do so."

*' And you went and told him that ?"

'' I did not go and tell him that  for
I did not want to kill him  until I had
taken every possible precaution to get
it corroborated."

Yes ?" ejaculated Rachel, breathlessly.


I obtained an introduction to Mr.
Kingston at the club, and I asked him
on his honour to tell me if what Mrs.
Hardy had said was true."

You told him why you wanted to
know ?"

I did."

She stood still for a few seconds to
collect her strength ; whole years of effort
and agony were concentrated in that
little interval.

Shall you be going back to Queensland
soon ?" she asked quietly.

I am going back tomorrow," he
said  though he had not previously
thought of doing so.

'* Tell him when you see him 
tell him from me  that I never
knew anything  never, never, from
the day I saw him last until tonight."


It will break his heart to hear it,
Mrs. Kingston."

"No he will be glad to know that

I was not utterly base. And I  I want
him to know it."

'' And shall I  can I  tell him that
you were really not engaged when they
said you were  when he thought you
were waiting for him ?"

She flushed deeply and drew herself
up with a little stately gesture.

He will not wish you to go into
those particulars, Mr. Gordon. If
you will give him my message simply,
that is all I want you to do. He will
understand it. Will you take me back
to the ball-room now ? I should like to
find my cousin, Mrs. Reade."

A Crisis.

S nature makes us, so to a great
extent, the roost of us remain,
when education has done its
very best, or its very worst, to modify
the great mother's handiwork. Her
patterns, of which no one ever saw the
original designs, and that have been
unknown centuries a-weaving, cannot be
sensibly altered in the infinitesimal fragment
that one human lifetime represents,
though every thread of circumstance, in

its right or wrong adjustment, must
have its value in the ultimate product,
whatever that unimaginable thing maybe.


Still, in the individual man or woman,
here and there, the type that he or she
belongs to is temporarily obscured by
accidental causes ; the lines of character,
laid down by many forefathers, are
twisted or straightened by violent
wrenching of irresponsible fate  as in
less important branches of nature's business
her processes are interrupted by
lightning and earthquakes, and other
rebellious forces.

Rachel, from the hour when she discovered
how it was that she and Eoden
Dairy male had been defrauded of their
'rights," was apparently quite changed
(though  as she is still a very young

woman  we are not prepared to suppose
that she will never be her old weak and
timid and clinging self again). She was
turned, from a soft and shrinking girl,
into a hard and fearless, if not a
defiant, woman.

The immense strength of her love 
always an incalculable " unknown quantity
" in the elements of human character
and the factors of human destiny  had
already given force and point, and meaning
and dignity, to her whole personality
and her relations with life ; but now the
magnitude of her wrongs and misfortunes,
and still more of his, seemed to
dwarf and crush every feeble trait and
sentiment in her.

She went back to the ball-room,
very white and silent, on Mr. Gordon's
arm; and the first person of her own

VOL. TII. 44

party whom she met there was Mr.
Reade, under whose protection she
placed herself, dismissing her late escort
with a quiet "good-night."

She asked to be taken to Beatrice ; and
Ned, who never knew from whom he had
received her, piloted her through the
crowd until he found his small wife,
whose bright eyes no sooner rested on
Rachel's face than they recognised a
new calamity.

"Has she heard anything, I
wonder ?" she asked herself in
dismay. "Are you ill?" she inquired
aloud.

I want to go home," said
Rachel.

The little woman did not waste
time asking useless questions. She
took her cousin to the cloak-room.

sent Ned for a cab, and in a few
minutes the three were driving to the
Kingston' hotel.

When they reached Rashers ,
and Ned had been sent
downstairs to see if her maid was
on the premises, Mrs. Reade put her
arms round her tenderly, and begged
to know what was the matter with
her.

But Rachel, singularly unresponsive
to the rare caress, would not tell 
would not talk at all. She would
not betray the mother's crime to the
daughter, and she would not mention
the name of her beloved, even to
her dearest friend, in these married
days.

"I am not well," she said, gently
but with an odd harshness in her

442

face and voice. '' I could not dance
I could not stay in that place. I
shall be better here. Go back, Beatrice,
and make excuses for me. Say I was
not well."

I shall do no such thing," said
Beatrice bluntly. " I shall not leave
you until Graham comes home."

Each el begged and protested with
a sharp peremptoriness that was very
unusual to her. Beatrice, full of
anxiety and consternation, was obdurate.


In the midst of their discussion,
they heard Mr. Kingston coming upstairs,
bustling along in great haste.
He flung open the door, with an air
of angry irritation.

"Oh, here you are !" he exclaimed
loudly. " What on earth are you

doing? Everybody is inquiring for
you, Eacliel. Aren't you well? Why
didn't you tell me, and let me
bring you home, if you wanted to
come ? You have set all the room
talking and gossiping, slinking off
before midnight in this way  as if
you were a mere nobody, who
would not be missed  and not letting
me know. What's the matter,
eh ?"

Rachel, without changing her position
by a hair's breadth, lifted her eyes
steadily and looked at him, but she
did not speak.

Mrs. Reade saw the look, and
she needed no words to tell her
that some crisis in the conjugal
relations of this pair had come,
which no outsider had any business

to see or meddle with ; and she
guessed correctly what it was.

"I will go back, and make what
explanations are necessary," said she ;
and I will come round in the morning,
Rachel."

And she went out quickly, and closed
the door behind her. On the stairs she
met Rachel's maid going up, and told
her her mistress would ring when she
wanted her ; and in the lobby of the
hotel she replied to her husband's anxious
inquiries by declaring irrelevantly that
she wished Mr. Kingston, and his house
and his money, were all at the bottom of
the sea.

That gentleman, meanwhile, after following
her out upon the landing, and
looking over the stairs to see that her
natural protector was in attendance,

returned to his wife with a vague presentiment
of unpleasantness in some
shape or other.

He, too, had been struck with the
peculiar expression of Rachel's face, and
a guilty conscience intimated at once
that she had " found out something,"
though it did not suggest any catastrophe
in particular. There were so
many things that, by unlucky accident,
she might find out.

However, I am not going to be
called to account by her," he said to himself,
in that spirit of swagger which she
had herself nursed and nourished by
her excess of wifely meekness. " I
am not Ned Reade, to submit to
be dictated to and sat upon by
my own wife  so she needn't begin
it."

And he walked into the drawing-room
in a lordly manner.

The reception that he met with
staggered him considerably.

Graham* said Rachel, in a very
quiet voice, " did you send word to Mr.
Rodenn Dalrymple that I was engaged to
you that Christmas  you know when I
mean  two years ago, when I was ill?
Did you tell that he to Mr. Gordon
deliberately, when you knew how things
were with us ?"

He was silent  intensely silent  for a
few minutes, amazed, ashamed, embarrassed,
and savage. He did not know
how to answer her. Then he gave a little
short surly laugh.

What about it ? Who has been talking
to you of those things ? What is Mr. Dalrymple
to you now, I should like to know ?"

Did you ?" lie persisted.

"And what if I did?" he retorted
roughly, but still making a ghastly
attempt at badinage. " All's fair in love
and war, you know, my dear ; and it was
that aunt of yours who told the lie, as you
elegantly term it  if it was a lie  not I ;
I merely did not contradict her."

She looked at him steadily, with that
implacable hardness in her once soft
eyes.

''I will never forgive you," she
said ; "I will never, never forgive
you."

'' I am sure I am very sorry to
hear it; but I suppose I can manage
to get on without your forgiveness,"
he began. And then he gave up
trying to make a joke of it, and
turned upon her savagely. *' Have you

been seeing that fellow, Eacliel ? Tell
me this instant; I insist upon knowing."


"I have seen his friend," she said,
quietly.

"And did he send his friend to
make those explanations to you  to
you r*

No ; he did not send him. It was
by accident that I met Mr. Gordon tonight
?"

And what business had you to talk
to Mr. Gordon  to talk to anybody 
about your old love affairs ? Do you
forget that you are a married woman
that you are my wife ? It was bad
enough when you were single to be
mixing yourself up with a disreputable
scoundrel like that "

'' He is not a disreputable scoundrel,"

You mean to say you can sit there and
tell me that to my face ?"

'' I can only tell the truth," she replied,
with the same hard deliberation. '' I
could no more help loving him, especially
now I understand how things have been
with us  no one will know it, but it will
be in my heart  than I could help
breathing. When I leave off breathing,
then I shall forget him perhaps, not
before."

Mr. Kingston was beside himself with
passion  as, indeed, so was she.

Forewarned is forearmed," he said,
with a sort of sardonic snarl ; '' I shall
know now what steps to take to protect
my honour."

You know perfectly well that your
honour  what you call your honour  is
safe," she replied proudly. "If I am not
to be trusted, he is. Do not insult us anymore.
We have had enough cruelty ; we
shall have quite enough to bear  he
and I."

And so they went on with these bitter
and defiant recriminations  Mr. Kingston,
of course, insisting upon giving due prominence
to his own wrongs, which were
very real ones in their way, and both of
them making reckless proposals with
respect to their domestic arrangements 
until suddenly, without any apparent
warning, Rachel went off into wild
hysterics, and the doctor had to be sent
for.

Perhaps it was the best thing that could
have happened under all the circumstances.

She was very ill for several
hours ; and in the morning, when passion
was spent, and she was lying in her bed
still and quiet, with her head swathed in
wet bandages, her husband knelt down
beside her and asked her to forgive him.

It was for love of you that I did it,"
he said ; " and / am punished, too. We
can't undo it now, Rachel, if we would,
and there's no good in making a public
talk and scandal. Let bygones be bygones,
won't you, dear ?"

She lifted her heavy eyes to his face.
They were cold and hard no longer, but
unutterably dull and sad.

'' Yes," she said wearily ; " we have
both been wrong ; we have injured one
another. We must try to make the best
of it ; it is the only thing we can do

He kissed her and stroked her face, and
adjusted the wet bandages.

There, there," he said soothingly,
we both forgot ourselves a little. We
said a great deal more than we meant, I
daresay. People do when they are out of
temper."

And he bade her go to sleep, told her
he would take her for a drive in the
afternoon if she felt well enough, and
went forth with the sense that he was
treating her magnanimously to receive
and reply to inquiries after her health in
person.

Bv noon, '* all Melbourne," according
Mrs. Hardy's calculation, was aware
that Mr. and Mrs. Kingston had had a
quarrel (though there was every variety
of conjecture as to the cause of it. and a
division of opinion as to which was the

A MERE CHANCE.

most to blame) ; but it was not Mr.
Kingston's fault if all Melbourne was not
satisfied by nightfall that the quarrel had
been made up.

CHAPTER VI.

MRS READE MEETS HER MATCH.

ILL Mr. Rodenn Dalrymple do
Mrs. Edward Reade the great
favour to call upon lier tomorrow
(Thursday) morning, if convenient
to him, between ten and twelve
o'clock? She is particularly anxious to
see him upon a matter of private business."


This note was despatched from South
Yarra to Menzies on a certain night in the
early part of December few weeks after

VOL. III.



the Town Hall ball. Mr. Dalrymple had
just come to Melbourne, and Mrs. Eeade,
through the gossip of afternoon visitors,
had heard of it.

She had heard of a great deal more
besides  from Laura's husband chiefly;
and the critical nature of the situation,
and her anxious solicitude for Each el's
welfare in the midst of the perils and
temptations to which, while a meeting
with her old lover was possible, she would
be exposed, made it seem absolutely necessary
that the person who was most capable
of doing so effectually should interfere
once more.

The course she adopted in undertaking
this delicate and difficult enterprise was
worthy alike of her courage and her good
sense. She had never met Mr. Dalrymple,
and she had no definite knowledge of his

character, only an impression that he was
*' wild "  a man of the world, with a
touch of the libertine and the vagabond
about him  and that he was also undoubtedly
a gentleman, with some of the
finer qualities that are the heritage of
good blood.

Yet she determined that she would
abjure all schemes and artifices, and see
him herself before there was time for anything
to happen, and appeal to his honour
and generosity on behalf of the woman
he loved  upon whose peace it seemed
evident to her he had some selfish if not
distinctly evil designs.

'' He has come to town in consequence
of Mr. Grordon's representations, of
course, for no other purpose than to
see her," the little woman said to
herself the moment she heard of his

452

arrival ; '' and if lie does see her,
nothing but trouble can possibly come
of it."

So she determined to prevent trouble
if possible, and this seemed to her the
proper way.

She prepared herself for the interview
on the Thursday morning, without any
sense of having undertaken a difficult
task.

When he arrived she was discussing
dinner with her cook, and she walked
from the larder to the drawing-room
with a very grave and thoughtful face,
but feeling perfectly serene and self-possessed.


He was standing in the middle of
the room, facing the door, with his hat
in his hand when she entered. He
looked immensely tall, and stiff, and

stately. There was an air of impracticable
independence in his attitude,
and in the distant dignity of his salutation
that disconcerted her a little. He
was wonderfully like his photograph she
thought, and yet he was a much more
imposing personage than she had bargained
for.

'* Oh, Mr. Dalrymple  it was so kind
of you to come," she said, in her quick,
easy way. ''I must apologise for summoning
you in such a very informal
manner, but  a  won't you sit down ?"

She dropped into one of her soft, low
chairs ; and her visitor seated himself at
a little distance from her, not hesitatingly,
but with just so much deliberation as
indicated a protest against the prolongation
of the interview.

*' I understood from your note that you

wished to see me upon some business,"
lie suggested gravely.

'' I did," she replied, feeling unaccountably
flustered. "Perhaps you will think
it rather impertinent of me  perhaps it is
a liberty for me to take  but the fact is I
have so deep an interest in my cousin's
welfare  she is so very dear to me  I
must plead that as my excuse "

You are speaking of Mrs. Kingston ?"
he interposed in the same cool and distant
manner, ''I hope she is quite well? I
have not had the pleasure of seeing her
since her marriage."

She is quite well, thank you. I trust
she will keep so, but I am afraid she is
not very strong. Mr. Dalrymple, I ought
perhaps to tell you that I  that Rachel
told me  that I am aware of the relationship
that has existed between you."

We will not speak of that, if you
please, Mrs. Reade."

But I sent for you on purpose to-speak
of it."

Then I must ask you to excuse me,"
he said, rising haughtily. " I cannot
discuss those matters with strangers  
still less with a member of Miss Fathers
family."

But, Mr. Dalrymple, I am not to
blame for anything that has happened 
for any mistakes that have been made
I assure you I am not. I never
knew of your accident  I never knew
that Mr. Gordon came down  I
never knew anything more than
Rachel did, until it was too late.
And I was her intimate friend all
that time, and she made me her
confidante, I served her interests as far

as a friend who loved her could, to the
best of my power."

If that is so, I am very grateful to
you," he said gently, " though I am afraid
you failed to see what her interests were.
May I ask if you are acting under her
instructions now ? Did she authorise you
to make this appointment for the purpose
of speaking of these things ?"

Of course she did not."

Then we will not speak of them.
There would be very grave impropriety in
doing so. You must see, Mrs. Reade,
that nothing you can say will in the least
degree affect the case for anyone. 1
think we all know the truth of the story
now. It is too late to take any action
one way or the other. For Mrs. Kingston's
sake, the fewer reminiscences we
allow the better. Our business is to

reconcile ourselves to circumstances, since
they are irrevocable, and to let the past
alone. If it was your intention to explain
to me that you were guiltless of active
participation in the crime which parted
us, believe me, I appreciate the kind
motive, and I thank you from my heart.
But it is much better not to say any more
about it."

He was still standing with his hat in
his hand, and that peculiar distant lookin
his sad and haughty face. Mrs. Reade
sat before him in her low chair silent,
with her eyes cast down.

Not one of the numerous gentlemen in
whose affairs she had condescended to
take an interest had ever treated her like
this, and she felt inexpressibly humiliated.
Yet she had no sense of resentment,
strange to say, against the individual

who dominated her, and the position
generally, in such an unexampled
manner.

Did I understand you to say that Mrs.
Kingston was not strong?" he inquired
after a short pause.

T think she is very well," Mrs. Eeade
meekly responded. '' Her constitution is
quite sound; but her nervous system is
delicate. She cannot stand worry, or
shocks, or any great excitement or fatigue
any of those things upset her."

I should imagine so. But it is always
possible to keep her free of those things,
is it not ?"

Mrs. Reade replied, not so much to
the letter as to the spirit of the
question.

Her husband takes good care of her,"
she said. " He is very thoughtful for her

comfort. She does not run any risk of
harm that he can spare her. If we are
all as careful of her welfare as he is, Mr.
Dalrymple  if we are as scrupulous to
protect her peace now she is at peace "

She broke off, and lifted her eyes wistfully.


Mr. Dalrymple looked down upon her
with stately and impenetrable composure.


'* I am deeply thankful to know that
her marriage has so far been satisfactory,"
he said. " I suppose the house in Toorak
is nearly finished, is it not ?"

"It is quite finished. They went into
it three weeks ago."

It promised to be a very good house,
though rather of the nouveaux riches order
of architecture," he proceeded coolly; " and
unfortunately it is impossible to manufacture

trees, without which the best
house looks bald and naked. But it stands
well. It must be a very healthy situation ;
and that, after all, is the principal consideration."


I hope she will be happy in it," said
Mrs. Reade. Her soul rebelled against
this mode of treating the question, and
yet her efforts to divert the discussion
into the channels that she had
designed for it were absurdly feeble and
futile.

I hope so, indeed," he replied gravely.
'' I suppose you see a great deal of her,
do you not?"

Yes. I seldom miss a day without
seeing her. Either 1 go to Toorak, or
she comes here, or we meet somewhere
about town. I do whatever is in my
power to help to make her happy."

'' It must be a happiness to you, too,
to have her friendship and confidence in
such a marked degree."

It is," said Mrs. Reade.

I  if you will excuse me  I will say
good morning. Allow me to thank you
very much for permitting me to call,
and for your kind interest in my misfortunes
 and in Mrs. Kingston's welfare.
But the greatest service you can do
her, Mrs. Reade, is to be silent yourself,
and to discourage gossip in others,
about anything that occurred either
before or since her marriage in connection
with me. I hope I do not seem
discourteous in saying this  if so, pray
forgive me. I speak to you frankly,
because you are her friend. I am
afraid she has not had many friends 
there is the more reason that we who

desire her welfare and happiness, should
take every precaution against imperilling
it bj allowing any hint of these
private matters to reach the ears of
vulgar scandalmongers. A great crime
has been done, for which if there
is anything in the theory of retribution,
some one will have to answer
some day ; but in the meantime our
part is to take care that she is spared
as much difficulty and suffering as
possible."

"Yes, Mr. Dalrymple. That is what
I think that is what I was going to
say."

I am sure you think so. I am sure
you see that that is all we can do for
her now. Good morning. I am much
obliged to you for your kindness. It
looks rather as if we were going to

have a storm, does it not ? The air is
close and sultry, and the glass is falling
very fast."

He turned from looking out of the
window and made a stately bow ; she
laid her hand upon the bell mechanically
she had no arts wherewith to keep
him ; and in another minute he had
passed out of the house, and the door
was shut upon him. The interview which
was to have had such great results was
over.

We have heard it said of a pioneer
colonist, lessee of a Crown-land principality,
that, after bearing the reverses of fortune
which, with the advent of free selectors,
overwhelmed him, the loss of land and
stock and the accumulated treasure of
toilsome and prosperous years, with the
fortitude and equanimity of a gentleman,

he was broken down at last by the unspeakable
humiliation of the circumstance
that he had '' lived to hear himself called
a boss-cocks'*

Mrs. Reade had not only been defied
and defeated, and made to feel small and
ridiculous in her own drawing-room, where
never man or woman  man, especially 
had never dared dispute her supremacy ;
but she had lived to hear herself called,
or at any rate to find herself considered,
a gossip  a common tattler and busybody,
who intrigued in other people's private
affairs from the vulgar feminine love of
meddling  and the blow was equally
bitter.

She stood in the bow window of her
drawing-room, and watched the tall figure
leisurely striding through the garden as if
South Yarra and the adjacent suburbs

were but a small part of his possessions ;
taking in all the details of his strong majestic
figure, his thin, dark, proud face,
with its immense moustache, the perfection
of his quiet dress, and the repose
and dignity of his bearing generally,
and of every distinct movement that he
made  even when trying to open a
gate with a mysterious fastening, at
which most people fumbled and bungled
awkwardly.

But she was riot consumed with a
passion of angry resentment against him
for the indignities and humiliations that
he had heaped upon her. No, she was
filled with a vague but intense respect
and admiration for him, a feeling that
she had never before entertained for any
individual of his sex.

She did not say it to herself in so many
VOL. 111. 46

A MERE CHANCE.

words, but the thought of her heart undoubtedly
was that here was the man,
who as a husband, would just have suited
her.

Good-bye.

N that same day, at a little after
four o'clock in the afternoon*
Mrs. Kingston might have been
seen  she was seen, in fact  going into
the Town Hall by herself, having left her
carriage in the street below. She mounted
the stone steps lightly, with the train of
her dress held up in her hand, looking
exquisitely fresh and dainty in the dusty
sultriness that everywhere prevailed ; and
she glided through the vestibule as if time

462

were precious, paid her sixpence, and
entered the hall, where she took a solitary
seat under the shadow of the gallery at
the lower end.

The organist was interpreting Mozart
to some hundreds of receptive citizens,
making the great organ sing like a choir
of angels in the '* Gloria" of the Twelfth
Mass, "e in terra ajax, pax, pax omnibus ;
hon, once voluntas.  All the spacious
place was flooded with the impassioned
harmonies of that inspired theme.

Rachel was not what is popularly
called musical, but in the dulness of
her empty life her soul slacked its thirst
in this way, as a soul of a lower order,
which had been denied its natural
nourishment, might have found comfort
in the emotional stimulus of champagne
or brandy.

She could uot play well herself, but
she was like a fine instrument to be
played upon ; not one sweet phrase of
melody passed from her listening ear
to her sensitive heart without wakening
an echo that had the very divine afflatus
in it in response. And in this resonance
of enthusiasms and aspirations, dumb and
suffocated in the bondage of her artificial
life  in the sense of breathing spiritual
air, and freedom, though with a passion
of enjoyment that filled her with far
more pain than peace  she found the
one true luxury of her much-envied
lot.

Long ago  oh, so long ago ! ~ the music
of a violin had led her into enchantment,
as the Pied Piper of Hamelin led away the
children. To-day the music of the Town
Hall organ, speaking now in Mozart's

dramatic choruses, and again in Baptiste's
Andante in Gr, was a similar but a sadder
incantation.

She sat solitary in lier far-away chair,
with her feet on the rung of the one in
front of her, her hands, gloved to perfection,
folded in her lap, her delicate,
neat dress daintily adjusted, much as she
might have sat in the pew at church,
a model of matronly grace and propriety.


But who could tell, from the expression
of her quiet jose and her dreamy eyes,
what ineffable raptures and fancies, what
infinite longings and yearnings  nameless,
even to her own consciousness, but all
reminiscent of the blessed past  soared
out of captivity on the wings of those
alluring harmonies !

Who could see that in her heart she

was crying  crying bitterly  for the
poetry and the beauty that were lost out
of her life !

There was an interval of silence, during
which she sat quite still, looking at the
great organ-pipes, and seeing nothing;
and then there grew out of the hush the
delicious rhythm of the "Faust" waltz,
beating like a soft pulse through the
summer air.

What spell is there in the '' Faust"
waltz, or in any waltz, for one whose heart
is capable of receiving and responding to
the inspired message of Mozart ?

How can we tell ? But this wee know,
that those whose hearts are warm and
young  who understand how to love and
how to dance, and have done the two
things at the self-same moment  have
seldom any more power than they have

honest inclination to resist the subtle wiles
of this simple measure.

There is a vox human stop out in
whatever organ plays it, magnetic to the
human passions that memory and imagination
keep. Rachel did not ask why it
was, but she felt, as soon as the air began
to unwind itself from a confusion of sweet
sounds, and she heard the slow time
throbbing softly in her ears, that she did
not know how to bear it.

It filled her soul with a great wave of
suffocating emotion  it ran like an electric
current over all her sensitive nerves  it
contracted her white throat with a choking
pain that was like incipient hysteria  it
set abnormal pulses bounding in her brain.
She did not think of Adelonga, and the
hour when she and her true love had their
first and last waltz together.

'No definite picture of the past arose at
the magician's bidding, or if it did, she
shut her eyes to it. But she could not
help the forlorn rapture of longing for
that nameless something that was the
most precious of her woman's rights,
which fate and fraud had taken from
her, when the notes of this dreamy waltz
measure, so charged with passionate and
poetic associations, pulsed from the
heart of the organ into her warm young
blood.

Oh, my love ! my love !"  that was
the burden of the music which was not
set to words.

And she turned her face a little, and
saw Rodenn Dalrymple standing in the
doorway. He had come in quietly, and
was waiting, with his hat in his hand,
apparently for a pause in the performance.

which he did not wish to interrupt, but
really until he could find where someone
whom he was looking for was
sitting.

It was the first time she had seen him
since that October night when they had
parted in the moonlight under the walls
of the house that was now her home ; but
she had been, unknown to herself, expecting
him, and there was no shock in her
surprise.

She knew that he was looking for her,
when she saw his eyes travelling over the
rows of occupied chairs in the upper
division of the hall, and she longed to call
out to him,

"Rodennnn, Rodennnn, here I am !"

But not a dozen seconds passed before
he saw her far away from him in her
shadowy corner ; and when he saw her,

with that solemn eagerness in her face, he
knew but he said to himself he had
already known that, though she had
forsaken him, she had never done him
wrong.

Of course before the day was over
it was reported in various circles,
more or less select, that pretty Mrs.
Kingston, who had married an old
fogey for his money, was in the habit
of coming to the organ recitals alone
and unbeknown to her husband, in
order to enjoy clandestine flirtations
with younger and more fascinating
men.

It was also darkly whispered that the
favoured individual was a person who
made it his constant practice to run away
with married women, and to murder
their lawful spouses in sham duels

afterwards if they ventured to make any
objections.

But of all the human beings collected
in the Town Hall that afternoon,
perhaps no two were less capable of
violating the spirit of the moral and
social law whereof the letter is so
sacred to the ubiquitous and lynx-eyed
Mrs. Grundy, who persists in suspecting
everyone of a desire to evade or
infringe it, simply for the sake of doing
so, whenever he or she is presented with
an opportunity.

That they loved one another as
much as it was possible for sympathetic
hearts to love, and that they seized one
brief half-hour out of a lifetime of
separation in which to say farewell,
might have been reprehensible from the
conventional point of view ; but then

the conventional point of view does not
embrace the universe, bj a very long
way.

He came down the hall, and round
to her chair, and she drew her dress
close that he might sit down beside her.
She was too innately pure to make any
mere outward and artificial demonstrations
of modesty in such a moment
as this ; and she trusted him too well to
be afraid of him.

She put out her hand, and he took it
in a long, close clasp ; and they looked
at one another the while with loving,
despairing eyes, which said, " Oh, Rachel,
why did you?" and " Oh, Rodenn, forgive
me !" and bridged the only gulf that
could be bridged between them, without
any help of words.

And then, though the organ began to

fill the air with the sonorous crash and
thunder of Bach's great pedal fugue in
D, they heard nothing but the beating
of their hearts, and the memories that
called to them from their brief past,
vibrating through the void and silence
of a world in which they were alone
together.

When the music ceased for an interval,
Mr. Dalrymple rested his arm on the
back of the chair which had served
Rachel for a footstool, and looking into
her face, said under his breath,

Gordon gave me your message  I
came down to thank you  and I
thought we should get on better if
we could see each other just once.
Dear, we must try and comfort ourselves
with knowing that neither of us
played the other false."

"I did  I did," lie whispered
hurriedly. "I ought to have trusted
you, Rodenn."

 Yes that was a mistake. But you
did not know any better, poor child.
And they were too many for you,
those people. Gordon ought to have
insisted on seeing you, himself, or
getting some message to you, and not
have left you in their hands. But he
did his best, he says. He was too
anxious to get back to me to have
much patience over it, and he didn't
bargain for being told lies of that
magnitude in cold blood. However, 
however "

He broke off and looked at her with
a passion of love and grief in his eyes
that he dared not trust to speech. And
she looked back at him, with her

simple soul laid bare  longing to make
him know, if they were never to be
together like this again, how absolutely
in her heart she had been true to him.
She would not tell him a lie, at any rate.

Oh," he said in a sort of groaning
whisper, drawing a long hard breath,
oh, my little one, isn't it hard
lines !"

Don't," she gasped, feeling that
clutch on her throat tighten with a
sudden spasm ; '' oh, Rodenn, don't !"

And he straightened himself quickly,
and sat back in his chair. And the
organ began to play again  a stately
march of Schubert's, which acted like
a tonic on her disordered nerves, and
as a sedative to the hysterical excitement
that for a moment had threatened to
overmaster her.

The echoes of that march rang in her
ears, when Roche was gone back to
Queensland and this chapter of her
life was finished, for many a long
day.

And then at last the thunders of the
National Anthem brought the performance
to a close, and the audience
trooped out, casting curious glances as
they went at the distinguished-looking
couple standing conspicuously apart 
the tall stranger with the peculiar
moustache, who had soldier and gentleman
written on him from head to
foot, and the graceful young lady with
the lovely complexion and the irreproachable
French dress, whom nobody " who
was anybody" failed to recognise.

The two were left together amongst
all the empty chairs, in a silence that
VOL. III. 47

was liarcllj broken by the organist's
movements at the far end of the hall,
closing the stops and keys of his
enormous instrument.

"Well," said Mr. Dalrymple, looking
down upon his companion, who lifted
to his sombre eyes a pale but
solemn face, " well  so this is all, I
suppose !"

Her lips twitched a little ; she could
not answer him.

*' You are not sorry that I came, are
you, Rachel ? It will not make it harder
for you, will it?"

Oh, no, Eoden ! But it is you on
whom it is so hard  you will be so
lonely without me ! I can't bear to
think what I have brought on you
and sou had so many troubles
already !"

'' Not you, dear  not you. And I can
bear all my part of it, if only things go
well with you."

'' Why did you break that trace ?"
she exclaimed, with a touch of bitter
passion. " But for that  but for two
minutes lost  you would never have
seen me, and then I should never
have spoiled your life like this."

But, dear, we are not going to
regret that, I hope. We have got something
' saved from chance and change,'
if not much, that to me at any rate  yes
and to you too, I know  is worth even
this heavy price that we are paying for
it now. It need not spoil our lives,
Rachel, to know  what we know. It
is an agonising thing to see how
blessed it might have been for us, and to
be obliged to give it all up ; but I shall

472

never think of those two hours, when
we belonged entirely to each other  only
two hours, Rachel, out of our whole
lives !  without being thankful for the
chance which gave them to us. Yes, and
I think we shall be the better for them
I don't say happier, because I really
don't know what that word means 
but I think life will somehow have
a finer quality henceforth, whatever
happens, on account of those two hours.
Dear, I am forcing myself to give into
the hard fate that has done us out
of our inheritance ; but there is one
thing that I don't think I cotdd get
reconciled to  and that is to thinking
that you would ever live to wish
that we had never known each
other."
'' I could not wish it," she whispered ;

I could only try to persuade myself that
I did."

*' Do not try. You are under no

obligation of duty to do that. Try to

be happy with your husband  try not to

fret over what is irrevocable, and not

to hanker after what is hopeless. But

don't try to turn me out of the only

place in your life where I have a corner

of my own. Let me keep the little of

you that I have got it is little enough !

Do you remember what you said to me

that night ?  you said you had no rights

in my past. He has no rights in our

past. Keep it sacred, Rachel, for my

sake. That will not hurt anybody. You

are not afraid that such remembrances,

if you shut them away in your heart,

will militate against your efforts to do

what is right by him ? And you are not

afraid that I will ever tempt or trouble
you ?"

'' Oh, Rodenn, I am not afraid of you 
you well know that !"

Treat me as if I were dead," he
said gently. " If I had been killed that
time when I was thrown  if I were in
my grave now  I know how you would
think of me. You would not wish you
had never seen me then. That is how
I want you to think of me, Rachel'*

I know," she said, drawing a deep
breath. '' But to me  even if you had
killed yourself  to me you could never
be dead."

By this time they had sauntered slowly
out of the deserted hall and through the
empty vestibules, and were standing in
the doorway, looking out upon the street
below them.

The storm that had threatened in the
morning was gathering up. Heavy
clouds weighed upon the sultry air, and
gusts of wind were beginning to blow
the dust about ominously. Pedestrians
were hurrying to gain shelter before the
rain came on, but, as they passed, they
took note of the lingering pair, who were
apparently heedless of the warnings of
the elements, with more or less curious
eyes. Neither of them, it is needless to
say, minded in the least who saw them.
They had no desire to take even this last
good-bye clandestinely.

And when Rachel, to whom it had not
occurred to wonder why her carriage
was not in attendance, saw it thundering
alone the street towards her, it

or) '

was with as much relief as surprise
that she recognised her husband in it,

looking out of the window for
her.

We have said nothing," said Mr.
Dalrymple, who perceived the approach
of his old rival and enemy ; " and we
had so much to say."

Perhaps it is better not to say
much," said Rachel.

Perhaps so. But one thing you
must not mind my asking you  and I
know you will tell me truly  are you
getting along pretty well ? Do you
think you will be able to make anything
of a happy life out of it ?
That is my great anxiety."

Do not be anxious about me," she
replied. " I shall get along. I know
that you forgive me  that will help me
more than anything."

Don't talk about forgiveness, child 

it implies a wider separation than I
think has ever been between us.
There can be no forgiveness in the
case of people who never knowingly
do one another wrong."

The carriage, with its high stepping,
showy horses, began to slacken speed,
and they descended the long flight of
steps quietly, side by side.

"Is he good to you ?" inquired
Rodenn, quickly.

Very," she replied; " very, indeed."

And then they reached the pavement,
and the person referred to got out of
the carriage and came to meet
them.

It must be recorded, to Mr. Kingston's
credit, that he behaved like a
gentleman on this occasion. He was
a little acid and supercilious, and not

as composed as he assumed to be; but
otherwise he conducted himself with
propriety. " I took the carriage for
half an hour," said he loudly. " I hope
I haven't kept you waiting, my dear.
Ah, Mr. Dalrymple, how do you do ?
I did not know you were in town.
I hope you are quite well. Making a
long stay?"

'' A day or two only," said Eoden,
who stiffened in spite of himself, but
spoke with studied courtesy. " I shall
be starting back to Queensland to-night.
I am glad to have had the opportunity
of meeting Mrs. Kingston, and to see
her looking well"

Oh, yes, she is very well, I hope.
Travelling did her good it does everybody
good. I felt quite set up by it
myself. Dear me, was that a drop of

rain ? I think you had better be getting
home, Rachel. There is a heavy storm
coming directly. Good day, Mr. Dalrymple,
good day. We can't set you
down anywhere, I suppose ?'

Mr. Dalrymple declined a seat in the
carriage with thanks, and he held out
his hand to Rachel.

Good-bye," he said quietly.

Good-bye," she replied, with an ash-white
face. They looked at one another
for a second; and then, lifting his hat
gravely, Mr. Dairy male turned and
walked away down the street, and
Mr. Kingston gave his arm to his
wife, and led her to her carriage. Poor
Rachel! she did not ask herself what
would happen next  she did not wonder
nor care whether she was to be
scolded or not. For a few bitter, lonely

moments, she had no recognisable
future.

Then she turned to her husband, who
was fanning the fuel of his wrath in
silence, laid her hand on his arm, and
said softly, "Graham?"

Well  what ?" he inquired, roughly.

*' Do not be angry. I am never going
to see him again."

"It's to be hoped not," he snarled,
if you have any regard for your reputation.
Standing up there with him, in
that public way, for all Melbourne to
see !"

"You would not have wished me to
meet Mr. Dalrymple in any way that
was not public," she said, drawing herself
up. " And I should be very sorry
to do anything that all Melbourne might
not see."

The rain began to sweep down heavily,
and he turned to put up the window
nearest him with an energy that threatened
destruction to the glass.

And he said no more about Mr. Dairy
male.

Disturbed as he was, he was greatly
relieved that the meeting he had always
dreaded was over, and had taken place
so quietly ; and poor as was his estimation
of the abstract woman, he had
the most implicit faith in his wife's
sincerity.

When she told him that she had bidden
her old lover a final farewell, he believed
her ; and, though the sight and thought
of the man made him ferocious, he was
quite aware that difficulties were adjusting
themselves more satisfactorily than
he could have expected.

He did not feel that he had any
excuse for upbraiding Rachel now, and
he did not do it. But he had to put
great restraint upon himself not to doit.


He got out of the carriage at his club,
shutting the door with a bang behind
him, and while his wife drove home by
herself in a state of semi-consciousness,
he went in to quarrel with some of his
old friends who chanced to require his
opinion upon the political situation.
Politics, he promptly gave them to understand,
were beneath his notice,
likewise the people who concerned themselves
therein. He wouldn't touch one
of them with a pair of tongs. It
wasn't for gentlemen and clubmen to
mix themselves up with a lot of rogues
and vagabonds. Let them alone and be

hanged to them. That was what
respectable people did in America. If
Americans didn't care what riff-raff
represented them, why should they?

As for the colony, if it liked to be
dragged in the dirt if it preferred, of
its own free will, to go to the devil 
let it, for all to him.

And so he worked off his savage temper
harmlessly, and appeared in his own
drawing-room at seven o'clock, irreproachably
spruce, and with a flower in his
button-hole, looking jaunty and amiable,
as if nothing had happened.

Rachel, when he arrived, was sitting
alone in the midst of her wealth and
splendour, waiting for him.

She rose as he entered and went to
meet him, looking lovely in her favourite
black velvet, with red geraniums in her

hair; and she laid her hand on his
sleeve, and lifted a sad but peaceful
face. 'kiss me, Graham," she said
gently.

He put his arms round her at once.

Dear little woman !" he responded.
I understand. I am not angry with
you. It's all right. We won't say anymore
about it."

And he led her to the dining-room
and placed her " at the head of the
table," which was her social throne ;
and he plied her with dainty viands
and rare wines with a fussy solicitude
that was highly edifying to the
servants who waited upon them, byway
of showing her that he forgave
her.

He was much impressed by his own
large magnanimity; and what was more

to the purpose, so in lier unselfish heart,
was she. They spent the evening together,
f.ete-a-tete by the fireside (for it was cold
when the storm was over), in the most
domestic manner, planning new schemes
for the garden and for the arrangement
of a pet cabinet of blue china ; and
when Rachel went to bed, lighting her
way about the great corridors and staircases
with a candle that her husband
had lit for her, she felt that he was
helping her to make a fair start upon
the weary road which stretched, plain
and straight  but, oh, so flat and bare ! 
before her.

And she was very grateful to him.

Mr. Dairy male, meanwhile left town by
an evening train, and travelled night and
day until he reached his home in the
queensland wilderness, where, being

VOL. III. 48

liumaii  and very much so, too  lie unloosed
this heart from the restraints that
he had put upon it, and railed at ease over
the injustices of fate in the very strongest
language.

Why should I have done it?" he demanded
of his ancient friend and comrade
as they lounged in restful attitudes under
'the ffrass-thatched verandah of their
humble little house, smoking the pipe of
peace in the cool of the summer day.
Why should I have given her up to him ?
What right has he to keep her, while I am
lonely for the rest of my days ? He has not
the shadow of a right. She doesn't belong
to him, and she never will. There is no
binding force in any other contract that is
entered into by fraud and false pretences ;
why should there be in this which she
.has been dragged into, and which deprives

her as well as me, of all the flower
and sweetness of her life ? It is a
monstrous sacrifice  and as immoral as
it is monstrous.

It isn't as if we had no end of years,
no end of lives to throw away. Suppose,
ages hence, if we should survive, with
our human nature, and I, for one, don't
want to survive without it  and we Look
back upon this precious bit of certain happiness
that we might have had, and see
that we voluntarily gave up the whole of
it merely because of a wretched little
paper law  a miserable little conventional
prejudice  what shall we think of ourselves
then ? We shall say that we did not
deserve a gift that we did not know how
to value."

Rave away," said Mr. Gordon. " It

will do you good. All the same, you

-.48 2

know, as well as I do, that it would be
impossible for you to do less or more than
you have done."

Of course it was impossible. Few
people are better than they profess to be,
but he was one of those few. And if he
had had the happiness of twenty lives to
lose, he would have lost it all twice over
rather than have kept it at any cost of
peace or honour to the woman he loved.
He allowed himself the right to love her
still, which, as he justly remarked, couldn't
hurt anybody.

He thought of her as he rode about his
lonely plains, looking after black boys and
cattle, and dreamt of her as he lay out in
the starlight nights, with a saddle for his
pillow, and the red light of the camp-fire
flickering through the darkness upon his
face ; and always with a sense that,

spiritually and morally, she belonged,
before all the world to him.

But he never at heart regretted either
that he had seen her that day at the Town-hall,
or that he had elected to see her no
more. He had done the only thing that
it had been in him to do.

CONSOLATION.

F it is true, as it is said, and
as the observation of most of
us seems to testify, that the
ideal marriage is hardly ever realised,
and then only when the rare and
brief experience has been bought at
untold cost of precious years, it is,
perhaps, equally true that the majority
of marriages wrongly and recklessly
entered into, provided the contracting

parties are honestly disposed,
turn out surprisingly and unreservedly
well.

Time, which solaces our disappointments
and sanctifies our bereavements,
remedies also in a great
measure even these criminal mistakes.


As Rachel truly said, there are
whole worlds of things " besides love
i.e., " the love of man and woman
when they love their best "  to knit
husbands and wives together ; and,
independently of the ties that children
create, and which, to the mother at
least, are supremely and eternally
sacred, the innumerable soft webs of
habit and association that are woven
in days and years of intimate companionship

grow, like ivy over a fissure
in a wall, so strong as eventually not
only to hide the vacant place, but in
some degree to supply artificially that
element of stability and permanence to
the structure which in its essential
substance it lacked.

And so it was with Rachel. After
a little time, when she had " settled
down," changed and aged, and sobered
as she was, she really was not
unhappy.

She was always vastly conscious of
her loss, but she was of two wholesome
a disposition to be embittered
by it; and her simple sense of duty
and her characteristic unselfishness
prompted her from the first to wear
a cheerful face for her husband, and

never by word or deed to reproach
him, which course of conduct had
the natural result of comforting
herself quite as much as it gratified
him.

He was not a bad man, and in
his easy fashion, he loved her; and
appreciating her gentle and dutiful
behaviour, he put himself out of the
way to be kind to her, though,
with all his attentions, he never
was what one would call a domestic
husband.

Her demands upon him were not
exorbitant. Indeed, she was true to
her creed in not demanding anything ;
but for such evidences of his affection
as he voluntarily bestowed upon her
she showed herself always grateful

in a meek, pleased way that was very
charming to a man vain of his own
importance, and she did not profess
to be more so than, in her soft heart,
she really was.

She had no vocation for independence,
nor for making herself still less for
making others  miserable ; and if she
had married Bluebeard instead of a
well-intentioned gentleman, she must
have twined herself about him with
her tender, deferential, delicately-caressing
ways  which came as naturally
to her as breathing  and have
found support and rest in doing
it.

When all signs of storm had cleared
away, the apparently ill-matched husband
and wife settled down to a life

together that, if not rapturously delightful,
was quite as placid and kindly and
peaceful as the married life of most
of us.

They did not see a great deal of
each other, to be sure ; but the hours
that they spent together, being generally
hours when Mr. Kingston was tired
or unwell, and wanted to be nursed
and cheered, and to have the papers
read to him, had a homely sweetness
and solace for Rachel not far removed
from happiness.

And then I am afraid it must be
confessed that the house, and the
wealth and luxury belonging to it, did
comfort her a little.

She was excessively unpretentious in
her habits, and pure and simple in her

tastes, but lie had an intense appreciation
of all those delicate personal
refinements which womanly women
love, and only those who have money,
and plenty of it, can enjoy  of which
years of sordid poverty had taught her
the grace and value ; and it was not
possible to her, with her healthy sense
of life, to refuse, even if she had
wished, to absorb the fragrance and
brightness of her social and material
surroundings.

She revelled in her beautiful garden
and in her spacious and artistic rooms ;
she loved her piano and her books
and pictures, and her innumerable
pretty things ; she enjoyed her drives
and her rides, and her visiting and
her parties, and her operas and concerts,
and her shopping expeditions 

upon which no limitations were placed
by her husband, who liked her
to spend his money  with Laura and
Beatrice.

And, more than all, she delighted
in the power which her position gave
her of doing all kinds of helpful,
unpretentious service to the poor and
miserable, whom she seemed, by a sort
of divining-rod, to discover in the most
unexpected places.

Her husband would not allow her
to make her large subscriptions to the
public charities anonymously, nor would
he consent to her taking invalids of
the lower orders for drives, except
upon unfrequented roads and in a
generally surreptitious manner ; and he
strongly objected to her visiting poor

people's cottages, and running risks of
catching dirt and fever.

But she might make frocks for
ragged children, and bedclothes for
unprovided mothers, and scrap-books
for the Alfred Hospital ; she might
load her carriage with wine and chicken
broth every time she went out ; she
might spend a little fortune, as she
did, in helping on benevolent enterprises
of all sorts; and he only laughed
at her for being a soft-hearted little
goose, and triumphed over her whenas
happened in five cases out often
 she was proved to have been
more or less flagrantly imposed upon
and taken in.

Like most people who have badly
known the want of money, she was

decidedly extravagant in spending it
now that she had plenty; and, unlike
most husbands and wives in such
circumstances, she and Mr. Kingston
had no pleasant episodes in their
domestic life than those which had
reference to her financial embarrassments.


It was charming to him (since his
banking account was much too solid
to be easily affected by her operations)
to see her come, with her timid and
anxious face, to confess that she had
spent all her money, and to ask him,
with the sweetest wifely meekness, if
he could spare her a little more ; and
to her he never showed to better
advantage than when he declared,
so obviously without meaning it,

that she would ruin him, and then
gave her twice as much as she had
asked for.

She always flushed and glowed with
pleasure at this delicate and generous,
and gentlemanly way of doing things,
and would put her arms round his
neck and kiss him; and, naturally, he
would thereafter set forth to his
club, feeling proud of himself and
pleased with things in general, his
young wife and he being so thoroughly
in their right places in their relation
to one another.

And then there came to Rachel that
which to every true woman is the
greatest and dearest and best  save
one  of all life's many good things,
and which to her must inevitably have

made even the most loveless marriage
lovely : 

'' On the 17tli instep at Toorak, the
wife of Graham Kingston, Esq., of a
son."

This little notice appeared in " The
Argus," of the 18th, and caused a flutter
and sensation in all well-regulated
Melbourne households.

Dear me, how nice ! and a son,
too. How pleased Mr. Kingston will
be ! An heir to all that fine property
at last ! Dear me, how nice ! We must
call and make inquiries."

And when kind inquiries resulted in
the satisfactory information that both
mother and infant were progressing
favourably, society congratulated Mr.
Kingston with effusive and impressive

VOL. III. 49

cordiality, which that gentleman, deprecating
a fuss with airs of smiling indifference,
felt to be by no means more
than the occasion demanded.

Of comes, the interesting event
made a pleasant commotion in the
great Toorak house and in the Hardy
family.

Mrs. Hardy assumed the functions of
mother-in-law to Mr. Kingston, and
introduced him to his son and heir
with a genuine maternal pride, that
could not have been more touching
or more complimentary to either of
the delighted parents, had the featureless
little atom been a lineal fifth
grandchild.

The stately matron, as is the habit
of stately matrons under such circumstances,

put off her conventional armour
and rustled softly about the hushed
rooms, clothed in all the homely womanliness
of her own baby-nursing youth;
and Rachel, watching her from her
tranquil nest of pillows, forgave her 
as she had long ago forgiven her
husband  and wondered that she had
never understood before what a truly
sweet and loveable woman dear Aunt
Elizabeth was.

And Laura came up to see the
baby, bringing a wonderful high-art
coverlet for the cradle, and all sorts
of wise advice (based upon her exceptional
experience as the mother of
twins).

And Beatrice came  poor Beatrice,
who had no babies !  and held the tiny

492

creature for a long time in her arms,
looking with silent wistfulness at its
crumpled little face.

And by and bye, when E-achel was
promoted to gorgeous dressing-gowns
and a sofa in her boudoir, Lucilla
came to stay with her, full of importance
and responsibility (as the mother
of the largest family of them all),
to instruct her in the newest and
most improved principles upon which
an infant of quality should be
reared.

As if Rachel wanted showing how
to manage a baby ! Some ladies, as
the nurse sagely remarked, never had
any sense, but if Mrs. Kingston had
been a poor man's wife, which she
hoped she would excuse her taking

the liberty of speaking of such a thing,
she couldn't have took to the child
more naturally.

It speedily became apparent to others
besides that experienced woman that
maternity was Rachel's vocation, and,
when she found it, it seemed that she
had found a consolation, if not an
actual compensation, at last for the
great want and sorrow of her woman's
life.

Mrs. Hardy, watching the young
mother's passion of tender solicitude
for the baby that she could hardly bear
to have five minutes out of her sight,
told herself that, after all, the end
had justified the means ; and even Mrs.
Reade, who was most interested in this
latest experiment of a benevolent Fate,

came practically to the same conclusion.


One day she was alone with her
cousin. Rachel had been entertaining
a small and select circle at afternoon
tea in her own pretty room, and the
baby had been present, and she had
been pointing out to its father what
lovely eyes it had, and what small
ears, and what perfectly-shaped hands,
and how charming it was altogether 
much to Mr. Kingston's amusement, and
obviously to his immense satisfaction also ;
and now he had kissed her affectionately
and gone out, and the baby was taking
a siesta, and she was resting on her
sofa by the fireside, gazing at the bright
logs meditatively, with a half smile on her
face.

'' Tell me," said Beatrice, suddenly,
crossing the hearth and kneeling down
beside her ; " tell me, are you happy now,
Rachel ?"

Rachel lifted her soft eyes, shining with
a sort of vague rapture.

'' Oh, yes," she said, quickly ; " indeed
I am." And then in a moment her face
was overshadowed, and she looked in
the fire again with eyes that shone with
tears. " I am too happy," she said,
under her breath, " while he is alone and
sad."

Don't you think he will like you to
be as happy as possible ?"

"I know he will. But it lies on my
heart that he is desolate while I have
so many consolations. Beatrice, I was
reading some verses of Emily Bronze's

the other day, and they seemed to express
exactly how it is with me. Do you remember
them ?

' Sweet love of youth forgive, if I forget thee,
While the world's tide is bearing me along ;
Other desires and other hopes beset me,

Hopes that obscure, but cannot do thee wrong.'

Oh my love !" she broke out suddenly,
"I do not forget thee! And," she
added, more quietly, " I don't think
my being happy can wrong him,
Beatrice."

No, dear child, far from it," said
Mrs. Reade.

The little woman was not shocked,
nor was she dissatisfied with the
state of things that this naive revelation
disclosed to her. She was

deeply thankful to know that Rachel,
after all, was happy; but she was not
sorry to know also that she was to this
extent faithful to her true love, who had
dealt so well by her.

It was at this very hour that the
papers containing the announcement of
the baby's birth arrived at the Queensland
bungalow, and that Rodenn Dalrymple
learned what a change had
taken place, not only in the life and
welfare of his beloved, but in his own
lonely and empty lot.

The wife of Graham Kingston, of
a son." He knew as well as anybody 
better even than Rachel herself  what
that little notice meant. It meant that
the gulf already parting them had all at
once widened to an immeasurable extent.

He knew how it would be with that
tender and clinging heart  it would be
able to solace itself now, even for the
loss of him.

Yet he loved her well enough to be
pflad and thankful for the comfort that
had come to her, though the coming of
it left him doubly bereaved.

REPARATION.



UT, after all, Fate willed that
this marriage should be but
the chief episode in the story,

and not the story itself, of Rachel's

life.

One day, when she was flitting about
her o-reat drawings-room, with a basket
of flowers on her arm, singing soft airs
from "Don Giovanni" under her breath
as she busied herself with the arrangement

of little groups of leaves and
flowers in sundry precious receptacles
here and there, a footman entered with a
telegram.

'' That is from your master," said
Rachel, lifting it from the salver and
tearing off the envelope.

"Wait a moment, James, until I see
if there are any orders for you to take
out."

She put down her flowers on the
piano, read the brief message tranquilly,
and then lifted her face with a
smile.

"Ask Wilkinson to have the carriage
ready at three o'clock," she said ; " not
the brougham, if it keeps as fine as it
is now, the open carriage. And tell cook
I want to speak to her in half an hour.

Your master is coming home to-day
instead of Friday."

James said " Yes'm " and retired, and
his mistress continued her occupation of
arranging the flowers with more haste
and eagerness than before.

Mr. Kingston had gone from home
a few days previously to meet some distinguished
foreign visitors at a friend's
house in the country, a thing he did
not often do, and she had stayed behind
because little Alfred seemed to have
symptoms of a bad cold coming on 
which, however, had been happily checked
at that stage.

She had not expected her lord's return
just yet, but she concluded that he had
not found the party amusing, or had
been bored in some way, and so had

excused himself from prolonging his visit ;
and she was glad of the accident, whatever
it was, that was bringing him back
so soon.

In the afternoon she went upstairs
to get reads to go to the station to
meet him. It was winter, and she
clothed herself in rich furs  sealskin
and sable, with the sealskin cap of old
days on her shining head  against which
the soft roundness of her cheek and
throat, and the blush-rose delicacy of
her complexion was particularly distinct
and striking, and also the evident fact
that, far from pining away, she had
developed in health and strength
quite as much as in beauty during
the five or six years of her married
life.

When she was dressed she went to
the nursery, where her little boy
ran to meet her, begging her to
take him with her wherever she was
going.

She caught him up in her arms and
looked irresolutely at the imposing
nurse, who was responding to his
appeal in an official and determined
manner, telling him that he must not
cry to go in the carriage to-day ; he
must go for a nice walk with his nurse,
because his dear papa did not like to
be bothered with little boys when he was
driving with his dear mamma (which was
very true).

'' Never mind, Alfy," said Rachel,
hugging him to her maternal bosom,
and covering his fair little face  which

was very like her own  with kisses ;
You shall go with mother next time,
my sweet. Don't cry, dear little man !
Suppose mother brings him home a
pretty new toy? What shall mother
bring Alfy home, nurse, eh ?"

''I don't want toys, I want to go with
you, mother," wailed Alfy.

Oh, well, I think he might," said
Rachel, weakly. "It is a fine afternoon,
and he would enjoy it so ! And
his father hasn't seen him for four days.
Dress him quickly, nurse, and I'll take
him. You needn't come to-day, I can
look after him quite well by myself for
once."

Alfy was accordingly dressed, his nurse
performing that operation silently, with
a mien of severe disapproval, and his

mother kneeling on the floor and helping
her.

When he was ready  looking, Rachel
thought, more nearly like an angel than
ever child looked before  he was carried
downstairs in her own caressing arms,
resting his curly head on her sable collar,
and clasping his mites of hands round
her white throat ; and she placed him in
the carriage beside her, and tucked up
his little legs in the soft bearskin, and
they set forth together to Spencer Street
in a state of beatific satisfaction and
enjoyment, slightly qualified by Rachel's
well-founded apprehension that her husband
would scold her for spoiling
the child and making a nursemaid of
herself.

When Mr. Kingston arrived at the
VOL. III. 50

station, closely muffled in overcoat and
comforters, it was evident to Rachel's
experienced eye  or ear rather, for as she
knew he would object to her waiting
unattended on the platform, she stayed
in the carriage and sent the footman
to meet him at the train and to take
his baggage, and so heard him before
she saw him  that he was in anything
but a good temper.

He rated an unfortunate porter who
drove a barrow in his way in unnecessarily
violent terms, and then he
demanded angrily of his servant why
the dickens they hadn't brought the
brougham for him on such a bitter day.

''Oh, Graham," said Rachel, stretching
out her hand, " how do you do, dear? I
am so sorry !  but I thought you would

like the open carriage best. It was beautifully
mild when we started it lias been
quite a warm day. And here is Alfy
come to meet you. He is quite well,
again, you see, and such a good little boy,
aren't you, Alfy ? He is taking care of
his mother to day, and sitting so quietly."

Why did you bring him out in the
cold?" responded the father snappishly.
'' And where' s the nurse ? At home ?
Upon my word, Rachel, we might as
well be spared the expense of servants
altogether, for all the use you make of
them. No, I won't kiss him  I might
2:ive him a sore throat."

Have you a sore throat, dear ?" inquired
Rachel meekly, tucking the child
into her own corner of the carriage, and
whispering to him to sit very still.

50-2

I should rather say so  not so much a
sore throat, perhaps, as a general bad cold
the most confounded bad cold I ever
had in my life. I'm regularly seedy and
done up," grumbled Mr. Kingston, climbing
into his seat beside her.

Oh, dear, I'm so sorry !"

'that is why I have come home today,"
he added. " It's the most wretched
thing to be in other people's houses when
you don't feel well."

Indeed it is," assented Rachel sympathetically
; " and I am very glad you came
back. How did you catch it, do you
think ?"

'' I think I must have got it before I
started. But that idiot Lambert sent
an open trap to meet me  you know
what a pouring wet day it turned out ?

and I had to sit and be soaked for
an hour and a half. Umbrellas were no
good in that rain, and there was a
sharp wind, too, and before we reached
the house  great, cold barrack of a
place, with stingy little coal fires  fancy
coal fires !  shows what an idiot the
fellow is, and she's worse  before we
got there I was thoroughly wet through,
and chilled to the bone. I never was
so cold in my life. I took a hot bath
before I dressed for dinner, and I got
Lambert to send me up some brandy,
but it was no use  it seemed to have
regularly struck into me. I could get
warm  not till about the middle of the
night, and then I felt as if I'd got a
fever. I believe I have too."
Oh, Graham, I hope not."

It has settled on my chest," he went
on. *' I haven't been able to sleep for
coughing  you know I have never had
a cough in my life  and I can't draw
a breath without feeling as if I was
dragging something up by the roots.
Can't you hear how I breathe ? You
never heard me breathe like that before
did you ?"

Rachel turned her blooming face, now
grave and anxious, to listen to his respiration,
which certainly was strangely
quick and laboured, and noisy, and she
was struck by a great change in Ms
since she had seen it four days ago.
It had become all at once wrinkled,
and hollow, and haggard  the face of
an old man.

Oh, my dear," she exclaimed, in an

accent of genuine distress, '' you have
got a bad cold, indeed ! Hadn't you
better call on the doctor at once  it
won't be much out of our way  and
see what he says about it ? It may be
nothing, but I think it seems like bronchitis,
and it is best to be on the safe side."

"I think I will," said Mr. Kingston,
covering his mouth with his wraps
again. '' It seems worse than it was
when I started  the cold day, I suppose.
Hang it, I wish you had brought the
brougham  it is colder than ever !"

And he shivered under an accumulation
of great-coats and furs that one would
have thought sufficient for the temperature
of polar regions.

The carriage was stopped in Collins
Street, and remained in the doctors'

quarter until little Alfy fell asleep, and
was temporarily put to bed under the
long, soft skirt of this mother's jacket.
Then, as the dusk was falling, Mr.
Kingston came back to his place, and
tremulously commanded the coachman
to drive home as fast as he possibly could.
He says it is inflammation of the
lungs, Rachel," he whispered excitedly,
and that I must go to bed at once.
Only a touch he called it, but he didn't
look as if he thought it a touch. He
is coming up to-night to do something.
He says I ought to have come home
the first day, and not have let it run
on. Inflammation of the lungs that
is a dreadful thing, isn't it? I have
never had it, but I have heard of it 
it's a most dangerous complaint !"

Oh, no, dear, not dangerous, except
when people are careless," said Rachel
soothingly, taking his hand under the
fur rug and clasping it between her
own. "And now you are home, with
me to nurse you, you will soon get
all right. Many people have it slightly
it is quite a common thing with a
bad cold but when they are well
nursed and taken care of, they soon get
all right again.

*' Good little woman ! you will take
care of me, T know."

'' Indeed I will," she responded, slipping
up one hand under his arm, and
resting her cheek on his coat-sleeve. " I
wish you had come back to me before.
But, once I get you fairly into my hands,
I'll soon nurse you round."

However, though she did all that a
woman and a wife, and one born to bethe
genius of a sick room, could do,
she did not nurse him round. By the
time he reached home, where the household
was thrown into a panic of consternation,
he was very ill indeed  his
fright about himself helping very much
to develop the bad symptoms rapidly ;
and the doctor, who next day summoned
other doctors in consultation upon the
case, pronounced him  not in words,
but by unmistakable signs  to be ina
serious and critical condition. The
attack had been severe from the first;
it had been allowed to run on for
several days ; and the constitution of
the patient, enervated and shattered by
years of unwholesome indulgence, was

as little fitted to stand an illness as any
constitution could be. The pain in
breathing grew worse and worse, and
the fever hotter and drier; and then
stupor came on, and delirium, and exhaustion,
and by and bye a filmy cloud
over the sunken eyes, and a dusky
pallor over the old, old, wrinkled face;
and, in spite of all the doctors, and all
the nurses, and all that money could do
in spite of the agonised devotion of
his young wife, who never left him for
more than five minutes at a time,
taking snatches of sleep only when he
slept, sitting by the bedside, and resting
her tired head on the same pillow
that she smoothed for his  it was over
in less than a week. And a little
paragraph appeared in " The Argus" one

morning, to shock that small world of
which he had so long been a distinguished
ornament, with the incomprehensible
intelligence that he was 'gone,"
and would never be seen at a club
mess or in a festive drawing-room
again.

On the night of his death, when fever
and pain and restlessness were sinking
away with the sinking pulse, and when
Rachel, watching beside him, thought
he was past knowing anyone  even
her  he looked at her with a gleam
of loving recognition. " Good little
woman !" he muttered in a struggling
whisper. "Dear, good little woman!"

She stooped over him at once with
a yearning passion of pity and vague
remorse, and kissed him, and laid her

white arms about him, raining tears on
his dying face and his cold limp hands.

Oh, Graham, Graham, I have not
been good enough to you !* she cried.
And you have been so good  so
kind  to me !"

He continued to look at her with dull
wistful, pathetic eyes.

Have I ?" he gasped, feebly.
Have I ?"

And then the gleam died out of his
face in the shrouding darkness that
was creeping over him. He was
quiet for several minutes, and Rachel
laid her cheek on the pillow beside
him, and listened to the faint
rattle which now and then told
that the '' step or two dubious of
twilight' ' between sleep and death

was not yet crossed, motioning the
other watchers away from the bedside,
that he and she might be alone
together.

And suddenly he roused himself, and
said  panting the * words out slowly
and huskily, but evidently with
a perfect consciousness of their meaning
'' Rachel  you can  have him  now."

Her arm was under his pillow, and
she drew it back to her gently until
his head lay next her breast.

Hush  hush  hush !" she said, with
choking sobs. But he went on
steadily, as if he had not heard her.

Only tell him  not to  not to  lead
little Alfy  into bad ways."

After a pause, he said,

Do you hear !  tell him  "

'' He will not  he could not !" she
broke out eagerly. '' He is a good,
good man, though people think he is
not ! He will take care of little Als j,
mj darling  do not be afraid  he will
never lead him into bad ways  never
never !"

Ought she to have said it ? Had
she given him  she, who, at this moment,
would have laid down her life to
save his, if that had been possible  the
comfort .she had meant to give, or a
most cruel, cruel stab, in his last conscious
hour ? She looked at him with
agonised, imploring face, which mutely
prayed him to try and understand her;
and there came slowly into his sunken
eyes a vague intelligence and a dim,
dim smile. He did understand her 

A MERE CHANCE.

better, perhaps, than he had ever understood
her before.

'' Good little woman !" he murmured.
Good little girl to tell the truth."

m

c

FULFILMENT.

ACHEL, who could not have
dissembled if she had tried,
appeared to be overwhelmed
by Mr. Kingston's sudden death.

She wept herself ill, sitting now in his
library chair, now in his office, now in
his dressing-room, with mementoes of
his domestic occupations and the homely
companionship of nearly half-a-dozen
wedded years around her; missing him

VOL. TII. 61

from his accustomed place with a sense
of having lost one of the best and
kindest husbands that ever ungrateful
woman had.

She allowed no one to touch his clothes
and trinkets, or his books and pipes, or
anything that he had used and cared
for, but herself ; and she cried over them,
and kissed them, and laid them away
in sacred drawers, to be treasured relics
and heirlooms for her little Alfy, who
was to be taught to reverence the
memory of the tenderest of fathers, and
to hand down to unborn generations
the name and fame of the most accomplished
and estimable of men.

She wandered about her great, silent
house, in and out of the spacious rooms,
making loving inventories of all the

ricci appointments, which lead never

lead so much grace and beauty as
now.

He built this lovely place for m,"
she would say to herself, or perhaps say
aloud to Beatrice, who was her chief
companion at this time, '' He had this
carved dado made because I didn't like
tiles;" *'he gave me this Florentine
cabinet on my twentieth birthday ;" '' he
chose these hangings himself because he
said they suited my complexion." Every
bit of the house and its furniture was
newly sanctified by some of these reminiscences.


She gathered together all his letters
reverently  some had been waiting for
his return from Mr. Lambert's, and were
still unopened ; and though many of them

61-2

were addressed in the kind of handwriting
that was especially calculated
to arouse curiosity, she would not pry
into his correspondence, nor allow anyone
else to do so.

She would not read what he had
evidently never intended her to read ;
she burnt them all without taking
one of them out of its envelope, and
then drove to the cemetery with a wreath
of flowers for his grave.

He was the best of husbands," she
said, when to her own people she talked
ofTiim.

And Mrs. Hardy, who was truly
afflicted by the family bereavement, was
comforted to be able to repeat this
tender formula to all the gossip of her
own circle.

He was the best of husbands. So
fond of her to the last ! Even when
he was delirious you could see plainly
his distress when she went out of the
room, and his relief when she came
back again. And she was so devoted !
Such a thoroughly suitable marriage in
every way  as if they had been made
for each other ! She is broken-hearted
for the loss of him. And how he valued
her he has plainly proved."

And here the gossips would smile
decorously, and shake their heads, and
say, 'eyes, indeed." For they all understood
what this allusion meant. It meant
that Mr. Kingston had left the half of
his great property absolutely at his young
wife's disposal, and that she was the
sole and unrestricted trustee of the rest,

which, was settled upon his son; which
certainly did prove that he had valued
her in the most conclusive manner.

But in a little while  a scandalously
little while indications that this young
widow of twenty-five was not inconsolable
for the loss of her elderly husband,
became apparent to all but the most
superficial observers.

It was not that she wore such very
slight mourning soft black silks and
cashmeres that were the merest apology
for weeds  for everybody knew that
Mr. Kingston had had a horror of crape,
and had been repeatedly heard to declare
that no wife of his should wear it if
he could help it.

Mrs. Hardy had explained that it was
in deference to his wishes that she had

defied custom id this respect ; and,
though there was a strong impression
that she ought to have insisted on paying
proper respect to his memory, ia spite
of him  and even that his protests
against conventional suttee were never
intended to include this particular case
(as was very probable), but only indicated
his personal distaste for harsh and unbecoming
materials in ladies' apparel 
the fact that it was growing the fashion
to be lax and independent in these
matters, saved her the verdict of the
majority.

And it was not that she drove about,
within two months of his death, with
her veil turned back over her bonnet
in the case of a veil so transparent,
it didn't make much difference whether it

were up or down  leaving her youthful,
lovely, rose-leaf face exposed to public
view as heretofore.

It was not that she was heartless or
unfeeling, or that she infringed the laws
of good breeding and good taste in any
distinctly and visible manner.

No one could quite say what it was,
and yet everyone felt that the fact
was sufficiently indicated that she
was recovering from the shock of
her sudden and terrible bereavement
with unexpected, if not unbecoming,
rapidity.

You mark my words," somebody
would say to somebody else, when Mrs.
Kingston's carriage went flashing by, and
she turned to bow to them, perhaps with
her serene, sweet, grave smile ; " you

mark my words  that woman will be
married again by this time next year.
I don't know what makes me think so,
but I am sure of it. There is a lookin
her face as if she were going to make
herself happy."

The person addressed, being a man,
would probably reply that the odd thing
would be if she did not make herself
happy (and generally he suggested that
by remaining a widow she would be
most likely to secure that object), with
youth and beauty, leisure and liberty,
and ten thousand a year to do what
she liked with ; and that he sincerely
hoped she would be.

Being a woman, she was more likely
than not to look after Rachel and her
carriage with solemn severity, and wonder

how it was that that poor, dear, foolish
man never could see that the girl cared
nothing at all about him, and had only
married him for his money.

Mrs. Hardy was becoming aware of
this state of public opinion with respect
to her niece's conduct  which had been
so extremely proper hitherto  and was
herself conscious of the subtle change
that had taken place, and was
uneasily wondering what it indicated,
when one day Rachel came to see
her.

It was eleven o'clock on a warm
summer morning, just before Christmas;
and the young widow walked over
through the gardens and the back gate,
wearing a light, black cambric dress
and a shady straw hat, looking  Mrs.

Hardy thought, glancing up at her from
her writings-table in a cool corner of
the now transformed drawing-room 
unusually well and strikingly young and
girlish.

Well, my dear, how are you ? And
Where's Alfy ? Have you not brought
him with you ?"

Rachel put her arm over her aunt's
shoulder, and kissed her affectionately.

I haven't brought him to-day, because
I wanted to have a little quiet
talk," she said. " Are you very busy,
auntie ?"

Mrs. Hardy was busy she always was,
from breakfast until lunch time ; but
she was impressed by a certain gentle
gravity in Rachel's voice and manner,
and understood that there was something

of importance to be attended to. So lie
gathered up her papers, told her visitor
to take off her hat and sit down,
and inquired anxiously what was the
matter.

There is nothing the matter," said
Rachel, with a little hesitation. " But,
auntie dear, I am going to  do something,
and I would not do it without
telling you first."

She sat upon the edge of a chair, and
leaned her arms on a corner of the
writing-table; and she looked into the
elder woman's face with wistful, longing,
pleading eyes.

Mrs. Hardy had faint, instinctive premonitions.


"Well, my dear," she replied a little
brusquely, " I shall be glad to advise

you to the best of my power. But you
are your own mistress now, you know."
Then after a little pause, lie said
anxiously, " What is it you are going
to do ?"

Auntie," faltered Rachel, " auntie 
you know all about Mr. Dairy male ?"

Rachel  my dear  you don't mean to
say  ! And your poor husband not six
months in his grave !"

"Not yet," said Rachel, suddenly
becoming composed and collected.
'' Though I do not believe that I ought
to put it off. But presently, auntie 
as soon as you would think it right
I want to marry Mr. Dalrymple. And
in the meantime he is waiting for me
to send him a message  he has asked
me to write  we want to have

the comfort of some sort of
recognised engagement, if it is ever so
quiet "

Oh, Rachel, don't ask me to have
anything to do with such a thing !
Only think what poor Graham would
say if he could know ! And he left
little Alfy in your hands  and he
left all that money to you  Freethinking
what you would do with
it!"

He knew  he knew," said Rachel.
He has already sanctioned it. Dear,
good husband ! He left me the money
without any conditions if I married again,
and he knew I should do this. It was
understood between us when he died.
Aunt Elizabeth, I think he wished to
make reparation to Rodenn and me.

Don't you wish it, too ? Only think,
it is six years  six whole years  that
poor Rodenn has been lonely in Queensland,
without any brightness or comfort
in his life ; and, though he has loved
me just the same, he has never
attempted to do  what you would not
have wished him to do  all that time.
It is six years this very week, Aunt
Elizabeth, since he sent Mr. Grordon
down to you."

And if he had come himself," said
Mrs. Hardy, passionately, beginning to
break down and cry, *' I should not
have let him see you  I would not
have allowed you to have him. Oh,
child, child ! when you have grownup
daughters to look after and manage
for, you will understand that I tried todo

mj best for you  you will think less
hardly of me then."

Rachel jumped up from her chair,
and kneeling down flung her warm
young arms about the sobbing woman.

"My own auntie," she exclaimed
fondly, "if I could think hardly of
you I should be ashamed to live. I
know you tried to do your best for me
of course I know it ! It is always
a mistake to deceive people, but I
deceived yoii too, not telling you all I
had done. I know you were right to
keep me away from him knowing only
what you knew. If he had been wicked,
as you thought, and I had had it all
my own way, what would have become
of me? But now  now that you know
he is good "

'' Ah, my clear, I clout know it !
Remember that dreadful duel ! And how
can sou tell that he doesn't want
sou now for your money ? He has
none of his own, and you have a
great fortune that he could squander
as he liked. Everyone will say
that it was for the sake of your
money."

It would sooner have been that
the money would have kept him
from me," said Rachel softly. " Once
I was afraid of that. But afterwards
I was ashamed that I could
have any fears. We understand
each other better. Aunt Elizabeth,
Beatrice knows that he is good 
Beatrice believes in him  and my dear

Graham gave me leave to make him
VOL. III. 62

happy. Won't you consent to it,
too?"

' Well, if poor Graham gave you leave
it is not for me to interfere, I suppose.
But you ivon't let anyone know
you are engaged so soon ?"

It need only be known to ourselves,
auntie."

And you'll promise me you won't get
married again under the year, at the very
earliest?"

"Yes, dear Aunt Elizabeth, I will
promise you that. If I can go and
stay at Adelonga for a little, and take
Alfy "

Is he down at the Digbys ?"

'' Yes, auntie."

'' Perhaps that will be the best
plan," said Mrs. Hardy, sighing. '' It



is a quiet place, and out of the
way, if only Lucilla doesn't gossip
about it''

CHAPTER XL

CONCLUSION.

ES. Henley was a little
scandalised like her mother, at
first, not by Rachel's desire to
marry again  for that she should do
so, as a rich young widow of twenty-five,
"left" by a husband just forty
years her senior, was generally anticipated
as a matter of course  but by
the too early announcement of those
wishes and intentions which conventional

decorum forbade a woman to dream of
until " the year " was up.

Very speedily, however, she forgot to
be shocked by anything of this kind,
and devoted herself ardently to the
furtherance of her cousin's happiness.


She had had Mr. Dalrymple at
Adelonga after his accident, and had
nursed him for about a month of his
convalescence ; and since that time both
she and John had had a strong
feeling of friendship for him, not
much less than that which they
had always had for their favourite, Mrs.
Digby.

They had condoned all the errors of

his earlier years (even the great duel,
which Mr. Gordon had assured them

was the worst episode in a reckless
but not dishonourable career, and was
in itself unstained by any mean or
vicious motives), and they had proved
the sincerity of their respect and
regard for him by allowing their son
Bruce to " chum " with him in Queensland.


And now, being put in possession of
all the facts relating to his and Rachel's
love affairs, Lucilla entered eagerly into
the arrangements which Rachel herself,
without a blush of shame, suggested for
bringing the long-parted lovers together
again.

Oh, yes my darling," she wrote hurriedly,
by return of post, " pray do
come and spend all the summer with
us. Mamma says that as it is so very,

very soon we must be careful to keep
it quite quiet, but John wishes me particularly
to tell you that, in his opinion,
you are quite right.

We both like Mr. Dalrymple very
much, and we think he has behaved
so very lull. And John says he is
not at all a spendthrift now, whatever
he ray have been once, and
he thinks really that he will take care
of your money and not squander it
away (only he says you must let him
arrange things for you on your marriage
which must take place at Adelonga  so
as to be quite on the safe side) ; for
they have had both floods and droughts
very badly at their place in Queensland,
and yet they have made it pay,
which John says he never expected.

Bruce thinks so much of the property
and the way it has been managed, that
I am sure he will want to go in with
Mr. Gordon if Mr. Dalrymple will let
us buy him out (perhaps he ivo'ibH now
the meat-freezing is going to do such
great things.) But these are details
to talk of presently. We must get you
here first.

If you can come on Tuesday,
do. John will meet you at the
train. I have written to Mr. Dalrymple
to come the next day, for you must
not be excited and upset until you
have had time for a good rest after
your journey. I am having the blue
south room got ready for you  the
one you tired to like  and the large
dressing-room next to it for dear

little Alfy. I don't think you ought

to send away your maid. Won't it

look odd after being used to one for

so long ? I have plenty of room

for her as well as for the nurse,"

&C.5 &c.

On the Tuesday, Rachel, with Alfy and

his nurse, arrived, having dismissed
some of her servants and put the rest
on board wages, having packed up her
most precious china and art treasures,
and swathed her splendid upholstery in
sheets of brown holland, prepared
to spend any length of time at
Adelonga that circumstances would
admit of.

It was a beautiful day in January,
rather too hot for travelling in comfort,
but pleasant and breezy about the

Adelonga-liills and the bosky garden
that sheltered the old house. It was
the same old house still, Rachel was
thankful to see. Mr. Thornley had been
building with brick and stone in town,
and so had been content to leave to his
country seat, the picturesque charm of
its wooden walls and its medley of
low roofs and gables ; and now it
stood embowered in cool vine leaves
and sweet-scented creepers, with great
trees of pink oleander, which loved the
sultry midsummer, nestling up against
it, and making broad splashes of sunny
colour amid the sombre richness of evergreen
shrubs a sort of earthly paradise
in Rachel's eyes. Lucilla was standing
on the verandah, surrounded by all her
family (except her grown-up step daughter,

Isabel, who had been sent on a visit
to an aunt in Sydney to be " out of the
way)" waiting to greet her welcome
guest ; and Rachel, jumping down from
the buggy, and flinging herself into
those faithful arms, felt that she had
been a wandering prodigal in strange
countries for half a dozen years,
and was on the threshold of home
again.

But, oh," she said to herself, when
having seen little Alfy tucked up in
his cot, and having, madness, with her
own hands, laid away her clothes in
drawers and wardrobes, she began to
dress for dinner, " ivhat could have
made Lucilla imagine that waiting for
him for twenty-four hours would rest
me?"

The long hours passed, however, as
the longest hours do, and the evening
of Wednesday drew on with a flaming
crimson sunset; and Rachel listened
for the sound of buggy wheels on
distant bush tracks, and was deafened
by the noise of her own loud-beating
heart.

They are coming," whispered Lucilla,
creeping with the stealth of a conspirator
into her cool, dim drawing-room,
where the young widow stood,
bright-eyed and pale, in her black
gown, steadying herself with a hand on
the piano.

Shall I send him in to you by himself,
dear, or would he think that was
bad taste  a too open and vulgar way
of recognising the state of affairs ?"

Ob, no, lie would think not it vulgar,"
replied Rachel, smiling sightly through
her air of solemn and rapt abstraction.
You must send him by himself, Lucilla,
please  this once."

The buggy came into the garden and
passed the window. Lucilla, outside on
the verandah, welcomed her guest with
effusive inquiries after Mrs. Digby's health
and welfare, and that of all the little
Digbys' respectively ; Mr. Thornley gave
loud directions to the servants about
the portmanteau that was to be carried
to the green gable room. And then the
buggy went to the stable-yard ; there
was a few minutes' silence; and the
door of the drawing-room opened
quietly, and Rodenn Dalrymple came
in.

He had changed a little in the four
years since she had seen him last; his
ruddy moustache was a little more
grizzled, and the lines in his sustained
forehead were stronger and
deeper.

She was changed, too; there was a
matronly grace and maturity in the
roundness . of her shapely figure and in
the reposeful softness of her face, that
had been wanting in the beauty, fresh
and delicate as he remembered it, of her
earlier girlish years.

But the only change they recognised
in one another was their deeper capacity
for understanding the worth and the
meaning of such an experience as this,
when, with his back against the closed
door, and her hands about his neck, he

held lier in both arms clasped close to

bis breast, and they drank together in

one moment of speechless passion the

solace and the sweetness of all the kisses

that they should have had.

   

In the evening Lucilla sat down to the
piano, to play some of Beethoven's
sonatas to her husband. It was a lovely
moonshine summer night, and some of
the windows stood open, letting in the
fragrance of jessamine and tobacco,
and a quantity of tiny moths and
gnats.

Mr. Thornley, having taken his coffee
and his cigarette upon the verandah,
lying all along on a bamboo easy chair,
stayed there to listen and doze in
obscurity, with his handkerchief thrown

over his bald head to keep off the
mosquitoes.

For a few minutes Mr. Dalrymple stood
behind his hostess; but, finding that she
played from memory, and therefore did
not want leaves turned over for her, he
left the piano, and crossing the room,
stooped down to Rachel as she satin
a low chair dreamily fanning
herself.

"Rachel," he whispered, "is the
lapageria in blossom now?"

"I don't know, Rodenn  I don't think
so," she replied.

Shall we go and see ?"

She rose at once, and they went
together into the curtained alcove and
through the noiseless swing door.

Where is our seat ?" he said, taking

her hand as soon as they were alone,
and leading her down the dim alleys,
over-arched with fern trees, and filled
with broken shadows of the gigantic
fronds. " I hope it is in the same
place."

It was in the same place, but the
place was stiller and darker than it used
to be  built all round and about with
gnarled masses of cork, feathered in
every crevice with maiden hair, and
roofed with drooping leaves.

There was just moonlight enough to
enable them to find it, and when they
found it they sat down side by side,
and Rachel laid her head on one of
her lover's broad shoulders and her
hand on the other; and they remained
there for several minutes without moving*

VOL. III. 53

or speaking; listening to the far-off
sound of the piano, more perfectly at
rest than either of them had ever
imagined it possible to be in this
world.

Mr. Dalrymple spoke first, drawing a
long breath.

Must we be separated any more,
Rachel ? Can't we be married now  this
week  tomorrow  and go away from
everybody quietly ? It seems like tempting
Providence to lose sight of one
another again  to lose one hour
more than we can help of what
we have been kept out of all this
time."

It does  it does," assented Rachel.
But I promised Aunt Elizabeth that I
would be a widow for a year."

You were a widow for me  low many
years r

*' I know, Rodenn, I know. I do not
do it willingly. But other people  other
things  have to be considered."

Six months more ! Child, no one has
any right to demand such an enormous
sacrifice of us. Who knows how lons
we may live to be together as we want
to be together ? Can we afford to
throw away six months on the top of
six years for the sake of mere sham
propriety, knowing the worth of every
hour as we do ?"

*'Roden," said Rachel gently, after a
pause, "it shall be just as you like. If
you think we ought not to wait,
we will not. I can explain to Aunt
Elizabeth."

And then he recognised his responsibilities.


'' No," he said, " I think perhaps we
had better wait  though there is no
sense or justice in it. We'll pay Mrs.
Grundy the heaviest price that she has
swindled honest people of for many a
day, and then we'll take it out with
interest. But you will do something
for me in the meantime ?"

*' There is nothing I could do for you
that I should not want to do for myself,
Rodenn."

You won't go quite away, will you ?
You'll stay here till I have to leave,
and then you'll come and stay a long
while with Lily? You'll let me have
sight of you, and keep watch over you,
until the waiting time is up ?" There



was no answer required for this question.
What they could do for one another
they would, as both well knew. He
held her tightly in his arms, covering
half her face with his great moustache.
'' And when the time is up we will
not wait one hour not one," he said,
with sudden, strong passion. '' That very
day, Rachel, I shall take you away to
Queensland, where nobody can reach
us and nothing can interfere with us.
When at last I do get you, I will
have you  for a little while at all
events  absolutely and wholly to myself."


And Rachel prayed that she might
be permitted to Hve until that "little
while " should come.

It seemed, in this moment of anticipation,

something that it would be

presumptuous for a mortal woman to

hope for, much less to expect.

   

And should Love, when all is said
and done, be the ruler and lord of
all-supreme arbiter of the destinies
of purblind creatures, not one in ten,
perhaps not one in fifty, of whom
have the faculty to see him and know
him as he is ?

Should the passion of wayward girls
defy the wisdom and wishes of parents
and guardians, who have learned in
long years of costly experience something
of the potentialities of this many-sided
life?

Should all risks of poverty and social
ignominy, with their long train of

trials and temptations, involving the
welfare of innocent relatives and unborn
children, be dared in an irrevocable
moment of enthusiasm for one's
faith in the eternal fidelity of any manor
woman ?

Like many other questions that
trouble us in this world, wherein
nothing seems quite right and nothing
altogether wrong, we are constrained
to leave it for the history of future
ages, that we shall never see, to
answer.

Knowing only what we know, we
must not say 'eyes" we cannot say
no." We have not sufficient light for
any such generalities.

But when one finds this unique
treasure of human life, to whom it is.

with respect to his tangible earthly
possessions, what the pearl of great
price was to the merchantman of Scripture,
there seems no better thing for
him to do than to sell all that he has
to buy it, so long as he sells only what
is absolutely his own, and none of the
rights and privileges that belong to
other people.
