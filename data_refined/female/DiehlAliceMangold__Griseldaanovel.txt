CHAPTER I.

EW would ever forget that eventful
night at Crowsfoot Station,
after the terrible news had
been telegraphed that the 6.20 train from
London was run into by an express, and
was smashed, telescope, crushed.

The crowd of villagers  parents, children,
or wives, and their relatives  who
had beloved ones in the doomed train,
still wailed and cried, a surging ungoverned.

III. A

able crowd upon the platform. Doctor
Mayne and the station-master tried in vain
to calm and to disperse them.

Hugh Blunt  who had sickened to
faintness at the sight of his love Griselda
coming in to learn that not only her
beloved father, but Hal Romayne, whom
she so dearly loved, was a passenger in
the wrecked train  speedily recovered.
For Griselda glided through the crowd
like a ghost, and laid her hand upon his
arm.

Tell me, please,' she said.

She was perfectly composed. Hugh
marvelled  wondered.

Mr Black  may not  perhaps  most
likely, has not come by this  we don't
know  I should think not,' he faltered
and stammered out.

Papa was coming by this train. whatever

has happened, he is there. Now,
what is to be done ? '

Those great eyes looked searchingly
into his out of that beautiful face  oh, so
deadly pale !

How can we get to him ? '

'We cannot! It is forty miles down
the line!' cried Hugh.

Forty miles ! Cannot we catch a down
train to Cowbrook Junction, and get a
special . '

By that time he might be here  then
the traffic is suspended  then'  Hugh
drew a deep breath before he could stab
his darling to the heart. 'Griselda,' he said,
miserably, and for once the tears ran plentifully
from his eyes, 'dear Sir Hubert is
in there  the waiting-room  struck down,
poor father  he came to meet his son.'

Griselda was only a girl. She swerved ;

then Hugh caught her. She had fainted.
But her strong will overcame impressions.
In a few moments she struggled up.

'I know  I understand,' she said
pantlngly. ' There is the doctor. We
must not think of ourselves. Doctor
Mayne  Sir Hubert  poor Sir Hubert!
Let me help  '

She knows all,' said Hugh.

It will do her good to help,' said the
little doctor. ' Now, Griselda, my dear,
you will very likely have to be nurse for
some time to come ; so, before you really
perform  before the wounded and those
to help them arrive  you may have a
little practice. Sir Hubert is in there.
Come along ! '

Action is everything, ' he thought,
In such a crisis, in such suspense, to
pause to think means madness.'

He supported Griselda into the .
There, on an improvised
couch of a mattress and blankets, hastily
furnished by the station-master, lay Sir
Hubert Romayne.

The old man looked grander in the
semblance of death   stretched out stiff
and straight, his hands lying limply at
his sides, his regular features sunken,
livid, his grey hair wet with the cooling
lotion the station-master's wife, kneeling
at his side, was gently dabbing on his
pale brow  than in ruddy life, when he
had a half-shy, half-proud, and somewhat
undignified presence, born of his subservience
to his imperious wife.

Miss Black will take your place, Mrs
Wright. We shall want you and your
house directly,' said Doctor Mayne, ina
low tone. So Mrs Wright gave her

place to Griselda. Doctor Mayne gave
her his directions in the common-place
business-like way in which surgeons face
their awful responsibilities and fight
death ; and Hal Romayne's beloved was
alone with Hal Romayne's father in his
dire need and sore danger.

What a strange scene  the waiting-room,
with its drawn Venetian blinds,
heavy table, and coarse leather-covered
chairs on the cocoa-nut matting ! Sir
Hugh lay opposite the fireplace. Gris-ella's
eyes would rest upon a gaudy advertisement
of some provincial hotel.
There was the palatial building, with a
grand garden and a planted carriage-road,
with ladies on horseback careering
and prancing, and barouches and victorias
coming and going, and underneath
was the printed sentence,  ' The

Universal Hotel Company, Limited.
Capital, 500,000.'

How small, poor, and pitiful the pictured
scheme looked here now, In that
silent room, with one dim candle burning,
and that awful hum  wail, mingled
with the tread of many feet upon the
gravel outside !

In the midst of life we are in death
The well-known words were truths today,
she felt, as she watched the seemingly
dying man. A stupor, a mental drowsiness
was coming to numb her emotions  God's
merciful help to those In such straits.

Then she heard a shout, a roar, going
up from the crowd outside.

A pilot engine !

Outside, under the stars, the stationmaster
had called aside Hugh, Doctor
Mayne, and the curate, all of whom were

in the Romayne circle, and, as be was
doing their best to soothe and tranquillize
the relatives whose beloved ones were in
the wrecked train. He took them to the
end of the platform where late autumn
roses gleamed white in the darkness
against the low brick wall, and said, 

We shall know the worst directly. A
pilot is on the way.' At that moment, ' ting-ting
' went the electric bell. * There ! ' said
Mr Wright significantly, hurrying off. ' In
three minutes at the utmost.'

If Hugh had been forewarned of those
three minutes, he would have anticipated
exquisite mental torture.

As it was, no sooner had he heard that
the crucial moment was at hand than he
became calm, cool. His emotions were
petrified, his active power was keenly
alive, his will was a rock.

He did not know how, or why, or when
this happened. He only knew it was so,
and said, ' Thank God ! '

The others  Doctor Mayne and Mr
Vivian, the curate  seemed equally prepared
with himself.

During that three minutes they talked
commonplaces.

Everything is ready upstairs,' said the
doctor. ' Mrs Mayne came  I sent her
back for stores  she is here  with the
maid. I sent off a very good old widow,
Mrs Hood, to prepare Jemima for contingencies.
Ah, there are my colleagues ! '

He went off to meet three local doctors.

Has anyone sent for Lady Romayne
sent to Feather's Court .- '

It was the first thing I did,' lisped
Mr Vivian.

He was a younger son of people

not ' eccentrically philanthropic' His first
thought had been for Lady Romayne,
who had been an active agent in introducing
him to Crowsfoot, and Crowsfoot
to him.

The son of the miller with whom the
Reverend Mr Vivian lodged went off on
his father's heavy cob with a hastily-written
note, intended to prepare Lady Romayne
for the impending shock. When that
sullen, desperate roar went up from the
agonised crowd on the platform as the
pilot engine came dashing along the line,
and drew up at the station, Hal's mother
was on her way to learn the worst.

It has come ! ' muttered Hugh, involuntarily
clenching his fists in his effort
to prepare himself for the blow.

As the engine stopped, the two blackened
men  driver and stoker  were

rushed at by the white-faced, eager
crowd. Men and boys tried to clamber
upon the engine, to swarm upon it.
The engine-driver had borne this scene
whenever he had stopped.

Back  hold back, can't yer ? ' he
cried roughly. Then he made a sign
to the station-master, whom he knew.
Mr Wright struggled bravely to reach
him, but failed. The curate tried to
expostulate. Good people, pray be calm,'
he mildly said. But his voice was asa
whisper in a roaring whirlwind. Suddenly
Hugh skirted the crowd, and
sprang upon the engine.

Drive on a bit ! ' he cried.

The driver obeyed. The pilot was offa
hundred yards before anyone actually
knew that she was gone.

Now ! ' said Hugh fiercely.

Never saw such a sight, sir, and I've
been in many accidents. Train regular
smashed and minced into splinters no
bigger than this here little finger-nail o'
mine. Dead '. I'd rather be one of them
corpses than them poor unfortunate as have
got to lie in such mortal agonies as I
never see. It's enough to sicken a feller
for railways for his life. Fault ? Nobody's
fault, as far as I knows. Did I
recognise anyone ? Yes, I did  two  a
pal o' mine  a nephew of my wife's, who
was a-lying on the embankment lookin'
for all the world as if he was asleep and
a-dreamin' like my little 'un at home in his
bassinet ; he was stone dead, he was. I
recognised him, but only one other. Rest
seemed to me to be muddled up like, just
like a heap of Punches and Judas. No,
they didn't move, and there weren't much

noise. Did you recognise anyone, Bill ? '
to the stoker. ' No ? Well, he's fresh
on the line, sir. The other? It's a poor
tale to tell ; but t'other was the wally,
as they call 'em, to the young gentleman
at Feather's Court. He won't dead. He
wor in a second-class, front of the train.
He knew me, he did. He sent after me.
I come to him. " I'm a-doing," he ses.
I didn't say " nay." He wos a-dyin', if
ever a man wos. I ses, '' You hasn't got
no call to bother about anything as you
leave behind, old man ? " He ses, '' No " 
at least if you can call it a saying' ; for I see
his lips move, and didn't hear. I stoops
close, and he ses, " My young master 
and Mr Black. Take care of the luggage 
take care of the luggage*' Then he gave
a gasp like a fish wriggling on the grass,
and he was gone too. Them were his

last words, *' Take care of the luggage."
'

And  and  the gentlemen ? ' panted
Hugh.

Lor' bless you, sir ! They was in at
the back ; I giv' one look. That was
enough for me ! ' He turned aside, and
spat significantly. ' There's no call to tell
yer what I see. But it ain't no manner
of use bolstering up the truth. There
ain't a man at the rear of that train as'll
live to tell the tale, and that's about it.'

One instant's horrible silence  a transfiguration
of misery to Hugh ; then he
turned, wan and ghastly, and motioned
the driver to return to the platform.

The terrible tale was soon told. The
agitation gave way to a panic-stricken
hush. Some of the widows and orphans
were supported from the scene. These

were not a few, for the 6.20 train from
London picked up bricklayers, labourers,
and others all along the line who lived
at Crowsfoot, tempted there by the
advantages enjoyed by the Crowsfoot
people under John Black's ministration.


The curate and Doctor Mayne, aided
by practitioners from neighbouring villages,
and those clergymen who had heard the
bad news, did what they could. But little
Doctor Mayne's stern self-possession was
nearly upset when Mr Wright, the stationmaster,
said to him in a bitter sort of way,  -

Ah, it's all no go, sir ! They mean
well ; but we want him!

At the ' him ' he choked, and hurried
away. The Vicar, John Black  the one
who had moulded and led these people
for so many years, who knew their lives

almost as well as he knew his own  was
dead, or dying !

Hugh's one thought was  Griselda.
He must tell her, he must tell her, he
feverishly repeated to himself. Oh, would
his merciful God give him the strength to
crush that dear heart in the least cruel
way ? Trust the task to another ? Not
he! If It killed her  he must soften the
torture  he would be able to soften the
torture, he loved her so. But he must
have one moment alone, silent.

He made his way through the station,
and, crossing the yard, leaned up against
the paling of a copse known for Its
nightingales. It was now silent as
death. The nightingales had fled south ;
but he was glad. Their song just then
would have jarred upon him.

He drew a long breath, lifted his hat,

and let the cool niorht-wind blow about
his hair. He looked up at the shining
stars, each one a great world, a link in
the eternal chain of a blessed Eternity.
The thought of how short, how fleeting,
though how important was this life, with
its grinding cares, bitter disappointments,
sudden joys, and terrible catastrophes,
steadied him. Hugh was not religious,
according to the orthodox meaning of
the term. But he was deeply thinking,
and he knew that man's soul, with its
possibilities, could not be only for days,
weeks, months, or even years,  for, indeed,
any limited existence.

I must do it.'

He faced his duty. He turned to go
and perform it, when two red sparks
danced in the dark road to his left,
where he could just see the tall black

VOL. III. B

trees, blacker than their dusky background
; thin wheels grated on the
gravel, and a vehicle came dashing into
the station-yard.

The light dog-cart from Feather's
Court  Lady Romayne ! He hurried
forward. As the cart drew up, the
station door opened, a flood of light fell
upon the unfortunate mother. She was
white, panting  all dignity gone  she
almost fell out of the dog cart into
Hugh's arms.

My boy, my boy ! Where is he ? '
she gasped, clinging to Hugh. ' Oh, Mr
Blunt, have pity ! Take me to him ! '

Hush ! You must hope, we must
hope,' said Hugh vaguely. 'Oh, Doctor
Mayne'  with relief, as the doctor came
hurrying out,  ' here is Lady Romayne
! '

Ah, that's right ! ' said the doctor
cheeringly. * Now, my dear madam, we
must not exaggerate, we must bear up.
Come into Mrs Wright's room. Take
my arm.' Then, supporting the trembling
woman, he whispered, * Tell Gris-ella
all ; she will break it to her the
best. Bring her to Mrs Wright's room
at once.'

While Mrs Wright attended to Lady
Romayne and Doctor Mayne gave hera
composing draught, Hugh went to
Griselda.

She was still sitting there, waiting,
bathing Sir Hubert's forehead. She had
heard the bustle and the cries and the
sad hush outside. No one had come
to tell her what news had arrived. But
her life had taught her to wait.

She raised her eyes as Hugh came

in, and read all there was to read in his
grief-stricken face.

She rose  gestured to him to stay,
and stepped softly to him.

Both ? ' she asked.

We  cannot  hear. Perhaps 
neither.'

God will help us ! ' said the stricken
girl. And her eyes seemed lighted by
a supernatural ray as she looked upward.
Life  this life seemed to her
over  past, gone. They had begun another.
She and all those suddenly
bereaved had begun to follow.

Lady Romayne is here. Will you
tell her?'

'When I know what there is to tell.'
Hugh briefly narrated the arrival of
the pilot-engine and the driver's story.
*We might have hoped but for that

valet's last words,' he added. 'It is
certain they were in the train.'

Take me,' said Griselda, putting her
hand on Hugh's arm. He led her
through the stragglers waiting about
the station in vague expectation of they
knew not what, out upon the platform.
Here the station-master came up, a new
excitement barely veiled by his self-controlled
manner.

A special is signalled  Cowbrook
Junction.'

i\ny directions ? '

We don't know what she is yet. But
she may be bringing  some  home.'

You must prepare, Lady Romayne,
and be prepared yourself, for anything,'
said Hugh to Griselda desperately.
Then the door of the station-master's
sitting-room closed upon her.

How incongruous ! Lady Romayne,
in her fine silk dinner-dress, jewels on
throat and arms, and glittering rings in
her ears and on her fingers, lay back
in Mrs Wright's basket-chair by the
fire, sobbing, her handkerchief to her
eyes. Mrs Mayne kneeling by her,
Doctor Mayne standing on the hearth-rug,
vainly trying to soothe her before
taking her to her husband.

You know we cannot have this sort of
thing near Sir Hubert,' he said to Griselda,
as she came up to him. He spoke impatiently.
He thought Lady Romayne's
lack of self-control unpardonable selfishness.

Lady Romayne, suddenly looking up,
saw Griselda.

Ms he  is there news . ' she almost
shrieked. The girl's composure made
her hope. * Oh, tell me ! '

She clutched at Griselda's hands.
And Griselda only felt that this washer
beloved, lost Hal's mother. The
sight reanimated her, as the sight of her
fatherless children will sometime reanimate
a new-made widow.

Leave us, ' she said. Then she
knelt down by Lady Romayne, and,
caressing her hands, looked into her
swollen eyes with love and hope. She
talked in a firm, yet tender way, as to
an unreasonably frightened child. She
admitted that the accounts of the accident
were alarming. But they must
allow for exaggeration. ' My father
seems to have been with him,' she
said ; ' and he always travels in the
middle of the train. The 6.20 is a long
train, too.' She would not even admit
that, if not killed, their travellers must

be wounded. But Lady Romayne was
unreasonable. One minute she was
dissolved in tears, the next she sprang
up, wringing her hands, wailing out that
she could not bear it, she could not bear it.

'What should I do without Hal?'
was her cry.

You can do anything  we can bear
anything ! ' said Griselda. * Oh, Lady
Romayne, I have loved Hal ever since
I was a tiny child, and my one  great
pleasure was to see him  anywhere,
anyhow, even if he did not see me.
But I had to learn to do without him.
It seemed very hard. But, after I had
borne it a day, it seemed easier to bear
it a week, and, after I had borne it a
month, I knew I could bear it a year,
and even a lifetime ; and, if necessary,
you will feel this  '

Oh no, no, never ! ' cried the unhappy
woman, in a fresh agony. ' I
am not Hke you. After living with your
father in that poor, wretched way, you
might put up with anything. But I
have always had everything I wanted.
Oh, it is too hard  too cruel ! '

Hush ! ' said Griselda suddenly.

There was a rush of many feet, the
murmur of voices, then a shrill whistle,
and the hoarse panting of an engine.

The mother started up with a shriek.
She and Griselda were alone.

Why, it is a train ! They have come ! '
Someone looked in, banged the door,

and locked it on the outside.

They have locked us in ! ' Lady
Romayne flew to the door, shook it,
beat against it, screamed, ' Let me outlet
me out ! ' She was fairly maddened

by this, which she thought meant the
worst ; then she rushed to the window,
threw it open, and leant out.

Hastily-improvised torches were flaring,
the fitful light flickering upon the ghastly
sight of covered, still forms being lifted
from the compartments of a special train
of a few carriages. Griselda watched
with silent horror over her shoulder.

Lady Romayne was speechless now ;
and, when someone beckoned Doctor
Mayne and the station-master, and the
three together lifted a body out of a
first-class carriage covered with Hal's
travelling coat, she gave a low moan,
tottered back, and fell in a heap upon
the floor.

Griselda could not help her. Sick and
faint, she leant back against the windowsill.
The voices and sounds seemed to

recede, the lights to grow dim and ta
disappear, like lamps in a dense fog.

How long they remained thus she could
not have told. She felt chill. She afterwards
remembered noticing the scent of
some late mignonette in a flower-box on
the window-sill, and seeing Mrs Wright's
tabby cat jump up on a chair and rub
against her. That was all.

Then the door was roughly unlocked
and forms came flocking in ; and a voice
cried ' Mother ! ' and there was talking and
tramping about ; and she knew no more till
she felt warm drops tumbling on her face
and her hands being kissed by rough kisses ;
and she awoke to find her head resting on
her father's knee, and he, well, strong, bending
over his exhausted but happy child.

Then her tired eyes saw another face.
And Griselda felt  as if she were in heaven.

HE railway accident and those
horrible hours of suspense
were things of the past.
Their effects were being dealt with.
Crowsfoot and its inhabitants were busy.
The Vicars story of his and Hal's
escape was a strange one. The two
were locked into a first-class compartment,
and the doomed train was on
the point of starting, when the Vicar
suddenly found that he had left his
pocket-book containing the bundle of
letters given him by the lawyers when

they disclosed his true story to him at
Hal's chambers. To open the door with
his own railway - key was an instant's
work. Hal, startled, sprang out after
him. They had barely time to see
Chancelll  the unfortunate valet who
was to die in an hour or two  and shout
to him to wait at the station or proceed
to Feather's Court with the luggage,
and say they would arrive by a
later train  before the ill-fated 6.20
moved off and had started on her
death-journey.

They returned to Pall Mall, found the
pocket-book, and, after chatting over a
cup of coffee, strolled back to the station
to start by the 8.15 train.

The first shock was when Hal showed
the tickets at the barrier, and the man
informed him that ' there wouldn't be

no more trains on that there line that
night. The Hne was blocked.'

Bit by bit  for the officials were
reticent  they learned the dreadful truth.
Then both, agitated, thought of Griselda.
To do Hal justice, his second thought
was for his father. The Idea of the
mother, who had first spoiled and then
thwarted him, never once troubled him.

They went to the telegraph office.
Telegraphic communication was Interrupted.


What Is to be done ? ' said the Vicar,
in despair. It was not only his darling's
anxiety and suspense that wrung his
heart  It was the thought of so many
of his flock he Intimately knew in
pain. In danger  agony of body and
mind  and he not there to help.

We must have a special,' said Hal,

i

hurrying him off to the chief office of
the London terminus.

They were civilly received. But at
the idea of a private special the heads
of the official department looked doubtful.


You see we have no precedent,
gentlemen.'

Hal, in his passionate turmoil, strode
about the office and offered doubles
 the usual fee. But 

Money is no object at this juncture,'
gravely said the treasurer. ' Still, if you
will wait a minute, I will see what can
be done.'

He disappeared behind the scenes,
and presently came back to say that, if
they chose to be volunteers for the
special train which was on the point of
starting for the scene of the catastrophe

with doctors, nurses, and ambulance
necessities, he would smuggle them in.

They acquiesced with grateful alacrity,
and Hal insisted on leaving his name to
head any number of subscriptions which
might follow the disaster. Then they
started with the relieving contingent. They
gave active help to the few maimed survivors
at the Junction, the sickening scene
of the smash ; then they proceeded,
with the injured and the dead, along
the line to Crowsfoot. The body
covered with Hal's travelling - coat 
which Lady Romayne saw through the
window of the station-master's parlour
was that of poor Chancelll, Hal's faithful
valet.

The general bereavement brought
people to a level. No distinction was
made. While Sir Hugh lay in his

grand bed-chamber, gradually rallying-from
what proved to be a mild paralytic
seizure, poor labourers who had not
been too dangerously wounded to betaken
to Feather's Court occupied the
soft satin-hung beds in the guest chambers.
There was a staff of nurses,,
among whom Hal's younger sister, the
bright, fair-haired Mabel, and Griselda,.
were juniors,  and took orders from the
experienced as meekly as if they had
been two under-housemaids in the great
mansion. Lady Romayne, who was still
in a low nervous state, with occasional
bursts of hysterical tears, hovered about
and humbly offered her services. That
cruel night had changed the proud self-assertion
lady into a timid trembling
woman.

The chartering of the Court as a
VOL. in. c

hospital was Hal's doing. The scene 
when he was surrounded by the maimed,
the dead, and the dying, and knew that
but for some almost miraculous accident
that simple incident of the Vicar's
forgetfulness of his pocket-book  he
would have made one of the ghastly
crowd, was before him wherever he
went. He was haunted by the words,
One shall be taken, and the other left.'
He had never been so impressed  so
awe-stricken.

I cannot understand it,' he said, when
he brought himself to tell the Vicar of
his feelings. ' Here is my brother, a
steady-going serious fellow, who carries
off prizes by the half-dozen, and tells
the girls a parson's life is a sort of
heaven on earth which he longs to
enter, he would make a far better head

of the family than I ever can ! There
is a warp in me  I cannot settle down.
With one exception, I am changeable
as the wind. I like a thing to-day
which is hateful to me tomorrow ; I
hunt eagerly and closely for some fancy
which possesses me, like a child hunts
a butterfly ; but the moment I know I
may seize it, I turn aside, disgusted.
Yet I am left left. What for . I can
never do any good. I am doomed to
be a curse.'

The Vicar took Hal's talk at his own
valuation, and, if he did not exactly
preach, spoke sensibly of life and its
peculiarities.'

I know more about you than you do
yourself, my boy,' he said. ' I know
your grave faults and your noble
qualities. You, as it were, hold your

future in your own hands. You are the
scales to weigh the good and the bad
as they are to be  in your own Hfe
to come.'

The Vicar went from the stationmaster's,
where the hopeless cases were
elinor out their last breaths, to Doctor
Mayne's, where the complicated surgical
cases were domiciled, and from thereto
the Feather's Court hospital daily
sometimes twice. Yet no word of his
changed circumstances, his parentage,
his new name, had escaped him, even
to Griselda.

All personal matters, even in those
most wrapt up in self, seemed merged
in the general catastrophe. During these
days Hal, Griselda, Mabel, Hugh Blunt
were little else but comrades. Hush
Blunt had mentally resigned Griselda,

and, from his experience of the Romaynes
at this crisis, was inclined to
have less fear for her future. The
brother of that open-hearted generous
Mabel could not be actually a bad
fellow.

Lydia, Hal's elder and languid sister,
was in Scotland, staying with some
noble friends who rented a deer-forest.
Hal's brother was at school, and Gris-ella's
brothers, Tom and Harry, were
also away. Those four  Hal, Griselda,
Hugh, and Mabel, with Mervyn Bray
as an amiable but diffident fifth  shared
the burden of the sick men, talked
over the cases as their one joint interest
in life, hoped against hope, and
were cast down and had to be comforted
when one of the flickering life-flames
they were watching went out.

A week after the accident the dead
were buried in Crowsfoot churchyard.
Mr Vivian read the beautiful Burial
Service, amid the sobs of the mourners
who thronged the green peaceful little
spot.

Griselda and Mabel Romayne, escorted
by Hal, Hugh Blunt, and Mervyn Bray,
went amongst the mourners, trying to
comfort them. Griselda, Mabel, Hugh,
and Mervyn Bray were sufficiently composed
; but Hal, when he passed Mrs
Black's grave, and remembered the day
when he, as a young boy, stood there
and vowed fidelity to the quaint self-helpful
little motherless child, was overcome.


When the touching service was over,
he pleaded to Griselda to wait for him.
So Griselda stood bravely at the churchyard

gate, watching the mourners depart,
and then asked Mabel, as a favour,
to proceed to the vicarage, where she
was to have tea, and to wait for her.
And Hugh, in respect to her wishes,
offered his arm to the bright gentle girl,
telling Bray to follow. Griselda fancied
she would find Hal at her mother's
grave, and she was not wrong. He had
thrown himself upon the grass a few
yards away. It was a soft, sunny
autumn day. A robin was singing,
perched on a twig of the hedge close
by. The dead leaves lay among the
graves. It was not a day for happy
hopes or bright thoughts  rather for
humble faith and staunch, good resolves.

Hal rose as he saw her coming.

'Do you remember?' he asked, leading
her gently to the spot where, years

ago, they stood together. ' What would
she have thought of a calamity like
this? It would have broken her heart!'

'Oh no ! ' said Griselda, with sudden
fervour. ' She would have seen it in
the right light. She used to tell me,
when the death-bell tolled, that the gardener
of heaven had seen a plant here
fit to bloom above, and had transplanted
it. She said that none ever went who
were not fit to go.'

'No, that is just it,' said Hal. 'Oh,
Griselda, since that awful night I have
felt so bad  so worthless  yet I am no
worse than I was.' Then he went on,
pleading for himself, begging, entreating
her that their lives should be joined,
that he might grow pure and self-sacrificing
by and through her.

You know,' she softly said, ' that I

am willing. But your mother must
wish such a thing  ay, and tell my
father so  before there can be any real
talk of my being your wife.'

But, this granted, you would take
me, Griselda ? ' he asked, with more
spirit. 'You  beautiful, good  would
take what Death and the devil seem
to despise ? '

That is not like you,' said Griselda,
devotion  love  fervour in her great
violet eyes. ' But, Hal, you don't thrive
out of the sunshine! Oh, I thought
that long ago ; and I used to think
that perhaps my having been accustomed
to see trouble and anxiety and
worry of all sorts would make up in a
way for my want of beauty and family
and riches  for I could plan out my
life to stand between you and unpleasant

things. But what am I talking
about ? ' she cried, with a blush of
confusion.

You are talking like my beloved
wife, Griselda,' said Hal, placing her
hand on his arm. Then, silent, but
with a new sense of happiness, they
walked down the churchyard-path and
through the loch-gate together.

After that brief talk of they two
being made one, Hal said no more for
many days. He had determined that
the next conversation on the subject
of his marriage with Griselda should
be very different.

O Griselda became the wife of
one of the ' great matches ' of
the county. The first time
that Sir Hubert and My Lady called
at the vicarage to ask for Griselda as
their son's wife, they were met, much
to Lady Romayne's surprise, with a curt
refusal. Then came a stormy scene with
Hal. He rushed off to Crowsfoot, to find
Griselda and her father happy in their
new hopes, and no longer obdurate.

At Crowsfoot the Vicar and his
daughter were beloved ; so that the

opinion of the country round was that
Hal Romayne was not good enough
for that pure, beautiful young girl, who
seemed to live in an atmosphere of contented
peace, which she carried whither
she went.

Griselda's presence had seemed to
many like oil on the troubled waters
of their daily lives ; and, while feeling
that they would sorely miss her unconsciously
cheering and elevating influence,
the notion of ' fast Hal Romayne ' asher
husband was a slight shock.

Meanwhile, the idea of ' that good-looking
young Romayne, who might
have married anybody almost, going
and marrying a nobody  a governess !
No, well, some curate's daughter,' as
society put it, gave quite another sort
of shock to the titled dowagers and

eligible daughters, who amused themselves,
especially those who were likely
to be guests of Sir Hubert and Lady
Romayne, in planning how to bring the
interloper, Griselda, to discomfiture when
only they had the chance.

Of course Hal had carried his point.
His father and mother came to the
vicarage a second time, and asked
almost humbly for Griselda's hand.
This time the Vicar did not allow himself
the grim amusement of refusing her
ladyship, but was as amiable as if he
had forgotten all the wrongs and slights
endured by the orphan  the waif, John
Black, and had been the acknowledged
son of the great Professor Blackett and
in possession of a comfortable income
all his life.

Of course, one's knowing who he is,

and being the son of a celebrated man,
ready and able to settle a decent sum
upon his daughter, and all that, makes
a considerable difference,' Lady Romayne
acknowledged to her son, while trying
to ' look at the best side of things
And the man really seems more civilised
now that he knows who he is. It
must be very uncomfortable indeed not
to know who you are. Then, you see,
I will say Griselda managed that sensibly
 he is all right with his bishop.
The affair is not the same in any way.
Only one thing I must insist upon. We
must introduce the marriage to society
in a clerical light.'

It was of no use for Hal impatiently
to anathematise * society,' and to say he
wanted no society but Griselda's, and
chosen friends, who talked sense, et

caetera. Lady Romayne shook her head,
and said that, as she had yielded so
much, it would be unjust if she were
not allowed to arrange the wedding.

Hal, finding Griselda anxious to please
his mother in any way, acquiesced, but
with an ill grace.

They were married on Christmas Eve,
Griselda's birthday. Only a few were
at the church. The weather fell in with
Lady Romayne's plans. Snow lay on
the ground. The steeple caught a few
flakes, which fell rustling upon the ivy-clad
church wall as the bishop, who
had offered to marry Griselda, read the
Marriage Service in his well-pitched
sonorous voice.

Within, it was, as Lady Romayne
whispered to the bishop's wife, *an ideal
wedding.' The sun shone through the

great window, illumining the wreaths of
holly mingled with white flowers that
hung above the Communion-table and
just tenderly touching the bishop's
silvery hair before it fell upon the slim
figure of Griselda in her simple white
gown, with lilies upon her breast,  and
upon her light veil, which fell back.

It certainly is pretty,' whispered back
the bishop's wife. ' She looks so saintly
in that halo of sunshine. Like that
picture  the Christian Martyr  a girl
floating in the water, you know.'

Lady Romayne thought the word
martyr ' singularly inapplicable ; but she
only smiled sympathetically, for she
greatly counted upon this worthy lady's
help to launch Griselda upon ' society '
in a strong clerical light.

There was Dean Trevor, a dapper

priest, whose chapel in Belgravia was
thronged whenever he preached, assisting
the bishop and a neighbouring rector
to marry Griselda. The dean's sister
and the neighbouring rector's daughter
were two of the four bridesmaids  the
remaining two being Hal's sisters, Lydia
and Mabel. The four were in white
cashmere, trimmed with swansdown. But
it was the clergy and their wives that
Lady Romayne relied upon. She felt
that the John Blackett who stood there,
a noble figure, had never looked so well
as when he placed Griselda's hand in
Hal's giving her away to her handsome
son. Lady Romayne shed just one tear
about Hal, who, with his handsome
face, somewhat pale, his lips compressed,
stood there in his splendid uniform 
being sacrificed,' as his mother thought.

VOL. III. D

The little congregation felt somehow
that this bridegroom and bride were
much in earnest. This was a marriage
rather than a wedding ; Griselda was
very serious. She dimly felt that there
were far more dangerous rocks ahead
than she had encountered in her maiden
life, hard though this had been.

And Hal ? Why was he to all
appearance more impressed than he had
been perhaps ever before ?

He had never loved Griselda better
than when she came to him at the altar,
leaning on her tall father's arm, followed
by her bridesmaids. He had given her
an elated, passionate glance as they
were marshalled before the bishop by
the old clerk, who had been interested
in the babe so strangely born in the
snow, and had little dreamt that the

old-fashioned, demure little child who
used to toddle so quaintly into church
and climb into her place in the vicarage
pew would ever be made a great lady
of thus.

Yes, Hal had never felt more tender,
more loving, than now. But, in the
middle of the service a sudden thought
or was it an indescribable sensation ?
chilled, startled him.

It was as if some other than himself
had repeated that solemn oath after the
good bishop  as if some mocking, derisive
voice had uttered the words  * to
have and to hold, for better for worse,
for richer for poorer, in sickness and
in health, to love and to cherish, till
death us do part.'

Death  till death!

Nevermore the old freedom  

OF Million

more the acting upon impulses as they
arose  always another self to think of 
and although that self was Griselda 

Good heavens ! I never realised it ! '
he thought. Little wonder that he was
so distrait, as he led Griselda into the
vestry, that, when he was called upon to
sign the register, he stood, bewildered,
pen in hand  wondering what this meant.

Griselda, receiving her congratulations,
and trying not to hear Lady Romayne's
asides  ' Such a sweet, good child ! Weare
so thankful Hal will have such a
wife,' et caetera  saw a look on Hal's
face she had never seen before.

To her the marriage service had simply
meant blessing upon and grace to fulfil
all her resolutions, since she knew she
was to marry the man she loved. Her
experience of life had taught her to expect

but little joy, and that  marred. She
watched Hal anxiously. She was anxious
for him. Then she caught Hugh
Blunt's eyes gazing on her with an indescribable
expression.

She did not stop to wonder what Hugh's
expression meant. She went to him.

Could you hasten our carriage, do you
think .' she said pleadingly. 'I shall be
glad to get away, you know, and my
husband too.'

Your carriage shall be here in half
a minute,' said Hugh, seizing his hat
and going out, as he went through the
church thinking ' Good heavens ! what a
beginning ! '

He had watched Hal's emotion, and
had  such keenness of perception seemed
to have formed out of his great love for
Griselda  had almost read his thoughts.

Let us go, Hal said Griselda to her
pale young husband, who looked bewildered.
' The carriage is there. I shall
be so glad to be out of the bustle, you
know.'

Here Hugh Blunt returned, announced
that the bride and bridegroom's carriage
waited, then gave a hint aside to Hal to
offer his arm to his wife.

Many brides would have been overwhelmed
by such a bridegroom. But
Griselda took his arm smilingly, went
down the aisle with happy glances right
and left, nodded to the village folk hurrahing
outside, and bowed and smiled till
the carriage was fairly out of Crowsfoot
parish.

Then she threw up her veil and took
her husband's hand.

Darling,' she said, ' I see what it is 

you did not count the cost ! You have
been more generous than just in your
love for me ! But do not think I will bea
burden to you. It will not be ordinary
husband and wife with us ! Do you think
I shall interfere with you ? I am yours.
I will obey you  to the death  unless
conscience forbids me.'

She looked so lovely, so faithful ! Hal
took her in his arms, and kissed her
passionately  he hardly knew his own
feelings. They seemed all bitter remorse
and wild love  yet those meaning words
' till death '  rang in his ears.

Griselda,' he said, almost fiercely, ' you
are too good for me, and I know it now
 too late, too late ! 1 never realised ;
here I have vowed myself till death 
death  how am I to keep myself at that
that pitch of perfection ? Why, I

should have laughed at my giving my
word to Heaven like that to scorn, till
I  till I  knew we were to be man and
wife ! ' he went on, with a crimson blush.
Yet I have sworn, and I feel wretched,
for I seem to be at your mercy, and how
can I change so utterly. Who  who 
will help me ? '

I will,' said Griselda, with a lovely
glance of her sweet eyes. ' Hal  my
husband ; ' she nestled close to her strange
bridegroom as if he had been the least
selfish and most chivalrous being  ' don't
fear! If you will come tome, I will do
anything, anything  that is right.'

Hal kissed her forehead.

Oh, if only you were not so pure, so
good, that it seems a sacrilege, almost,
to take you into the world ! ' he said. ' I
fancy it is my feeling about your unworldliness

which overwhelms me he went on.
Still, you can go into the world, through
the world, and remain unspotted, my
adored,' he said, raising the corner of her
veil and kissing it. ' My love,' somehow
he could not bring himself to say ' my
wife, I am glad we chose Paris for our
honeymoon. I fancy Parisian life may
bring our tastes more together.'

Then he described the life of visitors
to the continental capital, till they drove
into the park of Feather's Court, under
the triumphal evergreen arch, and through
the snowy slopes where tenants and
villagers cheered and waved handkerchiefs
; then there was no more serious
talk. For there were the Feather's Court
lacqueys in new gay liveries and glistening
silk stockings, opening the great door of
the white mansion, and maids, with

favours in their pretty high caps, peeping
from among the banks of plants in the
hall. Feather's Court looked its best today,
the white stone terraces decorated
with evergreens in green pots  flags
waving from Venetian masts erected on
the slopes in the park. The turf was
all green and white patches  the snow
quickly melting under the bright winter
morning sun.

Griselda smiled and nodded to the
assembled servants, as she blushingly
ascended the wide staircase leading to
the drawing-rooms, on her husband's
arm.

It seems so unreal,' she said to him
Just like when you stepped down into-the
orchard in your green velvet suit all
those years ago.'

She looked with a certain awe at the

magnificent staircase hung with great
pictures  old sea-fights, solemn-looking
portraits of men in armour, and grandly-dressed
women with long taper fingers
and slim waists. How would she ever
live here and be a great lady ?

This item in her marriage-bond had
not occurred to her.

Hal thought she looked lovely, and
felt pacified as they entered the drawing-room,
where there were huge fires, and
the warm atmosphere was impregnated
with the odours of stephanotis and other
white waxen hot-house blooms in the vases.

Come, and let us have a look at you,
before all these nuisances arrive,' he said,
drawing her before one of the long mirrors,
Bother ! If there are not two carriages 
the bridesmaids and the men, of course, racing
along the drive  do you see ? It would

serve them right if the horses went down.
Look, Griselda ! ' he went on, his arm
around her, as they stood before the glass.
Griselda glanced timidly at the reflection
of her handsome husband. She seemed to
herself to look absolutely insignificant by
his side.

I don't like you so well in your uniform,
Hal,' she said. ' I liked your grey
suit ; I remember how I used to put my
cheek against your arm.'

She sighed. He took her in his arms
and kissed her, and had hardly settled the
folds of her veil before the bridesmaids
came in, followed by Hugh Blunt and
Mervyn Bray ; a staid major  the only
military friend Hal chose to invite to the
clerical wedding  and  the young Dean
Trevor, who was enchanted with the bride.

Upon my word, you are to be congratulated,

my boy,' he said to Hal, while
the bridesmaids bravely smothered those
little jealousies bridesmaids will feel, and
hovered prettily about the bride ; ' there is
something so Una-like about Mrs Romayne.
Don't start '  he laid his hand
on Hal's arm. ' I suppose I am lucky
enough to be the first to call the bride by
her married name ? Yes ! Do you know
that, while assisting our good bishop, I
could not help feeling as if this were the
profession of a nun, rather than the joining
of a man and woman in the bonds of matrimony
? If I am not utterly wrong, there
is something peculiarly saintly about Mrs
Romayne, Hal. By the way, the bishop
and Lady Romayne wish me to propose
your healths  the bishop hates speeches.
And you know, though I am not old, so to
say '  he ran his fingers through his prematurely

grey hair with a satisfied smile
I remember you all since I can remember
anything.'

Propose everybody all in a lump 
propose any mortal thing,' said Hal, who
was irritably fidgeting with his uniform ;
only, dean, don't propose that my wife is
a saint. I don't want to be laughed at ; '
and he walked away.

The dean looked after him with a
strange expression of pity. Then he shook
his head, and stood up smilingly as the
rest of the wedding-party came in.

Lady Romayne, looking handsome in
her lilac satin and purple velvet, went
about presiding and grouping her guests,
and settling everything like a fashionable
Juno. She had heard someone say that
Griselda ought to be painted by the
great portrait-painter, Rogers. And another

 Lady Romayne forgot whom ;
but, whoever it might be, he or she was a
remarkably sensible and far-seeing person
had come to her and said. ' Oh, Lady
Romayne, how L envy your privilege of
presenting your beautiful daughter-in-law !
She must be the belle of next season,'
et cetera, et ccEfeia. Lady Romayne's
clerical wedding promised to be a success.

She was already so triumphant that
she had failed to notice the swelling of
that vein on Hal's forehead  which meant
that Hal was in what his sisters called
one of his nasty tempers.' So, after
settling her nests for the few minutes'
wait before the breakfast, she went to
him full of confidence, and said, 

Oh, my dear boy, we are so fortunate !
The dear dean will drive us one of his eloquent
speeches. Of coarse it will be reported

in the newspapers. All the dean
says is reported  I don't know how or
why ; but it is so. Then Griselda  she is
really quite a success ! Every one thinks-her
so like a saint.'

Lady Romayne stopped short. Hal had
muttered something between his teeth that
she had frequently heard him mutter, and
which was like the low preliminary growl
of a coming thunderstorm.

Look here, mother ! ' he said, with the
old threatening gleam in his eyes. ' I've
always heard a man's wedding-day is
the worst in his life ; don't you help to-prove
the saying in my case.' And he
turned away and began to talk to his
former tutor, now a middle-aged clergyman
in possession of a fruitful vine and
many olive branches, who had begun
smiling  nervously and doubtfully,  when.

he arrived, and was still smiling  to conceal
how his doubts had already grown.
Poor Mr Withers ! He had seen race
in his former pupil's face, and made a
desperate effort to say something pleasant.
He talked of the bride's sweetness and
goodness, of how thankful he was for
Hal that he had been directed in his
choice of a wife.

You will no longer be tormented by
your old wild fancies, my dear Mr Romayne,'
he said, dropping the familiar
Hal,' now that this tempestuous Mr
Romayne had arrived at the dignity of
being a married man. * If you could have
seen the grief and affection of the Crows-foot
parishioners when Mrs Romayne drove
away! It was like the old tales of the
people clinging to a departing saint.'

Beg your pardon, Withers ; I am

VOL. HI. E

wanted.' Hal rushed off. ' If they would
only call her a she-deva, I believe I should
prefer it,' he said, as he went to his wife,
who was not looking after him, but was
seated on an ottoman, calmly conversing,
as if she had grown there to talk and be
talked to.

John Blackett was standing near to his
child. He tried not to look depressed for
her sake. But of late she had seemed so
to supply her mother's place  it was very
hard, this parting. He, too, began to
realise what this marriage meant for him
for her  for Hal.

We must not have you gloomy, Mr
Blackett,' said Lady Romayne, in a high
contralto voice, pitched that all might
hear. ' Your dear daughter will soon return.
We  indeed, society cannot spare
her. Ah, if only her distinguished grandfather,

the famous professor, could have
lived to be here to-day ! '

It was well that breakfast was announced,
and that Lady Romayne, who
had got through the programme of her
preprandlal behaviour in the drawing-room
 always somewhat of a difficult
time at weddings did not, as she stood
and fanned herself, waiting to follow her
guests, see the face of John Blackett, of
the bride's father.

Almost a passion of wrath arose within
him at this coarse mention of the facts of
his life most sacred to him. He  who
had hardly schooled himself yet to think
of the father who turned his back upo
him when he was born, that father who
had persistently shunned him and disclaimed
him, and had salved his conscience
hy post-mortem gifts  to have his parentage

flung vulgarly In his face by his old
enemy, Lady Romayne !

He calmed himself for Griselda's sake ;
so did Hal, as far as he could. So the
wedding-banquet went off to Lady Romayne's
satisfaction.

The white tables, with the gold plate
and glass centre-piece, all graceful forms
showed well against the polished walls
Griselda cut her cake with perfect composure,
and was only amused when a huge
piece of hard sugar tumbled Into her lap.
It was all a fairy tale  a bright dream to
her. To-morrow, she thought, with a
saddened smile, she might awake to a
long life of difficulties. At least to-day
she might be as happy as she pleased !

The dean's speech put the finishing
touch to Lady Romayne's content. It
was brief and graceful. He began by a

short history of his acquaintance with
Hal, putting his best points in the most
favourable light. He said truthfully that
the bridegroom had that gift of all gifts,
a good heart. His friend once, you were
his friend always. And he even believed,
personally, that a friend under a cloud
was dearer to Henry Romayne than the
friend who was basking in the hot sunshine
of success. He could speak from
personal experience. For, although he
had seen comparatively little of Henry
Romayne since he himself had been a
successful man  therefore a busy man,
whose real friends made a point of respecting
the value of his time  there had
been years, not so very long ago, when,
but for to-day's bridegroom and his timely
help, he might have died in a miserable
lodeinof for want of actual warmth and

food. No doubt many could tell a similar
tale, with Henry Romayne as its hero,
and would, if they only knew, say, to-day,
as heartily as he did  God bless him [
Not only that ; but these would join him
in congratulations at having so soon met
with so sweet a lady as the bride, as his
companion and helpmeet through life.
None, after a glance at Mrs Henry Romayne,
could but feel that in this cold, hard
world her husband had found a blossom
in the snow. Of course all present knew
how this lovely lady, whose health on this
her marriage-day it was his privilege to
propose, had bloomed in the snow one
Christmas-eve ; not a bright Christmas-eve
like this, but in the midst of a cruel
hurricane, a fearful storm. And no doubt
that many who were present would draw
a curious parallel, and would scarcely wonder

that a babe, born In a stable, although
without visible protecting angels, and born
at this holy time, might be destined to be
so gentle, so patient, that the almost worshipping
affection of her father's parishioners
which he had seen to-day would bea
matter of course. He concluded by an
allusion to the beautiful name of Griselda,
and mentioned his confident hope that in
no single instance would this Griselda's
fate be like her celebrated namesake's, so
quaintly told by the father of English
poetry. No ; he might say that, just as
Henry Romayne had been so fortunate
as to find a rare blossom  say, the Edel-
weiss  on his upward path of manly life, so
he would wear it upon his heart till death,
to find it again in the gardens of Paradise.
Although successful, Dean Trevor had
made the wedding party feel much as if

they had returned to church. However,
the bridesmaids and Lady Romayne soon
retired to help Griselda dress for her
journey ; and there were the chirps of
admiration over the traveling dress, which
was of shaded grey velvet trimmed with
white fur.

'It has been perfect!' said Lady Romayne,
as she warmly embraced her
Edelweiss,' as she intended to nickname
her daughter-in-law. 'Simply perfect!
Mind, love, you must come back much
sooner than Hal intends to. You must
assert yourself. You must not put up
with his tempers. You must begin as you
mean to go on. See how I manage Sir
Hubert! It is your duty to manage Hal
imitate me.'

Don't frighten her, mother,' said Lydia
compassionately.

When you have had enough of his
tempers you come home to us. Union is
strength,' said Mabel, who was busily
buttoning Griselda's gloves, while the
other bridesmaids were actively collecting
the satin slippers to be thrown after the
happy pair.

Meanwhile Hal was storming at his
valet in the gun-room, where several
items of luggage had been placed pro
tern, Hugh Blunt heard ; and, biting his
lips as he remembered that this man was
now lord and master of the girl whom he
believed to be the one and only love of
his life, he went into the gun-room to see
if he could coax Mr Romayne into a less
irritable frame of mind.

Oh, it is you, lucky fellow, come to
gloat over me, plunged into all this
bother!' said Hal, viciously kicking at a

portmanteau. ' Go. No, thanks ; you
can't help me. Who can help a man
who has made a fool of himselfe'

The passionate outburst had barely
left his lips before he turned, and saw
Griselda.

Hugh Blunt paled, and stepped aside.
What he felt he could not have told ; it
was indescribable.

Hal flushed to the roots of his hair
when he saw his young wife. Had she
overheard '. Had she ' thought anything
? ' Oh no ! Impossible ; she looked
cheerful, bright, in her slate - coloured
velvets and white furs, like a sunshiny
winter landscape.

But she had heard ; his speech had
seemed to stab her heart. Only she used
her gift of self-command. She had not
to be warned by Lady Romayne and her

sisters-in-law of what she might expect.
One day, not very long ago, she had told
herself that she knew Hal better than he
knew himself.

Good-bye,' she said, turning to Hugh
Blunt, with her gloved hand outstretched.

What was it  the look in her eyes 
that told him she knew, or suspected, the
life she was boldly embarking upon .
1 He could not tell. But added to his old
love for her came a great respect, a wonder
at one so weak, who could be so strong.

Then came the embracing and parting
words, and the waving of handkerchiefs,
as the carriage with the four greys drove
off. One of the leaders shied at a satin
slipper that flew upon his nose, but the
bride and bridegroom soon vanished from
view behind the great trees in the snowy
park, to meet their fate.

T was not an ordinary honeymoon.


Griselda saw that Hal was
already repenting his coolness and irritability.
She had silently forgiven him
in advance. They had barely driven out
of the park, the white turrets of Feather's
Court were still in sight, when she
clasped one of his hands in both hers,
and said, 

Oh, Hal, you are good to me  to leave
all this, and take me, such a poor companion!
I have crossed the sea, but never

stayed near It, And I have so longed,
so dreamed of the great, green, surging
water, and the sense of being cut off
from foreign nations by those roaring
waves  it seems impossible that in a
few hours I shall be there.'

And tossing about on those roaring
waves,' said Hal,  recovering himself ashe
thought, ' She can't have overheard
that speech of mine.'  ' For we must cross
to-nisfht. I can't stand those English
watering-places.'

However, when they reached Dover,

Griselda's innocent delight at the towers

)

ing cliffs crowned by the old castle, with
the great waves foaming as they rolled
in upon the beach, made Hal change his
mind. They stayed at Dover two. three
days  bright winter days, which were
landmarks in Griselda's life. It hardly

seemed like Christmas Day, dining alone
in the half-empty hotel. But their host
and the servants made much of them,
and Hal's state of mind was marvellous
to himself.

Wonders will never cease he thought
to himself, as he and Griselda fought
their way against a brisk sea-breeze,
laughing, and battling with the wind,
like two children. 'I to be amused, to
be made happy by this sort of thing !
Griselda is a witch.'

She was intensely devoted all through
that short winter day. But, during their
sea-side rambling, fresh visitors had arrived
at the hotel ; to his dismay, he
read the names of General and Lady
Hermione Grayburgh on piles of luggage
that were being carried into the
hall.

Griselda ran upstairs quickly ; the wind
had toasted her hair, she felt untidy,
and on the first landing knocked up
against a tall lady in brown velvet, who
abashed her with a surprised glance
from a pair of superb black eyes. If 
as Griselda went on to her room, where
her new maid had been expecting her,
and had a warm gown and slippers ready
she could have guessed how that
haughty dame would make her suffer,
even that very day !

For Hal had been petted and spoiled
by Lady Hermione, General Grayburgh's
young and beautiful wife. He had been
always ' hanging about the house ' till
lately. And since then Lady Hermione
had drooped somewhat, and on Hal's
marriage day her physician had told the
General that her ladyship required change

of scene immediately, and he must really
think of interior abroad.

All Hal's good humour fled at the
sight of those names. ' The question is
what to do ? ' he thought, as he went
into the empty billiard-room and paced
about, gazing absently at the maps, at
the railway guides, at the stands of cues.
Can't start to-night in this beastly gale.
Besides, there is something cowardly in
flying from her. She can't say anything
against me. No ; the best thing is to
stay and face it out. Surely I have a
right to marry when and how I please,
just the same as any other fellow ! '

So he went to Griselda, dio was sitting
before her fire in her blue wrapper,
while Marshall, the maid, was brushing
all her long, fair hair, and asked her to
dress and go into their draw-ing-room.

Some people I know are here,' he
said nonchalantly,  ' General and Lady
Hermlone Grayburgh. I must call in
and see them, and they will return the
visit, I suppose.'

Griselda assured him she would be
ready ; and he went off and called
upon the General and his wife  a
visit of mockery, he felt, but necessary ;
and he and Lady Hermione laughed and
chatted, and the General tried to make
some ponderous jokes ; then the three
adjourned to Hal's apartments, where
Griselda met them at the drawing-room
door, and welcomed her husband's friends
with a gentle dignity which made Lady
Hermione hate her with a cold, deadly
hate there and then.

Lady Hermione saw a girl dressed asa
young matron, in an exquisite costume

VOL. TIL F

Lady Romayne had ordered specially for
Griselda from Paris. This was a rich,
green satin polonaise embroidered with
sprigs of jasmine, the prettiest of striped
green and white silk.

Perfect taste ! ' savagely thought the
friend that had liked Hal Romayne not
wisely, but too well. Then her eyes
travelled upward to the fair oval face,
with its gentle dignified expression, but
with a certain anxiety in the lovely
eyes.

Some little school girl ! ' she thought,
with a rush of satisfaction at the thought
that at least she was superior to Hal's
wife. ' Some entanglement  some freak,
no doubt ! Poor Hal ! '

She held out her hand and shook
Griselda's with an affection of warmth.
Then she turned her languid dark eyes

upon Hal, and, with a little silvery laugh,
said, 

I don't think I was ever so surprised
in my life ! To think of the charming
little girl I ran up against in the passage
this morning being the wife of my old
friend Hal ! It seems incredible. Do
you know, Mrs Romayne, I looked after
you with envy, thinking, ' Ah, youth on
the prow, pleasure at the helm ! There
goes a child who is not weary and heartsick,
because she does not know the
world. The Dead Sea apples and the
bitter dregs are to come. Ah, Hal, you
have a heavy responsibility ! Who would
have thought that you, who have lived
through so many hot noons of life, would
dream of stealing a flower fresh with
mornings dew ? '

She had assumed a graceful, half-tired

attitude on a catiseuse near the uncomfortable
elbow-chair on which Griselda
had somewhat stiffly seated herself.
Griselda gazed on this beautiful lady,
who spoke with such ease and grace
that her speech sounded like Greek
verse  with dismay. Was this being,
who reminded her of a picture on a
Bordeaux plum-box Hugh Blunt had
given her one Christmas, an Oriental
beauty reclining on a divan, some bird
with a long chain gracefully perched on
her wrist,  a specimen of the women
Hal had known  whom she was to supplant
?

The old General, who liked pretty
young girls, luckily came to the rescue.
He did not quite understand his wife 
never had. But he knew when her
sweetly-modulated voice meant mischief

for then she spoke more slowly, more
like a well-practised chime of bells. And
he did not see why my lady should flout
that pretty young bride. So he got up
and stamped about a bit ; then, getting
rather red in the face, he slapped Romayne
on the back.

I tell you what, my boy,' he said in
his blunt way, ' I needn't to think much
of you when you were hanging about at
my lady's kettledrums ; I set you down
with the rest of the dawdle. But, 'pon
my honour, I see you're a man of sense,
and the very first time I can do-ou
and your young madam a service, I'll doit
 by Jove, I wall ! Now you two come
and dine with us to-night, and talk it
over  eh, my lady . '

My lady,' whose eyes had met Hal's
with an old look which appealed, ' See

how I am unappreciated by this savage ! '
was languidly charmed. She thought of
a certain toilette she had, and of how
fortunate it was that she had ordered a
Broadsword to be sent into their rooms
she had played more since she had
lost Hal as she called it.

I have played so much of your
favourite music since you cut us she
said to him with a meaning glance.
And I made a bargain with the General
that I should find a piano wherever we
stayed. Of course you play, Mrs Romayne
? '

The oroan  a little said Griselda
with a pang. This was worse and
worse. As she went to the door and
watched Lady Hermione gliding gracefully
along the corridor, Hal bending
over her, and the white-haired General,

with his gold-headed stick, stumping
along in the rear, she remembered a
saying which struck her very much 
was it Hugh Blunt's ?  ' Fighting itself
is of no good without an intimate knowledge
of the foe.'

And I '  she stopped short, dismayed
' oh, what will come of it all ? ' thought
poor Griselda.

RISELDA stood in the hotel
drawing-room, gazing blankly
at the huoe conventional furniture.
All  from the glittering chandeliers
pendant from the heavy ceiling to
the handsomely decorated walls, with a
few well-known prints hanging here and
there, seemed so desolate  so unhomelike.
The risings ease shrieked and howled without
; the big windows, well-secured as
seaside palatial hotel-windows usually are,
attempted a faint rattle. The coal-fire
in the big steel grate, which had burnt

low, shivered and collapsed, while a
gust of smoke blew across the fire-guard
into the room. Absently twisting her
wedding - ring and the pearl circlet
Hal had given her as ' keeper,' she
vaguely felt that the even flow of the
honeymoon had been checked since this
meeting with the kindly old General and
his beautiful young wife, Lady Hermione.
Those dark eyes  those pencilled brows !
Griselda had seen the eloquent glance,
half-sad, half-sympathetic, of those dark
orbs when they were fixed upon Hal.
Did every woman, would every woman 
look at her husband like that ? ' They
must have been great, great friends,'
Griselda thought, looking vaguely, with
a new pain, longing, fear of she knew
not what, at the prints on the walls 
Against the Tide,' a young couple ina

boat, who had evidently had a disagreeable
discussion and were struggling
up-stream, and ' With the Tide,' where
all, the lovers and their surroundings,
seemed sunshine and peace. Then she
caught sight of her travelling-desk, her
father's gift.

Hal will stop some time at their rooms,
I daresay,' she thought, with a sinking
heart. ' I will write to father.'

She opened the desk. In the bustle of
the wedding and the packing, Griselda
had had no time to unlock and examine
John Blackett's wedding-gift to his
daughter. As she looked over the desk
now, she was deeply touched to find that
all her little tastes as a scribe were not
only known to, but had been carefully
remembered by, her father. The pens
she had found the readiest, the writing-paper,

most of the materials she had
used In preference as his amanuensis,
were there to hand, and  that which she
seized almost with eager passion  a letter,
the superscription ' For Griselda.'

She tore It open with trembling fingers.
What would be his parting counsel
? Her father had said but little to
her that wedding-morn, a few days back,
which already seemed weeks  no  months

Griselda,' John Blackett had written
I wonder when you will find this ? Not
in your happiest moments, my child, I
expect. Whenever it may be, think first
that, although separated from your father,
to whom you are naturally the dearest on
earth, that earthly separation is a mere
term ; it Is actually but a waiting for our

near meeting. I am here, ready, when
you want me. Now a few words about
your present Hfe. I did not wish to
croak, like an old raven, when you were
on the threshold of your young happiness.
And pray do not take this as a croak
But I must warn you of that which Is
most young married people's stumbling-block
 the expecting too much from each
other. To live at a high pitch of any
sort Is difficult, and, In point of fact, unnatural.
Do not fancy that a yawn ora
short silence means bore, or the first
symptom of a man's being tired of his
wife. Only a man dislikes a chain as
much as that nobler animal, the dog. 
Ever your father, John Blackett.'

Griselda almost smiled. How like her
father, as he had been, since his life-burdens

had been lifted from his weary
shoulders !

She seized a sheet of note-paper and
wrote 

Father,  It is useless to add anything
to the word which means the
nearest, holiest tie, is it not ? I have
just found your dear letter. I will not
say whether it came at a moment of
difficulty ; but it certainly strengthened
me and reminded me of  '

My duty,' she would have written.
But the pen slipped from her fingers.

Hal had kicked open the door, which
was ajar, and stood there, looking disgustedly
at the smoke which was gracefully
floating in grey clouds just below
the ceiling.

What the deuce do they mean by this
sort of thing?' he said, with suppressed
anger. * Fire out too ! Why didn't you
ring ? ' Then he rang, and going to the
window, muttered something barely audible,
which sent the blood to Griselda's
cheeks, about ' unlucky devil,' etc.

What do you mean by this ? ' he thundered
at the waiter who had flown in
answer to No. 20's noisy summons. ' Putting
me into a room poisoned with smoke !
Bring me my bill and serve luncheon at
once. I cross by the next boat."

The startled waiter expostulated, murmuring
something about ' blowing oreat
guns ' and ' cone being hoisted.'

Do what I say, d'ye hear ? And send
my valet.'

The waiter flew.

See your maid, my dear, tell her to

pack, and change to your travelling-gown
at once, will you ? '

The thin veil of assumed tenderness
hurt Griselda more than if he had stormed
at her.

But  Hal  I thought  those people 
asked us to dinner  and you accepted  '

Hal, strolling about the room, his hands in
his pockets, laughed. It was a nasty laugh.
It meant much, and Griselda winced.

My dearest child, you will, of course,
have to write an excuse. You cannot
possibly go into society till you have
seen something of the world and have
had a little training from my mother. I
love your simplicity, dear,' he added more
kindly. ' Of course, you don't understand
; but you will by-and-by. Come
you are writing  just put that aside
and write a note I will dictate to you.'

Griselda obediently laid aside the half-covered
sheet, and began  according to
Hal's dictation 

Dear Lady Hermione  '

She looked up. It seemed rather
strange to address the regal lady of the
almond eyes thus ; but of course Hal
knew, so it must be all right.

Write your own bold manuscript hand,
said Hal. Then he dictated, ' I am so
sorry, but I have just received a telegram
from my father.'

Griselda glanced up. * Oh, Hal,' she
said, 'have you had one?'

Hal stamped his foot impatiently. This
was too silly !

Of course not,' he said. ' Don't you
understand ? I have been racking my
brains how to get off without offending
the General and Lady Hermione, and

that is the only excuse I could possibly
think of;

But it is not true. I will write anything
you like that is true ; but not a lie, Hal.'

Griselda ! '  Hal checked an unkind
speech ; but he felt choked with rage.

The beautiful Lady Hermione, who, in
days not so very long ago, had played
upon his sentiments, his whole nature, asa
consummate artist plays upon an intricate
musical instrument, had asserted
her supremacy, had overturned the simple,
almost childish joys of these first
days of dual solitude with his girlish wife.
He had felt, as Lady Hermione clasped
his hand and glanced one of her old
glances straight into his eyes, that his
safety was in flight  not only his safety,
but his loyalty to Griselda. It enraged
him that Griselda should be an obstacle,

VOL. III. G

when he was trying his best for her
sake.

*Then, if your conscience is so extremely
sensitive,' he said, in a strange
constrained voice, ' you must really find
your own excuses. What is that ? '

He saw Mr Blackett's letter lying half-open
on the table, and would have seized
it ; but Griselda put her hand firmly down
upon the paper.

That is a letter from my father,' she
said ; ' I found it in the desk  here.'

I thought there should be no secrets
between husband and wife.'

Hal's anger was at its height. But,
being at a white heat, he seemed calm.

I do not know whether he intended
anyone else to read it,' pleaded Griselda,
looking earnestly at her husband.

Curious, for a clergyman, who is supposed

to consider man and wife as
one ! '

Read my reply,' said Griselda eagerly.

Hal took the sheet, and, as he read,
an ugly sneer spread itself about his
mobile mouth.

Thank you,' he said drily. ' I compliment
you on your duplicity either to
myself or to your father. Yesterday, I
was your best beloved, according to your
own saying. To-day, because, as I am
forced to believe, you are meanly jealous
of one of the queens of society, the reason
being that I paid her the ordinary attentions
she is accustomed to,  your father
is  what ? '  he consulted the note.
Pah ! Romantic stuff! Tear it up! And
please tear up that you began to Lady
Hermione. I will explain matters myself.'

Here his valet, successor to poor Chancel,

who was killed in the eventful railway
accident, came in ; but Hal left
Griselda, giving his orders as he went
towards Lady Hermione's rooms.

He found her reclining in a shady
corner. She started as he came in. All
her old passion had rushed back  she had
been dreaming of bygone happy hours
never to return. Her eyes were tearful.

The General is  in his room she
stammered.

He was softened by her emotion. She
looked so gentle, so womanly ; and Hal's
excitement led him to feel an atmosphere
of love about this siren, who had formerly
held him in chains, and who had behaved, he
thought, at this crisis, with great gentleness
and magnanimity to her escaped captive.

I wanted to speak to you,' he said
falteringly, with some new emotion he

hardly understood. ' May I  may I sit
by you, as in the old '  he paused and
sighed  ' the old days ? '

She looked at him almost fearfully.
Then she bowed her head, and said,
Yes '  the sort of ' yes ' which is given
to some great, some vital question, rather
than the careless ' yes ' of ordinary life.

He sat down on a basket-chair by her
sofa. There was a bowl of hot-house
blooms on a tiny table beside him, a tiger-skin
at his feet. Lady Hermione travelled
with accessories  indispensable accessories,
as she considered them. Hal felt
the difference between this room and his
own  one so well arranged, so refined, the
other bare, cold, smoky  acutely. ' I have
come,' he began. Then he hesitated, and
the blood rushed to his forehead. He
leaned forward, clasping his hands, dumb.

You have come ! ' gently repeated
Lady Hermlone.

To tell you that I have changed my
plans. I shall cross this afternoon.' One
moment's silence.

In this gale ?' asked Lady Hermione ;
and her voice trembled. She was bitterly
disappointed. She believed that to-night
she might have gone far to re-establish
the old friendship.

Can you not understand that it is
better for me ? '

In his new anger with Griselda he spoke
almost with passion to this old love, who,
although almost his superior in worldly
position, and most certainly far above him
in intellect, as women's intellects go, had
never 'defied' him, as he chose to think
his young wife had done on the subject
of her father's letter.

'As you will. You know, Hal, I have
always thought you have acted for the
best. But, will you leave me, now, at
once ? ' she went on, suddenly rislno- from
her sofa, and holding out her delicate
white hands with an imploring gaze.
For Heaven's sake, go ! '

Hal rose, agitated. What ? There
were great tears in those large dark eyes
that he had seen look so coldly upon the
world, so scornfully upon gay crowds of
adulators, so adoring into his own.

For a few seconds they looked steadily
at each other ; and the past, that delirium
of Hal's, when he gave rein to impulse,
and had recklessly followed the promptings
of the moment  when he hung about
Lady Hermione, and no day passed without
that delicious talk, and those half-confidences,
half-suggestions, and whole

honos silences which mean more than words
or looks  the memory of those days passed
through the minds of both, as they saw a
procession of the thoughts, words, actions,
and Incidents of their lives review themselves
rapidly before those who are near
unto death.

Lady Hermione was not a bad woman,
and her affection for Hal had been the
strongest sentiment of her life. And
Hal ? Fiercely, bitterly he remembered
his doubts, his sudden terror, when he
had realised that he was bound to gentle,
innocent Griselda for life. Unthinking,
he had drifted to his fate, and here he
suddenly found himself, on one side Scylla,
on the other Charybdis.

Good-bye,' he said  merely the one
word ; but the anguish in his tone was
balm to Lady Hermione's disappointment.

Do be happy ! ' she earnestly said.
If I only know you are happy, my dear
boy, I do not care what becomes of
me!'

Happy ! ' said Hal, dropping her
hands ; and, with head bent, walking
respectfully from her presence, as if she
were a princess. Formerly, when he was
the spoilt darling, coming in and going
out of the ' gem of a town residence ' in
Mayfair when and how he pleased, he had
given himself airs there as he did in his
home, nettling Lady Hermione somewhat,
although she did not choose to show it.
Now she had become unattainable, an
impossibility  therefore, to Hal, inexpressibly
desirable.

Happy ! ' he savagely repeated to himself
with a Byronic bitterness as he went
downstairs to calm himself with a cigar.

What evil chance brought me to Griselda
that day at Cologne, again in London,
again after that accident ! What a fate for
us both  utterly unsuited to each other !
Poor child, poor child ! '

While Lady Hermione had stood
motionless where Hal had left her.

I used to think him gloriously handsome,'
she mused ; but never, never have
I imagined him as now  the ideal of a
fallen angel or Manfred. Well, I have
nothing to blame myself for ! '

She went to the great mirror over the
mantelpiece and gazed at her own beauty.
In the light of the great fire  the sky was
darkening with folds of dismal clouds, and
the flames half lit the room  she saw that,
If the freshness of youth were no longer
there, there was a grander, more imposing
splendour about her pathetic face and

moulded figure, which might be compared
to Griselda's peaceful loveliness as a
storm in a pine-forest, with lurid gleams
between the thunder-shower, to a lily-pond
in green fields under a smiling
spring sky.

Perhaps,' she thought. Then, after
one more glance, a triumphant expression
brightened her eyes.

Not perhaps,' she thought, remembering
some news her husband. General
Grayburgh, had read to her that very
morning from the leading daily paper.
Let them go honeymooning like little
Cupids among the roses  poor child,
should I grudge her her day ? He
has caused her trouble enough, I
know ! But it will be soon over. And
then  '

She stepped across the room and opened

the window. This new idea oppressed
her. She wanted air, light.

Then,' she went on to herself, gazing
out on the green, angry sea  * then my
turn will come ! I think I can afford to
wait.'

OW little did Griselda  as she
struggled on board the packet
bound for Calais, chilled, depressed,
for her three days' bridegroom
had been, at the best, morose, since the
unfortunate meeting with his old friends 
think how and by what she would be
befriended !

The afternoon sky was leaden, the sea a
dark blackish green, which, as the waves
seemed as if they had suddenly begun
civil war and were fighting furiously
among themselves, had an ominous deadly
look, like the green of some poisonous

plants. The wind seemed to blow from
all quarters at once, not as one wind, but
many. There was the great sea-breeze,
which seemed to rush with a gigantic rush
steadily through and beside and below and
above every obstruction, and sweep landwards
with a calm contempt of earth.
But there were also wandering gusts that
shrieked and walled on their own account,
and Icy little breezes that went about
rapidly, biting the nerves and hissing into
the ears like air-snakes, while they froze
fingers, toes, and crept under wraps to
stab where and how they could.

Roar, rage on the sea, screech, whistle
In the sky  no wonder the rattling and
shouting, as the heaving little black packet
was loaded by the struggling porters and
sailors as best they could, was lost in the
noise of the hurricane ! The captain,

whose hoarse shouts from the paddle-box
where he stood were barely heard, stared
to see an English gentleman with a
delicate young girl on his arm struggling
across the deck. He leaned down and
called to Hal as he passed, 

If it weren't for the mails, we shouldn't
go, sir, and we may have to put back.'

'All right!' shouted Hal in return;
then he went with Griselda and Marshall,
her maid, to the cabin. Leaving them to
the stewardess, who looked sulky, for, if
there had been no lady passengers, she
could have braved the dirty ' weather '
more comfortable'.

They say it's an ill wind that blows
nobody good, Griselda,' was Hal's temporary
farewell. ' Let's hope we are the
nobodies.'

Were they ? At all events, this gale

was Griselda's friend. For they tumbled
about the Channel for four mortal hours.
Four hours of physical torture to Hal,
who, though he supposed himself a good
sailor, found himself prostrate and wishing
that his valet  who was prostrate
also or the steward, or the captain, or
anybody  would throw him overboard.

Every woman he knew, Including
Griselda and Lady Hermlone, might have
died before his smarting eyes would
have turned to look at them. The gale
and the sea had come to Griselda's
rescue. She had sat calmly while the
boat reeled to Calais on the waves
like some rudderless, helpless cockle-shell
bathe her maid's head with eau de
Cologne, and comforting some crying
children whose mother was ' down ' In an
opposite berth, while she was the envy

of the sour stewardess, who said she
couldn't do nothing for no one, having
that pain in her head on these awful
journeys, when ladies who choose to
take the risk must really expect to look
after themselves.'

It came to her rescue, for it sobered
Hal, and sharply but decisively cured
his capricious fit of romance. When they
were in harbour, and Griselda met him
on deck leaning dejectedly upon the
steward's arm, she seemed like a special
mercy, standing there so straight and
fresh and smiling and ready, she was the
only member of the four capable of action.
She it was who helped the polite officers
of the ' Duane' in their examination of
the luggage. She hailed close conveyances
to drive to the station ; and when
her limp charges had struggled aimlessly

VOL. III. H

into the warm, bright refreshment-room,
where all was so neat,  well-dressed
French barmaid smiling in the freshest
of costumes behind the buffets, joyous-looking
French waiters rushing about ina
superior but sympathetic manner,  it
was she who enlisted one of the waiters
with a timely tip, and supplied both her
lord and master and their servants with
hot bouillon and tiny glasses of French
brandy.

You are a born nurse, Griselda,' was
Hal's speech of acknowledgment as they
took their seats in the railway carriage.

If that engine would only stop
screeching and whistling ! ' he added
pettishly.

Yes, that prosaic and painful crossing
seemed to have snapped the link between
Hal and his friend Lady Hermione

Grayburgh. She was In the past. And
in some way, as the train rattled through
the snowy landscape ornamented with
rows of blackened skeletons of trees,
Hal felt that she was done with, over,
that he was in a new mood  perhaps
not an agreeable one ; still, the future,
dreary as it might prove to be, could
not possibly contain the being who buta
few hours ago seemed to him almost
the central figure of his whole life.

'How should it.' he thought. 'Weare
not likely to meet again. No ; that
dream that fluctuated between the delights
of the haschish-drinker and the
fiendish illusions of the victims of
dcliriiun tremens is past, as the mere
dream that it was.'

The new, rational Hal Romayne chose
a quiet hotel, and settled himself and his

young wife in Paris in a deliberate, calculating
way.

We shall stay two or three months,'
he told Griselda. * As soon as you have
seen the sights and are accustomed to
the gaiety and everything, I will lookup
my old friends, the Duchess de M  ,
the Comtesse B  , Madame de S  .
French ladles have such extraordinary
savoir faire. And from the very contrast
between you, with your English
nature, and they, I believe you might
become quite an acquired taste in Parisian
salons. After that, my mother would find
your introduction to English society a
comparative easy matter.'

Griselda scarcely understood. But,
since she had seen Lady Hermione, the
old feeling she had in childhood, when
she made her first appearance at Feather's

Court, that she and those who peopled
the world in which Hal lived were utterly
different,  was strengthened.

I must change,' she told herself. But
how to accomplish this ? The old habit
of thinking deeply and continually was
simply unconquerable. She made a constant
and vigorous effort to throw herself
out of herself, as it were  to forget that
she was Griselda Romayne, born Griselda
Black, or rather Blackett  and to be
merely a spectator, a pleased and gratified
spectator of these new scenes, just as Hal
seemed to be.

Yes ; Hal was no longer the stormy
lover, and was past settling down into
a kind but imperious husband, sometimes
passionate, at other times petulant,
given to short ebullitions of rage when
matters went wrong, or the letters from

England did not please him, but taking
a larger view of life and a more vivid
interest in his surroundings, and, in
Griselda's opinion, far more adorable, if
that could be possible, than ever.

Of late  this was after they had spent
a month in Paris  she was beginning to
feel a greater respect for the handsome
husband, who could scarcely show himself
on the Boulevards, or in theatres
and restaurants, without being admiringly
stared at. Why this was she could not
tell. She used to nurse the idea in her
mind with a new satisfaction, tenderness,
hope, particularly when she was alone,
and Hal had gone for a walk ; of late
she had felt so much fatigue that she
was glad that Hal let her off expeditions
and sight-seeing.

She had visited the theatres gravely.

This wondering gravity and her blushing
face, when Hal took her to see those
pieces which are piquant to the Parisian
temperament, first annoyed, then amused
him and flattered his vanity For he
soon noticed that the volatile French
treated Griselda with a strange respect.
Some felt reminded of the ' Sainte Verge,'
by her modest bearing and gentle face.
Others glanced at Hal, and  why they
hardly knew  were filled with chivalry on
behalf of the 'petite dame Anglaise.' To
Griselda Frenchmen seemed all Bayards,
and Frenchwomen smiling' sisters. It
puzzled her.

Two months, and Paris suddenly flung
aside her white mantle of ice, the cold
mist lifted, and she blossomed into spring.
Flowers appeared In balconies, bouquets
of early violets and lilac - bloom and

orange-blossom from the south scented
the florists' shops ; white parasols and
coloured awnings defied a burning spring
sun on the Boulevards. Hal took his
wife to the supreme Parisian artist in
costumes. He had already called on his
titled friends, who had returned his visit,
paying their respects to Griselda at the
same time, and invitation-cards lay on
Griselda's writing-table  accepted.

The handsome middle-aged Duchesse
dea  had perhaps been most charmed
with Griselda. She had always liked
Hal ; but Griselda won her enthusiasm.
She burst into eulogy of his bride to Hal,
as he gave her his arm to her carriage
after her visit.

Ah, Monsieur de Romain,' she said,
with an eloquent look, as she was seated
in her carriage and he lingered at the

door, 'your fortune is made with a petite
feiiinie that is Hke some dream that one
has in church when the choir sings and
the organ plays ! I am an old woman ;
I know it, so I may say what my heart
says. You should no more think of
bonnes fortunes. You possess a diamond.
Look no more upon Palais Royal paste ! '

What do they all mean ? ' Hal asked
himself. He soon found out.

Griselda, at the Duchesse's soiree, was
a fitroie. French tact would not allow
this fact to be obstrusively apparent.
But, while the men, congregating as
they will in Parisian drawing - rooms
in corners, in the withdrawing - room
the bolder in the outskirts of the
principal reception room where the ladies
sit, sometimes demurely, and always
with a certain coquettishness, on the

sofas, divans, arm - chairs   eyed the
fair bride with a certain shyness, and
the few who were Introduced bowed,
made a few complimentary remarks,
and departed quickly  the ladies were
charmed, delighted. At parting, young
girls curtseyed and blushingly held
their foreheads to be kissed, and many
of the married ladles embraced her
or rather kissed her  on both cheeks.

As for the Duchesse, whose sharp
eyes had frequently been fixed on the
'belle dame of Monsieur de Romain,'  
despite her many duties  she conducted
Griselda to her bedchamber, a stately
apartment, which might have been a
modern Imitation of the royal bed-chambers
at Hampton Court  and there
became sweetly maternal in her manner.

Ckmmante enfant! ' she said effusively.

And with so handsome 2. petit niari !
But '  then she laid her exquisitely
gloved hand lightly on Griselda's shoulder
' where is madame votre mhe ? '

Actual tears glistened in her eyes
when she found that the young wife was
motherless. She exacted a promise that
Griselda would come to her often,
very often.

Griselda was pleased to do so. She
instinctively felt that this good old
French lady was  or certainly might
be  a friend in need.

During the month that followed she
was much with the Duchesse. It was
an exciting month. Hal was roused 
perhaps he had never been so roused,
as by the accounts in his Times of the
outbreak in India, the first alarm of
the terrible mutiny.

We are sure to be ordered out,' he
said one afternoon, when the Duchesse
was taking a cup of English tea with
Griselda at the hotel. ' It Is Inevitable.
For my part, I thirst to be at those
black fiends as If I were a blood-hound ! '

Griselda dropped her teaspoon. She
was pale.

Monsieur de Romain,' said the
Duchesse somewhat solemnly, as Hal
escorted her down the wide staircase
shortly after, ' you must pardon me.
I am grandsire ! But, if you say
about these creatures so terribly, these
Indians of your belle Aigleteiie who
like her not  why  your petite dame
ravissante may die ! You may kill not
only this sweet wife, who loves you to
distraction, but  '

She paused, and looked him straight



in the eyes. * Volts coin pre nez?' she
said meaningly.

Merci, madame ;' and Hal stooped
and kissed her hand.

Best bien alors,' said the Duchesse.
And as she drove off, she felt she
had done her duty.

And Hal remained where he was 
bareheaded as he was  dazed, confused,
and, yes  why, he hardly knew 
horrified !

CHAPTER VII.

OST lives seem to begin with
a faint prophecy of their progress
and end. Childhood is
the keynote, telling of the scale which
must follow. Griselda was born in a
barn, in the snow  an exceptional birth.
She was an exceptional child, girl,
woman, who would seem destined to
an exceptional fate.

It was scarcely an ordinary marriage,
this of hers, the simple daughter of a
country parson, with Henry Romayne,
heir to a baronetcy, to wealth, to land.

Her honeymoon was disturbed by a
ghost from her husband's past unscrupulous
life. Then came a sudden
elevation. That three months In Paris,
In the sunshine and gaiety, petted, admired,
almost warmed Into a new outburst
of fresh young life by the sympathy
of the buoyant, butterfly natures
of Hal Romayne's P>ench acquaintances,
was a brief exquisite dream, destined to
end in a gloomy, even terrible awakening.
One day they were about to drive to
the ' Bols.' Hal, In his faultless British
morning-dress  which was the envy of
the Parisian dandies, already in love as
they were with English tailoring  was
strolling carelessly down the grand staircase
to smoke a cigarette before the
carriage came, when a telegram was
handed to him.

He felt a momentary thrill. Although
the news from India was ambiguous
and, to say the least of it, threatening,
he had been reassured by the ease with
which his extension of furlough had been
granted. He did not dream that good
old General Grayburgh, knowing that the
regiment was bound to be ordered out
sooner or later, had made intercession at
head-quarters for him, thinking it * hard
lines' for the handsome young pair to
be separated so soon, so cruelly, but inevitably.
So that his thoughts flew, first, homewards.
His father. Sir Hubert ? Griselda's
father ? His mother ? What was it }

He went into the divine-saloon, which
was a desert of white tables, and opened
the telegram.

As he read, he staggered, paled, and
sank in a chair, stunned.

Recalled  at once  regiment under
sailing-orders for India!

He clenched and crumpled the paper.
Then he groaned. His head fell upon
his breast, his clutch loosened, and the
flimsy messenger of ill-tidings dropped
flutteringly to the floor, where a soft
spring breezelet from the open window
caught and played with It In a sunbeam,
as if In mockery.

Then he started, 

O2C est Monsieur Romayne ? ' Grl-
selma's sweet, girlish voice  that had a
new resonance born of this joyous,
careless life  without !

He heard some one tell her as he
rose stiffly to his feet, ground his teeth,
and, seizing a carafe of water, poured
out a glassful and swallowed it. Then
he faced her, as she gently pushed open

VOL. III. I

the door and stood there half shyly,
waiting for Hal's approval of a pale
green velvet costume which he had
chosen for her.

How divinely fair she looked in her
beautiful dress, the very embodiment
of happy well-being,  with a faint blush
on her exquisite skin, a half-smile on
her lips, as she buttoned her gloves !
She was looking down, so she did not
see her husband's deadly pallor  his
agitation.

Charming  a greater success than I
expected ! ' he said, forcing his voice.
Come  there is the carriage ! '

'You are in a hurry,' said she, laughing.
She felt supremely happy this
golden spring day. ' I haven't half
finished those dreadful buttons. What
is that paper ? ' she added, looking back

as she went out. ' It looks like a banknotes



As far as I know, I am not in the
habit of dropping bank - notes about,'
said Hal, as he put her into the carriage.
' But I'll go and see.'

He went back and secured the telegram.
Chilled, unnerved, he stood uncovered,
tears in his eyes  and prayed
a short swift prayer  that his wife,
his good angel, might be spared.

He well knew how and in what way
she loved him. He could not tell
whether lie had the faintest suspicion
of impending separation, suspense, and
perhaps the agony of loss. And, as
for that warning of his good friend,
the Duchesse dea  , it had seemed to
him, though he had dared to approach
the subject once or twice  as if it would

be unseemly that Griselda should be
awakened from a happy present to a
serious future, however sacred and
beautiful now, by him, at this terrible
crisis, which might end in her early
widowhood.

No ; those tenderest, holiest confidences
between husband and wife must
remain hidden within his heart, while he
must deal the blow, and acquaint Gris-ella
with coming contingencies, as if by
accident. For a mental shock given
carelessly and seemingly without intention,
falls, perhaps, less heavily than
one driven home by force of will.

They drove along the gay boulevards,
the sun brightening the lively scene. It
might have been an Oriental city, so
gorgeous were the crimsons and yellows
and greens of the shop - awnings, so

brilliant the dazzling jewels in the
velvet-lined shop-fronts, and the display
of decorated baskets and ingenious surprise
bonbonnieres in the windows, where
glistening sweets, fragrant chocolate, and
marrons glands tempted the pretty little
walking dolls, the Parisian children.
- The motley pedestrians  first, the men
who thought themselves models of
elegance with their tiny waists and long
twisted moustaches, their glossy boots,
tightly-gloved hands, and accessories of
cane tucked under arm, clear in mouth,
and curly-brimmed hat perched on one
side ; then the decorous ladies, accompanied
by children and bonnes in neat
white caps, carrying market-baskets or
children's playthings ; and the pretty
impertinent grisettes, or the red-faced
outriders in their blouses  most of these

not only glanced at Griselda as she
drove by, but stayed and stared after
her with the appreciative French stare,
a thing of itself quite apart from all
other stares prevalent in all other cities.

Hal saw, and was gratified even in
his new passion of grief  boyish grief.
A glance at Griselda, so placidly sweet
and smiling, and he was perilously near
a convulsive sobbing-fit. He roused his
courage. But speak to her, here, now .'*
It was impossible !

Suddenly he rose, knelt on the opposite
seat, and ordered the coachman
to drive into the country, He wanted
to go to some village  any pretty village
where Madame might see a farm
and wood, if possible  some village
vvhere one might almost forget Paris, if
one could.

The coachman, after some pondering,
decided upon his route, and informed
Hal with a certain gravity that he
would do his best. Then, as Hal resumed
his seat, the man whipped up his horses
and drove on at a rattling pace.

My dear  whatever is he doing ?
Griselda, clutching her husband, looked

alarmed.

Only driving a little faster,' said Hal
reassuringly. But his spirits sank as he
saw Griselda pale, her eyes very blue,
and a scared expression on her delicate
face.

I don't know what can have come
to me,' she said, with a faint blush of
shame, as she caught sight of her husband's
anxious eyes. ' Hal, Paris
seems to have transformed me. All my
old pluck has gone. I used to think

nothing of holding a child when Doctor
Mayne operated ; or to thread the
needles if he had to sew up a cut ; I
never seemed to think anything but
that I was doing a necessary duty 
but now ! Oh, Marshall brought me
the paper  I was in bed  she said
something about some atrocity in India
 oh, Hal, I am not fit to be a
soldier's wife ! I  Can you forgive
me ? I fainted.'

Her words simply roused Hal to desperation.
Now the state of desperation,
which is not despair  not recklessness,
not a negative, foolish kicking against
the pricks  is a sensation greatly underrated.
For in an unreal state of excitement
it is the friend in need  it tides
over bad minutes, it bridges over the
gulf of absolute hopelessness as no

other feeling possible to humanity
could.

The desperate are cold, hard as ice.
They seem callous. They think and
talk as wisely, perhaps more wisely, than
they ever did in their whole lives before.
No one suspects their wretched,
most wretched state.

When Hal heard his wife, in her
utter innocence, wondering at her own
weakness,  he could have groaned aloud.
But desperation helped him to behave
as wisely as any ancient sage.

My darling ! ' he said, turning a
radiant, if slightly haggard, face upon
her, ' I can explain all you feel, as, unselfish
as you are, you would not think
of doing to yourself. You are so bound
to Crowsfoot ! Your whole being resents
your lengthened absence. Well,

we will return at once, before we are
ordered off to India.'

His hands clasped hers. He looked
away at the road into which the
barouche had just turned  a road so
narrow that the ungainly weeds in the
ditch on Hal's side swept the carriage-wheels.
Rising from his stooping position,
he took one of her hands and
patted it to the time of a tune he was
whistling. He did not look at her.

A greyness crept over her beautiful
earnest face, a horror darkened her eyes.
One instant showed her her fate. She
did not see the young spring green of
the hedges and the budding trees  she
saw a sloping country where white fortresses
with many strange-looking domes
towered above the Eastern buildings,
above the tropical foliage that drooped in

the lurid heat under the cloudless
coppery sky. Not only this, she saw
men in Indian uniform struggling in
hand-to-hand fiorht, a few of the British
cavalry dashing hither and thither, sabre-king
right, left, front ; she saw black heads
falling among fountain-spirits of blood.

Then the moment's agony passed, and
with strained aching eyes she saw the
quiet French country again.

I thought that this summons would
come very soon, my dearest,' she said,
clasping her husband's arm. ' And it
has found you ready. Oh, my Hal, how
proud I am to see you so calm ! Why,
I never for one instant imagined you had
been sent for ! '

Half Hal's anguish drifted away before
Griselda's composure, as he listened
to her tender voice.

My brave darling,' he said, turning
towards her with passionate admiration, 
my true wife, how I pity all those
poor fellows out there who are fighting
to rescue a lot of frivolous dolls who are
all very well In times of peace ! Oh,
yes, I know some of the women have
behaved wonderfully ! Still  still  there
is only one Griselda in the world ! '

Perhaps there had never been such
perfect accord, or never would be again
In this world, between those two wedded
lovers, hitherto basking In the sunshine
of life, but now suddenly confronted by
a horrible future  as there was to-day
In that little French village. The people
at the Inn fell In love with the young
English couple, especially after the cocker
talked enthusiastically to the landlord
of his jeitJie capitaine, who, his valet

had said, must go with his brothers-harms
to be cut to pieces by the black
devils that Angleterre had been folle
enough to adopt. Madame  a fat good-natured
mother of the night capped brood
of little children, who were jabbering as
they played with stones in the gutter under
the bar-window  made an excuse to eo
into the parlour where the handsome
young monsieur and madame were resting.
This excuse was to propose they
should dine before returning to Paris.
In reality she had never dreamt that
such ' quality ' would accept her homely
fare.

She was astonished when Griselda
looked pleadingly at Hal, and he consented
in a sort of royal bantering way,
as a king out hunting might accept
some peasant's fare. Then afterwards

she stole out and watched them walking
slowly towards the wood.

It was horrible to think of that jeuiie
homme martinique to be killed  chopped
up, the coc/iei had said. And that
sweet petite dame ! I f perchance 

The good woman danced at the little
night - capped heads bobbing about 
sighed, and shook her head.

And Hal and Griselda wandered into
the young woods, he watching the green
lights play upon her soft green velvet
dress and upon her delicate face, with the
sad lino-elinor gaze of one who takes leave
of some beautiful object he may never see:;
again, while Griselda, with her old frankness,
spoke out freely, and tried to coax
Hal to discuss the situation. She coukl
not quite understand his taciturnity
wonder, fcr in speaking of the

journey out, and the perils of the Indian
campaign, she plainly showed that she
intended to be at his side even unto
death.

And he  he dared not take her.

Yet there was still the remote chance
that the brood old  Hal thought of her
now as meddlesome  duchesse might have
surmised wrongly. While his own observation
told him she had not,  he clung
to the forlorn hope that even with her
large experience she had for once made
an error of judgment,  as the drowning
clutch at the straws.

'Hal,' said Griselda at last, 'my love,
I think you joyous temperaments get
dreadful reactions. You are as " down" asa
man can be. Now I, so dull, so quiet
not only feel entirely hopeful, but'  here
she paused, and, raising her eyes to the

sky, her face had a glorified expression
' I feel that although we may have
cruel trials, all will be well at last. Something
tells me so. I seem to hear a voice
that says, "Peace! All is mine." '

Her strong faith influenced Hal. He castoff
his forebodings, and was happy with
the provisional happiness of one who enjoys
a short respite before the inevitable fight.

They wandered about, hand in hand ;
and, to Griselda's delight, they found
some field-flowers, and also a clearing,
with the felled trunks lying here and
there, not so unlike the memorable clearing
at Goarshausen where she and Hal
were lovers for the first time. This led
to talk of those days which to both
seemed ages back in the long past.
Charming talk  those confessions of how
Griselda thought and dreamt of and

longed for Hal, almost without knowing
it ; of how Hal was a very demon with
one idea  Griselda.

You have had such a power over me,
my love, that I believe, if I had to kill
our worst foe over there, and just as I
was about to strike he shouted " Griselda,"
my arm would fall to my side and he
would be spared

Griselda sighed. To her all killing was
murder ; and It would be long before she
could think of her husband as a slayer of
his kind without a shudder.

They had their simple dinner at the
auberge. Then they drove back to Paris,
clinging to each other like children, and,
like children, dreaming so lite of the
coming hideous episodes in their joint
lives that, when they slept, they smiled
unconsciously In their happy dreams.

VOL. III. , K

While Hal and Griselda were wandering
in the woods around Paris, the news
that Captain Romayne  for Hal had his
promotion  was ordered to India with
his regiment, had arrived at Feathers
Court. It seemed such a glorious day,
as if no pain, trouble, or dread could
triumph where nature was rejoicing in
her yearly revelation. The sun shone
on the great stone mansion in the park.
Birds sang loudly in the shrubberies,
heavy white blossoms were struggling
into full bloom on the chestnuts, and a
warm spring wind played with the nodding
tulips in the Italian gardens, and
carried the heavy perfume of hyacinths
into the great drawing-room, where the
long windows were opened to admit the
scented air.

Without, all so fresh, so joyous ; within,

a scene of excited lamentation. Lady
Romayne had resolutely thrust from her
mind all doubts or fears as to Hal's being
sent to India. She had chosen to be an
optimist in regard to the Mutiny. If any
dared to suggest that the evil was deep
rooted, had grown silently but steadily till
it was as a mortal cancer, its branches
reaching from end to end of England's
great dependency, she smiled disdainfully.
Therefore, when terrible accounts of new
uprisings, fresh rebellions of native regiments,
and outrages too atrocious to relate
arrived day after day  her false hopes
fled, and she sank into a nervous, unhinged
state of miserable foreboding.

Then came the deadly blow. Her
adored Hal was summoned. At first she
was as a mad woman, rushing from room
to room, tearing her hair, screaming.

Lydia had to pacify Sir Hubert, who,
in his helpless paralytic state, only half
understood what was going on. Mabel
sent off to Crowsfoot for Doctor Mayne
and Mr Blackett.

John Blackett was deeply impressed
by the news of Hal's summons to the seat
of war. A thoughtful man, he foresaw
greater evils to come before peace could
be restored, a peace bought by the
sacrifice of many promising and noble
lives, by the wreck of many English
homes.

Don't be so lugubrious, man ! ' said
the little Doctor, as he drove his old
friend, the parson, to the Court. ' That
young fellow's pull through safe enough,
and out there he will learn a lesson or
two that'll be a shower bath to any Don
Juan nonsense that may be left m him.

Besides, absence from Griselda will teach
him the value of his jewel.'

But, Griselda ? ' said the Vicar doubtful.
' Do you think for one instant she
will not insist upon sharing his danger ?'

 Blackett ! ' burst out the Doctor. ' Oh,
these philosophers, these extraordinary
thinkers ! Shadow of Swift, all honour
to you for your satire of the Papuans !
Griselda to accompany her husband !
Well, I suppose there is some commonsense
left about somewhere, though this
mismanagement in India wouldn't lead
one to think so.'

The Doctor felt enraged almost for a few
moments after Mr Blackett had spoken,
wondering whether he could have heard
aright. ' Women going out with their
husbands to meet those infuriated hordes,
indeed,' he thought.

'\ tell you what, Blackett he said, kindly
but decidedly, after they had driven into
the park, ' I am a neutral. Nor has
much learnlnor made me mad. If Gris-ella
dreams of going with Hal, I will use
heaven and earth to prevent it, that's all.'

John Blackett was in a meek humour, and

allowed Doctor Mayne to mildly bully him.

 It was well that he was meek, and that

the Doctor effervesced somewhat before

spending a day at Feather's Court. For

if ever two men were harried and worried,

it was they. Not till within an hour of

the expected arrival of Hal and Griselda

did Lady Romayne make any attempt at

self-command, and the house seemed all in

confusion  servants going aimlessly here

and there, the maids collecting in corners

to gossip, and apparently no rooms being

prepared for Mr and Mrs Romayne.

The Doctor came into the great hall
about seven o'clock with an air of relief.
At least, the day was over. John Blackett
was leaning against the hall door, looking
through a side-window. Mabel, in a
white gown, and Lydia, wearing a pretty
dinner-dress, stood silently by.

It is near the time,' said Lydia
mournfully.

Then where is your mother ? ' asked
the Doctor imperiously.

Lydia said she could not possibly
come down, of course. She would see
Hal alone first.

Will she .' ' asked Doctor Mayne,
going off upstairs, agile as a youth.

Doctor Mayne is very impetuous
to-day,' said Lydia dismally. Both girls
stared, when, a few minutes afterwards,
their mother came down the broad staircase,

leaning on his arm. The Doctor
had been impetuous to some purpose.

There Is the carriage,' said Doctor
Mayne. ' Come, come, let us try and
receive the bride and bridegroom as if
we were glad to see them.'

Men-servants drew back the solid
oaken doors. The brougham drove upto
the foot of the wide steps. Its lamps
yellow against the fading crimson of the
sky. Then a lithe active figure sprang
out, waved his hand, helped a lady to
alight, and both came buoyantly up to
the entrance.

The lamplight gleamed upon the two
bright glowing faces. There was an air
of delighted triumph about Hal, as he
lifted Griselda's veil and said, 

Don't kiss her all at once ; ' and no
one, glancing at the young wife, would

have believed that a tinge of sadness
could be veiled by that sweet joyousness
of manner as Griselda embraced
her father, Lady Romaine, and her
sisters-in-law, \vith almost equal ardour.

Mother, I hope dinner is ready ; weare
ferociously hungry  we die of hunger,
as the French say,' said Hal, throwing
aside his travelling-cloak. ' Make haste,
darling ; never mind dressing,' he called
after Griselda, who was going up-stairs
arm in arm with Mabel.

The two had brought an atmosphere
of vivid happy life into lugubrious
Feather's Court. John Blackett smiled,
Doctor Mayne was cheerily sarcastic,
and Lady Romayne felt slightly ashamed
of her undignified abandonment to a
possible grief.

Dinner passed off pleasantly. Hal

was gay, Griselda smiled. * I had no
idea she was so beautiful,' whispered
Mabel to Doctor Mayne.

Nor I, until to-day,' he answered,
in a significant tone. He had not lived
a life of perpetual observation and deduction
therefrom for nothing ; and he
saw that this young couple were meeting
their fate as simply and cheerfully
as all people should  ' only they don't,
or won't,' he added to himself.

Next morning came Important letters,
followed by a special messenger, Hal
was closeted for some time with him
in the library, while Lady Romayne
wandered from the drawing-room to her
boudoir, unable to keep still under this
ordeal to her impatient nature. Lydia
and Mabel went to Griselda's sitting-room,
which commanded a fine view of

the park and the hie hills beyond.
They had heard from their maid that
Marshall, Mrs Romayne's maid, was almost
as much at her wit's end about
starting for India without 'a proper outfit,
which couldn't  do what you mj'ght
be got, all in a hurry  at least for a
lady like Mrs. Romayne,' as about starting
for India at all.

The sisters found Griselda sittings ia
an easy-chair in a delicate grey ,
busy with some lacework.

She looked up with a grave smile as
they entered.

'Why,' Mabel burst out, 'we expected
to find you and Marshall up to
your ears in confections, and here you
are, doing lacework as if you were to
be a fixture, instead of going thousands
and thousands of miles away ! '

Lydia admired the work. Griselda was
transferring some old Brussels sprigs
that had belonged to her mother.

But these honos veils are not worn
now,' Lydia added, half inquiringly, with
a keen glance at her sister-in-law. An
idea had struck her, for quiet Lydia
could observe when she chose. ' I think
I understand the situation,' she thought,
just as Mabel said, 

Whatever are you to do about an
outfit, Griselda ? Of course you have
lots of pretty things. But you don't want
them  you will want woollens, and silk
underlings, and solar topers, whatever
those may be, and white umbrellas  '

We could see to those being sent after
you, dear,' said Lydia. ' Shall we goto
London for you to-day and get enough
things for your journey ? '

Griselda laid aside her work, and,
putting her slender hands on Lydia's
shoulders, looked up into her eyes with
a look which Lydia  who had a heart
beating with a touch of Romayne passion
beneath her quiet exterior  never
forgot. There was a depth of anguish,
appealing love, and desperate patience
she had seen but once before  in the
eyes of a pet spaniel who was struggling
in the agonies of death.

At that moment the door opened, and
Hal came in, pale, agitated. He did
not look at his wife ; but, after a few
commonplaces, he sent his sisters away.

I will come to mother presently,' he
said, as he opened the door for them ;
and they went out, scared and subdued.

He locked and bolted the door, went
to Griselda, and, kneeling down beside

her, encircled her with his arms, his
face hidden upon her shoulder. His
teeth chattered, his whole body trembled
convulsively.

My own,' he said, ' I feel as if I
were dying.'

Griselda soothed and comforted him.
She eave him a cordial that the kind
old duchess had given her at parting,
as a precious secret restorative which
would reanimate when all others failed.
Then she drew a low tabouret to his
side, and said, 

Do not worry about me, darling ! I
know  I guess  you leave to-day. But
I am prepared for it ! Before we left
Paris, I knew that I must not go with
you.'

He started, flushed, then drew her
sweet, blushing face to him and kissed

her. while a passionate prayer went up
from his soul to Heaven that his wild
youth might be forgiven for the sake
of wife  and child.

That night he went, calmly and bravely.
Griselda's hopes had been a consolation
to Lady Romayne, and Mr Blackett
blamed himself for not feeling so sorry
as he ought when Hal drove off in the
brougham, waving his adieux, till the
clump of trees hid the carriage from view.

She will be quite as well without
him,' he thought, as he supported
Griselda to her room, followed by Lady
Romayne, who was struggling for composure.
' There, I believe, he will distinguish
himself and forget his foppishness.
Here he would have sickened of
sweet indolence, and might have fallen
back into his old ways.'

Poor father, with his rdchattffd of
worldly wisdom, with his human arguments,
his human short-sightedness !

For a time all went well at Feather's
Court. Griselda was cheerful. Lady
Romayne was as fussy and devoted to
her Hal's young wife as she had been
to her Hal himself.

I am leading such a white-satin life,'
Griselda told her father one day, when
she was accompanying him through the
shrubberies, ' that I shall be fit for
nothing by-and-by. As for my patience,
that you used to say was my only good
point  don't shake your head, father,
you know you did  there seems nothing
to try it. It will wither and disappear
from actual disuse.'

Wait  wait, my dearest child,' said

the Vicar. He knew how cautiously all
the Indian news was investigated before
Griselda was allowed to see the newspapers,
how many white lies which he
would have scorned to tell were placidly
coined by Lady Romayne in her daughter-in-law's
behalf. Griselda had had but
one letter from Hal, a few lines written
hurriedly on the voyage when they
signalled a vessel homeward bound, 

Darling Wife  Dear Mother,  A
chance to send a line by passing ship.
All well, and as jolly as sand-boys.
Concerts, plays  there are some sharp
fellows in our ranks, I can tell you I
We have had some pretty hot weather ;
but our medico says I stand it splendidly,
and am in glorious trim for wholesale
execution of those 'brigands," as

VOL. III. L

the Parisians call them. Oh, my Gris-ella,

how are you ? Keep happy, for

my sake. And, mother, 1 feel doubly

about you and father  and all  since

well, let Griselda finish the sentence !

Fancy, when I come back to you, covered

with glory, viimis a leg, perhaps, or

with an empty sleeve  but what matters

that ? Colonel, or nothing !  that's mv

war-cry.' (Here came a word black

with ink-erasure). ' Excuse that blotted

word. It was " deuce," I think. The

gong sounded for letters to be handed

in. Ail revoir  au revoir, my own v.'ife

and all dear ones, Hal.'

After this brisk, boyish scribble, ' so
like Hal,' as his woman-kind said, with
Wistful fondness, came blank, unbroken
silence. News had come of the mutiny

at Lucknow, of the recapture of Allahabad.
Horrible, sickening accounts of
the massacres and mutilations of English
mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, had
fired the anger of every British man.
Civilians longed to join their military
brethren in exterminating the human
wild beasts who used their gift of
reason to invent devilries beyond and
above even the hell-torments imagined
by the painter Fra angelico. England's
blood was white-hot in her veins, as
perhaps it had never been,  and, by
God's help,  will never be again.

Then came the awful tale of Cawnpore,
read throughout the land with
pale horror, told with bated breath.
England, that memorable day, seemed
crushed, as if ready to sink into a
merciful sea which would drown her woes.

Lady Romayne read, aghast. But a
sudden spirit seemed to animate her.
Her boy  well, he was doubtless in
danger, and evidently cut off by the
enemy from communication with home.
But in this crisis she must sink ordinary
individual feelings, except her duty ta
her beloved son in protecting his wife
she must be an Englishwoman, calm
and strong in the honourable anger
which sins not.

It was well that she was nerved fora
moral battle, for a few minutes after
her maid came to say, as she handed
her a twisted note, 

The Doctor and Mr Blackett, my
lady, in Sir Hubert's office; they came
quite quiet-like through the stable-yard.'

How those common words brought
death to her forlorn hope, stabbed her

heart! She seemed to feel her life
stop, halt.

She staggered. Her maid, alarmed,
got her some sal-volatile. She drank
it. Then she went quickly down the
back-stair, and into the office Sir Hubert
used before he had his paralytic
stroke.

John Blackett and Doctor Mayne stood
near the window.

I have not read your letter, gentlemen,'
she said, almost defiantly, ' because
I know  my son is dead ! '

She had spoken more than she really
believed, in a sort of delirious agony.
What was this ? Both men were silent
Mr Blackett's head hung upon his
breast  Doctor Mayne took a step
forward.

Too late ! With a smothered cry, the

unhappy mother threw up her arms,
then fell backwards on the polished
flooring, as one dead  by Heaven's
mercy, rejoining her best-beloved child,
her lost Hal.

Doctor MAYNE and Mr

Blackett assisted Lady Romayne
to poor Sir Hubert's
great arm-chair, where he used to sit so
often building castles in the air of a great
future for his eldest born. How little
had he dreamt that one day, so soon,
his bereaved wife would lie there, insensible
with grief at the news that
brave, handsome Hal was dead, killed,
perhaps massacred, in India !

Lady Romayne's maid had followed her
mistress, and fetched restoratives so quietly,

that the household little thought what
news the old postman had brought in the
Feather's Court post-bag.

The unhappy mother's first cry was 
How  oh, when  was it?' Doctor
Mayne looked at Mr Blackett.

We have the news direct from General
Grayburgh,' the Vicar said, taking her
trembling hand kindly between his ; ' the
General wrote under cover to me. Mayne,
the letters, please.'

Doctor Mayne produced one of those
mysterious leathern instrument-cases which
his young patients held in such awe, and
handed Lady Romayne a letter.

She shrunk back, crying, ' No  no  
I can't see ; read it.' She could not face
the awful news ; she covered her face
with her hands.

John Blackett read, in a faltering voice,

which sounded tragical in the dead silence,
as the doctor and the maid stood by as
mourners stand by a grave : 

India, July  ///, '57.
My dear, good Lady Romayne,  Be
Worthy of that fine fellow, your son Hal,
who has yielded his life for his country
as a soldier should. I am writing to the
mother of a hero, so I need not mince
matters. Captain Romayne, after being
slightly wounded in a skirmish, volunteered
to go to the relief of Colonel S  ,
who was to have arrived here ten days
since, and about whom we had grave
misgivings. After a few days, a scout
arrived with the terrible intelligence that
Colonel S  had been beaten back into
a native fortress, and that the reinforcement
sent to his aid had been cut to
pieces by the rebels. The scout had

seen the remains of Captain Romaynes
company, and they arrived here yesterday
with full accounts of the catastrophe.
They were surprised in camp,
at night, and overpowered. The account
of the massacre is one on the long list
which daily increases, and almost each
hour princes news to add to it. I will
write again, and on our return, which can
scarcely be yet a while, I hope to find
that the Almighty has mercifully consoled
the good mother and the dear young
widow of one of the most daring and
brave young officers England has ever
lost.  I am, yours most faithfully,

Thomas Grayburgh
(General in Command, etc.)

Pes.  I have your son's watch and
chain, also a ring recognised as his, found

upon a Sepoy shot later on by our returning

men.

That letter had been written by the
good old General with a full heart. It
was read and heard in Sir Hubert's
little study at Feather's Court with a
grief too deep for tears.

All but one word was listened to by
Lady Romayne with a sort of incredulous
stupor ; and at that word ' widow,' she
started ; the truth came home to her.

As John Blackett read the General's
message, the afterthought of poor Hal's
watch and ring, she burst into passionate
sobs.

Poor soul ! Let her cry,' said Doctor
Mayne, almost desperately. Then going
away to the window, he gazed out into the
gardens, brilliant in the steady August

sunshine, and, while he unconsciously
rattled the money in his pockets  a trick
of his when he felt beaten by the skeleton
Death  he thought back upon many bad
half-hours, among them that Christmas Eve
when Griselda was born in the snow, and
that cruel summer night when Hal was
supposed killed in the railway accident.

But this beats all ! ' he thought. ' Here
Blackett and I have barely begun the
wretched business. There's Griselda to
be told ; then we know pretty well what
will follow that  '

Here he turned, arrested by the word
 Griselda.'

Lady Romayne, with a vague feeling
she must not be unworthy of her brave,
dead son, had controlled her sobs, and,
rising with Mr Blackett's support, said
brokenly, but eloquently, 

Griselda  our  Griselda.'

Doctor Mayne, re-animated by this attempt
at self-control, came briskly forward.

John Blackett proposed to break the
news to his child himself.

No, no, that will never do,' said the
Doctor, who fully appreciated Blackett,
but thought him deficient In tact. ' Remember
that Griselda Is my patient, and,
that we have such an ugly business before
us  dangerous, too  that we want
all our wits together to soften the shock.'

Then he proposed that Marshall, Grls-
ella's maid, should go to awaken her as
usual, and that, when she had breakfasted
and dressed. Doctor Mayne should fetch
her, ostensibly for a consultation as to
whether Mr Blackett, or Blunt, or someone,
should go out to Hal, who was dangerously
wounded.

John Blackett's face fell.

I hate lies,' he said ; * better the blow
better anything, than a lie ! ' He might
well feel thus  he, whose life had been
shrouded, banned, by the suppression of
truth !

She will guess it,' said Doctor Maine
bluntly  'that's one comfort.' Doctor-like,
his principal interest lay with his
patient, who was, as it were, to undergo
torture while his fingers pressed her pulse.
Now I'll go off and find the maid 
what's her name ?  Marshall, and coach
her up.'

Going into the servants' quarters, the
gentle clatter of breakfast preparation,
the sound of cheerful voices and laughter,
the Dutch picture, framed by the open
kitchen door, of glowing fire and bright
ranges of red copper and white tin, also

the savoury odours of peppery dishes,
dominated by coffee,  struck him as incongruous.


'Life and death elbow each other with
a vengeance on this incomprehensible
little globe,' he thought, as he paced the
stone passage, waiting for Marshall.

Marshall, a neat girl, with shining dark
hair, came out of the still-room with Mrs
Romayne's breakfast-tray'.

Go and put that down, there's a good
girl, and come here,' said Doctor Mayne.

Time pressed and would not admit of
ceremony.

Marshall did as she was told, and returned.


 There is bad news from India,' said
the Doctor, in an undertone: 'and your
mistress's life depends upon your discretion,
mv discretion  in fact, an incautious

word or look from anyone may spot!
everything.'

Marshall paled, but looked steadily at
Doctor Mayne.

I suppose the Captain is wounded
sir.'

Worse than that  the very worst ! '

Captain Romayne is not dead, sir ?
if you mean that,' said the girl calmly.
At least I cannot believe it, and I know
that Mrs Romayne will not.'

The Doctor stared. Was the girl
daft? He hastened to tell her the bad
news in detail. But she shook her
head.

I will tell you why I can't think
but that there is some mistake, sir,' she
went on. 'It is because Mrs Romayne
is so set upon it that, whatever may
happen to the Captain, he will get over

it. She has read all the most horrible
things, and she has told me of them.
But she always said at the end, with a
smile, " Ought I not to be thankful,
Marshall, that Captain Romayne will be
spared to me?" It used to make me
feel uncanny-like at first. But now
I've come to believe in it, just as
Mrs Romayne does herself.'

It was on the Doctor's lips to say,
You and Mrs Romayne are a couple
of idiots.' However he repressed the
speech, and lectured Marshall as to her
conduct. She said, ' You may depend
on me, sir,' and went upstairs with
her tray, as composedly as if nothing
had happened.

Curious,' thought the Doctor, looking
after her, and stroking his chin,  ' very
curious ! ' Then he went off to find

VOL. III. M

'the girls,' who ought to be told, or
rather prepared for their brother's loss
wondering, as he went, at the mysteries
of people's influence over one
another. ' The maternity influences Gris-ella,
and Griselda influences that girl,'
he told himself. Still, he had an uncomfortable
sensation of unreality. ' After
all, what if there were a possibility of
Hal's'

No, no! It would not do to start
forlorn hopes. As soon as he had told
the girls who seemed too crushed and
stunned to be either help or hindrance 
he went to Griselda's room and knocked.

She was orivintr some orders to Marshall,
but turned a pale grave face towards
the Doctor.

She suspects ! ' he thought. ' She
must know that the mail is in.'

She held out her hand silently. ' Good-morning,
Doctor,' she said. ' Who  who
is the patient ?'

He reddened under her scrutinising
gaze. Somehow, he felt as if in the
presence of a superior power that had
rebuked him for daring to take matters
into his own hands.

Lady Romayne is not very well this
morning. She has sent me to ask you
to come to see her in the drawing-room.'
The Doctor spoke kindly, but
not with his usual confidence.

In one moment.'

Griselda went into the adjoining room.
It was Kal's , dressing-room. After his
departure, she had locked it, and kept
the key in her pocket. The room was
as he had left it, the coat he had last
worn thrown aside, papers strewing the

floor, a hat lying where it had fallen,
trifles he had not taken standing about
on the chest of drawers and mantelpiece,
some cigar-ash in a tray on his writing-table,
torn letters in the waste - paper
basket, a glove, and a light bedroom
chair fallen aside where he had last
taken her in his arms for that passionate
parting embrace.

This room was her chapel, where she
prayed  had prayed with such prayers
that Heaven seemed to open and cast
down a pitiful * Yea ' upon her soul
before it fell in prostrate agonising craving
that all  all  might be taken from her,
except  except her  Hal's life.

As she stood there now, she pressed
her temples tightly with her fingers.
There is bad news,' she slowly thought 
bad news ; they  think  he  is  dead ! '

Then a sudden horror of the possibility
overwhelmed her, and her soul
seemed to leap up, imploring, begging
a sign from the Almighty Power.

One instant of agony  then it was
as if a flood of joy was let loose, and
as if everything  the very atoms in the
air, the inanimate objects around, the
living Nature without, basking in the
sun, joined in one great 'No!'

The effect was overpowering. She
almost believed that the shout must
have burst upon all ears like a thunderclap.


Thank God ! ' was her fervent prayer.
In danger  in many dangers he maybe,
but not  not dead!'

Doctor Mayne, waiting with impatient
eyes fixed upon the clock, saw her
coming quietly out, with a happy sunshiny

smile playing about her lips, 
and mentally groaned.

She does not suspect,' he thought
in dismay, as he followed her downstairs.
' What's to be done now ?
Another scene  two of them this time.
That unfortunate boy was always upsetting
everything when he was alive,
and it doesn't seem to be much better
now it's all over with him.'

He closed the drawing-room door after
they had entered, almost in despair,
thinking with professional feeling that
this sort of thing must kill somebody ;
and he had hoped to save all parties
concerned at Feather's Court.

And Griselda ? The instant she saw
her father standing gloomily on the
hearth-rug near to Lady Romayne, who
was pale, and who crouched upon,

rather than sat on, a couch near, her
head averted  she knew what had happened.


She went quickly to Lady Romayne,
knelt by her, took her hand, and affectionately
kissing it said, 

Mother, darling, the mail is a bad one,
I fear.'

Lady Romayne convulsively clasped
the young widow's hands, and choked.
She felt bursting, her lips trembled, her
face twitched.

Father, I must know all about it,
please,' said Griselda firmly, putting her
arm protecting round her Hal's mother,
and looking  almost sternly at John
Blackett with her clear candid eyes. ' I
know you meant it kindly ; but, if any
newspapers or letters came likely to
shock mother, I was the proper person

to have been told first, that I might
prepare her.'

Doctor Mayne scratched his head, incapable
of thought. John Blackett stared
first at his daughter, puzzled, bewildered,
then at Doctor Mayne, whose eyes looked
dull as with an opiate,  then at Lady
Romayne.

Tell her,' said she brokenly. * Oh,
my poor darling ! '

 We have had our bad news direct
from General Grayburgh,' said her father
firmly.

The letter, please, ' was Griselda's
reply, stretching out one hand.

Oh, no, no, ' sobbed Lady Romayne,
clasping Griselda closer.

Griselda half-smiled, whispered some
tender endearing words, and repeated her
demand.

Her father glanced at Doctor Mayne.

You must use your own judgment
said the Httle Doctor, walking away.

John Blackett handed General Gray-burgh's
letter to his child. Still kneeling,
still embracing Lady Romayne, she read
it  twice  thrice.

'Is this all?' she asked. 'This poor,
good, old man has lied  unconsciously 
but this news of his is a lie.'

My child  think  there is more, perhaps
 do not have false hopes,' began
John Blackett.

'Hush, hush!' said Doctor Mayne,
briskly returning, having consulted with
himself, and decided that this strange attitude
of Griselda's was the work of
Nature, who works miracles to protect
the young, and must be helped rather
than discouraged. * Mrs Romayne is

quite right. After all, what are the
proofs ? '

Lady Romayne shuddered.

There are none,' said Griselda, ' And,,
even if there were, I should not believe
Hal dead. He may be ill, suffering, in
danger  but not dead. That letter is a
message to me  I am to go to him.'

John Blackett gazed miserably at his
daughter. Had the idea of her husband's
death disorganised her brain ?

Humour her  it is the best things
to do, ' whispered Doctor Mayne. He
thought this mood was a prelude to
sudden illness.

But Griselda maintained her position
defended her opinion, not only that day,
but the days that followed. And while
Feather's Court was silent as a tomb, and
tears were shed openly and in secret

while mourning was talked of, and the
next occurrence expected was the arrival
of a milliner to superintend the horrors
of crape and the rest of the panoply of
woe, Griselda and her maid were busy
packing to start for India.

When it was discovered that Mrs Romayne
had taken berths in the next P.
& O. steamer for herself and her faithful
Marshall, there was a battle of words at
Feather's Court.

It was suddenly discovered that, in
point of fact, no one could actually prevent
Griselda from executing her wild
notion.

< She was legally a free agent, at liberty
to go or to stay when and how she chose.

Legally, but not morally,' said John
Blackett tenderly, but firmly, to his
daughter, who was to him a sudden problem

he could not solve. He talked,
argued, warned  all went for nothing.

Lady Romayne feared she was mad.

*What to do I don't know,' she said,
distractedly. ' No one seems to do anything,
and, if we do not keep her by force,
she will carry out her suicidal mania, for
that's what it is.'

Hal was dead  yet they knew no date,
they could not openly assert his death asa
certainty, and the official reports merely
mentioned him as killed in a sortie.

I'll tell you what to do,' Doctor Mayne
said, on the eve of Griselda's wild journey.
' Humour her. Take her yourself,
Blackett. This is merely a flash in the
pan. If I am not greatly mistaken, she will
not be well enough to start. If she starts,
she will either be ill on board, or you will
have to go on shore and remain there at

Gib or Valetta. We must prepare for
the worst, but hope for the best. She is
her mother's daughter with a vengeance !
Only her mother dared the snow to help
a fellow-creature, and she is going literally
through the fire, to what ? To a dead
husband ! '

As it seemed impossible to bring Gris-ella
to reason, John Blackett designed to
escort his daughter and her maid himself.

It was a sultry, rainy day as the three
left Feather's Court. Lady Romayne was
prostrate with nervous weakness in her
darkened room. The girls seemed scared.
The household generally was wrapped in
gloom, from Sir Hubert, who was more
fretful than usual, down to the dogs, who
lay in corners with limp tails, only noticing
the preparations for the departure by lazily
opening their dulled eyes as the servants

went to and fro. When Griselda kissed
her sisters-in-law and hurried to the carriage,
one old hound rose, stretched himself,
yawned, and, coming to the door,
sniffed, and with one half-disdainful look
after the carriage, retired to his mat.
There was an atmosphere of unbelief in
anything but the dullest misery, that
Griselda had keenly felt those days of
preparation  and, looking back at Feather's
Court, as they drove through the great
park gates, she clasped her hands, and
said, with a new passion unlike her old
self,

sat last at last thank God! The
moments have seemed days  it seems
countless ages since that morning when
you all began to persist that he was dead ! '

Her father sighed. Marshall, who was
a little excited, starting to ' rush into the

massacre, ' as the butler, who hoped
eventually to marry her, had termed it,
looked eloquently at her mistress. John
Blackett glanced out at the dull rainy
landscape, and sighed.

But the strong faith, hope, love, that
burned as a fierce fire in Griselda's soul, influenced
John Blackett in spite of himself.

Once fairly started on her quest, Gris-ella
was active, hopeful, even cheerful.
She showed no trace of fatigue during
the harassing day in London, followed by
the railway journey. Once on board, she
retired to her cabin and slept like an
infant. Her father grew anxious as day
followed day, as they touched at landing-stages
and steamed away again, and the
chances of the stoppage of Griselda's
pilgrimage grew less and less. Both she
and her maid seemed impervious to

changes of climate, to storms, raging seas,
parching heat, scorching sun.

It is just as if they had charmed Hves/
the Vicar thought, as he paced the deck
at night, taking his first long gaze at the
much-vaunted and disappointing constellation,
the Southern Cross. Then he meditated
on the strangeness of the fact, that
sometimes the weakest creatures brave
dangers to which the strongest succumb.
He felt uneasy now about himself. The
ship's surgeon had shaken his head when
he detailed his unpleasant symptoms to
him. The journey which had barely tired
Griselda and her maid had seriously
affected him. His temperature was high,
his pulse raced, he could neither eat nor
sleep. At Bombay he was stricken with
fever, and Griselda had to leave him
there with an English clergyman, an old

college-friend, and to pursue her journey
alone.

It was a cruel journey. But the small
band of native servants engaged for herby
her father's friends were faithful
through all dangers, except one.

The dangers were many. The mutiny
was now so firmly established, and so
cleverly hidden by Indian subtlety, that
proffers of help had to be discarded
throughout, lest the seeming courtesy
should veil the deadliest enmity. They
travelled mostly by night, Griselda In
one litter, or palanquin, her maid in another.
By day they rested In the shade,
or in a dak-bungalow, a small house for
travellers, where they may break their
journey for a while. They suffered from
heat, although the cool season was just
beginning. They met with dust-storms

VOL. III. N

storms that rage with fury, bending
and breaking trees, rooting up the great-leased
plants and carrying them miles, while
the darkness rivals that of the blackest
night. They ran the gauntlet of burning
visages, of bands of infuriated Sepoy,
armed with weapons that were red with
British blood. One servant was bitten
by a poisonous snake, and was left dying
at the hut of a friendly native. But until
a certain night in the jungle, when the
worst danger occurred, the servants were
staunch and brave in the cause of the
gentle 'mem-sahib,' whose wonderful journeying,
in her state, inspired them with
a superstitious reverence.

This night all seemed ofoino- on as usual;
Griselda, hushed by a peculiar chant of
the men who carried her litter, was dreamily
gazing at the beautiful scene she was

travelling through ; at the torchlight flickering
upon the rugged stems of the giant
palms, and the graceful festoons of flowering
creepers flung gracefully from tree to
tree ; was dreamily inhaling the warm
aromatic perfume of the moist, soft earth,
when her couch was suddenly let down
she heard wild yells, then found herself
in the dark, alone  but not for more thana
minute. She heard crashing and
crunching in the jungle, then some heavy
weight seemed swung over the thin roof
of the litter, and, with a roar which was
loud as thunder close overhead, a gigantic
tiger flunof himself across into the thick
vegetation, and disappeared.

For a moment she felt stunned. Then
she saw bobbing lights, and the terrified
servants flocked back, salaaming and chattering
excuses. They professed that they

knew the man-eater would fear the
mem-sahib, but would kill them. Thus
they saved themselves by leaving her
to conquer him by her divine power.

After this, what next ? ' wondered
Griselda. She was soon to know.

The very morning after, they came
upon the brow of a hill ; and, with a full
heart, but without fear or evil anticipation,
she saw her destination  a fortress,
a white Oriental pile, pure white in the
early morning air. A long low wall
above the shining river was surmounted
by battlements and projecting bastions.
Above, the red wall of the fort was
crowned with lofty towers and with pavilions
of white marble, the cupolas of
which seemed of burnished gold. la
this dream of a building, this sudden
embodiment of reminiscences of arabian

tales, Griselda was to learn her
fate.

Staunchly she bore up during the tedious
progress to General Grayburgh's
quarters. Her little band passed the
outer walls, the many courtyards and
groups of buildings which made the fortress
almost a city in itself, and passed
a great but gloomy palace of dark redstone,
into a square surrounded by turreted
pavilions of marble, the columns
and walls inlaid with precious stones.

Here the procession halted at a doorway
in a marble screen. Griselda's bearer
or chief servant of a superior caste 
was just assisting her to alight, when a
young officer in a shabby uniform, with
his arm in a sling, came out, and stood
still, staring at her in stupefied astonishment.


Griselda at once recognised the original
of a photograph in one of her husband's
albums. This worn, tattered-looking being
was a brother officer of Hal's.

I am Mrs Romayne,' she said hurriedly.
' Pray let me see General Gray-burgh
at once.'

Oh,' said the young man, in an indescribable
tone of mingled wonder, sympathy,
horror, and perplexity. He had
snatched off his cap with his left hand,
and stood nervously twitching the fringe
of his puggaree.

The General ' ' he repeated stupidly,
Of course ; I beg your pardon. I will
see.'

He returned into the cool, dark stone
chamber Griselda saw beyond the doorway.
She stepped to the door, and wondered,
with a dazed feeling, how she was

here. Was it all a dream ? It seemed
but yesterday she was in Feather's Court,
standing in Hal's dressing-room, importuning
Heaven for a sign that her darling
lived. And now she was standing where
he had stood, breathing the hot air he
had breathed, gazing on a strange Eastern
scene familiar to his eyes.

Footsteps, and the lieutenant came
along a passage.

If you will be so good as to come this
way, the General will see you,' he said.
He looked solemn, the tone of his
voice sounded ominous to the faithful
wife.

Still she followed him bravely along a
narrow passage barely lighted by oblong
holes in the thick walls, and stepped
beyond a curtain he lifted respectfully,
standing aside. She found herself in a

darkened chamber, with stone walls, Inlaid
flooring, and a high vaulted roof. At a
rough office table sat General Grayburgh,
leaning his head on his hand.

He came silently towards her, and led
her to a seat. He was frightfully changed.
Thin, haggard, with great bloodshot eyes,
that were like those of a starved, hunted
animal.

Poor, poor child ! ' he stammered, taking
one of her hands in both his trembling
ones. ' And you have come all
this way  '

To find my husband. I cannot but
believe that he is still alive,' said Griselda
boldly, her superhuman courage and
strength reasserting itself. ' Tell me  he
is not dead ! '

Then '  the General looked at her
with a stare that had a ferocity of grief

in Its wildness. It seemed to Griselda as
if he hardly knew her  as if his senses
left him then and there.

He staggered back, almost fell on the'
rough chair, and hiding his face, he
sobbed  hard, dry sobs.

M

T was a minute of fearful suspense,
that spent by Griselda
in the dimly-lit, solemn stone
chamber in the Indian fortress, while the
evidently broken-down old man, General
Grayburgh, struggled to overcome his
emotion.

Watching a ray of yellow light that
fell upon his head through the dulled
glass lozenges in a high window, upon
the dishevelled grey hair that told tales
of the neglect born of acute personal
suffering, she still hoped.

This could not be merely the grief for
lost comrades. There was a passion in
it  an agony.

Quick as thought, she went across
the slippery inlaid floor to the rough
writing-table which had been knocked
together for the General when he took
up his abode in this, the palace occupied
by generation after generation of native
princes,  and laid her hand lightly on
his arm. His chest moved less convulsively
now. He raised his miserable,
haggard face.

Do you know  all ? ' he asked, fixing
his eyes scrutinizingly upon her.

He is alive  tell me that he is alive ! '
cried Griselda, in a sudden fury of hope,
fear, kneeling down and grasping his
knee.

Yes  yes,' said the General, with

seeming astonishment. * Of course ! I
wrote it to you  that first letter was a
mistake.'

You only wrote he was dead she
cried, tears of joy streaming down her
face. ' Say it again. What does anything
matter now ? Oh thank God !
thank God ! '

The General looked with infinite pity
at the faithful loving wife who had dared
death in its cruellest form to join her
husband, if only his mutilated remains
in the grave ; then he gently assisted
her to rise, placed her in his chair,
fetched a curious old flagon and chased
silver goblet from a marble bracket that
jutted out from the wall, and said, 

Drink a little, my child ; it will do
you good.'

The iced concoction of champagne and

sparkling water which the General's ,
or native butler, had but just
brought from a deep cellar as Griselda
arrived, revived her. She looked

anxiously at the old man as she drank.
He was pacing the chamber, his hands
behind him, as if mentally revolving some
desperate battle or final sortie. He was
really at his wits' end how much or how
little to tell this young wife  who was so
soon to pass the threshold of motherhood
of what had befallen her husband.

You are a good, brave girl, are you
not ? ' he said abruptly at last, dashing
into the subject. ' But, of course, you
have proved it. Well, my first letter
was gospel truth to me when I wrote it.
We seemed to have conclusive evidence
that Romayne was  well, that all was
over with him. Two of his troop had

seen him cut down ; another said  ' He
stopped short. ' However, it is all right
now ; so I will not harrow you with
horrible details. Then they found one of
the rebels with his watch and ring, and
another wearing his uniform. But ' 
here the General paused, and, as a deep
red flush rose to his brow, he stammered
and went on hurriedly,  ' Lady Hermione,
who was with me, would not believe it.
You are aware she had known your
husband's family a long time. She 
she organised a search-party, and a few
days later I heard that, although he was
desperately wounded. there were hopes
of his recovery.'

Oh, where  where is he ? Let me
go to him ! ' implored Griselda.

He is not here,' said the General.
He Is  some miles off In a village which

is fortunately friendly to us. He Is In
one of the best bungalows  the residence
of a Government engineer, who luckily
sent his family home at the very beginning
of the Mutiny.'

But the last news ? '

The General was silent, thought for
moment, then said, 

Colonel Stone has the latest news,
I think. If you will wait here a few
minutes, I will step across the square to
his quarters and he shall come to you.'

Griselda was as mentally dazzled by
this great joy Into which she was suddenly
plunged after the strain she had
almost miraculously undergone, as a blind
man who regains his sight In the broad
daylight. She could hardly bear the
certainty that Hal lived, without some
outbreak of violent emotion. The Idea

that there was something sinister hidden
that she had yet to learn did not occur
to her. With trembling voice she expressed
her gratitude. Of course she
would be only too thankful to see Colonel
Stone  she had heard his name often
from her dear husband's lips. Then she
asked if her maid, who was waiting without,
might come to her.

Certainly,' said the General, going
off drearily.

Presently, In rushed Marshall ; and
in the two women's relief and joy the
positions of mistress and maid were forgotten.
Like sisters they embraced, and
wept, and uttered incoherent exclamations
of gratitude for safety, for peace.

The General, in his white helmet, his
hands thrust Into his pockets, skirted
the sunlit court, and, turning his tired

eyes away from the blinding glare of the

marble pavement, reached the doorway

in the wall. Passion under the magnificent

balcony, above which was a mass

of raised carvings in precious marbles, he

mounted a narrow stairway, and gained

a tower where Colonel Stone lived with

his wife and three children. Exterminate

first room, which, in spite of the

moistened parties, or grass blinds, was

hot and close,  he found the Colonel

seated on the floor, fanning his eldest

little daughter, who lay with her head

on his knee, her pale face thrown back.

Fever ? ' said the General sympathetically.


The Colonel nodded, and pointed to
a chair close by. In these days of trials,
deprivation, and suffering of every sort,
etiquette gave place to the dictates of

VOL. III. o

stricken hearts. There was scant ceremony,
and but Httle talk. Men spoke
by looks and by gestures, which were
only too eloquent, only too suggestive
of a great common woe.

The two officers talked in whispers.

The General told Griselda's tale in a
few words.

Colonel Stone, a grey-haired but still
young man, was the General's staunch
adherent and old attached friend. He
had been present at the late terrible
crisis of General Grayburgh's life, which
occurred shortly after the letter was
written and despatched containing the
announcement of the death of Captain
Romayne. Lady Hermione, who had
accompanied the regiment throughout,
had been much with Captain Romayne.
If she had petted him formerly, she

simply devoted herself entirely to him
now ; and he felt the old affection reviving:.
While he was fiorhtinof against
the rebels, he was succambino to a
deadly moral poison ; he went into battle
enervated and hopeless. He told himself
that his desperate feats were despair,
and that he had the luck of those
unfortunate in love. On the very eve
of that fateful skirmish he had been betrayed
into acknowledging to his Circe
that he was won back, that she was
victress, and for the future it would be
Hermione, not Griselda ; but a desperate
revulsion of feeling, when he found
General Grayburgh overwhelmed with
anxiety as to the fate of Colonel Solly,
led him to insist on oroine to the rescue
with a troop of picked men. He left
without a word or a message to Lady

Hermlone, and when he was cut down
and slashed, when he saw an infuriated
Sepoy raising his arm to deal the fatal
blow, he resigned his soul to God with
a great thankfulness that he was spared
saved, blessed.

Lady Hermione., after days of abject
misery alternating with passionate love
and rage,  as only such a woman in such
a position can know,  saw the returning
remnant of Hal's company, and, on hearing
the news of his death, rushed madly
into her husband's office, where he was
closeted with Colonel Stone ; and then
ensued a scene which mentally shattered
General Grayburgh, and filled the domesticated,
gentle Colonel, who had been
a good son to a widowed mother, and
who was a loving father and devoted
husband, with distress. Lady Hermione

flung herself about the room, upbraiding
her husband for having sent the only
being she loved to his death, confessing
their honos mutual love, and her hatred
of the General in that she was doomed
to be his wife. It was worse than a
death - blow to the kind old man ; and
Ashen, after Lady Hermione had started
to find Hal, or his corpse, Colonel Stone
attempted to soothe him by suggestions
that women will confess any imaginary
sin and wickedness in a sudden access
of hysteria, he merely shook his head
and said, 

I ask only one favour of you, Stone ;
never mention her to me again ! '

Colonel Stone did as he was asked.
But now it was the General who entered
upon the subject himself.

After the story of Griseldas journey

and arrival, there was a pause  then the
General forced himself to say, 

Stone, you are experienced  married,
I mean  you have a real wife ; tell me
what to do ? '

I must think,' said the Colonel.

Then there was silence in the hot
room, broken only by the tramp of the
sentry on the ramparts below, by the
moaning of the sick child, by a subdued
singing in the next room, as Mrs Stone
hushed her delicate young infant, born
since the regiment had occupied the
fortress.

After a minute's pause. Colonel Stone
said slowly, 

General, you have recurred to the
painful subject I gave you my word not
to allude to. I am glad you have given
me the opportunity to repeat emphatically

that on that occasion your wife was,
in my opinion, temporarily mad. There
may have' been some sentiment  women
will have their sentiments, especially about
young fellows half their age  but, as I
live, I firmly believe that all else but
the bare sentiment was delirious raving.
I am told that Lady Hermione has not
seen Romayne since he became conscious.*

The General sighed; a dark look passed
across his face.

What I wanted you to decide is
this,' he said. ' What is to be done
with this poor unfortunate girl in her
state ? Dare I let her go to that iniquitous
house, to a man who has been false
to his marriage vows ? Oh, don't interrupt
! Don't defend them ! I asked your
advice for this good faithful wife, not fora
traitress.'

' Let her go at once  to-day,' said
Colonel Stone, emphatically. ' Meanwhile,
let us make her as welcome as
we can. She must be an extraordinary
woman ! "

She is,' said the General, warmly.
'If all were like her, England would
abound with heroes, and hold her own
against the world. It is the mothers that
make the sons, the wives the husbands.'

But perhaps it might be said by
women, that they are what we make
them,' suggested the Colonel, meekly.

Then he called, and an ayah came
and took his place. He kissed his poor
little daughter, and went down and
across the court to the General's rooms.
Griselda rose and welcomed him ashe
entered. The Colonel was taken
aback as he saw this beautiful fair

creature, who had as it were dropped
from the clouds, radiant with blessedness.
What a cruel shame it would be,
he thought indignantly, if the General
were right, and Hal Romayne was 
yes, there was only one word that
fitted  a blackguard !

He bowed with the deepest respect
over Mrs Romayne's extended hand.

It seems as if the ae of miracles
had returned,' he said admiringly. ' To
think of your traversing this wretched
country, going through those crowds
of demons unharmed  it is a miracle!
Heaven grant you have brought a
blessing with you ! We are sadly forlorn
 God-forsaken  here. '

Then he told her how they had
suffered from want of food, want of
the most ordinary comforts  how they

had been parched with thirst, and how
the children had died of fever, so that
scarcely a day passed but there was a
burial In the mosque without the fort
which was used for Christian services.

 But we shall be able to take care
of you till evening,' he said cheerily,
I will go at once and see about It
Then I will accompany you to the
bungalow where your husband Is, I am
thankful to say, slowly recovering.'

He went away, wondering. After
this journey of Griselda's, he felt he
should never despair, never think the
wildest Idea unreasonable.

He borrowed an ayah from the widow
of a major lately killed, whose grief
had but enhanced her natural sympathies.
He had mattresses placed for
Griselda and her maid In the stone

chamber which the General willingly
resigned to the travellers.

Griselda slept heavily, dreamlessly, and
awoke in the late afternoon to see dusky
forms in strange dresses flitting about
in the half-lifht  her servants, brineinof
in dinner. After she and Marshall had
eaten, the General and Colonel Stone
came in ; and presently the little procession,
that had astonished the officers
by its unexpected arrival in the early
morning, left the gates,  watched and
saluted by many who had heard the
story of its brave progress, unscathed,
through untold dangers.

The Colonel walked by Griselda's
litter down the uneven road. Arrived
at the foot of the slope, they proceeded
along the river bank. To their right
towered the grand white pile of Oriental

buildings, the gilded cupolas glistening
in the setting sun  to the left, the
wooded hills above the blood red river
were already in the shadow. Long before
they reached the outlying cantonment
which skirted the native village,
the golden and crimson tints had faded
to dull yellow and pink. Then came a
luminous twilight, in which white objects
seemed brilliant, faces paled, and the
lights they were approaching were glowing
red specks, dazzling as fireflies.
Strange insects buzzed : frosts croaked
in their damp retreats. Then came a
road bordered by scattered bungalows
in their compounds, or rather square
buildings, with verandahs of different
sizes, standing in plots of ground more
or less cultivated, divided from each
other by mud walls or hedges of shrubs.

One of these was more pretentious
than the rest. Graceful trees were
planted to screen the compound from
the road. Two stood as dark sentinels
in the rising moonlight, guarding the
white posts of the open entrance to the
carriage-drive.

Here the Colonel gave the word to
halt.

After the noise of the footsteps had
subsided, they heard faint sounds of
music. Griselda listened, astonished.
Music, here  now ? She held out her
hand silently to the Colonel, alighted,
and listened.

Then she bent her head ; some one
was playing softly, sweetly, sadly, a
favourite sacred song of hers  the holy,
placid melody of Mendelssohn's, known
as ' Ye hills and vales.'

While she was thrilled with emotion,
the Colonel, who was absolutely unmusical,
was angered, disappointed. To
him that music meant fresh entanglement
between the unhappy young officer
and his general's unscrupulous wife.

You had better let me o-q first and
announce you,' he suggested to Griselda,
repressing his indignation.

No, no,' said she. ' Do not think
me ungrateful,' she went on pleadingly
' indeed I shall never forget your kindness
; but  I- feel  I know  it is better
I should go alone.'

The Colonel hesitated a moment. The
idea of the unsuspecting young wife
finding a species of deputy installed
under her husband's roof, shocked him.

I think  indeed I am sure  now I
have heard the music, that Lady Her-mine

Grayburgh is still there. She
found him, you know, and I am told
that he in a great measure owes his life
to her and her maid's nursing.'

He put it as neatly as he could. He
saw a strange smile come upon Griselda's
face, which looked unearthly in the
moonlight ; it reminded him of some
picture he had seen  an angel bearing
a little child to heaven.

I know Lady Hermione,' said Gris-ella
simply. "Colonel Stone, I think
people sometimes can talk better to each
other quite by themselves. You don't
mind?' she added apologetically.

Good heavens, no ! ' exclaimed the
Colonel, started into involuntary energy.
Then, after some conversation as to
what it would be best to do about
the servants, et caetera, he took leave

Griselda.

of Mrs Romayne with the deepest
respect.

She suspects, or knows,' he thought
as he made his way back to the fortress
in the moonlight, ' and behaves Hke a
true unselfish woman. She is a lesson
to any man. What hope ! what faith ! '

'-

RISELDA left her party, and
walked up the drive to the
bungalow alone. The moonlight
showed the graceful Indian corn,
the groves of strange dream-like plants,
in their full beauty of form without
colour. For paths, grass, trees, plants,
and bungalow alike, were dazzling, frosted
white. The shadows lay blackly on the
lawn. Near to the house was a well.
She heard the splash of the drops as
they fell from the little chartres, or
earthenware vessels that hung from the

VOL. III. p

wheel, Into the water deep down below.
The open doors showed the lighted
interior.

Stepping lightly Into the verandah,
she came to the long window of the
drawing-room, and stood hesitating 
for there was Lady Hermlone, seated
in a low wicker chair  alone. She was
dressed in white. Her magnificent black
hair was cut close to her head. She
looked pale, thin, miserable, as she sat
still, staring at vacancy.

Lady Hermlone ! '

She sprang up with a terrified stare
at the woman's figure in the doorway
and a stifled ' Ah ! '

I beg your pardon for having
startled you,' said Griselda. * I may
come in, may I not ? I am Griselda
Romaine.'

*Yes,' said Lady Hermione, In a dull,
stupefied way.

During these last days she had ceased
to care, almost to feel. She would have
welcomed any violent change, however
disastrous. There had been moments
when she thought that, if an overwhelming
force of the frantic hordes
were to break in upon the fort and
surrounding villages, she would awake
from this death in life with a fierce rejoicing
at the chance of a swift martyrdom
which might hurl her into a better
state. She told herself she had staked
her all  and that she had lost.

This sudden appearance of Griselda
was a slight relief. She would be free
to go  she knew not whither  to do
any desperate deed  she knew not what.

You were quite right to dare the

journey and to come, Mrs Romayne,'
she said in a dull, unemotional way.
Your husband mistook me for you
during his delirium, and, when he came
to his senses, was so disappointed not
to find his beloved wife, that he turned
his face to the wall and refused to be
comforted. Finding my presence unpleasant
to him, I have kept away
since then, only superintending the
nursing. He is orettino on well.'

By some subtle sympathy Griselda
knew this woman had dared all for
Hal, and he had repaid her  thus !
The tears rushed to her eyes. She
seized Lady Hermione's hand and
kissed it.

It was you who saved him,' she
said brokenly. * My poor thanks  what
are they ? God will repay you  you,

who have done the utmost one can do
for a friend  you, who have risked your
life for his ! '

'Life?' said Lady Hermione bitterly,
while her hand lay cold in Griselda's.
What a poor thing is life ! It is the
happy who value it ; but to the unhappy
it is a curse ! There is not much credit
in flinging away a curse, is there?' she
went on, with a sneering smile and a
flash of her dark eyes. ' But come to
your husband  or will you have wine 
food  before you go ? '

Griselda, affected by the despair of the
woman who, in her eyes  whatever she
might have done  was the preserver of
her Hal's life, briefly told her tale, then
followed Lady Hermione to her husband's
room.

At the door she halted. In her mingled

emotion this was an awful moment. He
had left her in full life, in bright  to her
almost glorious  manhood. What pitiful
wreck, what miserable remnant of a
human being lay beyond that closed door,
and was still her own husband, her childhood's
love, the little Prince who stepped
down into the orchard to her years ago
and took possession of her life ?

And, if it had not been for this devoted,
if reckless woman, there would have been
no Hal  only a grave, and a memory.

With a sudden passion of gratitude,
she held out her hand.

Let us go together, she said, with a
pleading tender look.

Lady Hermione shook her head A.vith
a bitter smile.

He must know  he must be told he
owes his life to you,' began Griselda.

Then suddenly she flung her arms
round the suffering beautiful creature,
and kissed her on the lips.

Thus Hals first kiss should be to
them both.

I will come back,' she said. ' Dear
Lady Hermione, I must see you soon
again ; ' then she opened the door and
went in boldly.

A dimly-lighted room ; a bed in the
coolest part, close under the swaying
frilled board, the punkah ; the odours of
pungent restoratives and disinfectants ; a
soldier sitting by the bedside.

He rose as she entered, saluted her,
and stared with amazement. But this
Corporal Haines, one of the young
captain's faithful military nurses, knew
without much thought that this could
be no other than the wife the sick man

had craved for with a weary persistence
painful to witness.

Captain,' he said cautiously, bending
over the form lying  oh, so still ! 
stretched upon the bed, ' here's a surprise
for you  a friend from home!'

He motioned to Griselda to stand back
in the shadow ; then he raised the sick
man In his arms

Could that be Hal  the thin livid
features, with a disfiguring scar across
one cheek  the great piteous eyes  all
the curls gone, and in their place bandages,
plaster  that white empty sleeve
rolled up ?

The loving wife sickened. How she
stepped across the room, knelt down,
and took him in her arms she could not
have told. Perhaps for a few moments
she tainted  she did not know. The

world seemed to sink away  the world,
with its anger, cruelty, revenge, turmoil
to sink away as the flood may suddenly
have stayed, sunk, and disappeared at
the voice of God  and they two, after
strup-o-le, dance-er, left alone, clinging to
each other as on some rock  saved.

Hal made slow but sure progress  the
new Captain Romayne ! Even Griselda
sometimes wondered and felt a sense of
unreality when she thought of the gay
impetuous Hal, and then looked at the
delicate invalid with the solemn eyes
that had such an unearthly searching
look in them

What the Captain wants now is
rousing, Mrs Romayne,' said the regimental
doctor who had ' patched up ' the
'ugly job,' as he had called Hal's casein

its beginning. 'If it were only
anxiety, even annoyance  Is he always
like this ? Does he never talk of the
past, or '  here the doctor hesitated,
but only for a moment  ' of future
hopes that should be cheering to a man,
should be a great object to live for?'

Griselda blushed, but this was no time
for feminine sensibility.

Not one word,' she said. *' He is
very good, wonderfully patient. I read
to him a little. But he only talks of
the small matters of the day itself  of
the Indian servants, their ways, the
weather, things like those. And, whenever
I turn my back for a moment, he
relapses into that dreamy state.'

I know  as if he were looking into
another world with those big eyes of his.
I've seen him. Of course, when you can

take him home, it will be all right  change
of scene and the sea-vovaoe. But that
can't be quite yet. Meanwhile I must
think of something.'

The doctor had thought already. He
knew the scandal about Lady Hermione.
It had grieved him, as it had grieved many
who where attached to the General, while
they had liked ' young Romayne,' and
admired the beautiful lady who had so unfortunately
fallen into hero-worship. He
attributed Hal's melancholy to a certain
remorse and a certain sense ol dishonour.
Now, as the doctor said to himself plausibly,
it was quite right for the young
fellow to regret having made mischief
between the General and his wife, so
long as the mischief was there. But
really, as everything was going well
now that his wife was here,

and he and she on the most loving
terms, while Mrs Romayne and Lady
Hermione corresponded or exchanged
messages daily, and the General seemed
quite content  a new man indeed  it
was high time that disagreeable bygones
should be bygones.

We should do with our mistakes
as with our dead leaves,' he went
on to himself, as he proceeded to
General Grayburgh's quarters to ask
him to come and see Hal. ' Malodorous
in themselves, they become almost
salutary in a bonfire.'

The General and his wife were reconciled.
And it came about thus. Lady
Hermione had remained in the bungalow
a few da's, at Griselda's instance. And
during those days she learnt the beauty of

meekness, the divinity ot forgiveness. In
the long talks between the two women,
Hermione found that there was scarcely
anything in her past relations with Captain
Romayne that was unknown to
his devoted wife, and that, without
doubt, whatever Griselda knew Griselda
had forgiven. During those days of utter
wretchedness, when Hal refused to see
her, would taste nothing her hands
had touched, and would shrink at the
very mention of her name, she had
been able to think of little but the
ofreat lost tenderness that had hitherto
come between her and the slightest
annoyance,  the vast protecting love
of her outraged husband.

General Gravburoh was a oreat, brood
man. Even on the terrible niorht, when in
her madness she had flung herself out of

his heart and outraged his honour, she
admired the nobility of his anger ; he had
made no expostulation, he had merely held
out his hand with a gesture of horror, and
had said one word,  ' Go ! '

During those calm hours in the
drawing-room with Griselda, when they
talked in a low voice while Hal slept in
his sick-room, she made a resolution.

If I do not get his pardon,' she
thought, ' at least I will ask it'

So one evening after she and Gris-ella
had dined, and Griselda had left
her to go to Hal, she went to her
room, put on a long dust-cloak and a
veil, and walked to the fort.

She did not know the pass word, and
the sentry hesitated to admit her. This
hesitation stung her to the quick, and
she imperiously flashed a well-known

ring of General Grayburgh's before his
eyes.

You forget yourself,' she said proudly,
and passed on.

Armed with this spirit of pride, she
gained his quarters, passed the sentry
there, and, flinging aside the curtain of
that stone chamber which was fraught
with so many strange troublous memories,
found herself standing face to
face with her gaunt, stern husband.

He rose as he saw her. They stood
gazing at each other for a few moments.
Then she said, with a desperate humility,
which was the subtlest pride 

I have come to ask your pardon
before I go away for ever.'

The General looked at her in wonder
then his head fell on his breast.

Oh, you poor, poor woman ! ' he

said falteringly. ' You come to me, a
man ! You ask me to right your soul 1
Go to your God ; he can forgive you 
not I, nor any man that has ever lived ! *

Then he went away into a corner,
where the rays of the lamps did not
reach, and leaned against a marble
pillar in his access of misery. Softened,
penitent, she followed him and fell weeping
against his shoulder.

You must forgive me first ! ' she sobbed.

And he took her into his arms, more
wretched than ever, and forgave her.

Poor girl ! I was too

old,' he said brokenly. I had no right
to bind you down.'

She had conquered. And the General
felt that he had lost many battles and
had been defeated otherwise, time aftertime,
elsewhere than in the field during

his long life ; but this was the first
occasion that he felt the utter littleness
of human glory, the utter abasement of
his erring human soul.

A few months later, Feather's Court,
in the gay beauty of the young summer,
was the scene of great rejoicing.

The new peal of bells presented to
the church by Hal as a thank-offering
were chiming merrily. For to-day, the
lusty boy who first saw light in the
Indian bungalow where his father had
struggled back to life, was to be publicly
received into the Church by his delighted
grandfather  whose first service this
would be since his return to England,
convalescent.

The new heir to the Romaynes was

a peculiar child, with fine, deep eyes.
VOL. III. Q

He was six months old that day, when
he sat up in his mother's arms and
looked steadily at the clergyman who
was admitting him into the Church.

Griselda had a new hope in this
world. What mattered the sad stormy
past ? Its dead were buried. This child,
this son of hers, had given her a new
life. She had awakened into a new
beauty ; she had at last something fresh
and pure from the hand of God to
live for.

Patience was over ! Now came the
reign of hopeful joy.
